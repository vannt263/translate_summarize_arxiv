    "the ability of controlling parts or subsystems of a quantum system is the main resource of a future quantum computer with its processing superiority over nowadays computers .",
    "such ability presupposes the control of local operations on parts of the system and its effects due to quantum correlations on other parts of the system .",
    "such quantum correlations among distinct parts of the system are encoded by the keyword entanglement  the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics , in the words of schrdinger .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to be able to quantify or measure how `` entangled '' the parts of the system are .",
    "this is the reason of the great effort being carried in the past decades to elucidate the notion of quantum entanglement .",
    "entanglement has been studied in diverse systems , the simplest and most studied being those associated with quadratic spinless fermionic chains .",
    "these are related via a ( non - local ) jordan - wigner transformation to simple spin systems such as ising , xx and xy with an external magnetic coupling .",
    "it is fair to say that nowadays we have a good control of almost all aspects of quantum correlations in such systems .",
    "such achievement were possible due to the sophisticate resolution of diverse mathematical problems , most of them associated with the computation of the determinant of correlation matrices  usually of the block toeplitz type due to translational symmetry .",
    "the sophistication may be appreciated by noting that such computations are instances of the riemann - hilbert problem ( rhp ) .",
    "this fact brings in a geometrical flavour to the study of entanglement entropy for such systems .",
    "it is a question of the analysis of the topology of a certain riemann surface associated to the system .    in the framework of this successful ideology , we can find two classes of block toeplitz matrices @xcite . on one hand , those which can be reduced to a pure toeplitz one , with scalar symbol , where the fisher - hartwig theorem @xcite is the key to obtain an asymptotic expansion of our determinant",
    "that is the case of spinless fermionic chains described by a hamiltonian which preserves the fermionic number . in this way ,",
    "jin and korepin @xcite obtained a formula for the von neumann entropy associated to a set of contiguous sites in the xx spin chain . using the same philosophy ,",
    "the rnyi entropy of an interval for every stationary state of a general quadratic spinless fermionic hamiltonian which preserves the number of excitations is obtained in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have those block toeplitz matrices which can not be reduced to a scalar one ; as usually happens when the above number symmetry is broken .",
    "in general , we can not bypass the rhp . confronting it ,",
    "its , jin and korepin @xcite obtained a formula for the von neumann entanglement entropy associated to a set of contiguous sites in the xy spin chain .",
    "an expression for the rnyi entropy was then written down by franchini , its and korepin @xcite .",
    "later the von neumann entropy for the case of quadratic spinless fermionic chains with finite range coupling was provided by its , mezzadri and mo @xcite . in a different spirit , using a duality transformation , peschel @xcite obtained the same kind of formula for the xy spin chain .",
    "later on , kdar and zimbors @xcite started a systematic analysis of the entanglement entropy for self - dual models with broken reflection symmetry .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this self - dual case the block toeplitz matrix analysis reduces to that of a scalar toeplitz matrix .    in this work ,",
    "we extend further the above sequence of complexities by considering the rnyi entanglement entropy for quadratic spinless fermionic chains with complex finite range couplings . due to the complex nature of the couplings , some new possibilities , to our knowledge not known in the literature , appear .",
    "we have to deal with some interesting challenges associated with some discontinuities in the symbol of a block toeplitz matrix . as a resolution of these challenges",
    "we here propose a new formula for the determinant of such toeplitz matrix with @xmath1 symbol ( [ conjecture ] ) : @xmath2\\mathrm{d}\\theta   + \\log |x| \\sum_{j=1}^j b_j + \\cdots,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 encapsulates the information due to the discontinuities of the symbol .",
    "the important fact of this formula is its logarithmic scaling with the size of the subsystem @xmath4 .",
    "as an application of this new formula , we proceed to an exhaustive analysis of the entropy computation of a spin chain with dzyaloshinski - moriya ( dm ) coupling and a kitaev fermionic chain with long range pairing .    as stated by its , mezzadri and mo in @xcite , `` ... at the core of our derivation of the entropy of entanglement",
    "is the computation of determinants of toeplitz matrices for a wide class of @xmath1 matrix symbols . '' .",
    "the @xmath1 matrix character of these symbols stems from the non - invariance of the fermionic number .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of the xy model .",
    "we also consider finite range couplings ; being the kitaev chain with long range pairing an example .",
    "the novelty in our work lies in the complex nature of the couplings .",
    "this feature allows one to consider systems with broken reflection and/or charge conjugation .",
    "an example of a system with broken reflection symmetry is the dm spin chain .",
    "when considering such systems with broken reflection and/or charge conjugation , we obtain a wider moduli of system , among those one may encounter systems with critical behaviour .",
    "such systems are expected to display an entropy that scales logarithmically with the size of the system .",
    "this is indeed what we obtain when we use our proposed formula for the determinant of the block toeplitz matrix in the rnyi entropy formula .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the general hamiltonian for a spinless fermionic chain with finite range coupling and define the fock space of states ; in section 3 , we review the well known relation between the entropy and the correlation matrix and in ( [ symbol ] ) we derive the latter for a general stationary state ; in section 4 , we compute the determinant of the block toeplitz matrix , first in the smooth case where the its , mezzadri and mo s formula ( [ determinant ] ) applies , and then by extending it in ( [ conjecture ] ) to the case where discontinuities are present ; later we use this result to obtain our general expression ( [ entropy ] ) for the asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement entropy in a critical theory with long range couplings and the above broken symmetries ; in sections 5 and 6 , we apply the formulae of previous section for an analysis of the entropy in the dm spin chain model and in a kitaev chain with long range pairing respectively ; finally , section 7 contains our conclusions .",
    "let us consider an @xmath5-site chain of size @xmath6 with @xmath5 spinless fermions described by a quadratic , translational invariant hamiltonian with finite range couplings ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the annihilation and creation operators at the site @xmath11 .",
    "the only non - vanishing anticommutation relations are @xmath12 and in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) we assume @xmath13 .    in order that @xmath14 is hermitian , the hopping couplings must satisfy @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , without loss of generality , we may take @xmath16 . when @xmath17 , @xmath18 , our hamiltonian preserves the fermionic number . if @xmath19 is not real the reflection symmetry ( @xmath20 ) is broken",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath21 breaks charge conjugation ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we can express @xmath14 in terms of uncoupled fermion modes .",
    "first , given the translational invariance of the hamiltonian , we introduce the fourier modes @xmath23 notice that by construction @xmath24 .",
    "the hamiltonian in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can now be written as @xmath25 with @xmath26 which is real , @xmath27 which is an odd function of @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 , and @xmath30    the matrix @xmath31 is hermitian and satisfies @xmath32 therefore we can introduce the dispersion relation @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , such that the diagonalization of @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 a unitary matrix . the order ambiguity in the eigenvalues",
    "is fixed if we demand that @xmath38 .",
    "thus the dispersion relation is univocally determined .",
    "we can now write the hamiltonian in diagonal form by performing a bogoliubov transformation to the new modes @xmath39 in terms of which @xmath14 reads @xmath40 @xmath33 can be derived from the relations @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 finally we get @xmath44    an eigenstate of @xmath14 is determined by a subset of occupied modes @xmath45 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath46 the vacuum of the fock space for the new modes , i.e. @xmath47 , the stationary state @xmath48 has energy @xmath49 in particular , the ground state will be obtained by filling the modes with negative energy ( dirac sea ) @xmath50 with energy @xmath51    note that if @xmath52 the dispersion relation is positive and the ground state of @xmath14 is @xmath46 . on the contrary , if there are some momenta with @xmath53 a dirac sea develops , hence the ground state has occupied modes and differs from the fock space vacuum . in this case , the ground state is not invariant under reflection in momentum space @xmath54 . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "this fact has important consequences for the evaluation of the entanglement entropy and its behaviour near the boundaries of the critical region .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the rnyi entanglement entropy for the ground state of a hamiltonian of the kind analysed in the previous section . for the moment , however , we keep the general discussion by considering a general stationary state @xmath55 as defined in ( [ eigenstates ] ) .    given a subsystem @xmath0 of contiguous sites of the fermionic chain , with complementary set @xmath56",
    "we have the corresponding factorization of the hilbert space @xmath57 .",
    "if the system is in the pure state @xmath55 , the reduced density matrix for @xmath0 is obtained by taking the partial trace with respect to @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the rnyi entanglement entropy of @xmath0 is defined by @xmath60    in order to compute @xmath61 we take advantage of the fact that the state @xmath55 satisfies the wick decomposition property and , as it is well known @xcite , the reduced density matrix can be obtained from the two point correlation function .    for any pair of sites",
    "@xmath62 , we introduce the following correlation matrix , @xmath63 notice that @xmath64 is a @xmath65 matrix .    following @xcite",
    "one can show that the rnyi entanglement entropy reads @xmath66,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the @xmath65 identity matrix .    from the numerical side , this formula supposes a drastic improvement of computational capabilities .",
    "in fact , the dimension of @xmath68 is @xmath69 , so the cost of calculating @xmath61 grows , in principle , exponentially with the length of the interval .",
    "however , @xmath64 has only dimension @xmath70 , allowing one to reach larger sizes of @xmath0 .",
    "we can derive a useful way of implementing ( [ entcorrel ] ) by applying cauchy s residue theorem , so that @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73,\\ ] ] and @xmath74 is the contour depicted in fig .",

    "we first rewrite it in the fourier basis , @xmath77 with @xmath78 or in terms of the bogoliubov modes @xmath79 we now compute the expectation value in the stationary state @xmath55 associated to the occupation @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the characteristic function of @xmath83 , i.e. it is 1 or 0 according to whether @xmath28 belongs to @xmath83 or not .",
    "now , introducing @xmath84 we finally arrive at @xmath85 notice that the symbol of @xmath64 at momentum @xmath28 depends not only on the occupation number at @xmath28 but also at @xmath86 .",
    "this is a general fact that , to our knowledge , has been overlooked in the literature .",
    "we believe that there are two reasons for that .",
    "first , if @xmath87 and we are interested in a ground state like that in @xcite , then we have @xmath88 .",
    "hence any consideration on the occupation numbers is superfluous .",
    "the symbol is @xmath89 and that is all .",
    "the second situation corresponds to general stationary states , like in @xcite where the whole casuistics in the computation of the symbol would play a role .",
    "however in these papers , like in @xcite one has @xmath90 , therefore @xmath89 is diagonal , the symbol can be considered scalar instead of a 2 by 2 matrix and the discussion above is not necessary .",
    "in this paper we are interested in computing @xmath61 for the ground state .",
    "as it is well known , it contains information on the critical properties of the system . following the previous discussion , it is determined by the occupation set @xmath91 since @xmath92 , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , applying the general expression in ( [ symbol ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath95 note that for the vacuum state , and due to the fact that @xmath96 , one can not have that @xmath33 and @xmath97 are both negative implying that the first case in ( [ symbol ] ) never happens .    in the so - called thermodynamic limit , @xmath98 , @xmath99 with",

    "in this section we compute an expression for @xmath106 for large @xmath4 .",

    "the symbol @xmath113 is therefore continuous .",
    "this situation has been analysed before in the notable papers @xcite when @xmath114 and @xmath115 is imaginary .",
    "their results can be straightforwardly generalised to our case provided @xmath116    the generalisation goes as follows .",
    "we first define the meromorphic complex functions @xmath117 that are related to @xmath118 and @xmath119 , from ( [ fk - def-1 ] ) and ( [ gk - def-1 ] ) , by @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we also introduce the symmetric and antisymmetric part of @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath125 and @xmath126 , these functions satisfy @xmath127 and this , together with ( [ condg ] ) , implies @xmath128 we now define the polynomial @xmath129 with @xmath130 . from the symmetries of @xmath122 and @xmath131",
    "one can show that @xmath132 have real coefficients .",
    "moreover , the roots of @xmath133 come in pairs @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we include the possibility of a global phase @xmath136 for completeness , but actually it is easy to get rid of it by performing a redefinition of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "in fact , by introducing @xmath137 the new meromorphic functions are @xmath138 , @xmath139 , therefore @xmath140 and the global phase is absent .",
    "we assume that @xmath133 is generic in the sense that it has @xmath141 different single roots .",
    "then the complex curve @xmath142 defines a riemann surface of genus @xmath143 .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite , in the limit of large @xmath4 , @xmath107 can be expressed in terms of analytic invariants of the riemann surface @xmath144 .",
    "namely , we make a choice of branch cuts in the @xmath145 plane that do not cross the unit circle and a basis of fundamental cycles such that every @xmath146-cycle surrounds anticlockwise one of the cuts with the last @xmath147 of them corresponding to the cuts outside the unit circle .",
    "associated to this choice we have a canonically defined theta function , @xmath148 , given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the @xmath151 period matrix .",
    "now , one has the following expression for the asymptotic value of the determinant ( proposition 1 of @xcite ) : @xmath152 where the dots represent terms that vanish in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "the argument of the theta function contains @xmath153 @xmath154 which is a @xmath155 dimensional vector whose first @xmath156 entries are 0 and the last @xmath147 are 1 and the constant @xmath155-tuple @xmath157 is determined once we fix which of the roots of @xmath133 are also roots of its first factor @xmath158 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "we move on now to discuss the other case , in which @xmath159 for some open intervals in @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "the symbol now has discontinuities at the boundaries of the interval where @xmath161 .    up to now , in the presence of such discontinuities none of the known results on block toeplitz matrices",
    "can be applied to obtain the asymptotic behaviour for the determinant .",
    "we here propose a procedure that covers this gap in the literature , so that one can compute the asymptotics of the determinant in this case .    before presenting the new procedure ,",
    "let us recap some facts about toeplitz matrices with scalar symbol with discontinuities and the corresponding fisher - hartwig theorem @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider a genuine toeplitz matrix , i.e. one with a scalar symbol @xmath162 .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath162 is a piecewise smooth symbol with jump discontinuities at @xmath163 and lateral limits @xmath164 at the discontinuities",
    ". then from the discontinuities we get a logarithmic contribution to @xmath107 , whose asymptotic expansion reads @xmath165\\mathrm{d}\\theta   + \\log|x| \\sum_{j=1}^j \\frac1{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\log\\frac{\\lambda - t_j^{- } } { \\lambda - t_j^{+}}\\right)^2+\\cdots,\\ ] ] where now the dots represent finite contributions in the large @xmath4 limit , that can be computed explicitly but are not going to be necessary for us .",
    "the crucial fact is that contrary to the linear term ( and also the constant one ) the logarithmic contribution only depends on the behaviour of the symbol near its discontinuities , more concretely on its lateral limits .",
    "the previous observation can be used to compute the logarithmic term for a block toeplitz matrix in some particular cases .",
    "assume that a two - dimensional symbol @xmath166 presents a discontinuity at say @xmath167 .",
    "we shall assume that the lateral limits , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , commute . if the two matrices commute there is a basis where both are diagonal .",
    "call @xmath170 and @xmath171 the corresponding eigenvalues at each side of the discontinuity .",
    "inspired by the fisher - hartwig theorem for the scalar case , we argue that the contribution of this discontinuity to the logarithmic term of the determinant only depends on the value of @xmath166 at each side of the jump or more concretely on its eigenvalues . explicitly the contribution of the discontinuity to the coefficient of the logarithmic term of @xmath172 is @xmath173.\\ ] ] now if we have several discontinuities with commuting lateral limits there is a logarithmic contribution @xmath3 , like the one above , for each of them .",

    "it is one of the main new contributions of this work .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend this to the case when the two lateral limits do not commute .",
    "so far we have been unable to accomplish this goal .",
    "fortunately , in order to study the fermionic chain that we consider in this paper , the stated result is enough .    after this general discussion we proceed to study the asymptotic behaviour for the entanglement entropy in the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) when the symbol in the thermodynamic limit is not continuous .",
    "the latter can be written @xmath175    the first thing one should notice is that if @xmath176 has a discontinuity at @xmath177 it has also another one at @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , discontinuities come in pairs except those at @xmath179 or @xmath180",
    ".    we will now analyse the type of discontinuities and their contribution to the logarithmic term .",
    "the first situation is when the two lateral limits are @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "obviously , the two limits commute and we can therefore apply ( [ logcoeff ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath181 are @xmath183 ( indeed , @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) , which implies that its contribution to the @xmath186 term of ( [ conjecture ] ) is @xmath187    the second type of discontinuity is when the lateral limits are @xmath188 and @xmath189 , in this case the two eigenvalues @xmath183 are different in both sides and we get a contribution @xmath190    finally it is also possible that the matrix @xmath181 itself is discontinuous .",
    "this may happen when @xmath191 and @xmath119 vanish for some values of @xmath177 and at least one of them goes linearly to zero . in this case",
    "the two lateral limits have opposite sign and the contribution to the logarithmic term is @xmath192    from the above ingredients we can compute the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant for the four archetypical situations sketched in fig .",

    "they have @xmath259 note that the logarithmic term agrees with our general result .",
    "another interesting property of this theory is that when we approach the critical zone b from 1a or 2 , the entropy saturates at a larger and larger value that grows logarithmically with the correlation length ( or the inverse of the mass gap ) .",
    "this is the expected behaviour that has been predicted from the properties of conformal field theories @xcite and has been verified numerical and analytically in many models .    as for the boundary of region",
    "a , it can be reached from inside the region or from outside .",
    "these two limits are completely different .",
    "of course , inside the critical region the entropy diverges logarithmically with the length of the interval and , what matters for us , the coefficient of this term is constant throughout all the region .",
    "contrary to this behaviour , the constant coefficient in the asymptotic expansion of the entropy does change inside region a and it indeed diverges with negative values when we tend to any boundary . if , we now study the case in which we approach zone a from any of the non critical ones ( 1a , 1b or 2 ) we find that the entanglement entropy of the interval saturates in the limit at a finite value , which is different at any point of the boundary but independent of the path ( always inside the non critical region ) that we follow to reach the point .",
    "note that this behaviour is anomalous in the sense that , as we mentioned before , one expects an exponential divergence of the entropy with the inverse of the mass gap . recall that in the non critical regions 1a , 1b and 2 the ground state is the fock space vacuum for the bogoliubov modes ; the same occurs in the critical region b. on the contrary , in region a the ground state has all bogoliubov modes with negative energy occupied ( the dirac sea ) .",
    "the above behaviour of the entropy near the transition could be a sign of this _ discontinuity _ in the ground state .",
    "in fact , we find a similar issue in the xx spin chain ( i.e. when @xmath260 ) . in that case",
    ", the entropy always vanishes when @xmath261 , it does not diverge with the inverse of the mass gap when we approach the critical point @xmath224 , and the ground state is the fock space vacuum . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath262 , the von neumann entropy scales like @xmath263 while the constant correction diverges to negative values when we approach the essential critical point . in this region",
    "a dirac sea develops and the ground state has occupied all the modes with negative energy .",
    "the situation is , therefore , very similar to what we obtained for the dm model .    from a global point of view , this behaviour in the border of region a can be interpreted as a blow up of the essential critical point of ref .",
    "the different possible values for the limit of the entropy at that point ( for @xmath245 ) are obtained at different points of the boundary of region a for @xmath264 and the singularity at @xmath224 , @xmath250 disappears in this case .",
    "as a further application of the previous results we shall discuss the case in which the couplings extend throughout the whole chain . the example is adapted from @xcite and it serves to illustrate how to use the tools of the preceding sections to determine the scaling behaviour of the entropy in a theory with long range couplings .",
    "the hamiltonian represents a kitaev chain with power like decaying pairing , i. e. @xmath265 where the exponent @xmath266 characterises the dumping of the coupling with distance .",
    "its value will happen to be critical to determine the scaling behaviour of the entropy .",
    "following the discussion in section 4 and taking the thermodynamic limit , @xmath98 , we define @xmath267 where @xmath268 stands for the polylogarithm of order @xmath269 .",
    "this is a multivalued function , analytic outside the real interval @xmath270 and , what is going to be most important for us , has a finite limit at @xmath271 for @xmath272 while it diverges at that point for @xmath273 .",
    "if we introduce now @xmath274 which is a purely imaginary function , the dispersion relation reads @xmath275 and vanishes at @xmath197 for @xmath224 and at @xmath179 for @xmath276 and @xmath272 .",
    "these are the two instances in which the mass gap is zero .",
    "an interesting feature of this model is that , as we shall see , it may have logarithmic scaling of the entropy even when it has non zero mass gap .",
    "notice that @xmath277 and therefore the formalism of section 4 can be applied , we also have @xmath278 which corresponds to cases @xmath200 or @xmath279 in section 4 .",
    "hence , to uncover the possible logarithmic scaling of the entropy we must simply look for discontinuities of the matrix @xmath280    one source of discontinuities comes from the zeros of the dispersion relation , this corresponds to the cases @xmath200 or @xmath279 discussed in section 4 . in our model",
    "the only zeros appear at @xmath179 for @xmath276 or @xmath197 for @xmath224 and the two lateral limits of @xmath281 at the discontinuity are @xmath282 .",
    "therefore they contribute to the effective central charge for the scaling of the entanglement entropy with @xmath283 .",
    "note that this contribution has its origin in the absence of mass gap , i. e. it is connected to the universality class of a conformal field theory .",
    "the other possible discontinuities are related to the divergences of @xmath115 at @xmath179 ; these happen for @xmath284 and any value of @xmath210 .",
    "the two lateral limits are also @xmath285 and the discontinuity contributes with @xmath283 to the scaling of the entropy . if @xmath224 this contribution must be added to the one coming from the zero of the dispersion relation at @xmath197 , therefore the total central charge is @xmath286 .",
    "when @xmath276 such an addition does not happen as the two discontinuitites are actually the same and the total central charge is @xmath283 .",
    "all these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ kitaev ] where the different regions , according to the value of @xmath200 , are shown .",
    "the white region of central charge @xmath287 corresponds to @xmath272 and @xmath288 ; in black we represent the region with @xmath286 i. e. @xmath224 and @xmath273 ; the rest in gray corresponds to @xmath283 .",
    "plane according the the coefficient of the logarithmic scaling for the entanglement entropy .",
    "white area stands for @xmath287 , grey region for @xmath283 and the black one for @xmath286 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    our analytic results are very much compatible with the numeric findings of @xcite , where the regions we have determined appear smeared somehow .",
    "we interpret this fact as the consequence of finite size corrections to the thermodynamic limit that we are presently considering .",
    "note that for comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite one should bear in mind that their parameters @xmath289 and @xmath290 correspond to @xmath269 and @xmath291 in our paper .",
    "another interesting remark is that the results above can be applied to any family of long range couplings with the same asymptotic behaviour for large @xmath292 and constant sign .",
    "in fact , our discussion was based on the limiting behaviour of @xmath119 at @xmath179 and the latter is governed solely by the asymptotic behaviour of the power series .",
    "in this paper , we extend further the understanding of entanglement entropy in spinless fermionic chains considering translational invariant hamiltonians with finite range couplings breaking the fermionic number , the reflection and the charge conjugation symmetries .",
    "the first violation implies to deal with block toeplitz determinants while the second one can create bogoliubov modes with negative energy .",
    "the latter breaking leads to discontinuities in the symbol of our block toeplitz matrix . to our knowledge",
    ", this possibility has not been considered in the literature . here",
    ", we have performed a systematic analysis of their physical origin , nature and contribution to the entanglement entropy of a set of contiguous sites in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for the last point , we have carried out an heuristic study based on the fact that the contribution of each discontinuity only depends on the value of the symbol at each side of the jump .",
    "thereby , we conclude that each of them adds a logarithmic term with the size of the interval to the entropy",
    ". this method also allows to determine its coefficient which informs about the universality class of the critical theory . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", our result requires that the two lateral limits of the symbol at the discontinuity commute .",
    "although this is enough for our physical problem , it will be a very interesting mathematical question to study the case in which the two lateral limits do not commute .",
    "when the reflection symmetry breaking does not produce bogoliubov modes with negative energy , the expressions found by its , mezzadri and mo can still be applied .",
    "here we have also shown that it can be extended to certain cases where the charge conjugation symmetry is broken .",
    "we have applied this general analysis to a xy spin chain with transverse magnetic field and dzyaloshinski - moriya coupling .",
    "this system has two critical regions as was previously pointed out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we determine that one region belongs to the ising universality class while another one region corresponds to the xx universality class .",
    "the latter can be seen as a blowing up , produced by the dm coupling , of the xx critical line of the xy spin chain with only magnetic coupling .",
    "we have also tested our formula in a theory with longe range couplings , a kitaev fermionic chain with power like decaying pairing . in this case , the logarithmic scaling of the entropy is affected by the dumping of the coupling with the distance . for sufficiently small values , it produces a discontinuity in the symbol of the correlation matrix . as a result , for zero mass gap and positive chemical potential , the univesality class of the critical theory changes from the xx class ( for small values of the dumping ) to the ising class ( when the dumping is sufficiently large ) .",
    "in addition , this discontinuity implies that the entropy may have a logarithmic scaling when the mass gap is not null .",
    "our analytical study is in a great deal agree with the numeric results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the difference is that the regions we have precisely delimitated here , appear blurred in @xcite .",
    "we interpret this fact as a consequence of finite size corrections to the thermodynamic limit we consider here .",
