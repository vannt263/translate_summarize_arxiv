    "the human interaction paradigm with music playback devices has seen a dramatic shift as devices get smaller and more portable .",
    "well - established interaction media such as remote controls are no longer adequate .",

    "are highly challenging due to the music playback itself , the environmental noise , and the general environmental acoustics , e.g. , reverberation @xcite .",
    "in particular , due to the severe degradation of the input signal , the asr performance drops significantly when the distance between the user and the microphone increases @xcite . in the past decade , the literature on distant - talking speech interfaces provided several solutions to the problem , e.g. , the dicit project @xcite .",
    "however , to the authors knowledge , the available solutions rely heavily on large microphone arrays @xcite , which may be infeasible for handheld portable device .    in this work",
    ", we present a robust front - end speech enhancement and asr solution for a single - microphone limited - vocabulary system during continuous monaural music playback .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , the microphone in our system is placed in close proximity to the loudspeakers , and the voice command still needs to be recognized at a very low while the music is playing .    the front - end algorithm design effort can be divided in two parts .",
    "firstly , we tailor known double - talk robust solutions for echo cancellation and speech enhancement to retrieve a clean estimate of the command @xcite .",
    "secondly , we propose a novel noise reduction method , where we combine a traditional speech enhancement approach @xcite with an estimate of the ideal binary mask @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the algorithm are tuned for maximum recognition rate by casting the tuning problem as a nonlinear program , solved efficiently through a genetic algorithm ( ga ) @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was used in @xcite to maximize the objective perceptual quality of a speech enhancement system for full - duplex communication .",
    "the training and evaluation corpora are generated through a synthetic mixture of clean speech ( from the timit database @xcite ) and music , both convolved with separate impulse responses , and further mixed with a background noise to cover as many deployment scenarios as possible .",
    "the acoustic models of the asr are trained by the front - end enhanced speech , an effective way to learn and exploit the typical distortions of the system itself @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : algorithm ] , we describe the speech enhancement algorithm and outline the parameters to be tuned .",
    "the tuning by nonlinear optimization of these parameters is presented in section [ sec : tuning ] .",
    "the experimental results in section  [ sec : speechtimit ] are divided in two parts .",
    "firstly , we present the results of the training and evaluation of the front - end and acoustic models using the timit database .",
    "secondly , we change the language model and implement our asr system for a limited vocabulary command recognizer in very adverse conditions . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude our work .",

    "the overall block diagram of the speech enhancement algorithm is shown in figure  [ fig : wholesystem ] , which consists of two , a estimator , two , a , a , and a .",
    "since strong near - end interference may corrupt the error signal of the and cause the adaptive filter to diverge , the system @xcite is used , where the error recovery nonlinearity and robust adaptive step - size control allows for continuous tracking of the echo path during double talk . to reduce the delay of the frequency - domain adaptive filter @xcite , the multi - delay adaptive filter structure @xcite is used .",
    "a cascaded structure similar to the system approach of @xcite is used : the output of the first is fed to the input of the second , which is different from the original system approach in @xcite where the input to the second is still the microphone signal ( a parallel structure instead of the cascaded structure used in this work ) .",
    "the tuning parameters for each of the consist of the frame size @xmath8 , the number of partitioned blocks @xmath9 , the number of iterations @xmath10 , the step - size @xmath11 , the tuning parameter @xmath12 for the robust adaptive step - size , and the smoothing factor @xmath13 for the power spectral density estimation .      since the can not cancel all the echo signal due to modeling mismatch , further enhancement from the is required to improve the voice quality .",
    "a coherence based method similar to @xcite is used for the , and a modified version of the estimator similar to @xcite is used for a more accurate estimate of the residual echo power . as",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : wholesystem ] , the estimator differs from that in @xcite since the coherence is calculated between the estimated echo signal @xmath14 and the microphone signal @xmath15 rather than between the loudspeaker signal @xmath16 and the microphone signal @xmath15 .",
    "this is possible since the estimated echo signal @xmath14 can be reliably obtained even during double talk due to the _ robust _ echo path tracking performance of the .    in this work",
    ", we propose to estimate the residual echo power by utilizing the output of the double talk probability estimator .",
    "ideally , when the double - talk probability is high , the level of residual echo power estimate should be low so as to not distort the near - end speech when suppressing the residual echo",
    ". on the other hand , when the double - talk probability is low , the level of residual echo power estimate should be high to suppress as much residual echo as possible .",

    "it has been recently shown that the speech recognition accuracy in noisy condition can be greatly improved by direct binary masking @xcite when compared to marginalization @xcite or spectral reconstruction @xcite .",
