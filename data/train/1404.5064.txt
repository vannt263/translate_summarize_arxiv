    "recent developments in the context of smart grid , smart transportation , and the internet have given rise to a rich set of optimization problems in which a number of agents collaborate to achieve a social optimum @xcite .",
    "for example , collaborative cruise control systems are emerging in which a group of vehicles on a stretch of road share information to determine a speed limit that minimizes fuel consumption subject to some constraint ( traffic flow , pollution constraints , etc . ) .",
    "other examples of this problem can be found in several application domains ; in the energy literature @xcite ; in the electric vehicles literature @xcite , in distributed load control @xcite ; in the study of control strategies for thermostatically controlled loads , as refrigerators or air conditioners @xcite , and of course , in the optimization literature itself @xcite .    roughly speaking the optimization problems that emerge in such applications are simple to solve .",
    "typically , one wishes to minimize a sum of strictly convex functions of a single variable subject to a linear , or perhaps , polynomial constraint .",
    "it is well known that such problems can be readily solved by a multitude of methods in a convex optimization framework @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding this fact , solving these problems in a smart grid or smart transportation framework is challenging .",
    "the difficulties that arise in such environments are due to several factors .",
    "first one wishes to find solutions which can be implemented with minimal communication ( or even none ) between individual agents , and between the agents and infrastructure .",
    "this need arises due to the fact that many of these problems are massively large scale in nature , and continuous inter - agent communication would place an undue burden on the telecommunications infrastructure @xcite and due to privacy considerations .",
    "the second difficulty is that the number of agents participating in the optimization problem is large and time - varying , and each agent s utility is private and is not communicated to other agents in order to preserve this privacy .",
    "an additional further difficulty arises because agents in such applications typically have limited actuation capabilities , i.e. limited capabilities of effecting a change in their state . for example , in _ internet of things applications _ agents can often only influence their behavior by switching themselves on or off .",
    "thus , distributed algorithms for solving large scale optimization problems in which agents with limited actuation capabilities collaborate to achieve a common goal , is a highly topical research problem .",
    "our objective in this paper is to develop algorithms that can be deployed in such situations . to this end , consider a network of @xmath0 agents , each with a state @xmath1 , @xmath2 representing an amount of allocated resource .",
    "the allocated resource will be updated at discrete time instances @xmath3 , where in implementations a common clock is not required .",
    "the agents also keep track of their individual long term average @xmath4 we assume an upper bound @xmath5 of the possible use of resources . to each agent",
    "we associate a cost function @xmath6 \\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] .",
    "we consider the problem of network - wide optimal allocation , which can be stated as @xmath7 under suitable convexity assumption this optimization problem has a unique optimal point @xmath8 .",
    "we wish to steer the average values @xmath9 to the optimal point , i.e. we are looking for an algorithm such that @xmath10 further , we wish to do this with as little inter - agent communication as possible , and with a minimum amount of centralized actuation .",
    "as we shall see inter - agent communication is not necessary at all to achieve convergence to the optimum , nor is it necessary to communicate a feedback signal in the form of a multiplier .",
    "rather , we will show that it is sufficient to provide the centralized , one - bit information , that the constraint has been reached .",
    "furthermore , the conditions for convergence are independent of network dimension , depending only on the worst agent in the system .",
    "+ all this can be achieved using only the _ additive - increase multiplicative decrease _ ( aimd ) algorithm . recall that aimd is an algorithm in which agents continuously claim more and more of the available resource in a gentle fashion until a notification ( of a capacity event ) is sent to them that the aggregate amount of available resource has been exceeded .",
    "this is the additive increase ( ai ) phase of the algorithm .",
    "they then reduce their demand on resource by a factor between zero and one .",
    "this is the multiplicative decrease ( md ) of the algorithm .",
    "the ai phase of the algorithm then restarts immediately . in the algorithm",
    "each agent will respond to the capacity signal with a certain probability @xmath11 .",
    "the key observation is that by choosing @xmath11 as a function of the long term average @xmath12 we may achieve convergence to the optimal point @xmath13 without any communication besides the capacity signal .    to motivate this result , we make use of the following two known observations .    _",
    "observation 1 ( consensus ) : _ the optimization problem may be formulated in a lagrangian framework as follows .",
    "we introduce the lagrange parameter @xmath14 and consider @xmath15 from the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.5.3 ) , the following necessary and sufficient condition for optimality can be obtained by setting all partial derivatives to zero . if we assume that the optimal point @xmath8 has only positive entries , then the inequality constraints @xmath16 are not active . in this case",
    "it is easy to see that the multipliers corresponding to the inequality constraints vanish in the kkt conditions .",
    "so under the assumption of positivity of the optimal point @xmath17 , @xmath18 we have @xmath19 in other words , the system is at optimality when the derivatives of the utility functions are in consensus .",
    "we will show in lemma  [ lem : posoptimalpoint ] that the assumptions to be imposed for our algorithm imply that the optimal point is positive and so does indeed characterize the optimal point .",
    "_ observation 2 ( ergodic behavior ) : _ it follows from the results in @xcite , under the assumptions of ergodicity , that the ergodic limit of a network of aimd flows is almost surely of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a network - specific constant and @xmath11 is the steady - state probability that the @xmath22th aimd agent responds to a notification of a capacity event .    with these two observations in mind , we can now aim to choose place - dependent probability functions @xmath23 so that the equation for the steady state behavior is equivalent to the kkt condition .",
    "suppose that , in the @xmath24th iteration , each agent responds to a capacity event with probability @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the average of the last @xmath24 values of @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is a network wide constant chosen to ensure that @xmath29 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath30",
    ". then we can write @xmath31 .",
    "provided that for this choice holds , we obtain for large @xmath24 @xmath32 and so @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "these are precisely the kkt conditions which in many cases are both necessary and sufficient for optimality .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the above intuition is true .",
    "specifically , with the place - dependent probabilities @xmath23 chosen as in , we do indeed have @xmath35 for large @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the _ aimd _ algorithm can be modified to solve distributed optimization problems in asynchronous environments in a manner that is both effective and efficient in terms of communication overhead .",
    "our paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin by reviewing a recently proposed switched systems model of aimd dynamics and known results on the stochastic stability of this model for fixed probabilities .",
    "the main result for fixed probabilities is that the long term averages converge almost surely and that this limit can be expressed analytically .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : prelims ] by introducing notation and recalling some facts about the dynamics of stochastic aimd algorithms . in section 3",
    "we present a discussion of a stochastic aimd algorithm that solves the num problem . in section  4",
    "we introduce two dynamical systems , representing these algorithms .",
    "these differ in the choice of the probability laws .",
    "we then state the main convergence results .",
    "related works are discussed in section  [ sec : relworks ] . in section  [ sec : example ] we apply the results to solve the num problem for a network of agents . the main proofs",
    "are provided in the appendix .",
    "there , we give intermediate results that link the fixed probability case with the place - dependent case . specifically , we ask to what degree may the place dependent case be approximated with the fixed probability case , and over which time intervals . to this end",
    "we study the robustness properties of a deterministic system that iterates on the expectation operator .",
    "these results are then used to establish the main result of the paper .    * the main contribution * of this paper is to propose a new technique for solving a num problem that can be used in iot related situations .",
    "various techniques exist for solving such problems and we shall enunciate the difference of our method , with respect to these , in the related work section later in the paper . however , since aimd is so closely related to transmission control protocol ( tcp ) , and since tcp can be studied in an optimization framework , several brief comments are merited at this point to avoid any confusion .",
    "first , we do not account for queues in the network , nor do we assume that these give rise to a loss process . also , we do not use ode s , or fluid like approximations , to model our network . rather , we study an exact discrete time system that arises in the study of aimd dynamics , without queues , in which losses are governed agents themselves in the network . in other words , and in the language of tcp , in our setting losses are generated at the edge , unlike most tcp systems , in which losses are generated at the center via queuing dynamics .",
    "our principal concern is to determine rules by which agents generate these losses so that certain optimization problems can be solved .",
    "all together , this gives rise to a `` markov - like '' system which requires special machinery for its study , and a large part of this paper is devoted to developing this machinery .",
    "our starting point is the suite of algorithms that underpin the transmission control protocol ( _ tcp _ ) that is used in internet congestion control .",
    "a fundamental building block of tcp is the additive increase multiplicative decrease ( _ aimd _ ) algorithm . to discuss aimd in a formal setting some preliminaries are necessary .      the vector space of real column vectors with @xmath0 entries is denoted by @xmath36 with elements @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the transpose of @xmath39 .",
    "the positive orthant @xmath40 is the set of vectors in @xmath36 with non - negative coordinates . for @xmath41 ,",
    "we write @xmath42 if @xmath43 for all @xmath2 .",
    "the space of @xmath44 matrices is denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the set of non - negative matrices , i.e. the set of matrices in which all entries are non - negative .",
    "the convex hull of a set @xmath47 is denoted by @xmath48 ; it may be defined as the smallest convex set containing @xmath47 .",
    "we denote the canonical basis vectors in @xmath36 by @xmath49 and let @xmath50 .",
    "the standard @xmath51-norm is defined by @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the closed ball of radius @xmath54 around @xmath55 with respect to this norm is denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "the distance of a point @xmath39 to a nonempty set @xmath57 with respect to the @xmath51-norm is then @xmath58    the standard simplex @xmath59 in @xmath36 is defined by @xmath60 we will write @xmath61 if we want to emphasize that we are working in @xmath36 . note that we are only interested in dynamics on @xmath59 .",
    "thus when we write @xmath56 we will tacitly assume that we consider the intersection of this ball with @xmath59 .",
    "the relative interior of @xmath59 is defined by @xmath62 .",
    "it will be sometimes useful to use the hilbert metric @xmath63 on @xmath64 , @xcite . recall that it is given by @xmath65 and makes @xmath66 a complete metric space .",
    "a ball of radius @xmath54 with respect to the hilbert metric is denoted by @xmath67 ; again without further notice , we will understand that @xmath67 is the ball contained in @xmath59 .",
    "for the sake of analysis , it is sometimes easier to work with the logarithm removed , in which case we consider @xmath68 note that for @xmath69 we have @xmath70 if and only if @xmath71 which is in turn equivalent to @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath73 if and only if @xmath74 .",
    "+      we have already mentioned that the aimd algorithm underpins tcp .",
    "we shall not describe the tcp algorithm here .",
    "rather , we refer the interested reader to @xcite for details of tcp .",
    "the dynamics of networks of aimd flows can be described as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a non - negative column stochastic matrix and @xmath24 enumerates the capacity events .",
    "the matrices @xmath76 belong to a finite set of matrices @xmath77 , which we now describe . given two vectors @xmath78",

    "such matrix sets and the dynamics of markov chains on @xmath59 defined by @xmath79 have been studied in @xcite .",

    "in particular , @xmath90 is a simple eigenvalue of @xmath89 and it is larger in magnitude than all the other eigenvalues of @xmath89 by the perron - frobenius theorem .",

    "indeed , as no information is required on the number of agents , these may join or drop out of the network at any time and the network will automatically readjust the kkt point given the new set of agents .",
    "in this section we discuss two versions of the stochastic algorithm for the approximation of the kkt point @xmath169 .",
    "the common feature of these algorithms is that the probabilities for backing off depend on an average of past states . in the first version",

    "our work lies in the intersection of two subjects : resource allocation and limiting characteristics of the stochastic version of the aimd algorithm @xcite .",
    "the aimd literature is huge and it is not straightforward to discuss the available results in any sort of compact manner here .",
    "we refer interested readers to some recent works on this topic in the context of tcp and internet congestion control @xcite .",
    "much of this work is based on fluid approximations of aimd dynamics ; the notable exceptions are @xcite .",
    "the latter of these papers make use of tools from iterated function systems to deduce the existence of such a unique probability distribution for standard linear aimd networks ( of which tcp is an example ) under an assumption on the underlying probability model ( albeit under very restrictive assumptions ) . to the best of our knowledge , this paper , along with the companion paper @xcite , established for the first time , the stochastic convergence of aimd networks .",
    "however , the window of infinite length considered in this paper goes well beyond the set - up in these papers .",
    "in particular , the result presented in this paper may be considered as the limiting case of the results presented in these papers .",
    "the literature on resource allocation is also immense and a full review is impossible here .",
    "here , we briefly note that the subject of resource allocation or social welfare optimization has been studied in three prominent settings : centralized , distributed concerted , and distributed competitive .",
    "+ in the first setting , there is a single decision - maker , who knows the utility function @xmath170 of every agent , solves the network optimization problem , and assign the optimal allocation to each agent .",
    "+ in the second setting , every resource user is a decision - maker that determines its own allocation according to a _ fixed _ policy ( e.g. , aimd algorithm in the case of tcp ) , that is prescribed by a system operator and remains unchanged over time .",
    "when all agents follow fixed policies prescribed by the system operator , a number of distributed optimization algorithms have been proposed to iteratively converge to an optimal allocation of resources for numerous settings @xcite .",
    "some of these algorithms are based on achieving consensus @xcite , others are based on distributed averaging @xcite , and on stochastic approximation @xcite .",
    "all these algorithms rely on communication between agents to achieve optimality .",
    "for example , when agents are assigned to nodes in a graph and restricted to communicate only with neighbors in that graph , the distributed dual averaging algorithm has been shown to guarantee the convergence of each agent s allocation to the optimal allocation over iterations of the algorithm @xcite .",
    "our work also considers a distributed setting with fixed - policy agents , but contains an important difference : the agents do not communicate among themselves , but are limited to an intermittent feedback signal from the network . specifically , they only observe at each iteration whether the allocation is feasible ( i.e. , the capacity constraint is satisfied ) .",
    "another difference of our work is that our results do not depend on the existing convergence results from stochastic approximation , and hence hold under different conditions . in particular",
    ", we can not apply the standard convergence argument for stochastic approximation because there are two time - scales ( cf .",
    "* chapters  6.2 and 10.4 ) ) .    in a third setting ,",
    "every resource user is a decision - maker that acts strategically so as to optimize its utility function with regards to the actions of all agents .",
    "when all agents act strategically , solution concepts such as nash equilibria are more meaningful than optimality concepts .",
    "in such a setting , a market mechanism based on bids has been proposed @xcite and shown to be efficient in equilibrium under some assumptions @xcite .",
    "in this situation the equilibrium allocation is also the solution to an optimization problem .",
    "these works do not however provide a method for the agents to arrive at an equilibrium allocation .",
    "in contrast , our work may not consider strategic agents , but does present a set of policies that guarantee the convergence to an optimal allocation .",
    "the link between congestion control ( which encompasses the aimd algorithm ) and optimization has been noted by several authors @xcite . that various embodiments of tcp solve a network utility maximization problem is a cornerstone of much of the tcp literature @xcite .",
    "however , we are dealing with the converse problem : given an num problem , is there an aimd algorithm that solves it ?",
    "perhaps , the most closely related works in this direction are given in the following references : @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , these references follow two lines of direction . in the first direction ,",
    "fluid - like approximations of congestion control are modified to address the num problem .",
    "this yields a sub - gradient like algorithm for solving the num problem . in the second direction ,",
    "synchronized aimd like algorithms are proposed to solve certain num problems using nonlinear back - off rules and nonlinear increase rules @xcite .",
    "the work presented here goes far beyond these works .",
    "first , we consider the matrix model of tcp proposed in @xcite as opposed to a fluid model .",
    "fluid approximations are valid only for very large numbers of agents , and the dynamic interaction between agents is often overlooked .",
    "the matrix model is an exact representation of aimd dynamics under certain assumptions and can readily be implemented in existing software stacks .",
    "furthermore , these models are often analyzed using linearized approximations in contrast to our approach in which global stability ( ergodicity ) is proved .",
    "a further difference is that each agent responds to a capacity event according to its own probability function , known only to that agent . in this sense",
    "our proposed algorithms go beyond traditional aimd and emulate red - like congestion control @xcite .",
    "second , we assume very limited actuation ; an agent only decides to respond to a capacity event or not in an asynchronous manner .",
    "there is no need for a common clock and the setting is completely stochastic . in this context",
    "our results prove convergence and stability of the stochastic aimd system and establish its suitability for solving large scale num problems .",
    "we now illustrate the application of our results . to this end consider a total of @xmath330 agents participating in the optimization .",
    "each agent @xmath22 has a cost function @xmath170 assigned which maps its share of the resource capacity @xmath205 to an associated cost .",
    "the cost functions are chosen from the set of polynomials taking the following forms @xmath331 the parameters @xmath332,@xmath333 , and @xmath334 are the cost - factors of each function and are positive .",

    "the objective is then @xmath335 for the simulations we choose the resource capacity to be equal to one , i.e. @xmath227 .",

    "future work will consider the behavior of finite window averaging systems and elaborate on the preliminary results obtained in this paper .",

    "we now briefly explain the structure of the proof of the main result , as otherwise the reader may sometimes wonder why we need certain intermediate results .",
