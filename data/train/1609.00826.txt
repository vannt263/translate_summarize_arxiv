    "wormholes are handles or tunnels in spacetime connecting different regions of our universe or different universes altogether . that wormholes could be actual physical structures suitable for interstellar travel was first proposed by morris and thorne @xcite",
    ". such wormholes can be described by the static and spherically symmetric line element @xmath0 using units in which @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is called the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to avoid an event horizon .",
    "the function @xmath3 is called the _",
    "shape function _ since it determines the spatial shape of the wormhole when viewed , for example , in an embedding diagram @xcite . the spherical surface @xmath4 is the _ throat _ of the wormhole .",
    "here @xmath5 must satisfy the following conditions : @xmath6 , @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , usually called the _ flare - out condition_. for morris - thorne wormholes , this condition can only be satisfied by violating the null energy condition , requiring the use of  exotic matter . \"",
    "since @xmath10 is proportional to the density in the einstein field equations , we ordinarily require that @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of conformal symmetry on wormholes that have an electric charge .",
    "more precisely , we assume the existence of a conformal killing vector @xmath12 defined by the action of @xmath13 on the metric tensor : @xmath14 where @xmath13 is the lie derivative operator and @xmath15 is the conformal factor .",
    "charged wormholes were first proposed by kim and lee @xcite .",
    "compatibility of such wormholes with quantum field theory is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to studying its effect on a charged wormhole , we obtain a physical interpretation of the conformal factor in terms of the electric charge . the combination of electric charge and conformal symmetry results in a wormhole model that may actually have two throats .",
    "[ s : killing ] as noted in the introduction , we assume that our static spherically symmetric spacetime admits a one - parameter group of conformal motions , i.e. , motions along which the metric tensor remains invariant up to a scale factor .",
    "equivalently , there exist conformal killing vectors such that @xmath16 where the left - hand side is the lie derivative of the metric tensor and @xmath15 is the conformal factor @xcite .",
    "the vector @xmath12 generates the conformal symmetry and the metric tensor @xmath17 is conformally mapped into itself along @xmath12 . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , this type of symmetry has been used effectively to describe relativistic stellar - type objects , thereby leading to new solutions , as well as new geometric and kinematical insights @xcite .",
    "even more significantly , it has also been shown that the kerr black hole is conformally symmetric @xcite .",
    "two earlier studies assumed _ non - static _ conformal symmetry @xcite .    to study the effect of conformal symmetry ,",
    "it is convenient to use an alternate form of the metric @xcite : @xmath18 using this form , the einstein field equations become @xmath19    @xmath20    and    @xmath21 = 8\\pi p_t.\\ ] ]    to keep the analysis tractable , we follow herrera and ponce de len @xcite and restrict the vector field by requiring that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the four - velocity of the perfect fluid distribution , so that fluid flow lines are mapped conformally onto fluid flow lines .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry then implies that @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "( [ e : lie ] ) now yields the following results : @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 from eqs .",
    "( [ e : sol1 ] ) and ( [ e : sol2 ] ) , we then obtain @xmath28 which , combined with eq .",
    "( [ e : sol3 ] ) , produces the final result : @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are integration constants .",
    "the einstein field equations can be rewritten as follows : @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 it now becomes apparent that @xmath31 is merely a scale factor in eqs .",
    "( [ e : grr])-([e : e3 ] ) ; so we may assume that @xmath35 .",
    "the constant @xmath30 , on the other hand , will have to be obtained from the junction conditions , the need for which can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ e : gtt ] ) : since our wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat , the wormhole material must be cut off at some @xmath36 and joined to an exterior schwarzschild solution , @xmath37 so that @xmath38 , whence @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of the wormhole as seen by a distant observer .",
    "it was proposed by kim and lee @xcite that for a wormhole with constant charge @xmath41 the einstein field equations take on the form @xmath42.\\ ] ] given that the usual form is @xmath43 , the modified form in eq .",
    "( [ e : efe ] ) is obtained by adding the matter term @xmath44 to the right side and the corresponding back reaction term @xmath45 to the left side .",
    "the proposed metric is @xmath46 kim and lee go on to note that with @xmath47 , the wormhole becomes a reissner - nordstrm black hole , and if @xmath48 , the spacetime becomes a morris - thorne wormhole with a shape function @xmath3 that meets the usual requirements .",
    "it therefore became necessary to show that the metric , eq .",
    "( [ e : line4 ] ) , is a self - consistent solution of the einstein field equations .",
    "the shape function @xmath3 of the morris - thorne wormhole is now replaced by the effective shape function @xmath49 the effective shape function also has the usual properties , to be discussed later .",
    "in this section we return to the assumption of conformal symmetry mentioned in sec . [",
    "s : killing ] .",
    "let us first consider the kim - lee model , eq .",
    "( [ e : line4 ] ) . then by eq .",
    "( [ e : gtt ] ) , @xmath50 , we have , for all @xmath51 , @xmath52 which is impossible .",
    "so this model is not compatible with the assumption of conformal symmetry .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome , however , by introducing a new differentiable function @xmath53 to yield the line element @xmath54 evidently , @xmath55 by eq .",
    "( [ e : junction ] ) .",
    "since @xmath56 on the interval @xmath57 $ ] , it follows that @xmath58 , while @xmath59 .",
    "as already noted , given the effective shape function @xmath60 and the total matter @xmath61 the kim - lee model yields a self - consistent solution .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath53 has no effect on this conclusion .",
    "so our metric , eq .",
    "( [ e : line5 ] ) , is a valid solution of the einstein field equations representing a wormhole with an electric charge .",
    "the major objective in this section is to obtain a physical interpretation of the conformal factor @xmath62 , as well as the restrictions required to obtain a wormhole .",
    "first we recall that for some @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . also , for @xmath66 , @xmath7 . for the new ( effective ) shape function , @xmath60 , we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 to meet the flare - out condition .",
    "( this implies that @xmath69 . ) since @xmath3 is assumed to be a typical shape function , @xmath7 for @xmath66 , and @xmath70 for @xmath71 . since @xmath72 by eq .",
    "( [ e : beff1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath73 .",
    "( see fig . 1 . )     at @xmath4 remains near @xmath63.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    next , from eqs .",
    "( [ e : line2 ] ) , ( [ e : grr ] ) , and ( [ e : line5 ] ) ( and recalling that @xmath35 ) , @xmath74 since @xmath75 , it also follows that @xmath76 and @xmath77 the condition @xmath67 now implies that @xmath78 also , since @xmath64 , we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 so eqs . ( [ e : psi1 ] ) and ( [ e : psi2 ] ) give us a physical interpretation for the conformal factor @xmath15 in terms of the charge @xmath41 .",
    "additional connections to @xmath41 are given below .",
    "having just learned that @xmath81 increases to the right of @xmath4 , let us examine the slope of @xmath81 more closely .",
    "first note that from eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) we have @xmath82 from the inequality @xmath83 , we get @xmath84 solving , we obtain the inequality @xmath85    similarly , since @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 solving , we obtain the second inequality : @xmath89    our final task is to check the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) required to hold the wormhole open . recall that the nec states that given the stress - energy tensor @xmath90 , @xmath91 for all null vectors .",
    "so we obtain from the null vector @xmath92 that @xmath93 whenever the condition is violated . by ref .",
    "@xcite , this violation is equivalent to the condition @xmath94 ^ 2}<0\\ ] ] for a generic shape function . for @xmath95",
    ", we already know that the last inequality holds whenever @xmath96 by inequality ( [ e : ineq1 ] ) . by eq .",
    "( [ e : psishape ] ) , @xmath81 is associated with @xmath97 ; so we can use the field equations , eqs .",
    "( [ e : e1 ] ) and ( [ e : e2 ] ) , to determine @xmath98 since @xmath99 .",
    "near the throat @xmath4 , @xmath81 is rising , so that the nec is indeed violated at and near @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath63 , the throat of @xmath3 , we can not use eqs .",
    "( [ e : e1 ] ) and ( [ e : e2 ] ) , since the null vectors are not the same .",
    "moreover , we can infer from eq .",
    "( [ e : bprime ] ) that @xmath100 showing that @xmath81 can not keep increasing indefinitely .",
    "in fact , given that @xmath101 , @xmath81 could already be decreasing at @xmath63 .",
    "we therefore have to require that @xmath63 be close enough to @xmath4 so that @xmath102 ( since @xmath103 is small in geometrized units , @xmath104 is close to @xmath105 to begin with . ) as a result , if the nec is violated at @xmath4 , it is also violated at @xmath63 .",
    "in thia section we study the various conditions under which the nec is violated .",
    "so let us restate inequality ( [ e : ineq1 ] ) and the modified inequality ( [ e : ineq2 ] ) : @xmath106 and @xmath107 from @xmath108 we obtain the following half - open intervals : @xmath109 @xmath110 and @xmath111    we now observe that whenever @xmath112 is in interval i , the nec is violated at @xmath63 , but not at @xmath4 .",
    "( the reason is that @xmath113 now satisfies inequality ( [ e : second ] ) , but @xmath114 does not satisfy inequality ( [ e : first ] ) . )",
    "so only @xmath5 has a legitimate throat .",
    "if @xmath115 is in interval iii , the nec is violated at @xmath4 , but not at @xmath63 .",
    "( here @xmath114 satisfies inequality ( [ e : first ] ) , but @xmath113 does not satisfy inequality ( [ e : second ] ) . )",
    "so only @xmath95 has a legitimate throat .",
    "finally , if @xmath116 is in interval ii , the nec is violated at both @xmath105 and @xmath104 .",
    "so given the right conditions , our wormhole can have two throats .",
    "now recall that the event horizon of a black hole is often viewed as the analogue of the throat of the wormhole .",
    "in fact , according to hayward @xcite , if enough negative energy is injected into a black hole , it may become a traversable wormhole ; the event horizon becomes the throat . from this perspective",
    ", our wormhole can be viewed as the natural analogue of the kerr - newman black hole : this type of black hole also has two surfaces that are characterized by coordinate singularities .    _",
    "remark : _ the existence of two throats invites the following speculation : a variation on the kim - lee model is @xmath117 unlike our earlier model , this metric can lead to an event horizon .",
    "in particular , suppose @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "since inequalities ( [ e : first ] ) and ( [ e : second ] ) still hold , this model suggests that it is in principle possible to pass through the throat at @xmath63 and return via the throat at @xmath4 , not only bypassing the event horizon of the black hole , but allowing a return trip .",
    "this paper discusses the effect that conformal symmetry can have on a charged wormhole .",
    "conversely , the physical requirements are seen to place severe constraints on the wormhole geometry .",
    "the analysis yields a physical interpretation of the conformal factor @xmath15 in terms of the charge @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the outcome is heavily dependent on @xmath81 and @xmath115 and ranges from having no solution to wormholes having two throats .",
    "the latter case can be viewed as the analogue of the kerr - newman black hole .",
