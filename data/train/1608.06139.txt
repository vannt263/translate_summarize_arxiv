    "relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc provide a strong evidence that a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is produced in these experiments . with the increase in collision center of mass energy from rhic to lhc",
    ", a qgp state at higher temperature @xmath4 is expected to be formed at lhc @xcite . at this high temperature , it is important to study the non - trivial vacuum structure of qcd arising from z(3 ) center symmetry of qcd @xcite . in @xmath5",
    "pure gauge theory , the deconfined phase exists in three degenerate vacua corresponding to three different phases of z(3 ) center symmetry and nonzero value of the polyakov order parameter .",
    "z(3 ) center symmetry is restored below @xmath1 in the confined phase , while it is spontaneously broken in the deconfined phase .",
    "however for real qcd with dynamical quarks , z(3 ) center symmetry is explicitly broken in the deconfined phase giving rise to one true vacuum ( along @xmath6 = 0 ) and two metastable vacua @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the explicit symmetry breaking effect due to quarks is very small and a linear term in polyakov loop is added to polyakov loop potential to take into account of this effect @xcite .",
    "for these models , metastable states exist at any temperature greater than @xmath1 .",
    "however , lattice qcd result @xcite show that these metastable states do nt exist in the neighborhood of @xmath1 , but for temperatures @xmath7 mev .",
    "this leads to a strong explicit symmetry breaking rather small explicit symmetry breaking due to quarks .",
    "it has been studied that these z(3 ) domains give a microscopic explanation for large color opacity ( jet quenching ) and near perfect fluidity ( small value of @xmath8 ) nature of qgp @xcite .",
    "hence , this is very important to study these domains in the nonperturbative regime of qcd in which the system exists in a strongly interacting qgp phase just after collision of two heavy nuclei in relativistic heavy ion collision . due to the explicit symmetry effect of quarks",
    ", there are huge oscillations in the polyakov loop order parameter field which gives rise to large fluctuations in the flow anisotropies in the quenched transition to qgp @xcite .",
    "importance of z(3 ) walls has been discussed as non - trivial scattering of quarks from z(3 ) walls .",
    "its consequences for cosmology as well as for heavy ion collision have been explored @xcite , including the possibility of cp violating scattering of quarks from z(3 ) walls leading to interesting observational implications @xcite .",
    "these z(3 ) metastable states have been studied at high temperatures in presence of dynamical quarks @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the contribution of massless quarks to the one loop effective potential leads metastable states only at very high temperatures @xmath9 .",
    "there are no z(3 ) metastable states near @xmath1 since the vacuum energy density for the metastable states is greater than the energy density in the confined phase . since the calculation of the effective potential is perturbative",
    ", it is only valid at temperatures much larger than @xmath10 .",
    "we do nt expect it to be valid near @xmath1 .",
    "however , a detailed description of such metastable states near @xmath1 is difficult because of the non perturbative nature of qcd and incompleteness of the theory of thermodynamics of the nonequilibrium systems .",
    "therefore in the current work , we study these metastable states near @xmath1 using polyakov quark meson ( pqm ) model @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the two important aspects of qcd phase transition , chiral transition and confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the polyakov loop potential represents su(3 ) pure gauge theory part which respects z(3 ) center symmetry .",
    "the linear sigma model is included to represent the chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "the quarks are minimally coupled to a spatially constant temporal background gauge field @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the dynamical quark sector of qcd is included by integrating out the quark degrees of freedom in presence of mean fields .",
    "since , this model describes an interaction potential between quarks , mesons and polyakov loop , this is a very suitable model to study the metastable states near @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown that the sign of finite temperature correction to the effective potential depends on the sign of real part of the polyakov loop @xcite . in general",
    ", it gives a negative contribution to the energy density of the vacuum when the real part of polyakov loop is positive ( making it a global minimum along @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , it gives a positive contribution to the effective potential ( making it metastable ) when the real part of the polyakov loop is negative .",
    "this is also the case for pqm model .",
    "the polyakov loop potential respects z(3 ) symmetry and there are three degenerate vacua at any temperature greater than the critical temperature .",
    "however , when the interaction term between polyakov loop and quarks is included as given in pqm model , @xmath12 vacuum becomes true vacuum due to addition of a negative energy density since the real part of polyakov loop is positive .",
    "the other two z(3 ) vacua become metastable due to addition of a positive energy density since the real part of polyakov loop is negative . since",
    "the interaction part between the polyakov loop and quarks in pqm model also has chemical potential dependence , we study about these metastable states and their temperature and chemical potential dependence in great detail in this model . in this paper , we also have shown those polyakov loop potentials with large barrier between different z(3 ) vacuum , sustains z(3 ) metastability structure when the interaction term between quarks and polyakov loop is added .",
    "it is very important to study nonequilibrium effects since there are metastable states in this system .",
    "this has been already studied as a numerical simulation in @xcite where the phase transition from confined to deconfined phase is modeled by a quench to a very high temperature with in polyakov loop potential .",
    "the evolution of z(3 ) domains have been studied for different cases like small or large explicit symmetry breaking effect by putting a small or large term as the coefficient of linear term in the polyakov loop potential@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have shown domain growth for the polyakov loop and sigma order parameter in a quench scenario .",
    "the nonequilibrium effects have been studied by using langevin equations of motion @xcite using pqm model .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the essential aspects of the pqm model . here",
    ", we also discuss about the two different parametrisation used in the literature for polyakov loop potential in su(3 ) pure gauge theory .",
    "section iii describes about the metastable states at higher temperature and chemical potential .",
    "it is shown that the parametrisation for the pure gauge part which has larger barrier between different vacuua leads to existence of metastable states when quarks are coupled to it .",
    "we show that there is a large symmetry breaking effect due to quarks which leads to the existence of metastable states at higher temperature and a large shift ( @xmath3 ) in the phase of metastable vacua .",
    "we compare the explicit symmetry breaking of pqm model with small explicit symmetry breaking as a linear term in polyakov loop added to polyakov loop potential .",
    "iv discusses the numerical techniques for the simulation to describe phase transition via quench and the results of the simulation .",
    "section v presents conclusions .",
    "the thermal expectation value of the polyakov loop represents the order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the polyakov loop operator is a wilson loop in the temporal direction    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the temporal component of the gauge field @xmath15 , @xmath16 denotes path ordering in the euclidean time @xmath17 , and @xmath18 with t being the temperature . within polyakov gauge , the temporal component of the gauge field is time independent , so that @xmath19 .",
    "the normalised polyakov loop variable @xmath20 and its charge conjugate @xmath21 are defined as the color trace of the polyakov loop operator defined in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath22    here the trace is taken in the fundamental representation . @xmath20 and @xmath23 are complex scalar fields and their mean values are related to the free energy of infinite heavy , static quark or antiquark .",
    "the order parameter @xmath20 vanishes in the confined phase since infinite amount of free energy is required to put a static quark in that phase . however , the order parameter is finite in deconfined phase related to finite free energy of static quark .    under z(n )",
    "center symmetry of su(n ) gauge symmetry , the polyakov loop order parameter transforms as    @xmath24    for su(3 ) pure gauge theory , the effective potential of polyakov loop has been proposed with the parameters fitted to reproduce lattice results for pressure and energy density . here",
    ", we will discuss two kinds of parametrisation used in literature as discussed below .",
    "the parameter set 1 is taken from @xcite and the parameter set 2 is taken from @xcite .",
    "both the potential with the parameters given below represents a first order phase transition at the critical temperature @xmath25 . for",
    "the parameter set 1 , the effective polyakov potential is given by    @xmath26    the modulus of @xmath20 and @xmath23 are same for pure gauge theory .",
    "the cos 3@xmath6 term , coming from @xmath27 term from the effective potential above leads to z(3 ) degenerate vacua at a temperature greater than the critical temperature.the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 have been taken as , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the temperature dependent coefficient @xmath32    @xmath33    with the coefficients chosen as above , the expectation value of order parameter approaches to @xmath34 for temperature @xmath35 .",
    "we use the normalization such that the expectation value of order parameter @xmath20 goes to unity for temperature @xmath35 .",
    "hence the fields and the coefficients in the above potential are rescaled as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 to get proper normalization of @xmath20 .",
    "for the parameter set 2 , the effective polyakov potential is    @xmath40    here , the temperature independent coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath42 and temperature dependent coefficient @xmath32 is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the difference between these two parametrisation is that the barrier between z(3 ) vacua for parameter set 1 is very large compared to the parameter set 2 at any temperature greater than @xmath48 .",
    "fig.1 shows the barrier between different z(3 ) vacua at a temperature @xmath49 at the corresponding vacuum expectation value of polyakov potential . here",
    "the parameters are such that the vacuum expectation value of polyakov potential at t = 400 mev for parameter set 1 and set 2 are 0.92 and 0.81 respectively .",
    "the energy density is almost equal for different z(3 ) vacua for both cases ( difference arises only due to difference in the expectation values of polyakov loop ) .",
    "we can also see that z(3 ) interface profile will be different for the polyakov loop potential described by set 1 and set 2 .",
    "the z(3 ) interface arises as one goes from one z(3 ) vacuum to another z(3 ) vacuum .",
    "these interfaces have been well studied in su(3 ) lattice pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the interface solution for the polyakov loop potential as a time independent solution is given in @xcite . here",
    ", we also use the same energy minimization technique as used in @xcite to get the interface profile . to determine the interface profile one needs to consider the profile of polyakov loop in one dimension ( say along z ) .",
    "we fix the values of @xmath20 at the two boundaries of the one - dimensional lattice as the values of polyakov loop corresponding to two distinct minima ( two z(3 ) degenerate minima ) of the polyakov potential .",
    "field configuration is then fluctuated at each lattice point , while fixing the boundary points , and energy is minimized .",
    "the configuration with the lowest value of energy is accepted ( when the energy almost settles down to a definite value ) as the correct profile of the interface .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the details of the energy minimisation technique . for the polyakov loop potential with parameter set 1 ,",
    "the minimum energy configuration is such that the polyakov order parameter goes very close to @xmath50 , since there is huge barrier between different z(3 ) vacua .",
    "this is also seen in lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "however , for the potential with parameter set 2 , the barrier between different z(3 ) vacua is even smaller than the central bump near @xmath20=0 .",
    "so for the potential set 2 , the minimum energy configuration going from one vacuum to another vacuum never goes close to @xmath50 , rather it goes through a path where modulus of @xmath20 remains almost constant and @xmath6 continuously changing .",

    "we will also see later in the paper that including quark contribution to the polyakov loop potential washes away z(3 ) metastability structure for parameter set 2 .",
    "this is mainly because the barrier between different z(3 ) vacua is very small for this parameter set 2 . since the barrier between different z(3 ) vacua is very large for parameter set 1 , the quark effect does not wash away the z(3 ) metastability structure .",

    "generally , the metastability temperature should increase with increase in chemical potential since we are adding more dynamical quark degrees of freedom by increasing chemical potential , however , the cause for this sharp increase of metastability temperature beyond @xmath132 mev is not very clear .",
    "we expect that there must be drastic change in phase transition dynamics beyond this chemical potential .",
    "it has been already observed that the critical point exists at @xmath133=(150 mev,168 mev ) @xcite . when the chemical potential is less than the critical chemical potential , it is a crossover in qcd phase diagram . beyond critical chemical potential",
    ", there is a first order phase transition between confined and deconfined phase where the dynamics of the phase transition are very different than the crossover .",
    "so , the temperature dependence of metastable states at higher chemical potential tells about the phase transition dynamics and hints towards the existence of a critical point .",
    "these metastable states have a phase of @xmath134 as already seen for zero chemical potential .",
    "however , here we have assumed @xmath135 for finite chemical potential which is not a very good approximation .",

    "we use the framework of bjorken s boost invariant longitudinal expansion model @xcite for the central rapidity region in relativistic heavy ion collisions . to model the quench , we take the initial field configuration to constitute a small patch around @xmath137 which corresponds to confining vacuum near zero temperature .",
    "we take the initial phase of @xmath20 to vary randomly between 0 and @xmath138 from one lattice site to the other , while the magnitude of @xmath20 is taken to vary uniformly between 0 and @xmath139 .",

    "we choose a larger initial patch i.e",
    "@xmath139 = 0.1*vev for this potential , the field already sits on the top of the barrier along the metastable vacua near @xmath50 .",
    "then the field rolls down to all vacua , since the potential is more tilted towards the true vacuum , the larger fraction of region is occupied by domains of true vacuum inside as shown in fig.10 . here",
    ", we have shown the values of the phase of @xmath20 around the three z(3 ) vacua in terms of different colors ( shades ) to focus on the evolution of z(3 ) domain structure .",

    "z(3 ) domains become more well defined , and grow in size by coarsening as shown in sequence of figures in fig.10 .",
    "the boundaries of different z(3 ) domains represent z(3 ) walls , and the junction of three different z(3 ) domains give rise to the qgp strings .    here",
    ", we would like to mention that at temperature 400 mev as shown in fig.7 , the potential along the metastable vacuum has a small barrier between confined vacuum and metastable vacuum .",
    "so , there is a possibility of metastable domain formation via bubble nucleation .",
    "since the barrier height is much smaller than energy density difference between the confined and metastable vacua , these will be thick wall bubbles .",
    "but , there is no barrier between confined vacuum and true vacuum at this temperature and true vacuum domains are formed due to the roll down of the polyakov loop field .",

    "there are no metastable domain formation for this case .",
    "when the field always rolls down to true vacuum , it has been observed that large field oscillations lead to large fluctuations in the evolution of flow anisotropies in quench case compared to equilibrium transition case @xcite .",

    "we have observed that this metastability temperature remains almost constant upto finite chemical 170 mev , and it increases after this chemical potential .",
