    "relativistic ng bosons can be classified into two types , a and b. if we believe in the existence of the effective lagrangian for the ng bosons , they live in the coset space of the spontaneously broken symmetries , and type a ( b ) ng bosons have the second ( first ) order time derivative such that they are compatible with the coset structure .    in order to relate the classification to the intrinsic symmetry breaking pattern",

    "a ng bosons correspond to the situation in which @xmath4|0\\rangle=0 $ ] for any pairs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while type b ng bosons correspond to the situation in which @xmath4|0\\rangle\\neq0 $ ] for some pair of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . using the matrix @xmath9",
    "whose elements are defined as , the number of ng bosons is given by @xmath10 . here , the number of type a ng bosons is given by @xmath11 , and the number of type b ng bosons is given by @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the above mentioned coset structure determines the dispersion relations from the matrix @xmath9 .",
    "type a ( b ) ng bosons have linear ( quadratic ) dispersion , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are frequency and momentum , respectively .",
    "the classification is intuitive , but relies on the weakly coupled effective lagrangian description with the coset structure . in particular , it is not obvious if the argument directly applies to the spontaneous supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking .",
    "the original idea of susy is to combine bosons and fermions in the same representation .",
    "the susy generators @xmath0 and @xmath1 interchange bosonic and fermionic particles .",
    "it was first discovered in the study of the fermionic strings in two - dimension @xcite , and then generalized to four - dimensions by wess and zumino @xcite ( as well as in the earlier work by golfand and likhtman @xcite ) . in elementary particle physics",
    ", susy has been pursued for a possible solution of the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "the central idea is that the bose - fermi cancellation above the electro - weak energy scale will ameliorate the high energy fine - tuning of dimensionful parameters in the standard model of particle physics .    in reality , we have not observed susy in any particle physics experiment as of writing this paper .",
    "therefore , we believe that susy , if any , must be spontaneously broken .",
    "in relativistic field theory , spontaneous susy breaking also gives rise to massless fermions , which are called nambu - goldstone ( ng ) fermions or goldstinos @xcite .",
    "this is the susy version of the nambu - goldstone theorem @xcite .",
    "studies on the relationship between ng fermions and spontaneous susy breaking have a long history especially in relativistic cases . indeed , before the seminal paper by wess and zumino , akulov and volkov @xcite proposed the model of susy only with fermions , which may be regarded as the action of the ng fermions .",
    "on the other hand , less is known about the relation between spontaneous susy breaking and ng fermions in lattice and/or non - relativistic systems . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "susy is discussed in cold - atom systems , topological insulators , and lattice systems @xcite .",
    "examples of the lattice models with susy include nicolai s model @xcite and a class of models introduced by fendley _",
    "these models are special in that their ground - state degeneracy tends to grow exponentially with system size . in the cold - atom context , a possible realization of susy in bose - fermi mixtures has been theoretically introduced by yu and yang @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system commutes with the fermionic supercharge @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) that turns a fermion ( boson ) into a boson ( fermion ) .",
    "the system exhibits spontaneous susy breaking , i.e. , @xmath17 in the ground state @xmath18 unless the number of particles is zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion relation of ng fermions in this model is quadratic and can be thought of as type b in the classification scheme by ignoring the difference between commutator and anti - commutator @xcite .",
    "this means that the model satisfies the counting rule for ng bosons despite that the excitation is a fermion .",
    "here , a natural question arises : can we always apply the counting rule of ng bosons to spontaneous susy breaking naively ?",
    "the answer to this question is  no \" because there is a model that may be regarded as an exception of a naive generalization of the counting rules .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to show such an example and to understand the nature of ng fermions induced by the spontaneous susy breaking there .",
    "more precisely , we introduce the extended version of the nicolai model , a lattice model with susy in one spatial dimension and analyze the vacuum structure and the low energy excitations .",
    "we show that susy is broken spontaneously in this model and the low energy effective field theory is described by a massless dirac fermion ( or thirring fermion more generally ) . in our model , the structure of the vacuum expectation value of broken susy generators looks like that of type b ng bosons , i.e. , but we find that the dispersion is linear @xmath19 which is supposed to be the dispersion of type a. this suggests that a naive generalization of the counting rules for ng bosons does not apply to the present case",

    "the above argument does not exclude the possibility that susy is restored in the infinite - volume limit , because the ground - state energy per site might become zero .",
    "however , for sufficiently large @xmath2 this is not the case . to prove this , we use anderson s argument  @xcite",
    "with which we can obtain a lower bound for the ground - state energy .",

    "in particular , for the counting of ng fermions , our model provides an example in which assumptions implicitly made in the argument in the literature ( for non - relativistic ng bosons ) must be carefully reconsidered ( see appendix [ sec : nakayama ] ) .",
    "they include the assumption on the analytic dependence of the broken susy generators on the momentum , decoupling of the ng fermions from the other gapless degrees of freedom and possibilities of strong couplings among ng modes . from the rg analysis and the constraint on the spectral functions , we know that relativistic ng modes ( both bosonic and fermionic ) can not interact strongly at low energy in two or more space dimensions , but in non - relativistic systems , in particular in @xmath174 dimensions , gapless fermions may admit nontrivial marginal or relevant interactions . in our case , the tl parameter may be an example of such deformations . to understand the possibility of strong interactions of ng fermions ( or bosons more generally without lorentz invariance ) , it is important to precisely determine the tl parameter for the ng fermions in our model .    while our rg analysis is essentially @xmath175 expansions around the free dirac fermions at @xmath176 , it is interesting to see if we can set up the small @xmath2 expansions around the original nicolai model at @xmath34 .",

    "this is the minimal prediction of the ng fermion theorem without lorentz symmetry .    strictly speaking",
    ", the above argument does not exclude the possibility that a non - dispersive isolated contribution from a vacuum degeneracy will satisfy without gapless modes .",
    "if this were the case , the lhs of would contain a space - time independent constant @xmath150 .",
    "however , we may argue that the equal - time anti - commutators of fermionic operators should vanish sufficiently fast in space separation in local field theories , so this possibility is inconsistent with locality .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "naively , one may repeat the argument by nielsen and chadha @xcite to discuss counting of ng fermions .",
    "we , however , point out a couple of subtleties .",
    "first of all , in nielsen - chadha , the linear ( in)dependency of the broken ( super)charge plays a significant role . here , for the _ susy on a finite lattice _ , we may always choose @xmath260 while @xmath261 as a definition of the susy breaking ground state .",
    "( if @xmath262 but @xmath263 , then define @xmath264 . ) for the moment , suppose this were the case even in the continuum limit .",
    "then consider the fourier transform of @xmath265 now @xmath261 means that the second term of the rhs vanishes in the @xmath266 limit .",
    "nielsen and chadha argued that the lhs must be an analytic function of the momentum , and for this to be the case , the dispersion relation must be an even function @xmath267 .",
    "indeed , this is the mechanism how we would have type b ng bosons .",
    "however , we have explicitly seen in the main text that the dispersion relation of our ng fermions is linear , so this argument can not hold .",
    "if we notice that the low energy excitation of our ng fermion in the continuum limit is a massless dirac fermion ( or weakly coupled thirring fermion ) in the large-@xmath2 limit , we can immediately realize what went wrong .",
    "the assumption @xmath260 and @xmath261 is an ambiguous statement in the field theory limit .",
    "suppose we define @xmath268 , then the dirac sea prescription gives @xmath269 , @xmath270 but @xmath271 , @xmath272 since the definition of creation and annihilation flips across @xmath273 ( or at the fermi surface in the lattice model ) .",
    "once we take this careful limiting procedure , we notice that the fourier transform is analytic with the linear dispersion @xmath274 because the two non - analytic effects cancel .",
    "thus , our ng fermion violates an implicit assumption of nielsen - chadha that the ( in)dependency of the broken generator is analytic near @xmath273 , and eventually it shows the linear dispersion .",
    "we emphasize that this is always the case for the relativistic ng fermions .",
    "there is a further issue in counting the number of ng fermions . even after relaxing the connection between the linear dispersion relations and the linear ( in)dependency of the broken generators ,",
    "ng fermions in our example still seem to violate the counting rule of nielsen - chadha ( or more recent ones discussed in the introduction ) for another reason .",
    "the point is that our ng fermion is equivalent to a massless dirac fermion ( or thirring fermion ) , and we see that the number of gapless fermionic degrees of freedom is _ twice _ of the number of susy that is spontaneously broken . in other words , with the same susy algebra and the same susy breaking , one can construct a model in which the number of gapless fermionic degrees of freedom is half of our case ( i.e. majorana ) .",
    "we will discuss such models in a future publication  @xcite .    within our model ,",
    "the reason why we have doubled the number of gapless fermions is because the state that is created by the ng fermion operator @xmath275 discussed above shows the kinetic mixing with another gapless fermionic operator . in our lattice model ,",
    "this is provided by the fermion @xmath276 living in the even site while the ng fermion operator @xmath277 sits at the odd site , and they form a dirac pair in the large-@xmath2 limit .",
    "this violates a hidden assumption in the effective field theory argument in murayama - watanabe @xcite that the ng modes do not couple with other gapless modes .",
    "however , in general there is no guarantee this is the case , and we have a concrete counterexample here .",
