    "the 1 gev energy region is a particularly challenging domain . on one side ,",
    "it is far below from the perturbative qcd regime and , on the other , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is not expected to make reliable predictions at these energy values where resonance effects are known to be present . among the latter , those proceeding by the exchange of the scalar resonances @xmath10(980 ) and @xmath1(980 ) should dominate their respective channels .",
    "the controversial nature of these resonances @xcite and the poor knowledge of their properties @xcite adds then further complexity ( and interest ) to this 1 gev energy region . indeed , several proposals have been suggested along the years concerning the constitution of these scalars as complex @xmath11 states @xcite , @xmath12 molecules @xcite or ordinary @xmath13 mesons @xcite .",
    "the novosibirsk cmd-2 and snd collaborations have reported very recently , among others , the branching ratio and the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath0 decay . for the branching ratio , the cmd-2 collaboration reports @xmath14 @xcite , while the snd result is , consistently , @xmath15 @xcite . the observed invariant mass distribution shows a significant enhancement at large @xmath2 invariant mass that , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , could be interpreted as a manifestation of a sizeable contribution of the @xmath16 intermediate state .",
    "this and other radiative @xmath17 decays are also expected to be intensively investigated at the frascati @xmath17-factory da@xmath18ne @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the @xmath19 decays have been considered by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the intermediate vector meson contributions to @xmath0 lead to a small @xmath20 @xcite , whereas a chiral loop model closely linked to standard chpt predicts @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the scalar resonance effects and , in particular , the resonance pole associated to the @xmath1(980 ) were not contemplated in these two approaches .",
    "the recent experimental data from novosibirsk for both the branching ratio and the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum showing an enhancement around the @xmath1(980 ) mass seem therefore to disfavour these predictions based on vector meson exchange and/or a simple extrapolation of chpt ideas .    if we rely on the resonance picture , it is clear that the @xmath22 scalar meson lying just below the @xmath17 mass and having the appropriate quantum numbers should play an important rle in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "several theoretical attempts to describe the effects of scalars in @xmath17 radiative decays have appeared so far . among others",
    ", we would like to refer to the  no structure \" model @xcite , to the @xmath23 model @xcite , where the @xmath24 amplitude is generated through a loop of charged kaons , and to the chiral unitary approach @xmath25 @xcite , where the decay @xmath0 occurs through a loop of charged kaons that subsequently annihilate into @xmath26 .",
    "in the two former cases the scalar resonances are included _",
    "ad hoc _ while in the latter they are generated dynamically by unitarizing the one - loop amplitudes .    in this letter",
    ", we are mainly interested in incorporating scalar resonances and their pole effects into a chpt inspired context @xcite .",
    "while vector and axial - vector resonances can be included in a transparent and successful way , offering some theoretical basis to conventional vector meson dominance ( vmd ) ideas @xcite , the incorporation of scalar resonances has been more ambiguous and less successful up to now @xcite . in order to take explicitly into account scalar resonances and their pole effects",
    ", we propose to use the linear sigma model ( l@xmath27 m )",
    ". this will allow us to take advantage of the common origin of chpt and the l@xmath27 m to improve the chiral loop predictions for @xmath28 exploiting the complementarity of both approaches for these specific processes .",
    "on one side , chpt is the established theory of the pseudoscalar interactions at low energy .",
    "however , it is not reliable at energies of a typical vector meson mass and , as just stated , scalar resonance poles are not explicitly included . as a consequence , chpt inspired loop models can give rough estimates for @xmath29 but will hardly be able to reproduce the observed enhancements in the invariant mass spectra . on the other side ,",
    "the l@xmath27 m is a much simpler model dealing similarly with pseudoscalar interactions but incorporating _ scalar _ resonances in a systematic and definite way .",
    "thanks to this , the l@xmath27 m should be able to reproduce the resonance peaks in the spectra and , although it does not provide a systematical framework for the pseudoscalar meson physics , this model could be of relevance in describing the scalar resonances when linked to a well established chpt context .",
    "in order to show in detail the proposed framework , we will focus our attention on the @xmath0 decay mode .",
    "other decay modes are somewhat more involved and will be analyzed in forthcoming work .",
    "the vector meson initiated @xmath28 decays can not be treated in strict chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "this theory has to be extended to incorporate on - shell vector meson fields . at lowest order ,",
    "this may be easily achieved by means of the @xmath30 chpt lagrangian : @xmath31 where @xmath32 mev at this order , @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the usual pseudoscalar nonet matrix , and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the covariant derivative , now enlarged to include vector mesons , is defined as @xmath37 - i g [ v_\\mu , u]$ ] , with @xmath38 being the quark charge matrix and @xmath39 the additional matrix containing the nonet of ideally mixed vector meson fields .",

    "recently , the model has been resurrected as a framework to study the implications of chiral symmetry for the controversial scalar sector of qcd , and some variations of the basic l@xmath27 m lagrangian have shown to be phenomenologically rather successful @xcite .    in this context , the @xmath28 decays proceed through a loop of charged pseudoscalar mesons emitted by the initial vector . due to the additional emission of a photon ,",
    "these charged pseudoscalar pairs with the initial @xmath67 quantum numbers can rescatter into @xmath68 pairs of charged or neutral pseudoscalars .",
    "the scalar resonances are expected to play an essential rle in this rescattering process and the l@xmath27 m seems mostly appropriate to fix the corresponding amplitudes .",
    "several simplifications happen when one considers the @xmath0 decay mode .",
    "as in the analysis of sect .  [ sectchpt ] , contributions from charged pions in the loops are highly suppressed because they involve the isospin violating and ozi  rule forbidden @xmath69 coupling ; hence , the dominant contributions arise exclusively from loops of charged kaons .",
    "the subsequent rescattering of these charged kaon pairs into the final @xmath68 @xmath2 state is then quite simple .",
    "indeed , the l@xmath27 m amplitude for @xmath70 contains a contact term , a term with an @xmath1 exchanged in the @xmath71-channel and two terms with a @xmath72 ( _ i.e .  _ the strange @xmath73 scalar resonance ) exchanged in the @xmath74- and @xmath75-channels .",
    "however , the latter @xmath72-exchange contributions are absent for an @xmath59-@xmath60 mixing angle @xmath63 since the @xmath76 coupling constant appearing in one of the @xmath72 vertices vanishes .",
    "the calculation is then reduced to the diagrams shown in fig .",

    "their effects seem to be small ( see below ) for the present and expected levels of experimental accuracy and for this kind of processes governed by poorly known scalar resonances .",
    "more importantly , the absence of @xmath72 contributions makes our predictions more definite and solid since we avoid one of the major uncertainties affecting the scalar nonet dynamics , namely , the mass of its strange members .",
