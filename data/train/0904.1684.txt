    "convection in the form of slightly modified inertial waves is a well known phenomenon in geophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "the analysis of the onset of convection in a horizontal fluid layer heated from below and rotating about a vertical axis was first done by chandrasekhar more than 50 years ago . for an account of this early work",
    "we refer to his famous monograph ( chandrasekhar , 1961 ) .",
    "he found that convection sets in at high rotation rates in the form of modified inertial waves when the prandtl number is less than about 0.6 depending on the boundary conditions .",
    "another important case in which convection in the form of modified inertial waves occurs is the rotating fluid sphere heated from within and subject to a spherically symmetric gravity field .",
    "the transition from convection in the form of columns aligned with the axis of rotation to inertial convection in the form of equatorially attached modes has been demonstrated by @xcite . in a later series of papers",
    "zhang ( 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) developed an analytical theory for the critical parameter values for the onset of convection based on a perturbation approach .",
    "the buoyancy term and viscous dissipation are introduced in the equation of motion as small perturbations of inviscid inertial waves and the balance of the two terms is the used for the determination of the critical value of the rayleigh number . in this paper",
    "we extend this approach to case of a spherical boundary of low thermal conductivity on the one hand and to an alternate method of analysis on the other hand which will allow us to obtain explicit expressions for the dependence of the rayleigh number on the azimuthal wave number .",
    "we consider a homogeneously heated , self - gravitating fluid sphere rotating with the constant angular velocity @xmath0 about an axis fixed in space .",
    "a static state thus exists with the temperature distribution @xmath1 and the gravity field given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the position vector with respect to the center of the sphere and @xmath4 is its length measured in fractions of the radius @xmath5 of the sphere .",
    "in addition to the length @xmath5 , the time @xmath6 and the temperature @xmath7 are used as scales for the dimensionless description of the problem where @xmath8 denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath9 is its thermal diffusivity .",
    "the density is assumed to be constant except in the gravity term where its temperature dependence given by @xmath10 const .",
    "is taken into account .",
    "the basic equations of motion and the heat equation for the deviation @xmath11 from the static temperature distribution are thus given by    [ 100 ] @xmath12    where the rayleigh number @xmath13 , the coriolis parameter @xmath14 and the prandtl number @xmath15 are defined by @xmath16 we have neglected the nonlinear terms @xmath17 and @xmath18 in equations since we restrict the attention to the problem of the onset of convection in the form of small disturbances",
    ". in the limit of high @xmath14 the right hand side of equation can be neglected and the equation for inertial waves is obtained . for the description of inertial wave solutions @xmath19 we use the general representation in terms of poloidal and toroidal components for the solenoidal field @xmath19 , @xmath20 by multiplying the ( curl)@xmath21 and the curl of the inertial wave equation by @xmath3 we obtain two equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,    [ 130 ] @xmath24 \\nabla^2 v - \\tau { \\cal q } w =   0 , \\\\ \\label{132 } & [ \\partial_t { \\cal l}_2 - \\tau \\partial_{\\varphi } ] w + \\tau { \\cal q}v= 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the partial derivatives with respect to time @xmath27 and with respect to the angle @xmath28 of a spherical system of coordinates @xmath29 and where the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 are defined by    [ 140 ] @xmath32    general solutions in explicit form for inertial waves in rotating spheres have recently been obtained by @xcite . here only solutions of equations for which @xmath22 is symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane and does not possess a zero in its @xmath33-dependence are of interest since only those are connected with the preferred modes for onset of convection ( zhang , 1994 ) .",
    "these modes are given by @xmath34 with    [ 160 ] @xmath35    before considering the full problem we have to specify the boundary conditions .",
    "we shall assume a stress - free boundary with either a fixed temperature ( case a ) or a thermally insulating boundary ( case b ) , @xmath36    following @xcite we use a perturbation approach for solving equations , @xmath37 the perturbation @xmath38 consists of two parts , @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the perturbation of the interior flow , while @xmath41 is the ekman boundary flow which is required since @xmath19 satisfies the first of conditions , but not the second one .",
    "after the ansatz has been inserted into equations and we obtain the solvability condition for the equation for @xmath38 by multiplying it with @xmath42 and averaging it over the fluid sphere , @xmath43 where the brackets @xmath44 indicate the average over the fluid sphere and the @xmath45 indicates the complex conjugate .",
    "the evaluation of the second term on the right hand side of yields @xmath46d^2s,\\ ] ] since @xmath47 vanishes ( zhang , 1994 ) .",
    "since @xmath41 is of the order @xmath48 and vanishes outside a boundary layer of thickness @xmath48 only the term involving a radial derivative of @xmath41 makes a contribution of the order one on the right hand side of equation . this term can easily be evaluated because of the condition @xmath49 at the surface of the sphere .",
    "using expressions and we thus obtain @xmath50   \\nonumber \\\\ \\hspace*{3.2cm}\\cdot \\left|\\frac{2(m+1)^2 - 2}{(2m+1)(\\omega_0(m+1)(m+2)-m)}\\right|^2 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the relationship @xmath51 has been used .",
    "the equation for @xmath11 can most easily be solved in the limit of vanishing @xmath53 . in this limit",
    "we obtain for @xmath11 , @xmath54 with @xmath55 where the coefficient @xmath56 is given by @xmath57   \\displaystyle\\frac{(m+4)/m}{(m+5)(m+4)-(m+1)m } - \\displaystyle\\frac{(m+2)/m}{(m+3)(m+2)-(m+1)m }   & \\text{case b. } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] since @xmath11 is real @xmath58 must vanish according to the solvability condition and we obtain for @xmath13 the final result @xmath59 ^ 2 } + 2m+1\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{270 } \\hspace*{4 cm } \\cdot ( 2m+9)(2m+7)(2m+5)^2(2m+3)^2/b,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the two possibilities of the sign originate from the two possibilities of the sign in the expression for @xmath60 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath61 assumes the values @xmath62   ( m+1)(14m^2 + 59m+63 )   & \\text{case b. } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] obviously the lowest value of @xmath13 is reached for @xmath63 and the value @xmath64 for convection waves traveling in the retrograde direction is always lower than the value @xmath65 for the prograde waves .",
    "expression is also of interest , however , in the case of spherical fluid shells when the ( @xmath63)-mode is affected most strongly by the presence of the inner boundary . convection modes corresponding to higher values of @xmath66",
    "may then become preferred at onset since their @xmath4-dependence decays more rapidly with distance from the outer boundary according to relationships .",
    "for the solution of equation in the general case it is convenient to use the green s function method .",

    "expressions can now be used to calculate @xmath13 and @xmath58 on the basis of equation . in the case",
    "@xmath63 we obtain @xmath77^{-1 }   & \\text{case a , } \\\\ [ 10pt ]   \\left [ 9 + 525\\mu^{-4}-\\re \\left\\{\\displaystyle\\frac{(7\\mu^2 - 70 + 175\\mu^{-2 } ) \\sin\\mu}{2\\mu \\cos\\mu+(\\mu^2 - 2 ) \\sin\\mu}\\right\\}\\right]^{-1 } & \\text{case b , } \\\\ \\end{cases } \\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 indicates the real part of the term enclosed by @xmath79 .",
    "expressions have been plotted together with the expressions obtained for higher values of @xmath66 in figures [ f1]a and [ f1]b for the cases a and b , respectively .",
    "we also show numerical values by broken lines which have been obtained through the use of a modified version of the galerkin method of @xcite . because the numerical computations have been done for the finite value @xmath80 of @xmath14 the results differ slightly from those of the analytical theory .",
    "since there are two values of @xmath60 for each @xmath66 , two functions @xmath81 have been plotted for each @xmath66 . for values @xmath82 of the order unity or lower ,",
    "expressions are well approached and the retrograde mode corresponding to the positive sign in yields always the lower value of @xmath13 .",
    "but it looses its preference to the prograde mode corresponding to the negative sign in as @xmath82 becomes of the order @xmath83 or larger depending on the particular value of @xmath66 .",
    "this transition can be understood on the basis of the increasing difference in phase between @xmath11 and @xmath84 with increasing @xmath82 .",
    "while the mode with the largest absolute value of @xmath60 is preferred as long as @xmath11 and @xmath84 are in phase , the mode with the minimum absolute value of @xmath85 becomes preferred as the phase difference increases since the latter is detrimental to the work done by the buoyancy force .",
    "the frequency perturbation @xmath58 usually makes only a small contribution to @xmath85 which tends to decrease the absolute value of @xmath85 .    for very large values of @xmath82",
    "the rayleigh number @xmath13 increases in proportion to @xmath86 for fixed @xmath66 . in spite of",
    "this strong increase @xmath11 remains of the order @xmath82 on the right hand side of equation .",
    "the perturbation approach thus continues to be valid for @xmath87 as long as @xmath88 can be assumed . for any fixed low prandtl number ,",
    "however , the onset of convection in the form of prograde inertial modes will be replaced with increasing @xmath14 at some point by the onset in the form of columnar convection because the latter obeys an approximate asymptotic relationship for @xmath13 of the form @xmath89 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this second transition depends on the value of @xmath15 and will occur at higher values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 for lower values of @xmath15 .",
    "there is little chance that inertial convection occurs in the earth s core , for instance , since @xmath15 is of the order @xmath90 while the usual estimate for @xmath14 is @xmath91 .",
    "since the curves @xmath92 intersect at values of the order @xmath93 of @xmath82 in figures [ f1]a and [ f1]b , a different way of plotting the results has been adopted in figure [ f2 ] . here the preferred value of @xmath66 has been indicated by a filled circle in the case of the prograde inertial mode .",
    "the results of figure [ f2]a agree well with those of figure 4 of zhang ( 1994 ) even though only an approximate method had been used for the determination of the rayleigh number .",
    "zhang neglected the @xmath94-mode and thus arrived at a different criterion for the preferred mode .",
    "his preferred values of @xmath66 are indicated by open circles in figure 2a .",
    "the @xmath94-mode could indeed be suppressed by the presence of an inner concentric spherical boundary .",
    "a rough estimate indicates that inertial convection with the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath66 will be affected significantly when the radius @xmath95 of the inner boundary exceeds a value of the order @xmath96 .",
    "unfortunately an analytical theory of inertial waves in rotating spherical fluid shells does not exist and it is thus not possible to extend the analysis of this paper to the case when an inner boundary is present . for a numerical study of inertial convection in",
    "rotating spherical fluid shells and its finite amplitude properties we refer to the paper of @xcite .",
    "the two transitions between modes of different types mentioned in the preceding section illuminate some of the puzzling findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the transition labeled i in figure 17 of @xcite can now be clearly identified with the transition from retrograde to prograde inertial convection .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that this transition depends primarily on the parameter combination @xmath82 with only a minor dependence on the wavenumber @xmath66 .",
    "the second transition from inertial to columnar convection can not be pinned down as well because of the lack of a sufficiently accurate analytical theory for thermal rossby waves in the low prandtl number regime . according to the numerical results of @xcite ( see their figures 4 and 5 ) there exists a broad transition range involving perhaps several transitions where the onset of convection occurs in the form of multi - cellular modes .",
    "an illumination of this regime should be the goal of future research . + * acknowledgment : * the research reported in this paper has been performed in parts by the authors during their stay at the woods hole summer program in geophysical fluid dynamics 2002 .",
