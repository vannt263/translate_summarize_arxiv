    "we have approximated the stripe potentials as simple cosines ; deviations from this form were investigated and found not to be important.@xcite    these considerations lead to the following hamiltonian : @xmath36 we assume that the low temperature dc transport can be described by the boltzmann equation .",

    "in this section , we will consider the hall effect in the spin and/or charge stripe potentials .",
    "separate subsections treat different cases .",
    "we shall first consider the case where both potentials are weak , that is , the system is close to the quantum critical point from the normal state to the stripe ordered state .",
    "then , we consider the cases of spin stripe potential only and charge stripe potential only , and finally the effects of combined spin- and charge- stripe scattering . in this section , we shall fix the doping to be @xmath61 , where the stripe order is most stable , and study the hall effect , changing the strength of the stripe potentials @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in section [ results ] , we treat the doping dependence .      at small @xmath53 and/or @xmath54",

    "when @xmath53 grows large enough ( 0.25ev here ) , @xmath1 becomes negative .",
    "this reversal of sign comes from the elimination of the hole pockets ( fig .",

    "we found that the hall effect @xmath1 shows complicated behavior as the spin stripe potential @xmath53 and/or the charge stripe potential @xmath54 are varied .",
    "for moderate values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the behavior of @xmath1 can be understood as a result of the change of the fermi surface topology , which is quite sensitive to the tuning of the stripe order potentials . in the strong coupling limit",

    ", @xmath1 first increases from a positive band value @xmath116 , then decreases to negative values , and goes back to positive values , as increasing @xmath53 up to @xmath243ev , and then has a further sign change at unphysically large @xmath53 .",
    "this initial increase and the subsequent change of sign qualitatively agrees with the experimental data .",
    "this is further supported from the model calculation in which @xmath53 is assumed to increase when decreasing doping from @xmath12 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ [ rhplot ] ] .",
    "we mention that analogous calculations ( not shown here ) based on spiral order , do not produce a sign change . in a model with only static charge stripe potential @xmath54",
    ", our calculation shows that @xmath1 increases from the band value until a sign change at @xmath244ev , after which the sign assumes the strong coupling limit electron  like value .",
    "this is qualitatively inconsistent with experimental data .",
    "when both the static spin stripe potential and the charge stripe potential are present , @xmath1 can be strongly enhanced or can be made negative by tuning @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ [ vsvc ] ] .",
    "while both the spin stripe model and the @xmath53&@xmath54 model produce a sign change in @xmath1 , the mechanisms are different . in the spin stripe model ,",
    "the sign change of @xmath1 is due to the electron pocket centered at @xmath56 and the elimination of the hole pockets centered at @xmath117 . in the spin and charge stripe model ,",
    "the sign change is due to the merging of the hole pockets into open fermi surface and the appearance of the electron pocket centered at @xmath57 .",
    "measurements directly probing the fermi surfaces are required to distinguish these two scenarios . in our calculation",
    ", we found that the open fermi surface can give either a positive ( _ i.e. _ hole  like ) contribution or a negative ( _ i.e. _ electron  like ) contribution to @xmath58 . under certain situations ,",
    "especially when there is only open fermi surface , this contribution , albeit small , is important , since the small @xmath59 would compensate the smallness of @xmath58 to give a large @xmath79 ; the @xmath88ev , @xmath75 point in fig .",
    "[ [ changev](d ) ] and the @xmath78ev , @xmath245ev point in fig .",
    "[ [ vsvc](b ) ] are two examples .",
    "however , once there are electron or hole pockets , the contribution to @xmath58 from the open fermi surface is negligible , and thus the sign of @xmath1 is fixed .",
    "we also considered the large stripe potential limit , in which the system is quasi ",
    "one dimensional , and the fermi surface is open .",
    "we showed that analytical results of @xmath1 can be obtained in the limit @xmath121 , both for @xmath246 and for @xmath247 . in this limit , @xmath1 depends on the carrier density , the electron band parameters , and the charge potential @xmath54 , and its sign can be positive or negative",
    ".    there remain discrepancies between experiment and theory .",
    "experiment shows that @xmath1 at @xmath118 is about 4 times larger than that at @xmath12 , while our calculation only shows a factor of 2 .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath1 depends crucially on the details of the fermi surface .",
    "angle dependence of the scattering rate@xcite ( not considered here ) may also be important .",
    "a systematic study of the doping dependence of the low temperature hall effect , as was done on pcco,@xcite would be helpful .",
    "but , the crucial generic result of our calculation is that the sign change of @xmath1 observed in refs .",
