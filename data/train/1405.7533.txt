    "since their discovery in 1987 by durnin@xcite , bessel beams have been extensively studied due to their nominally non - diffracting behaviour and their ability to self - reconstruct after encountering an obstruction @xcite .",
    "these beams are characterized by a radial wave vector ( @xmath0 ) and azimuthal index ( @xmath1 ) , which results from their helical wave front structure . as a result",
    "bessel beams carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , even down to the single photon level@xcite .",
    "however an ideal bessel beam requires an infinite amount of energy ; this beam is practically approximated in a finite region by bessel gaussian ( bg ) beams@xcite .",
    "such beams have been generated using annular ring - slits in the far field@xcite , axicons in the near field@xcite , as well as the digital equivalent of both@xcite .",
    "these beams have been further explored by generating their superpositions@xcite , and converting them into vector bg beams@xcite .",
    "an emerging area of research is optical communication with the spatial modes of light , where bessel beams are also mooted to play a role , yet very little work has been done on the topic of two - dimensional detection of such modes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the detection of bessel beams by a simple scheme comprising only a helical axicon and a lens .",
    "we outline the concept , illustrate how it may be implemented optically and then demonstrate it with digitally encoded phase - only holograms .",
    "we apply the tool to the self - healing process of bessel beams after an obstruction as well as to bessel beams propagating through turbulence , and observe the changing radial and azimuthal spectrums for the first time .",
    "our results will be relevant to future studies in optical communication with bessel beams .",
    "such fields are interesting for communication purposes since they carry oam over extended distances in a nominally non - diffracting manner , and hence may be advantageous for signal delivery to distance receivers .",
    "the bessel - gaussian ( bg ) modes @xcite in polar coordinates , are given by @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the azimuthal index ( a signed integer ) , @xmath3 is the bessel function of order @xmath1 ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the radial and longitudinal wave numbers .",
    "the initial radius of the gaussian profile is @xmath6 and the rayleigh range is @xmath7 .",
    "the propagation constant @xmath8 and the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath5 are related by @xmath9 . while bg modes are nominally non - diffracting , they nevertheless have a finite propagation distance when generated in the laboratory , given by    @xmath10    bessel beams also exhibit reconstruction of the amplitude and phase of the beam after encountering an obstruction @xcite . for such beams",
    ", there is a minimum distance behind an obstacle of radius @xmath11 before reconstruction occurs .",
    "this distance represents the shadow region which is given by @xmath12    the bg modes form a complete orthonormal basis in terms of which an arbitrary paraxial laser beam may be expanded . in the case of bessel beams",
    "we note that there are two indices used to describe the field : the discrete parameter , @xmath1 , and the continuous parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the former determines the helicity of the wavefronts and is related to the oam content of the field , while the latter determines the spacing of the intensity rings observed in bessel beams .",
    "the task is to find the modal content of the field for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath13 , which we will show can be achieved with a simple optical set - up comprising a lens and a digital hologram encoded to represent an axicon . recall that a gaussian beam illuminating an axicon produces a bg beam as the output . from the reciprocity of light",
    "the reverse process must convert a bg beam back into a gaussian beam . herein lies the possibility of detecting particular bg modes , since gaussian modes may readily be detected by single mode fibers .",
    "the concept is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ concept ] .",
    "consider first a ray - based analysis following a heuristic argument : an incoming gaussian mode is converted by the first axicon to a bg mode of radial wavevector @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the refractive index of the axicon and @xmath16 is the axicon cone angle .",
    "this results in conical refraction at an angle @xmath17 .",
    "if this bg mode passes through an identical ( reversed ) axicon , then the refracted rays are collimated , or equivalently , the gaussian mode is generated again .",
    "if , on the other hand , the cone angle of the second axicon does not match the cone angle of the incoming bg beam , then the outgoing rays will not be perfectly corrected and equivalently a pure gaussian mode will not be formed .",
    "this detection is therefore @xmath13 specific and is reminiscent of a conventional lens telescope but with conical axicons rather than spherical lens . with the addition of a spiral plate with transmission function",
    "@xmath18 the detection method becomes specific to the bg order @xmath1 as well .    .",
    "an obstacle placed in the center of the bg region obstructed the generated beam for a minimum distance , @xmath19 , after which the bg mode reconstructs .",
    "( b - e ) experimental beam images of a bessel beam of order @xmath20 at four different positions .",
    "( f ) the bg beam is detected at the far field of a programmed hologram of a second axicon.,width=453 ]    this heuristic argument made more concrete by considering the problem from a physical optics perspective and employing digital holograms for the detection .",
    "the detection hologram may be written as @xmath21    where the first term represents an axicon to detect a bg with a radial wavevector of @xmath22 and the second term specifies the order , @xmath1 .",
    "such a hologram is shown in fig .",
    "[ spekbess ] ( a ) and the bg mode that it will detect in figs .",
    "[ spekbess ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "an inner product measurement is performed optically with the same set - up by considering the signal at the origin of the focal plane of the lens @xcite .",
    "the resulting signal can be calculated numerically from @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the field at the output plane ( focal plane of the lens ) , @xmath25 is the fourier transform , @xmath26 denotes the convolution process and @xmath27 is the incoming bg beam defined in ( [ bgmode ] ) .",
    "the angular spectrum of a bg mode and the fourier transform of the transmission function both have the shape of an annular ring . provided that the radii of these annular rings ( which represent the @xmath0 values of the modes ) are equal , the convolution of these rings will produce a bright spot with a gaussian profile in the center of the output plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spekbess ] ( d ) .",
    "this central peak is surrounded by a ring of twice the radius .     and ( b ) a bg mode profile of @xmath28 and ( c ) its fourier transform ( annular ring ) .",
    "the signal at the detector is shown for the scenarios of ( d ) matching @xmath13 and @xmath1 and ( e ) matching in @xmath1 but no matching in @xmath13 .",
    "the black and white insets show the theoretical results.,width=377 ]    if there is a mismatch in the respective radii ( @xmath4 values ) the central spot will itself become a small ring with a low intensity in the center , which will cause a negligible signal on the detector , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spekbess ] ( e ) . to quantify this",
    "we note that the width of the annular ring ( @xmath29 ) is governed by the radius of the gaussian envelope of the bg mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the width of the ring due to @xmath30 is determined by the size of the slm and is therefore much smaller than the corresponding width for the bg mode .",
    "we ll therefore assume that the ring for the axicon transmission function is vanishingly thin .",
    "the convolution of the two rings produces a function consisting of two rings with radii that are respectively equal to the sum and difference of the radii of the original rings .",
    "thus if the original radii were equal the convolution produces a central spot .",
    "conversely , if these original radii differ the intensity at the center of the output is given by @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the difference between the original radii .",
    "for @xmath33 the intensity at the center is essentially zero and the corresponding functions are considered to be orthogonal . likewise , if the @xmath1 value of the bg mode is different from that of the transmission function of the slm , they wo nt canceled during the convolution process .",
    "such a mismatch in @xmath1 values will cause the central peak in the convolution to have a phase singularity in the center and thus a central intensity null , which will produce a negligible signal on the detector .",
    "hence the bg mode detection method is sensitive to both radial ( @xmath0 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath1 ) indices .",
    "the experimental realization of the bg mode decomposition comprises of two parts : ( 1 ) the generation of a bg beam with known parameters ( modal profile ) and ( 2 ) the detection of this beam by modal analysis .",
    "this is accomplished by the optical system shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , where the created bg beam on @xmath34 is assumed to be our `` unknown '' beam .",
    "a hene laser was expanded with a 3@xmath35 telescope and directed onto a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , denoted as @xmath34 , with a beam width of @xmath36 mm .",
    "the slm ( holoeye , pluto - vis , @xmath37 pixels , with a pixel pitch of @xmath38 m ) was calibrated for a @xmath39 phase shift at a wavelength of 633 nm .",
    "@xmath34 was programmed with the conical phase of an axicon , plus a helical phase with an azimuthal index @xmath1 ranging from -10 to 10 .",

    "the detector was a ccd camera.,width=377 ]    the resulting image was filtered through the @xmath51 imaging system , and propagated a distance of @xmath52 mm ( for @xmath53 rad / m ) onto the detection slm , denoted as @xmath50 , where the transmission function was scanned through the spectrum of @xmath1 and @xmath13 values and the resulting signal detected by a ccd camera placed after a fourier transforming lens ( @xmath54 ) .    , decomposition for @xmath20",

    "[ graphs ] ( a ) and fig .  [ graphs ] ( b ) .",
    "the uncertainty in detection of the order @xmath1 is clearly negligible while that for the radial wavevector is approximately 5% ( one std dev ) .",
    "it is clear that a wide range of bessel modes can be detected quickly and accurately with this scheme .",
    "next , we illustrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to two perturbation studies : the self - healing of bessel beams after an obstacle and the propagation of bessel beams through turbulence .",
    "we use our detection method to experimentally observe the change in modal spectrum during these processes .",
    "a circular opague disk , with a radius of @xmath58 @xmath59 m , was used as the obstruction .",

    "the radial and azimuthal spectrum was measured before the obstruction and then at various distances after the obstruction until the self - healing process completed .",
    "we observed ( see fig .",
    "[ withoutobstruction ] ) minimal azimuthal distortion of the mode due to the obstruction , but significant broadening of the radial modes .",
