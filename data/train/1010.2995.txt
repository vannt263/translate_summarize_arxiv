    "one of the major goals of ultrarelativistic nuclear collision studies is to obtain information on the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "currently , one of the most direct approaches is the investigation of hadron production .",
    "hadron yields measured in central heavy ion collisions from ags up to rhic energies can be described very well @xcite within a hadro - chemical equilibrium model . in our approach",
    "@xcite the only parameters are the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath0 and the baryo - chemical potential @xmath1 ( and the fireball volume @xmath2 , in case yields rather than ratios of yields are fitted ) .",
    "other approaches @xcite employ ( several ) other , non - thermal , parameters . for a review see @xcite .",
    "the main result of these investigations was that the extracted temperature values rise rather sharply from low energies on towards @xmath310 gev and reach afterwards constant values near @xmath0=160 mev , while the baryochemical potential decreases smoothly as a function of energy .",
    "this limiting temperature @xcite behavior suggests a connection to the phase boundary and it was , indeed , argued @xcite that the quark - hadron phase transition drives the equilibration dynamically , at least for sps energies and above . for the lower energies , the quarkyonic state of matter @xcite could complement this picture by providing a new phase boundary at large @xmath1 values .",
    "the conjecture of the tricritical point @xcite was put forward in this context .",
    "the importance of measurements at very high energies to obtain information on the existence of a limiting temperature of excited hadronic matter produced in nuclear collisions was pointed out early @xcite based on analysis of particle spectra at the bevalac ( see also the review @xcite ) , from pions to heavier complex nuclei .    at first glance , it may seem inappropriate to use the chemical freeze - out concept for light nuclei , as their binding energies are a few mev , much less than the chemical freeze - out temperatures of 100 - 170 mev .",
    "we note , however , that the relative yield of particles composed of nucleons is determined by the entropy per baryon , which is fixed at chemical freeze - out .",
    "this has been first recognized already 30 years back @xcite and was subsequently further substantiated in @xcite , constituting the basis of thermal analyses of yields of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is entropy conservation , and not the difference between the binding energy and temperature of the system , which governs the production yields in this case after chemical freeze - out , entropy is conserved .",
    "it was also noted then that the yields obtained within the thermal model are in close agreement to those from coalescence models @xcite .",
    "the thermal model studies were already at that time extended to nuclei carrying strangeness ( hyperons in replacement of nucleons ) and even hypothetical objects with roughly equal number of up , down and strange quarks ( strangelets ) . at the same time , a vigorous line of theoretical investigations on the existence of multi - strange hypernuclei , or memos @xcite was established .",
    "recently , the first measurement of the lightest ( anti)hypernucleus , ( anti)hyper - tritium , in high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions was achieved by the star experiment at the rhic @xcite .",
    "this measurement opens up a very interesting new regime for tests of particle production at chemical equilibrium . at relatively low beam energies , where the baryo - chemical potential and , hence , the baryon density is maximum ( fair energy regime ) objects with a large number of baryons and moderate strangeness",
    "may be abundantly produced @xcite . at rhic and lhc energies production of objects with moderate",
    "( anti)baryon number and large strangeness content may be expected . in this paper",
    "we investigate and predict within the thermal model the production yields of heavy baryons and anti - baryons and in particular of hypernuclei and their antiparticles and confront these calculations with all presently available data ranging from ags to rhic energies .",

    "the measurement of the production yields of light nuclei ( and anti - nuclei ) without strangeness in central nuclear collisions provides significant constraints on thermal model parameters , in particular on the value of the baryo - chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "this is most easily seen when one recognizes that yield ratios such as @xmath8 scale like @xmath9}$ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the updated thermal fit to the hadron yield data measured at rhic ( @xmath6=200 gev ) including the newly - measured @xcite yield ratio @xmath7 . including this ratio significantly narrows the range of possible @xmath1 values , while @xmath0 and @xmath2 of the new fit remain unchanged ( @xmath0=164 mev , @xmath2=1960 @xmath10 ) compared to our earlier fit @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , the new fit leads to @xmath1=24@xmath112 mev , while without the ratio @xmath7 , @xmath1=30@xmath114 mev @xcite .",
    "the quality of the present fit is similar to that of the earlier one ( which had @xmath12/dof=29.7/12 ) .",
    "this result supports previous findings at lower energies @xcite .",
    "we stress that the agreement between the experimental value and the calculated one for the ratio @xmath7 is a powerful argument that indeed entropy conservation governs the production of light nuclei .",
    "if one were to use a temperature comparable to the binding energy per nucleon , that is @xmath0=5 mev , the calculated ratio would be 3.1@xmath1310@xmath14 , while it is 0.415 for @xmath0=164 mev , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .        in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show that predictions using the thermal model can be used to describe quantitatively the measured energy dependence of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 yield ratios over a very wide energy range the calculations , here and in the following , are performed using the parametrizations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 established in @xcite based on fits of midrapidity data in central collisions .",
    "the penalty against anti - particles at lower energies , well described within the thermal approach , is also drastically exhibited in this figure .",
    "note , in particular , the very good agreement between the model and the measurements at ags @xcite for the @xmath16 ratio , which extends the the range of the model agreement over 8 orders or magnitude ( for the other measurements see references in @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus natural to extend such analyses to light nuclei containing strangeness .",
    "note that , at the lowest energies , the canonical strangeness suppression is important and is incorporated in our model as described in @xcite . in the following",
    "we will therefore use the thermal model with the parameters as discussed to analyze the production of hypernuclei and their anti - particles and confront model predictions with the now available data .",
    "in table  [ tab1 ] we show a comparison of the measured data @xcite and model calculations for the best fit thermal parameters discussed above .",
    "the yield ratio @xmath18 is as well reproduced by the model as the ratio @xmath7 . on the other hand , the measured ratios of ( anti)hyper - tritium to ( anti)@xmath19 are larger than predicted in the model by about two standard deviations , using the statistical and systematic uncertainties quoted for the data",

    "[ fig3 ] we show the experimental energy dependence of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 ratios and confront these data with our thermal model predictions .",
    "the degree of agreement between data and calculations is impressive .",
    "we also include in this figure thermal model predictions for the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the broad maximum around @xmath35 gev for the ratio @xmath24 has the same origin as the maximum in the @xmath25 ratio , namely it arises as a consequence of strangeness neutrality condition , imposed in our model , and a competition between rising @xmath0 and decreasing @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we also note that a slightly less prominent maximum is likely to survive even if one relaxes the condition of strangeness neutrality , as demonstrated in @xcite . at high energies the value for the two ratios approach each other , as expected for decreasing values of @xmath1 at a nearly constant temperature .",
    "ratio ( see text ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the measured energy dependence for the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 ratio .",
    "this double ratio was suggested by the authors of @xcite in the expectation that dividing out the strange to non - strange baryon yield should result in a value near unity .",
    "the data are compared to thermal model predictions .",
    "note that there is negligible feed - down from heavier states into states with baryon number 3 .",
    "as expected , the measured energy dependence of the @xmath26 is well reproduced by the model calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrepancy between thermal model predictions and data for the @xmath27 ratio is apparent ( red line ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the ratio @xmath21 is significantly influenced by feed - down from strong decays of excited baryonic states , leading to a value for the double ratio significantly below unity . the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] contains such feed - down , the blue dashed line represents a calculation where the feeding is artificially left out .",
    "the feed - down from strong decays increases the @xmath21 ratio and , hence , reduces the overall ratio .",
    "the star collaboration actually measures a ratio close to 1 , above the thermal model prediction by twice the error quoted by the experiment .",
    "interestingly , results from the e864 collaboration @xcite ( as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) at ags energy are , albeit with large uncertainties , consistent with the thermal model prediction .",
    "the discrepancy at rhic energy , if experimentally established , would point to a new production mechanism not contained in the thermal approach and not present at lower beam energies .",
    "the possible existence of an excited @xmath28 state of ( anti)hyper - tritium has been recently pointed out to us @xcite . this excited state could contribute via decay to the ground state , and would lead to close agreement between model and data .",
    "further measurements at rhic and , very soon , lhc energy are eagerly awaited to shed light on the situation .     yield ratios . ]    to complete our studies we show , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , predictions within the thermal model for the energy dependence of the production yield of multistrange light hypernuclei @xcite relative to @xmath29 hyperons .",
    "these ratios exhibit a pronounced maximum in the fair energy regime , which is the consequence of a competition between a strong increase ( followed by saturation ) of @xmath0 and a strongly decreasing @xmath1 ( see also the discussion above ) .",
    "in addition , the canonical suppression , arising from the condition of local strangeness conservation , leads to reduced yields at low energies . in case of hyper - tritium production",
    ", there is no maximum , since it is mainly determined by the strong energy dependence of @xmath1 at low energies .",
    "it is larger at the ( low ) fair energies by two to three orders of magnitude compared to rhic and lhc energies .",
    "even larger are the differences between low and high energies for the production of the exotic multi - hyperon states .",
    "central collisions .",
    "the predicted yields of @xmath30 and @xmath31 nuclei are included for comparison , along with the corresponding anti - nuclei ( dashed lines ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show , as a function of energy , predictions of yields at midrapidity per one million central collisions .",
    "the volume at chemical freeze - out is that from our fits of yields @xcite . at fair energy",
    "the production yields of exotic nuclei is maximal , although the absolute yields are still rather small . as an example , for @xmath32 , the rate of production at 10@xmath33 central pb+pb collisions per second is about 60 per month , for a reasonable duty factor of the accelerator . assuming a reconstruction efficiency of the order of a percent",
    ", this implies a few candidates per year of data taking , clearly at the edge of achievability .    at the lhc , ( anti-)@xmath34he and their corresponding hypernuclei are experimentally accessible . for the lhc energy of 2.76 tev of the present data taking ,",
    "we predict ratios @xmath35he/@xmath34he and @xmath36/@xmath37 of 2.76@xmath38 and 2.70@xmath38 , respectively ( to be compared to the corresponding values for the rhic energy of 200 gev of 3.13@xmath38 and 2.37@xmath38 ) .",
    "these predictions can also be used as guideline for expectation in pp collisions at lhc energy , where one could estimate , in the grand - canonical limit , yields reduced by a factor of the order of 200 - 400 compared to pb+pb collisions .",
    "this is compensated by the much larger number of pp collisions ( about 10@xmath39 events ) which can be inspected at lhc ( for a running time of 10@xmath40 s per year of operation ) .",
    "this should allow , at the lhc , a measurement of the yields of produced ( anti-)hypernuclei up to mass number 4 in pp and pb - pb collisions and provide a detailed test of our predictions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the yield of light nuclei and their anti - particles are well reproduced with thermal model calculations employing parameters established from the analysis of general hadron production in relativistic nuclear collisions . as shown above",
    ", such ratios can be used to provide a precision constraint of the baryo - chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "we have furthermore shown that the newly measured yield ratio @xmath18 is also well described with the thermal approach , while the ratio @xmath41 which is reproduced at ags energy is significantly underpredicted at rhic energy .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is currently not clear and needs further study .",
    "our studies have also indicated interesting energy dependence in such yields and ratios . in particular , particles with large baryon number and moderate strangeness are produced in significant numbers at fair energy .",
    "the hyper - nuclei program , started by the star experiment at rhic , has made these studies very topical .",
    "although significant questions remain , it is clear that the study of the production of complex nuclei with and without strangeness in relativistic nuclear collisions can open a new chapter in the quest to understand the relation of particle production to the qcd phase boundary .",
    "the thermal model predictions can hopefully soon be tested also at the lhc energy with the data already collected in 2010 ."
