    "in this paper we continue the investigation of the infrared structure of quantum electrodynamics based on an algebraic model proposed earlier by one of us ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and papers cited therein ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this model is supposed to describe asymptotic fields in the quantum maxwell - dirac system , including the gauss law constraint ( as opposed to the crossed product of free fields ) .    in a recent paper @xcite this model",
    "was investigated in respect of the localization properties of fields .",
    "it was shown that one needs an extension of the localization regions : infrared / charge structure is encoded in unbounded regions .",
    "it was argued that from the point of view of scattering theory , the natural choice for extended localization regions consists of ` fattened lightcones ' , unions of intersecting : a future- and a past - lightcone .",
    "the test - functions of electromagnetic fields have well - defined asymptotes encoding the information on the long distance structure .    in the present article",
    "we show that the algebra can be localized in any ` time - slice ' which is fattening under constant inclination towards infinity .",
    "in addition , the localization of electromagnetic field may be restricted to ` fattened symmetrical spacelike cones ' : the unions of a spacelike cone and its reflection with respect to a  point in its inside .",
    "similar restriction seems to be ruled out , even asymptotically , for charged fields .",
    "this seems to contradict general wisdom on the expected behavior of fields in full electrodynamics , see e.g.the assumptions on which buchholz @xcite bases his selection criterion of representations in quantum electrodynamics . whether this points to some incompleteness of the model is an open question",
    "; see the discussion at the beginning of section [ locdir ] below and in conclusions . on the other hand , we show that in the present model , in agreement with the general expectation , one can superpose two appropriately `` dressed '' dirac fields carrying opposite charges to obtain a local observable .",
    "this article should be regarded as a continuation of refs . @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the reader to these references for more detail and a wider background .",
    "however , we briefly summarize notation and the formulation of the model in the next two sections .",
    "we obtain spacelike localization of fields in sections 4 and 5 , and discuss the results in concluding section 6 .",
    "the geometry of the spacetime is given by the affine minkowski space @xmath0 .",

    "nevertheless , we have also shown that compactly supported observables may be formed by simple multiplication of appropriately dressed charged fields with compensating charges .",
    "the lack of spacelike - cone localization of dressed dirac fields in the present model seems to be nonstandard , as already mentioned in introduction and section  5 .",
    "one could object that the model , although it incorporates global gauss law , still lacks some additional asymptotic electromagnetic variables .",
    "the construction of the model suggests that in such case the variables would have to originate as limits of gauge - dependent local electromagnetic potentials .",
    "however , whether the model is indeed incomplete can only be decided by finding its place in a formulation of fully interacting electrodynamics .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to formulate a perturbative electrodynamics incorporating some nonperturbative infrared aspects of the present model .    on the other hand",
    ", we would like to stress once more a physically important aspect of the model considered here .",
    "our fundamental fermion fields are genuinely charged , satisfying gauss law even before ` dressing ' .",
    "dressing is considered for the sake of inducing a certain localization of these fields , as well as an auxiliary step in the construction of bi - fermion observables . simplified",
    "as the model is , it is at the same time non - perturbative .",
    "this is to be contrasted with all forms of ` dressing ' of fermion fields in local formulations of qed .",
    "there , in the indefinite metric space ( gupta - bleuler ) , local dirac fields can not carry physical charge , as they commute with the electric flux at spatial infinity . after constructing a perturbative solution of an initial theory formulated in such space , one attempts then , by the addition of lorenz condition and nonlocal dressing of charged fields , to restore maxwell equations and transport the theory into a hilbert space of physical vector states .",
    "the dressing takes the form of a formal local gauge transformation in which the gauge function is constructed with the use of electromagnetic potential ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in an ansatz",
    "put forward by dirac this has the following form : @xmath544\\psi(x)\\,,\\quad   \\mathcal{a}(x)=a(x)-\\partial g(x)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath545 ; here @xmath546 is a  vector distribution satisfying @xmath547 . within perturbative approach",
    "to qed this idea has been implemented most rigorously in the ` axiomatic perturbative ' formulation by steinmann  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the above tentative transformation is carried out not on the level of fields , but rather wightman functions . as argued by steinmann ,",
    "the results are insensitive to a choice of a particular form of the distribution @xmath548 . and as among such distributions are some with supports in spacelike cones , one can argue that in this way charged fields may be pushed into such regions .    these constructions , rigorous as they are within the limits of the procedure followed in this approach , are not without weak points .",
    "first , not only the local interaction , but also the dressing exponent is treated perturbatively ; this is admitted by steinmann himself to be an obstacle to a completely reliable representation of the infrared problems .",
    "secondly , the dressing transformation is infrared - singular and can not be performed in this form even at the level of wightmann functions ; the actual way it is done , is via an effective spatial truncation followed by an adiabatic limit .",
    "however , precisely these two points are of critical importance for the infrared problem .",
    "finally , we want to comment on our choice of representations .",
    "one can not exclude that the use of some more infrared singular representations would modify our results .",
    "that localization may be improved ` in front of ' infravacua ( kpr - type representations @xcite ) has been shown by kuhnhardt @xcite in a scalar model due to buchholz _",
    "one of the main motivations for the introduction of such more singular representations of free electromagnetic fields is the fact that they may be stable under the addition of radiation fields produced in scattering processes .",
    "however , in this connection we want to mention two facts on the asymptotic model considered here .",
    "first , it has been shown in @xcite that representations discussed above in section [ repr ] do suffice to absorb radiation fields produced by a classical current .",
    "second , in this model the fields are not completely decoupled , and the electric flux at spatial infinity is due both to free as well as coulomb parts . however",
    ", the electric flux of the total field at infinity is an invariant characteristic of the process , not changing with time ( the asymptotic flux depends on the spacelike direction , but , in fact , is invariant under any finite spacetime translation of the point from which we go to spacelike infinity ) .",
    "this is a fact in classical theory , and should be also expected in the full quantum theory .",
    "we prove here the relation .",
    "let @xmath224 and @xmath225 and denote , @xmath549 , @xmath550 .",
    "then @xmath551 where we have used .",
    "thus @xmath552 .",
    "consider now two cases .",
