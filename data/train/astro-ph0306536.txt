    "observational astronomy and astrophysics are based on the detection of information carriers to determine the properties of the emitting objects .",
    "three types of carriers have been used so far : electromagnetic radiation , cosmic rays , and neutrinos .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation was the first to be observed . due to their neutral charge",
    ", photons are not deflected by interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields , therefore they point directly back to their source .",
    "photons are emitted within the outer regions of the sources and they can not give any information about the source internal processes .",
    "moreover , high energy photons are affected by interactions with the microwave and infrared backgrounds ( mostly through @xmath21 ) , as they traverse intergalactic distances .",
    "this limits the range of cosmological sources that can be observed with the highest energy photons .",
    "cosmic rays are composed of charged nuclei and are deflected by magnetic fields , so they do nt bring directional information and they are subject to energy loss processes during their propagation , which deforms the energy spectrum measured at the earth with respect to the one at the source .",
    "moreover the highest energy cosmic rays ( @xmath22ev ) are expected to be absorbed due to collisions with microwave background photons , through @xmath23 ( greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin , or gzk cutoff @xcite ) .",
    "this would generate a degradation of proton energy after a distance of 50 mpc @xcite .",
    "thus , while cosmic rays carry some information about the energy distribution mechanisms at their source , they can not indicate directly where those sources are located and they can not propagate for cosmological distances ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "neutrinos have no electric charge and have a low interaction cross - section with matter .",
    "they can propagate from the production sources through cosmological distances , un - deflected by magnetic fields .",
    "the distance at which the universe can be observed with high energy neutrinos is limited only by the signal strength of the source .",
    "thus , they can reach the earth carrying the complete flux and spectral information about their generation mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , their low cross - section makes them difficult to detect .",
    "very large detectors , long exposure times and sophisticated data analyses are needed to measure high energy extraterrestrial neutrino fluxes and spectra .",
    "high energy cosmic neutrinos are beleived to be produced in energetic accelerating environments through p - p or p-@xmath24 interactions via @xmath25 production and decay .",
    "such an accelerator might be the core of an active galaxy , powered by a supermassive black hole .",
    "the energy dependence of the expected neutrino spectrum is predicted to be @xmath26 e@xmath27 .",
    "after greisen s 1960 review on cosmic ray showers @xcite , the detection of neutrinos was suggested by markov and zheleznikh @xcite via the process    @xmath28    of upward or horizontal neutrinos interacting with a nucleon @xmath29 of the matter surrounding the detector . at high energy , approximately half of the neutrino energy",
    "is carried by the produced lepton and the angle between the neutrino and the lepton is , for muon flavor @xcite",
    "@xmath30    where @xmath31 the neutrino energy . at sufficiently high neutrino energy",
    "the muon is collinear with the parent neutrino and the muon detection will give information on the neutrino direction .",
    "the possibility to measure the high energy cosmic neutrino direction opened the door to neutrino astrophysics .",
    "this idea started to become reality with the dumand project @xcite in the deep pacific ocean near hawaii .",
    "this pioneering effort opened the road to the realization of the first dedicated working projects , baikal @xcite and amanda @xcite , and to the two planned projects in the mediterranean sea nestor @xcite and antares @xcite .",
    "figure 2 : _ amanda - ii schematics _",
    "amanda is a neutrino telescope built and operated at the geographic south pole .",
    "the final detector configuration , called amanda - ii , was deployed in four south pole campaigns between november 1995 and february 2000 @xcite .",
    "the detector consists of 677 optical modules ( om ) arranged on 19 vertical strings deployed at depths between 1300 - 2400 meters .",
    "the used instrumented volume ranges between 1500 - 2000 meters , and covers a cylinder of 200 meters diameter ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "an amanda - ii om consists of a single 8 inch hamamatsu r5912 - 2 photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) housed in a glass pressure vessel .",
    "the pmt is optically coupled to the glass housing by a transparent gel .",
    "each module is connected to electronics on the surface by a dedicated electrical cable , which supplies high voltage and carries the anode signal of the pmt . for each event ,",
    "the om is read out by a peak - sensing adc and tdc capable of registering up to eight separate pulses @xcite .",
    "the first 10 strings , completed in 1997 and containing 302 oms , are known as amanda - b10 , with 120 m diameter .",
    ".2 cm    figure 3 : _ cherenkov light detection topology in the amanda - ii array for tracks ( left ) and cascades ( right ) _    the holes where amanda strings are buried , were produced with high pressure hot water ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the drilling procedure was continuously monitored and the average hole diameter was approximately @xmath33 cm over the entire hole , with a depth - variation , due to the ice temperature profile .",
    "the string deployment is done just after drilling is finished and before the hole diameter starts to shrink due to refreezing .",
    "each om is connected to the main cable and tested in situ at deployment time .",
    "the south pole air shower experiment ( spase ) is a surface array which measures the the shower direction and size , via the electron density @xcite .",
    "the spase / amanda coincident events are used to study the cosmic ray composition above @xmath34 ev .",
    "the channels through which neutrino telescopes detect neutrinos above energies of a few tens of gev is by observing the cherenkov light from relativistic leptons produced in @xmath35-nucleon interactions ( eq . [ eq : nu ] ) in or near the telescope .",
    "the primary channel is the @xmath36 , which leads to a high energy @xmath37 track .",
    "the muons can propagate several kilometers through the ice and they can be reconstructed with reasonable precision even with a coarsely instrumented detector , provided the medium is sufficiently transparent . the time and amplitude of detected signals are used to reconstruct the path of the muon through the detector .    the other possible detection channels @xmath38 and @xmath39 have a different behavior .",
    "an electron , produced by a @xmath38 , will generate an electromagnetic cascade , which is confined to a volume of a few cubic meters .",
    "it overlays the hadronic cascade of the primary interaction vertex .",
    "the size of both cascades is small compared to the om spacing in the array and the signature is an expanding spherical shell of cherenkov photons ( figure 3 ) .",
    "a @xmath40 , produced by a @xmath39 , will decay immediately and generate a second hadronic cascade .",
    "however , at energies above 1 pev the two cascades are separated by several tens of meters , connected by a single track .",
    "a detected event corresponds to a realization of a majority trigger of a predefined hit om channels within 2.5 @xmath37s . to ensure that the observed muons are produced by neutrinos , the earth is used as a filter and only up - going muons are selected .",
    "this condition is used to reduce the contamination from down - going cosmic ray muon flux .",
    "the location depth in the ice serves to further minimize the flux of cosmic ray muons .",
    ".4 cm    figure 4 : _ left : effective scattering coefficient as a function of depth at 532 nm wavelength .",
    "right : absorption and effective scattering ( @xmath41 ) coefficients versus wavelengths . _",
    "the ice surrounding amanda is part of the neutrino telescope and its optical properties are very important and are directly connected to the detector sensitivity . these properties were studied in detail , using in - situ light emitters located on the strings and the down - going muon flux itself .",
    "this study shows the ice is not homogeneous @xcite , but it can be considered as made of several horizontal layers , laid down by varying climatological conditions in the past @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the effective scattering length versus depth for 532 nm .",
    "the figure shows also the absorption and effective scattering lengths as a function of wavelength for 2 different depths . at 400 nm ( corresponding to the maximum om optical sensitivity ) the average absorption length at amanda - ii depth is 110 m and the average effective scattering length is 20 m @xcite .",
    "the light emitters on the strings are used also as a detector time and geometry calibration system .",
    "the time calibration is a measure of the cable length and , therefore , of pmt signal time delay due to cable propagation .",
    "the overall precision on the photon arrival times is approximately 5 ns .",
    "the position calibration is performed using two sets of information : the absolute array position , obtained from drill recordings and pressure sources , and the relative positions , obtained with the measured propagation times of photons between different light emitters and receivers .",
    "the position of the oms are determined with a precision of about 0.5 m @xcite .",
    "in order to study the detector response to the different event sources , a monte carlo simulation covering the complete chain from the primary particle flux interactions to the detector response , is used to evaluate the array sensitivity .",
    "the down - going muon flux is generated by using corsika ( v6.020 ) shower generator with qgsjet01 interaction model @xcite ; the up - going muons are generated with a program called nusim @xcite , which allows us to simulate any @xmath42 spectrum , the propagation through the earth and their interactions .",
    "the produced muons are propagated through the ice , taking into account all the relevant energy losses @xcite .",
    "the cherenkov photon production and propagation are simulated taking into account the ice optical properties and the om acceptance .",
    "the detector trigger simulation includes the hardware response of each om @xcite . at this stage",
    "the simulated data are treated exactly as the experimental raw data and passed through the same data processing .",
    "the amanda data are passed through a standard filter which is common to all the neutrino analyses .",
    "this filtering is performed in 2 separate levels .",
    "the level 1 filter ( l1 ) includes the om cleaning , which excludes the channels which are dead or have odd transient behavior , performs time calibration and a first guess reconstruction .",
    "a loose angular cut on the approximate reconstructed muon track is used to filter upward moving tracks and to reduce the amount of data to be passed to the following level .",
    "the level 2 filter ( l2 ) applies iterative likelihood reconstructions , which take into account the ice properties , and a bayesian reconstruction @xcite .",
    "a second cut on the likelihood reconstructed angle is applied to further reduce the down - going event contamination . to study down - going muon events",
    "the same filter levels are applied but with no angular cut .",
    "the largest background source for amanda is represented by the down - going cosmic ray muon flux , which is 5 orders of magnitude larger than the total expected neutrino flux , and contributes to the detector trigger with a rate of @xmath43 hz .",
    "selecting upward reconstructed events ( sect .",
    "[ s : datasim ] ) has an important effect in removing a large fraction of these events , but due to the finite reconstruction resolution a small fraction of down - going muon events is mis - reconstructed as upward .",
    "such events represent a background which still needs to be eliminated in any neutrino analysis .",
    "nevertheless the large cosmic ray muon flux can be used to study the detector response , possible systematic effects and also to perform physics measurements .",
    "the cosmic ray muon angular and vertical intensities were measured in amanda - ii and they agree well with simulation , with other experimental measurements and with theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "these measured distributions are related to the sea - level muon and primary cosmic ray energy spectrum .",
    "the measured spectral index of sea - level differential muon spectrum ( @xmath44 ) and of primary differential cosmic ray spectrum ( @xmath45 ) are in agreement with other experimental results @xcite .",
    "the down - going muon events which are in coincidence with spase surface array @xcite were used to measure the cosmic ray mass composition as a function of the primary energy near the knee .",
    "an energy resolution of @xmath46 was achieved in the energy range of 1 - 10 pev and a tendency toward heavier nuclei above the knee was measured @xcite .",
    "the down - going muon flux is well understood and an on - going analysis is examining the sensitivity for detecting muons from charmed meson decays in the atmosphere .",
    "uncorrelated , multiple atmospheric muon events represent another source of background for neutrino analyses . the expected rate of such events is very low in amanda - ii ( of the order of @xmath47 hz , higher than neutrino trigger rate ) but their contamination can not be neglected as for amanda - b10 .",
    "the contamination of such events becomes clear at high quality cut level where the bulk of atmospheric muons has been eliminated .",
    "a typical uncorrelated muon event could be a muon hitting the upper detector and one hitting the lower detector shortly before .",
    "the reconstruction tries to find the best up - going single muon track compatible with the recorded hit times .",
    "the easiest way to eliminate such a background is to require a uniform hit distribution along the reconstructed track .",
    ".4 cm    figure 5 : _ left : the zenith angle distribution of up - going reconstructed events .",
    "monte carlo prediction is normalized to the experimental data .",
    "right : skyplot of the reconstructed events in equatorial coordinates . _      in order to measure the atmospheric neutrino component , a rejection factor of @xmath48 is needed to eliminate the cosmic ray muon background contamination .",
    "the detection of atmospheric neutrinos in amanda provided the first check of the detector sensitivity @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the published result from the year 1997 of amanda - b10 .",
    "the 130.1 days livetime analyzed gave @xmath49 experimental reconstructed events with a prediction of @xmath50 .",
    "normalizing the monte carlo simulated events to the experimental sample at high quality level gives a background contamination ( i.e. a residual leakage of down - going muons reconstructed as up - going ) of 5 - 10 % .",
    "the low neutrino acceptance close to the horizon reflects the effect of down - going muon background elimination .",
    "the track pointing resolution is @xmath51 and the skyplot , shown in figure 6 , is consistent with a uniform isotropic flux .",
    "the estimated energy of detected neutrino sample ranges between 66 gev and 3.4 tev ( 90 % of events ) @xcite .",
    "amanda - ii detector , with its increased size , has a better sensitivity than amanda - b10 and its larger diameter allows us to better reconstruct the horizontal events .",
    "thus the acceptance near the horizon is improved and the down - going muon flux rejection turns out to be an easier task than with the smaller detector . requiring a minimum number of direct hits ( i.e. hits with a small time residual with respect to the direct cherenkov light time of propagation ) , a high likelihood of reconstruction value and a uniform light deposition along the reconstructed track , we record about 4 well reconstructed neutrino events per day in amanda - ii .",
    "the preliminary unfolded @xmath36 sea - level energy spectrum was determined and is in agreement with the expectation up to @xmath52 gev @xcite .",
    "a search for high energy neutrino flux from unresolved sources throughout the universe was done in amanda - b10 , using the data taken during 1997 . after cleaning the experimental data sample from atmospheric muon background ,",
    "the neutrino event selection was designed to retain high energy track - like events @xcite in order to eliminate the lower energy atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "the energy cut is performed through the hit channel multiplicity observable .",
    "the amanda - b10 sensitivity was tested with respect to an assumed high energy neutrino spectrum given by @xmath53e@xmath54cm@xmath27s@xmath56sr@xmath56gev@xmath56 .",
    "this spectrum was simulated along with the atmospheric neutrinos and the detector response was studied .",
    "optimizing the atmospheric neutrino background rejection with a suitable channel multiplicity cut , there is no excess of events with respect to the estimated background and a limit was set on the high energy flux .",
    "figure 6 shows the effect of the energy cut on the atmospheric and high energy neutrino events ( on the left ) and the calculated limit ( on the right ) .",
    "the limit , including 25% atmospheric neutrino flux systematic uncertainty , is @xmath57e@xmath54cm@xmath27s@xmath56sr@xmath56gev@xmath56    as stated in section [ s : back ] , amanda - ii is bigger than amanda - b10 and the background which needs to be eliminated has larger intensity and includes the coincident uncorrelated atmospheric muon events .",
    "the tested high energy neutrino flux is @xmath58e@xmath54cm@xmath27s@xmath56sr@xmath56gev@xmath56 and the optimized energy cut selects events between 10 tev and 10 pev . since 1997 about 10 times the exposure has been achieved in total with amanda - b10 ( 1997 - 99 ) and amanda - ii ( 2000-present ) .",
