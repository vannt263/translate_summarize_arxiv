    "the presence of energetic nonthermal particles , especially electrons , in clusters of galaxies has been inferred from observations of so - called `` radio halos '' and `` radio relics '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* for reviews ) .",
    "the radio emission from these sources is interpreted as synchrotron radiation of cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons . the radio halos center",
    "roughly in cluster cores and have low surface brightness with steep radio spectrum and low polarization .",
    "radio relics , on the contrary , are isolated structures , typically located in the cluster outskirts but within virial radii .",
    "they often exhibit sharp edges , and most of them show strong polarization .",
    "in fact , with occasional pairings found in the opposite side of clusters and elongated morphologies , radio relics are commonly thought to reveal shock waves in intracluster media ( icms ) produced during mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , relics are found mostly too far from cluster cores for their x - ray signatures to be easily detected .",
    "so only in a few cases , their association with icm shocks have been established by x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more than 40 relics have been identified in radio observations so far ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "based on the spatial distribution of shocks seen in cluster formation simulations , it is predicted that coming radio surveys will easily identify hundreds more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed synchrotron radiation is expected to come from cr electrons with lorentz factors @xmath2 , spiraling in @xmath3 g magnetic fields .",
    "the cooling time scale of such cr electrons due to synchrotron emission and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering does not much exceed @xmath4 yrs ( see equation ( [ trad ] ) ) .",
    "advection or diffusion over that time would typically be limited to @xmath5 kpc .",
    "so , the electrons have very likely been injected , accelerated or re - accelerated close to where they are seen in emission .",
    "shocks , believed to be associated to observed radio relics , are obvious candidates for the acceleration or re - acceleration of the cr electrons .",
    "suprathermal particles are known to be produced as an inevitable consequence of the formation of collisionless shocks in tenuous plasmas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if postshock suprathermal particles have sufficient rigidity to recross the shock transition , they can be further accelerated to become crs through so - called diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite .",
    "only a very small fraction of inflowing plasma particles are `` injected '' from the thermal pool into the cr population . yet , in strong shocks , a sufficient number of crs reach high energies , so that they extract a substantial fraction of the dissipated energy , allowing dsa to be efficient .",
    "shock waves are indeed common in the intergalactic space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are induced by the supersonic flow motions produced during the hierarchical formation of the large - scale structure ( lss ) in the universe .",
    "those shocks are , in fact , the dominant means to dissipate the gravitational energy which is released during the lss formation .",
    "they broadly reflect the dynamics of baryonic matter in the lss of the universe , and , indirectly , dark matter .",
    "simulations suggest that while very strong shocks form in relatively cooler environments in filaments and outside cluster virial radii , shocks produced by mergers and flow motions in hotter icms are relatively weak with mach number @xmath1 a few @xcite .    at weak shocks ,",
    "however , dsa should be inefficient .",
    "this is expected from the fact that the particle energy spectrum associated with dsa is steep when the density compression across a shock is small .",
    "also the relative difference between the postshock thermal and flow speeds is greater in weaker shocks .",
    "consequently , the injection from thermal to nonthermal particles should be inefficient at weak shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at shocks with @xmath1 a few , much less than @xmath6 of protons",
    "are thought to be injected into crs and much less than @xmath7 % of the shock ram pressure be converted into the downstream pressure of cr protons @xcite . for reference ,",
    "recent fermi observations of @xmath8-ray emission from galaxy clusters , searching for @xmath8-ray by - products of @xmath9 collisions , limit the pressure due to cr protons to less than @xmath10 % of the gas thermal pressure there @xcite .",
    "iact ( imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique ) observations of tev @xmath8-ray suggest even a lower limit of @xmath11 % in core regions of some clusters @xcite .",
    "injection and acceleration of electrons are even more problematic at weak shocks .",
    "relativistic electrons and protons of the same energy are accelerated the same in dsa , since they have the same rigidity .",
    "but nonrelativistic electrons of a given energy have substantially smaller rigidities than protons , making them much harder to be injected at shocks from the thermal pool . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of electrons injected and accelerated to the cr population is likely to be significantly smaller than that of cr protons , and so is the pressure of cr electrons at weak shocks .",
    "hot icms , on the other hand , should have gone first through accretion shocks of high mach numbers around clusters and filaments and then through weaker shocks inside those nonlinear structures @xcite .",
    "hence , it is expected that icms contain some cr populations produced through dsa at the structure formation shocks .",
    "in addition , in icms , nonthermal particles can be produced via turbulent re - acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . moreover ,",
    "secondary cr electrons are also continuously generated through @xmath9 collisions of cr protons with thermal protons of icms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if radio relics form in media with such `` pre - existing '' crs , the problem of inefficient injection at weak shocks can be alleviated .    in this paper , we study dsa of cr electrons at shocks expected to be found in icms , with and without pre - existing cr electrons . since the shocks are mostly weak , the cr pressure is likely to be a small fraction of the thermal pressure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "so we apply dsa in the test - particle regime . in the time - asymptotic limit without radiative losses ,",
    "the test - particle dsa theory predicts a steady - state distribution of power - law for downstream cr electrons , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density compression ratio across a shock , when no pre - existing cr is assumed @xcite .",
    "if pre - existing cr electrons of a power - law distribution , @xmath15 , are assumed , the distribution of re - accelerated electrons approaches @xmath16 with @xmath17 at large momenta ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these properties provide essential benchmarks for expected spectral properties    we perform `` time - dependent '' , dsa simulations of cr electrons for plane - parallel shocks , which include the energy losses due to synchrotron and ic processes . using the simulation data",
    ", we calculate the synchrotron emission from cr electrons , and model the synchrotron flux and spectral distributions from spherical shocks .",
    "we then compare the resulting distributions to those of two well - observed radio relics in clusters ciza j2242.8 + 5301 @xcite and zwcl0008.8 + 5215 @xcite in details .",
    "the relic in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 at redshift @xmath22 perhaps demonstrates the best evidence for dsa at merger shocks .",
    "it is located at a distance of @xmath23 mpc from the cluster center and spans @xmath24 mpc in length .",
    "the relic shows a spectral index gradient towards the cluster center . the spectral index , measured between 2.3 and 0.61 ghz , steepens from @xmath25 to @xmath26 across the relic .",
    "the relic is strongly polarized at the @xmath27 % level , indicating ordered magnetic fields aligned with the relic . in the opposite , southern part of the cluster , an accompanying fainter and smaller relic is found . the relic in zwcl0008.8 + 5215 at @xmath28 is found at a distance of @xmath29 mpc from the cluster center and has a linear extension of @xmath30 mpc .",
    "it also shows the steepening of the spectral index towards the cluster center .",
    "the spectral index , measured between 1382 and 241 mhz , changes from @xmath31 to @xmath26 across the relic .",
    "the polarization fraction is less with @xmath32 % .",
    "it also has an accompanying relic of a linear extension of @xmath33 kpc in the opposite , western side of the cluster .    in section 2",
    "we describe the numerical method and the models for magnetic field , diffusion , electron injection , and pre - existing cr electron population .",
    "we present analytic evaluations for some features in the cr electron energy spectrum and synchrotron emission spectrum in section 3 .",
    "the results of simulations are presented and compared with observations of the previously mentioned radio relics in section 4 .",
    "summary follows in section 5 .",
    "we simulate dsa of cr electrons at gasdynamical shocks in one - dimensional plane - parallel geometry .",
    "shocks in icms , especially merger shocks , are expected to persist over @xmath34 yrs , a substantial fraction of the cluster lifetime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , the time scales over which electrons are accelerated and cool are much shorter ( see eq . [ [ trad ] ] below ) .",
    "so we assume that the shock structure remains steady . assuming that the cr feedback to the flow is negligible at weak shocks in the test - particle limit , the background flow , @xmath35 , is given by the usual shock jump condition .",
    "then , the time - dependent evolution of the cr electron distribution , @xmath36 , which is averaged over pitch angles , can be followed by the following diffusion convection equation , @xmath37 + p { \\partial \\over { \\partial y } } \\left ( { b_e\\over p^2 } g_e \\right ) \\label{dce},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the electron mass , @xmath41 is the speed of light , and @xmath42 is the spatial diffusion coefficient @xcite .    here , @xmath43 represents the cooling of cr electrons due synchrotron and ic losses in cgs units , where @xmath44 is the electron charge . the `` effective '' magnetic field strength , @xmath45 , includes the equivalent strength of the cosmic background radiation with @xmath46 at redshift @xmath47 .",
    "the cooling time scale for electrons is given as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lorentz factor of cr electrons .",
    "the equation in ( [ dce ] ) is solved using the test - particle version of the crash ( cosmic - ray amr shock ) code ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .      here , shocks are assumed to be gasdynamical for simplicity , that is , magnetic fields do not modify the background flow of the shock . in icms ,",
    "magnetic fields of an inferred strength of order @xmath0 g @xcite are dynamically unimportant , since their energy density is less than @xmath50 of the thermal energy density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , magnetic fields , especially in the downstream region , are the key that governs dsa and the synchrotron cooling and emission of cr electrons .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that efficient magnetic field amplification via resonant and non - resonant wave - particle interactions is an integral part of dsa at strong shocks @xcite .",
    "in addition , magnetic fields can be amplified by turbulent motions behind shocks @xcite . yet",
    ", these plasma processes are complex and their roles are not yet entirely certain , especially at weak shocks .",
    "so here we adopt a simple model in which the magnetic field strength is amplified by a constant factor of @xmath51 across the shock , that is , @xmath52 .",
    "hereafter , we use the subscripts ` 1 ' , and ` 2 ' to label conditions in the preshock and postshock regions , respectively .    for @xmath53 , we adopt a bohm - like diffusion coefficient with weaker non - relativistic momentum dependence , @xmath54 where @xmath55 in the preshock region and @xmath56 in the postshock region .",
    "as pointed in introduction , the injection of electrons is expected to be much harder than that of protons in the so - called thermal leakage injection model . because complex plasma interactions among crs , waves , and the underlying gas flow are not fully understood",
    ", it is not yet possible to predict from first principles how particles are injected into the first - order fermi process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , postshock thermal electrons , which have gyro - radii smaller than those of thermal protons , need to be pre - accelerated to several times the peak momentum of thermal protons , @xmath57 , before they can re - cross the shock transition layer . here , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the postshock gas temperature and @xmath60 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "recently several authors have suggested pre - acceleration mechanisms based on plasma interactions with fluctuating magnetic fields that are locally quasi - perpendicular to the shock surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "but the detailed picture of the electron injection is not well constrained by plasma physics .",
    "observationally , the ratio of cr electron number to proton number , @xmath61 , is commonly inferred for strong supernova remnant shocks , since about 1% of the galactic cr flux near a gev is due to electrons @xcite . but this ratio is rather uncertain for weak shocks under consideration .",
    "so here we adopt a simple model in which the postshock electrons above a certain injection momentum , @xmath62 , are assumed to be injected to the cr population . here , @xmath63 is a parameter that depends on the shock mach number and turbulent magnetic field amplitude in the thermal leakage injection model @xcite . the cr electron number density or , equivalently",

    "we consider the population of pre - existing cr electrons , along with that of freshly injected electrons at the shock .",
    "however , the nature of pre - existing cr electrons in icms is not well constrained .",
    "if they were generated at previous , external and internal shocks , a spectral slope of @xmath67 is expected for @xmath68 , close to the acceleration site . however , since their lifetime in equation ( [ trad ] ) is much shorter than that of host clusters , it is unlikely that they are directly responsible for the pre - existing electron population we consider here .",

    ", @xmath98 could be regarded as a canonical value .",
    "we note that the resulting radio emission is linearly scaled with both @xmath99 and the preshock gas density , @xmath100 , in the test - particle regime , so the combined parameter , @xmath101 , can be treated as a free parameter .",
    "we here fix the preshock gas density , @xmath102 , as a fiducial parameter , but vary @xmath99 to match the observed fluxes of radio relics .",
    "another measure is the ratio of postshock cr electron pressure to gas pressure , @xmath103 , which depends on both @xmath99 and the slopes @xmath94 and @xmath75 . in modeling of specific radio relics in section 4.2",
    ", we will determine the set of values for @xmath99 , @xmath104 and @xmath80 , that matches the observed level of radio flux .",
    "if we ignore for the moment the modest influence of continued dsa downstream of the shock , we can follow the electron population that advects downstream by solving the following equation : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 . here",

    "we compare the distributions described by equation ( [ gapprox ] ) with those from time - dependent dsa simulations , demonstrating that equation ( [ gapprox ] ) provides reasonable approximations to the solutions of full dsa simulations ( see table 1 for specific model parameters ) .",
    "since the synchrotron emission from mono - energetic electrons with @xmath117 has a broad peak around @xmath118 , for a given observation frequency , @xmath119 , the greatest contribution comes from electrons of the lorentz factor , @xmath120 using equations ( [ trad ] ) and ( [ fpeak ] ) , the cooling time of the electrons emitting at @xmath119 can be estimated approximately as @xmath121 the cooling length behind the shock , @xmath122 , then becomes @xmath123 note that @xmath124 for the model parameters considered here .",

    "so @xmath126 should represent the width of radio emitting region at @xmath119 behind plane - parallel shocks . in radio relics , however , the observed width is constrained by both @xmath126 and the projection angle of spherical shocks ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the cutoff energy in the electron spectrum due to the radiative cooling decreases linearly with the distance from the shock location , that is , @xmath127 , as expected from equation ( [ trad ] ) and shown in figure 1 . at the farthest downstream point ,",

    "on the other hand , dominate at higher energies including @xmath159 and they are most relevant for the synchrotron emission at @xmath160 ghz .",
    "the slope of the accelerated spectrum at high energies is similar to that of the pre - existing spectrum , which is consistent with equation ( [ f2 ] ) . on the contrary , in m2b2.3s5.4 model with @xmath161 ,",

    "they are compared with the `` deconvolved '' profile of observed flux taken form figure 4 of @xcite ( filled circles ) .",
    "since the observed flux is given in an arbitrary unit in their paper , we scale it so that the peak value of @xmath182 becomes 5 mjy , which is close to the observed value ( private communication with r. j. van weeren ) .",

    "the observed value of the spectral index at @xmath191 , @xmath150 , is reproduced either in the injection - only models with @xmath142 or in the model with pre - existing crs with the slope @xmath192 , as noted in the previous subsection .    for the fiducial preshock particle density of @xmath193 , the values of the postshock electron cr number fraction required to match the peak flux of 5 mjy are @xmath194 , and @xmath195 for m4.5b7i , m4.5b3.5i , and m2b7s4.2 , respectively . in m2b7s4.2 model",
    "the ratio of the pressure of pre - existing cr electrons to gas pressure far upstream is @xmath196 .",
    "those values of @xmath99 and @xmath80 are modest enough that they probably are not in conflict with the values expected in clusters .",
    "our results demonstrate that if the pre - existing electron population is considered , the radio relic in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 can be reproduced even with weak shocks of @xmath197 or so .",
    "we note that @xmath80 is a model parameter that sets the amplitude , @xmath78 , of the upstream population , while the fraction @xmath99 is the outcome of dsa of both pre - existing and injected electrons .",
    "as noted in figure 1 , in m2b7s4.2 model the fraction @xmath99 is determined mostly by the `` injected '' population at low energies , while the radio emission is regulated mostly by the `` re - accelerated '' population at @xmath159 .",
    "so we should obtain the similar radio flux even with a much lower injection rate for this model , and the resulting @xmath99 could be much smaller than the current value of @xmath195 .",
    "we point that the radio relic in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 is subtended in the plane of the sky over the angle of @xmath198 .",
    "this means that the surface of the shock responsible for the relic should be highly elongated with the aspect ratio of @xmath199 when @xmath190 is adopted . it would not be trivial , if not impossible , for such structure to be induced in merger events in clusters . or the relic may actually consist of a number of substructures , which is hinted by the variations in the observed flux profile along the arc in the plane of the sky .",

    "the two models shown are the same except the existence of pre - existing cr electrons in m2b2.3s5.4 model . in m2b2.3s5.4 ,",
    "the `` re - accelerated '' population dominates over the `` injected '' population . yet",
    ", the two models give similar profiles of @xmath206 and @xmath135 .",
    "we see that in our models @xmath207 gives good fits to the observed profiles of @xmath206 and @xmath135 , while @xcite argued that @xmath208 seems to give a reasonable fit .",
    "note that they adopted @xmath209 and @xmath210 , giving @xmath211 kpc , while in our models @xmath212 and @xmath213 , giving @xmath214 kpc .    for the assumed value of @xmath193 , the postshock cr electron number fraction required to match the peak flux of 5 mjy is @xmath215 for m2b2.3i , which is six times larger than @xmath216 for m2b2.3s5.4 .",
    "this is because the spectral shapes of cr electron spectrum below @xmath157 are different in the two models ( see fig . 1 and discussion in the previous subsection ) .",
    "the number fraction of cr electrons for m2b2.3i seems too large , considering that the postshock proton cr number fraction is likely to be @xmath97 for @xmath217 @xcite . in m2b2.3s5.4 ,",
    "on the other hand , the ratio of upstream cr electrons pressure to gas pressure is @xmath218 .",
    "this seems to be marginal , that is , not inconsistent with expected values , considering that the ratio of cr proton pressure to gas pressure is @xmath219 in icms as noted in introduction .",
    "but we should point that the values of @xmath99 and @xmath80 in these two models are dominated by low - energy cr electrons with @xmath220 ( see figure 1 ) , which do not contribute much to the synchrotron radiation observed in radio relics .",
    "so if the `` injected '' population in m2b2.3i consists of electrons with @xmath221 only , the required values of @xmath99 could be reduced by a factor of @xmath10 , easing down the constraint . since we do not understand fully the plasma interactions involved in the pre - acceleration and injection of electrons at the shock , the detailed spectral shape of those low energy electrons are very uncertain .",
    "the top panels of figure 5 show the profiles of the intensity , @xmath222 , at 6 cm ( 5 ghz ) , 20 cm ( 1.5 ghz ) , and 91 cm ( 0.33 ghz ) in arbitrary units as a function of @xmath177 for the m4.5b3.5i , m2b7s4.2 and m2b2.3i models . here , the projection angle is set to be @xmath207 . since the emissivity @xmath167 decreases downstream of the shock , while the path length increases with @xmath177 , the profiles of @xmath223 exhibit non - monotonic behaviors .",
    "for example , the profiles at 6 cm show a slightly concave turnover before it decreases abruptly at @xmath224 kpc .",
    "the middle panels show the spectral indices , @xmath225 ( solid lines ) calculated between 6 and 20 cm and @xmath226 ( dashed lines ) calculated between 20 and 91 cm , when the projection angle is set to be @xmath190 , @xmath189 and @xmath205 . the general trend is the increase of @xmath225 and @xmath226 as we move away from the projected shock edge at @xmath227 , reflecting the effects of radiative cooling . also @xmath228 , that is , the slope is steeper at higher frequencies .",
    "the bottom panels show the color - color diagram of @xmath226 versus @xmath229 .",
    "the rightmost point ( @xmath230 ) corresponds to the projected shock edge .",
    "away from the edge , the loci move towards the lower left direction . in both middle and bottom panels ,",
    "the spectral slopes also show a slightly concave turnover for large projection angles of @xmath231 and @xmath205 .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the color - color diagram for the so - called `` toothbrush '' relic in cluster 1rxs j0603.3 + 4214 , which shows a spectral behavior that is consistent with the cooled electron population downstream of the shock .",
    "in an effort to refine our understandings of radio relics in clusters of galaxies , we have performed time - dependent , dsa simulations of cr electrons and calculated the synchrotron emission from cr electrons for plane - parallel shocks .",
    "the energy losses due to synchrotron and ic have been explicitly included .",
    "weak shocks expected to be found in icms have been considered .",
    "both the cases with and without pre - existing cr electrons have been considered .",
    "the relevant physics of dsa and cooling is well represented by plane - parallel shocks , since the time scales over which electrons are accelerated and cool are much shorter than the lifetime of merger shocks in clusters and the radio emission is confined to a region of small width behind the shock front .",
    "we then have modeled the synchrotron flux and spectral distributions from spherical shocks by approximating them with plane - parallel shocks and projecting to the plane of the sky for the angle from @xmath170 to @xmath171 along the los . for the specific models which are designed to reproduce radio relics in clusters",
    "ciza j2242.8 + 5301 and zwcl0008.8 + 5215 , we have compared the resulting distributions with observed ones in details .",
    "\\1 ) the cr electron spectrum becomes steady , after the dsa gains balance the radiative losses .",
    "the spectrum at the shock location is well approximated by a distribution with super - exponential cutoff at @xmath88 , @xmath232 .",
    "the full expressions of @xmath18 and @xmath88 are given in equations ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ peq ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) the spectrum of the downstream cr electrons that have cooled for the advection time , @xmath233 , can be approximated with @xmath234 $ ] at the distance @xmath235 from the shock location .",
    "here , @xmath236 is the functional form of the spectrum at the shock location of @xmath237 .",
    "the synchrotron emission from this analytic formula provides a reasonable approximation to that calculated using dsa simulation results ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "\\3 ) both the models of @xmath238 shock without pre - existing cr electrons and @xmath217 shock with pre - existing cr electrons of @xmath239 may explain the observed properties of the radio relic in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 .",
    "the postshock electron cr number fraction of @xmath240 in the injection - only model or the ratio of upstream cr electrons pressure to gas pressure of @xmath241 in the model with pre - existing crs are required to explain the observed radio flux of several mjy .",
    "those values of @xmath99 and @xmath80 are modest enough to be accommodated in typical clusters .",
    "but the surface of the shock responsible for the relic should be highly elongated with the aspect ratio of @xmath242 .",
    "it would not be trivial for such structure to be induced in merger events in clusters .",
    "\\4 ) the radio relic in zwcl0008.8 + 5215 may be explained by the models of @xmath217 shock with or without pre - existing cr electrons .",
    "however , in the injection - only model , @xmath243 , required to explain the observed radio flux of several mjy , is probably too large for the weak shock of @xmath217 . on the other hand , in the model with pre - existing crs , @xmath244 , required to explain the observed flux , seems to be marginal , that is , not inconsistent with expected values in clusters . in the model ,",
    "then , the origin of such pre - existing electron population is an important topic , but beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "\\5 ) the color - color diagram of @xmath226 vs @xmath229 has been presented behind the projected shock edge .",
    "it includes an important information about the evolutionary properties of the postshock electrons . due to the effect of the projection with limited subtended angle along the los for spherical shocks",
    ", the diagram behaves differently for different projection angles .",
    "so it may provide an independent way to estimate the projection angle , which is a key parameter in modeling of radio relics .",
