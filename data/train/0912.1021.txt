    "at the end of inflation the universe is extremely cold and all of its energy is concentrated in the inflaton field @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the reheating stage is a key ingredient to connect a successful inflationary stage into hot big bang cosmology . in simplest models of inflation , such as chaotic inflation models",
    ", inflaton field oscillates coherently around the minimum of the potential with amplitude close to the planck mass , @xmath8 .",
    ", for @xmath9 being the newton constant . ]",
    "to transfer the energy from the background inflaton field and reheat the universe one has to consider its coupling to other fields , such as the standard model fields .",
    "due to coherent oscillations of the background inflaton field around the potential minimum , explosive particle creation can happen via parametric resonance which can drag most of the energy from the inflaton field and reheat the universe @xcite .",
    "preheating , the stage of explosive particle creation via parametric resonance , is a non - perturbative effect and the produced particles are highly non - thermal .",
    "subsequent turbulent interactions of different modes and re - scatterings would bring an end to preheating and thermalization starts @xcite where the perturbative reheating mechanism may start @xcite . for",
    "a review of preheating see @xcite and references therein .",
    "there have been many studies of preheating via four - legs interaction @xmath10 between the inflaton field and the resonance field @xmath3 in expanding or flat backgrounds .",
    "one disadvantage of @xmath10 preheating channel is that the decay of inflaton in an expanding background is not complete and the inhomogeneous inflaton particles will dominate with the matter equation of state , an unsatisfactory state to end ( p)reheating with .    in order to enhance the preheating mechanism other interactions are necessary , specially once the inflaton field amplitude is damped while oscillating around its minimum .",
    "the simplest and the most natural of these interactions is the trilinear interaction @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant of dimension of mass . the implications of trilinear interaction for the chaotic inflationary potential @xmath13 was studied in @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect of preheating via trilinear interaction is that during half period of its oscillation , the inflaton field changes sign and the time - dependent frequency squared for the @xmath3 particle creation becomes negative for small enough mode wavelengths .",
    "this tachyonic instability enhances the preheating mechanism significantly and in @xcite was dubbed as `` tachyonic resonance '' .",
    "the analysis of @xcite were mainly devoted to a flat background and the effects of tachyonic resonance in an expanding background was briefly considered , incorporating them `` adiabatically '' .",
    "the tachyonic effect of a trilinear interaction was used in @xcite , in the context of cosmological moduli problem and the idea of tachyonic parametric resonance with a negative coupling constant was also exploited in @xcite .",
    "here we consider the tachyonic resonance preheating in @xmath14 and @xmath13 inflationary potentials in an expanding universe .",
    "our main interest will be in the @xmath14 theory but we extend the results of @xcite for @xmath13 inflationary model to an expanding background .",
    "the preheating with four - leg interaction within the @xmath14 inflation theory was studied extensively in @xcite . due to the conformal invariance of the inflationary potential ,",
    "the effects of expanding background can be absorbed by a conformal transformation and one is basically dealing with preheating in a minkowski background .",
    "however , with the addition of @xmath11 interaction , the conformal invariance is broken explicitly and the methods employed in @xcite should now be modified .",
    "breaking of conformal invariance results in an explicit breaking of periodicity in @xmath3-modes equation : the amplitude of the source term in @xmath3 field particle creation grows linearly with the dimensionless conformal time @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the standard floquet theorem does not apply .",
    "this leads to the interesting result that the number density of @xmath3 particles produced at momentum @xmath15 , @xmath16 , grows as @xmath17 for some constant @xmath18 .",
    "this should be compared with the standard result of the preheating due to a periodic source term , where @xmath16 has a linear exponential growth as dictated by the floquet theorem .",
    "another interesting result of our analysis is that we present an analytic method to compute the interference term which accounts for the phase difference between the @xmath3 fields during each period of the @xmath7 field oscillation .",
    "the phase accumulated during certain number of oscillations , which we compute , makes the @xmath3 particle creation to be destructive for certain modes , the @xmath19 of which we specify .",
    "this causes some ripples on the @xmath6 curve in the @xmath20 diagram.this result is to be compared with the stochastic nature of the phases in the four - leg preheating scenarios @xcite .",
    "while our main interest is in @xmath14 inflationary theory , we also study the effect of expanding background on @xmath13 theory .",
    "as one may expect , the effect of expanding background will generally suppress the preheating efficiency .",
    "as we demonstrate , however , it actually enhances the preheating for some certain modes .    as the number of @xmath3 particles grow their back - reaction on the dynamics of the particle production and the @xmath7 field dynamics become important , slowing down the preheating and eventually terminating it . for a successful preheating model",
    "it is necessary that this back reaction does not become large too early , before the energy of the inflaton field is completely transferred into the @xmath7 or @xmath3 particles .",
    "it is also important that in the end of preheating we remain with a relativistic ensemble of these particle . as in the case of @xmath21 , which has been analyzed in @xcite",
    ", our analysis shows that the trilinear interactions seems to lead to a more efficient preheating than the four - leg case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ phi4-case ]",
    "we study in details the tachyonic resonance for @xmath14 theory .",
    "we demonstrate that our analytical results agree very well with the exact numerical results . in section [ m2phi2-case ]",
    "we repeat the analysis of tachyonic resonance for @xmath13 theory in an expanding background . in section [ back - reaction ]",
    "we study the effects of @xmath3-particles back - reactions on the preheating and estimate the time preheating ends .",
    "a summary of the results are given in section [ summary ] .",
    "some technical aspects of the analysis are relegated into * appendices [ acn]-[r+jacobicn]*.",
    "as explained above , we are mainly interested in tachyonic resonance in @xmath14 inflationary theory with the trilinear interaction @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a parameter with dimension of mass . as in @xcite",
    "we have to include the self - interaction @xmath22 to uplift the potential and keep it bounded from below .",
    "the total potential is [ v - eq ] v&= & ^4 + ^2 + ^4 + + & = & ( - ) ^2 + ( ^2 + ) ^2 .",
    "the potential has a global minimum at @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the last term in ( [ v - eq ] ) is added to lift the global minimum to zero . in order to make sure that this constant value does not contribute to the inflationary dynamics",
    ", we require that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the value of the inflaton field at the end of inflation when the onset of preheating starts with @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to [ cond1 ] 1 .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath3-field is heavy during inflation and is settled down to its minimum at @xmath28 this requires that @xmath29 , which can be satisfied if @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial value of the inflaton field at the start of inflation . for inflation to solve the flatness and the horizon problem , we require that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "so the assumption that the field @xmath3 would be stabilized to its minima requires that [ cond2 ] 10 ^ 2 .",
    "however , it is also possible that the field @xmath3 is light during inflation which can then contribute to iso - curvature perturbations .    to study the preheating with trilinear interaction , we review the background of @xcite where the parametric resonance with four - legs interaction for @xmath14 theory was investigated . as in @xcite , performing the conformal transformation @xmath34 the background equation for the @xmath35 field to a very good approximation is simplified to [ phi - eq ]  + ^3 = 0 , where the derivatives are with respect to the conformal time @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scale factor . the solution to this equation",
    "is given in terms of jacobi elliptic cosine function = f(x ) , where @xmath38 is the amplitude of the oscillations at the onset of preheating which we take to be @xmath39 , and the dimensionless conformal time @xmath5 is defined by [ x - def ] x = ( ) ^1/4 .",
    "the jacobi elliptic cosine function satisfies the relation @xmath40 with the solution denoted by f(x ) = cn(x , ) .",
    "the function @xmath41 is a periodic function with the periodicity [ periodt]t4 k(1/2 ) 7.416 where @xmath42 represents the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . for a review of jacobi elliptic cosine function see * appendix [ acn]*.",
    "one also notes that the following relations also hold [ background ] a ( ) = =  x  , t = ^2 .    ignoring the back - reaction of the produced @xmath3 particles , performing the conformal transformation @xmath43 , and using the background equations ( [ background ] ) , the equation for the mode function @xmath44 in the momentum space is [ x - eq ]  _ + ( ^2 + p x f(x ) ) _ = 0 , where the derivatives are now with respect to the dimensionless conformal time @xmath5 given in ( [ x - def ] ) , and ^2= , p ( ) . in writing we have ignored the @xmath28 and @xmath45 terms , associated with the minima of the potential .",
    "the effects of non - zero values for @xmath28 and @xmath45 will appear in as the shift in @xmath46 by an amount of the order @xmath47 ( and similarly for the @xmath48 term ) , causing an error of the order @xmath49 , which using it is much smaller than one .",
    "before we start the analytical theory of tachyonic resonance , we need to estimate the magnitude of parameter @xmath46 .",
    "this in turn is determined by the conditions whether the field @xmath3 is heavy or light during inflation .",
    "if we assume that the field @xmath3 is heavy during inflation , then the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) indicates that @xmath50 .",
    "however , if we assume that the field @xmath3 is light during inflation , which is our preferred choice , then ( [ cond1 ] ) can be used to estimate the bound on @xmath46 . writing ( [ cond1 ] ) in the form @xmath51 , we see that for natural choice of @xmath52 , @xmath53 . on the other hand , for @xmath54 , the bound on @xmath46 may become relaxed .",
    "we present our analytical results for arbitrary value of @xmath46 .",
    "however , for numerical examples we shall consider the cases @xmath55 and @xmath56 for illustrations .    equation ( [ x - eq ] ) represents a harmonic oscillator with the time dependent frequency [ omega ] ^2 ( x ) ^2 + p x f(x ) = ^2 + p x cn(x , ) .",
    "a plot of @xmath57 is given in * fig .",
    "[ rfx]*. we see that @xmath58 is not periodic and its maximum value is increasing linearly with the conformal time @xmath5 . consequently , the floquet theorem for particle creation via parametric resonance with a periodic source does not apply .",
