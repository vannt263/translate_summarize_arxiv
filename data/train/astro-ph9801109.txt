    "hard x - ray spectral observations of solar flares made in past 20 years have established that efficient electron acceleration ( @xmath1 electrons s@xmath2 ) occurs during impulsive solar flares ( lin & hudson 1971 ) .",
    "the _ yohkoh _ hard x - ray telescope clearly showed that almost all flares have double footpoint sources , the signature of bombardment by the accelerated electrons into the dense chromosphere ( hoyng et al .",
    "1981 , sakao et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) . these spectral and imaging observations showed that rich amount of non - thermal electrons were accelerated somewhere in the system , and were injected in the soft x - ray loop , which turned out to be the reconnected field lines filled with evaporated plasma ( tsuneta 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , a surprising discovery from the hxt is the detection of an impulsive hard x - ray source located above the soft x - ray loop ( masuda et al .",
    "the overall time profile of the loop - top source is similar to those from the footpoints , implying common origin of acceleration .",
    "see miller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a review of these recent observations and the theoretical implications .    _",
    "yohkoh _ soft x - ray observations , on the other hand , strongly suggest that magnetic reconnection serves as an efficient engine to convert magnetic energy to plasma kinetic and thermal energies ( tsuneta 1996 ) . in this process , mhd slow - mode shocks attached to the reconnection x - point appear to convert magnetic energy , brought with the inflow to the x - point from the vast active region corona , to plasma heating and an outflow jet with the alfvn speed on the upstream side .",
    "the outflow jet can form a fast - mode shock ( quasi - perpendicular shock ) to further heat the plasma ( masuda et al .",
    "1994 , shibata et al .",
    "1995 , tsuneta et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the observed geometry indicated that the loop - top hard x - ray source was located at the downstream side of reconnection site ( below the x - point ) .",
    "this implied that the formation of the loop - top source was related to the fast shock , regardless of whether it was of thermal or non - thermal origin ( tsuneta et al .",
    "furthermore , the electron spectra of the loop - top hard x - ray source turned out to be more consistent with the power - law with differential power index of 24 ( alexander & metcalf 1997 ) .",
    "aschwanden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concluded from their innovative time - of - flight method that the acceleration site of this flare must have been located around the loop - top hard x - ray source or above , if the acceleration site was spatially concentrated .",
    "all these three independent approaches point to the loop - top hard x - ray source as the acceleration site .    in this letter , we suggest that the electron acceleration and the resultant formation of the loop - top hard x - ray source are natural consequences of the new mhd framework being established by the _",
    "yohkoh _ soft x - ray observations : the highly oblique fast shock sandwiched by the slow shocks provides an ideal site for electron acceleration with the first - order shock fermi acceleration ( eg",
    ". blandford & eichler 1987 ; jones & ellison , 1991 ) .",
    "there are four stringent requirements from the observations to quantitatively examine whether first - order fermi acceleration is viable in the 10100 kev electron acceleration .",
    "\\(1 ) since the background plasma density is high in the solar corona , the acceleration rate has to exceed the collisional loss at the thermal energy of the background plasma .",
    "the net acceleration rate is given by @xmath3 where the first term on the right hand side is the acceleration rate and the second term the collisional energy loss .",
    "the net acceleration rate has to be positive at the thermal energy of the background plasma .",
    "( 2 ) the energy gain has to be high enough to explain the loop - top hard x - ray source , that is observed at @xmath0 50 kev .",
    "( if the loop - top source provides electrons responsible for the footpoint hard x - rays , the energy has to reach @xmath4100 kev . )",
    "electrons , therefore , have to be accelerated within a relatively short time , over which an oblique ( quasi - perpendicular ) field line crosses the fast shock structure . ( 3 ) acceleration takes place on a time scale of impulsive bursts , which is about 1s or faster .",
    "( 4 ) number of accelerated electrons is consistent with number of accelerated electrons deduced from observations ( 10@xmath5 electrons s@xmath2 . )      in this paper , we call the energy , at which the net energy gain rate [ eq . ( 1 ) ]",
    "equals zero , the injection energy .",
    "although the injection energy is defined with regard both to energy loss and particle scattering , we assume that there exists sufficient magnetic field turbulence such as whistler waves to be able to scatter the electrons with energies exceeding 1 kev ( eg .",
    "melrose 1986 , melrose 1994 ) .",
    "[ these waves can energize electrons ( eg . miller et al .",
    "we , however , do not include these alternative acceleration processes such as resonance acceleration and dc electric acceleration in this analysis . ]    the collisional energy loss in eq.(1 ) is estimated to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the background electron density in unit of 10@xmath8 @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the electron energy in kev ( eg .",
    "jackson 1975 ) . in the scheme of shock acceleration ,",
    "the acceleration rate is derived from energy gain @xmath11 and required time @xmath12 per each shock crossing , and represented by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ( energy - independent ) diffusion length measured along the field line , @xmath15 the upstream speed with respect to the downstream speed , and @xmath16 the angle between the fast shock normal and the field line crossing the shock(fig .",
    ", we apply @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an electron velocity ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 is the enhancement factor originating from the obliqueness of the shock . assuming an isotropic electron distribution , we apply @xmath21 . in the standard shock acceleration theory , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the diffusion coefficient and flow speed in the upstream ( downstream ) , respectively .",
    "the time during which a particular field line crosses the fast shock is @xmath25",
    ". the crossing time decreases with increasing obliqueness . from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the energy gain is given by @xmath26 for particles with energy above the injection energy .",
    "we simply represent the diffusion length as a parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we adopt @xmath16 as another parameter expressing obliqueness of the shock .",
    "it is proposed that the efficiency of shock acceleration is boosted due to the obliqueness ( jokipii 1987 , naito & takahara 1995a , 1995b and references therein ) .",
    "2 shows that the injection energy rapidly decreases with increasing obliqueness . here ,",
    "we adopt the following values from the observations ; the density of the background plasma @xmath27 @xmath9 , the temperature @xmath28 k ( tsuneta et al . 1997 ) , the length of the fast shock @xmath29 km , which is the width of the loop - top hard x - ray source ( masuda et al . 1984 ) .",
    "we assume the diffusion length @xmath30 , which will be estimated later to satisfy the observational and theoretical requirements .",
    "the speed of the outflow from the reconnection region is equal to the alfvn velocity of the upstream side ( petschek 1964 ) , and is taken to be @xmath31 km s@xmath2 ( tsuneta 1996 ) .",
    "the number of accelerated electrons critically depends on the injection energy with respect to the thermal energy of the background plasma . here",
    ", we conservatively assume that the injection energy is equal to the thermal energy of the background plasma heated by the slow shocks ( @xmath0 2 kev ) , implying bulk electron acceleration , though higher injection energy resulting in acceleration of tail electrons in the thermal distribution function may be acceptable .",
    "the initial energy of electrons @xmath32 is , therefore , 2 kev , which is accepted as the injection energy for @xmath33 deg as shown in fig .",
    "2 . combining with the electron energy at the loop - top hard x - ray source of about 100 kev , we assume that the energy gain of 50 or more is necessary .",
    "since the diffusion ( scattering ) length @xmath14 and the shock angle @xmath16 are parameters that can not be directly determined from the observations , we obtain the two parameters from the following two conditions to satisfy the first two requirements in section 2.1 ; @xmath34 @xmath35 fig .",
    "3 shows @xmath36 at @xmath37 and @xmath38kev , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the @xmath41 space .",
    "the following two additional conditions have to be satisfied to choose the proper diffusion length @xmath14 : ( 1 ) the length must be comparable to or be larger than the diffusion length derived from the assumption of the bohm diffusion ( eg .",
    "kirk 1994 ) .",
    "it is customarily expressed by using bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath42 as @xmath43 km for @xmath44kev and @xmath45 g where the factor @xmath46 is anticipated to be in the range of @xmath47 from recent observations in interplanetary shocks ( kang & jones 1997 ; baring et al .",
    "1997 ) . since scattering by whistler waves in transient phenomena such as solar flares is poorly understood , we conservatively assume @xmath48 , and the diffusion length @xmath49 .",
    "( 2 ) the length must be smaller than the distance between the slow shocks ( @xmath50 ) , which contain the electrons , thus @xmath51 km .",
    "these conditions given above are met when the shock is highly oblique ( @xmath52 degree ) .",
    "the diffusion length in this case is about @xmath53 km .",
    "the diffusion length @xmath14 needs to be shorter for higher energy gain .",
    "for instance , @xmath54 km and @xmath55 degree are needed to accelerated electrons to 1 mev from 2 kev .",
    "since the required diffusion length logarithmically depends on the energy gain @xmath56 , we need the diffusion length of 270 km to accelerate electrons to 10 mev from 2 kev , 230 km to 50 mev from 2 kev for the same shock angle @xmath57 degree .",
    "the acceleration to ultra - high energy may be feasible , if we assume an energy - independent diffusion length .",
    "the entire acceleration time for @xmath58 degree is @xmath59 0.6 - 0.3 s , which is consistent with the time scale of the intensity fluctuation of the impulsive hard x - ray bursts , satisfying the third requirement in section 2.1 .",
    "the forth requirement will be discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "fermi acceleration has often been proposed to explain electron acceleration in solar flares ( eg .",
    "bai 1983 , ellison & ramaty 1985 , somov & kosugi 1997 ; first - order fermi acceleration , ramaty 1979 , larosa , moore , & shore 1994 ; second - order fermi acceleration ) .",
    "however , one of the principal problems associated with the first and second - order fermi acceleration is the high injection energy of about 20100 kev ( bai 1983 , ramaty 1979 ) . the oblique shock configuration can drastically decrease the injection energy . nevertheless , the injection energy is still higher than the energy corresponding to the coronal temperatures ( 13mk ) , and it may not be possible to accelerate electrons from the coronal plasma , unless we assume a very small diffusion length .",
    "[ there is no injection problem with some versions of the stochastic acceleration ( larosa , moore , & shore , 1994 , and miller , larosa , & moore , 1996 ) . ]      here , we point out that recent _ yohkoh _ observations open up the new possibility to accelerate electrons with first - order fermi acceleration : ( 1 ) reconnection may produce a fast outflow with speed exceeding the local sound speed .",
    "( the sound speed is much faster than the alfvn speed in the outflow . )",
    "thus , it can produce a fast shock , providing the site for first - order fermi acceleration .",
    "( 2 ) magnetic field - line structure of the reconnection site naturally creates a highly oblique shock .",
    "( the magnetic field lines are almost parallel to the fast shock . )",
    "( 3 ) the outflow from the reconnection site is heated upto 1020mk by the slow shocks ( tsuneta 1996 )",
    ". therefore , the plasma temperature can reach the injection energy , and the bulk thermal plasma can be accelerated .",
    "( 4 ) the acceleration site is bounded by the two facing slow shocks , so that electrons that escape in the upstream side during the course of acceleration most probably return to the fast shock due to the magnetic mirror by the slow shocks , subject to further acceleration .",
    "the electrons escaping in the downstream side also returns the shock front , and continue to be accelerated ( fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , the fast shock bounded by the two slow shocks may provide an escape - free accelerator .",
    "indeed , we have shown that when the shock is oblique enough ( @xmath60 degree ) , the electrons can be accelerated with energy gain @xmath61 in 0.30.6 s. the injection energy can be low enough so that bulk acceleration from the thermal pool appears to be feasible .",
    "the diffusion length @xmath14 is safely as large as 600 km .",
    "although we have assumed an energy - independent diffusion , the conclusion here is essentially the same as the energy - dependent case .    if the shock angle deviates to below about 80 degrees , then the injection energy exceeds the thermal energy of the background plasma , resulting in the significant reduction of the number of accelerated electrons ( unless we assume smaller diffusion length ) .",
    "the shock angle is not likely to be uniform due to non - uniform high-@xmath62 outflow in the upstream side of the fast shock ( tsuneta 1996 ) .",
    "the variety of flares from purely thermal flares to flares with highly non - thermal nature may be related to this .      since there is no plasma density enhancement in the loop - top hard x - ray source , the loop - top hard x - rays",
    "are essentially emitted from the thick target process ( brown 1972 ) .",
    "the column density @xmath63 [ @xmath64 to stop electrons with energy @xmath10 [ kev ] is given by @xmath65 .",
    "the column density required to stop @xmath10 = 50 kev electrons is @xmath66 @xmath67 , and the electrons have to bounce 100200 times in the loop - top hard x - ray source ( tsuneta et al .",
    "1997 , wheatland & melrose 1995 ) .",
    "it takes about 510s to completely thermalize the accelerated electrons .",
    "this dissipation time scale is much longer than the acceleration time scale at the fast shock ( 0.30.6 s ) .",
    "the loss cone angle for the slow shocks is about 14 degrees for @xmath68 g ( field strength of the upstream of the slow shock ) and @xmath69 g ( downstream of the slow shock ) ( tsuneta et al .",
    "thus , the slow shocks can provide an efficient confinement mechanism .",
    "these considerations indicate that the fast shock is located above the loop - top hard x - ray source , and that the slow shock extends downward below the fast shock to confine the non - thermal electrons .",
    "the accelerated electrons are carried downward with slow outflow downstream of the fast shock , and emit hard x - rays as long as they are confined with the slow shock .",
    "they are no longer trapped outside the slow shock region .",
    "the electrons are then immediately released toward the footpoints , and may form the simultaneous double - source hard x - ray structure at the footpoints of the reconnected field lines .",
    "masuda ( 1994 ) reported that @xmath70 electrons s@xmath2 are accelerated during the peak phase of the 1992 january 13 flare ( masuda 1994 ) .",
    "the reconnection outflow to the fast shock supplies thermal electrons with rate @xmath71 electrons s@xmath2 , so that the reconnection outflow can provide enough seed electrons to be accelerated .",
    "although acceleration efficiency is expected to be very high as discussed above , we need more detailed modeling with monte carlo simulation to obtain the spectra of the accelerated electrons , and to answer whether the forth requirement described in section 2.1 is met .",
    "this is left to our future work ."
