    "the observational properties of dust and the physical consequences of its presence in the interstellar medium and extremely well - known and well - documented @xcite .",
    "however its composition , structure and size - distribution are still subjects of much discussion .",
    "even though there are no direct samples of interstellar dust , carbonaceous dust deposits found in meteorites give us an indication of what structure and composition we might expect .",
    "these grains consist of a core of microcrystalline aromatic moieties surrounded by a crystalline graphite mantle @xcite .",
    "significantly , the precise chemical kinetic pathways leading to the ( relatively simple ) case of carbon - dust formation are almost entirely speculative .",
    "the recent observations of higher than expected dust masses around high redshift quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and local supernovae @xcite , has caused a resurgence of interest in the issues of dust formation mechansims and efficiencies . in the local universe , dust is observed mainly in two environments : dense interstellar clouds and circumstellar media .",
    "the main sources of interstellar dust are believed to be evolved red giants , novae and supernovae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "there are thus two questions that we address in this paper : ( i ) what is the chemical pathway for the formation of macromolecular species that leads to the formation of dust nucleation sites",
    "? , and ( ii ) what range of physical parameters determine the viability of these pathways ?    for the sake of ( relative ) simplicity we limit our discussion to the formation of carbon dust in carbon - rich circumstellar environments , making the simplifying assumption that the oxygen is completely locked up in the relatively inert form of co. in such an environment the c@xmath1o ratio - 1 is thus a crucial parameter .",
    "however , it should be noted ( see below ) that this usually - assumed approximation has been challenged by relatively recent observational and modelling efforts .",
    "some of the earliest attempts at modelling carbon dust formation concentrated on novae , some of which are seen to produce very optically thick ( carbon ) dust shells on timescales of days .",
    "@xcite developed a proto - pdr model of the chemistry in novae ejectae , and found that molecule formation requires the presence of h@xmath0 and carbon neutrality ( ci ) .",
    "the presence of c@xmath2 ( and the carbon ionization continuum ) inhibits molecule formation .",
    "chemical equilibrium is established very fast ( within @xmath3s ) .",
    "@xcite , hereafter rw89 , extended this and proposed a non - lte chemical kinetic model of ( carbon ) dust formation in novae ejectae which proceeds via a limited hydrocarbon chemistry - totally dominated by the photophysics , and requiring all oxygen to be locked up in co. this latter finding has been challenged - both by the observations that suggest that carbon dust is formed in oxygen rich ( o@xmath4c ) environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - and also models of the chemistry in nova outflows ( @xcite ) . in these models c@xmath0",
    "( for which the more significant of the two pre - dissociation bands is shielded against photodissociation in a ci region ) is the key building block species , rather than c@xmath0h@xmath0 which is susceptible to photodissociation . as such ,",
    "nucleation of dust was found to be possible only in a ci region , but requires some source of ionization to drive the chemistry .",
    "@xcite extended the work by rw89 by including oxygen and nitrogen chemistry and updated the photoreaction rates .",
    "surprisingly , they found that the overall chemistry is not as dependent on the photochemistry as earlier studies had suggested and that carbon dust could be formed even when all of the oxygen is not ` locked ' in co. the work highlighted that cn , co and c@xmath0 are key molecular species in the formation pathways of larger species .",
    "although c@xmath0h@xmath0 was included its chemistry was not closely scrutinised .",
    "more generally , it has been proposed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) are key intermediates in carbon dust formation and act as nucleation sites for dust grains ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this inferred link is due to the the close relationship between the molecular structure of pahs and the carbon structure of graphite .",
    "also , observations of the far - ir continuum due to carbon dust are accompanied by strong pah features @xcite .",
    "however , some caution should be exercised with the interpretation of these features .",
    "for example , pah ( and/or hydrogenated amorphous carbon ) emission is also detected in some carbon - dust producing novae but in all cases it is only seen well _ after _ dust formation and in an environment when it would be susceptible to photodissociation .",
    "this indicates that - for novae at least - the pahs are transitory products of dust destruction , rather than intermediates to dust formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed chemical mechanisms required to form pah molecules in stellar winds . the acetylene molecule ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 )",
    "was found to be crucial in the formation pathway .",
    "an important contribution came from @xcite , hereafter ( ff89 ) .",
    "they investigated a mechanism of pah formation , using a chemical kinetic approach .",
    "the chemistry network was based on soot production in terrestrial hydrocarbon flames , which they applied to astrophysical conditions , i.e. much lower pressure and densities .",
    "they confirmed that the complex network of chemical reactions can essentially be described by a sequence of hydrogen abstraction followed by acetylene addition .",
    "acetylene does not possess a permanent dipole moment and so does not have a rotational spectrum observable at radio wavelemgths .",
    "it is therefore somewhat elusive ; - detections rely on rovibrational transitions , observable in the mid - infrared .",
    "for this reason , detections tend to be limited to the warm gas ( @xmath5k ) along the lines of sight towards young stellar objects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is also strong evidence for the presence of c@xmath0h@xmath0 in evolved carbon stars ; the most well known of which - irc+10216 - exhibits a forest of c@xmath0h@xmath0 lines in the 11 - 14@xmath6 m window ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , after h@xmath0 and co , c@xmath0h@xmath0 is determined to be the most abundant species in the gas - with a fractional abundance of @xmath7 - although this is primarily detected _ outside _ the dust - formation zone and so is not necessarily associated with the dust - formation process .",
    "there may even be some evidence of c@xmath0h@xmath0 freeze - out into icy mantles at larger radii in irc+10216 , and an icy mantle - based origin for interstellar c@xmath0h@xmath0 is strongly suggested by spitzer observations of the correlation between c@xmath0h@xmath0 and gas - phase co@xmath0 towards cepheus a east ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite addressed the issue of pah chemistry and dust formation in the carbon - rich envelopes of late agb stars ; driven by stellar pulstations and ( strong , density enhancing ) shocks .",
    "although extremely dense , the gas is much cooler and not subject to the intense fuv radiation field that is present in a nova , so the chemical model was based on a terrestrial neutral gas acetylenic - burning soot chemistry . in such environments the carbon budget is largely split between co and c@xmath0h@xmath0 .",
    "the chemistry was largely based on well - studied flame chemistries ( eg .",
    "ff89 ) , expanded and augmented to include free radicals .",
    "it was found that c@xmath0h@xmath0 is the key species in macro - molecular growth and ( especially ) ring closure / cyclization to form aromatic hydrocarbon rings , as well as the polymerization to multiple ring pahs .",
    "the formation of the first aromatic ring is often recognised as the main ` bottleneck ' in macro - molecular growth / dust nucleation . in this ,",
    "as in later studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ring closure was found to proceed following reactions of two propargyl radicals ( c@xmath8h@xmath8 ) or via a lesser channel involving reaction of acetylene with 1,3 butadiyne ( c@xmath9h@xmath0 ) ( e.g. see figs .",
    "3 & 4 in that paper ) . in either case c@xmath0h@xmath0",
    "initiates the chemistry .",
    "reaction networks need to include both two - body and three - body reactions , but did not include photoreactions , or an ion - molecule chemistry .",
    "although they were able to identify the presence of a temperature window ( 900 - 1100k ) in which the formation of pahs is possible , the formation efficiency is too low - possibly due to the lack of inclusion of the effects of a local uv radiation field and/or an ion - molecule chemistry .    considering a different class of object",
    "@xcite modelled the formation of benzene ( c@xmath10h@xmath10 ) in a protoplanetary nebula ( crl618 ) where the chemistry is characterised by high densities , temperatures and ionization rates - although photoreactions were significantly inhibited throughout the molecule - formation zone due to the assumed presence of dust .",
    "this chemistry is somewhat different to the cherchneff et al .",
    "schemes due to the presence of a degree of ionization and an efficient ion - molecule chemistry .",
    "however , even in these conditions , c@xmath0h@xmath0 plays a crucial role - mainly through the initiating reaction of @xmath11 all of the above models and reaction schemes have made extremely simplistic assumptions about the radiation field and the photoreaction rates ; either by only considering the chemistry in low luminosity environments ( or external to an optically thick dust - formation zone ) - in which case they are ignored , or by simply ` scaling up ' interstellar photoreaction rates in a way that does not properly take into account the specific nature of the radiation field and/or the significance of ionization continua .",
    "the overall aim of this work is therefore to include an ion - molecule chemistry and a careful re - calculation of the photoreaction rates using local radiation fields and accurate cross - sectional data to re - assess the viability of c@xmath0h@xmath0 formation in a variety of carbon - rich circumstellar environments .",
    "as c@xmath0h@xmath0 is fundamental to the formation of pah molecules , we try to determine if the amount of c@xmath0h@xmath0 produced in carbon rich agb and nova environments is enough to seed dust formation .",
    "we use a specially adapted chemical network for high temperatures and densities , paying particular attention to a more accurate account of the photochemistry involved in non - interstellar conditions , which ( as explained above ) previously had been highly over - simplified .",
    "we investigate a broad range of dust - forming objects which includes carbon stars with effective temperatures higher than agb stars ( e.g. ch subgiants ) , novae and r coronae borealis stars . by doing this",
    "we aim to establish the range of parameter space within which effective c@xmath0h@xmath0 formation ( and by inference pah formation ) is possible .    in section ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the model that was implemented . section  [ sec : parameters ] specifies the physical and chemical parameters used for the three different carbon rich circumstellar environments that we have modelled .",
    "we describe the results and analysis in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] we summarise our results and their implications .",
    "the nucleation sites for dust grain formation are formed in the gas phase in a cooling , expanding atmosphere , such as in the outflow from a red giant @xcite .",
    "therefore if pahs are the key intermediate molecules to carbonaceous dust they should also be formed in the stellar winds that feed the circumstellar environment .",
    "we therefore model the time - dependent chemistry that occurs in an appropriately located gas parcel",
    ". this will be the part of the envelope whose temperature lies within the range that is appropriate for dust formation - corresponding to the ` condensation radius ' in previous studies ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as explained above , the main chemical pathway to form a pah molecule starts with the polymerization of c@xmath0h@xmath0 @xcite and we therefore identify acetylene as being the key molecule in the formation of larger species , such as pahs .",
    "we investigate the viability of acetylene formation as being the controlling factor in the formation of dust nucleation sites via pahs as intermediate macro - molecules .",
    "the gas in stellar outflows is dense ( n@xmath12@xmath13 ) and warm ( t@xmath14k ) , so that ( providing the gas is not _",
    "too _ hot , such that bond - breaking , collisional dissociation reactions can occur ) , molecules can be formed efficiently and quickly .",
    "as the gas expands and its density falls , the chemical reaction rates are quenched .",
    "however , the geometrical dilution timescale is typically many orders of magnitude larger than the chemical kinetic timescale ( @xcite ) and this is not a critical factor in determining the dust - formation efficiency . despite the possible presence of shocks etc . - and although the gas is very far from thermal equilibrium , the characteristic timescale of the outflow is much larger than the chemical kinetic timescale .",
    "we therefore assume that both the circumstellar environment and the stellar wind are spherically symmetric around the star and that the physical conditions ( density , temperature , radiation dilution factor etc . )",
    "are not time dependent and remain constant .",
    "the chemistry is evolved to chemical equilibrium which , as argued above , occurs on a timescale that is very much shorter than that for which changes in the physical conditions occur . in practice",
    ", equilibrium was determined from the requirement that the abundances of all species changed by @xmath15 on any time step and typically was achieved on timescales of seconds .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of the equilibrium abundances to the physical conditions .",
    "the key free parameters that we have varied are : the total abundances of the elements , the photospheric temperature of the star , the density and the temperature of the gas .",
    "other parameters , such as the dilution factor for the radiation field , are taken to be defined by the observed location of dust formation .",
    "the elemental abundances are given in table  4 .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rate is set to @xmath16s@xmath17 , which is representative of the assumed galactic background rate @xcite .",
    "the chemical network includes 1537 reactions between 102 gas - phase species involving 8 elements ( h , he , c , n , o , s , na and si ) .",
    "these are listed in table  1 .",
    ".chemical species [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ tab : nova ]    it has long been established that dust is sometimes formed , rapidly and efficiently , in nova outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the most extreme circumstances ,",
    "a steep decrease in the visual emission occurs , accompanied by a strong rise in thermal infrared emission - as an optically thick dust shell is formed @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the following relations between the physical parameters : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rate of magnitude decline in the optical , @xmath20 is the initial photospheric radius , @xmath21 is the nova luminosity and @xmath22 is the number of days post outburst .",
    "the values for the rate of visual decline from maximum ( @xmath23 mag d@xmath17 ) and time at start of calculation ( @xmath22= 30 days post outburst ) were adopted following @xcite .",
    "novae can be classed by the time taken for a nova to diminish by 2 magnitudes below maximum visual brightness .",
    "generally , ` slower ' novae ( i.e. those with smaller values of @xmath24 ) are more effective at producing optically thick shells of carbon dust . parameters for a typical dust - producing nova are given in table  5 and are used in our model .",
    "the parameter range investigated and initial conditions are given in the table  4 .",
    "the fractional abundance of carbon is much higher than in the case of agb stars @xcite .",
    "this is due to the thermonuclear processing of the gas and dredge - up of white dwarf material that occurs following the thermonuclear runaway that drives the nova outburst .",
    "the upper limit of density was inferred from observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we investigate stars with photospheric temperatures in the range 37506000k .",
    "low mass main sequence stars are not likely to have a high c@xmath1o ratio . however , ch subgiants are low luminosity peculiar giants , which have a high c@xmath1o ratio in their atmosphere as a result of mass transfer from an evolved companion @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of c@xmath1o observed in these stars is 1.5 @xcite .",
    "the parameter ranges chosen to represent these objects are given in table  4 .",
    "we have optimised the parameters for dust production by only considering the highest values possible for the c@xmath1o ratio and the gas density .",
    "r coronae borealis stars ( rcb s ) are yellow supergiants which are hydrogen deficient and carbon rich .",
    "these stars show irregular declines in visual brightness caused by the production of thick dust clouds @xcite .",
    "there are also variations in observed colour that correspond to the minimum in visual brightness and which are attributed to pulsations @xcite .",
    "these stars have fast stellar winds that feed into a thin dust shell found hundreds of stellar radii away @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of the ejected dust differs from the ism , with a uv absorption peak at 2500  @xcite .",
    "models indicate that this corresponds to small glassy or amorphous carbon grains ( soot ) formed in a hydrogen - poor environment @xcite .",
    "the dust formation mechanism is not at all well understood and there has been much debate as to where the dust condensation occurs .",
    "there are two main models : i ) the first assumes the grains are formed at @xmath2520 r@xmath26 , and ii ) the second proposes that dust is formed in the photosphere of the star and moves quickly away due to radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind the first method is that the stellar surface temperature greatly exceeds the grain condensation temperature for carbon @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the pulsations stronger than a certain critical amplitude could cause atmospheric shocks to form in a process similar to that proposed for agb outflows .",
    "this yields post - shock gas temperatures and densities of t@xmath251000 - 1500  k and n@xmath27 @xmath13 , which may be propitious for dust formation .",
    "in fact , observations by @xcite indicate that there are two populations of grains which may indicate that both formation processes are occurring .",
    "we investigate c@xmath0h@xmath0 formation on the assumption of the first model , i.e. molecule / dust formation at a radius of 20 r@xmath28 from the star .",
    "the temperature of the gas in this region is observed to be @xmath29 1500 k @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature of rcb s range from 4,000 - 20,000 k , with mean values of 6000 - 8000 k for dust - forming sources @xcite .",
    "the parameter ranges adopted for this scenario are given in table  4 .",
    "the abundances for carbon , nitrogen and helium were obtained from @xcite , whereas all other abundances are assumed to be solar .",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath0 formation is a necessary , but not sufficient , criterion for carbon dust formation via pah chemistry .",
    "therefore we need to establish the criterion for a positive result , i.e. the minimum fractional abundance of c@xmath0h@xmath0 that will explain the requisite abundance of dust nucleation sites . to do this ,",
    "we follow @xcite ; where the number of grains is equated to the number of nucleation sites . considering the case of a nova ,",
    "the number of grains , n@xmath30 , inferred from infrared observations is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the dust shell condenses at a radius @xmath32 cm , and has a typical thickness of @xmath33/10 .",
    "the shell volume is therefore @xmath34 , implying a number density of grains of @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "note that this is a lower limit , subject to the ejecta configuration .",
    "the gas density is @xmath37 @xmath36 , hence the minimum fractional abundance of nucleation sites needed is @xmath38 . on the assumption that each c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecule is efficiently converted into a nucleation site ( i.e. that there are no kinetic bottlenecks in the formation of larger molecules )",
    ", we can very crudely adopt this value as the threshold for the minimum fractional abundance of acetylene which can promote a pah - driven dust formation pathway .",
    "results from our models are shown in figures  [ fig : agb]-[fig : rcorborstar ] as contour plots of the equilibrium abundance of c@xmath0h@xmath0 as a function of density and photspheric temperature .",
    "we discuss the results for the four cases in sections ",
    "[ sec : resagb ] -  [ sec : resrcor ] .",
    "the results for agb winds are presented in figure [ fig : agb ] .",
    "the figure shows that the c@xmath0h@xmath0 abundance is not strongly sensitive to the density .",
    "there is , however , a strong dependence on the photospheric temperature . for photospheric temperatures below @xmath252500k , c@xmath0h@xmath0 can be produced with the requisite efficiency for any density within the range explored ( @xmath39@xmath13 ) .",
    "the lack of senitivity to density implies that _ if _ c@xmath0h@xmath0 leads to pah formation , then the production of dust will not be crtically limited to the geemetrical dilution of the wind .",
    "the results for nova outflows are presented in figure  [ fig : nova ] and show the opposite trends what was found for agb winds ; a strong dependence on density , but only a weak dependence on photospheric temperature . despite the high abundance of carbon in novae @xcite ,",
    "the photospheric temperatures are ten times higher than for agb stars and , even after significant geometrical dilution is taken into account , c@xmath0h@xmath0 is highly susceptible to photodissociation and never attains appreciable abundances .",
    "this is a strongly negative result and supports the findings of previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - c@xmath0h@xmath0 can not be produced in irradiated nova environments at abundance levels sufficient to seed dust formation via pah chemistry .",
    "the only way that a positive result could be obtained is if the ejecta were extremely dense ( n@xmath40@xmath13 ) allowing three - body chemical reactions to take place , or strongly shielded from the nova radiation field .",
    "results for the circumstellar environment of carbon - rich stars with photospheric temperatures of 37506000k are presented in figure  [ fig : gkstar ] .",
    "the critical fractional abundance of @xmath41 is not reached . however , for the lowest photospheric temperatures ( t@xmath294500k ) and highest densities ( n@xmath42 @xmath13 ) the abundance is very much closer to the threshold than was the case for the nova outflows .",
    "we can conclude that , whilst the spherically symmetric model produces a negative result , a positive result may be obtained in the event of ejecta clumping and/or stratification .    however , unlike the situation with agb outflows , this result is not robust to density variations so , if the clumps were to dissipate within the temperature window for pah formation then the c@xmath0h@xmath0 abundance ( and dust formation efficiency ) would be strongly diminished .",
    "the results for the gas in a stellar wind located at a radius of 20 r@xmath26 from an r coronae borealis star are presented in figure [ fig : rcorborstar ] .",
    "a positive result is obtained for part of the range of the physical conditions that we have investigated .",
    "the dependencies are similar to those found for the outflows from g - k stars in that there is a strong dependence on density and a weaker dependence on photospheric temperature .",
    "the requisite fractional abundance of c@xmath0h@xmath0 is obtained for densities that @xmath43 @xmath13 . for photospheric temperatures",
    "t@xmath44 6000k , a positive reult can be obtained at lower densities .",
    "we again note that any density enhancements that may exist within the outflow will strongly strengthen this result .",
    "we have used a simple model of the steady - state chemistry of several different astrophysical dust forming environments to consider the stability of acetylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) . in previous studies of dust formation , based on terrestrial flame chemistries ,",
    "this molecule is a precursor to pah formation and so its presence at appreciable abundance levels can be used to estabish the viability of pah formation and , by inference , dust formation based on pah condensation chemistry .",
    "however , c@xmath0h@xmath0 is highly suceptible to photodissoocation by stellar ultraviolet .",
    "the novel approach in this study is that we have carefully calculated the photodissociation rates for the molecular species involved in the c@xmath0h@xmath0 chemistry , subject to the local radiation field .",
    "previous studies had made major simplifying assumptions in this respect .    in each case",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the c@xmath0h@xmath0 abundance as a function of gas density and photospheric temperature . in general , we find that the inclusion of accurate photorates significantly restricts the parameter space within which efficient c@xmath0h@xmath0 formation ( and hence , presumably , pah formation ) can occur .    in the case of the winds driven by thermally pulsing agb stars , we find that - as in previous studies - c@xmath0h@xmath0 can be formed very efficiently indeed and that a pah chemistry is therefore at least a viable pathway for carbon dust formation in these environments .",
    "this is an interesting results as some previous studies ( which have not included photochemistry in their modelling ) have not been so successful at producing c@xmath0h@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we find that this positive result only holds for photospheric temperatures that are @xmath292500k .",
    "there are dust - producing carbon agb stars with photospheric temperatures @xmath45k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if we were to include a more accurate physical model of the outflows , including shocks and clumping , a pah chemistry may also be applicable in these objects .",
    "alternatively , other dust formation mechanisms may be operating .",
    "as compared to the dust - forming environment of agb stars , the ejectae of novae are subject to a much stronger radiation field with a significantly higher black - body temperature .",
    "the photodissociation rates for unshielded molecular species , such as c@xmath0h@xmath0 , are very much larger than in the other sources considered in this study ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a result c@xmath0h@xmath0 can never attain significant abundances .",
    "of course , other factors should be taken into account - such as possible variations in the elemental abundances in the ejecta - but the extreme clumping required is incompatible with the observed spherical coverage of the optically thick dust shell in these objects . in this case",
    ", it seems that other ( non pah - based ) formation channels must be operating - involving species that can survive the intense radation field ( e.g. c@xmath0 , which is partly shielded by the carbon ionization continuum @xcite ) .",
    "ch subgiants have physical characteristics that are closer to main sequence stars than stars in the giant phase .",
    "they have lower luminosities than equivalent stars on the main sequence and are known to be chemically peculiar @xcite , having a carbon over - abundance .",
    "the winds from these stars are not expected to have the same shock - generated density enhancements as in the agb outflows .",
    "thus , even with the extreme parameters we have chosen , we only obtain a marginally positive result - with moderate c@xmath0h@xmath0 abundances obtained at the lowest photospheric temperatures and highest gas densities ( t@xmath294500k , n@xmath42 @xmath13 ) . again ,",
    "an environment that is conducive to c@xmath0h@xmath0-pah chemistry may exist if significant clumping occurs , but it would seem that alternative dust formation pathways are more likely in these environments .    finally , we find that c@xmath0h@xmath0 abundances that are sufficient to drive a pah chemistry can be obtained in the winds of r coronae borealis stars , provided the density is high enough ( @xmath43 @xmath13 ) .",
    "this suggests that the large grains detected in the dust shells of these objects @xcite could be produced via a c@xmath0h@xmath0-pah chemistry operating in dense ejected clouds .",
    "by contrast , it is possible that the smaller grains observed in these sources may form via an alternative mechanism .    in summary",
    ", we find that c@xmath0h@xmath0 ( and pah ) formation is at least viable in agb outflows and the denser parts of r cor bor winds , but is only possible in the winds of ch subginats if significant clumping is present , and is not possible at all in nova winds .",
    "therefore , on the basis of these studies , it is evident that the formation pathway for ( carbon ) dust can not be the same in all environments ; in particular , the modified flame - pah chemsitries that provide a plausible formation channel in the dust - rich winds of thermally pulsing agb stars can not be applied to environments such as novae and may only have a marginal importance in rcor bor winds . it would therefore seem that multiple ( and , as yet , largely undefined ) pathways for the kinetic formation of carbon dust exist .",
