    "so what we really are after is a way to _ define _ the expression in the third line  and use _ that _ definition to define the expression in the first line .",
    "let us discuss a bit more , why exactly the transformations in eq .",
    "( [ partition_function_phi ] ) are interesting .",
    "they are interesting because they express the fact that , while the function , @xmath1 , may have a quite complicated distribution  the object of our study!there exists a functional of @xmath1 , @xmath27 that is a gaussian field , with ultra  local two  point function ",
    "it s a _ non  propagating _ field  in contrast to @xmath1 , whose propagator , @xmath28 , is , _ a priori _ , not ultra  local .",
    "this is very surprising .",
    "there are two cases , where such fields are known to appear : ( a ) when a gauge symmetry is present and these fields express the redundancy of the degrees of freedom and/or ( b ) when supersymmetry is present and these fields are the auxiliary fields that ensure it is realized off",
    " shell  @xcite .",
    "so a natural question is , whether it s possible to understand which case is realized in the class of theories described by the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ partition_function_phi ] ) . of course it may happen that none is realized",
    ", if the partition function can not be defined , absent a cutoff .",
    "( in fact , as we shall find , both cases are realized : a gauge symmetry is , indeed , present and auxiliary fields do appear . )    we shall try to elucidate these issues in this paper , in a context that allows us to perform calculations in a controlled way . for , indeed , the reason eq .",
    "( [ partition_function_phi ] ) is , also , useful , is that it provides the framework to perform calculations that are not limited to perturbation theory .",
    "we use a lattice regularization and compute the correlation functions by monte carlo simulations . a check on our numerical calculations",
    "is thus provided by the identities that stem from the gaussian distribution of @xmath21 .",
    "the classical equations of motion imply that the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ auxf ] ) is drawn from the same gaussian distribution as @xmath21 so , if we can compute the correlation functions of the scalar , we can check , whether quantum corrections respect this  or not .",
    "such calculations seem to involve `` dynamical fermions''since the `` classical action '' contains a term such as @xmath29 and , thus , seem very challenging ( albeit much less than in four space - time dimensions ) . a nice feature of quantum mechanics , however , is that the `` fermion '' kinetic term is a total derivative  individual `` fermions '' do not propagate in the bulk , only `` fermion '' bilinears , whose propagator is completely determined by the correlation functions of the scalar , propagate : the fermions are `` confined '' in dipoles , can be exactly integrated out and leave behind a `` polyakov loop '' of a functional of the scalar  that makes an ultra  local contribution to the action .    for ease of exposition we shall use the terms `` bosonic '' ( or `` scalar '' ) resp",
    ". `` fermionic '' to denote `` commuting '' resp . `` anticommuting '' worldline fields .",
    "they are , of course , both , `` target space '' scalars .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ susy_class ] we study , whether the classical action in eq .",
    "( [ partition_function_phi ] ) is invariant under a transformation , whose parameters are anticommuting variables and whose anticommutator closes on translations in euclidian time .",
    "the difficulty in realizing this symmetry , already at the classical level , as we shall see , stems from the _ local _ terms , those that contain derivatives .",
    "we show that the `` fermionic '' kinetic term is , always , a total derivative , therefore the `` fermions '' appear as ultra ",
    "local bilinears on the boundary and in the bulk .",
    "we recall that an action , that contains _ two _ `` fermions''and one `` boson''_is _ invariant under such transformations and that one of the `` fermions '' is a gauge artifact , since only one of them enters in the action with a time derivative , they transform differently under the supersymmetry transformations and we may choose which one transforms which way .",
    "this gauge symmetry is known as @xmath0symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the constraints , that project out the `` spurious '' fermion , are `` pure spinor '' type constraints . introducing a ( non covariant ) gauge - fixing term ,",
    "we show that the gauge - fixed partition function coincides with that of the stochastic approach .",
    "we shall use this ( gauge - fixed ) partition function to compute the relations between the correlation functions of the auxiliary field that stem from wick s theorem and , thereby , check supersymmetry beyond the classical action .",
    "we , also , discuss why the `` second '' fermion is necessary , within the context of a consistent quantum mechanics and that the `` observable '' superpartner of the `` scalar '' , @xmath1 , is another scalar , the fermion bilinear , @xmath30 , whose correlation functions may be computed from the correlation functions of @xmath31 .",
    "in section  [ susy_qu ] we set up the framework to compute the relations between the correlation functions using a lattice regularization .",
    "we first treat the case where @xmath32 never vanishes .",
    "we explicitly show that the change of variables from the scalar to the auxiliary field , within the lattice discretization , does lead to a gaussian distribution for the auxiliary field , with an ultra ",
    "local 2point function , up to terms that vanish as powers of the lattice spacing , or are surface terms .    in subsection  [ fzm ]",
    "we show how the calculation may be set up , when @xmath32 can vanish , i.e. fermionic zeromodes are present .",
    "this case is quite involved , so we do not present , yet , numerical results for it here , only several consistency checks of the expressions involved to show they are well - defined .",
    "specifically we show that the appropriate field seems to be not @xmath1 , but @xmath33 , the fourier transform of its time derivative , @xmath34 , through a hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transform , that linearizes the kinetic term of the scalar .",
    "the numerical results , for the case @xmath35 , are presented in section  [ numerics ] .",
    "we show that the 1point function of the auxiliary field does vanish , within the precision of the monte carlo simulation , the 2point function vanishes , within precision , for non  zero values of its argument and that the connected part of the 4point function vanishes , as well .",
    "these results are all compatible with the auxiliary field being drawn from a gaussian distribution , centered at zero and with ultra ",
    "local propagator , thereby confirming supersymmetry of the partition function .",
    "we can not , yet , complete the proof by showing that all correlation functions of the auxiliary field satisfy wick s theorem , however .",
    "completing the induction step remains , thus , an open problem .",
    "while for the 1point function the proof is complete , the proof for the 2point function requires that we show that the irrelevant terms we have discarded , when writing the action as a perfect square , do remain irrelevant .",
    "this would , in fact , suffice to complete the proof for all correlation functions .",
    "we end with our conclusions and ideas about directions of further inquiry .",
    "one natural direction is towards more than one euclidian dimensions : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , describing a @xmath38dimensional target space(time ) , in the classical case  and the corresponding superspace in the quantum case .",
    "the @xmath39 may then be identified with the components of the spin vector  @xcite , contributing a pauli term , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the electromagnetic field strength , whereas the classical coordinates @xmath42 couple , directly , to the gauge potential through the term @xmath43 .",
    "the generalization to field and string theory  @xcite is , of course , one goal .",
    "one way to attain it might be through the worldline formalism to field theory  @xcite .",
    "another is how to describe entanglement .",
    "this topic has , so far , been treated , in the canonical formalism , in terms of density matrices .",
    "the path integral approach , presented here , should be able to provide a space - time description of entanglement .",
    "to achieve this we must describe two  particle configurations in the stochastic formalism .",
    "intuitively we expect that two , classically non - interacting , particles will exhibit entanglement if they interact with the same noise configuration . how this may be achieved in practice",
    "will be described in future work .",
    "some technical details are presented in the appendices , namely , how the `` fermion '' contribution encodes the more familiar loop expansion and how the correlation functions of the `` superpartner '' to the scalar are expressed in terms of the correlation functions of the scalar itself in a way that is reminiscent of disorder variables in spin models  @xcite .",
    "we , also , prove that , for the cubic superpotential , the partition function , defined by the dual variables , is , indeed , real and positive , by showing that the probability density the moments , implicitly , define is symmetric about the average value .",
    "let us look at @xmath44 $ ] more closely .",
    "it would seem that @xmath45= \\int\\,d\\tau\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\\phi(\\tau)}\\right)^2- \\psi_\\alpha(\\tau)\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial\\phi(\\tau)^2}\\psi_\\beta(\\tau ) \\right]\\ ] ] is invariant under the non - linear transformation  @xcite @xmath46 with @xmath47 , a pair of anti commuting variables .",
    "this transformation can , in fact , be linearized by introducing an auxiliary field , @xmath48 , and writing the action as follows : @xmath49= \\int\\,d\\tau\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}f(\\tau)^2+f(\\tau)\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\\phi(\\tau ) } -\\frac{1}{2}\\psi_\\alpha(\\tau)\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial\\phi(\\tau)^2}\\psi_\\beta(\\tau ) \\right]\\ ] ] the transformation  ( [ susy_nl ] ) becomes @xmath50 if this transformation leaves the action invariant : @xmath51=\\\\ \\displaystyle \\hskip1truecm \\int\\,d\\tau\\,\\left [ fu''\\zeta_\\alpha\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi_\\beta-\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta_\\alpha f\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}u''\\psi_\\beta - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi_\\alpha\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\zeta_\\beta u '' f\\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] the expression in brackets in the second line should either vanish or become a total derivative .",
    "this expression does vanish , if @xmath52=0=[u'',f]$ ] , i.e. if @xmath53 is an ultra  local functional .",
    "it fails to vanish , if @xmath53 is not ultra  local , but contains derivatives , since , in that case , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , we remark that the ultra  local terms in @xmath53 will cancel out in @xmath56 , but the local terms will not leave a total derivative . so there are terms missing in the transformation .",
    "an easy calculation leads to the expression : @xmath57\\ ] ] now @xmath58 since @xmath59 .",
    "therefore @xmath60\\ ] ] were the relative sign a plus , instead of the minus , then we would have obtained a total derivative .",
    "in fact transformations  ( [ susy_lin ] ) are not the most general , linear in the fields , we can write , consistent with all symmetries ( namely the @xmath61 transformations of the fermions ) .",
    "we can add the following terms to the variations of the fermion and the auxiliary field @xmath62 if we include these terms , we shall find that @xmath63 , but that the choice of @xmath64 does nt have any effect at all in making the variation of the lagrangan a total derivative .",
    "we realize that the action is _ not _ invariant under these transformations .",
    "therefore we conclude that the stochastic identities satisfied by @xmath21 , as a functional of @xmath1 , seem logically distinct from invariance under transformations with anticommuting parameters , in the presence of derivatives .",
    "indeed , the paradox becomes even more acute , if we consider the case @xmath65 . in that case , that of a massless , free , scalar , if we impose an infrared cutoff , by putting the system in a box , we do , apparently , find that @xmath66 , since the contribution of the `` bosonic '' determinant , @xmath67 , seems to be exactly cancelled by the contribution of the  fermionic determinant , @xmath68 , while the action is , apparently , not invariant under the transformations  ( [ susy_lin ] )  ( [ susy_lin_1 ] ) .    in fact ,",
    "let us write the variation of the action , under _ arbitrary _ variations , @xmath69 , that vanish at the boundaries ( or infinity ) .",
    "we find the following expression : @xmath70 \\end{array}\\ ] ] the last term tells us that the fermions do nt propagate in the `` bulk''and the next to last term that , unless the matrix @xmath71 has zero modes , the fermions vanish in the bulk , in the classical limit . indeed , the kinetic term of the fermion is a total derivative : @xmath72 and , therefore , contributes a surface term , whatever the variations are .",
    "so there are further features of the relation between the stochastic identities and `` supersymmetric '' transformations that remain to be clarified .",
    "it _ is _ , indeed , possible to write an action , @xmath73\\ ] ] that contains derivatives and that is invariant  up to total derivatives  under transformations with anticommuting parameters  @xcite , for instance :",
    "@xmath74 under this transformation we remark that the fermion @xmath75 , that does enter in the action through its derivative , is inert , whereas the fermion , @xmath76 , that does transform non - trivially , seems to play the role of a lagrange multiplier .",
    "it is possible to find another transformation , with anticommuting parameters , under which the role of the two fermions is exchanged  @xcite : @xmath77 as @xcite note , it is the anticommutator of these two transformations that closes on the generator of the ( euclidian ) time translations , @xmath78 thereby providing the justification for bestowing the name `` supersymmetric '' to these transformations .",
    "it is noteworthy that _ which _ of the two fermions we call @xmath79 and which @xmath80 is a choice we are free to make independently , at each time instant .",
    "this can be seen to follow from the fact that we can exchange @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the potential term exactly and , up to a total derivative , in the kinetic term , as well .",
    "we must make such a choice , since the two do nt enter the transformations in the same way  but any one choice is as good as any other : this is an example of a gauge symmetry , called `` @xmath0symmetry ''  @xcite in this context .",
    "the action , obtained through the stochastic approach , is , thus , already , `` gauge  fixed '' , with respect to the @xmath0symmetry .",
    "let s try to understand how this is realized .",
    "it becomes easier to apprehend what is happening , if we consider the @xmath81 and @xmath82 as two different `` flavors '' , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , in the fundamental representation of flavor @xmath85 . then we notice that the kinetic term @xmath86 +                                                                             \\int\\,d\\tau\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\psi_\\alpha\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\chi_\\beta\\right)=\\\\ \\displaystyle \\hskip2truecm \\int\\,d\\tau\\,\\frac{\\partial\\psi_{\\alpha , i}}{\\partial\\tau}\\left[\\frac{-\\mathrm{i}\\sigma_2}{2}\\right]^{ij}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi_{\\beta , j } +     \\int\\,d\\tau\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\psi_{\\alpha , i}\\left[\\sigma_1\\right]^{ij}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi_{\\beta , j}\\right ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] similarly , the potential term can be written as follows : @xmath87 w''(\\phi ) =   \\int\\,d\\tau\\ , w''(\\phi)\\psi_{\\alpha , i}\\left[\\frac{\\sigma_1}{2}\\right]^{ij}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi_{\\beta , j}\\ ] ] we can diagonalize the kinetic term by a global , unitary , transformation in `` flavor '' space , @xmath88 which , therefore , preserves the measure of the path integral .",
    "the eigenvalues , @xmath89.then we see that the kinetic term @xmath90^{ij}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi_{\\beta , j } = \\frac{\\partial\\psi_{\\alpha , i}}{\\partial\\tau}\\frac{\\varepsilon^{ij}}{2}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi_{\\beta , j } =   \\frac{\\partial x_{\\alpha , i}}{\\partial\\tau}\\frac{\\lambda_i}{2}\\delta^{ij}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta } x_{\\beta , j } = \\\\ \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{4 } \\left(\\lambda^i   \\frac{\\partial x_{\\alpha , i}}{\\partial\\tau } \\delta^{ij } \\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}x_{\\beta , j } + \\lambda^j x_{\\alpha , i } \\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta } \\delta^{ij } \\frac{\\partial x_{\\beta , j}}{\\partial\\tau } \\right ) =   % \\displaystyle % \\hskip3.5truecm \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{4}x_{\\alpha , i}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left[\\sigma_3\\right]^{ij}x_{\\beta , j}\\right ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] becomes , indeed , a total derivative .",
    "the potential term takes the following form under this transformation : @xmath91 eq .",
    "( [ totalderivative ] ) implies that the fermions do not propagate in the bulk , or the boundaries .",
    "it implies that only as ultra ",
    "local fermion bilinears do they contribute to the action .",
    "we can decompose the fermion bilinears in combinations of given isospin , namely an isotriplet and an isosinglet .",
    "we notice that the kinetic term and the potential term contain the @xmath92 combinations ; the isosinglet , @xmath93 , and the @xmath94 component of the triplet , i.e. two of the four fermionic fields , are `` projected out '' and only two are `` physical '' .",
    "the particle , as it propagates , creates a medium , where the `` fermions '' are `` confined '' in pairs , `` dipoles '' .",
    "these `` dipoles '' do nt `` see '' the scalar itself , @xmath1 , however , but the  generically  composite field , @xmath32",
    ". therefore it will be the `` dipoles '' that will have interesting correlations , that can be probed through the correlations of @xmath32 .",
    "however it is not possible to `` break '' the dipoles , to `` deconfine '' the fermions .",
    "to achieve this requires propagating `` fermions '' , i.e. a non - trivial @xmath95matrix algebra , that does not exist here , where the poincar group consists only of time translations .",
    "what this , also , means is that , while the `` microscopic '' fields are a ( worldline ) `` scalar '' and a ( worldline ) `` fermion '' , components of a chiral supermultiplet , in fact the `` observable '' degrees of freedom are two scalars , @xmath1 and @xmath96 , a bound state of the `` fermion '' , that couples to the polyakov loop of @xmath32 ( for periodic bounder conditions ; to the wilson line for dirichlet boundary conditions ) , i.e. to non  local quantities . of course",
    ", what this statement means is that , when @xmath1 has local correlation functions , @xmath97 has non - local ones and vice versa .",
    "this is a typical duality relation , with the @xmath97 playing the role of a `` disorder variable '' , in the context of spin models .",
    "the correlation functions of @xmath97 can , indeed , be computed , from the stochastic action , as follows : @xmath98 the minus sign in the exponent is crucial : it identifies the exponentials as `` defects '' .    in other words , an insertion of the fermionic bilinear corresponds to an insertion of @xmath31 at that point .",
    "we prove this relation in appendix  [ sfield ] .",
    "this is , of course , true if @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath32 can vanish these expressions are nt well - defined .",
    "what should replace them in that case is not , yet , clear .",
    "we note that , for the quadratic superpotential , these correlation functions are all constants , which illustrates that the @xmath97 is not described by a local field theory  when the @xmath1 is .",
    "even though supersymmetry may be realized  the classical action is invariant and @xmath0symmetry is fixed  thus the `` scalar '' and the `` fermion '' are degenerate in mass , the `` observable '' partners @xmath1 and @xmath97 are _ not _ degenerate in mass  the mass of @xmath99 is , at least , twice the mass of the `` fermion '' .",
    "the partner exists only as a bound state of the fundamental `` fermion '' , in a way similar to the schwinger model .",
    "this means that , in the model under investigation , supersymmetry is realized , nevertheless the spectrum can be non  degenerate , with the `` fermion '' hidden in a composite particle .",
    "the advantage of the present formalism is , first of all , that it does allow concrete calculations and , equally important , allows us to imagine experiments : ion trap technology , quantum wires and quantum dots  @xcite allow us to study ( quantum ) features of particles in ways that were not available thirty years ago .    to be able to provide specific predictions",
    ", we need to study what happens beyond the classical action , i.e. take into account field configurations that are not solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "we need to study the partition function @xmath100\\,e^{-s[\\phi , f , x]}\\ ] ] in this expression we integrate over all possible configurations of the fermions , @xmath101 . in order for this expression not to vanish , we must check that , when we expand the exponential , we have enough fermionic factors from the expansion to saturate the measure .",
    "however we must , also , ensure that we re not overcounting , that we have `` fixed '' non - compact gauge symmetries .",
    "let us show how the calculation goes .",
    "the integral over the fermions factorizes over the euclidian time , so let us present the computation for one time instant .",
    "the integral over the @xmath101 , at a fixed time , @xmath20 , is given by @xmath102 since the @xmath101 anticommute , their ultra  local bilinears commute : @xmath103=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath104 when we insert this expression in eq .",
    "( [ zfermionic ] ) , we remark that the terms @xmath105 and @xmath106 give vanishing contribution to the partition function , since the anticommuting variables of the measure are not fully paired with the anticommuting variables of the integrand .",
    "the terms @xmath107 vanish since the @xmath101 are nilpotent .",
    "the only term , therefore , that provides a non - vanishing contribution , is the term @xmath108 . and here we see that we have a problem , since this contribution is proportional to @xmath109 .",
    "this is the contribution of _ two _ fermion flavors , not one .",
    "indeed , we havent projected out two anticommuting variables , among the four , i.e. one fermion .",
    "since the measure contains four anticommuting variables  whereas the action is quadratic in these variables  the latter s expansion will contain contributions from both fermions .",
    "fermion doubling is , thus , present , since we havent fixed the @xmath0symmetry .",
    "we must include a term in the partition function , that will stop the expansion to quadratic order .",
    "we need , in the fermionic measure , a `` gauge  fixing '' term of the form @xmath110^{ij}n^b\\delta^{ab}x_{\\beta , j}$ ] , that projects out the @xmath111 states .",
    "we note that this projection is the avatar of the `` gso projection ''  @xcite in higher dimensions and recognize in the conditions @xmath112 the one  dimensional avatar of the `` pure spinor constraints ''  @xcite .",
    "these hold at the level of the classical action , as we saw above .",
    "at the quantum level they imply that the `` physical '' correlation functions contain an insertion of this combination , i.e. are given by the expressions @xmath113_\\mathrm{physical } =    \\frac{\\left\\langle x_{\\alpha , i}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\sigma^{a}n^b\\delta^{ab}x_{\\beta , j}{\\mathcal o}\\right\\rangle }   { \\left\\langle x_{\\alpha , i}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\sigma^{a}n^b\\delta^{ab}x_{\\beta , j}\\right\\rangle}\\ ] ] where the expectation values of the rhs are evaluated from the partition function  ( [ zx ] ) .",
    "this should imply that the @xmath114 that enter these expressions are the identity and @xmath115 . as we shall see below this expression",
    "is well defined because neither denominator nor numerator vanish identically .",
    "this equation is a _ definition _ of the lhs and raises the question of the partition function that can compute it .",
    "of course the constraint  ( [ pure_spinor ] ) is not `` covariant '' , in the following sense : since it projects out one `` fermion '' , it , actually , picks out a direction of time .",

    "therefore , we conclude that the partition function , up to irrelevant terms , is , indeed , given by a product of gaussian integrals over the auxiliary field and , assuming the irrelevant terms remain irrelevant , the lattice action , in terms of the auxiliary field , does respect the stochastic identities .",
    "let us , finally , note the following fact : for a finite system , the lattice action is defined up to an additive constant .",
    "such a contribution will not affect the value of any correlation function , since it cancels in the ratio .",
    "furthermore , we remark that the value of the parameter @xmath173 , that enters eq .",
    "( [ polyakov_loop ] ) , can be rescaled by an arbitrary , finite , constant .",
    "such a rescaling will only give rise , precisely , to an additive contribution to the action and , thus , will be completely invisible to any correlation function .",
    "therefore the vacuum energy remains undefined , even though the partition function can be written as a gaussian integral .",
    "the correct statement is that this constant is independent of the field configuration : `` fermions '' and `` bosons '' make equal contributions to its value .",
    "conversely , if @xmath173 , in the term , @xmath203 , does not have the same value as the @xmath173 , that multiplies @xmath204 , by adding an appropriate constant to the action , that can not contribute to any correlation function , we can make it take the same value . once more , this is due to the fact that the anticommuting variables do not propagate individually , but contribute an ultra  local term , of fixed sign .    in section  [ numerics ]",
    "we discuss how to relate the correlation functions of the auxiliary field to those of the scalar in practice  and test the assumption that the , neglected , irrelevant terms , do not contribute to linearly divergent correlation functions .",
    "before we do that , let us discuss how to set up the calculation , when fermionic zeromodes are present .",

    "so we can not draw the conclusion of the preceding paragraphs , without , first , having regularized this ambiguity .",

    "( [ nsiteszp ] ) @xmath213 label the _ position _ in the dual system  whereas their `` dual variables '' , @xmath214 , , label the _ velocity _ in the original system .",
    "therefore @xmath239 is the _ velocity _ of the dual system  and the force ( per unit mass ) in the original system .",
    "the physical meaning of the condition that @xmath240 , which implies that @xmath66 , is that the ( average ) velocity , @xmath241 , is constant , so the dual system describes a free particle . for the original system",
    "it means that the force is constant .",
    "this is the expression , in this context , of the well - known criteria for supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "we deduce that , if these conditions do not hold , then supersymmetry will be broken  and they express what this breaking means : that the dual variables do not describe a free particle .    for , in order to reconstruct the probability density of the @xmath222 it is necessary to compute , not only the correlation functions of the ultra ",
    "local quantities , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , but to take , also , into account the insertion and the correlation functions of the kinetic terms , expressed , here in terms of the @xmath213 , dual variables .",
    "what remains to be understood is how the duality transformation , between the @xmath213 variables and the @xmath222 variables is , explicitly , realized at the level of correlation functions . from eq .",
    "( [ nsiteszp ] ) we obtain the correlation functions , @xmath244 , of the @xmath213 variables . from the definition  ( [ hubbstraton ] )",
    "we realize that the @xmath213 are the fourier transforms of @xmath245 .",
    "how these insights can translate readily to computationally efficient code remains to be seen . a possible strategy , however , can be the following : to generate configurations @xmath222 , using the scalar action and , from them , to compute the identities that should be satisfied by @xmath246 . for , as we recall in appendix  [ ptheory ] , the loop expansion of the scalar action is encoded in the expansion of the polyakov loop .",
    "so by computing the correlation functions of the auxiliary field by monte carlo simulations , we are taking into account configurations that are , in fact , sensitive to the effects encoded by the loop expansion and , eventually , beyond it , since the correlation functions , sampled from the lattice action , close to the scaling limit , are expected to encode the properties of the true measure in the space of field configurations .",
    "to test , whether this measure is , indeed , supersymmetric , it suffices to compute the identities that express wick s theorem for the auxiliary field .    in the next section",
    "we , therefore , return to the case of the quartic superpotential with a single minimum and test the formalism that was developed in section  [ lattice ] . in this way",
    "we shall understand much better , why it s not easy to detect worldline supersymmetry in quantum mechanics .",
    "we use a standard metropolis algorithm to generate configurations and compute the correlation functions .",

    "for the `` polyakov loop term '' , @xmath251 = \\log c m_\\mathrm{latt } + \\log\\left[\\frac{m_\\mathrm{latt}}{c}\\left(1+\\frac{\\phi_n^2}{2}\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] we remark that we can eliminate its  explicit ",

    ", @xmath262 is expected to vanish by translation invariance and due to the fact that it is an odd function of the field , whereas the action is an even function and the only minimum is at @xmath263 .",
    "so we can use the value of these 1point functions as a check of the precision of the numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , for the figures displayed in the following , where @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 , we find that @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "the non - trivial information is in the 2and 4point functions of the auxiliary field .    we compute @xmath269 , thanks to translation invariance .",
    "this , also , implies that we must take @xmath270 . to reduce numerical error of the estimator , it is a good idea to compute , in practice , the `` smeared '' correlator @xmath271 where @xmath272 are the samples .",
    "the ultra  local part of the connected 4point function , @xmath273 ( the so - called _ binder cumulant _ ) should , also , vanish , as a consequence of wick s theorem , if the auxiliary field is , indeed , drawn from a gaussian distribution , with @xmath274 .",
    "of course the full , connected 4point function should vanish ",
    "it s just much easier to check the ultra  local part , which is a necessary condition , anyway .",
    "computationally , it s better to evaluate the expression @xmath275 if we simply want to test whether it s non - zero or not .",
    "the reason is that @xmath276 and @xmath277 are quite comparable in magnitude , so their difference is subject to large numerical uncertainties . since @xmath277 is a strictly positive quantity , the vanishing  or not  of @xmath278",
    "is equivalent to that of @xmath279 .",
    "it is , thus , @xmath279 that we will try to estimate .",
    "we can then compute @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "in section  [ lattice ] we showed that these results for the auxiliary field test that the terms of the effective action , when written as a functional of the auxiliary field , that are proportional to positive powers of the lattice spacing , are , truly , irrelevant .",
    "therefore we do expect that @xmath282 vanish .",
    "it is then useful to check that the field , @xmath186 , in the scaling limit , does propagate and does nt have gaussian correlation functions : so we should calculate @xmath283 and @xmath284 or , rather , @xmath285 and check that the former is nt ultra  local and the latter two are non - zero , at the same level of numerical accuracy as we checked the correlators for the auxiliary field .",
    "this is very challenging .",
    "the time series for the scalar shows long autocorrelation times .",
    "we do find that @xmath286 is , typically , 10 times greater than @xmath282 . since @xmath287 , also , is about 10 times greater than @xmath288 , we estimate @xmath289 , at least , a factor of @xmath290 greater than @xmath291 . but things can be more favorable : for example , for @xmath264 , @xmath292 , @xmath266 , we find @xmath293 , whereas @xmath294 and @xmath295 , whereas @xmath296 .",
    "we hope to improve on these results using hybrid monte carlo methods .    in fig .",
    "[ numres128w ] we display typical monte carlo time series for the @xmath297point function of the auxiliary field and the scalar respectively , that provide support for the thesis that the former is ultra  local and the latter is not , for @xmath264 and @xmath266 .",
    "these results , along with the indications from the binder cumulants , illustrate that , while supersymmetry is realized in this system , it can be hard to spot .",
    "a detailed finite size scaling analysis is a priority .    in fig .",
    "[ numres128s ] we show results for the 2point functions at `` strong coupling '' , @xmath298 . in this case",
    "we find that @xmath299 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "the 1point functions are compatible with zero , @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "we generated @xmath305 samples , beyond @xmath306 initial configurations that were not taken into account , in order to reduce initialization effects and we kept every 5000th configuration , in an effort to reduce autocorrelation further .",
    "the time series for the 2point function of the scalar indicates that this , still , is nt enough .",
    "however the difference between the behavior of the auxiliary field and the scalar is visible , the binder cumulant for the former is significantly smaller than for the latter and being able to detect these differences is what counts here .",
    "as expected , the qualitative behavior does not change and supersymmetry is realized in the `` wigner mode '' at both `` weak '' and `` strong '' coupling .",
    "in this paper we have shown , using the stochastic formulation of quantum mechanics , that worldline supersymmetry is not a property that must be added to quantum mechanics , to obtain `` supersymmetric quantum mechanics '' , but is an intrinsic property thereof ",
    "far from being surprised at its presence , we should be surprised it hasnt been noticed till now .",
    "what had not been appreciated was the fact that , when the algebra of the @xmath95matrices is abelian , the kinetic term for grassmann variables is a total derivative  they ca nt propagate , only composite quantities thereof can have local correlation functions , that are completely determined by the correlation functions of the `` scalar '' fields ( the coordinate(s ) of the particle ) .",
    "how constraints can be taken into account  @xcite is , of course , an interesting challenge to take on , with the tools developed here .    on the mathematical level",
    "these facts were known  @xcite  however the relation to the work of refs .",

    "the question of whether the grassmann variables studied here can be identified with the `` hidden variables '' of einstein is thus answered in the affirmative , for the case that @xmath307>0 $ ] .",
    "the reason is that they can be identified with the degrees of freedom , that make a local contribution to the partition function , that allow us to take it equal to 1 .",
    "the fact that the partition function is finite means , simply , that the free energy can be reconstructed from the correlation functions .",
    "it does nt mean that the degrees of freedom that can lead to its taking a universal value ( independent of the parameters of the theory ) have local dynamics .",
    "the anticommuting variables studied here do have this latter property .",
    "for the case where @xmath307 $ ] can vanish , the calculations require more care and will be presented in future work .    what these results highlight is the relevance of the solutions to the first order equations , @xmath308 , the so - called bps states  @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions of the auxiliary field , as functionals of the scalar(s ) ( for chiral supermultiplets ) , and the relevance of the identities these satisfy , for describing supersymmetry breaking , encode , in particular , the non - renormalization theorems of supersymmetry  @xcite ; however , since their study involves non - perturbative aspects , how to use them effectively is non - trivial and is at the heart of the breakthroughs in supersymmetric gauge theories ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in the present work we have pushed the work of refs .",
    "@xcite to its logical conclusion , by harnessing the power of numerical techniques for testing the validity of the stochastic identities .",

    "the auxiliary field is gaussian , but with special features : ( a ) its 1point function vanishes , @xmath309 , its 2point function is ultra ",
    "local , @xmath310 ; the multi  point functions , @xmath311 are , of course , given by wick s theorem .    in the `` nambu",
    " goldstone mode ''",
    "the only thing that changes in these statements is that the 1point function of the auxiliary field is non - zero , @xmath312 .",
    "all other correlation functions satisfy the same relations , that express the fact that the auxiliary field has gaussian correlations . in this case",
    "the supersymmetry transformations imply that the `` fermion '' , @xmath76 , or @xmath75 can be identified with the goldstino , the massless particle that appears when a global symmetry is spontaneously broken  @xcite .",
    "its presence is , of course , a major issue in supersymmetry phenomenology .",
    "how it appears in this context , where only `` fermionic bilinears '' are defined , remains to be described .",
    "however , as was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a third option , in the zero  dimensional case : the identities for the correlation functions of the auxiliary field can have additional , anomalous , terms .",
    "the issue that remains to be clarified , therefore , is , whether this option can occur in one dimension .",
    "if it could , this would imply that the theory is nt unitary , since the auxiliary field would not have an ultra  local 2point function .",
    "this means that new degrees of freedom should appear . in section  [ fzm ]",
    "we showed what these may be : the `` dual field(s ) '' , @xmath213 , cf . also  @xcite .",
    "since these do not have dynamics that can be usefully studied in perturbation theory , in terms of the original scalar , numerical simulations are the natural tool .",
    "whether , in this way , it may be possible to break supersymmetry in a new way , in quantum mechanics and , then , in quantum field theory , while retaining the usefulness of the stochastic identities remains to be studied .",
    "what renders this approach effective is the control the grassmann variables offer over the quantum fluctuations .",
    "quantum mechanics _ is _ , in fact , a local theory but the variables that are needed to realize locality are grassmann variables .",
    "these appear as bilinears , that are not described by a local action , however , as can be seen from the properties of their correlation fuctions .",
    "this , of course , leads to the issue of their precise relation with entanglement , which remains to be elucidated .",
    "the boundary fermionic terms are expected to play a role here .",
    "we hope to provide a fuller account in future work .",
    "quantum mechanics has been , traditionally , studied in phase space , i.e. in the hamiltonian formalism  while quantum field theory has been studied in configuration space , i.e. in the lagrangian formalism .",
    "while the lagrangian formalism for quantum mechanics was introduced by dirac and feynman  @xcite as an explicitly space - time approach to quantum mechanics , in what way a quantum test particle probes spacetime differently than a classical test particle has not been spelled out  indeed what might replace the concept of a trajectory , when quantum effects are taken into account , was often declared to be meaningless .    in this paper",
    "we have shown , by explicit calculation that this is not true  by considering quantum mechanics as a quantum field theory , where the poincar group consists of the time translations only , we have found that how a quantum test particle can probe space - time can be described using the tools of quantum field theory and that it explores superspace in the same sense that a classical test particle explores space : the trajectory of a quantum test particle probes ( super)space , with the anticommuting coordinates describing the quantum fluctuations : the classical trajectory , @xmath1 , becomes a chiral superfield , @xmath313 , per direction of time , which is controlled by the anticommuting variables .",
    "we therefore realize that the superparticle  @xcite is , in fact , the quantum particle .",
    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics is quantum mechanics .",
    "a quantum test particle explores superspace in a very special way , as can be seen from the correlation functions of the fields .",
    "the `` anticommuting '' dimensions , @xmath25 are described through ultra  local scalar fields , @xmath314 , whose",
    "correlation functions are given by correlators of @xmath315 , when @xmath35 .",
    "a superspace formulation should be possible , which may lead to a covariant gauge ",
    "fixing for the @xmath0symmetry .",
    "it is , of course , legitimate to ask , whether this approach is another formulation of quantum mechanics and whether it might have consequences that might be amenable to a particular experimental test .",
    "the answer to both is yes .",
    "regarding the first question , however , the present formulation highlights that supersymmetry is not , simply , mathematically interesting and a tool for quantum field theory , but appears in ordinary quantum mechanics , in a way that had not been noticed to date .",
    "the stochastic approach allows us to identify the degrees of freedom that give rise to quantum fluctuations , to simplify considerably the calculations performed to date with them in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and leads to numerical algorithms that are straightforward to implement .",
    "it allows us to imagine new experiments for quantum matter on the one hand and , on the other hand , to use it as a testing ground in order to better understand the role supersymmetry might play in physics in general . for the moment we have studied one chiral multiplet . by introducing more , we are probing a richer target space , where spin can play a role  @xcite and , thus , that could accommodate target space supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we hope to report on progress on this in the near future .",
    "let us just remark that , in @xmath316 space dimensions , the langevin equation is given by @xmath317 for @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the classical action takes the following form @xmath318= \\int\\,d\\tau\\,\\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi^i}{d\\tau}+\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial\\phi^i}\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{2}\\psi_\\alpha^i(\\tau)\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(\\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\delta_{ij}+\\frac{\\partial^2w}{\\partial\\phi^i\\phi^j}\\right)\\psi_\\alpha^j(\\tau)\\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath319 .",

    "it is intriguing to attempt to integrate out the `` fermions '' in this case .",
    "we would then obtain as partition function @xmath331 = \\int[d\\phi]\\,\\left|\\mathrm{det}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial\\phi^i\\partial\\phi^j}+{\\sf g}f_{ij}\\right)\\right|\\,e^{-s[\\phi , a^i]}\\ ] ] with @xmath332 .",
    "the vanishing of the determinant would be expressed in a condition on the flux  reminiscent of flux compactifications  @xcite .",
    "we need to describe , in the stochastic formalism , the corresponding relativistic dynamics , which will lead to quantum field theory and target space spinors .",
    "we , also , realize that the action , that contains the vector potential terms , is not invariant under supersymmetry transformations : we have attempted to couple chiral superfields to a vector field .",
    "we should , of course , include the other components of the vector multiplet .",
