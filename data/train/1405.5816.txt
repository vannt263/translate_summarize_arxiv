    "a quotient of a topological space by an arbitrary equivalent relation has a natural topological space structure .",
    "the quotient of a hausdorff topological space by a hausdorff equivalence relation is a hausdorff topological space .",
    "manifolds are defined as hausdorff topological spaces endowed with a _ local _ smooth structure determined by an atlas . therefore , classically , in order to quotient manifolds we need an equivalence relation with some non - local structure : _ a fundamental domain_.    even when the quotient is a topological manifold , without a fundamental domain , it seems impossible from the classical point of view to recover a natural smooth structure inherited from the original one .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to overcome this difficulty in natural specific situations _ for a complex structure_. we show that some natural hausdorff quotients of the riemann sphere without fundamental domain led to a topological two dimensional sphere with a canonical complex structure . some of these quotients are dynamically motivated and natural , but not all of them . in these quotients of the riemann sphere , an open dense set of total measure can be collapsed into a set of zero measure .",
    "more precisely , the topological quotient is determined by an infinite number of holes in the riemann sphere .",
    "these holes have piecewise analytic boundaries and they can be dense in the sphere .",
    "the quotient is then obtained by pasting analytically the boundaries of the holes in this `` butchered riemann sphere '' .",
    "similar quotients exist in general riemann surfaces , but we restrict to consider the riemann sphere in this article that contains all the analytic complexity .",
    "one of the main heuristic ideas behind these techniques is the belief that complex structures can be though of as a more basic structure that the topological one .",
    "this seems paradoxical .",
    "a classical complex structure determines an underlying topological structure .",
    "the heuristics is that the classical definition is only a restricted definition of complex structures to topological manifolds .",
    "the general unrestricted definition has still to be found .",
    "many results in dynamics and geometry hint that such a general definition may exist .",
    "this philosophy is very useful in holomorphic dynamics , in particular in hedgehog theory ( hedgehogs are topologically complex invariant compacts associated to indifferent periodic orbits discovered by the author @xcite whose dynamics exhibits remarkable rigidity properties that are only to be expected when one thinks to the hedgehog as possesing an intrinsic complex structure ) .",
    "the general definition should be well behaved , i.e. immersions will induce complex structures .",
    "also should enjoy compactness properties as those of hausdorff - gromov length spaces .",
    "this circle of ideas can be traced back to riemann where the fundamental entity of complex structures permeates everywhere in the `` inaugural dissertation '' .",
    "this philosophy is a valuable guide in our problem of quotienting the butchered riemann sphere .",
    "we have a compact set in the sphere @xmath0 ( the complement of the open holes ) , that plays the role of `` fundamental domain '' ( but may have empty interior ... ) the complex structure on the riemann sphere should induce an intrinsic complex structure on @xmath0 that will induce a complex structure on the quotiented sphere . so one might expect to have a natural complex structure in the quotient",
    ". thus also a natural absolutely continuous class in the quotiented topological sphere .",
    "note that the absolutely continuous class will be determined by the conformal structure ( and not the other way around as classically ! )",
    ". there seems to be a priori no natural way to recover directly the absolutely continuous class without going through the complex structure .    because we do nt have a general definition of intrinsic complex structures",
    ", we will construct the complex structure in the quotient in an indirect way . in dimension",
    "@xmath1 complex structures can be identified with conformal structures .",
    "one of the main ideas consists in getting the wild topological quotient as a limit of quasi - conformal deformations which degenerate into the quotient .",
    "necessarily the quasi - conformal distorsion blows out since at the limit we get topological collapsing .",
    "these quasi - conformal deformations are defined by beltrami coefficients that can degenerate everywhere ( i.e. @xmath2 locally everywhere . )",
    "classical quasi - conformal theory is unable to provide the existence of a limit map of these rectification mappings for this wild type of collapsing .",
    "the second fundamental ingredient consists in combining classical quasi - conformal theory with classical potential theory .",
    "roughly speaking the quasi - conformal deformations will be compatible with the potential of a compact set in the riemann sphere ( the holes in the butchered riemann sphere are green lines for this potential ) .",
    "compactness coming from classical potential theory shows the existence of a unique topological collapsing that is the limit of the quasi - conformal deformations .",
    "the mixture of classical quasi - conformal theory and classical potential theory in order to obtain unique limits for degenerating quasi - conformal mappings is the new ingredient that provides the compactness that is lacking in the classical theory .",
    "d. sullivan already pointed out the analogy between beltrami coefficients parametrizing quasi - conformal mappings and @xmath3 densities parametrizing lipschitz mappings ( see @xcite p.468 ) pushing this analogy one might expect that degenerate beltrami coefficients will parametrize non - quasiconformal homeomorphisms in the same way that non - atomic measures parametrize general homeorphisms . the notion of virtual conformal structures ( see section [ conf_struct ] ) explains very accurately this analogy .",

    "no assumption of quasi - conformality with respect to the standard quasi - conformal structure is made .",
    "conformal structures can be transported by absolutely continuous almost everywhere differentiable homeomorphisms , or even continuous maps .",

    "the motivation for this article comes from problems in holomorphic dynamics and renormalization theory . here",
    "we present some of the analytic tools that are necessary to a new approach to the renormalization of polynomials .",
    "the main interest of this new renormalization is that it is canonical and , contrary to the classical douady - hubbard approach , natural in the class of polynomials since it remembers the polynomial structure of the dynamics by using the combinatorical structure of external rays ( and not only the polynomial - like structure ) . in particular",
