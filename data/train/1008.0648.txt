    "one of the most important products of nearby star research will be a volume - limited sample of nearby stars .",
    "all - inclusive volume - limited samples of stars will allow us to answer large numbers of questions about the formation , kinematics , stellar mass fraction , and metallicity distributions of stars and ( if representative ) the galaxy itself . due to the faintness of the m dwarfs that make up _ at least _",
    "72% of all nearby stars , surveys aiming at completeness are easiest carried out near the sun .",
    "large numbers of potential nearby stars have been found in ongoing series of proper motion surveys , most notably ( among others too numerous to mention here ) the surveys of luyten @xcite , giclas @xcite , pokorny , ourselves @xcite , and lepine @xcite .",
    "various other surveys have followed up on those discoveries with spectroscopy and photometry to determine distances and spectral properties of these systems , although a great many still remain uninvestigated . for our purposes , however , we need accurate distances to prove membership , obtain accurate luminosities , and good kinematics .    while there are many methods used to determine stellar distances ,",
    "the most accurate method remains the trigonometric parallax .",
    "it does not rely on any prior knowledge about the star ( as photometric and spectroscopic `` parallaxes '' do ) , nor does it require a cluster of stars ( as secular and statistical parallax do ) , nor a companion ( as orbital parallax does ) .",
    "trigonometric parallax is a geometric process , involving only the earth s orbital motion and the distance to the star , operating independently of any unusual or misleading properties a star might have .",
    "the primary compendia of trigonometric parallaxes are the general catalog of trigonometric stellar parallaxes , fourth edition @xcite , more commonly known as the yale parallax catalog ( ypc ) , and the _ hipparcos _ mission .",
    "the ypc is a compilation of 15994 parallax measurements for 8112 stars from various observatories , representing ground - based parallax efforts prior to 1995 for stars as faint as @xmath3 .",
    "the parallaxes have a broad range of errors , but most are between 2 and 20 milliarcseconds ( mas ) , as shown in figure [ fig : precision ] . the latest version of the _ hipparcos _ mission s catalog contains 117955 stellar parallaxes , generally with errors less than 1 mas for stars brighter than @xmath4 .",
    "these compendia have already enabled statistical studies of stellar formation , evolution , composition , kinematics , and populations , making detailed large - scale surveys like the geneva - copenhagen survey of f and g dwarfs , for example , finally possible .    despite the size of its catalog , _ hipparcos _",
    "did not find the complete population of nearby stars .",
    "the faint magnitude limit of _ hipparcos _ was @xmath5 , with a completeness limit of @xmath6 .",
    "populations of stellar types afgk within 100 pc were richly sampled by _ hipparcos _ , but intrinsically faint stars such as m dwarfs , cool subdwarfs , and white dwarfs largely remain the purview of the ypc , or of new ground - based efforts such as the one discussed here .",
    "a truly inclusive , volume - limited survey of all types of stars on the scale of the geneva - copenhagen survey is still not possible  large numbers of stars in the solar neighborhood are still unconfirmed , large numbers of m dwarfs are still missing from nearby star lists .",
    "the mission of recons ( research consortium on nearby stars ) is to understand the solar neighborhood , including the discovery , confirmation , and characterization of nearby stars and their environments .",
    "recons has been operating a trigonometric parallax program called ctiopi ( cerro tololo interamerican observatory parallax investigation ) at the ctio 0.9 m telescope since 1999 with a primary goal of pushing the parallax - verified solar neighborhood sample  systems within 25 pc , with a concentration on those within 10 pc  toward completion .",
    "this is the fifth paper of results from the ongoing program at the 0.9 m , following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; more details of the program can be found in the preceding references .",
    "while this paper does not finish off the sample of all stars in this proper motion range , it furthers the ctiopi goal of completing the census of the solar neighborhood .",
    "it contains 67 new trigonometric parallaxes of 64 systems with proper motions between 05 yr@xmath0 and 10 yr@xmath0 , our `` slowmo '' sample .",
    "of the 64 systems , 56 are within 25 pc of the sun , and all are south of dec@xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the parallaxes , we provide new measurements of proper motions , johnson - kron - cousins @xmath2 photometry , variability , spectral types , and astrometric measurements of multiple systems .",
    "completing the stellar census within 25 pc is a daunting task .",
    "if we assume the current census of systems within 5 pc is accurate ( 50 systems , see @xcite for the most recent additions within five pc ) and representative of the stellar space density of the solar neighborhood , we expect 6250 star systems within 25 pc .",
    "the most complete parallax - selected list of objects remains the nstars database , which includes only 2011 systems within 25 pc @xcite , indicating that the sample is only 32% complete .",
    "clearly , much more work is needed to achieve a truly comprehensive volume - limited sample of space ; only then will we truly be able to characterize the compositional nature of the galaxy .",
    "even the gaia mission , with a limiting magnitude of @xmath8 , will not reach the end of the main sequence past ten parsecs .",
    "the 64 systems discussed in this paper are listed in tables [ tab : astrometry ] and [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "they were selected for the ctiopi program for a variety of reasons : either their high proper motion made them targets for m. brown s masters thesis on slowmo systems , their estimated distances suggested they might be within 10 parsecs , or they had ypc parallaxes with large errors that placed the system within 10 parsecs .",
    "the systems themselves are all from @xcite , @xcite , , , , and a private communications with @xcite for apmpm j2127 - 3844 .",
    "most of them were investigated for companions in @xcite .",
    "all of the systems have proper motions of 0510 yr@xmath0 , have red dwarf primaries with @xmath9 10.3519.17 and have spectral types m1.0v to m6.0v .",
    "seven of the systems presented here have known or suspected companions ; we confirm six of them and present individual parallax measurements for components of three .",
    "we have also discovered evidence of multiplicity for a further three systems and suspect additional components in five more systems ; thus 14% ( 9 out of 64 ) of our systems are multiple , and 9% ( 5 out of 64 ) are suspected multiples .",
    "this sample builds upon our previous efforts that also revealed systems within 25 pc , including stars with @xmath10 10 yr@xmath0 @xcite ( our motion sample ) , red dwarfs within 10 pc @xcite , and white dwarfs within 25 pc @xcite from the ctiopi 0.9 m program , and mixed samples from our 1.5 m program @xcite .",
    "all astrometric and photometric observations were carried out at the ctio 0.9 m telescope , initially ( 1999 - 2003 ) under the aegis of the noao ( national optical astronomy observatory ) surveys program , and later ( 2003-present ) via the smarts ( small and moderate aperture research telescope system ) consortium .",
    "the observations presented in this paper were obtained between 1999 and 2009 utilizing the center 1024x1024 pixels of the 0.9 m telescope s tek 2048x2046 ccd and ctio s @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ( hereafter without subscripts ) , and @xmath12 are 5475 , 6425 , and 8075  , respectively . ] filters .",
    "additional details of the observing protocol can be found in @xcite .",
    "four significant instrumental events in the course of the ctiopi program have affected data published in this paper :    * in february 2005 , the tektronix # 2 @xmath13 filter ( hereafter `` old @xmath13 '' ) used by ctiopi cracked and was replaced by the almost - photometrically identical ( transmission properties and bandwidth ) tektronix # 1 @xmath13 filter ( hereafter `` new @xmath13 '' ) . with four years of new @xmath13 data , we are able to make some comparisons between the two : * in april 2005 , the telescope control system ( tcs ) on the 0.9 m was completely replaced and refurbished , yielding improved pointing and tracking .",
    "no astrometric effects have been detected in datasets spanning the tcs upgrade . * on 7 march 2009 , a power outage damaged the gain @xmath14 1 circuitry for the ccd , and ctiopi began using gain @xmath14 2 .",
    "the differences between the two gains are purely electrical , and tests confirm that the switch does not affect our astrometry , as expected . * in july 2009 , the old @xmath13 filter was returned to service .",
    "extensive tests showed the hairline crack near the edge does not affect data acquired on the central quarter of the ccd as used in ctiopi .",
    "furthermore , testing many stellar fields indicated no adverse effects on the astrometry when reducing data with and without recent data in the old @xmath13 filter .",
    "recent old @xmath13 filter data have been used in this paper s astrometric reductions of lhs 1050 , lhs 1561 , lhs 3443 , lhs 4009ab , and lhs 4016 .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic observations at two telescopes to determine the spectral types of 25 of the objects listed in table [ tab : photometry ] . from 20032006",
    ", we used the ctio 1.5 m , the r - c spectrograph with a loral 1200 @xmath15 800 ccd , and the 32/i grating to obtain spectra covering 60009500  at a resolution of 8.6 . for wt 244 and gj 438",
    ", we used the ctio 4 m , the r - c spectrograph with a loral 3x @xmath15 1k ccd , and the 181 grating to obtain spectra covering 550010000  at a resolution of 5.7 .",
    "further details concerning the 1.5 m spectroscopy program and associated data reduction can be found in @xcite , while details of the 4 m spectroscopy program can be found in @xcite .",
    "parallaxes and proper motions of 64 stellar systems are presented in table [ tab : astrometry ] .",
    "nine of our systems have multiple parallax measurements , from ypc , our ctiopi 1.5 m program , or multiple components published in this paper . for these cases",
    ", we present weighted average system parallaxes in table [ tab : weightedmeans ] .",
    "all parallax data were analyzed with the custom iraf / idl pipeline used in ctiopi publications since 2005 , using an iterative gaussfit program described in @xcite . starting in 2007 ,",
    "the reduction methodology was changed by the implementation of a new sextractor centroiding algorithm , described in @xcite .    as always , ctiopi parallaxes must meet several criteria before they are deemed fit to publish .",
    "first , to ensure good coverage of the parallax ellipse , there is an informal limit of 30 frames each in the ` morning ' and ` evening ' halves of the ellipse with a goal of having 20 usable frames each ; the number of frames used in the final reductions ranged from 45 ( lhs 2899 ) to 137 ( lhs 1630ab ) .",
    "second , the system must be followed for about two years to decouple the star s motion into parallax and proper motion ; the coverage in this paper varies from 1.99 years ( lhs 2335 ) to 10.15 years ( lhs 4009ab ) .",
    "third , ctiopi targets are expected to have parallax errors less than 3 mas before publishing .",
    "the smallest parallax error we are publishing here is 0.63 mas ( gj 1157 ) and the largest is 2.57 mas ( lhs 1050 and lhs 2122 ) , while the median error on these parallaxes is 1.37 mas .",
    "our parallaxes are derived by measuring the motion of the target star ( pi star ) relative to background reference stars , and then correcting the parallactic motion to an absolute reference frame with @xmath2 band photometric distance estimates to the reference star ensemble ( not to be confused with our @xmath16 distance estimates for red dwarfs , discussed in @xmath17[sec : photdistances ] ) .",
    "good reference star fields consist of at least five but rarely more than twelve stars that are as close as possible to the pi star on the ccd , have more than 1000 peak counts , and surround the pi star as much as possible .",
    "the most accurate parallaxes are obtained with exposures longer than 90 seconds , which is long enough at ctio for images in the @xmath2 bands to smooth over atmospheric effects and consequently improve centroids .",
    "we have also re - observed several systems ( e.g. lhs 1561 , lhs 3909 , and lhs 3443 ) after a multi - year hiatus to improve proper motions and possibly reveal long - period perturbations ( see @xmath17[sec : perturbations ] ) , otherwise the extra observations have a minor effect on the derived parallax .",
    "seven of our systems contain known multiples : lhs 1630ab , lhs 1749ab , lhs 1955ab , lhs 2567/2568 , lhs 3001/3002 , lhs 3739/3738ab , and lhs 4009ab .",
    "we have resolved orbital motion above the 3-@xmath18 level ( angular motion or changes in separation ) for five of those systems , as described in table [ tab : multiples ] .",
    "apart from lhs 1955ab , all values published in table [ tab : multiples ] are derived from at least three frames on the nights listed .",
    "the components of lhs 1630ab , lhs 1749ab and lhs 1955ab are close enough that their psfs ( point spread functions ) overlap . in the case of lhs 1630ab",
    "the b component was never fully resolved , but it does appear as an elongation to the psf .",
    "lhs 1749ab was only resolved on 15 frames from four nights .",
    "lhs 1955ab was only resolved on seven frames from five nights using restricted centroiding parameters that enabled the separation of blended sources ; the two frames from the earliest night and the one frame from the latest night are used to derive the results in table [ tab : multiples ] .",
    "errors presented in table [ tab : multiples ] include both measurement and systematic errors .",
    "the systematic errors were computed from the nights of data measured for table [ tab : multiples ] , with the exception of the three frames used for lhs 1955ab .",
    "all frames from a single visit ( one night of observations on one system ) were compared to the 2mass all - sky point source catalog using _ imwcs _ ; the standard deviations of the plate scales and rotations per - visit were then averaged across all visits to get a more representative error .",
    "systematics for the ctio 0.9 m on those frames give a 0.015% error in the plate scale ( and therefore separations ) , and a 0.0083 degree error in the rotation ( and therefore position angles ) . in all cases ,",
    "the measurement errors dominate the systematic errors .",
    "three of the systems discussed here  lhs 1582ab , lhs 2071ab , and lhs 3738ab  have been found to be previously undetected astrometric binaries , as shown in figures [ fig : lhs1582ab ] , [ fig : lhs2071ab ] , and [ fig : lhs3739 ] , respectively . for comparison , three additional stars  lhs 2021 , lhs 3739 and lhs 4009ab  are shown in figures [ fig : lhs2021 ] , [ fig : lhs3739 ] and [ fig : lhs4009ab ] .",
    "lhs 2021 and lhs 3739 appear to be single stars while lhs 4009ab is a known close binary that also appears single in our data .",
    "we re - observed lhs 4009ab several years after the parallax was finished to search for long - term perturbations ; none was found .",
    "all five systems are discussed in detail in @xmath17[sec : systemnotes ] .",
    "the ctiopi parallax reduction pipeline fits the astrometric positions of a star to a linear proper motion and a parallax ellipse of known shape and unknown size .",
    "any further motion caused by the orbit of a companion remains , appearing as a perturbation in the astrometric residuals . unlike an orbit determined by a technique that resolves two objects in a binary",
    ", an astrometric perturbation describes the orbit of the photocenter , not the motion of any individual component .",
    "( astrometric perturbations are therefore greater for larger magnitude differences between the components , larger companion masses , and larger semi - major axes of the orbits ; the photocenter of an equal - mass equal - luminosity binary will not move at all . )",
    "we can still solve for all orbital elements except semi - major axis . in its place",
    ", we can determine the semi - major axis of the photocentric orbit , which can then be scaled to the relative orbit if the system is resolved .",
    "photocentric orbital elements for the three new astrometric binaries were computed from the astrometric residuals using an iterative thiele - innes least - squares solver @xcite and are given in table [ tab : orbits ] .",
    "points from nights with only a single ccd image ( generally obtained for the purpose of photometry ) were removed .",
    "the orbits should be considered preliminary , as our astrometric datasets do not have sufficient time coverage to publish definitive orbits , particularly in the case of lhs 2071ab for which the orbit is not complete .",
    "lhs 2071ab and lhs 3738ab have now both been resolved through followup work , as discussed in @xmath17[sec : systemnotes ] .",
    "the parallaxes published in table [ tab : astrometry ] were computed from data where the photocentric orbit was removed .",
    "the orbital position of the photocenter was calculated and subtracted from the actual measured position of the photocenter at each data point , including those from nights with only a single ccd image .",
    "the parallax was then re - reduced based on this new dataset .",
    "ctiopi s detection capabilities are limited by several factors .",
    "systems are typically observed 14 times a year and thus the data are insensitive to periods less than a year .",
    "the program has only been running for ten years , and can not wrap orbits with periods longer than ten years .",
    "ctiopi also has a 36 mas nightly precision error ( depending on the specifics of the reference field ) that limits our sensitivity to low - amplitude binaries .",
    "fortunately , astrometric perturbations are typically self - confirming ; genuine orbital motion will show up in both the ra and dec axes unless the orbit is nearly north - south or east - west on the sky .",
    "nevertheless , to check for systematics within the field we have reduced the three brightest reference stars in each of our astrometric perturbation fields as if they were the parallax target . in only one case did a reference star showed a perturbation of any kind ; that reference was removed from the reduction of lhs 2071ab .",
    "the variability values in table [ tab : photometry ] are calculated according to the methodology of @xcite with additional details given in @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : photometry ] we list the level of variability in magnitudes ( column 8) of each target star in its parallax filter ( column 7 ) .",
    "the number of nights on which each star was observed ( column 9 ) and the number of frames ( column 10 ) used for the variability study are also given .",
    "although many m dwarfs are minutely variable , none of the stars in this sample have been found to vary by more than 2% in the frame series available .",
    "the single exception is lhs 1749ab at 0.028 mag . in this case ,",
    "the variability is likely due to the b component at a separation of 3  falling within the relative photometry aperture , and variations in seeing affecting the extracted fluxes .",
    "@xmath2 magnitudes are listed in table [ tab : photometry ] , along with extracted @xmath19 magnitudes from the two micron all sky survey catalog of point sources @xcite .",
    "the errors on the @xmath2 magnitudes are less than 0.05 mag for @xmath13 , and 0.03 mag for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with few exceptions , most notably the faint stars lhs 2021 and lhs 3002 .",
    "all photometric observations were reduced via a custom iraf pipeline and transformed onto a the johnson - kron - cousins system through the use of photometric standards from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , as described in @xcite .      for purposes of initial target selection as well as for additional analysis",
    "once trigonometric distances are determined , we used our ccd photometry combined with 2mass @xmath22 photometry to calculate the photometric distances listed in table [ tab : photometry ] ( columns 16 and 17 ) .",
    "the fourth - order polynomial fits for twelve color - absolute magnitude relations , the process by which the relations were determined , and the calculation of internal and external errors are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "our quoted photometric distances have internal errors ( defined as the standard deviation of the distances estimated from the twelve relations ) below 10% and an additional external systematic error of 15.3% .",
    "the distribution of internal errors is shown in figure [ fig : errors ] ; the average error is 3.9% , which is much smaller than the external errors .",
    "the errors listed for the photometric distances given in table [ tab : photometry ] include both internal and external errors .",
    "because the fits used for the photometric distance estimates are derived using main sequence stars , the estimates are only accurate when the objects are single , main - sequence , m dwarfs . for the most part , these systems are indeed single , and 54 of the 64 systems ( 84% ) fall within the 2-@xmath18 range when their combined internal and external errors are considered , as shown in figure [ fig : distances ] .",
    "stars above the 2-@xmath18 line in figure [ fig : distances ] are likely to be underluminous subdwarfs , while those below the 2-@xmath18 line are presumably overluminous multiples .",
    "there are no subdwarfs in this sample , ( although lhs 1050 , lhs 1807 , and lhs 3739/3738ab may be slightly metal - poor ) but there are several known close multiples with combined photometry , either previously known ( lhs 1630ab , lhs 1955ab , lhs 4009ab ) , or discovered by us ( lhs 1582ab , lhs 2071ab , lhs 3738ab ) .",
    "there is considerable scatter in @xmath23 along the main sequence , visible in figure [ fig : hrdiagram ] , with up to two full magnitudes of spread for early to mid m dwarfs .",
    "an equal magnitude binary will have a distance estimated to be 41% closer via photometry than is determined trigonometrically , but given the spread in @xmath23 in the main sequence , only further work will confirm or refute the multiplicity of suspected targets .",
    "spectral types are given in table [ tab : photometry ] , and come from five sources that can be arranged into two broad groups .",
    "one group is from recons spectroscopy , detailed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recons spectroscopy was used to determine the spectral types of all stars not taken from literature , and by @xcite to classify lhs 1807 .",
    "the remaining spectral types are from the palomar / michigan state university nearby star spectroscopic survey ( pmsu ) @xcite and related paper @xcite , all of which use the same weighted spectral indicies method linked to the spectral standards in @xcite . where recons classifications were done over a range of 60009000  with an effective resolution of 5.78.6  depending on the setup ( @xmath17[sec : spectroscopyobs ] ) ,",
    "the pmsu program used 62007500  with resolution 1.8 . in practice",
