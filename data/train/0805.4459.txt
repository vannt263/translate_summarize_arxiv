    "the presence of 110 million - k coronae and 10100 thousand - k chromospheres among all late - type stars , including the sun , is generally accepted to be the direct result of stellar magnetism .",
    "spatially - resolved observations of the solar surface , in fact , show a nearly linear correlation between x - ray brightness and magnetic flux that spans almost 12 orders of magnitude ( pevtsov et al .",
    "it is only in the case of the sun , of course , that magnetic fields have actually been seen in ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray images of its outer atmosphere . for every other star , magnetic activity can at present only be inferred from spectral proxies , e.g. , by the detection of uv emission lines or coronal x rays .",
    "it is also widely agreed that the origin of such activity among the dwarf stars of spectral types late - f through m lies deep within their interiors , through a dynamo process in which rotation interacts in an imperfectly understood way with turbulent convection .",
    "the process appears to operate most effectively in very young stars , which tend to rotate much more rapidly than the sun , in very low - mass stars with very deep convection zones , and in short - period binaries where tidal interactions enforce rapid rotation by synchronizing the spin and orbital motions of the stars .",
    "whether magnetic dynamos of a similar nature operate in early - type stars and are able to power a hot chromosphere and corona in those objects remains an open question .",
    "the two most popular mechanisms for heating the outer layers of low - mass stars like the sun  the dissipation of acoustic or magnetoacoustic waves , and microflaring of dynamo - generated turbulent magnetic fields  both require well - developed subsurface convection zones , which high - mass stars are thought to lack .",
    "according to stellar structure models , main - sequence a stars have vigorous convective cores , but the outer envelopes of those stars remain entirely radiative except for thin convective layers in the hydrogen and helium ionization zones at the base of the photosphere ( christensen - dalsgaard 2000 ; browning et al .",
    "2004 ; brun et al . 2005 ) . the computational and theoretical challenge , then , is to show that magnetic fields generated by dynamo action within the convective core can rise to the surface on a time scale that is short compared with the main - sequence lifetime of such a star ( macgregor & cassinelli 2003 ; see , however , macdonald & mullan 2004 ) and that such a process indeed leads to the formation of a hot chromosphere and corona .",
    "the possibility of dynamo activity in intermediate - mass and high - mass stars has been addressed by a variety of observations in recent years .",
    "observations by the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ and the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_at near - uv wavelengths have detected high - temperature chromospheric emission lines as far up the main sequence as @xmath7 , among the middle - a stars ( simon & landsman 1997 ) . farther up the main sequence , weak emission in the near - uv lines becomes much more difficult to detect against an increasingly bright stellar continuum . to extend the search to higher masses it is necessary to look to shorter wavelengths where the photosphere of an a star normally appears much darker .",
    "spectra at uv wavelengths shortward of ly@xmath1  have been obtained for a handful of middle- and early - a stars by the _",
    "far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ spacecraft ( simon et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the observations suggest a possible sharp cut - off in chromospheric emission and convection zones close to @xmath8 , near an effective temperature of @xmath9  k. although based on a small sample of stars , such a finding is entirely consistent with the predictions of theoretical models for the location of the radiative / convective boundary line in main - sequence stars ( ulmschneider et al .",
    "1996 ; christensen - dalsgaard 2000 ; kupka & montgomery 2002 ) .",
    "there are two significant weaknesses of the conventional stellar envelope models that are worth mentioning here .",
    "first , the models generally assume that the transfer of energy by convection in stars with shallow convection zones can be described by standard mixing - length theory ; and second , although the chemically normal a - type stars may rotate very rapidly ( in some cases close to their critical velocity ) , the models ignore the potential side - effects of axial rotation . in particular , recent interferometric observations of two",
    "rapidly rotating , spin - flattened stars , altair and @xmath1  cep , provide evidence for a difference of almost 2000  k between the surface temperatures at equatorial latitudes and those at the poles ( van belle et al .",
    "2001 , 2006 ; peterson et al .",
    "consequently , the outer envelope of a rapidly rotating star may become substantially convective in its cooler equatorial regions while its hotter polar regions remain completely radiative .",
    "recent theoretical models by macgregor et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show the same sorts of structural effects from rapid rotation , forming a deeper convective envelope with increasing rotation .",
    "thus , the notion of a distinct spectral - type or mass - based `` dividing - line '' between the main - sequence stars that have radiative envelopes and those that have convective envelopes may apply ( in a statistical sense ) only to the stars that rotate below a certain angular - velocity threshold .    a small minority of normal a stars in the field and in nearby open clusters have also been identified as coronal soft x - ray sources .",
    "cluster a stars have been detected by _",
    "rosat _ in deep surveys of the pleiades ( stauffer et al .",
    "1994 ) , the alpha persei cluster ( prosser et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the hyades ( stern et al .",
    "1995 ) , in a few instances at luminosities as high as @xmath4  @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 . by comparison ,",
    "the coronae of most ( single ) late - type stars in the neighborhood of the sun , including the sun itself , radiate much less than @xmath12 erg s@xmath11  in soft x rays ( maggio et al .",
    "1987 ; schmitt et al . 1995 ; hnsch et al .",
    "1998 ) . because the majority of cluster a stars are undetected in x rays , the emission of the detected stars could originate not from the a stars themselves , but from hidden late - type binary companions or from unrelated neighboring stars that happen to fall within the x - ray beam .",
    "long pointed observations with _",
    "einstein _ and short scans made during the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) of ostensibly single a stars or late - b stars in the field have also yielded a number of strong detections ( schmitt et al .",
    "1985 ; simon et al . 1995 ; berghfer et al . 1996 , 1997",
    "; hnsch et al .",
    "follow - up observations obtained at higher spatial resolution using the hri camera on _ rosat _ ( berghfer & schmitt 1994 ) or the acis camera on _ chandra _ ( stelzer et al . 2003 ) have confirmed the a or b star is coincident with the x - ray source in some cases , but in other cases have shown that the x  rays come from a nearby star while the a or b star appears totally dark in x rays .",
    "we note , of course , that even when the positions of the x - ray source and the a or b star closely agree , the identity of the source may not be determined with complete assurance , since it is normally difficult ( if not impossible ) to prove from an x - ray image alone that the emission is intrinsic to the a or b star and not from an unknown or unresolved ( possibly spectroscopic ) binary companion .    as one of the central predictions of the stellar structure models , the location along the main sequence where convective envelopes give way to radiative envelopes offers an important observational test of the physical models of main - sequence stars . at present , the two most commonly - used proxies for convection in stars give conflicting results for the location of that transformation , which need to be reconciled : the far - uv observations of chromospheric activity place the transition among the middle - a stars , whereas the x - ray observations of coronal emission place it distinctly farther up the main sequence , among the very early - a or late - b stars .",
    "it is essential to determine whether the radiative / convective boundary has been correctly identified by the uv observations or by the x - ray observations .",
    "however , observations of the chromospheric lines , which require spectra from _ fuse _ , have thus far been limited to a very small sample of a stars .",
    "the present study was therefore undertaken to extend the previous _ fuse _ survey , and it doubles the size of the sample over the critical range in  color and effective temperature where convection , and hence both chromospheric and coronal emission , are expected to vanish .",
    "our main observational goal was to measure accurate fluxes for the high - temperature subcoronal emission lines or to set stringent upper limits on the strengths of those lines .",
    "our sample is comprised of 14 main - sequence a stars .",
    "all of the stars have   colors in the range from 0.23 to 0.01 and optical spectra that are indicative of normal chemical abundances . a list of the stars observed with _ fuse _ can be found in table  [ tabparam ] .",
    "a journal of the _ fuse _ observations is provided in table  [ tabobs ] .",
    "seven stars from this sample were observed in the cycle 1 guest observer ( g.o . )",

    "those data , denoted in table  [ tabobs ] by the prefix a041 , have been reprocessed here with updated calibration software ( calfuse 3.1.3 ) .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath13  vel was obtained from the cycle 5 g.o .",
    "program of cheng and neff ( program i d e075 ) .",
    "the remaining six stars were observed by us in cycle 3 ( program i d c038 ) and are reported here for the first time . following the failure of a reaction wheel on _ fuse _ , which limited the declination range that could be accessed by the spacecraft , we observed two additional a - type stars , @xmath14 ara and @xmath15 lup , which were chosen to replace stars on our original target list .",
    "however , the bolometric luminosities of both replacement targets were subsequently determined to be much higher than those of the other 14 stars in our sample , and consequently they are omitted from the discussion that follows .",
    "we summarize the relevant parameters of all 14 _ fuse _ targets in table  [ tabparam ] .",
    "the spectral types , photometry , and parallaxes were extracted from the simbad  database .",

    "our @xmath2  estimates are generally within a few hundred kelvins of the values that were derived independently by allende prieto & lambert ( 1999 ) from stellar evolutionary calculations and those that were obtained by sokolov ( 1995 ) from the slope of the balmer continuum between 3200    and 3600   .",
    "the dispersion in temperature for individual stars is comparable to the random scatter of approximately @xmath16  k found by smalley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in the @xmath2values that were determined for a select group of a stars by a variety of techniques , including the infra - red flux method ( irfm ) , four - color photometry , balmer spectral line profile fitting , and fundamental measurements .",

    "chandra _ imaging of several _ rosat _ detected late - b stars has already shown ( stelzer et al . 2003 ) . the rass x - ray luminosities , along with the _ chandra _ luminosity we determined for hd129791 , @xmath4  @xmath19 erg s@xmath11 , make all of our _ fuse _ target stars much more active in x rays than the sun ( median @xmath4= 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath11 ; judge et al .",
    "2003 ) and , indeed , more active than every star in the young hyades cluster but three ( stern et al .",

    "we used simbad  as well as the palomar sky survey ( poss ) and 2mass images ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) to investigate the binary status of each star in table  [ tabparam ] .",
    "our working assumption is that the uv emission of a bright a star should dominate the light in a _ fuse _ spectrum and be less subject to the effects of source confusion from a faint binary companion than is the detection of x - ray emission from an x - ray image .",
    "the extent to which that critical assumption is borne out by the _ fuse _ observations is discussed below .",
    "two stars in table  [ tabparam ] , hd127971 and @xmath21  leo , are wide visual binaries , having a faint optical companion that is separated by a large enough distance ( 35  and 40 , respectively ) to ensure that the secondary falls outside the _ fuse _ science aperture ( lwrs : @xmath22 ) .",
    "the primaries are thus effectively single .",
    "three other stars in our sample , @xmath23  aur , @xmath13  vel , and @xmath24  uma , are noted as close visual binaries in the simbad  database . in each case , the binary separation is small enough ( 54 , 26 , and 45 , respectively ) and the secondary star is bright enough ( @xmath25 mags , respectively ) that the companion , if it is active , must be considered a possible source of the observed uv and x - ray emission .",

    "( 2000 ) and sahnow et al .",
    "the individual _ fuse _ observations listed in table  [ tabobs ] were all acquired in the normal time - tag mode through the lwrs large science aperture .",
    "the raw datasets were processed with version 3.1.3 of the calfuse calibration software ( dixon et al .",
    "2007 ) , which included screening the photon lists and adjusting the calibrated spectra to compensate for a variety of instrumental signatures ( e.g. , to exclude the times of burst events ) .",
    "two integration times are listed for each star , the first for the full exposure , the second for the nighttime portion of the _ fuse _ orbit , which normally experiences a lower level of contamination from terrestrial airglow ( feldman et al .",
    "2001 ) . for each of the four detector segments ( lif1a , lif2b , sic1a , and sic2b ) , we used calfuse to extract spectra from the `` good time intervals '' of the individual subexposures . before co - adding , we compared the subexposures to ensure that there were no `` drop - outs '' due to light loss out of the aperture .",
    "we also searched for evidence of substantial variation from one subexposure to the next .",
    "finally , we constructed light curves from the time - tagged data to search for flare - like variations of the emission .",
    "we found no evidence for flaring in any of the exposures .",
    "the resulting spectra were aligned in wavelength , co - added , and , being highly oversampled in wavelength , rebinned by 3 pixels to a resolution of @xmath28   as an aid in measuring the strengths of various emission lines .",
    "a coarser binning by 9 pixels was also applied to the co - added data in order to construct a broad uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for each star .",
    "figure  [ figsed ] presents composite spectra for the 14 stars in our full",
    "sample , arranged in order of increasing @xmath2as determined from the four - color photometry .",
    "shown here are the lif1a and lif2a detector segments , which have been stitched together to display wavelengths from the @xmath29 1032 , 1038 doublet to the multiplet at 1176  , except for a small gap in spectral coverage at 10801090  .",
    "apart from @xmath1  cep , the short pointings for the remaining stars are underexposed in the low - sensitivity sic channels shortward of the lines , so we have truncated the plots to exclude those wavelengths .",
    "the changes in sed from one star to the next are consistent with the ordering in @xmath2   established by the optical photometry , despite some discrepancies with the simbad  spectral types ( notably for hd43940 , which appears to have too early a spectral type , and hd11636 , or @xmath21  ari , which may be assigned a spectral type too late for its effective temperature ) .",
    "the `` cleanest '' high - temperature lines in the _ fuse _ spectra of chromospherically active late - type stars are normally @xmath30977 , @xmath301032 , and the @xmath301176 multiplet .",
    "@xmath301038 , the weaker component of the doublet , can be blended with both a terrestrial airglow feature and the redward component of the stellar @xmath291036 , 1037 doublet , as can be seen from inspection of the very high quality spectrum of capella published by young et al .",
    "analysis of a moderately high quality spectrum of the a7 v star altair ( redfield et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests similar line blending issues for that star as well .",
    "it is quite obvious from fig .",
    "[ figsed ] that for most stars the emission in @xmath301176 is bound to be overwhelmed by bright photospheric continuum .",
    "the photospheric continuum is substantially lower at the lines , and the wings of the lyman @xmath21 line further enhance the contrast between the emission lines and the continuum , particularly for the highest temperature targets in our program .",
    "the usefulness of the short wavelength spectra for the great majority of a - star targets in the present study is compromised by low snr at the 977    line .",
    "therefore , in the following we focus attention on the features , considering principally the stronger @xmath301032 component of the atomic doublet . in solar - type stars , these prominent emission features are thought to form in the transition region at a temperature of @xmath31300,000 k.      the integrated line fluxes and their associated 90% confidence level errors , or the appropriate flux upper limits , were measured for each star by modeling the emission line profile with a single gaussian component and by fitting both linear and quadratic terms to the underlying continuum .",
    "the best fit was determined by @xmath32 minimization .",
    "the complete fitting routine was implemented by means of customized software , which was written in the interactive data language ( idl ) , as described by neff et al .",
    "strong emission lines in the _ hst _  spectra and _ fuse _ spectra of late - type stars often show signs of a broad pedestal feature requiring a second gaussian component for a proper fit to the observed line profile ( wood et al .",
    "1997 ; ake et al . 2000 ; redfield et al .",
    "however , a double gaussian fit demands a much stronger line and a much higher signal - to - noise ratio than was achieved for any of the a stars except @xmath1  cep , whose spectra ( as we are about to show ) show no evidence for extended line wings .    the results of our measurements are presented in table  [ tabfits ] , which lists the integrated line fluxes for both components of the doublet and the line , the luminosity of the @xmath301032 line , the normalized ratio of the line luminosity to the bolometric luminosity of the star , and the ratio of the measured hwhm ( the half - width at half - maximum brightness ) to @xmath33 .",
    "detailed spectra of the lines are shown in figure  [ figo6 ] . in all but one case",
    ", the integrated fluxes were extracted from the lif1a segment , since the fine error sensor camera in the lif1 channel ( fes - a ) was the primary camera that was most often used for guiding on - orbit prior to july 2005 .",
    "observations made after that date , however , used the alternative fes - b camera in the lif2 focal plane assembly to maintain tracking within the science aperture .",
    "consequently , the fluxes of @xmath13  vel  were measured instead from the lif2b segment .",
    "no corrections have been made to the tabulated line fluxes for interstellar extinction , nor should they be needed for such nearby stars .    the stronger @xmath301032 component of the doublet is clearly detected in 11 of the 14 stars , which range in @xmath2from 7700 k to as much as 10,000 k. the weaker @xmath301038 component can be measured with confidence in 10 stars .",
    "it is expected to be intrinsically half as strong as the short wavelength component of the pair , yet is typically somewhat stronger than that , in part because it is difficult to make an accurate measurement of weak emission features in such lightly exposed spectra as ours , but also because of possible contamination from the nearby multiplet .",
    "the observed line ratio is particularly discrepant for hd159312 , for which the red component of the doublet is clearly the brighter feature , not only in the lif1a segment but also in the lif2b segment .",
    "the emission is distinctly blueshifted with respect to the nominal wavelength of @xmath301038 and likely is due to @xmath301037 line of .",
    "the asymmetric profile of the @xmath301038 line of @xmath1  cep  ( see fig .  [ figo6 ] ) shows unmistakable evidence for extra emission from in that star .",
    "the @xmath301037.02 line also appears weakly in emission in the spectrum of @xmath21  ari . for three stars ( @xmath24  cen , @xmath21  leo , and @xmath13  leo )",
    "there was no measurable line flux .",
    "upper limits were determined by fitting a constrained gaussian with its fwhm set to twice the @xmath33 of the star , its central peak fixed to match the largest signal in the immediate vicinity of the lines , and a background level set at approximately the lower envelope of fluctuations in the spectrum at nearby wavelengths .",
    "these three stars with only upper limits are among the optically brightest stars in our sample and are by no means the most distant ones observed .",
    "furthermore , the 13.3 ks integration time for @xmath24  cen  is one of the longest exposures of all the a stars , second only to the 53 ks spent observing @xmath1  cep . to within the uncertainties , our independent measurements of are in substantial agreement with those of simon et al .",

    "a significant offset from the a star s radial velocity would suggest that the emission originates from a companion or foreground star . because our exposure times were optimized to detect line emission , the continuum was always underexposed ( see fig .  [",

    "we further discuss this possibility in later sections .    in two cases , @xmath1  cep  and @xmath35  eri ,",
    "the widths of the observed line profiles are in excess of the rotational broadening , and the profiles are not well fitted with a single gaussian emission component .",
    "the fluxes , line widths , and uncertainties given in table  [ tabfits ] were determined from a series of multiple gaussian fits and from a numerical integration of the flux above a background fit .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath1  cep  shown in fig .",
    "[ figo6 ] bears a very close resemblance to the _ fuse _ spectrum of altair ( @xmath1  aql ) , which redfield et al .",

    "a similar distortion can be seen in the high signal - to - noise spectrum of the line of altair , which redfield et al .",
    "decompose into separate gaussian components .",
    "the box - like shape of the profiles of both stars is reminiscent of their @xmath301206 line in _ hst _  spectra ( simon & landsman 1997 ) . the profile of the @xmath301032 line of @xmath35  eri , a somewhat slower rotator than either altair or @xmath1  cep , exhibits a narrower width but a similar flat - top shape , although clearly at a much lower snr .",
    "uv and x - ray emission of a deeply convective late - type star increases with its axial rotation rate except at the very highest rotation speeds , while the emission of a thinly convective late - a or early - f star is entirely independent of its projected rotation speed ( ayres & linsky 1980 ; simon & fekel 1987 ; simon & landsman 1991 ) .",
    "this difference in the behavior of stars earlier and later than spectral type f5 has led to the suggestion that the activity of these two groups of stars may be produced by different mechanisms ( wolff et al .",
    "the x - ray and luminosities or normalized emission luminosities of the early a stars under investigation here likewise show no dependence on @xmath33 ( cf tables  [ tabparam ] and [ tabfits ] ) .",
    "although our sample is relatively small , the range in velocity is fairly wide , from a low value of 70 km s@xmath11   to a top value of 280 km s@xmath11 .",
    "consistent with the outcome of earlier studies , we find that both the coronal x - ray luminosity and the normalized x - ray luminosity of the a stars in this work are independent of the stellar rotation rate , @xmath33 .",
    "the same appears to be true of the uv emission in .",
    "therefore , if rapid rotation has the effect of deepening the outer convection zone of a stars , as suggested by the interferometric observations of altair and @xmath1  cep   ( e.g. , van belle et al .",
    "2001 , 2006 ) and also by the stellar models of macgregor et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and of promoting the formation of a convectively heated chromosphere or corona , we can point to no empirical evidence for that effect in the observations presented here . at the same time , if the activity of the a stars is powered by a shear dynamo that operates in the largely radiative portions of the envelopes of these a stars , as proposed by macdonald & mullan ( 2004 ) for the o and b stars , we would again expect to find a trend of increasing x - ray and uv emission with increasing rotation rate , which is not evident in our results .",
    "the possibility remains that the x - ray as well as the uv emission we observe from the a stars is produced by unrecognized and heretofore undetected companion stars .",
    "one example of such possible source confusion is provided by the active hyades f star , 71 tau ( hd28052 ) , whose chromospherically active companion was discovered in near - uv emission lines only by virtue of the high spatial resolution of _ hst _  ( simon & ayres 2000 ) .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ figo6 ] and table  [ tabfits ] suggests that relatively narrow uv emission lines predominate over the obviously rotationally - broadened profiles of @xmath1  cep   and @xmath35  eri , suggesting that the narrow emission features may originate not from the a stars but from more slowly rotating late - type companions .",
    "consider , for example , the 9 stars with @xmath2values hotter than 8300  k. @xmath24  cen  and @xmath21  leo  lack emission , and the measurement of hd159312 is uncertain because only the @xmath301032 line of was detected ( the @xmath301038 line was likely obscured by emission ) .",
    "of the remaining 6 stars , only hd129791 , an extremely rapid rotator like @xmath1  cep , has broad lines , and in that case the evidence is not definitive because the line emission is weak and the observation is underexposed .",
    "the remaining five stars ( 33  boo , @xmath23  aur , @xmath13  vel , @xmath47  oct , and @xmath21  ari ) all have narrow uv lines , of which three ( @xmath23  aur , @xmath13  vel , and @xmath21  ari ) are already known to have close optical or spectroscopic companions .",
    "any hidden low - mass secondary able to produce the powerful coronal emission of the x - ray selected a stars we have observed with _ fuse _ would have to be counted among the most active late - type stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume in the following discussion that any such active secondary is a very cool dwarf , either a dk or a dm star .",
    "young , rapidly rotating f and g dwarfs are also known to have x - ray luminosities as high as 10@xmath48 erg s@xmath11 , but owing to their higher mass would most likely have made their presence known by inducing radial velocity variations in the spectrum of the primary . as exemplars of possible active secondaries ,",
    "we choose ab  dor , a rapidly rotating early k dwarf ( @xmath49 km s@xmath11 ; zuckerman et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is the namesake of the ab dor moving group ( lpez - santiago et al .",
    "2006 ) , and au mic , a very young , nearby dm1e star with a dusty disk that is a likely member of the @xmath21  pic moving group ( barrado y navascus et al .",
    "both stars are luminous x - ray sources ( garca - alvarez et al .",
    "2005 ; hnsch et al .",
    "1999 ) , with @xmath4@xmath50 erg s@xmath11 , and also strong sources at ultraviolet wavelengths ( wood et al .",
    "1997 ; ake et al .",
    "2000 ; redfield et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the fluxes and emission line luminosities of both stars are listed in table  [ tabfits ] ( original data from redfield et al .",
    "2002 ) .    the uv emission line luminosities of ab  dor and au  mic are a suitable match to the @xmath5(ovi )  values of the active a stars that we have observed with _ fuse _ in all but 3 cases . the @xmath5(ovi )",
    "values for hd129791 and @xmath47  oct  are unquestionably on the high side , but the snr in the spectrum of hd129791 is quite modest and the detection of its emission is far from the most secure one in our survey .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath24  uma , a known binary and a star that is on the convective side of the radiative / convective boundary , is considerably weaker than that of either ab  dor or au  mic .",
    "instead , it is much more similar to the luminosity of the moderately active k2  v star @xmath51  eri , to which redfield et al .",
    "( 2002 ) assigned a flux that is equivalent to @xmath5(ovi )   @xmath52 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the two stars are also very similar , @xmath4= @xmath53 erg s@xmath11  for @xmath24  uma   and @xmath4= @xmath54 erg s@xmath11  for @xmath51  eri   ( hnsch et al .",
    "there is currently no reason to believe that a star as cool as the a star primary in @xmath24  uma   can not support a chromosphere as well as a corona , but if the high - energy emission observed in this system does come from a companion star , then the secondary ( or the secondaries ) needs to be mildly but not excessively active .",
    "the foregoing results are summarized in table  [ tabtruth ] in the form of a `` truth table . ''",
    "a check mark next to the name of a star signifies that the proposition stated at the head of a column is true , otherwise it is false or not determinable from the available data .",
    "if we exclude both @xmath1  cep  and @xmath35  eri , for which there is little doubt that the x - ray and uv activity is intrinsic to the a star , the detection of strong x - ray emission that is consistent with an active dk / dm star then appears to be a sufficient condition for the presence of uv emission at an intensity level that is also expected for a dk / dm star ; moreover , with but one exception ( i.e. , @xmath21  ari , which is a known binary ) , it is also a necessary condition .",
    "the commonality of the narrow uv line widths is suggestive of a binary origin of the observed emission , but is not conclusive .",
    "narrow lines could also arise from a high - latitude distribution of active regions , perhaps related to polar spots often seen in the photospheres of active , late - type stars .",
    "a further clue as to the origin of the emission can be found , however , in a comparison of the x - ray luminosity with the luminosity .",
    "the ratio of the two , @xmath4/@xmath5(ovi ) , serves as a rough gauge of the differential emission measure between the middle chromosphere and the corona , and is known to be much larger for an extremely active star like ab  dor or au  mic than for a low - activity star like the sun . for the former the ratio is @xmath31130 and @xmath31225 , respectively ; for the quiet sun it is @xmath315 ; and for a late a - type star like altair , which is an example of a higher - than - solar mass star with an `` x - ray deficit '' ( simon & drake 1989 ) , it is @xmath311 . among the 9 hottest stars in our sample of a stars",
    "whose effective temperatures formally place them above the radiative / convective dividing line at 8300  k , six have supersolar @xmath4/@xmath5(ovi )  ratios in the range of 25160 , only one of them ( the double - line spectroscopic binary @xmath21  ari ) has a solar or subsolar ratio , and two ( @xmath24  cen  and @xmath21  leo ) have only upper limits in both values and hence an indeterminate x - ray - to - uv luminosity ratio . among the 5 stars with @xmath2@xmath55",
    "k , two have supersolar ratios ( hd43940 , 235 ; @xmath24  uma , 30 ) , two others have solar or subsolar ones ( @xmath35  eri  and @xmath1  cep ) , and one has dual upper limits and thus an undefined ratio ( @xmath13  leo ) .",
    "of our 14 main - sequence a - type stars , 11 exhibit detectable emission , while restrictive upper limits were determined for the other 3 stars . the stars with span the entire range of @xmath2 , including the range above the presumed convective / radiative `` dividing line '' around 8300  k. if this sample is representative , and if the emission indeed arises from the a star , then current models of stellar activity must be revised to explain magnetic activity in stars without a substantial convective zone .",
    "however , we present several lines of evidence that lead to the conclusion that the emission from the higher - temperature stars in our sample is more likely due to very active late - type dwarf binary companions .",
    "the results of our expanded sample are therefore consistent with the observational findings of simon et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which demonstrate a pronounced decrease in uv emission at @xmath3  k , and also with the theoretical predictions of the current standard models of stellar structure .",
