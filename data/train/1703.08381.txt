    ", the `` tidal stirring '' model @xcite posits that gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions with mw - sized hosts can transform rotationally supported dwarfs , resembling present - day dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) , into systems with the kinematic and structural properties of dsphs .",
    "our study expands upon all previous investigations of tidal stirring in one major respect ; the inclusion , for the first time , of the combined effects of ram - pressure stripping and supernova ( sn ) winds driving gas bulk motions and outflows .",
    "such winds can directly affect the mass distribution of dwarf galaxies , significantly decreasing their total central density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , any physical process ( e.g. , ram - pressure stripping ) that can cause the removal of gas in dwarfs may reduce the inner density of their dm halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this improvement in the modeling may be vital to tidal stirring .",
    "indeed , systems with lower central densities are characterized by longer internal dynamical times and are thus expected to respond more impulsively to external tidal perturbations and suffer stronger tidal shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , rotationally supported dwarfs with decreased central densities due to baryonic effects may experience increasingly probable and efficient transformations into dsphs .    here",
    "we explore this qualitative expectation via a series of tidal stirring simulations of disky dwarfs with varying fractions of their disk mass in gas .",
    "our results indicate that the likelihood and efficiency of transformation into a dsph are both enhanced significantly when the progenitor rotationally - supported dwarfs are gas - rich , with gas fractions that are in accordance with those inferred from observations and recent theoretical efforts in dwarf galaxy formation .",
    "this finding further establishes tidal stirring as a prevalent evolutionary mechanism for shaping the structure of dwarf galaxies within the currently favored cdm cosmological paradigm .",
    "we employed the technique of @xcite to create self - consistent n - body realizations of rotationally supported dwarf galaxies consisting of exponential , baryonic disks embedded in cuspy , cosmologically - motivated @xcite dm halos .",
    "our goal is to elucidate the degree to which dsph formation via tidal stirring is affected by the presence of a gaseous component in the disk of the progenitor rotationally supported dwarf .",
    "to accomplish this , we varied the fraction of the disk mass in gas , @xmath2 , in three otherwise identically initialized disky dwarf galaxies ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath6 are well - motivated as they are akin to those of both observed dirrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simulated , realistic dirr - like systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    following @xcite , we first generated the dwarf model with a purely stellar disk ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "subsequently , we converted a fraction @xmath2 of randomly selected stellar particles in the dwarf disk into gas particles , without changing their positions and masses @xcite .",
    "gas particles were set on tangential orbits , with the dynamical equilibrium achieved by enforcing vertical pressure support to the disk , and by correcting their tangential velocities for the radial component of the pressure gradient force .",
    "each dwarf comprised a dm halo with a virial mass of @xmath8 , a choice that is motivated by theoretical studies of the mass distribution of satellites that could correspond to present - day dsphs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "informed by the same investigations , we constructed our dwarfs considering a @xmath9 infall redshift onto the primary . the virial radius and the median concentration value for a @xmath9 cosmological halo at this mass scale are @xmath10  kpc and @xmath11 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all dwarf galaxies hosted an identical , exponential baryonic disk whose mass , sech@xmath12 vertical scale - height , and central radial velocity dispersion were @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively @xcite . assuming a dimensionless halo spin parameter of @xmath16 yields a disk radial scale - length of @xmath17  kpc @xcite .",

    "we checked the adequacy of our dwarf models by evolving them for several gyr in isolation ( using an adiabatic equation of state for the gas - rich dwarfs ) and confirming that they retained their equilibrium configuration .    for simplicity , we assumed a single host represented by a self - gravitating , high - resolution mw model @xcite . to explore the effect of ram pressure",
    ", we included an extended , non - rotating halo of hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium inside the primary galaxy @xcite and with properties consistent with mw observations @xcite .",

    "this is relevant as a stronger cosmic uv background is expected to augment rampressure stripping by enhancing gas heating and ionization . in the latter set of simulations",
    ", we only modified the time evolution of the intensity of the cosmic uv background to reflect a @xmath23 accretion epoch . to avoid introducing an additional parameter ,",
    "the internal structure of the disky dwarf was explicitly not altered in these cases .",
    "we note that in all experiments described above ( s1s20 ) , the alignments between the internal angular momenta of the dwarfs , that of the primary disk , and that of the orbital angular momenta , were all _ mildly _ prograde and equal to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "lastly , we explored the importance of the initial inclination of the dwarf disk with respect to the orbital plane by placing model @xmath25 on orbit o1 and changing the default value from @xmath26 to @xmath27 and to @xmath28 ( s21s22 ) .",
    "these two configurations correspond to a perfectly edge - on and a perfectly face - on disk and bracket the range of possible amplitudes for the ram - pressure force .",

    "a uniform , time - variable cosmic uv background , causing the photoionization and photoheating of the gas , was implemented using the @xcite model .",
    "we incorporated the effects of sf and sn feedback ( `` blastwave '' scheme ) according to @xcite .",
    "these recipes are characterized by several parameters , including the gas density threshold for sf , @xmath29 , and we adopted the relevant values from @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our high sf density threshold ( @xmath30 atoms @xmath31 ) enables the development of a realistic clumpy , inhomogeneous ism , where sf and energy injection from sn explosions occur in a clustered fashion .",
    "as we demonstrate below , this has profound consequences on dsph formation via tidal stirring .",

    "in addition to illustrating the continuous decrease of the dwarf masses by the primary tidal field , this figure demonstrates that stripping of the total mass depends sensitively on @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , while mass loss from the inner regions of the collisionless dwarf galaxies is relatively gentle and gradual , stripping is significantly boosted for gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "the strongest episodes of mass loss coincide with pericentric passages , where ram - pressure stripping is also maximal . at such times , the differences with the collisionless simulations are remarkable and become even more pronounced with higher gas fractions .",
    "the rapid removal of gas via ram pressure , aided by sn explosions , reduces swiftly the central densities of the gas - rich disky dwarfs .",
    "therefore , these systems should respond more impulsively to tides and experience stronger tidal effects relative to their collisionless counterparts .",
    "indeed , in the impulse approximation , tidal shocks lead to an energy increase given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 corresponds to the total dwarf mass within a characteristic radius @xmath39 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . owing to ram - pressure stripping , at a given distance @xmath39 from the center of our dwarfs , increasing gas fractions correspond to smaller @xmath38 , and thus to larger @xmath40 ; hence , the gas - rich dwarfs suffer more effective tidal shocks , which explains both their enhanced mass loss and augmented morphological transformation into dsph - like systems .",
    "taking into account adiabatic corrections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) strengthens this conclusion . indeed , for less concentrated mass distributions , adiabatic corrections result in even larger @xmath40 compared to those predicted by the impulse approximation .",
    "apart from amplifying ram - pressure stripping , sn winds play another crucial role in causing the gas - rich dwarfs to exhibit a more impulsive response to tides .",
    "this role is revealed in figure  [ fig2 ] , which shows that the @xmath7 dwarf galaxies reach their first pericenter , thus in the absence of any tidal shocks , already with reduced total central mass .",
    "such a decrease is due to rapid gas outflows at sub - kiloparsec scales , driven by multiple sn explosions , which induce strong and repeated fluctuations in the dwarf gravitational potential .",
    "such fluctuations result in energy transfer to the collisionless components ( dm and stars ) , significantly lowering the total central densities of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the increased sf",
    ", the overall effect of sn winds is expected to be stronger for higher gas fractions . in conjunction with the impact of ram pressure",
    ", this naturally explains the trend of augmented transformation efficiency with larger @xmath2 .",
    "the present study is the first to elucidate the combined effects of radiative cooling , ram - pressure stripping , sf ( based on a high gas density threshold ) , sn feedback , and a cosmic uv background on the tidal stirring mechanism for the origin of dsphs .",
    "we have shown that , regardless of orbit inside the primary galaxy , gas - rich ( @xmath41 ) rotationally supported dwarfs exhibit a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of transformation into dsphs relative to their collisionless ( @xmath42 ) counterparts ( columns 711 ; table  [ table : summary ] ) . such large values of @xmath2 are akin to those of observed dirrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the morphology - density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an essential constraint that any theoretical model for the lg must satisfy , may naturally arise in the context of the tidal stirring model .",
    "we gauged the effect of ram pressure on our results by repeating simulation s8 without the hot gas halo in the host . in the absence of ram pressure , the gas was not entirely stripped from the dwarf ( @xmath43 of the original gas content still remained bound ) . with the obvious caveat that we only explored a single orbit , this experiment suggests that ram pressure is required for the formation of bona fide dsphs via the tidal stirring of gas - rich rotationally supported dwarfs .",
    "our finding that gravitational tides alone , although aided by sn feedback in our case , can not entirely remove the gas components from dwarfs , is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "in addition , we ascertained how the transformation process depends on sn feedback by resimulating experiment s8 without this effect .",
    "the absence of sn explosions resulted in a notably decreased efficiency of dsph formation , with the timescales of ram - pressure stripping becoming significantly longer ( see , also , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , complete gas removal now takes place at @xmath44  gyr ( and after four pericentric passages ) , compared to @xmath45  gyr ( and after two pericentric passages ) in the original simulation s8 .",
    "this highlights the vital role of sn winds in enabling rapid ram - pressure stripping by making cold gas more loosely bound and by carving holes in the ism with expanding bubbles that increase ablation effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the exclusion of sn feedback did not affect the overall likelihood of transformation , as a bona fide dsph still formed , it did influence the degree of transformation .",
    "indeed , the final values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 were equal to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ( compared to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , when sn feedback was included ; see table  [ table : summary ] ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the less complete transformation in this case is attributed to both the less efficient ram - pressure stripping and the absence of gas outflows from sn winds , causing a more adiabatic response of the disky dwarfs to tidal effects .",
    "previous work on tidal stirring that did not include sn explosions indicated that the timescales of ram - pressure stripping , and consequently those of dsph formation , were sensitive to the presence of a cosmic ionizing background ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we examined this assertion by repeating simulation s8 without the cosmic uv and found that its absence had virtually no effect on either the timescales of ram - pressure stripping or on the efficiency , likelihood , and degree of transformation .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in the experiments with a stronger cosmic uv background ( s18s20 ; table  [ table : summary ] ) .",
    "these results again underscore the fundamental importance of sn feedback as the primary heating mechanism for the gas and the main effect that facilitates ram - pressure stripping .",
    "we also investigated whether the alignment between the internal and orbital angular momentum of the dwarfs can affect their transformation . to this end , we repeated simulations s1 and s8 , adopting a _ mildly _ retrograde alignment of @xmath52 .",
    "the analysis of these experiments showed that the collisionless disky dwarf does not transform into a dsph ( see , also , @xcite ) , highlighting the importance of coupling between orbital and internal motions ; however , its gas - rich counterpart does experience transformation , although with significantly decreased efficiency ( @xmath53  gyr , as opposed to @xmath54  gyr in the prograde simulation ; table  [ table : summary ] ) .",
    "in addition , the ram - pressure stripping timescales were longer and the degree of transformation was substantially weaker in the retrograde case .",
    "mildly retrograde alignments thus seem to support the general picture presented in this study .",
    "earlier tidal stirring studies established a strong association between the development of long - lived bars in the disks of the progenitor disky dwarfs and dsph formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". nonetheless , with the prominent exception of the lmc , the number of irrefutable bar - like distortions observed in lg dwarfs is extremely low ( see , however , @xcite ) , challenging the overall predictive power of the tidal stirring model .",
    "interestingly , our results indicate that bar formation is not a _ necessary _ condition for the transformation of rotationally supported gas - rich dwarfs via tidal stirring ( column 6 ; table  [ table : summary ] ) , alleviating the tension between observations and theoretical predictions . in these cases , the lower stellar mass fractions , which correspond to a lower self gravity of the tidally perturbed stellar disk ,",
    "prevent the development of a bar , and dsph - like systems are produced only via tidal heating .",
    "lastly , our findings demonstrate a correlation between the amount of residual gas in the dwarfs and their degree of transformation into dsphs ( table  [ table : summary ] ) .",
    "specifically , total gas stripping is required for the most complete transformations , while the presence of gas is associated with objects that maintain , at least partially , the properties of their disky progenitors ( s10 , s17 , s20 ) .",
    "the latter finding is particularly relevant to the `` transition - type '' dwarfs ( e.g. , phoenix , pegasus , and lgs3 ) , which share properties with both dsphs and dirrs @xcite .",
    "one possibility for their origin is that their progenitors were disky satellites that were only recently accreted by their hosts on very wide , radial orbits .",
    "these transition - type dwarfs could therefore still be in the process of being transformed into dsphs by tidal stirring , having concluded one pericentric passage and having some of their gas removed via ram pressure .",
    "in fact , ram - pressure stripping has been proposed to explain the presence of @xmath55 clouds in the vicinity of phoenix @xcite . in the aforementioned scenario ,",
    "transition - type dwarfs should possess appreciable stellar rotation , having been only partially transformed .",
    "although recent studies have reported significant rotation in both pegasus @xcite and phoenix @xcite with @xmath56 , irrefutable evidence of substantial rotation in these systems would be required to validate our prediction .",
