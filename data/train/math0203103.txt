    "throughout the paper , @xmath0 will be a compact oriented surface .",
    "the results automatically extend to non - orientable surfaces by considering their orientation coverings , and also extend to surfaces with cusps through minor rephrasings of the arguments . as indicated in the introduction ,",
    "a hyperbolic metric @xmath1 on @xmath0 defines a transverse measure @xmath7 for the geodesic foliation @xmath5 of @xmath3 .",
    "recall that a transverse measure is the assignment of a radon measure on each surface @xmath23 transverse to @xmath5 , in a way which is invariant under the holonomy of @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , a transverse measure locally is a measure on the space of leaves of @xmath5 in local charts for @xmath0 , so that these measures agree when charts overlap .",
    "globally , the space of leaves of @xmath0 is not hausdorff , so it is convenient to lift the situation to the universal covering @xmath42 of @xmath0 .",
    "lift the hyperbolic metric @xmath1 to a hyperbolic metric on @xmath43 , which we will still denote by @xmath1 .",
    "the geodesic foliation @xmath44 of @xmath45 defined by this metric projects to the geodesic foliation @xmath5 of @xmath3 . because @xmath42 is simply connected and @xmath1 has negative curvature , every geodesic is globally length minimizing , and it follows that @xmath44 has no recurrent leaves . as a consequence , the space of leaves of @xmath46 is hausdorff .",
    "this space of leaves is also the space @xmath47 of all oriented bi - infinite geodesics of @xmath42 .    to work with @xmath48 , it is convenient to consider the _ circle at infinity _ @xmath49 of @xmath42 .",
    "recall that @xmath49 is the quotient of the set of geodesic rays of @xmath42 under the equivalence relation which identifies two rays when they stay at bounded distance from each other .",
    "if we pick a base point @xmath50 in @xmath42 , each equivalence class has a unique representative among the geodesic rays issued from @xmath50 , which identifies @xmath49 to the unit tangent space @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , this identification @xmath52 defines a metric on @xmath49 , the _ angle metric _ based at @xmath50 .",
    "every geodesic of @xmath43 has two distinct end points on the circle at infinity @xmath49 , and any couple of distinct points of @xmath49 is obtained in this way .",
    "this identifies the space @xmath47 of oriented geodesics of @xmath42 to the open annulus @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the diagonal .    a _ measure geodesic current _ on @xmath0 , namely a transverse measure for the geodesic foliation @xmath5 in @xmath3 , lifts to a transverse measure for the geodesic foliation @xmath46 in @xmath55 .",
    "it globally defines a measure on the space @xmath56 of leaves of @xmath46 , since no leaf of @xmath57 is recurrent .",
    "note that this measure is invariant under the natural action of the fundamental group @xmath58 .",
    "this identifies the space @xmath10 of measure geodesic currents to the space of @xmath58invariant measures on @xmath47 .",
    "if one replaces the metric @xmath1 by another hyperbolic metric @xmath4 on @xmath0 and the base point @xmath50 by another point @xmath59 , every @xmath4geodesic ray issued from @xmath60 in @xmath42 is quasi - geodesic for @xmath1 , and therefore stays at bounded distance from a unique @xmath1geodesic ray issued from @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that the circle at infinity @xmath49 is actually independent of the hyperbolic metric @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , from the quasi - geodesic property and from easy curvature estimates , the two angle metrics @xmath61 and @xmath62 on @xmath49 which are respectively associated to @xmath1 and the base point @xmath50 and to @xmath4 and the base point @xmath60 are _ hlder equivalent _ in the following sense : there exists constants @xmath63 and @xmath64 such that @xmath65 for every @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",

    "hlder geodesic current _ on @xmath0 is a linear map @xmath76 which is invariant under the action of @xmath58 , and which is continuous in the sense that its restriction to each @xmath69 is continuous for the norm @xmath77 .",
    "note that this notion is independent of the choice of the negatively curved metric @xmath1 on @xmath0 , because the distance @xmath61 on @xmath47 is well - defined up to hlder equivalence .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the space of hlder geodesic currents , endowed with the weak * topology defined by the family of semi - norms @xmath78 as @xmath21 ranges over all the elements of @xmath74 .",

    "this isometry induces hlder bicontinuous homeomorphisms @xmath82 and @xmath83 which , to avoid the proliferation of symbols , we will also denote by @xmath84 .    then the liouville geodesic current is the measure @xmath85 on @xmath47 which is the pull back by @xmath84 of the liouville geodesic current @xmath86 on @xmath87 .    to compute @xmath86 , consider the poincar disk model for the hyperbolic plane @xmath81 , namely the open unit disk @xmath88 with the metric which at @xmath89 is @xmath90 times the euclidean metric .",

    "the liouville geodesic current @xmath7 considered here is twice that of @xcite , to make it more directly related to the volume form of @xmath3 .",
    "also , @xmath47 denotes here the space of _ oriented _ geodesics of @xmath42 .",
    "we summarize here the basic properties of the shearing coordinates for teichmller space which we will need .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "these shearing coordinates are associated to the choice of a maximal geodesic lamination @xmath105 on @xmath0 .",
    "recall that , for an arbitrary metric of negative curvature on @xmath0 , a _",
    "geodesic lamination _ is a closed subset of @xmath0 which can be decomposed as a union of disjoint complete geodesics which have no self - intersection points .",
    "such a notion is actually a topological object , independent of the metric , in the sense that there is a natural identification between @xmath1geodesic laminations and @xmath4geodesic laminations for any two negatively curved metrics @xmath1 and @xmath4 . a geodesic lamination is _ maximal _ if it is maximal for inclusion among all geodesic laminations , which is equivalent to the property that the complement @xmath106 consists of finitely many infinite triangles .",

    "each pair of pants can be divided into two infinite triangles by three infinite geodesics spiralling around some boundary components .",
    "the union of @xmath107 and of these spiralling geodesics forms a maximal geodesic lamination @xmath105 .",

    "we will see that , as we let the spanning family @xmath159 uniformly tend to infinity , the last term @xmath219 of equation  [ eqn : conjpartialshear ] vanishes in the limit .",

    "the main technical point of our arguments is to prove that the infinite sums of equations  [ eqn : conjfullshear ] and [ eqn : conjpartialshear ] do converge and , unlike the above formal computations , will strongly use the hypothesis that the function @xmath21 is hlder continuous .",

    "<S> presumably , one could alternatively use more classical coordinates for @xmath9 , such as the fenchel - nielsen coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> however , this seems harder to do and the shearing coordinates have the definite technical advantage that one only has to deal with shearing as opposed to mixing lengths and shearing .    </S>",
    "<S> dragomir ari has recently developed a new approach @xcite to the results of this article . </S>",
    "<S> it is somewhat more direct , and has the additional advantage of extending to ( infinite dimensional ) teichmller spaces of surfaces with infinite area , and in particular to the universal teichmller space . </S>",
    "<S> to some extent , the occurrence of hlder geodesic currents in this infinite dimensional setting is somewhat surprising , as one could have expected distributions with a lower level of regularity .    </S>",
