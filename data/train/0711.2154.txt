    "the early stages of star formation are known to occur deep inside interstellar clouds of dust and molecular gas .",
    "this is particularly true when massive protostars are produced : the hydrogen - burning reactions in a high - mass protostar are ignited while the object is still accreting and deeply embedded in its parent cloud .",
    "hence , due to its much higher energy output , it stirs and heats up the natal core in a much more effective way than a low - mass object , giving rise to a hot molecular core .",
    "this stage of high - mass star formation is characterized by processes that occur in the dense and heated ( to @xmath2 100 k ) surroundings of the protostar : ice mantles around dust grains evaporate and the frozen molecules are thereby released into the gas phase . due to the high temperature and density , the molecules are easily excited , and due to the large column densities , they can readily be observed . since hot cores display a plethora of molecular lines ( see figure  [ fig : spec798 ] )",
    ", they can be studied very well using molecular lines , particularly of highly excited transitions ( for a review , see e.g. van der tak 2004 @xcite ) .",
    "although molecular line studies of hot cores are quite popular at mm and lower submm wavelengths ( e.g. hatchell et al . 1998 @xcite ) , a systematic study of all submm atmospheric windows has , so far , only been carried out for orion - kl with the cso ( 350 and 650 ghz , schilke et al . 1997 @xcite , 2001 @xcite ; 850 ghz , comito et al . 2005",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "often considered a template for the study of the hot - core phase of massive star formation , orion - kl is in fact not representative at all :    * the mass involved , 10 @xmath3 , is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the mass of many other massive hot cores ( e.g. g10.47 , olmi et al .",
    "1996 @xcite ) , and its extremely strong molecular lines are due mostly to its proximity ( i.e. , to the relatively large beam filling factors ) ; * its anomalous geometry ( cf . the `` blister '' model , genzel & stutzki 1989 @xcite ) may result in an abnormally low dust opacity along the line of sight , a condition that is not representative of `` typical '' hot - core sources .",
    "in fact , for a typical h@xmath4 column density of @xmath5 @xmath6 , * the dust opacity @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , will become @xmath2 1 at a frequency of about 550 ghz*. thus , while orion does look similar to many other hot cores at frequencies of @xmath9 ghz , an extrapolation to shorter wavelengths is by no means obvious ( see figure  [ fig : dust ] ) .",
    "molecular observations of massive ( @xmath2 100 m@xmath10 ) cores in the 690 or 850 ghz ( 450 or 350 @xmath11 m ) band are thus likely to show not only quantitative but also qualitative differences with respect to lower - frequency observations .",
    "at least two scenarios may be encountered :    \\(i ) a geometrically straightforward one , where the observed object is spherical in shape and isotropic in density structure . in this case",
    ", the high dust opacity at 350/450 @xmath11 m will obscure the innermost , hottest and densest regions of the hot molecular core , while opening the path to absorption - line studies of the outer envelope .",
    "\\(ii ) one in which the hot - core component is actually made up by a cluster of high mass clumps . here , in spite of the high nominal h@xmath4 column densities ( hence high @xmath12 )",
    ", the radiation from close to the central object(s ) could still be observable , since the radiation can leak out between the clumps .",
    "the same applies to many non - spherical geometries ( e.g. face - on disks , hollow outflow cones ) .",
    "scenario ( i ) above would be bad news for high - frequency alma observations , but it would be fatal for planned high frequency herschel / hifi surveys , which will extend to even higher frequencies , 1.9 thz , corresponding to a wavelength of 150 @xmath11 m . of course , one would not lose all spectral features , since low excitation lines would still show up in absorption and would provide valuable information ( similar to the ir absorption lines ) , but the direct view to the central engine would be blocked .",
    "to discern between the proposed scenarios , and to help selecting suitable objects for the herschel / hifi spectral scan key project , we observed the vibrationally excited hcn(9 - 8 , @xmath0 ) line at 797 ghz .",
    "because of its high critical density ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) , this transition can hardly be excited by collisions , but can be pumped by 14 @xmath11 m ir radiation ( corresponding to the the energy of the @xmath0 state ) which is emitted by warm ( @xmath2 150 k ) dust ( carroll & goldsmith 1981 @xcite , hauschildt et al . 1993 @xcite ) .",
    "it therefore comes from either unusually dense and warm clumps or from regions of a high ir radiation field , i.e. the line originates most likely from close to the central star .    using the flash ( heyminck et al .",
    "2006 @xcite ) and apex-2a ( risacher et al .",
    "2006 @xcite ) instruments on apex ( gsten et al . 2006",
    "@xcite ) , we observed the @xmath15=9 - 8 and 4 - 3 transitions in the @xmath16=0 and 1 vibrational states , as well as the 4 - 3 transition of h@xmath17cn and hc@xmath18n . using two fast fourier",
    "transform spectrometers ( klein et al .",
    "2006 @xcite ) as backends , three 1.8 ghz wide bands were covered , centered around 798/810 , 342/354 and 345/357 ghz ( see figure  [ fig : spec798 ] as an example ) .",
    "the source sample consists of 10 hot cores ( see figure  [ fig : hcnlines ] plus 17233 - 3606 and w33a ) .",
    "the hcn(4 - 3 , @xmath0 ) should not suffer significantly from high dust opacities at 850 @xmath11 m and can be used to calibrate the intrinsic strength of the lines .",
    "we found evidence for the ( 9 - 8 , @xmath0 ) line toward all sour- ces where the ( 4 - 3 , @xmath0 ) was detected , indicating that , at least at this wavelength and for this source sample , the central core is still visible .",
    "hence alma observations of the central engines of hot cores even at the highest frequencies appear to be feasible , although the cores may shut down at higher frequencies relevant for herschel / hifi .",
    "the ground state lines often display self - absorption features .",
    "their asymmetric line shapes with the blue part being the stronger one could be indicative of infall motion . to extract the information on the source structure from the line strengths and shapes , we plan to analyze the data with detailed radiative transfer modeling ( hogerheijde & van der tak 2000 @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary results indicate that modelling the source as a spherical cloud can not reproduce all observed lines , indicating deviations from this simple structure .",
    "investigations of effects of such deviations are under way ."
