    "but for @xmath51 , the temperature power spectrum is essentially a factor of 50 whereas the e - type polarization power spectrum is a factor of @xmath380 larger than that expected from the scalar scdm model at @xmath359 .",
    "therefore , observational limits will be much stronger for causal fields than for scale - invariant fields .    to estimate the potential observational limits on stochastic magnetic fields , the induced microwave background anisotropies must be large enough to be disentangled from the anisotropies arising from density perturbations .",
    "current temperature maps give power spectrum measurements with error bars on the order of 10% out to @xmath381 for bins of width",
    "@xmath382 @xcite .",
    "the map satellite , which is already in orbit , will make temperature measurements out to around @xmath383 and will reach the cosmic variance limit , @xmath384 , out to @xmath381 @xcite . by the end of the decade , and perhaps within five years , we can expect a cosmic - variance limited temperature power spectrum measurement to @xmath385 .",
    "polarization fluctuations will also be detected soon , and the progress in their measurement will likely lag temperature fluctuations by about a decade . a rough but conservative estimate is that a magnetic - field signal which is at least 10% of the dominant density - perturbation signal will be detectable . the ultimate sensitivity in measuring the temperature power spectrum at , say , @xmath359 will be significantly better than this , and the extent to which magnetic fields can be constrained depends more on the degeneracy of the magnetic field signal with shifts in various cosmological parameters .",
    "basic statistical techniques for pursuing such an analysis are well - known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "using this crude 10% criterion , we can anticipate constraints on stochastic magnetic fields from upcoming temperature measurements ( e.g. , the map satellite , currently taking data ) by simply comparing the predicted amplitude at @xmath359 to the amplitude of current measurements , which is on the order of @xmath386 .",
    "we assume that the remainder of the power spectrum is used for discrimination between the signals from magnetic fields and other temperature power spectrum contributors . for the scale - invariant magnetic field with @xmath50 , a comoving mean - field amplitude of @xmath360 gives temperature anisotropies at the level of @xmath387 of current measurements . since for @xmath374 , @xmath388 , the constraint from temperature perturbations on a comoving @xmath0 scale will be around @xmath389 , which is approximately at the same level as the previous constraints for a primordial homogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the addition of e - type polarization measurements here will improve the constraint , since the ratio of the e - type polarization to temperature power spectra is larger for stochastic magnetic fields than the dominant density perturbations . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the polarization power spectra are comparable to the temperature power spectrum due to the dominant tensor perturbations ; thus e - type polarization measurements will yield more stringent constraints than temperature measurements alone . here",
    "we will be conservative and project stochastic magnetic field constraints using temperature measurements only . for @xmath16 , we have @xmath390 , where @xmath391(2n+3)$ ] , since @xmath392 , @xmath393 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : b - meansquare ] ) ] , and @xmath394 [ cf . eqs .",
    "( [ eq : v - damping ] ) and ( [ eq : t - damping ] ) ] .",
    "as @xmath17 increases towards causal values , the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations increases as @xmath116 and hence the constraints become stronger . at @xmath51 , @xmath395 at @xmath359 is approximately @xmath396 , which will yield a constraint on @xmath40 of @xmath397 . for the causal field @xmath366",
    ", the constraint on @xmath40 will be as small as @xmath2 .",
    "such constraints will be stronger than any current limits on mpc - scale primordial stochastic magnetic fields at decoupling .",
    "ultimately , b - type polarization has the greatest potential for constraining primordial magnetic fields .",
    "this is a cleaner signature , because primordial scalar ( density ) perturbations produce none @xcite . aside from polarized foreground emission ,",
    "the only other expected sources are from primordial tensor perturbations and from gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "tensor perturbations with a spectrum near scale - invariant will give significant anisotropies only at large angular scales ( @xmath398 ) , while lensing contributes mainly at small angular scales ( @xmath399 ) .",
    "stochastic magnetic fields will contribute on intermediate scales and should be clearly distinguishable .",
    "if foreground emission can be separated from its frequency dependence , limits on @xmath40 from b - type polarization should be determined purely by measurement error bars on @xmath400 .",
    "note that a primordial magnetic field also generates an additional b - type polarization signal via faraday rotation of the cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "this signal will be negligible compared to the direct b - type polarization signal for any frequency of practical interest .",
    "all of the results in this paper have been obtained via analytic approximations to the exact solutions .",
    "apart from the vector cross - correlation power spectrum , the accuracy of the results is as good as the quality of the analytic approximations to various expressions , except that the vector temperature case has neglected an additional few percent temperature contribution arising from the angular dependence of polarization and the vector potential .",
    "these approximations are all discussed in the text ; in sum , they are good to within 20% over the range of parameters considered , with the exception of the vector temperature case in the regime @xmath401 , which is good to within 30% .",
    "meanwhile , accuracy of the vector cross - correlation power spectrum is only good to within a factor of three , since we have neglected the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v - cross - power - spectrum ] ) arising from the correlation between the temperature dipole and the e - type polarization radial functions .",
    "it is important to realize that errors in these analytic approximations will have negligible effects on the estimation of the magnetic field limits for @xmath402 since the amplitude of each power spectrum scales as @xmath403 for @xmath374 and @xmath404 for @xmath16 .    in this paper , we have focussed on the magnetic field - induced microwave background anisotropies for @xmath19 , where the analysis is relatively simple and free from the detailed microphysics of recombination .",
    "we have only considered vector and tensor metric perturbations ; for smaller angular scales @xmath405 , the magnetic - induced cmb anisotropies are dominated by vector perturbations @xcite .",
    "stochastic magnetic fields will also produce scalar perturbations .",
    "this case is significantly more complex due to physical compensation effects and the large number of terms involved in the relevant expressions .",
    "rough analytic estimates show that including the scalar results will only modestly improve the magnetic field constraints given in this paper , since radiation pressure prevents the induced density fluctuations from growing effectively before recombination and the compressional modes are erased up to the silk scale @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "therefore scalar perturbations will generally give a subdominant contribution to the microwave background anisotropy .",
    "our results suggest that while it may be plausible for primordial stochastic fields with @xmath406 to result in the observed galactic fields via adiabatic compression alone , it will be very difficult for causal fields without invoking some form of dynamo mechanism . in a recent paper @xcite , a similar calculation using the nucleosynthesis bound on gravitational radiation induced by the anisotropic stress of a primordial stochastic magnetic field yields extremely stringent limits on the galactic - scale magnetic field amplitudes ( @xmath407 ) for fields generated at the electroweak phase transition or earlier , thus ruling out most of the magnetogenesis processes for primordial fields seeding the observed large - scale coherent galactic fields .",
