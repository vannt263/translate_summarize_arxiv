    "we derived the column density of the detected species in each clump from the integrated intensity of the observed emission lines , assuming lte condition and that the lines are optically thin . in this case",
    "the following formula can be used    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the rotational temperature , @xmath15 is the partition function , @xmath16 is the degeneracy of the upper level , @xmath17 is the frequency of the transition in ghz , @xmath18 is the einstein coefficient of the transition in s@xmath19 , @xmath20 is the energy of the upper level of the transition and the integral of the line emission is in k km  s@xmath19 .",
    "the integration limits and the polygon used to calculate the column densities are the same for all molecules in each clump . in table [ column ] we list the column densities of the observed molecules assuming the two extreme temperatures of 55 and 132 k. the two values can give an idea of the error associated to the column density produced by the uncertainty on the temperature of the gas .",
    "these values must be considered as lower limits because the lte assumption may be not valid for most of the transitions since they have a critical density @xmath2110@xmath10 @xmath7 . moreover",
    ", the total flux of the lines is underestimated due the filtering of the large scale emission ( see sect . [ filtering ] ) .",
    "considering the large uncertainty in the column densities derived with such a procedure , that can be as high as one order of magnitude , we can say that the values derived from the present 2 mm data are consistent with the ones previously derived from 3 mm data @xcite , the two differing no more than a factor of 10 .",
    "we also calculated the column density of the hv bullets by using eq .",
    "[ eqcd ] and assuming a temperature of 64 k. the results are presented in table [ column_bullets ] where also the values of cs and ch@xmath0oh column densities derived with other methods are reported ( see sect . 5.2 and 6 ) .",
    "for each of the observed species the column densities in the four hv bullets is similar .",
    "in addition there are also no big differences between the column densities of the bullets ( table [ column_bullets ] ) and the column densities of the emission at larger scale ( table [ column ] ) .",
    "we compared the observed column densities of the hv bullets with chemical models of c  type shock previously used in @xcite for modeling the h@xmath2o(1@xmath221@xmath4 ) and nh@xmath0 ( 1@xmath230@xmath23 ) lines in l1157b1 .",
    "the models were run with a code that couples the ucl_chem time ",
    "dependent gas ",
    "grain chemical code @xcite with the parametric shock model of @xcite which calculates the physical structure of a plane  parallel steady  state c  shock that propagates through an unperturbed medium .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the detailed description of the model and the choice of the investigated parameter space .",
    "we analyzed the same parameter space as in @xcite using all the models of their table 1 .",
    "in fig . [ chem_abundace ]",
    "we show the evolution of the chemical abundances with respect to h@xmath2 as function of distance within the shock . for a direct comparison of our data with the models we calculated the theoretical column density of the observed species summing the contribution of the gas along the length of the shock ( see fig .",
    "[ chem_cd ] ) . because of the inclination of the l1157 outflow , these calculated values correspond to the column densities along the line of sight only in case of a spherical symmetry of the shocked area .",
    "any deviation of the real shock geometry from the spherical symmetry introduces errors in the theoretical column density .",
    "however , the large uncertainties on the observed column densities , that can be as high as one order of magnitude , make useless a comparison with a more complex model of the geometry .    at the distance of l1157b1 ( 250 pc , @xcite ) the average dimension of the hv clump of 5 corresponds to a size of 2@xmath810@xmath24 cm while the total dimension of b1 in our maps is @xmath2520 , corresponding to about 8 @xmath810@xmath24 cm , and it should be considered a lower limit because of the filtering of the large scale emission in interferometer ( see sect .",
    "2.1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit for the size of b1 can be derived from iram-30 m single dish observations @xcite to be 30 , corresponding to about 10@xmath26 cm ; hence in fig .",
    "[ chem_cd ] we limited the x  axis to that size .",
    "we find that models with low preshock density ( 10@xmath27 @xmath7 ) have long saturation time resulting in shock length larger than 3@xmath810@xmath26 cm which corresponds to an angular size larger than the total dimension of the blue lobe of l1157 while models with preshock density larger than 10@xmath28 @xmath7 are compatible with the dimension of the b1 shock .",
    "in particular , for models with preshock density of 10@xmath10 @xmath7 the column densities integrated over a linear dimension of @xmath25 10@xmath26 cm include both the thin shock layer at high temperature and the post shocked region where the temperature drops .",
    "models show that ch@xmath0oh and h@xmath2co , species mainly formed on the grains , are sputtered back to the gas phase as soon as the shock temperature increases to a few tens of k. therefore the abundance of these species is not directly linked to the parameters of the shock but mainly depends on the percentage of gas depleted on to the dust grains during the cold pre - shock phase . in general , models with a low percentage of depletion ( @xmath2930% of gas phase",
    "co frozen onto grains at the end of the accretion phase ) produce column density of ch@xmath0oh and h@xmath2co a few orders of magnitude lower than observed ( see for example model 1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that h@xmath2co has a double peak behaviour ( see fig .",
    "[ chem_abundace ] ) , with the first peak occurring when the temperature starts to increases ; as the shock progresses formaldehyde starts declining ; it then increase again",
    "once the shock has passed through and the gas cools down .",
    "this behaviour is explained by the fact that the dominant route of destruction for this species is via a reaction with atomic hydrogen , whose abundance is directly proportional to the temperature .    also of particular interest",
    "is hc@xmath0n , a molecule that has never been analyzed before in the framework of shock models in protostellar outflows .",
    "in fact , hc@xmath0n has been observed and modeled in many pre  stellar core with fractional abundances from a few 10@xmath30 up to 6@xmath810@xmath31 in tmc-1 core d ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite showed that in pre ",
    "stellar cores hc@xmath0n is quickly destroyed once the main accretion phase is finished .",
    "@xcite observed hc@xmath0n ( 1211 ) along the wall of the cavity of the l1157 outflow close to the driving protostar and claimed that the enhancement of hc@xmath0n could be produced by the shock created by the precessing jet .",
    "indeed , in our shock models we find that this species is formed during the shock , and only models where the gas reaches high maximum temperatures ( @xmath32=4000 k ) can reproduce the observed hc@xmath0n column density : hc@xmath0n formation is enhanced at high temperatures mainly because of the reaction : c@xmath2h + hcn which forms hc@xmath0n .",
    "this reaction has a barrier of  770 k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , therefore , the higher the temperature the more efficient hc@xmath0n formation is . in order to reach the observed abundance , and considering the short - lived high temperature phase , models with a high t@xmath33 are favoured , in agreement with the conclusions drawn in @xcite for ammonia .",
    "it is possible of course that this species would be equally enhanced in models where a lower , but longer lived , temperature phase is maintained .    in conclusions , in agreement with @xcite , we find that the observed column densities in l1157b1 can be reproduced qualitatively by the presence of a c  type shock with a pre  shock density @xmath3410@xmath28 @xmath7 and velocity @xmath25 40 km  s@xmath19 so that the maximum shock temperature reaches the 4000 k.",
    "we present high spatial resolution maps of the b1 shock knot in the blue lobe of the l1157 outflow of the cs ( 32 ) , ch@xmath0oh ( 3@xmath12@xmath1 ) , hc@xmath0n ( 1615 ) and p - h@xmath2co ( 2@xmath33@xmath4 ) lines .",
    "the combined analysis of the morphology and spectral profiles has shown that the gas flowing at higher velocity is confined to a few compact ( @xmath5 5 ) bullets while the gas flowing at lower velocity trace the wall of the gas cavity excavated by the jet and the apex of the b1 bow shock . in particular , two hv bullets , one peaking at 16 km  s@xmath19 and one at 6 km  s@xmath19 , have been detected in the direction of the north - east b0e clump , one hv bullet at 12 km  s@xmath19 has been detected in the direction of b1a and one at 4 km  s@xmath19 in the direction of b1b .",
    "we applied a lvg model to the cs ( 32 ) and ( 21 ) lines whose ratio is a good tracer of the gas density . by using temperature estimate from the literature we were able to give an upper limit of 10@xmath6 @xmath7 to the b1 averaged gas density , therefore refining previous density estimates that give only a lower limit of 10@xmath10 @xmath7 .",
    "for the compact bullets we found that the gas density is in the range 5@xmath810@xmath9 5@xmath810@xmath10 @xmath7 therefore they seem to be less dense than the large scale emitting gas .",
    "we derived the column densities of the observed species both for the large scale as well as for the compact gas and we found similar values .",
    "in particular , the observed column densities in l1157b1 , derived from low / medium energy transitions ( @xmath35 60 k ) of the four molecules cs , ch@xmath0oh , hc@xmath0n and h@xmath2co , can be reproduced qualitatively by the presence in b1 of a c  type shock with a pre  shock density @xmath3410@xmath28 @xmath7 .",
    "the measured enhancement of the hc@xmath0n abundance requires a maximum shock temperature of at least 4000 k that can be reached for shock velocity of @xmath25 40 km  s@xmath19 .    of particular interest",
    "is the b0e region where we found a gradient of the first moment with increasing velocity moving from the internal wall of the cavity toward the outside in the direction of b0e ",
    "hv2 , the higher velocity bullet that is external with respect to the walls of the outflow cavity .",
    "the interpretation of this very intriguing feature is not univocal : it may be that the precessing jet , not yet observed directly in the l1157 outflow , is now impacting at the b0e position accelerating the gas outwards of the cavity , or , alternatively that the compact high velocity bullet is a clumpy structure formed , at least partially , before the advent of the outflow as suggested by the lower gas density in the hv bullets .",
