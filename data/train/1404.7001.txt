    "whether massive neutrinos are the majorana particles remains an open question in particle physics . by definition ,",

    "in the basis where flavor and mass eigenstates of the charged leptons coincide with each other , the @xmath0 decay rate is controlled by the @xmath12 element of the effective majorana neutrino mass matrix @xcite @xmath13 where the greek subscripts run over @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 denotes the @xmath18-th neutrino mass , and @xmath19 stands for the corresponding element of the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath20 @xcite . of course",

    "while the value of @xmath32 and the absolute value of @xmath33 are also measured , the sign of @xmath34 and the absolute neutrino mass scale remain unknown .",
    "hence the size of @xmath1 suffers from three kinds of uncertainties even without any new physics pollution :    * the unknown absolute neutrino mass scale ( i.e. , the value of @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) ; * the unknown neutrino mass ordering ( i.e. , either @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) ; * the unknown majorana cp - violating phases @xmath40 and @xmath41 appearing in @xmath2 .    up to now , a lot of phenomenological efforts have been made to probe the parameter space of @xmath1 and discuss its sensitivity to possible new physics @xcite .    in the present work we are going to put forward a novel  coupling - rod \" diagram to describe the salient features of @xmath42 in the complex plane , by which the effects of the neutrino mass ordering and cp - violating phases on @xmath42 can be intuitively understood",
    "some special but interesting cases , including the behavior of @xmath42 with @xmath43 or @xmath44 and the maximum or minimum of @xmath2 in two different neutrino mass spectra , are easily explained in this geometric language .",
