    "the azimuthal correlation of charged hadrons with respect to a direct - photon ( @xmath0 ) trigger was proposed as a promising probe to study the mechanisms of parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "since a @xmath0-trigger escapes without interacting with the medium , it approximates the initial energy of the recoil parton , which is subject to medium modifications .",
    "the recoil parton of a @xmath0 trigger is a quark in leading - order qcd processes , whereas that of a high-@xmath3  @xmath1 trigger can be a quark or a gluon .",
    "in addition , a coincidence measurement of @xmath1 is biased to have been produced near the surface of the medium , while that of a @xmath0 does not suffer from the same bias  @xcite .",
    "hence the comparison between the suppression of per - trigger away - side associated yields of @xmath0 to those of @xmath1 triggers should exhibit differences due to both the color - factor dependence and the path - length dependence of energy loss .",
