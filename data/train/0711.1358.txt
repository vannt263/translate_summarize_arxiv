    "pioneering hst imaging studies of the centers of early - type galaxies suggested an apparently abrupt transition in central stellar density at @xmath15 mag  the so - called  core / power - law dichotomy \" ( e.g. , ferrarese 1994 ; lauer 1995 ) .",
    "these findings prompted the widely held view that the bright (  core \" ) and faint (  power - law \" ) galaxies follow distinct evolutionary routes ( e.g. , faber 1997 ) .",
    "however , the evidence for such a dichotomy has lessened ( although not entirely disappeared ) following more recent studies that identified a population of galaxies with intermediate properties ( rest 2001 ; ravindranath 2001 ) .",
    "the slope , @xmath5 , of the central surface brightness profile  usually parameterized as a  nuker \" law ( essentially two power - laws that merge at a characteristic  break \" radius ; lauer 1995 ) and measured at the angular distance corresponding to the instrumental resolution  has traditionally been taken as a diagnostic of this behavior .    however , using acs profiles for 100 early - type galaxies belonging to the virgo cluster , ferrarese ( 2006a ) showed that srsic models provide more accurate parameterizations of the global brightness profiles than do nuker models ( see also graham 2004 ; ferrarese 2006c ) and argued that the core / power - law dichotomy is an artifact introduced in part by the use of an inappropriate ( i.e. , power - law ) parameterization of the outer profiles , combined with a tendency in previous work ( which usually relied on hst brightness profiles of limited radial extent ) to not properly account for the compact stellar nuclei found in low- and intermediate luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , graham & guzmn 2003 ; grant 2005 ; ct 2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the best available imaging dataset  in terms of depth , radial coverage , angular resolution , completeness and homogeneity  to re - examine the central structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "our analysis relies on hst / acs imaging for 100 early - type members of the virgo ( previously discussed in ferrarese 2006ab and ct 2006 ) and new hst / acs imaging for 43 early - type members of the fornax cluster ( jordn 2007 ) .",
    "our principle finding is clear evidence for a continuous , systematic progression from central luminosity deficit ( @xmath2 ) to excess ( @xmath14 ) within a characteristic radius , approximately equal to 2% of the galaxy effective radius .",
    "we find no evidence for a  core / power - law \" dichotomy .",
    "_ hst _ images for 143 members of the virgo and fornax clusters were acquired with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , ford  1998 ) as part of the acs virgo ( acsvcs ; go-9401 ) and fornax ( acsfcs ; go-10217 ) cluster surveys ( ct 2004 ; jordn 2007 ) .",
    "surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements ( mei 2005 , 2007 ; blakeslee 2008 , in preparation ) reveal the program galaxies to span luminosity ranges of @xmath13 545 ( virgo ) , @xmath13 345 ( fornax ) and @xmath13 720 ( combined ) .",
    "all galaxies have early - type morphologies ( i.e. , e , s0 , de , de , n or ds0 ) and are confirmed velocity members of their respective clusters .",
    "images were taken in the wide field channel ( wfc ) mode with a filter combination ( f475w and f850lp ) roughly equivalent to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric system .",
    "the images cover a roughly 200@xmath18 field with 005 pixel@xmath19 sampling and @xmath20 resolution .",
    "this resolution limit translates to physical scales of 8.0 and 9.5  pc for virgo and fornax , respectively . for the 21 virgo galaxies brighter than @xmath21 ,",
    "the profiles were extended in radius by matching the acs profiles to those measured from sdss @xmath16 and @xmath17 mosaics ( data release 5 ; adelman - mccarthy 2007 ) generated using the procedures described in west ( 2007 ) .",
    "the acsvcs sample is complete for early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and 44% complete down to its limiting magnitude of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the acsfcs sample , meanwhile , is complete down to its limiting magnitude of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) with the exception of a single galaxy ( fcc161 = ngc1379 ) for which the data acquisition failed because of a shutter problem .",
    "full details on the construction of the azimuthally averaged brightness profiles and the adopted fitting procedures ( e.g. , correction for dust obscuration , masking of background sources , the identification of offset nuclei via centroid shifts , and the choice of weighting schemes and minimization routines , etc ) are given in ",
    " 3.1 , 3.2 and 3.3 of ferrarese ( 2006a ) and   3.1 , 3.2 , 4.1 and 4.2 of ct  ( 2006 ) .",
    "figures  1 and 2 shows @xmath16 and @xmath17 surface brightness profiles for nine representative galaxies belonging to each of the acsvcs and acsfcs samples . to parameterize",
    "the brightness profiles , we begin by noting that srsic ( 1968 ) models @xmath28 \\right\\},\\ ] ] generally provide accurate descriptions of the global profiles of the program galaxies  most importantly the downward curvature on large scales  with only three free parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath1 ) . however , the _ central _ regions of the profiles ( typically @xmath31 pc for the brightest galaxies , and @xmath32 pc for the faintest ) , deviate significantly from the inward extrapolations of the srsic profiles for both galaxies brighter than @xmath2 ( which show central light _ deficits _ ) and for most galaxies fainter than @xmath33 ( which usually show central _ excesses _ ) .",
    "by contrast , most galaxies with @xmath4 are reasonably well fitted by a single srsic model over all radii , as previously noted by graham & guzmn ( 2003 ) .",
    "the discovery of a systematic progression from central light deficit to excess along the luminosity function was discussed extensively in ct ( 2006 ) and ferrarese  ( 2006ab ) .",
    "this transition from deficit to excess at @xmath34 corresponds to srsic indices of @xmath35 , based on the scaling relations presented in  4.3 of ferrarese  ( 2006a ; see their eq .",
    "27 ) .    to put this trend on a more quantitative footing",
    ", we parameterize the observed brightness profiles of the acsvcs and acsfcs galaxies in two different ways .",
    "first , given that the departures from srsic models always occur on scales of a few arcseconds and usually much less  meaning that the innermost behavior is dominated by the instrumental point spread function ( psf )  a simple , psf - convolved , power - law profile ( with @xmath36 ) inside a break radius , @xmath37 , usually provides an adequate representation of the observed profiles .",
    "the short dashed curves in each panel of figures  1 and 2 shows such  core - srsic \" models ( graham 2003 ) , @xmath38^{\\gamma / \\alpha } \\exp \\biggl [ -b_n   \\biggl ( { r^{\\alpha } + r_b^{\\alpha } \\over r_e^{\\alpha } } \\biggr ) ^{1/(\\alpha n ) } \\biggr ] , \\ ] ] fitted to the profiles in both bandpasses after convolution with the instrumental psfs .",
    "note that @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is related to the intensity , @xmath40 , at the break radius @xmath37 through the relation : @xmath41.\\ ] ] thus , this choice of parameterization requires a total of five free parameters ( @xmath40 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath30 and @xmath1 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the dotted curves in each panel of figures  1 and 2 show the inward extrapolations of an outer srsic component , illustrating the systematic evolution from deficit to excess .",
    "the arrows show the fitted values of @xmath37 for each galaxy .",
    "as pointed out above , the profiles in the innermost regions are dominated by the instrumental psf , so a different parameterization of the inner component could provide equally acceptable fits , particuarly for the low- and intermediate - luminosity galaxies .",
    "indeed , a detailed study of the nuclear brightness profiles of nearby galaxies ( ferrarese 2008 , in preparation ) suggests that an excellent parameterization over all scales is given by a double srsic model , @xmath44 \\right\\ } + i_{e,2 } \\exp \\left\\ { -b_{n,2 } \\biggl [ \\biggl ( { r \\over r_{e,2 } } \\biggl)^{1/n_2 } - 1 \\biggr ] \\right\\ } \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] in which one component corresponds to the galaxy profile and the other to the central light excess ( i.e. , a compact spheroidal or flattened stellar component ) . in this case , a total of six parameters are needed to describe the entire brightness profile ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus , for our second (  composite \" ) description of the ensemble profiles we adopt , on an object - by - object basis , one of three parameterizations that best fits the observed profile : ( 1 ) a core - srsic model ( eq .",
    "2 ) ; ( 2 ) a single , unbroken srsic model ( eq .",
    "1 ) ; or ( 3 ) a double srsic model ( eq .  4 ) . as mentioned above , the precise choice of parameterization is found to depend strongly on galaxy luminosity : all galaxies brighter than @xmath2 are modeled with core - srsic laws , while most galaxies slightly fainter than this ( @xmath4 ) are well fitted with a single srsic model over all radii . for the majority of galaxies fainter than @xmath33",
    ", a double srsic model can accurately match the profiles on all scales .",
    "a small number of galaxies ( @xmath51 10% of the sample ) fainter than @xmath52 are found _ not _ to require a second srsic component ( i.e. , they contain no obvious central nucleus and their profiles are generally well fitted by a single srsic model ) .",
    "we shall return to these interesting objects in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the long dashed curves in figures  1 and 2 show these  composite models \" , with the exact choice of parametrization listed in the lower left corner of each panel .",
    "the short and long dashed curves are generally indistinguishable , confirming that , for these particular galaxies , either approach yields an acceptable parameterization of the profiles on both large and small scales . our conclusions are therefore robust to the choice of these two parameterizations .",
    "while it is well established that the brightest early - type galaxies differ from their fainter counterparts in terms of isophotal shape , ellipticity , kinematics and stellar populations ( see , e.g. , bender 1989 ; kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ; caon 1993 ; ferrarese 2006a ; emsellem 2007 ) the strongest evidence for a bonafide _ dichotomy _ in their structural properties  rather than a continous variation along the luminosity function with some intrinsic scatter  has come from the behavior of their central brightness profile slopes ( ferrarese 1994 ; lauer 1995 ; rest 2001 ; ravindranath 2001 ; lauer 2007 ) .",
    "however , ferrarese ( 2006ac ) noted that such slope measurements have often relied on heterogeneous archival hst images ( i.e. , different instruments , filters , and resolution limits ) or on galaxy samples with ill - defined selection functions and spanning wide ranges in distance ( e.g. , from 3.5  mpc to @xmath53 320  mpc in the case of the recent study by lauer 2007 ) .",
    "if such a dichotomy has a physical origin , then it would seem more appropriate to measure the slope at either the same physical  rather than angular  radius , as was done in ferrarese ( 2006a ) , or at a point corresponding to a constant fraction of some characteristic scale radius in every galaxy ( see also ferrarese 2006c ) .",
    "( a - d ) _ of figure  3 illustrate this point by plotting the slope of the best - fit composite model at differing fractions of the effective radius of the galaxy ( 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.05 and 0.30 ) as a function of absolute blue magnitude .",

    "[ sec : param ] .",
    "note that this approach differs from the one adopted by ferrarese ( 2006a ) who  recognizing that compact stellar mass concentrations become increasingly prominent among progressively fainter and lower surface brightness galaxies  preferred to measure the slope of the underlying _ galaxy component _ rather than using the combined ( i.e. , galaxy + nucleus ) profiles .",
    "the photometric and structural scaling relations derived by ferrarese ( 2006a ) corroborated previous reports of a continuum in galaxy properties fainter than @xmath55 ( e.g. , see  4 and 5 of ferrarese 2006a and references therein ) , with no dichotomy between giants and dwarfs ( see also the discussion in  1 of graham & guzman 2003 ) .",

    "four important points are illustrated in these panels .",
    "first , the overall trends defined by the virgo and fornax galaxies are indistinguishable .",
    "second , the behavior of the @xmath5-@xmath56 relation for two reasons .",
    "first , the scaling relations and dichotomies discussed in this paper have traditionally been expressed in this bandpass .",
    "second , placing the acsvcs and acsfcs galaxies in the broader context of their cluster environments ( i.e. , see  [ sec : lauer ] ) is most straighforward using this bandpass since the wide - field , photographic ( blue emulsion ) surveys of binggeli , sandage & tammann ( 1985 ) and ferguson ( 1989 ) remain the most homogeneous photometric catalogs for virgo and fornax cluster galaxies .",
    "homogeneous ` curve - of - growth ' photometry from wide - field _ ugrizjhk _ imaging for the acsvcs galaxies will be presented in chen ( 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "] is obviously sensitive to the exact choice of measurement radius , particularly on the smallest angular scales .",
    "third , the @xmath5-@xmath56 relation undergoes an unmistakable  inversion \" between @xmath57-@xmath58 : on the smallest scales , the profiles are found to _",
    "steepen systematically _ as one moves down the luminosity function , whereas on larger scales , the profiles become _ progressively shallower _ with decreasing luminosity . and",
    ", finally , in no case is there clear evidence for a dichotomy or bimodality ( see also figures  1 and 2 ) .      the continuity of the @xmath5-@xmath56 relations shown in the first four panels of figure  [ fig : delta ] , while consistent with the finding of no core / power - law dichotomy by ferrarese ( 2006a ) , is apparently at odds with a recent detection of strong bimodality in @xmath5 by lauer ( 2007 ) .",
    "however , it is clear from this figure that the distribution of slopes found for any sample of galaxies will depend sensitively on both the choice of measurement radii and the luminosity distribution of the galaxies themselves .    in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : bimodal ]",
    ", we plot as the open blue histogram the luminosity function , @xmath59 , of the 143 galaxies that make up the acs virgo and fornax cluster surveys .",
    "the single- and double - hatched histograms show the results for the acsvcs and acsfcs samples , respectively .",
    "the dashed red curve shows a schechter function with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , the best - fit parameters for early - type ( e+s0+de+ds0 ) galaxies in the virgo cluster according to sandage , binggeli & tammann ( 1985 ) .",
    "the normalization of the schechter function has been chosen to match the luminosity function of the acsvcs and acsfcs sample galaxies brighter than @xmath63 .",
    "recall that both surveys are complete above this level and that the acsfcs sample is complete for @xmath64 .",
    "the blue histogram in _ panel ( b ) _ shows the luminosity distribution of the 219 galaxies analysed by lauer ( 2007 ) .",
    "magnitudes given in lauer ( 2007 ) to @xmath56 by assuming @xmath65 for bcg / e galaxies and @xmath66 for s0 galaxies ( fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "a color of @xmath66 was also adopted for the lone sa galaxy in their sample . ] the schechter function from _ panel ( a ) _ is reproduced as the dashed red curve .",
    "the common element in the selection of these galaxies was the availability in the literature of nuker model fits to brightness profiles derived from either wfpc1 , wfpc2 , nic2 or nic3 imaging .",
    "two important properties of the lauer ( 2007 ) sample are worth noting .",
    "first , it is unrepresentative of the schechter function form that provides a reasonable match to the luminosity distribution of the early - type galaxy populations in virgo and fornax in particular ( sandage 1985 ; ferguson & sandage 1988 ) and , more generally , those of galaxies in both cluster or field enviroments ( e.g. , schechter 1976 ; loveday 1992 ; marzke 1994 ; blanton 2003 ) .",
    "second , as lauer ( 2007 ) point out , their sample is bimodal in luminosity  a result that we confirm . a kmm analysis ( mclachlan & basford 1988 ; ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) indicates a 0.3% chance that these data are drawn randomly from a unimodal gaussian distribution ( the null hypothesis ) .",
    "assuming homoscedasticity and clipping seven galaxies with @xmath67 ( which serve to make the distribution even more bimodal ) , we find peaks at @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "what then is the expected distribution of @xmath5 values for this dataset ? as _ panels ( a - d ) _ of figure  [ fig : delta ] demonstrate , the detailed form of the @xmath5 distribution will depend not only on the program galaxy magnitudes , but also on the choice of radius , @xmath70 , at which @xmath5 is measured .",
    "lauer ( 2007 ) choose to measure @xmath43 at the data resolution limit ( 002 , 004 or 01 depending on the instrument ) for all galaxies in their sample , regardless of their distance or effective radius .",
    "according to the data in their tables  1 and 2 , @xmath70 thus varies between 0.00017 and 0.030 ( a factor of 178 ) for the 150 galaxies in their sample for which estimates of @xmath1 are available in their table  1 .",
    "to illustrate the behavior of the @xmath5 distribution expected for their sample , we combine their @xmath56 values , calculated as described above , with the @xmath5-@xmath56 relation shown as the smooth polynomial in _ panel ( a ) _ of figure  [ fig : delta ] : i.e. , for @xmath71 , which falls within the range of @xmath70 values used by lauer ( 2007 ) . to approximate intrinsic scatter and measurement uncertainties , we assume a fixed dispersion of @xmath72(@xmath5 ) = 0.1 for @xmath73 , and rising linearly with galaxy magnitude to @xmath72(@xmath5 ) = 0.5 at @xmath74 .    the @xmath5 distribution found in a typical simulation",
    "is shown by the heavy magenta histogram in _ panel ( c)_. in this case , kmm identifies highly significant peaks at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with a less than 0.1% chance of drawing these data from a unimodal gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , the simulated distribution is found to be strongly bimodal _ despite the fact that the input @xmath5-@xmath56 varies smoothly along the luminosity function_. the peak values of the simulated distribution should be compared to the values of 0.11 and 0.70 that we find when applying kmm to the actual @xmath5 measurements tabulated in table  2 of lauer ( 2007 ) , reproduced here as the thin blue histogram .",
    "although the two distributions differ in the details ( which is not surprising since , as mentioned above , lauer do not measure @xmath5 at a fixed fraction of @xmath1 or any other fixed physical scale ) , our exercise suggests that the bimodality in @xmath5 reported by lauer ( 2007 ) is likely an artifact of a sample defined by a bimodal luminosity distribution that is : ( 1 ) unrepresentative of real galaxy ensembles ; and ( 2 ) strongly biased in favor of bright , but intrinsically rare , galaxies that are known to have nearly constant - density cores .",
    "for instance , 56 of the galaxies in the lauer et al .",
    "compilation ( 26% of their sample ) are brighter than vcc1226 ( m49 = ngc4472 ) , the brightest member of the virgo cluster .",
    "to first order , srsic models provide accurate representations of the global , azimuthally averaged brightness profiles for almost all galaxies in our sample , largely independent of luminosity , morphological type , prior classification as giant or dwarf , and the presence or absence of morphological pecularities such as rings , shells and bars .",
    "however , the central deviations provide a notable exception to this rule .",
    "it is striking that , in all galaxies , the inner departure from the srsic model occurs at very nearly the same fraction of the effective radius . using the core - srsic parameterization ( which can be applied uniformly to all galaxies )",
    "we find the median logarithmic ratio of the break radius to the effective radius to be @xmath77 with @xmath78 scatter 0.33 .",
    "thus , the inner deviations from the srsic law are found to occur at a characteristic radius of @xmath79 , with some scatter ( the @xmath80 1@xmath72 range is 0.0100.045 ) that does not appear to correlate with any galaxy property . as an illustration ,",
    "the vertical dashed lines in each panel of figures  1 and 2 are drawn at 0.02@xmath1 , where @xmath1 is measured independently in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 profiles .",
    "because the departures from the inward extrapolation of the outer srsic component occur at @xmath81 , we define a parameter , @xmath12 , as the logarithm of the ratio of the total luminosity of the best - fit galaxy model ( core - srsic or composite ) , @xmath7 , inside this radius to that of the outer srsic component in this same region : @xmath82 .",
    "note that this description of the central behavior of the brightness profiles has the advantage relative to @xmath5 that it is an _ integral _ measurement , rather than a differential one , and is thus less susceptible to noise in the profiles , psf uncertainties , and the extent to which the stellar nucleus may be resolved .",
    "galaxies with central light deficits then have @xmath83 , those with excesses have @xmath84 , and those whose profiles are well represented by srsic models over the full range in radius have @xmath85 .",
    "( e ) _ of figure  3 shows the dependence of @xmath12 on absolute blue magnitude for the sample galaxies .",
    "the overall trends exhibited by the virgo and fornax galaxies are the same : a gradual transition from light deficits ( @xmath86 ) for galaxies brighter than @xmath55 to light excesses ( @xmath87 ) for the faintest program galaxies .",
    "this description of the inner galaxy also allows a straightforward definition of nucleated vs. non - nucleated galaxies .",
    "for instance , adopting @xmath84 as the definition of a central stellar nucleus , one finds 69% of the combined sample galaxies , and 82% of all galaxies fainter than @xmath63 , to be nucleated .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the values for acsvcs galaxies reported in ct ( 2006 ) .",
    "we point out that the tendency for early - type galaxies of low- and intermediate luminosity to have central brightness profiles that fall above srsic laws is not a new result : several previous investigators had noted that such behavior in isolated galaxies or using small datasets ( e.g. , binggeli & jerjen 1998 ; kormendy 1999 ; stiavelli 2001 ; graham & guzmn 2003 ) .",
    "however , the systematic variation along the luminosity function from central light deficit to light excess  with no apparent structural dichotomies between  core \" and  power - law \" galaxies at @xmath55 , nor between giants and dwarfs at @xmath88 ( c.f .",
    "kormendy 1985 )  has only been possible thanks to the uniformity , homogeneity and luminosity coverage of the acsvcs and acsfcs datasets .",
    "the central deficits in bright ellipticals have been traditionally interpreted as evidence for core evacuation by coalescing supermassive black hole ( sbh ) binaries ( ebisuzaki 1991 ; faber 1997 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ) , although at least one recent study suggests that the dissipationless collapse of initially cold stellar distributions in existing dark matter haloes can also give rise to such features ( nipoti et al .",
    "the discovery of a systematic transition from central deficit to excess should provide an important new clue to the formation of both high- and low - luminosity early - type galaxies and the connection to sbhs .",
    "it is worth noting that the mass fraction contributed by the central nuclei in low- and intermediate - luminosity galaxies is indistinguishable ( @xmath89% ) from that of sbhs in bright galaxies , suggestive of a shared formation path ( ct 2006 , ferrarese 2006ab ; wehner & harris 2006 ; rossa 2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , mclaughlin & king ( 2006 ) point out that feedback by stellar winds and supernovae may also be capable of reproducing the observed scaling relations without a direct connection between the nuclei and sbhs . and , as ferrarese ( 2006b ) note , there are at least some galaxies ( such as m32 ) that contain both a central excess ( worthey 2004 ) and a sbh ( verolme 2002 )",
    ".    a lengthy discussion of the selection effects that prevented the ubiquitous nature of these nuclei from being fully appreciated with ground - based imaging was presented in ct ( 2006 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the foremost advangtage of hst / acs in this regard is its exceptional angular resolution .",
    "one might think , then , that the detection of nuclei in low- and intermediate - luminosity would have been straightforward in early high - resolution hst imaging , but this often proved not to be the case .",
    "for instance , the left panel of figure  [ fig : v1440 ] compares our acs profile for vcc1440  a low - luminosity elliptical previously classified as a  power - law \" galaxy  to the wfpc1 profile of lauer ( 1995 , 2007 ) . for this galaxy .",
    "we measure @xmath90 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "these radii are indicated by the tickmarks in figure  [ fig : v1440 ] . ] in this case , the limited radial extent of the wfpc1 profile , and the adopted parameterization of the galaxy profile as a power - law , allowed the full extent of the central excess to go unrecognized , although its signature is evident in the s - shaped residuals of the fitted nuker model ( see also ferrarese 2006c ) .    in hindsight , the realization that compact stellar mass concentrations reside at the centers of most low- and intermediate galaxies should perhaps have come as no surprise .",
    "many theoretical studies have shown that such mass concentrations may be a generic outcome of the galaxy formation process .",
    "proposed formation routes include repeated mergers of star clusters drawn to the galaxy center via dynamical friction , the growth of @xmath94 density cusps due to two - body relaxation of stars orbiting a central sbh ( bahcall & wolf 1976 ) and/or central star formation driven by gas inflows  likely modulated by stellar evolution , mergers , igm confinement , and feedback from stellar winds , supernovae or pre - existing agn ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; mclaughlin 2006 ; li 2007 ; hopkins 2007 ) .",
    "a comparison of the properties ( e.g. , sizes , luminosity functions , mass fractions , colors ) of nuclei and star clusters in acsvcs program galaxies argues against the first scenario as the _ dominant _ formation mechanism ( e.g. , see  5.2 of ct 2006 ) .",
    "likewise , bahcall - wolf  cusps \" generated by sbhs do not seem viable since most of the nuclei are _ resolved _ and thus much more extended than the predicted cusps ( e.g. , merritt & szell 2006 ) . on the other hand , gas inflow models",
    " either internally or externally modulated  seem more attractive as they have long predicted the formation of  dense stellar cores \" in early - type galaxies .",
    "consider the center and right panels of figure  [ fig : v1440 ] which compare the brightness profile of vcc1440 ( the same galaxy shown in the left panel ) to the simulations of mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) .",
    "these authors showed that compact central starbursts are found in the remnants of disk / halo mergers and went on to argue that this central component would lead to  a break in the mass profile at small radii ( @xmath95 ) \" .",
    "as figure  [ fig : v1440 ] and the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : radii ] show , this may turn out to be a remarkably prescient prediction .",
    "the fact that the deviations from the fitted srsic models occur on roughly the same ( @xmath95 ) scale for both the central excesses _ and _ central deficits ( which are usually attributed to binary sbh evolution ; see above ) presents something of a puzzle since it is unclear why these two unrelated physical mechanisms would give rise to deviations on the same ( fractional ) scale .    in any case , it will be important to test the gas inflow scenario envisaged by mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) by measuring star formation and chemical enrichment histories for the central regions of bright ( deficit ) and faint ( excess ) galaxies alike . both the measured color profiles ( ferrarese 2006a ) and the model - dependent integrated colors ( ct 2006 ) of the nuclei and galaxies in the acsvcs suggests that stellar population differences between the two components may indeed exist , with the nuclei in the faintest systems generally being bluer than the underlying galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , at least some intermediate - luminosity galaxies show evidence for surprisingly red central components ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) .    finally , we point out that the open symbols in _ panel ( e ) _ of figure  [ fig : delta ] denote galaxies with  de / dirr transition \" morphologies :",
    "i.e. , dust , young stellar clusters and/or evidence of young stellar populations from blue integrated colors ( ferrarese 2006a ; ct 2006 ) .",
    "such galaxies typically lack conspicuous central nuclei at their photocenters .",
    "the absence of a central excess may suggest that the process of nucleus - building  perhaps through delayed gas inflows and subsequent star formation  has yet to occur in these apparently young galaxies .",

    "<S> deficits _ with respect to the inward extrapolation of the srsic model , while the great majority of low- and intermediate - luminosity galaxies ( @xmath3 ) show central light _ excesses _ ; galaxies of intermediate luminosities ( @xmath4 ) are generally well fitted by srsic models over all radii . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the slope , @xmath5 , of the central surface brightness profiles , when measured at fixed fractions of @xmath1 , varies smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity in a manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for a core / power - law dichotomy , and show that a recent claim of strong bimodality in @xmath5 is likely an artifact of the biased galaxy selection function used in that study . to provide a more robust characterization of the inner regions of galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a parameter , @xmath6  where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the integrated luminosities inside @xmath9 of the observed profile and of the inward extrapolation of the outer srsic model  to describe the central luminosity deficit ( @xmath10 ) or excess ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath12 varies smoothly over the range of @xmath13 720  in luminosity spanned by the sample galaxies , with again no evidence for a dichotomy . </S>",
