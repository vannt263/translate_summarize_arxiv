    "the presence of a magnetic field in plasmas is known to introduce a strong anisotropy in the system .",
    "this is is commonly met in fusion and most astrophysical plasmas .",
    "developing numerical codes that take into account the strong plasma anisotropy and make efficient use of computational resources is crucial , for instance , to simulate iter - like tokamak plasmas .",
    "efforts have been made in this direction that lead to introducing optimized coordinate systems , so - called field - aligned coordinates , that take advantage of this anisotropy .",
    "two - dimensional field - aligned coordinates , based on magnetic flux variables , were first presented in  @xcite .",
    "they have a fundamental drawback of not handling situations including the magnetic separatrix , due to the singularity of the field - aligned metric .",
    "the approach proposed later in  @xcite avoids this shortcoming , but still relies on flux coordinates , for instance ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "a generalized 3-dimensional coordinate system , referred to as the flux coordinate independent ( fci ) system , not based on magnetic flux coordinates , is introduced in  @xcite and elaborated in  @xcite .",
    "the fci coordinate system is constructed in a way that avoids the use of flux variables to discretize the fields in the poloidal plane . as discussed in  @xcite",
    ", it allows the parallel derivative to be constructed by tracing the magnetic field lines from one perpendicular plane to the next , and interpolating to find the desired quantity .",
    "this frees us from using flux coordinates in the perpendicular plane , thus allowing for complex magnetic geometries free of singularities .",
    "the aim of the present work is to highlight the advantage underlying the use of the fci field - aligned system for x - point magnetic configurations .",
    "examples of such configurations are magnetic islands ( driven by magnetohydrodynamics modes or embedded in the magnetic equilibrium such as in stellerators ) and axi - symmetric x - points on the last closed field surface ( lcfs ) of tokamak plasmas .",
    "+ these configurations , found in fusion as well as astrophysical plasmas , have a singularity in the metric of a coordinate system that uses the magnetic flux as a coordinate .",
    "this difficulty originates in the nature of the flux function , which has a saddle point ( known as x - point ) in one or more locations . using the flux",
    "coordinate independent ( fci ) approach avoids this problem and opens the way for the numerical simulations of plasma turbulence in a tokamak geometry encompassing both closed and open magnetic field line regions .",
    "firstly , this is a necessary feature of codes addressing the question of the transition from the low ( l ) to the high ( h ) confinement regime in x - point geometry .",
    "it is worth reminding that iter would operate in the h confinement mode to achieve the expected thermonuclear fusion power .",
    "understandably , research in this direction is a hot topic and understanding turbulence in x - point geometries is crucial for predicting the l - h power threshold .",
    "secondly , studies of the interaction between micro - turbulence and magnetic islands exhibit a significant interplay affecting their dynamics .",
    "the most recent investigations on this topic are reported in  @xcite .",
    "+ the ultimate result of this paper is showing that the fci approach allows , in particular , not only a more natural treatment of the operations in the poloidal plane , but it also easily deals with x - point configurations and with o - points such as the magnetic axis , since it is constructed on coordinate systems with non - singular metric .",
    "for this purpose , we use the fenicia code presented in  @xcite , where the * f*lux indep*en*dent f*i*eld - aligned * c*oord*i*nate * a*pproach has been implemented .",
    "fenicia is based on a modular numerical scheme specially designed to address the anisotropic transport of any set of equations belonging to the general class of models @xmath1 in  @xcite . since",
    "this code is easily extensible to different meshes and coordinate systems , we use it here to demonstrate the application of the fci coordinate system to a magnetic island in a slab version of the code .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first of all , analytic solutions of a sound - wave propagation model for an island magnetic equilibrium are presented in section  [ sec : interior_exterior_solutions ] . then numerical tests are performed at the exterior and at the interior of the island to show the convergence of the numerical solution to the analytic one in section  [ sec : numerical_tests ] . across the separatrix , where there are not yet known analytic solutions , two conclusive numerical convergence tests are presented in section  [ sec : tests_separatrix ] allowing us to show the robustness of the fci approach in x - point and o - point magnetic configurations",

    "the two - dimensional vector @xmath9 indicates the position in this plane .",
    "the poloidal field can be written in terms of a flux function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 magnetic surfaces can be labeled by the value of @xmath12 . both closed and open field lines can be treated . as extensively discussed in  @xcite , slowly growing _ tearing _ instabilities reconnect magnetic flux surfaces to form magnetic islands .",

    "it is thus a quantitative mean that allows us to conclude that the numerical solution converges as the resolution in the @xmath63 direction decreases .",
    "in fact , at @xmath144 , the norm is approximately @xmath146 which is consistent with the fact that we used second order centered finite differences to compute the parallel gradient operator @xmath147 . with this result",

    "to finish , we do a last test showing the order of convergence of the numerical solution .",
    "in fact , for the same set of simulations , i.e : @xmath136 and @xmath137 , the test consists of choosing a reference case supposed to be the closest possible case to the analytic solution of the sound - wave problem . with this hypothesis ,",
    "it is legitimate to calculate the average of the difference between all the simulations and the reference simulation chosen to be that with @xmath148 ( root mean squared of the difference ) .",
    "the resulting graph  [ average_reference_nz100 ] shows that as @xmath115 tends to @xmath149 , the error tends to @xmath150 with an estimation of the order of convergence given by the loglog plot in fig .",

    "is shown to have a number of advantages over earlier approaches .",

    "then , a test case is considered with an initial perturbation that straddles the magnetic separatrix including the x - point . since there is no analytic solution in this case ,",
    "conservation properties were first verified , then three conclusive tests are performed to show the convergence of the numerical solution with respect to the number of points in the @xmath63 direction ( direction of symmetry ) allowing one to consider a much thinner grid to study the same physics . in the latter test",

    "very demanding situation , results show the robustness of the fci approach .",
    "we finally conclude this paper by the following : the fci approach allows not only for a coarser grid by exploiting the anisotropy of the system , but it also allows for flux - coordinate independent operations in the poloidal plane which opens the way to the implementation of complex magnetic geometries free of singularities .",
    "it deals without difficulty with x - point configurations and with o - points such as the magnetic axis .",
    "the flexible nature of fenicia presented in  @xcite allowed us to demonstrate the application of this coordinate system to a magnetic island in a slab , thus the validity of its application to x - point configurations .",
