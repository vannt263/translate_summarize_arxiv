    "the vela pulsar has a long history of @xmath0-ray observations dating back to the point source discovery and pulsed detection with sas-2 ( thompson et al.1974 and thompson et al.1975 , respectively ) .",
    "phase - resolved spectral results followed using data from cos - b @xcite and egret ( kanbach et al.1994 and fierro et al.1998 ) suggesting significant variation of the spectrum across the pulse , with the hardest emission observed between the two main @xmath0-ray peaks .    with the advent of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ fermi _ ) , it is now possible to study the @xmath0-ray emission from the vela pulsar in unprecedented detail .",
    "the main instrument aboard _ fermi _ is the large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite . using early calibration data @xcite and @xmath12 months of survey data the lat produced the highest resolution high - energy ( he , @xmath2 gev ) light curve of the vela pulsar to date , identified a third peak which moves with increasing energy , and ruled out low - altitude magnetospheric emission models @xcite . with 11 months of survey data",
    "it is now possible to perform the finest phase - resolved study of the vela pulsar to date by fitting the spectrum in 101 variable - width bins across the pulse .",
    "lat data was used to construct a timing solution for the vela pulsar with 63 @xmath3s residuals using techniques described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray timing solution was phase aligned with data from the parkes radio telescope @xcite .",
    "lat event data from 4 august 2008 to 4 july 2009 with reconstructed energies from 0.02 to 100 gev and belonging to the  diffuse \" class @xcite , as defined under the p6_v3 instrument response functions , were selected from within @xmath4 of the radio position .",
    "time periods when the limb of the earth infringed upon the region of interest and when the rocking angle of the lat exceeded @xmath5 were excluded to reduce background .",
    "events were phase - folded using the fermi plug - in now provided with the tempo2 software @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-ray light curve is shown in figure 1 , a detailed analysis of the light curve can be found in @xcite .",
    "events with energies @xmath2 gev were used for spectral analysis .",
    "the fermi science tools ( sts ) v9r15p2 were used to perform a binned maximum likelihood analysis ( cash 1979 and mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) modeling all point sources found above the background with a test statistic @xmath6 in a preliminary version of the 1fgl catalog @xcite ; an extended source at the position of the vela x pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) @xcite ; and the v02 diffuse backgrounds , included with the fermi sts .",
    "the phase - averaged spectrum , figure 2 , is best fit as an exponentially cutoff power law , equation 1 , with the @xmath7 parameter @xmath8 1 : @xmath9\\ , \\ ] ] likely due to the superposition of many spectral components with @xmath10 and varying values of e@xmath11 and @xmath12 through the pulse .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "( @xmath13 ) & @xmath14 + @xmath12 & @xmath15 + e@xmath11 ( gev ) & @xmath16 + @xmath7 & @xmath17 + flux ( 0.1 - 100 gev ) ( @xmath18 ) & @xmath19 +      the light curve was divided into 101 variable - width bins with 1500 events each ( @xmath2 gev ) using the energy - dependent angular selection described in the caption of figure 1 .",
    "the smallest bin has a width of 0.0016 in phase ( @xmath20s ) .",
    "the spectrum of the vela pulsar was fit assuming a simple exponentially cutoff power law , @xmath10 , in each phase bin .",
    "normalizations of the diffuse backgrounds and point sources within @xmath21 of the pulsar were also kept free .",
    "the observed phase trends in @xmath12 and e@xmath11 are shown in figures 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "significant variation is seen in both parameters , confirming that the hardest emission is between the two peaks .",
    "e@xmath11 rises sharply through the main peaks and , suprisingly , between the peaks as well , following the position of the third peak observed at higher energies .",
    "phase - resolved analyses of egret data suggested a drastic change in @xmath12 through the two main peaks ; however , the lat data does not confirm this , instead finding @xmath12 to be very consistent with a constant value through both peaks .    to evaluate the significance of the features in figures 3 and 4",
    ", the pulsar and surrounding region were simulated using the fermi st _ gtobssim _ and the built - in _ pulsarspectrum _ @xcite .",
    "the lat - only timing parameters and spectral parameters from a phase - averaged fit with @xmath10 were used as input to the simulation .",
    "the vela x pwn was included as a point source .",
    "the simulation suggests that point - to - point variations of 0.6 gev in e@xmath11 and 0.05 in @xmath12 should be expected from the fitting technique . as such , point - to - point variations less than these values",
    "can not be considered significant .    to better evaluate the behavior of e@xmath11 in the two main peaks the fit was repeated but with @xmath12 fixed to the best - fit values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the first and second peaks , respectively .",
    "the resulting trends in e@xmath11 are shown in figures 5 and 6 for the first and second peaks , respectively .",
    "e@xmath11 rises fairly smoothly in both peaks with maxima near the start of the trailing edges .",
    "the he @xmath0-ray emission from pulsars has been theorized to be curvature radiation ( cr ) from electrons ( or positrons ) accelerated along the magnetic field lines by the parallel component of the electric field ( e@xmath24 ) ( romani 1996 and hirotani & shibata 1999 ) .",
    "the electrons will be cr reaction limited such that a steady - state lorentz factor is maintained .",
    "in outer - magnetospheric emission models ( e.g. muslimov & harding 2004 , slot gap ( sg ) ; zhang et al . 2004 ; and hirotani 2008 , outer gap ( og ) ) e@xmath24 depends on the value of the magnetic field at the light cylinder and the gap width .",
    "these models give similar cutoff energies , equation 2 ( units of mc@xmath25 ) , ranging from 1 to 5 gev , consistent with what is observed in vela and other @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "interestingly , the cutoff energy ( e@xmath27 ) depends on the local field line radius of curvature ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "emission across the pulse originates from different ranges of emission radii ( romani 1996 and cheng et al .",
    "2000 ( og ) and two - pole caustic ( tpc ) dyks & rudak 2003 ) , implying that phase - resolved spectroscopy should map out the emission altitude .",
    "large variations of @xmath28 with phase are also expected in these models and mapping the minimum @xmath28 , using basic geometric models , can produce trends similar to what is seen in figure 4 , but full radiation models will be needed to match all of the features . as the lat continues to accumulate more events from vela it will be possible to map the he @xmath0-ray emission regions in more detail and better understand the radiative processes involved .",
    "_ acknowledgements _ + the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states ; cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france ; asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan ; and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the parkes radio telescope is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth government for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "we thank our colleagues for their assistance with the radio timing observations .",
