    "we extend this formulation to rotational water waves with constant vorticity in two dimensions and for irrotational water waves in an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "the formulation by @xcite is based on the existence of the so - called _ global relation _ ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we recall that @xcite introduced an elegant dirichlet to neumann operator @xmath382 associated with the velocity potential and also obtained a series for the operator @xmath382 , valid for small @xmath10 .",
    "the integral equations present in @xcite and here , can be considered as the _ summation _ of the above series , i.e. the series of @xcite is the neumann series of the integral equations derived by @xcite and here .",
    "it appears that the new formulation provides an alternative , perhaps simpler approach , for ( a ) the numerical investigation of water waves ; ( b ) the derivation of various asymptotic limits ; ( c ) the rigorous analysis of water waves .",
    "regarding ( a ) , we recall that two - dimensional lumps were computed by @xcite in the case of sufficient surface tension .    regarding ( b ) we recall that various asymptotic equations , including the boussinesq , benney - luke and the nonlinear schrdinger equations , were derived by @xcite .",
    "similarly , an appropriate boussinesq type equation in the case of constant vorticity is found in  4 .",
    "we observe that these equations have been derived by several other authors , however , it appears that the new formulation provides a straightforward way of deriving these equations .",
    "for example , regarding our results in  4 , we note that @xcite uses a perturbative approach which involves solving many pdes arising from the consistency of the perturbation expansion with the boundary conditions . to solve these pdes , the author confines attention to seperable solutions .",
    "the entire paper is devoted to computing the first few coefficients of the perturbation expansion .",
    "the author comments that this method is unweildy at anything beyond second order .",
    "our paper gives a much more direct approach , and can easily be extended to higher orders .",
    "it is not immediately obvious as to whether his equations are exactly the same as ours , because our soliton equation is for the wave speed , whilst his are for the wave height .    regarding ( c )",
    "we have shown in  3 that standard pde techniques can be used for the rigorous analysis of water waves , at least in the linear limit .",
    "the new formulation suggests a rigorous methodology which differs drastically from that employed in the important works of @xcite ; the extension of the results of  3 to the nonlinear problem is a work in progress .",
    "finally , we note that in the classical works of @xcite , the author focuses entirely on the amplitude @xmath73 and does not include the effect of surface tension .",
    "in contrast , the solitons discussed in this work concern the wave speed , @xmath383 , and our formulation also includes the effect of surface tension .",
    "our analysis , particularly the results in proposition [ soliton_sometimes ] , outline the importance of the relationship between the surface tension and the vorticity for the existence of solitary waves .",
    "furthermore , our formalism can easily be extended to the three dimensional case .",
    "the main advantages of the new approach presented by @xcite and in this paper , are a consequence of the _ explicit _ nature of the equations in propositions [ global_inf ] , [ global_inf2 ] and [ global_inf3 ] .",
    "here we prove the result in proposition [ linear22 ] .",
    "it suffices to prove the estimate : @xmath384 given that @xmath385 .",
