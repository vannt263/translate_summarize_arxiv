    "q - balls @xcite , a kind of nontopological solitons @xcite , appear in a large family of field theories with global u(1 ) ( or more ) symmetry .",
    "in particular , it has been argued that q - balls with the affleck - dine ( ad ) potential could play important roles in cosmology @xcite .",
    "for example , q - balls can be produced efficiently and could be responsible for baryon asymmetry @xcite and dark matter @xcite . in the ad mechanism ,",
    "there are two types of potentials : gravity - mediation type and gauge - mediation type . here",
    ", we concentrate on the gravity - mediation type , [ ad ] v_ad():=^2   with   m^2 ,  m>0  . in general",
    ", there may be nonrenormalizable terms , u(1 ) violation terms , and so on . here",
    "we neglect them for simplicity . because q - balls are typically supposed to be microscopic objects , their self - gravity is usually ignored .",
    "therefore , stability of q - balls with various potentials has been intensively studied in flat spacetime @xcite . as for the ad potential ( [ ad ] ) , it has been known that equilibrium solutions for @xmath4 are nonexistent while those for @xmath1 are existent and stable .",
    "one may speculate that these properties are not changed by gravity if self - gravity is weak enough .    however , this speculation is not necessarily true for the following reasons .",
    "first , for the potential @xmath5 , no equilibrium solution exists without gravity but equilibrium solutions , called ( mini-)boson stars , exist due to self - gravity  @xcite .",
    "this is a direct evidence that there are equilibrium solutions for @xmath2 with ( [ ad ] ) .",
    "second , in our previous paper  @xcite , we considered gravitating q - balls with [ v4 ] v_4():=m^22 ^ 2-^4 +  with   m^2 ,  ,  m>0 .",
    "in flat spacetime q - balls with @xmath6 in the thick - wall limit are unstable and there is a minimum charge @xmath7 , where q - balls with @xmath8 are nonexistent .",
    "if we take self - gravity into account , on the other hand , there exist stable q - balls with arbitrarily small charge , no matter how weak gravity is .    therefore , it is valuable to examine the influence of gravity in ad potential ( [ ad ] ) . as a result",
    ", we find that upper bound of the q - ball charge appears due to gravity for @xmath1 and there appear  q - balls \" for @xmath4 which do not exist without gravity . here",
    "we call all equilibrium solutions  q - balls \" collectively , though solutions supported by gravity are usually called boson stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive equilibrium field equations . in sec .",
    "iii , we show numerical results of equilibrium q - balls for @xmath1 and discuss existence of  q - balls \" for @xmath4 . for @xmath2 , we explain why ",
    "q - balls \" called ( mini-)boson stars exist with the influence of gravity . in the same mechanism , there appear  q - balls \" even for @xmath3 . in this case ,  q - balls \" are surrounded by q - matter . in sec .",
    "iv , we devote to concluding remarks .",
    "we begin with the action [ sg ] s = d^4x\\ { -12g^__-v ( ) } , where @xmath9 is an so(2)-symmetric scalar field and @xmath10 .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric and static spacetime , [ metric1 ] ds^2=-^2(r)dt^2+a^2(r)dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) .",
    "for the scalar field , we assume that it has a spherically symmetric and stationary form , [ phase ] ( _ 1,_2)=(r)(t , t ) .",
    "then the field equations become [ gtt ] -r a^32g^t_t&:=&a+a2r(a^2 - 1 ) + & = & 4gr a^3(^22a^2 + ^2 ^ 22 ^ 2+v ) , + [ grr ]",
    "r2g_rr&:=&+2r(1-a^2 ) + & = & 4gra^2 ( ^22a^2+^2 ^ 22 ^ 2-v ) , + [ box ] a^2_1_1&:= &  + ( 2r+-aa) + ( a)^2 + & = & a^2dvd , where @xmath11 . to obtain q - ball solutions in curved spacetime , we should solve ( [ gtt])-([box ] ) with boundary conditions , & & a(0)=a()=()=1 , + & & a(0)=(0)=(0)=()=0 .",
    "[ bcg ] we also restrict our solutions to monotonically decreasing @xmath12 . because of the symmetry , there is a conserved charge called q - ball charge , [ q ] q&:= & d^3xg^0(_1__2-_2__1)=i , + & & where   i:=4dr .",
    "we suppose @xmath13 model ( [ ad ] ) . rescaling the quantities as & & ,   _",
    "ad= ( 1 + 2k ) ,   + & & ,  = gm^2 ,  mt ,   mr , [ rescale ] the field equations ( [ gtt])-([box ] ) are rewritten as [ rsfe1 ] a+a2(a^2 - 1 ) = 4a^3(2a^2+^2 ^ 22 ^ 2+_ad ) , [ rsfe2 ] +2(1-a^2 ) = 4a^2(2a^2+^2 ^ 22 ^ 2-_ad ) , [ rsfe3 ] ^+(2+-aa)+(a)^2=a^2d_add .      in preparation for discussing gravitating  q - balls \" ,",
    "we review their equilibrium solutions in flat spacetime ( @xmath14 ) . the scalar field equation ( [ rsfe3 ] )",
    "reduces to [ rsfeflat ] ^=--^2+d_add .",
    "this is equivalent to the field equation for a single static scalar field with the potential @xmath15 .",
    "equilibrium solutions satisfying boundary conditions ( [ bcg ] ) exist if [ excon ] max(v_)>_ad(0 )  and   d^2v_d^2(0)>0 .",
    "if we introduce @xmath16 , we obtain = ( ^2 + k+2k )  , [ origin1 ] + = ^2 + 3k+2k  .",
    "[ origin2 ] the second condition in ( [ excon ] ) leads to [ condition1 ] k<0  , or [ condition1 - 2 ] k=0  and  ^2 > 0  . in the former case ( [ condition1 ] ) , @xmath17 has a maximum at @xmath18 ; then the first condition in ( [ excon ] ) becomes _ 1 ^ 2 < 0  , [ condition2 ] which is trivially satisfied . in the latter case ( [ condition1 - 2 ] ) , there is no maximum ; then , there is no equilibrium solution .",
    "if one regards the radius @xmath19 as time  and the scalar amplitude @xmath20 as the position of a particle , one can understand q - ball solutions in words of newtonian mechanics , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "equation ( [ rsfeflat ] ) describes a one - dimensional motion of a particle under the conserved force due to the potential @xmath21 and the time - dependent friction @xmath22 .",
    "here we put @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in this case , the scalar field @xmath25 at the initial time @xmath26 rolls down the potential and finally reaches @xmath27 at the time @xmath28 .",
    "the potential picture described above is also effective to argue equilibrium solutions in curved spacetime . in this case",
    ", @xmath29 should be redefined by [ thick2 ] & & ^2 : = 1- .",
    "[ origin4 ] because the potential of a particle , @xmath30 , is now time - dependent , the existence conditions of equilibrium solutions are not as simple as those in flat spacetime .",
    "+    we discuss the existence of equilibrium solutions by analogy with newtonian mechanics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vk-001 ] ( a ) .",
    "we also exhibit behaviors of the metric functions in fig .",
    "[ vk-001 ] ( b ) .",
    "because @xmath30 depends on the time @xmath31 , it has a minimum at @xmath32 when @xmath33 while it has a minimum at @xmath34 when @xmath26 . at the initial time",
    "@xmath26 the scalar field at @xmath35 rolls down the potential and finally reaches @xmath27 at the time @xmath28 .",
    "we thus understand how gravity changes properties of equilibrium solutions .    as we discussed in our previous papers  @xcite , stability of q - balls",
    "can be easily understood from the relation between @xmath36 and the hamiltonian energy @xmath37 , which is defined by [ h ] e=_rr^22ga = m_s2 , where @xmath38 is the schwarzschild mass .",
    "here , stability means local stability , that is , stability against small perturbations .",
    "we also normalize @xmath37 and @xmath36 as [ enormalize ] : = ,   : = .",
    "we compare @xmath39-@xmath40 relation for the flat case ( @xmath41 ) with that for the gravitating case @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ qe ] . in the case that @xmath14 , @xmath39 is almost proportional to @xmath40 , and accordingly , all solutions for this parameter range are stable . in the case",
    "that @xmath43 , however , there is a cusp structure at the point @xmath44 , where stability changes .",
    "if there are two solutions for fixed @xmath39 , the solution with larger energy @xmath40 should be unstable .",
    "that is , the upper branch represents unstable solutions . at the same time",
    ", this cusp structure indicates that there is a maximum charge @xmath45 , where solutions with @xmath46 are nonexistent due to gravity .",
    "this is a common feature with @xmath47 and @xmath48 models  @xcite .",
    "if we take larger ( smaller ) @xmath49 , the point corresponding to @xmath44 has smaller ( larger ) @xmath40 .",
    "however , qualitative features do not change .",
    "this case corresponds to the potential for the mini - boson stars , which have been investigated in the literatures  @xcite .",
    "first , we explain why mini - boson stars appear if we include self - gravity .",
    "the key point is that the sign of @xmath50 depends on @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ vk0 ] shows how the shape of @xmath30 changes as @xmath31 varies .",
    "the scalar field rolls down the potential @xmath30 near @xmath26 while it climbs up @xmath30 in the asymptotic region . as a result",
    ", the scalar field at the initial position  @xmath51 satisfies the asymptotic boundary condition @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of flat spacetime , because @xmath30 is a monotonically decreasing ( increasing ) function of @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , there is no equilibrium solution .",
    "we also show @xmath39-@xmath40 relation for @xmath2 and @xmath42 in fig .",
    "the result is similar to that for @xmath23 .",
    "there is a maximum charge @xmath45 .",
    "the lower branch represents stable solutions while the upper branch unstable .      as in the case that @xmath2 , the shape of @xmath17 depends on @xmath56",
    "figure  [ vk01 ] shows the potential @xmath30 for @xmath57 , @xmath58 at @xmath26 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , because @xmath59 regardless of @xmath29 , there is no q - ball solution which satisfies ( [ bcg ] ) even if we include gravity .",
    "however , we should notice @xmath30 maximum around @xmath60 in the large @xmath31 region .",
    "figure [ vk01 ] indicates that if the scalar field rolls down from @xmath61 , there is a solution which satisfies @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "we show the example of such a solution in fig .",
    "[ config ] for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "we have also confirmed that this kind of solution is generic for @xmath3 .",
    "our solutions are not asymptotically flat but surrounded by q - matter .",
    "because the energy @xmath37 and the charge @xmath36 are diverging , we can not apply energetics or catastrophe theory to these solutions .",
    "stability analysis is the next important issue .",
    "we have investigated gravitating ",
    "q - balls \" in the gravity - mediated ad mechanism ( [ ad ] ) .",
    "contrary to the flat case , in which equilibrium solutions exist only if @xmath1 , we have found three types of gravitating solutions as follows . in the case",
    "that @xmath1 , ordinary q - ball solutions exist ; there is an upper bound of the charge due to gravity . in the case",
    "that @xmath2 , equilibrium solutions called ( mini-)boson stars appear due to gravity ; there is an upper bound of the charge , too . in the case",
    "that @xmath3 , equilibrium solutions appear , too . in this case , these solutions are not asymptotically flat but surrounded by q - matter .",
    "it is worth noting that because the amplitude of the scalar field can grow even for @xmath3  @xcite , our solution may play an important role as dark matter .",
    "our present work as well as previous work @xcite suggests that self - gravity may change properties of the solutions even if it is weak .",
    "therefore , it may be important to extend our approach to other models such as the gauge - mediation type",
