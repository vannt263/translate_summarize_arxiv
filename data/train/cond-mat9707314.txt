    "problems dealing with the localization of random walks in potentials of various geometries compel much attention of different groups of scientists : both chemists and physicists . for the first group these problems",
    "are naturally connected with creating a new materials possessing specific technological properties ( for instance , catalysts @xcite or ion containing and surface active substances @xcite ) . meanwhile , for physicists the consideration of random walks localization remains since 70 s the firing ground for elaborating the new methods of the investigation of a polymer absorption in different geometries , wetting phenomena and kinetics of chemical reactions .",
    "the phenomenon of polymer chain absorption is rather well understood at present both for homo @xcite@xcite , @xcite and heteropolymer @xcite@xcite cases .",
    "the simple diffusive approach @xcite provides complete understanding of an absorption of homopolymer chains as well as of block  copolymers in complicated geometries .",
    "these results can be beautifully explained also by scaling estimates @xcite .",
    "more advanced renormalization group methods @xcite and power series analysis @xcite applied to random chains with a disordered sequence of links are also widely used and give an exhaustive information about the thermodynamic properties of ideal polymers near the point of phase transition from the delocalized ( gaussian ) to the localized ( absorbed ) fluctuation regimes .",
    "the similar mathematical formalism has been applied to a description of a phase transition in solid  on  solid ( sos ) models with quenched impurities @xcite .",
    "many conclusions obtained by rg analysis in @xcite correlate with the results in @xcite .",
    "problems dealing with 2d wetting subject to a layer of periodic potential could be attributed to this theme as well . in @xcite using a generalized transfer matrix method , we were able to find the exact solution for the critical depinning phase transition .    finally , it is worthwhile to mention that the model considered below has some features of so - called `` zero s range process '' @xcite emerged in connection with traffic models .",
    "also , similar set of problems appeared in course of investigation of the `` autolocalization '' phenomena @xcite and in the theory of multicomponent chemical reactions on traps immersed in an immovable `` matrix '' @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    "we formulate the simple model of `` catalytic absorption '' and put forward the question of our main interest ; section [ sec:2 ] is devoted to the solution of one and two  particle problems ; the consideration of the phase transition in the @xmath0particle model for @xmath7 is given in section [ sec:3 ] ; while in section [ sec:4 ] we present conjectures about the connection of the multiparticle catalytic absorption with the random copolymer absorption at the point well .",
    "consider the one  dimensional lattice @xmath8 , i.e. the set of integer points on the halfline @xmath1 , @xmath9 .",
    "take @xmath0 independent @xmath10step simplest random walks on @xmath8 , simultaneously starting at the point @xmath2 .",
    "all these walks are free , i.e. they do not interact neither with any external potential , nor with each others in all points except the point @xmath2 . at the point",
    "@xmath2 the interaction of a given random walk with the well is described by the potential @xmath11 ( the index @xmath12 $ ] lables the different random walks ) : [ eq:1 ] u(x_1,x_2,  ,x_n)=\\ {    ll 0 & + u^(1 ) & + u^(2 ) & + & + u^(n ) &    .",
    "where [ eq:1.1 ] 0u^(1)u^(2)u^(n ) and [ eq:2 ] u^(i)f(i);i    the equations ( [ eq:1])([eq:2 ] ) reflect the fact that the depth of the potential well depends on the number of particles ( i.e. steps of different random walks ) _ simultaneously _ located at the point @xmath2see fig.[fig:1 ] .",

    "we are interested in the situation when the number of particles jumping on @xmath8 ( i.e. the number of different random walks ) is very large ( @xmath23 ) and the number of steps of each random walk tends to infinity ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we expect that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath25 and for @xmath3 the absorption transition into localized state at the point @xmath2 is sensitive to the shape of the function @xmath26 .",
    "namely , if @xmath26 grows rather slowly with @xmath0 ( for the precise criteria of the growth see the section [ sec:3 ] ) we could expect that the phase transitions occur in each individual random walk independently ; while if @xmath26 is rather sharp function of @xmath0 , various types of _ collective _ localization are expected .",
    "the interplay between the entropy loss and the energy gain in the localized states makes the phase behavior of the system under consideration extremely rich .    the most attention in our work is paid to exact determination of the critical shape of the function @xmath26 at which the localization transition occurs simultaneously in all @xmath0 ( @xmath27 ) random walks .",
    "to avoid further misunderstandings let us define precisely what we mean under the `` localization '' of the random walk .",
    "let @xmath28 be the free energy of the @xmath10step random walk on the halfline @xmath8 with the point well of depth @xmath29 at the origin @xmath2 .",
    "this model can be described via the diffusion  type equation with specific boundary conditions ( compare to eq.([eq:3 ] ) ) and there exists some critical value @xmath30 which separates two different behaviors of the free energy : @xmath31 the value @xmath32 we call the `` localization transition point '' .",
    "it signals the separation of the highest eigenvalue @xmath33 from the continous spectrum of the diffusion  type equation .",
    "let us start with the simplest situation when @xmath35 , i.e. we have a single simplest random walk on @xmath8 interacting with the potential well at the origin .    in this case eqs.([eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) degenerate to the following ones : [ eq:4 ] u(x)=\\ {    ll 0 & + u^(1 ) &    . and [ eq:5 ] \\",

    "thus , for @xmath35 we have only one particle jumping on the halfline and the problem is nothing else as a simple absorption at the `` point well '' located at the origin @xmath2 .",
    "the solution of the one  particle problem is very straightforward .",
    "let us make the shift @xmath36 .",

    "perform the substitution [ eq:5.0 ] z_n(x)=2^n z_n(x ) and use the fourier ",

    "consider now two particles jumping on the halfline , i.e. two trajectories of random walks simultaneously developing in `` time '' @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "these trajectories are independent on each others in all points @xmath49 except the point @xmath2 .",
    "let us call the current coordinates of 1st and 2nd random walks @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspondingly .",

    "the answer is very straightforward : _ the condition on the critical shape @xmath126 providing the joint @xmath0particle localization is defined by setting @xmath127 in the equation ( [ eq:26b ] ) with @xmath124 extracted from ( [ eq:28])_.    the approximate evaluation of the integral ( [ eq:28 ] ) for @xmath3 gives us ( with the exponential accuracy  see appendix for details ) : [ eq:29 ] _",
    "n=(nn -n + o(n ) ) we drop in eq.([eq:28 ] ) all terms growing with @xmath27 slower than @xmath128 .    substituting ( [ eq:28 ] ) into ( [ eq:26a ] )",
    "it is easy to conclude that for @xmath3 the term @xmath120 has the maximal value in the sum ( [ eq:26a ] ) : [ eq:30 ] _",
    "n = e^n n where we kept the leading asymptotics ( for @xmath27 ) only .",
    "estimating the sum ( [ eq:26a ] ) with the same accuracy , we arrive at the following final conclusion :    * if the function @xmath26 grows faster than @xmath129 then * all @xmath3 particles are localized simultaneously * in the point well located at the origin @xmath2 of the halfline @xmath8 .",
    "recall that @xmath130 is the depth of just the @xmath0particle well .",
    "thus the `` integral '' critical depth , @xmath131 per the cluster of @xmath0 particles ( i.e. steps of different random walks at the point @xmath2 ) has the following asymptotic behavior @xmath132    if the integral potential at the origin @xmath133 grows ( with @xmath134 ) slower than @xmath135 then only a finite fraction of random walks remains at the origin in the localized state .",
    "the above mentioned problem has a direct application to the old problem of the random copolymer absorption at the point well .",
    "namely consider the random walk on @xmath8 with the point well located at the origin and suppose that the well depth depends on the current `` time '' ( i.e. the number of the random walk step ) at the point @xmath2 .",
