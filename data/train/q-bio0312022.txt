    "the difficulty of developing fully scalable technologies which can be equally applied to both very small and very large systems explains much of the current fascination with network analysis .",
    "this field examines how growing networks can display stationary ( size independent ) scale free or exponential statistics which are unchanging over vast size ranges , and this field will naturally focus on the very large and obvious networks possessing readily obtainable statistics such as the internet , the world wide web and movie databases .",
    "however , there is an entire class of networks equally important to human society , technology and biology which possess nonstationary ( size dependent ) connectivity statistics and which are thereby forced to undergo structural transitions as they grow sometimes so severe as to limit growth entirely  for a review see @xcite .",
    "the resulting limited size of these networks makes them less obvious but does not decrease their relevance .",
    "in particular , prokaryote gene regulatory networks exploiting homology based ( sequence specific ) interactions will display nonstationary or  accelerating \" statistics where the link number per node grows linearly with network size ( so total link number grows quadratically with network size ) , so these networks will be inherently constrained to have sizes less than about 20,000 genes @xcite .",
    "in fact , all prokaryotic gene numbers and genomes are indeed of restricted size ( less than about 10,000 genes with genomes of between 0.5 and 10 megabases @xcite ) , in contrast to the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes ( with for humans , about 30,000 genes and a genome of about 3 gigabases @xcite ) .",
    "the rapidly expanding field of network analysis , reviewed in @xcite , has provided examples of networks exhibiting  accelerating \" network growth where link number grows faster than linearly with network size @xcite . for instance , the internet @xcite appears to grow by adding links more quickly than sites though the relative change over time is small and the internet appears to remain scale free and well characterized by stationary statistics @xcite .",
    "similarly , the number of links per substrate in the metabolic networks of organisms appears to increase linearly with substrate number @xcite , the average number of links per scientist in collaboration networks increases linearly over time @xcite , and languages appear to evolve via accelerated growth @xcite .",
    "even social networks take on their small world characteristics only when the network is large enough  in small towns everyone knows everyone else so social networks are accelerating and exhibit a transition to small world statistics only as individual nodes saturate their connectivity limits @xcite .",
    "accelerating networks are more prevalent and important in society and in biology than is commonly realized @xcite .    a  probabilistic \" accelerating model of prokaryote regulatory gene networks has been developed in ref .",
    "this involved the use of probabilistic links to allow arbitrarily rapid acceleration rates , two distinct classes of nodes where  regulators \" can source outbound regulatory links to regulate other nodes ( both regulators and non - regulators ) while  non - regulators \" can not source outbound links , directed links from regulators to regulated nodes , and distinct connectivity distributions describing the long - tailed and scale - free distribution of outbound link number per regulator and the compact and exponential distribution of the inbound link number per node .",
