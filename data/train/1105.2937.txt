    "consider the following numerical experiment , which is also exhibited in fig .",
    "[ britvsduct ] and in the movies available in @xcite . a piece of amorphous solid at rest is contained in the square ( pink ) box as plotted .",
    "the material is prepared by quenching a binary liquid of point particles ( see potentials below ) , and removing the periodic boundaries .",
    "the resulting system has side walls consisting of pinned particles ( identical to the bulk particles , blue and brown in fig .",
    "[ britvsduct ] ) forming a rigid body which is pulled , the upper and lower boundaries are free .",
    "the walls are moved by an increment equal in size and opposite in sign .    in the upper panel",
    "the material is brittle , and can not deform much before it fractures . in the lower panel",
    "the material is ductile , and the distance between the walls increases by about a factor of two before the plastic deformation that is induced creates a thin neck that is eventually broken .",
    "the huge difference in response is obtained with materials in the two panels that are identical in every respect except for the cutoff length of the attractive part of their inter - particle potentials , see fig .",
    "[ potentials ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the intrinsic relation between the microscopic properties of the inter - particle potential and the brittle to ductile transition .",
    "we explicitly do not consider in this paper the interesting effects of temperature , aspect ratio , system size and dimensionality , which of course are also important in determining a material s brittleness .",
    "one of our main motivations in this paper is a mystery that had clouded the fracture literature for a number of years now .",
    "the issue is crack propagation in amorphous solids under grip boundary conditions . in experiments",
    "one can pull the boundaries of a given sample and grip them , and then cut a slot at the edge of the sample @xcite . in brittle materials",
    "this leads to a fast development of the a dynamic fracture ( when the length of the initial slot exceeds the griffith s length @xcite ) .",
    "for some unknown reason one always failed to repeat such experiments in direct molecular dynamic simulations , leading recently to some claims that only by defining ` bonds ' between particles and letting these bonds ` break ' under some criteria one can sustain a dynamical brittle fracture @xcite .",
    "obviously this is not a satisfactory answer ; here we argue that the mystery is removed when one understands what makes a material brittle or ductile , and in truly brittle materials there is no problem in seeing a dynamical fracture under grip boundary conditions .    in this paper",
    "we want to understand how the response of an amorphous system subjected to uniaxial load depends on the parameters of the potential , and in particular the cut - off length @xmath0 . this will provide us with a fair insight into the athermal brittle to ductile transition .",
    "we will relate the degree of ductility to the growing importance of the contribution of `` plastic modes '' to the density of states of the material .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ systems ] we describe the glassy system used and how we control the range of the inter - particle potential . the numerical experiments and their results are described in sect .",
    "[ experiments ] . in sect .",
    "[ plastic ] we relate and explain the findings of sect .",
    "[ experiments ] to the density of states of the glassy materials , explaining that with increasing the range of the potential one changes the weight of the contribution of the plastic modes in the density of states .",
    "this correlates very well with the tendency towards ductility as seen in the numerical experiments .",
    "finally in sect.[fracture ] we focus on the riddle of brittle fractures and show that there is no riddle at all - one simply needs to make the material brittle enough to allow brittle fractures to run spontaneously under grip boundary conditions . in sect .",
    "[ summary ] we conclude the paper and reiterate the dramatic effect of the inter - particle s potential properties on the behavior of a material under load @xcite .",
    "for the numerical experiments we employ a generic glass former in 2-dimensions in the form of a binary mixture whose amount of bi - dispersity of ` small ' and ` large ' particles was chosen to avoid any crystallization .",
    "in fact the particles interact by inter - particle potentials as shown in fig .",
    "[ potentials ] , with the analytic form    -1 .",

    "the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 are chosen such that the repulsive and attractive parts of the potential are continuous with two derivatives at the potential minimum and the potential goes to zero continuously at @xmath3 with two continuous derivatives as well .",

    "the unit of length @xmath12 is set to be the interaction length scale of two small particles , @xmath13 is the unit of energy and @xmath14 .",
    "the systems employed in the pulling experiments consist of configurations which were quenched from systems initially equilibrated at high temperature and pressure ( @xmath15 ) with periodic boundary conditions . the number of particles @xmath16 varied between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we used a modified berendsen thermostat which couples a constant number of particles to the bath , regardless of the system size @xcite .",
    "the systems are cooled to temperature @xmath19 while keeping the pressure high , in order to avoid the creation of any holes in the material .",
    "then the pressure is reduced to zero , @xmath20 , such that the periodic boundary conditions could be removed ; particles forming the right and left walls were frozen , but the upper and lower boundaries were rendered free .    from this point",
    "the system was treated differently for the brittle crack and the necking experiments .",
    "the brittle crack experiment starts by loading the system uniaxially ( with a constant velocity such that @xmath21 ) until a desired stress is reached , and then the side walls are held fixed .",
    "a cut is then implemented by the cancelation of forces crossing an imaginary line of desired length which starts at the lower boundary",
    ". the evolution of the crack is simulated by molecular dynamics at @xmath22 and requires no further loading of the system .",
    "the necking experiments were conducted in athermal quasi - static conditions .",
    "for those experiments the systems were further minimized with respect to the acting forces on each particle , making them athermal .",
    "the right and left walls were then moved with a strain increment @xmath23 .",
    "the response we investigate is the relative increase in the system s length @xmath24 along the stretching direction . the maximal value that the system is able to accommodate before it breaks into two parts is denoted as @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "[ bare ] we exhibit the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath0 for square systems @xmath29",

    "the potential gets shorter than the first shell of neighbors .",
    "the upper limit is determined by the convergence of our 1-parameter family of potentials to the asymptotic lennard - jones potential . within this range of potentials @xmath33",
    "was evaluated by averaging over 4500 samples .",
    "it is found to increase smoothly with @xmath0 reaching a limiting value @xmath34 . when the system reaches the limiting value @xmath34 we refer to it as  maximally ductile \" .",
    "the qualitative understanding of the result shown in fig .",
    "[ bare ] is quite straightforward . in the limit @xmath35",
    "any cavity that forms whose dimensions is larger than @xmath0 will not heal since there are no attractive forces operating across it .",
    "rather , it will propagate rapidly to span the system in a form of a brittle fracture . with @xmath0 increasing ,",
    "a small cavity will still be held by attractive forces across it .",
    "the higher is @xmath0 the larger is the number of neighbors that each particles feels attracted to , and one needs to create a very large cavity indeed to overcome these attractive forces . on the other hand when @xmath0 increases beyond the second shell of the binary correlation function ,",
    "not much can change . with our choice of potentials , in the limit @xmath36 we simply converge to the infinite - range lennard - jones potential which has a negligible attractive force beyond , say , @xmath37 .",
    "this qualitative understanding is further supported by examining the contribution of the plastic modes to the density of states , as we do next .",
    "it is well known that in amorphous solids the density of states deviates from the classical debye formula which was developed for a perfect elastic solid .",
    "the deviations were referred to as the boson peak but very little reliable analytic statements were made about the form of this deviation @xcite . in recent work of the present group",
    "it was proposed that one can provide a useful analytic form of the density of states ( the hklp model @xcite ) which will be particularly useful at the low end tail of frequencies . in terms of the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath7th normal mode frequency",
    "the proposed model is @xmath40 \\ , \\label{hklpmodel}\\ ] ] where the first term on the rhs is the debye formula in which @xmath16 is the number of particles , @xmath41 the space dimension and @xmath42 is the debye cutoff frequency which in 2-dimensions reads @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the shear modulus . the second term is our proposed addition to the model density of states that should be appropriate for all generic amorphous solids in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "this term contains contributions from eigenvalues @xmath46 that depend on the external mechanical loading , and go to zero with increasing the load , harking the appearance of plastic instabilities @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath47 in this plastic contribution is not universal , it depends on the amount of disorder in the glassy system , and it was shown to be an important characteristic of the mechanical properties of amorphous solids @xcite .    in numerical calculations",
    "it is easier to evaluate the cumulative distribution @xmath48 , whose form is @xmath49 \\ . \\label{cum}\\ ] ]    in the present context we wish to understand the relation between the tendency towards ductility as @xmath0 increases to the amount of plasticity as expressed , say , by the value of the weight coefficient @xmath50 and the exponent @xmath47 .",
    "to this aim we have computed the cumulative density of states @xmath51 and subtracted from it the exactly known debye contribution .",
    "the resulting plots are shown in fig .",
    "we see that the model [ hklpmodel ] is faithfully representing the data for small values of @xmath0 , whereas for the largest ones the amount of plastic modes increases beyond the first term contribution in the model .",
    "this is however not causing any difficulty in estimating the weight @xmath50 ( the intercept in fig .",
    "[ clam ] ) which is shown in fig .",
    "[ correl ] .",
    "cm    it is quite obvious that our @xmath25 dependence on @xmath0 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ bare ] ) is qualitatively similar to the dependence of the weight @xmath50 on @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore natural to plot @xmath25 as a function of @xmath50 .",

    "cm    we are now able to construct a system where all the microscopic parameters are tuned to minimize the occurrence of plastic events , a system which can be denoted ` maximally brittle ' .",
    "we expect such a system to fail under grip boundary conditions upon the application of a cut in one of the free boundaries . for a large value of @xmath0",
    ", a small cavity can still be held by attractive forces across it .",
    "the longer is @xmath0 the larger is the number of neighbors that each particles feels attracted to , and one needs to create a very large cavity indeed to overcome these attractive forces . on the other hand , in the limit of @xmath53 any cavity that forms",
    "whose dimensions is larger than @xmath0 can not heal since there are no attractive forces operating across it .",
    "rather , it would propagate rapidly to span the system in a form of a brittle fracture .",
    "the system we used to demonstrate this concept is composed of @xmath54 particles with a cut - off length of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; this choice was made to increase the stability of the system and prevents any unwanted events during the loading part of the simulation .",
    "the experiment is run by means of molecular dynamics at @xmath22 .",
    "the size of the cut is 100@xmath12 .",
    "the evolution of the crack can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ brittle ] .",
    "when the fracture originates from a cut , the system does not need to create a cavity in order to propagate a crack .",
    "the stress field around the tip of the cut is greatly enhanced by the strong curvature of the boundary , and once the griffith s criterion is fulfilled the crack can run . nevertheless during the propagation of the crack we observe many times the formation of a cavity ahead of the crack tip followed by necking to coalesce the cavity with the body of the crack .",
    "the observed dynamics is presented in fig .",
    "[ cavities ] , which employs snapshots from the brittle crack development that is shown in fig .",
    "[ brittle ] .",
    "we note in passing that this mechanism of propagation of brittle cracks was seen experimentally in ref . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this same mechanism was proposed as the reason for the roughening of the fracture surface .",
    "this roughening is seen to the bare eye in fig .",
    "[ brittle ] ; its quantitative assessment and its relation to the mechanism in question will be considered in a future publication .",
    "the main result of this paper is the dramatic change in material mechanical properties that results from changing the inter - particle potential interaction length .",
    "we introduced the athermal brittle to ductile transition , showing that even at @xmath57 we can go all the way from brittle to ductile response only by changing the cutoff length @xmath0 .",
    "there is an interesting analogy between increasing the cutoff length and raising the temperature ; in both case the system becomes ` softer ' .",
    "this softening can be quantitatively described by our model of density of states of amorphous solids , in which the coefficient @xmath50 measures the increasing weight of plastic modes , which are those eigenfunctions of the hessian matrix whose eigenvalues vanish in saddle - node bifurcations when the system is strained @xcite .",
    "indeed , we found a linear dependence between the degree of lengthening of the system before breaking and @xmath52 .",
    "finally , the new understanding of brittleness vs. ductility allowed us to disperse a long standing conundrum - how to get a brittle crack running under grip boundary conditions .",
    "it turns out that previous attempts failed simply because the system chosen were not brittle enough . building a ` maximally brittle ' material results in a nice running crack under grip boundary conditions as seen in many experiments .",
    "this work had been supported in part by an advanced  ideas \" grant of the european research council , the israel science foundation and the german israeli foundation .",
    "we thank edan lerner for useful discussions .",
    "there exist materials in which the necking instability results in a very thin thread that connects the tips of the triangular shapes which are left behind .",
    "we do not observe such threads in our simulations and our value of @xmath58 should be understood without the formation of atomic chains ."
