    "the proposed duality @xcite of the singlet sector of the @xmath1 vector model in three space - time dimensions and vasiliev s higher spin gauge theory in ads@xmath5 @xcite has received a definite verification@xcite and has also thrown valuable light on the origins of holography .",
    "since the field theory is solvable in the large - n limit , one might hope that there is an explicit derivation of the higher spin gauge theory from the vector model , thus providing an explicit understanding of the emergence of the holographic direction .",
    "indeed , the singlet sector of the @xmath1 model can be expressed in terms of a hamiltonian for the bi - local collective field , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath1 vector field . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed that vasiliev s fields are in fact components of @xmath8 .",
    "the precise connection between the bi - local and hs bulk fields was written explicitly in the light cone frame@xcite : the correspondence in general involves a nonlocal transformation corresponding to a canonical transformation in phase space .",
    "this provides a direct understanding of the emergence of a holographic direction from the large - n degrees of freedom , in a way similar to the well known example of the @xmath9 matrix model @xcite . in both these models ,",
    "the large - n degrees of freedom gave rise to an additional dimension which had to be interpreted as a _ spatial _ dimension .",
    "in contrast to ads / cft correspondence , any ds / cft correspondence @xcite involves an emergent holographic direction which is _ timelike_. it is then of interest to understand how a _ timelike _",
    "dimension is generated from large - n degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , anninos , hartman and strominger @xcite put forward a conjecture that the _ euclidean _ @xmath0 vector model in three dimensions is dual to vasiliev higher spin theory in four dimensional de sitter space .    in this work",
    "we construct a collective field theory of the _ lorentzian _ @xmath0 model which captures the singlet state dynamics of the @xmath0 vector model . using the results of @xcite and @xcite",
    "we then argue that a natural interpretation of the resulting action is by double analytic continuation which makes the emergent direction time - like , relating this to higher spin theory in ds@xmath5 , in a way reminiscent of the way the louiville mode in worldsheet string theory has to be interpreted as a time beyond critical dimensions @xcite .",
    "our map establishes the bi - local theory as the bulk space - time representation of de sitter higher spin gravity .",
    "the bilocal collective field is a composite of two grassmann variables and therefore might not appear to be a genuine bosonic field . in particular for finite @xmath2 a sufficiently large power of the field operator vanishes , reflecting its grassmannian origin .",
    "this is further reflected on the size of its hilbert space .",
    "the bulk theory can not be a usual bosonic theory defined on ds space , though it may be regarded as such in a perturbative @xmath10 expansion .",
    "the implementation of the grassmann origin of the hilbert space will be given a central attention in the present work .",
    "for this we will describe a geometric ( pseudo - spin ) version of the collective theory which will be seen to incorporate these effects . for ds / cft",
    ", this implies that the true number of degrees of freedom in the dual higher spin theory in ds is in this framework reduced from what is seen perturbatively ( with @xmath11 being the coupling constant squared ) .",
    "the issue of the size of the hilbert space is of central relevance for possible accounting of entropy of de sitter space . for pure gravity in de sitter space",
    ", it has argued that the entropy being @xmath12 with a finite area of the horizon requires a finite dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "interesting quantum mechanical models have been proposed @xcite to account for this . but",

    "_ this fact will play a key role in the following .    in the following",
    "it will be necessary to consider wavefunctions .",

    "we should get the same result from the collective theory . recalling that the collective wavefunction is related to the original wavefunction by a jacobian factor",

    "the saddle point solution is ( _ 1,_2 ) = ( _ 1-_2 ) once again we have chosen the positive sign in the solution of the saddle point equation , and the saddle point value of the collective field agrees with the two point correlation function of the basic vector field , which should be positive .",

    "the hamiltonian for the collective theory is obtained by the same method used to obtain the collective theory in the bosonic case , with various negative sign coming from the grassmann nature of the variables . using the chain rule and taking care of negative signs coming because of grassmann numbers ,",
    "one gets the jacobian @xmath55 ( determined by requiring the hermicity of @xmath56 ) j^ ( ) = a^  ^-(n+1 ) [ four - five ] where @xmath57 is a constant . the negative power of @xmath54 of course reflects the grassmann nature of the variables dependence of the jacobian follows from a direct calculation @xmath58 despite this difference , the final collective hamiltonian is in fact _ identical _ to the @xmath53 oscillator collective hamiltonian h_coll^sp(2n ) = -2 + + k^2 [ four - seven ] this leads to the same saddle point equation , and the solutions satisfy the same equation as ( [ twofive ] ) with @xmath59 .    in the @xmath53 oscillator , we had to choose the positive sign , since @xmath33 is by definition a real _ positive _ variable . in this case , there is no reason for @xmath54 to be positive .",

    "we will now argue that we need to quantize this theory rather differently , in a way similar to the treatment of @xcite .",

    "it is easy to see that this standard quantization does not reproduce the correct two - point function of the @xmath0 theory , does not lead to the correct spectrum ( [ afour ] ) and , as shown below , does not lead to the correct wavefunction .",
    "all this happens because @xmath54 and hence @xmath65 is not really a bosonic variable , and this allows other possibilities .",
    "consider now a state @xmath66 which is annihilated by the annihilation operator @xmath62 .",
    "this leads to a wavefunction @xmath67 $ ] , which is inadmissible if @xmath65 is really a bosonic variable since it would be non - normalizable .",
    "however the true integration is over the grassmann partons of these collective fields , and in terms of grassmann integration this wavefunction is perfectly fine .",
    "this is in fact the state which has to be identified with the ground state of the @xmath0 oscillator . including the factor of the jacobian , the full wavefunction is ( at large @xmath2 ) _ 0^= [ j^()]^-1/2exp[k^2 ] = [ - + 2 ] ^n/2 exp[k^2 ] [ cfive ] expanding the jacobian factor in powers of",

    "once again we need to take into account the interaction terms in the collective hamiltonian to check that the @xmath69 terms cancel .",
    "it can be easily verified that the propagator of fluctuations @xmath65 will now be _ negative _ of the usual harmonic oscillator propagator .",
    "furthermore the action of @xmath61 now generates a tower of states with the energies ( [ afour ] ) - except that the integer @xmath70 is not bounded by @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that we get an unbounded ( from above ) spectrum from the collective theory is not a surprise .",
    "this is an expansion around @xmath71 and at @xmath71 the spectrum of @xmath0 is also unbounded . at finite @xmath2 a change of variables to @xmath54",
    "is not useful because of the constraints coming from the grassmann origin of @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , even in the @xmath10 expansion , the grassmann origin allows us to consider wavefunctions which would be otherwise considered inadmissible .",
    "the negative propagator ensures that the relationship ( [ four - two1 ] ) is satisfied for the 2 point functions .",
    "once this choice is made , the relationship ( [ four - two1 ] ) holds for all @xmath72-point functions to the leading order in the large-@xmath2 limit .",
    "as commented earlier , a term with even number of @xmath64 or @xmath65 would have an odd number of factors of @xmath73 .",
    "therefore a @xmath70-point vertex in the theory will differ from the corresponding @xmath70-point vertex of the @xmath1 theory by a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "the connected correlator which appears in ( [ four - two1 ] ) is the sum of all connected tree diagrams with @xmath70 external legs .",
    "the collective theory gives us the following feynman rules    * every propagator contributes to a negative sign .",
    "* a @xmath75 point vertex has a factor of @xmath76    we now argue that these rules ensure the validity of the basic relation ( [ four - two ] ) .",
    "we do it by the following simple diagrammatic method :        consider first the simplest diagram for a @xmath70-point function , figure a , which is a star graph .",
    "the net sign of the diagram is @xmath77 , where the first factor is from the vertex @xmath78 and the second one from the number of lines .",
    "now we proceed to construct all other tree level diagrams from a , by pulling ` @xmath79 ' lines resulting in figure b , which now has vertices , @xmath80 and @xmath81 joined by a new line .",
    "it is easy to see , that the sign of figure a is not changed by this operation .",
    "the net sign of figure b is @xmath82 , where the 3 factors are from @xmath80 , @xmath81 and the number of lines respectively . in figure c",
    "we repeat this method for the substar diagrams until we exhaust all possibilities .",

    ", we first find the net sign of the left diagram in figure c. it turns out to be , @xmath84 .",
    "after the  pulling \" operation we get @xmath85 . thus it is proved that in every move the sign is preserved .",
    "this proves the relationship ( [ four - two1 ] ) for all correlation functions .",
    "our discussion of the bosonic @xmath1 collective field theory shows that the @xmath0 collective field theory in momentum space is a straightforward generalization . in this subsection",
    "we discuss the relevant features of the collective theory for the free @xmath0 model .",

    "under a double analytic continuation this becomes the action in ds@xmath5 with positive kinetic terms .",

    "the sign of the kinetic term for the liouville mode is negative for @xmath109 .    even for the @xmath1 model ,",
    "the collective field is an represents seemingly an overcomplete description , since for a finite number of points in space @xmath110 , one replaces at most @xmath111 variables by @xmath112 variables , which is much larger in the thermodynamic and continuum limit .",

    "the issue becomes of significance at finite @xmath2 level.the relevance of incorporating for such features has been noted in @xcite .",
    "for the fermionic @xmath0 model , there appears potentially an even more important redundancy related to the grassmannian origin of the construction .",
    "consequently the fields are to obey nontrivial constraint relationships and the hilbert space is subject to a cutoff of highly excited states .",
    "this ` exclusion principle ' was noted already in the ads correspondence involving @xmath113 orbifolds@xcite .    in an expansion around @xmath114 most effects of this",
    "are invisible and our discussion shows that this can be regarded as a theory of higher spin fields in ds is insensitive to these effects .",
    "however , as we saw above , the grassmann origin was already of importance in choosing the correct saddle point and the correct quanization of the quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "in the next section we will address the question of finite @xmath2 and the hilbert space of the bi - local theory . in the framework of geometric ( pseudospin ) representation we will give evidence that the bi - local theory is non - perturbatively satisfactory at the finite @xmath2 level .",
    "the bi - local collective field representation is seen to give a bulk description ds space and the higher spin fields .",
    "it provides an interacting theory with vertices governed by @xmath115 as the coupling constant .",
    "we would now to show that the collective theory has an equivalent geometric ( pseudo ) spin variable description appropriate for nonperturbative considerations .",
    "the essence of this ( geometric ) description is in reinterpreting the bi - local collective fields ( and their canonical conjugates ) as matrix variables ( of infinite dimensionality ) endowed with a kahler structure.this geometric description will provide a tractable framework for quantization and non - perturbative definition of the bi - local and hs de sitter theory . it will be seen capable to incorporate non - perturbative features related to the grassmannian origin of bi - local fields and its hilbert space .",
    "pseudo - spin collective variables represent all @xmath0 invariant variables of the theory ( both commuting and non - commuting ) .",
    "these close a compact algebra and at large @xmath2 are constrained by the corresponding casimir operator .",
    "one therefore has an algebraic pseudo - spin system whose nonlinearity is governed by the coupling constant @xmath115 . as such they have been employed earlier for developing a large @xmath2 expansion @xcite and as a model for quantization @xcite .",
    "this version of the theory is in its perturbative ( @xmath10 ) expansion identical to the bi - local collective representation .",
    "it therefore has the same map to and correspondence with higher spin ds@xmath5 at perturbative level .",
    "we will see however that the geometric representation becomes of use for defining ( and evaluating ) the hilbert space and its quantization .    to describe the pseudo - spin description of the @xmath0 theory",

    "the form of the casimir , which commutes with the above pseudo - spin fields points to the compact nature of the bi - local pseudo - spin algebra associated with the @xmath0 theory .",
    "this will have major consequences which we will highlight later .",
    "indeed it is interesting to compare the algebra with the bosonic case , where we have : @xmath130 with the commutation relations : @xmath126=&&{1\\over 2}\\left ( \\delta_{\\vec{p}_2,\\vec{p}_3}\\delta_{\\vec{p}_4,\\vec{p}_1}+\\delta_{\\vec{p}_2,\\vec{p}_4}\\delta_{\\vec{p}_3,\\vec{p}_1}\\right ) + { 1\\over { 4n}}\\left[\\delta_{\\vec{p}_2,\\vec{p}_3}b(\\vec{p}_4,\\vec{p}_1)+\\delta_{\\vec{p}_2,\\vec{p}_4}b(\\vec{p}_3,\\vec{p}_1)\\right.\\cr & & + \\left . \\delta_{\\vec{p}_1,\\vec{p}_3}b(\\vec{p}_4,\\vec{p}_2)+",

    "this signifies the compact versus the non - compact nature of the algebra , but also exhibits the relationship obtained through the @xmath134 switch that was central in the argument for de sitter correspondence in @xcite .    from this algebraic bi - local formulation",
    "one can easily see the the collective field representation(s ) that we have discussed in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "very simply , the casimir constraints can be solved , and the algebra implemented in terms of a canonical pair of bi - local fields : @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",

    "these operators create singlet states in the hilbert space and the difference contained in the sign of gamma implies the opposite shifts for the background fields that we have identified in sec .",
    "the algebraic pseudo spin reformulation is therefore seen to account for all the perturbative ( @xmath10 ) features of the the bi - local theory that we have identified in sec .",

    "the bi - local pseudo - spin algebra has several equivalent representations that turn out to be useful . beside that collective representation",
    "that we have explained above , one has the simple oscillator representation : @xmath139 with standard canonical canonical commutators ( or poisson brackets ) .",
    "a more relevant geometric representation is obtained through a change : @xmath140    the pseudo - spins in the @xmath141 representation are given by : @xmath142    it s easy to see that this satisfy the casimir constraint : @xmath143    one can write the lagrangian in this @xmath141 representation as : @xmath144-\\text{$\\mathcal{h}$}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for regularization purposes , it is useful to consider putting @xmath145 in a box and limiting the momenta by a cutoff @xmath146 : this makes the bi - local fields into finite dimensional matrices ( which we will take to be a size @xmath110 ) . for @xmath0",

    "we note that the standard fermionic problem which was considered in detail in @xcite corresponds to manifold @xmath150 of complex antisymmetric matrices .",
    "quantization on kahler manifolds in general has been formulated in detail by berezin @xcite .",
    "we also note that the usefullnes of kahler quantization for discretizing de sitter space was pointed out by a. volovich in a quantum mechanical scenario@xcite . in the present quantization we are dealing with a field theory with infinitely many degrees of freedom and infinite khaler matrix variables .",
    "we will now summarize some of the results of quantization which are directly relevant to the @xmath0 bi - local collective fields theory .",
    "commutation relations of this system follow from the poisson brackets associated with the lagrangian @xmath151 .",

    "the following results on quantization of this type of kahler system are of note : first , the parameter @xmath2 : much like for ordinary spin , one can show that @xmath2 ( and therefore @xmath160 in higher spin theory ) can only take integer values , i.e. @xmath161 .",
    "next , one has question about the total number of states in the above hilbert space .",
    "naively , bi - local theory would seem to grossly overcount the number of states of the original fermionic theory .",
    "originally one essentially had @xmath162 fermionic degrees of freedom with a finite hilbert space .",
    "the bi - local description is based on ( complex ) bosonic variables of dimensions @xmath112 and the corresponding hilbert space would appear to be much larger .",
    "but due to the compact nature of the phase space , the number of states much smaller .    we will now evaluate this number ( at finite @xmath2 and @xmath110 ) for the present case of @xmath0 ( in @xcite ordinary fermions were studied ) and show that the exact dimension of the bi - local hilbert space in geometric ( kahler ) quantization agrees with the dimension of the singlet hilbert space of the @xmath0 fermionic theory .",
    "the dimension of quantized hilbert space is found as follows : considering the operator @xmath163 one has that : @xmath164^{-2k}\\ ] ] consequently the dimension of the bi - local hilbert space is given by : @xmath165    the evaluation of the matrix ( penner ) integral therefore also determines the dimension of the bi - local hilbert space .",
    "since this evaluation is a little bit involved , we present it in the following .",
    "evaluation of matrix integrals ( for real matrices ) is given in @xcite the extension to the complex case was considered in@xcite .",
    "we will use results of @xcite , whereby every ( complex ) matrix can be reduced through ( symmetry ) transformations to a diagonal form : @xmath166    and the matrix integration measure becomes : @xmath167=\\vert \\delta(\\omega ) \\vert^2 \\prod_{l=1}^k d\\omega_l d\\omega\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath168 denotes  angular \" parts of the integration and @xmath169 is a vandermonde determinant , with @xmath170 .",
    "consequently the matrix integral for @xmath171 ( and @xmath159 ) becomes :    @xmath172    changing variables : @xmath173 , we get : @xmath174    this integral can be evaluated exactly .",
    "it belongs to a class of integrals evaluated by selberg in 1944 @xcite : @xmath175    we have the case with @xmath176 and @xmath177    we therefore obtain the following formula for the number of states in our bi - local @xmath0 hilbert space :    @xmath178    we have compared this number with explicit enumeration of @xmath0 invariant states in the fermionic hilbert space ( for low values of @xmath2 and @xmath110 ) and found complete agreement .",
    "it is probably not that difficult to prove agreement for all @xmath179 .",
    "this settles however the potential problem of overcompletness of the bi - local representation .",
    "since the @xmath0 counting uses the fermionic nature of creation operators and features exclusion when occupation numbers grow above certain limit it is seen that bi - local geometric quantization elegantly incorporates these effects .",
    "the compact nature of the associated infinite dimensional kahler manifold secures the correct dimensionality of the the singlet hilbert space . by using stirling s approximation for the number of states in the bi - local hilbert space",
    ", we see the dimension growing linearly in @xmath2 ( with @xmath180 ) : @xmath181 this is a clear demonstration of the presence of an @xmath2-dependent cutoff in agreement with the fermionic nature of the original @xmath0 hilbert space .",
    "so in the nonlinear bi - local theory with @xmath115 as coupling constant , we have the desired effect that the hilbert space is cutoff through @xmath182 effects .",
    "consequently we conclude that the geometric bi - local representation with infinite dimensional matrices @xmath183 provides a complete framework for quantization of the bi - local theory and of de sitter hs gravity .",
    "we have motivated the use of double analytic continuation and hence the connection between the @xmath0 model and de sitter higher field theory for the quadratic action for the collective field . to establish this connection one",
    "of course needs to establish this for the interaction terms .",
    "this is of course highly nontrivial , and in fact the connection between the collective theory for the @xmath1 model and the ads higher spin theory is only beginning to be understood .",
    "we believe that once this is understood well enough one can address the question for the @xmath0-ds connection .",
    "in this paper we have dealt mostly with the _ free _ @xmath0 vector model . as the parallel @xmath1/ads case this theory is characterized with an infinite sequence of conserved higher spin currents and associated conserved charges .",
    "the question regarding the implementation of the coleman - mandula theorem then arises , this question was discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "one can expected that identical conclusions hold for the present @xmath0 case .",
    "the bi - local collective field theory technqiue is trivially extendible to the linear sigma model based on @xmath0 , as commented in section ( 4.2 ) .",
    "of particular interest is the ir behavior of the theory which presumably takes the theory from the gaussian fixed point to a nontrivial fixed point .",
    "it is well known that ds / cft correspondence is quite different from ads / cft correspondence , particularly in the interpretation of bulk correlation functions @xcite .",
    "we have not addressed these issues in this paper .",
    "recently it has been proposed that the @xmath0/ds connection can be used to understand subtle points about ds / cft @xcite .",
    "we hope that an explicit construction as described in this paper will be valuable for a deeper understanding of these issues .    the bi - local formulation that we have presented was cast in a geometric , pseudo - spin framework .",
    "we have suggested that this representation offers the best framework for quantization of the bi - local theory and consequently the hilbert space in ds / cft .",
    "we have demonstrated through counting of the size of the hilbert space that it incorporates finite @xmath2 effects through a cutoff which depends on the coupling constant of the theory : @xmath115 .",
    "most importantly it incorporates the finite @xmath2 exclusion principle and provides an explanation on the quantization of @xmath115 from the bulk point of view .",
    "these features are obviously of definite relevance for understanding quantization of gravity in de sitter space - time .",
    "nevertheless the question of understanding de sitter entropy from this 3 dimensional cft remains an interesting and challenging problem .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the analogues of @xmath0/ds correspondence in the cft@xmath184/chern - simons version@xcite , as well as to three dimensional conformal theories which have a line of fixed points , as in @xcite .",
    "finally higher spin theories arise as limits of string theory in several contexts , e.g. @xcite and @xcite",
