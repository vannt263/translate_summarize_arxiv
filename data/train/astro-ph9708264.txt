    "the existence of a temperature - dependent upper - luminosity limit for massive stars was first pointed out by hutchings ( 1976 ) from observations of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and subsequently quantified by humphreys & davidson ( 1979 ) .",
    "the essence of this limit , often referred to as the `` hd - limit , '' is that the maximum luminosity observed for o - type stars is considerably higher than that seen for the most luminous m - supergiants .",
    "this observation has had a profound impact on our understanding of the evolution of massive stars , indicating that stars with initial masses greater than @xmath240 @xmath3 spend their lives in the blue part of the hr diagram without becoming red supergiants .",
    "evolution models for massive stars can be made to reproduce the observed hr diagram if sufficiently high stellar mass loss rates are assumed near the hd - limit ( e.g. , see schaller  et  al .  1992 ) .",
    "high mass loss leads to the removal of the h - rich stellar envelopes , halts redward evolution , and ultimately produces wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the presence near the observed hd - limit of the luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) , with their occasional outbursts and extreme mass ejections , seems to verify that mass loss  perhaps violent and episodic  is indeed the primary agent for shaping the properties of the upper hr diagram ( see humphreys & davidson 1994 for a detailed review of the lbvs ) .",
    "one of the most fundamental unanswered questions regarding the evolution of massive stars is the nature of the underlying instability mechanism which induces mass loss rates high enough to produce the outbursts observed in the lbvs and to carve the hd - limit into the hr diagram .",
    "one of the first suggestions was that stars become unstable near the hd - limit due to radiation pressure ( humphreys & davidson 1984 ; lamers 1986 ; appenzeller 1986 ) .",
    "this model holds that as massive stars ( @xmath4 ) evolve away from the zero age main sequence their photospheres become decreasingly stable against radiation pressure and ultimately reach a critical point where the radiation pressure and gravity are balanced , leading to large mass loss and ending the redward evolution .",
    "because of metal line opacity , the luminosity at which a stellar photosphere becomes unstable is much lower than that predicted by the classical electron - scattering eddington limit .",
    "quantitative studies of a `` modified eddington limit '' were performed by lamers & fitzpatrick ( 1988 , hereafter lf ) using low gravity , line - blanketed , plane - parallel , lte model atmosphere calculations . by extrapolating from the low gravity models to a point at which radiation pressure balanced gravitational pressure , they determined that the modified eddington limit was in reasonable agreement with the observed upper luminosity limit for hot stars ( @xmath5  k ) in the lmc .",
    "lamers & noordhoek ( 1993 , hereafter ln ) extended this work to examine the metallicity dependence of the modified eddington limit ; achmad , de  jager , and nieuwenhuijzen ( 1993 ) found that cool supergiants ( @xmath6  k ) are observationally excluded from the region of luminosity / temperature space predicted to be unstable from the modified eddington limit approach ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternate explanations for the hd - limit include instabilities of radial modes in massive stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; turbulent pressure ( e.g. , de jager 1984 ) ; and binary star models ( e.g. , kenyon & gallagher 1985 ) .",
    "humphreys & davidson ( 1994 ) critically review all these proposed instability mechanisms and conclude that none , at least in the current state of development , is fully satisfactory .",
    "it is important to understand the nature of the mass loss and instability mechanisms operating in the upper hr diagram  not only to complete the theoretical picture of stellar evolution , but also to aid in the interpretation of observations of massive stars .",
    "perhaps the most obvious application of such an understanding would be to determine whether the brightest stars can be used as reliable distance indicators ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we revisit the modified eddington limit scenario proposed by lamers and collaborators .",
    "we utilize up - to - date stellar atmosphere calculations to evaluate the radiation pressure stability of low surface gravity stars and the most recent stellar evolution calculations to transform the stellar atmosphere parameters ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) to the hr diagram ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the model atmosphere calculations and the transformation to the hr diagram are described in ",
    "[ lowgsec ] . in",
    "  [ comobssec ] , the modified eddington limit is compared with the observed upper hr diagram of the lmc .",
    "concluding remarks are given in ",
    "[ concomsec ] .",
    "as in lf , our basic procedure is to compute line - blanketed , plane - parallel , lte stellar photosphere models for many @xmath7 s corresponding to ob stars .",
    "we compute the models at each temperature , for surface gravities ranging from those appropriate for the main sequence ( @xmath8 @xmath10 4.0 ) down to the lowest values for which a model in hydrostatic equilibrium can be computed .",
    "we then determine the luminosity , @xmath9 , corresponding to each model atmosphere from stellar evolution calculations and thus can place the atmosphere models on the hr diagram ( @xmath9 vs. @xmath7 ) and compare with observations .    for calculating stellar atmospheres",
    ", we employ the atlas9 model atmosphere code of kurucz ( 1995 ) , kindly provided by r.l .",
    "the opacity distribution functions ( odf s ) needed to compute the models were obtained from the ccp7 library ( jeffery 1990 ) .",
    "we produced grids of models for four different metallicities , @xmath11 = 2.0 , 1.0 , 0.3 , and 0.1 ( appropriate for m31 , the milky way , lmc , and smc ) using the odf s corresponding to a microturbulence velocity of @xmath12 km s@xmath13 . in a study of the energy distributions of early - type stars using low - dispersion @xmath14 data , fitzpatrick & massa ( in progress ) find that such large values of @xmath15 are required to reproduce the observed uv opacity in o stars and high - luminosity b stars .",
    "it is likely that the large equivalent widths of the strong stellar `` photospheric '' absorption features , which require the high values of @xmath15 to reproduce , are actually caused by a physical mechanism very different from microturbulence , namely , systematic velocity gradients due to increasingly deep penetration of the stellar wind into the photosphere ( e.g. , massa , shore , & wynne 1992 ) . nevertheless , the important point for this investigation is that the @xmath16 km s@xmath13 models represent the _ observed opacities _ remarkably well .    in all",
    ", we computed several thousand low gravity models ( which are available on request ) at 35 different values of @xmath7 between 10,000 k and 50,000 k. we characterize each atmosphere with the parameter @xmath17  suggested by humphreys & davidson ( 1994 )  which is the maximum value of the ratio of the outward radiative force to the inward newtonian gravitational force found within the optical depth range @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "a value of @xmath20 , which defines the modified eddington limit , corresponds to the case where the radiative and gravitational forces are equal .    a model in hydrostatic equilibrium can not be computed for @xmath20 , nor can models be found arbitrarily close to this value . for most models",
    ", @xmath0 is obtained at optical depths of @xmath21 115 . however ,",
    "close to the modified eddington limit the region with highest radiative acceleration generally shifts to the surface , at @xmath22 , and this constrains the lowest surface gravity for which a hydrostatic model can be computed . as noted by lf and ln , this is not considered to represent the modified eddington limit because the densities at these surface points are so low that even an atmosphere which is not in hydrostatic equilibrium at the surface would add essentially nothing to the mass loss and because the tops of the photospheres of normal `` stable '' ob stars merge with the stellar winds and are not in hydrostatic equilibrium . both lf and ln extrapolated to estimate the value of @xmath23 corresponding to the hypothetical case where @xmath20 ( see fig . 3 in lf ) from models ,",
    "in which @xmath0 was determined at @xmath24 . in this paper , we restrict our attention to values of @xmath0 less than 0.95 ; extrapolations are required only in a small number cases and will be noted where appropriate .    figure  [ ggedd ] demonstrates how the surface gravity , @xmath23 , of models approaching the modified eddington limit compare to those at the classical electron - scattering eddington limit , defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean atomic weight per electron .",
    "the two panels show the ratio of the surface gravities over a range of effective temperatures for two different metallicities and four representative values of @xmath0 ( 0.95 , 0.90 , 0.75 , and 0.50 ) . at all metallicities ,",
    "the highest temperature models come closest to @xmath27 since their atmospheric opacity is dominated by electron scattering . at lower temperatures ,",
    "metal line - blanketing in the uv becomes increasingly important and the classical and modified limits diverge .",
    "the rise in @xmath28 below about 11,000 k is likely caused by the shifting of the emergent energy distributions out of the uv and into the relatively unblanketed optical region .",
    "as expected , the modified eddington limit comes closest to the electron scattering limit in the lowest metallicity models .",
    "modest extrapolation is required outside the range , @xmath29k to reach @xmath30 .",
    "the extrapolation is largest for models with @xmath31  k and solar metallicity .    to determine the luminosities corresponding to our atmosphere models",
    ", we use the stellar evolution grids published by schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 , for @xmath11 = 1.0 and 0.05 ) , schaerer et al .",
    "( 1993a , for @xmath11 = 0.4 ) , schaerer et al .",
    "( 1993b , for @xmath11 = 2.0 ) , and charbonnel et al .",
    "( 1993 ; for @xmath11 = 0.2 ) .",
    "these models were computed with the most recent updates of the relevant physical parameters ( e.g. , opacities ) , include the effect of mass loss by winds , and were tabulated explicitly for ease of interpolation within and between the grids . for simplicity ,",
    "both lf and ln used a mass - luminosity relation based on the end of the core hydrogen burning evolutionary phase ( chb ) to map the atmosphere models onto the hr diagram .",
    "ln noted that many of the models considered actually corresponded to stars still in the chb phase , and that this procedure limits the ability to make quantitative comparisons with observations .",
    "we take a different approach here and interpolate within a grid of stellar evolution calculations ( of the appropriate metallicity ) to find the initial masses of all models which pass through a given set of @xmath7 and @xmath8 values , as well as the stellar luminosity at the desired @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this way",
    "we achieve an essentially exact mapping of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 values onto the hr diagram without simplifying assumptions .",
    "figure  [ soltracks ] shows the results of this mapping onto the @xmath32 vs. @xmath33 diagram for the calculations done with solar metallicity for representative values of @xmath34 = 0.95 , 0.90 , 0.75 , and 0.50 .",
    "figure  [ soltracks ] yields two important results .",
    "first , the shape of the curves with @xmath0 values less than 1 are very similar to each other and to that derived by ln for the extrapolated case of @xmath0 = 1.0 .",
    "this characteristic shape , dubbed the `` eddington trough '' by ln , is thus not unique to the hypothetical point of radiative instability , but rather represents the locus of constant @xmath0 values .",
    "second , during the chb phase the atmospheres of massive stars evolve in the direction of increasing @xmath0 , i.e. , towards decreased stability against radiation pressure .",
    "these points will be discussed further in the following section , where the modified eddington limit is compared with observations .",
    "studies of the upper hr diagram have often focused on the lmc for well - known observational reasons , including the uniform and well - determined distance of the stars , the low line - of - sight reddening , and the nearly complete census of the most luminous stars . in figure",
    "[ lmcfig ] , we reproduce the lmc hr diagram published by fitzpatrick & garmany ( 1990 ; small filled circles ) .",
    "two changes have been made for this paper .",
    "first we adjusted the values of @xmath35 to reflect the currently favored lmc distance modulus of 18.6 mag ( e.g. , whitelock , van  leeuwen , & feast 1997 ) .",
    "second , we added data for about 80 o stars near the 30 doradus region from a recent paper by walborn and blades ( 1997 ) .",
    "the various features of the lmc hr diagram , and the details of its construction , are discussed by fitzpatrick & garmany . for our purposes here , the important aspect is that there are many stars more luminous than @xmath36  k while there are few , if any , for @xmath37  k ( including the m supergiants , which are not shown ) , i.e. , the temperature - dependent hd - limit .    in figure 3",
    "we also show the results of the stellar atmosphere calculations for @xmath0 = 1 , 0.90 , 0.75 , and 0.50 .",
    "these were computed for @xmath38 , appropriate for the lmc , and converted to the hr diagram using a grid of stellar evolution models interpolated between the schaerer et al .",
    "( 1993a , @xmath11 = 0.4 ) and charbonnel et al .",
    "( 1993 ; @xmath11 = 0.2 ) grids .",
    "the luminosity at @xmath20 was estimated only for temperatures in the range 13,00018,000 k , for which stable models could be computed out to @xmath39 .",
    "the extrapolation to the modified eddington limit ( @xmath20 ) is thus relatively secure in this region .",
    "the temperature dependence of the modified eddington limit outside these temperatures may be inferred from the shapes of the other curves .",
    "figure 3 shows that the bottom of the trough of the modified eddington limit ( @xmath40 @xmath41 ) is about one magnitude more luminous than the brightest lmc stars with @xmath37k .",
    "this result is actually quite similar to those found by lf and ln ; however in those papers , known deficiencies in the model atmosphere opacities ( lf ) and inadequate transformations to the hr diagram ( lf and ln ) obscured the significance of the discrepancy .",
    "thus , in contrast to previous assertions , we believe that figure 3 shows quite clearly that _ the modified eddington limit does not coincide with the observed upper luminosity limit for lmc stars . _",
    "rather , we suggest the observed limit is much better defined by the model atmospheres with @xmath42 , with their lowest luminosities at @xmath43 9.9 .",
    "we can estimate the metallicity dependence of the upper luminosity limit , as in ln , by comparing the luminosities of the @xmath0 = 0.90 models at various metallicities .",
    "figure 4 shows such a comparison for @xmath11 = 2.0 , 1.0 , 0.3 , and 0.1 , corresponding approximately to m31 , the milky way , lmc , and smc , respectively .",
    "the curves for the four metallicities have nearly identical shapes , `` the eddington trough , '' and differ only by simple displacements . from this comparison",
    "we might expect the luminosity limit for cool stars in the smc to be higher by 0.3 mag than the lmc , and those for the milky way and m31 to be lower by 0.4 and 0.75 mag , respectively .",
    "the relatively small expected difference between the lmc and smc is consistent with the lack of any obvious offset between the lmc and smc hr diagrams ( e.g. , garmany & fitzpatrick 1989 ) . despite the observational challenge in resolving individual stars in m31 ( cf .",
    "massey  et  al .  1995 ) , comparison of that galaxy with the lmc or smc offers the best hope for testing the predictive value of the @xmath1 curves .",
    "additionally , a strong metallicity gradient exists in m31 ( a factor of @xmath44 from the center to 20 kpc ; blair , kirshner , & chevalier 1981 , 1982 ) , so it may be possible to observe the variation of the upper - luminosity within the galaxy .",
    "for these purposes , the relevant indicator of the metallicity as discussed in this paper would be the fe / h ratio because , we believe , the important variation in opacity with metallicity is due primarily to iron peak elements which blanket the uv .",
    "in summary , we have determined the location of the modified eddington limit for stars in the lmc using the most recent atmosphere models combined with a precise mapping to the hr diagram through up - to - date stellar evolution calculations .",
    "we find that the modified eddington limit is actually _ a full magnitude higher _ than the upper luminosity limit observed for lmc stars .",
    "the observed limit is consistent with atmosphere models in which the maximum value of the ratio of the radiation force outwards to the gravitational force inwards , @xmath0 , is 0.9 ; i.e. , the photospheres of stars at the observed luminosity limit are bound .    with some caution",
    ", we thus suggest that the simple picture in which a massive star evolves redward until its photosphere reaches the modified eddington limit and becomes unbound is invalid .",
    "although the stars do evolve from the zero age main sequence in the direction of increasing @xmath0 , an instability evidently sets in _ before _ the atmospheres reach the formal modified eddington limit at @xmath45 .",
    "this conclusion is necessarily tentative since this analysis , like others before , relies on plane - parallel , hydrostatic atmosphere models , while the atmospheres of real stars near the observed luminosity limit are likely to share neither of these properties .",
    "it appears unlikely , however , to be a coincidence that the temperature dependence of the luminosity limit should so closely match that of the @xmath0 curves seen in figures 14 , whose shapes are nearly invariant to metallicity or to the precise value of @xmath0 itself .",
    "the degree of stability against radiation pressure of the photospheres clearly plays an important role in shaping the upper stellar luminosity limits , although the current characterization of that stability may leave something to be desired .",
    "the @xmath0 parameterization may well turn out to correlate with some more critical property , such as the depth of the `` boundary '' between a stellar wind and the underlying photosphere .",
    "a firm understanding of the upper luminosity limits and of the outbursts in lbvs will almost certainly require a melding of stellar wind , stellar photosphere , and stellar evolution calculations .",
    "fortunately , progress in this area is being made ( e.g. , @xcite , schaerer  et  al ."
