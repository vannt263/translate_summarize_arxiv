    "inclusive photoproduction of an isolated prompt photon has been measured at hera  @xcite and compared to theoretical predictions  @xcite recently .",
    "the photoproduction of an isolated prompt photon and a jet has been studied less extensively  @xcite , and only partial next - to - leading order codes were available up to now  @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of the jet allows the definition of observables which may provide a more detailed picture of the underlying partonic processes than in the inclusive case .",
    "in particular , it allows to extract information on the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the initial state partons .",
    "the introduction of an effective initial state transverse momentum @xmath3",
    "@xcite has become a common practice in recent years  @xcite and has served to bridge large gaps between certain data and nlo theory in fixed target and hadronic collision experiments of prompt photon production .",
    "it has been argued that , in addition to the `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum of the initial state partons of a few hundred mev due to the finite size of the proton , initial state soft gluon radiation can generate sizeable transverse components of the parton momenta .",
    "considerable progress has been made in recent times to account for multiple soft gluon emission effects in resummation formalisms  @xcite@xcite , but the phenomenological application of such calculations has not reached a mature state yet . therefore , simplified phenomenological models for @xmath4 effects have been employed which introduce a gaussian smearing of the parton transverse momenta , the mean value of this effective @xmath0 being fitted from data . however , these procedures are rather ad hoc , and various experiments lead to quite different conclusions  @xcite on the necessity to introduce an effective @xmath0 .",
    "recently , the zeus collaboration reported on the analysis of prompt photon plus jet photoproduction data  @xcite . from the comparison of the data",
    "to results obtained with the monte carlo program pythia  @xcite , it has been concluded in  @xcite that a total effective @xmath3 value of about 1.7gev is necessary to fit the data .",
    "this value is composed of the mean value of the intrinsic parton momentum in the proton , @xmath5 , and the parton shower contribution to @xmath3 .",
    "the two contributions are combined assuming that the overall distribution is gaussian .",
    "the parton shower contribution was found to be approximately 1.4gev , and for @xmath5 a value of @xmath6gev has been fitted .",
    "however , it was found that the same data are already well described by herwig  @xcite with a default parton intrinsic transverse momentum of zero .    in this paper , we compare nlo qcd results to the data presented in  @xcite and discuss in detail possible sources of differences between theory and data . in particular , we address the question whether an extra effective transverse momentum @xmath3  in addition to the one already contained in fixed order nlo qcd  is necessary to fit the zeus data .",
    "we found that our nlo qcd prediction for the quantities which served to determine @xmath3 in  @xcite describes the data without taking into account any extra @xmath0 effects .",
    "we recall that the same is true for a large set of prompt photon data in hadronic collisions and fixed target experiments  @xcite .",
    "our results have been obtained with a program of partonic event generator type which includes the full next - to - leading order corrections to all the partonic subprocesses , as well as the box contribution @xmath7 .",
    "the program already has been used to study inclusive prompt photon photoproduction  @xcite , and has been extended to allow also the calculation of prompt photon plus jet photoproduction in the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we first describe the main lines of the calculation our code is based on .",
    "then we discuss the effect of certain kinematic cuts and infrared sensitive limits which will be relevant for the comparison to the zeus data . in section 3",
    "we give numerical results for the isolated photon plus jet cross section and compare to zeus data .",
    "section 4 contains the study of @xmath0-sensitive observables .",
    "we show our results for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions used by zeus to determine @xmath3 and discuss their implications .",
    "an appendix contains details of the discussion of symmetric cuts contained in section 2 .",
    "as the general framework of the calculation already has been described in detail in  @xcite , we will give only a brief overview on the method here .",
    "in photoproduction events , the electron acts like a source of quasi - real photons whose spectrum can be described by the weizscker - williams formula @xmath10 the quasi - real photon then either takes part _ directly _ in the hard scattering process , or it acts as a composite object , being a source of partons which take part in the hard subprocess .",
    "the latter mechanism is referred to as _ resolved _ process and is parametrized by the photon structure functions @xmath11 .",
    "thus the distribution of partons in the electron is a convolution @xmath12 where in the `` direct '' case @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , a high-@xmath14 photon in the final state can either originate directly from the hard scattering process or it can be produced by the fragmentation of a hard parton emerging from the hard scattering process . thus we distinguish four categories of production mechanisms , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] : 1.direct direct 2.direct fragmentation 3.resolved direct 4.resolved fragmentation .",
    "we implemented the full set of next - to - leading order corrections to all four subprocesses .",
    "note that the photon structure functions behave for large @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "an analogous argument holds for the fragmentation functions , such that a consistent nlo calculation requires the inclusion of the full @xmath17 corrections not only to the `` direct direct '' part but also to the resolved and/or fragmentation parts .",
    "the matrix elements for these nlo corrections have been taken from the literature  @xcite .",
    "we also included the box contribution @xmath18 , which is formally nnlo , but known to be sizeable  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0algorithm  @xcite has been employed , as has been done by the zeus collaboration .    to single out the prompt photon events from the background of secondary photons produced by the decays of light mesons , isolation cuts have to be imposed on the photon signals in the experiment .",
    "we use the following isolation criterion : in a cone @xmath19 centered around the photon direction in the rapidity and azimuthal angle plane , defined by @xmath20 the amount of deposited hadronic transverse energy @xmath21 is required to be smaller than a fraction @xmath22 of the photon transverse momentum .",
    "we use @xmath23 and @xmath24 = 1 to match the cuts of the zeus collaboration .",
    "since isolation cuts impose additional phase space restrictions , the question has been raised if factorization properties valid for the inclusive case might be spoiled by isolation .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "here we just note that the above criterion , being based on boost - invariant _ transverse _ energies , leads to infrared safe cross sections .      as a consequence of phase space restrictions induced for example by kinematic cuts , certain observables calculated at fixed order",
    "may show instabilities ( integrable singularities ) at some critical point of phase space  @xcite .",
    "examples will be discussed below .      in order to restrict both prompt photons and jets to well - measured kinematic regions ,",
    "the zeus collaboration has required @xmath26gev and @xmath27gev in their analysis  @xcite . however , as it is well known  @xcite , symmetric cuts on the transverse energies should be avoided since they select a region where fixed order nlo qcd loses its predictive power .",
    "this can be seen by considering the total cross section as a function of @xmath28 as shown in fig.[etcut ] .",
    "the cut on the transverse energy of the photon has been fixed to @xmath29gev .",
    "the figure shows that the nlo qcd prediction varies rapidly around the point @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , it is striking that the cross section is _ not _ immediately monotonically decreasing for increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the reason for the dip at @xmath30 is that at this point the phase space for the unobserved parton in the real corrections is severely restricted , such that the ( negative ) virtual corrections are not sufficiently balanced by the ( positive ) real corrections . as a result",
    "we observe a violation of unitarity in the range 5.0gev@xmath31gev , where the cross section increases when the available phase space decreases . this phenomenon ,",
    "that we discuss in detail in the appendix , is an artifact of the fixed order calculation . in this particular region around @xmath30 , the higher order corrections should be resummed to produce a curve that should look like the dashed curve in fig.[etcut ] .",
    "this resummation is not considered in this paper ( but the large logarithms responsible for this behaviour are identified ,",
    "see appendix a ) because the unphysical effect at @xmath30 is in general numerically weak .",
    "however , we shall explore the effect of different choices of @xmath28 when calculating the cross section corresponding to zeus data .",
    "it is clear that an asymmetric cut in the experiment would avoid any trouble .",
    "care also has to be taken in the treatment of the variable @xmath32 near the boundary @xmath33 . at leading order ,",
    "the fraction @xmath32 of the incoming photon longitudinal momentum is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the rapidities of the two outgoing partons and @xmath37 . at next - to - leading order , the `` true '' @xmath32 for 2 @xmath38 3 processes",
    "is given by @xmath39 , but since particle 5 is not observed , @xmath32 is no longer an experimentally accessible observable .",
    "hence , to obtain an estimate of the longitudinal momentum fraction of the incoming photon , the variable @xmath40 , defined as @xmath41 is frequently used .",
    "however , the above definition of @xmath40 may lead to infrared sensitive cross sections  @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath42 _ and _ @xmath43 strongly constrains the phase space of parton 5 when @xmath40 goes to one .",
    "this is reflected by @xmath44 terms generated by the higher order corrections . in general , @xmath40 is integrated over , typically in the range @xmath45 , such that the singular behaviour is sufficiently smoothed out for a fixed order calculation to remain valid .",
    "however , if the width of the last bin at @xmath46 is small , the shape of the theoretical prediction near @xmath47 is considerably dependent on the bin width . for this reason , the variable @xmath48 , which has a smoother behavior for @xmath33 , has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it also has the advantage that it does not depend on @xmath43 and thus does not contain an uncertainty from the jet energy reconstruction . note",
    "that @xmath49 can be bigger than one , as illustrated in fig.[xll ] .    for the analysis presented in  @xcite , the zeus collaboration did not use @xmath40 , but the variable @xmath50 , defined as @xmath51 where the sum is over the prompt photon and the contents of the jet , and @xmath52 is the energy fraction of the incoming photon , reconstructed with the jacquet - blondel method : @xmath53 here the sum is over all energy - flow objects in the event , each of which is treated as due to a massless particle with energy @xmath54 and longitudinal momentum component @xmath55 . from an experimental point of view , @xmath50 is convenient since a lot of calorimeter calibration systematics cancel out .",
    "the difference between definitions ( [ xobsth ] ) and ( [ xmeas ] ) for @xmath32 depends on the definitions of @xmath43 and @xmath56 in ( [ xobsth ] ) .",
    "if the snowmass conventions @xmath57 are used , one has @xmath58 for our analysis , where maximally two massless partons form a jet , the difference between @xmath40 and @xmath50 is numerically indistinguishable ( see fig.[xll ] ) .",
    "obviously , what has been said above on the limit @xmath46 is valid for @xmath59 as well .",
    "for the numerical studies we use the rapidity cuts @xmath60 and @xmath61 chosen by zeus to restrict the photon and the jet to well measured kinematic regions .",
    "we also use the cuts @xmath62gev in order to match the zeus cuts , although such symmetric cuts select a region where fixed order perturbative qcd shows instabilities , as discussed in detail in section [ cut ] and in the appendix . from fig .",
    "[ etcut ] one can estimate that the uncertainty in the theoretical prediction introduced by using these cuts is of the order of 6 - 10% for the total cross section .",
    "we set @xmath63gev@xmath64 for the virtuality of the photons in ( [ ww ] ) and restrict the photon energy to the range @xmath65 as reconstructed by zeus .",
    "we take the mrst2  @xcite parametrization for the parton distributions in the proton , afg  @xcite for the parton distributions in the photon , bfg  @xcite for the fragmentation functions into photons , @xmath66 flavors , and for @xmath67 we use an exact solution of the two - loop renormalization group equation , and not an expansion in log@xmath68 . unless stated otherwise , the scale choice @xmath69 has been adopted and @xmath70 and @xmath71 have been set equal to @xmath72 .",
    "the rapidities refer to the @xmath73 laboratory frame , with the hera convention that the proton is moving towards positive rapidity .",
    "fig.[bornnlo ] shows the relative magnitude of the nlo result to the leading order result for the isolated photon rapidity distribution .",
    "as the box contribution has the same kinematics as the leading order direct direct part , we included the box contribution in this part , such that `` direct direct '' always means direct direct plus box .",
    "since the higher order corrections to the direct direct term are negative and those to the resolved part are small ( for the scale choice @xmath69 , see fig.[bornnlosep ] ) , the overall nlo result is lower than the leading order result .",
    "we note that the higher order corrections to the direct part are most negative for @xmath74 , for asymmetric cuts the absolute value of the negative contributions decreases .    in order to single out the events stemming from a direct photon in the initial state , the cut @xmath75 has been applied by zeus .",
    "however , it has to be kept in mind that beyond leading order , the direct part has a non - negligible tail away from @xmath76 , and that the contributions from the resolved part to the bin @xmath75 are rather large , as can be seen from fig.[dirxcut](a ) .",
    "fig.[dirxcut](b ) compares the sum direct + resolved with the cut @xmath77 to direct direct only with no cut on @xmath50 for the photon rapidity distribution .",
    "one observes that there is a significant difference in the shape between the direct part and the result obtained by imposing the cut @xmath75 to the full set of subprocesses , the latter being higher in the backward region and lower in the forward region . hence imposing a stringent cut on @xmath50",
    "can not be considered as fully equivalent to singling out the direct events only .",
    "fig.[xgaobs ] shows the distributions @xmath78 and the photon rapidity distribution for various scale choices together with the zeus data .",
    "one can see that the theoretical uncertainty due to overall scale variations , i.e. varying @xmath72 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 and setting @xmath81 , is very small . for the distribution in @xmath50",
    "one observes that theory overshoots the data substantially in the last bin , whereas the data are described well in the remaining bins . in @xmath82",
    "there is a rather large discrepancy between theory and data in the forward region .",
    "reasons for these discrepancies may be the following :    1 .",
    "the data are at the detector level , i.e. they are not fully corrected for energy losses in the detector and other effects .",
    "therefore data corrected to the hadron level may differ in a non - negligible way from the ones displayed in fig[xgaobs ]",
    ". moreover our calculations are performed at the parton level and hadronization effects may also lead to sizeable corrections at these low values of @xmath83 ( see also point 4 .",
    "2 .   there is an uncertainty in the reconstruction of the `` true '' photon energy @xmath84 with the jacquet - blondel method ( cf .",
    "( [ yjb ] ) ) . in general ,",
    "corrections for detector effects and energy calibration tend to shift the range of @xmath84 to slightly higher values as compared to the original range of @xmath52 .",
    "to study the effect of an uncertainty in @xmath84 , we varied the cuts on @xmath84 , increasing the lower cut from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , respectively increasing the upper cut from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , as shown in fig.[ymin ] .",
    "3 .   concerning @xmath78 : + there is an uncertainty in the energy and @xmath55 values entering in the definition ( [ xmeas ] ) of @xmath50 . taking into account this uncertainty in the calculation would introduce a gaussian smearing in @xmath54 and @xmath55 which would smooth out the theoretical curve near @xmath59 .",
    "as already discussed in  @xcite , a non - negligible part of the hadronic energy measured in the isolation cone may be due to underlying events , especially in the forward region .",
    "therefore it is possible that experimentally , the isolation cut removes events which pass in the theoretical ( parton level ) simulation since there the underlying event contamination is not present .",
    "it has been estimated  @xcite that this can have an effect of the order of 30% in the forward region .",
    "fig.[jetmin ] again demonstrates ( see also fig.[etcut ] ) that the cross section is very sensitive to a variation of @xmath28 around the value @xmath30 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that increasing the cut on @xmath43 from 5gev to 5.5gev does _ not _ lead to a decrease in the cross section , as explained in section [ cut ] . for the rapidity distribution the theoretical uncertainty introduced by",
    "using symmetric cuts can be as large as 30% .",
    "an intrinsic @xmath3 would not improve the agreement between theory and data for the photon rapidity distribution , since it would shift the theoretical curve upwards without changing its shape .",
    "we note also that the data for @xmath82 and @xmath78 are in general well described by pythia 6.129 with default @xmath3 values  @xcite . only in the backward region in the photon rapidity distribution , pythia is lower than the data , the same trend is visible in the nlo theory curve .",
    "figure [ scaledep ] shows the contributions from direct and resolved initial state photons separately .",
    "as the those parts separately are highly scale dependent , results for two ( `` extreme '' ) scale choices are shown .",
    "the figure for the rapidity distribution illustrates that the statement which part  i.e. resolved or direct part  dominates in the forward region ,",
    "is scale dependent .",
    "in this section we compare our results with the zeus data for the @xmath0 - sensitive observables @xmath8 and @xmath9 which served to determine @xmath3 in  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is the momentum component of the photon perpendicular to the jet direction , defined as @xmath89 here @xmath83 is _ not _ the snowmass @xmath43 , but the modulus of the transverse components of the vector sum of the particle momenta which form the jet .",
    "@xmath9 is the azimuthal acollinearity between the photon and the jet . to define @xmath9 , the snowmass definition ( see eq .",
    "( [ fisnow ] ) ) for the jet azimuthal angle has been used by zeus . in the experiment ,",
    "a cut of @xmath75 has been imposed in order to select events which are predominantly from direct incoming photons , thereby suppressing eventual contributions to @xmath3 from the resolved photon .",
    "the data for these quantities have been corrected to hadron level .",
    "as the value of @xmath3 affects mainly the shape of the distributions , the cross sections have been normalized to one in order to minimize uncertainties in the calorimeter energy scale .",
    "fig.[varyxcut ] shows the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions together with the zeus data .",
    "one can see that nlo qcd does describe the zeus data well without any intrinsic @xmath0 or resummation taken into account .",
    "a reason for the fact that no need for resummation near @xmath90 or @xmath91 is visible might be that the bin size is relatively large .",
    "since there is an uncertainty in the reconstruction of @xmath50 , we investigated the effect of shifting the cut on @xmath50 , as illustrated in fig.[varyxcut ] .",
    "the reason why the result for the last bin @xmath92 respectively @xmath93 decreases if the lower cut on @xmath94 is decreased is related to the fact that for @xmath95 more inelastic processes contribute than for @xmath96 , such that the ratio of nearly back - to - back events to the full cross section decreases .    note that we used symmetric cuts @xmath97gev in order to match the zeus cuts .",
    "as discussed above , the theoretical result shows instabilities for symmetric cut values .",
    "therefore we investigated the effect of varying @xmath28 by 10% around the critical point @xmath29gev , as shown in fig.[etmin ] .",
    "one can see that the result varies by less than 10% in the normalized cross sections .",
    "the effect of an uncertainty in the cuts on the photon energy @xmath84 has been found to be negligible in the area normalized plots .    hence we can say that the agreement between fixed order nlo qcd and data is very good in the case studied here .",
    "no @xmath0 in addition to the one already implicitly accounted for by including the full set of nlo corrections is needed .",
    "we recall that he same was true for the inclusive case  @xcite , but of course there the sensitivity to @xmath0 is smaller .",
    "further we note that the _ intrinsic _ @xmath0 ( i.e. the component of @xmath3 that does not include the parton shower contribution ) determined by the zeus collaboration to fit best the data has been obtained by comparing to simulations with pythia 6.129 . on the other hand , it was also found that the data are already well described by herwig 6.1 with the default parton @xmath5 of zero  @xcite .",
    "the reason might stem from differences in the way the parton showering is implemented in herwig and pythia .",
    "herwig does not use a sharp lower cut - off in the shower evolution below which pythia relies on a suitable value of @xmath5 .",
    "we have presented a full next - to - leading order calculation for the photoproduction of an isolated photon accompanied by a jet , based on a program of partonic event generator type .",
    "we found that the variation of our result due to scale changes is very weak .",
    "we also investigated the sensitivity of the cross section to variations of the photon energy , to different cuts on @xmath32 and to the cut @xmath28 on the jet transverse energy .",
    "in particular , we discussed in detail the instabilities arising at fixed order nlo qcd if symmetric cuts on the photon and jet transverse energies are chosen .    in comparing the @xmath32 distribution to zeus data we found that the agreement is good except near @xmath33 . for the photon rapidity distribution we found that our prediction is below the data in the backward region and overpredicts the data in the forward region .",
    "we discussed in detail possible sources of discrepancies between theory and data .",
    "we also compared our results to recent zeus data for @xmath98 - sensitive observables .",
    "since the comparison has been done for normalized cross sections , the effect of variations in the photon energy , @xmath99 or @xmath28 turned out to be very small .",
    "we found that nlo qcd already describes these data well without introduction of any additional intrinsic @xmath0 .",
    "our results are in contrast to the results found in the e706 fixed target experiment  @xcite , where the conclusion was that high-@xmath14 prompt photon and @xmath100 data could not be well described by nlo perturbative qcd without the incorporation of substantial extra @xmath0 effects .    * acknowledgements *    we are grateful to p.  bussey from the zeus collaboration for helpful discussions .",

    "in this appendix we identify the origin of the pathological behaviour of the cross section in the vicinity of @xmath101 for symmetric cuts on the photon and jet transverse energies ( see fig.[etcut ] ) .",
    "our aim is to isolate only the leading behaviour , i.e. we work in the double logarithmic approximation and drop subleading contributions .",
    "we consider the subprocess @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the momentum of a gluon .",
    "this gluon represents a nlo correction to the born subprocess @xmath104 and in the soft approximation ( @xmath105 ) this nlo correction can be written as @xmath106 the cut @xmath107 in the approximation we consider here ) restricts the gluon phase space to values of @xmath108 smaller than @xmath109 and depending on @xmath110 : @xmath111 .",
    "for @xmath112 we obtain @xmath113 the @xmath114 term is cancelled by the virtual contribution .",
    "the @xmath110 integration is not straightforward because the constraint @xmath115 does not lead to a simple expression of @xmath116 , but when @xmath28 is close to @xmath109 we get @xmath117 when @xmath118 we obtain @xmath119 the cross section displayed in fig.[etcut ] is integrated over @xmath109 from a lower limit @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "therefore the soft nlo contribution to the cross section for @xmath122 is @xmath123 where we used the approximation @xmath124 .",
    "when @xmath28 increases up to @xmath120 , the negative contribution ( [ diverge ] ) to the cross section becomes more and more dominant and explains the behaviour of the cross section in the range @xmath125 .",
