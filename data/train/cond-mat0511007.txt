    "recently , it has been growing that the concern with elastic surface models of helfrich and polyakov - kleinert @xcite .",

    "curvature energies play a crucial role in smoothing the surface . according to curvature energies",
    ", surface models can be divided into two classes ; one with an extrinsic curvature and the other with an intrinsic curvature .",
    "it is also possible that both extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures are included in a model hamiltonian .",
    "intrinsic curvature is the one that is defined only by using the metric tensor ( first fundamental form ) of the surface , and extrinsic curvature is defined by using the extrinsic curvature tensor ( second fundamental form ) of the surface @xcite . both of the mean curvature @xmath0 and the gaussian curvature @xmath1 defined by using the extrinsic curvature tensor , are considered as an extrinsic curvature .",
    "however , the gaussian curvature can also be considered as an intrinsic curvature , because of the relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the scalar curvature defined only by using the metric tensor .",
    "intrinsic curvature models were first studied by baillie et .",

    "the shape of surfaces can be strongly influenced by intrinsic curvatures .",
    "recently several numerical studies have been made on the phase diagram of the model with intrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "it was reported that the model undergoes a first - order phase transition between the smooth phase and the crumpled phase on a sphere @xcite and on a disk @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the phase structure of the model has been partly clarified : the transition can be seen independent of whether the surface is compact or non - compact .",
    "however , the model is not yet sufficiently understood .",
    "remaining subject to be confirmed is whether the phase transition and the topology - change are _ compatible _ in the surface model on compact surfaces . here _",
    "compatible _ means that both of two phenomena lead to the same result without depending on which phenomenon firstly occurs .",
    "if we define the surface model on compact surfaces , it is reasonable to consider the topology - change of surfaces .",
    "in fact , the partition function for the closed string model of polyakov includes the summation over topology .",
    "moreover , a toroidal vesicle and a genus two vesicle with two holes can be observed in biological membranes @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting , even in the context of the tethered surfaces , to study whether the first - order transition can be observed on a torus , as one of the higher genus surfaces . the phase transition might be seen only on spherical surfaces , if the phase transition and the topology - change are incompatible .    in this letter , in order to confirm the compatibility we will show that a first - order transition can be seen in the model on a torus with intrinsic curvature and that the phase transition is identical to that observed in the model on a sphere reported in @xcite .",

    "the expression @xmath26 shows that @xmath27 explicitly depends on the variable @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 is a modulus of the intrinsic curvature .",
    "the surfaces are allowed to self - intersect , and the center of each surface is fixed in the partition function @xmath30 to remove the translational zero - mode .",
    "we note , as described in @xcite , that the intrinsic curvature term @xmath31 comes from the integration measure @xmath32 @xcite in the partition function for the model on a sphere , where @xmath33 is the co - ordination number of the vertex @xmath21 .",
    "the term @xmath34 becomes minimum when @xmath35 for all @xmath21 , and hence it becomes smaller on a smooth torus than on a crumpled one .",
    "it is also exact that the term @xmath36 can be minimized on smooth configurations of the torus .",
    "the reason for using the term @xmath31 , as an intrinsic curvature on the torus as in the model on a sphere @xcite , is that @xmath14 is closely related to the previously mentioned integration measure .",
    "we use two groups of surfaces classified by the ratio @xmath6 in the simulations as mentioned above . the first is characterized by @xmath7 and is composed of surfaces of size @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",

    "figures [ fig-5](c ) and [ fig-5](d ) show the autocorrelation coefficient @xmath70 for the mean square size @xmath57 .",
    "contrary to the behavior of @xmath71 , there is no difference in @xmath70 between the crumpled phase and the smooth phase .",
    "the reason why the convergence speed for @xmath57 in the smooth phase is almost identical to the one in the crumpled phase is that the phase space volume ( @xmath78 ) , where the vertices @xmath18 take their values , is almost the same both in the smooth phase and in the crumpled phase .",
    "the shape of surfaces in the smooth phase is considered to be almost fixed , although they extend to relatively large region in @xmath47 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath70 is very similar to the one in a model on a sphere with extrinsic curvature @xcite but very different from the one in the model on a disk with intrinsic curvature @xcite , where @xmath70 in the smooth phase is quite larger than that in the crumpled phase close to the transition point .",
    "therefore , we understand from @xmath71 and @xmath70 in figs . [ fig-5](a )  [ fig-5](d ) that the toroidal surface can fluctuate only locally , and there is no large - deformation of the surface in the smooth phase . it is quite likely that the shape of surface in the smooth phase is almost unchanged in the model on compact surfaces , and it largely changes in the model on non - compact surfaces so that the phase space volume may be relatively large .",
    "the phenomenon of critical slowing down can not be seen both in @xmath71 and in @xmath70 at the transition point .",

    "the discontinuous change of @xmath81 indicates that the phase transition separates the smooth phase from the crumpled phase .     and of size @xmath44 at ( a ) @xmath84 , and at ( b ) @xmath85 , and ( c ) a section of the surface in ( a ) , ( d ) sections of the surface in ( b ) .",

    "[ fig-8](b ) seems to be a cylinder or a tube , it is almost smooth as can be seen in the section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-8](d ) .",

    "[ fig-8](b ) is rotationally symmetric only around the longitudinal axis of the surface .",
    "the appearance of an axis along such cylindrical and smooth surface in fig .",
    "[ fig-8](b ) does not imply a spontaneous symmetry breaking , which can be seen in a surface model in @xcite .",
    "in fact , a real torus such as the one shown in fig . [",

    "a symmetry of the model in the smooth phase is equivalent to the one of the real torus shown in fig . [",
    "fig-1](b ) . on the contrary , the surface in the crumpled phase",
    "is expected to have a higher symmetry just like in the crumpled phase of the model on a sphere and on a disk .",
    "in summary , our attentions were focused on the compatibility of the topology change and the phase transition in a tethered surface model on compact surfaces with intrinsic curvature . in order to see this compatibility ,",
    "we have studied the model on two kinds of tori in @xmath47 ; one is characterized by @xmath7 and the other by @xmath8 , where @xmath5 and @xmath86 are the length of two sides of rectangles which are deformed to be the tori by connecting the sides .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed on surfaces of size up to @xmath87 in both kinds of tori .",
    "we found that the model undergoes a first - order phase transition separating the smooth phase from the crumpled one on both kinds of tori .",
    "the smooth phase is characterized by hausdorff dimension @xmath88 , which is identical with the topological dimension of surfaces .",
    "the surface in the crumpled phase is completely collapsed , and characterized by large values of hausdorff dimension .",
    "these results indicate that the phase transition on a torus is identical with that on a sphere @xcite and that on a disk @xcite .",
    "thus we can conclude that the topology change and the phase transition is compatible in the tethered model of surfaces with the intrinsic curvature .",
    "moreover , the autocorrelation coefficients @xmath70 obtained on the tori in this paper and on the disk in @xcite enable us to consider that compact surfaces deform very little in the smooth phase , and on the contrary , non - compact surfaces can largely deform in the smooth phase .",
    "an interesting problem to be studied is whether the compatibility is present in the model with extrinsic curvature , which exhibits a first - order transition on a sphere @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to see how the phase transition of the intrinsic curvature model is influenced by the fluidity of lateral diffusion , which is realized on dynamically triangulated surfaces .",
