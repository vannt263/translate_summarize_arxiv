    "let @xmath0 be a compact complex curve and @xmath1 be a meromorphic @xmath2-form on @xmath3 in an open neighborhood of each point @xmath4 we can write    @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a local normalizing parameter at @xmath7 the coefficient @xmath8 of the above series does not depend on the choice of parameter @xmath6 and is called the residue of @xmath1 at @xmath7 the residue is non - zero only at finitely many points @xmath9 where @xmath1 has a pole .",
    "the well - known residue formula says that the sum of residues of @xmath1 over all points of @xmath10 is zero :    @xmath11    indeed , the residue at @xmath12 is equal to the integral of @xmath1 over any sufficiently small cycle enclosing @xmath13 divided by @xmath14 in the complement @xmath15 the form @xmath1 is closed , and the sum of cycles is homologous to zero .",
    "thus , the residue formula follows from the stokes theorem .",
    "although this proof is topological , the residue itself can be defined purely algebraically and one can give an algebraic proof of the residue formula which works in a much more general situation , not only in the case of complex curves ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the late @xmath16 s",
    "a. parshin introduced his notion of multidimensional residue for a rational @xmath17-form @xmath1 on an @xmath17-dimensional algebraic variety @xmath18 ( in @xcite parshin mostly deals with the two - dimensional case , then a. beilinson and v. lomadze in @xcite and @xcite generalized parshin s ideas to the multidimensional case ) .",
    "the main difference between the parshin residue and the classical one - dimensional residue is that in higher dimensions one computes the residue not at a point , but at a complete flag of subvarieties @xmath19 @xmath20    parshin , beilinson , and lomadze proved the reciprocity law for multidimensional residues , which generalizes the classical residue formula :    fix a partial flag of irreducible subvarieties @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is omitted ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "then @xmath24 where the sum is taken over all irreducible @xmath25-dimensional subvarieties @xmath26 such that @xmath27 more precisely , the statement of the theorem is that there are only finitely many summands which are not zeros , and the sum of non - zero summands is zero .",
    "in addition , if @xmath28 is proper ( compact in the complex case ) , then one has the same relation for @xmath29 @xmath30 again , there are finitely many non - zero summands and their sum is zero .",
    "all these papers are purely algebraic .",
    "the methods used by parshin , beilinson and lomadze are applicable in very general settings , not only over complex numbers . however , in the complex case one would expect a more geometric variant of the theory .",
    "brylinski and d. a. mclaughlin give a more topological treatment of the complex case in @xcite .",
    "given a flag @xmath31 they introduce _ flag - localized _ homology groups @xmath32 and a homology class @xmath33 such that @xmath34 for any meromorphic @xmath17-form @xmath35 the class @xmath36 is obtained from of the fundamental class @xmath37 by applying the boundary homomorphisms in the appropriate flag - localized homology groups @xmath17 times .",
    "brylinski and d. a. mclaughlin mention , that the class @xmath36 could be constructed in a more geometric way , so that it is naturally represented by a union of certain real @xmath17-tori .",
    "however , they only give such a construction in the case when all elements of the flag @xmath38 are smooth .    in this paper",
    "we develop a different approach to the construction of the class @xmath39 we use the geometry of the whitney stratified spaces to introduce the leray coboundary operators @xmath40 for any two consecutive strata @xmath41 ( see definition [ order on strata ] ) of a stratified space . given a flag @xmath31 and a meromorphic top - form @xmath1 on @xmath42 one can choose a stratification of @xmath42 such that the flag @xmath38 consists of closures of strata , and @xmath1 is regular on the top - dimensional stratum",

    "we prove that @xmath45 the construction of the leray coboundary operators is very geometric . in particular ,",
    "the class @xmath46 is naturally represented by a smooth submanifold @xmath47 which is a union of smooth @xmath17-dimensional tori @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , in the original parshin s construction , the residue at the flag @xmath38 is defined as a sum of certain more delicate residues ( we briefly review parshin s definitions in the section [ section parshin s theory reviewed ] ) .",
    "we show , that the tori @xmath49 naturally correspond to the summands in the parshin s definition .",
    "let @xmath50 be the algebraic surface , given by the equation @xmath51 consider the flag @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the surface @xmath54",
    "@xmath28 is the @xmath55-axis ( which is the singular locus of @xmath56 ) , and @xmath57 is the origin .    the intersection of @xmath56 with the real plane is the cone over a figure eight ( see figure [ figure eight ] ) .",

    "therefore , one gets two tori @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xmath73    the parshin residue of a meromorphic @xmath74-form @xmath1 on @xmath56 can be computed via integral over @xmath75 @xmath76    consider the whitney umbrella  the surface @xmath77 given by the equation @xmath78 consider the flag @xmath52 where , again , @xmath53 is the surface , @xmath28 is the @xmath55-axis , and @xmath57 is the origin ( figure [ umbrella ] ) . notice , that @xmath28 again coincide with the singular locus of @xmath59     with the real space.,width=377 ]    in the same way as in the previous example , one can consider a small loop around the origin on the @xmath63 and , again , @xmath53 has two branches at each point of the loop .",
    "however , as one goes around the origin on @xmath79 the branches interchange .",
    "therefore , the class @xmath80 is represented by just one torus in this case , and there is only one summand in the parshin s definition of the residue .",
    "coboundary operators satisfy an interesting relation : let @xmath81 be two strata such that there are @xmath25 intermediate strata @xmath82 and these intermediate strata are incomparable ( equivalently , for any @xmath83 from @xmath2 to @xmath84 @xmath85 are consecutive strata ) .",

    "@xmath325 is a hypersurface in a normal variety .",
    "it follows that there exists a ( meromorphic ) function @xmath326 on @xmath314 which has zero of order @xmath2 at a generic point of @xmath327 since meromorphic functions are the same on @xmath328 and @xmath317 one can consider @xmath326 as a function on @xmath320 then one can extend ( in an arbitrary way ) @xmath326 to @xmath329 and so on .",
    "for simplicity , we denote all these functions by @xmath330 now @xmath326 is defined on @xmath42 and can be consecutively restricted to @xmath331 for @xmath332      * remark .",
    "* one can choose local parameters in such a way , that @xmath326 has zero of order @xmath2 at generic point not only of @xmath335 but of the whole @xmath336 then these local parameters work for all parshin points with the flag @xmath337 we only use local parameters with this property .            take a generic point @xmath341 both @xmath342 and @xmath343 are smooth at @xmath344 moreover , parameters @xmath345 provide an isomorphism of a neighborhood of @xmath346 to an open subset in @xmath347 and @xmath348 is given by the equation @xmath349 in this neighborhood .",
    "restrict the function @xmath185 to the transversal section to @xmath343 at @xmath350 given by fixing the parameters @xmath351 the restriction can be expanded into a laurent series in @xmath352 it is easy to see that the coefficients of this expansion depend analytically on @xmath344 moreover , one can see that the coefficients are meromorphic functions on @xmath353 let @xmath354 be the coefficient at @xmath355 in this expansion .",
    "then @xmath356 is a meromorphic @xmath303-form on @xmath353            ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite)[parshin s reciprocity law ] let @xmath1 be a meromorphic @xmath17-form on @xmath18 fix a partial flag of irreducible subvarieties @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is omitted ( @xmath23 ) . then @xmath24 where the sum is taken over all irreducible @xmath25-dimensional subvarieties @xmath26 such that @xmath365 ( in this formula only finitely many summands are non zero . )",
    "we want to apply the stratification theory to study the parshin points and residues .",
    "therefore , we need to stratify all the spaces in the normalization diagram in such a way that the stratifications respect the normalization maps @xmath367 the following lemma easily follows from the well known results on existence of whitney stratifications ( see section 1.7 in @xcite , for example ) :    * notation .",
    "* let @xmath0 be an irreducible ( complex analytic ) variety considered with a fixed whitney stratification .",

    "the normalization map @xmath379 to any stratum in the source is a covering over a stratum in the image .",
    "let @xmath384 be a point , such that @xmath314 is singular at @xmath7 note , that by dimension reasons and condition of the frontier , the only strata intersecting a small neighborhood of @xmath176 are @xmath385 and @xmath386 note , that @xmath326 is regular in @xmath387 and at a generic point of @xmath388 therefore , by extension theorem for normal varieties , @xmath326 is regular at @xmath7    note also , that @xmath326 is non - vanishing in @xmath389 and has zero of order @xmath2 at a generic point of @xmath336 therefore , @xmath390 coincide with @xmath381 near @xmath7 moreover , easy to see , that the germ of @xmath326 at @xmath176 generates the ideal of the germ of @xmath381 at @xmath7 indeed , if @xmath391 is a function , regular at @xmath176 and vanishing on @xmath392 then @xmath393 is regular at @xmath176 by the extension theorem for normal varieties .",
    "now , let @xmath394 be any coordinate system on @xmath381 at @xmath7 easy to see , that the functions @xmath395 generate the maximal ideal in the local ring of @xmath396 therefore , @xmath176 is a smooth point of @xmath383      moreover , we will show that @xmath46 naturally splits into the sum @xmath400 such that @xmath401 note , that according to the construction of the leray coboundary operator , @xmath46 is represented by a smooth compact real @xmath17-dimensional submanifold @xmath402 moreover , @xmath403 is obtained from a point by the following procedure : there are @xmath17 steps , and on each step we take the total space of an oriented fibration with @xmath2-dimensional compact fiber over the result of the previous step .",
    "therefore , @xmath403 is a union of @xmath17-dimensional tori .",
    "we ll show , that the connected components of @xmath403 are in natural one - to - one correspondence with the points of @xmath322 and the connected component @xmath49 corresponding to @xmath404 represents @xmath405    fix control data on the stratification @xmath131 of @xmath18 let us use these control data to construct the representative @xmath406 of @xmath407 let us also denote by @xmath408 the representative of @xmath409)\\in h_k(\\breve v_k),$ ] constructed in the same way .",
    "note , that for @xmath413 @xmath414 is the preimage of @xmath415 under the map @xmath416 since @xmath417 and @xmath418 are consecutive strata , it follows that the restriction @xmath419 is a proper submersion to @xmath420                      [ lifting control data ] let @xmath102 and @xmath438 be two stratified spaces , consisting of two strata each : @xmath439 @xmath440 and @xmath441 @xmath442 let @xmath443 be a map , such that @xmath444 is a covering over @xmath0 and @xmath445 is a covering over @xmath210 let @xmath446 and @xmath447 be the control data on @xmath130 then there exist control data @xmath448 on @xmath449 such that            indeed , the map from the connected components of @xmath459 to the connected components of @xmath461 is given by the retraction @xmath462 existence of the inverse to this map follows from the fact that @xmath463 is a complex hypersurface in the manifold @xmath464 indeed , if @xmath465 is a hypersurface in a complex manifold @xmath466 then there is only one connected component of @xmath101 in a neighborhood of a connected component of @xmath467            since we have chosen the control data on @xmath435 to be coherent with the control data on @xmath430 ( given by restricting the control data from the ambient space ) , we have the equality on the level of representatives .",
    "now we use the local parameters @xmath333 to construct cycles @xmath478 such that , on the one side , it is obvious that @xmath479 and , on the other , @xmath480 is homologically equivalent to @xmath481 in @xmath475    function @xmath482 is regular and non - vanishing in @xmath483 and has zero of order one at a generic point of @xmath484 it follows immediately , that @xmath482 is regular on @xmath435 and the equation @xmath485 defines @xmath461 in @xmath464                      in order to get the parshin s reciprocity law from the theorem [ relation ] and the above consideration , one needs a fixed stratification of @xmath102 , such that all non - zero residues of a given form @xmath1 are in the flags consisting of closures of strata of the stratification .",
    "it turns out , that any whitney stratification , such that @xmath1 is regular on the top dimensional stratum is good enough .",
    "more precisely , we have the following theorem :    [ criteria for non - trivial residues ] let @xmath102 be an @xmath17-dimensional variety and @xmath1 be a meromorphic @xmath17-form on @xmath130 let @xmath500 be a whitney stratification of @xmath105 such that @xmath1 is regular on @xmath501 .",
    "consider the normalization diagram for the flag @xmath164 let @xmath506 and let @xmath333 be local parameters .",
    "let @xmath131 be a stratification of @xmath102 satisfying conditions of the lemma [ stratification of the normalization diagram ] , and such that all strata of the stratification @xmath507 are unions of strata of @xmath508 as usual , we denote by @xmath418 the stratum of @xmath131 which is open and dense in @xmath509      1 .",
    "let @xmath510 be consecutive strata of @xmath511 and let @xmath81 be the consecutive strata of @xmath512 such that @xmath0 is an open dense subset in @xmath513 and @xmath129 is an open dense subset in @xmath514 let @xmath515 and @xmath516 be the embeddings .",
    "then it easily follows from the construction of coboundary operators @xmath266 and @xmath517 and the independence of these operators from the choice of the control data , that @xmath518 2 .",
