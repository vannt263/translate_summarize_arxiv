    "multipath fading channels_. in multipath fading channels , the transmitted signal propagates along a multitude of paths , and the gains and delays of these paths vary over time . in general , the path delays differ from each other , and the receiver thus observes a weighted sum of delayed replicas of the transmitted signal , where the weights are random",
    ". we shall slightly abuse nomenclature and refer to each summand in the received signal as a path , and to the corresponding weight as its path gain , even if it is in fact composed of a multitude of paths .",
    "we consider a _",
    "noncoherent _ channel model , where transmitter and receiver are cognizant of the statistics of the path gains , but are ignorant of their realization .",
    "multipath fading channels arise in wireless communications , where obstacles in the surroundings reflect the transmitted signal and force it to propagate along multiple paths , and where relative movements of transmitter , receiver , and obstacles lead to time - variations of the path gains and delays .",
    "examples of wireless communication scenarios where the receiver observes typically more than one path include _ radio communications _",
    "( particularly if the transmitted signal is of large bandwidth as , for example , in _ ultra - wideband _ or in _ cdma _ ) and _ underwater acoustic communications_.    the capacity of noncoherent multipath fading channels has been investigated extensively in the wideband regime , where the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is typically small .",
    "it was shown by kennedy that , in the limit as the available bandwidth tends to infinity , the capacity of the fading channel is the same as the capacity of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel of equal received power ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "8.6 ) and references therein .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , not much is known about the capacity of noncoherent multipath fading channels at high snr .",
    "for the special case of noncoherent _ frequency - flat _ fading channels ( where we only have _ one _ path ) , it was shown by lapidoth & moser @xcite that if the fading process is of finite entropy rate , then at high snr capacity grows double - logarithmically in the snr .",
    "this is much slower than the logarithmic growth of the awgn capacity @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the high - snr behavior of the capacity of noncoherent _ multipath _ fading channels ( where the number of paths is typically greater than one ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the capacity of such channels does not merely grow slower with the snr than the capacity of the awgn channel , but may be even _ bounded _ in the snr . in other words , for such channels",
    "the capacity does not necessarily tend to infinity as the snr tends to infinity .",
    "we derive a necessary and a sufficient condition for the capacity to be bounded in the snr .",
    "we show that if the variances of the path gains decay _ exponentially or slower _ , then capacity is bounded in the snr .",
    "in contrast , if the variances of the path gains decay _",
    "faster than exponentially _ , then capacity is unbounded in the snr .",
    "we further show that if the number of paths is finite , then at high snr capacity increases double - logarithmically with the snr , and the capacity pre - loglog , defined as the limiting ratio of the capacity to @xmath0 as @xmath1 tends to infinity , is @xmath2 irrespective of the number of paths .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a mathematical description of the considered channel model in section  [ sec : channelmodel ] .",
    "section  [ sec : capacity ] is devoted to channel capacity .",
    "our main results are summarized in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "they follow from upper bounds and lower bounds on channel capacity , which are derived in sections  [ sec : upperproof ] and [ sec : lowerproof ] , respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] concludes the paper with a brief summary and a discussion of our results .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the set of complex numbers and the set of positive integers , respectively .",
    "we consider a discrete - time multipath fading channel whose channel output @xmath5 at time @xmath6 corresponding to the time-1 through time-@xmath7 channel inputs @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 models additive noise , and @xmath11 denotes the time-@xmath7 gain of the @xmath12-th path .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) , zero - mean , variance-@xmath13 , circularly - symmetric , complex gaussian random variables . for each path @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 denotes the set of nonnegative integers ) , we assume that @xmath16 is a zero - mean , complex stationary process .",
    "we denote its variance and its differential entropy rate by @xmath17 and @xmath18 we shall say that the channel has a _ finite number of paths _ , if for some finite integer @xmath19 @xmath20 we assume that @xmath21 .",
    "we further assume @xmath22 and @xmath23 where the set @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "( when the path gains are gaussian , then the latter condition is equivalent to saying that the mean - square error in predicting the present path gain from its past is strictly positive , i.e. , that the present path gain can not be predicted perfectly from its past . )",
    "we finally assume that the processes @xmath26 are independent ( `` uncorrelated scattering '' ) ; that they are jointly independent of @xmath10 ; and that the joint law of @xmath27 does not depend on the input sequence @xmath28 .",
    "we consider a noncoherent channel model where neither transmitter nor receiver is cognizant of the realization of @xmath16 , @xmath14 , but both are aware of their law .",
    "we do not assume that the path gains are gaussian .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the sequence @xmath30 .",
    "we define the capacity ( in nats per channel use ) as @xmath31 where the supremum is over all joint distributions on @xmath32 satisfying the power constraint @xmath33 and where snr is defined as @xmath34    by fano s inequality , no rate above @xmath35 is achievable .",
    "( see @xcite for a definition of an achievable rate . )",
    "we do not claim that there is a coding theorem associated with , i.e. , that @xmath35 is achievable .",
    "a coding theorem will hold , for example , if the number of paths is finite , and if the processes corresponding to these paths @xmath36 are jointly ergodic , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  2 ) .",
    "the special case of noncoherent frequency - flat fading channels ( where we have only one path ) was studied by lapidoth and moser @xcite .",
    "they showed that if the fading process @xmath37 is ergodic , then the capacity satisfies @xmath38 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  4.41 ) ) , where @xmath39 denotes the natural logarithm function .",
    "thus , at high snr , the capacity of noncoherent frequency - flat fading channels grows double - logarithmically with the snr .",
    "lapidoth and moser concluded that communicating over noncoherent frequency - flat fading channels at high snr is extremely power - inefficient , as one should expect to square the snr for every additional bit per channel use .    in this paper ,",
    "inter alia _ that communicating over noncoherent multipath fading channels at high snr is not merely power - inefficient , but may be even worse : if the delay spread is large in the sense that the sequence @xmath40 ( which describes the variances of the path gains ) decays exponentially or slower , then capacity is bounded in the snr . for such channels , capacity does not tend to infinity as the snr tends to infinity .",
    "the main results of this paper are presented in the following section .",
    "our main results are a sufficient and a necessary condition on @xmath40 for @xmath35 to be bounded in @xmath1 , as well as a characterization of the capacity pre - loglog when the number of paths is finite .",

    ", we can say that when @xmath40 decays _ exponentially or slower _",
    ", then @xmath35 is bounded in @xmath1 , and when @xmath40 decays _ faster than exponentially _",
    ", then @xmath35 is unbounded in @xmath1 .",
    "the condition on the left - hand side ( lhs ) of is surely satisfied if the channel has a finite number of paths , as in this case @xmath50 which implies @xmath51 consequently , it follows from corollary  [ cor : bounded ] that if the number of paths is finite , then @xmath35 is unbounded in @xmath1 .",
    "however , for this case the high - snr behavior of the capacity can be characterized more accurately : theorem  [ thm : finite ] ahead shows that if the number of paths is finite , then the capacity pre - loglog , defined as @xmath52 is @xmath2 irrespective of the number of paths .",
    "the pre - loglog in this case is thus the same as for frequency - flat fading .",
    "[ thm : finite ] consider the above channel model .",
    "further assume that the number of paths is finite .",
    "then , irrespective of the number of paths , the capacity pre - loglog is given by @xmath53    see section  [ sub : upper2 ] for the converse and sections  [ sub : lower ] & [ sub : preloglog ] for the direct part .",
    "when studying multipath fading channels at low or at moderate snr , it is often assumed that the channel has a finite number of paths , even if the number of paths is in reality infinite .",
    "this assumption is commonly justified by saying that only the first @xmath54 paths are relevant , since the variances of the remaining paths are typically small and hence the influence of these paths on the capacity is marginal . as we see from theorems  [ thm : bounded ] & [ thm : finite ] , this argument is not valid anymore when studying multipath fading channels at high snr .",
    "in fact , when for example the sequence of variances @xmath40 decays exponentially , then according to part  ( i ) of theorem  [ thm : bounded ] the capacity is bounded in the snr .",
    "however , if we consider only the first @xmath54 paths and set the other paths to zero , then it follows from theorem  [ thm : finite ] that , irrespective of @xmath55 , the capacity increases double - logarithmically with the snr .",
    "thus , even though the variances of the remaining paths @xmath56 , @xmath57 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath55 sufficiently large , these paths may have a significant influence on the capacity behavior at high snr .",
    "the reason why paths with a small variance can affect the capacity behavior is that the capacity depends on the variance of the product between the path gains and the transmitted signal and not on the variance of the path gains only . since at high snr",
    "the variance of @xmath58 might be huge even if the variance of @xmath59 is small , the relevance of a path is determined not only by its own variance but also by the power available at the transmitter .",
    "the number of paths that are needed to approximate a multipath channel typically depends on the @xmath1 and may grow to infinity as the @xmath1 tends to infinity .    in order to prove the above results , we derive upper and lower bounds on the capacity .",
    "since these bounds may also be of independent interest , we summarize them in the following propositions .",
    "@xmath60 [ prop : upperbounds ]    [ prop : upperbound1 ] consider the above channel model .",
    "further assume that for some @xmath61 and some @xmath62 @xmath63 then the capacity @xmath35 is upper bounded by @xmath64 where @xmath65    [ prop : upperbound2 ] consider the above channel model .",
    "further assume that @xmath66 then @xmath67    part  [ prop : upperbound1 ] is proven in section  [ sub : upper1 ] , and part  [ prop : upperbound2 ] in section  [ sub : upper2 ] .",
    "for example , if @xmath40 is a geometric sequence , i.e. , @xmath68 for some @xmath61 , and if the path gains are gaussian and memoryless so @xmath69 then part  ( i ) of proposition  [ prop : upperbounds ] yields @xmath70 part  ( ii ) of proposition  [ prop : upperbounds ] combines with to show that the pre - loglog of a multipath fading channel can never be larger than the pre - loglog of a frequency - flat fading channel .",
    "this result is consistent with the intuition that at high snr the multipath behavior is detrimental .",
    "our last result is a lower bound on the capacity .",
    "this bound is the basis for the proof of part  ( ii ) of theorem  [ thm : bounded ] and for the direct part of theorem  [ thm : finite ] .    [",
    "prop : lowerbound ] consider the above channel model .",
    "further assume that @xmath71 let @xmath72 be some positive integer that satisfies @xmath73 ( typically @xmath74 depends on @xmath75 ) , and let @xmath76 be some arbitrary positive integer that is allowed to depend on @xmath74 .",
    "then the capacity @xmath35 is lower bounded by    lcl c ( ) & & ^1/+(-1 - 2(+ ) ) , + [ eq : proplowerbound ]    see section  [ sub : lower ] .",
    "in this section , we establish a proof of proposition  [ prop : upperbounds ] , which in turn will be used to prove part  ( i ) of theorem  [ thm : bounded ] and the converse to theorem  [ thm : finite ] .",

    "the conclusions that can be drawn from these results are twofold .",
    "first , multipath channels with an infinite number of paths and multipath channels with a finite number of paths have in general completely different capacity behaviors at high snr . indeed , at high snr , if the number of paths is finite , then capacity grows double - logarithmically with the snr ,",
    "whereas if the number of paths is infinite , then capacity may even be bounded in the snr .",
    "thus , while for low or for moderate snr it might be reasonable to approximate a multipath channel with infinitely many paths by a multipath channel with only a finite number paths , this is not reasonable when the snr tends to infinity .",
    "the number of paths that are needed to approximate a multipath channel typically depends on the @xmath1 and may grow to infinity as the @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "second , the above results indicate that the high - snr behavior of the capacity of multipath fading channels depends critically on the assumed channel model .",
