    "consider the mode algebra [ eq : mode - alg - intro ] [ a_m , b_n ] = m ( a , b ) _ m+n,0 k  , where @xmath5 is central , @xmath6 are elements of a vector space @xmath0 , @xmath7 is a non - degenerate bilinear form on @xmath0 and @xmath8 . if the bracket is anti - symmetric and the bilinear form symmetric , this is the mode algebra of @xmath9 free bosons .",
    "if , conversely , the bracket is symmetric and @xmath7 antisymmetric , non - degeneracy requires @xmath9 to be even and is the mode algebra of @xmath10 pairs of symplectic fermions .",
    "both cases can be treated on the same footing if one takes @xmath0 to be a super - vector space and @xmath7 to be super - symmetric .",
    "one arrives at what kac called free super - bosons @xcite .",
    "denote the mode algebra by @xmath11 .",
    "representations of @xmath11 which are ` bounded below ' are easy to describe : they are controlled by representations of the zero mode algebra on the subspace of ground states .",
    "it is worth pointing out that even in the free boson case , i.e.  when @xmath0 is purely ( parity-)even , non - semisimple @xmath11-modules are included ; this is in contrast to the more familiar case of unitary free boson models where the action of the zero modes can be diagonalised .",
    "starting from the category of bounded @xmath11-representations , one can now try to use the monodromy and factorisation properties of conformal blocks to endow this category with a braided monoidal structure . actually , as outlined in section [ sec : into - fsb ] below , this computation is very straightforward and the result is not surprising : it gives an instance of drinfeld s category for metric lie algebras specialised to the abelian case @xcite .",
    "the outcome is more interesting if one includes @xmath4-twisted representations , i.e.  representations of the mode algebra with @xmath12 .",
    "most of the effort ( and pages ) will be spent on this case . in the approach",
    "i will take , the existence of a braided monoidal structure on twisted and untwisted representations together requires @xmath0 to be purely odd .",
    "this is the symplectic fermion case , and the results are outlined in section [ sec : into - sf ] below .",
    "( if @xmath0 has an even component , the tensor product of two twisted representations does not satisfy the required finiteness properties . )",
    "the main motivation behind this work is to provide the basic categorical data needed for the classification of conformal field theories whose chiral algebra includes the ( even part of the ) symplectic fermion vertex operator super - algebra .",
    "symplectic fermion models are one of the most basic and best studied examples of logarithmic conformal field theories .",
    "they first appeared in @xcite and their representation theory and fusion rules were investigated in @xcite .",
    "bulk and boundary conformal field theories built from symplectic fermions were studied in @xcite .",
    "some recent works focus on the relation to models with @xmath13 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper constitute the first explicit computation of the associativity and braiding isomorphisms on the category of chiral algebra representations for a logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional abelian lie super - algebra with non - degenerate supersymmetric bilinear form ( see section [ sec : lie - super ] for details and conventions ) .",
    "the category @xmath14 of bounded - below @xmath11-modules on which @xmath5 acts as the identity ( section [ sec : h - mod - untwist ] ) is equivalent to the category @xmath15 of @xmath0-modules ( theorem [ thm : ind - equiv - untw ] ) . for the sake of this introduction ,",
    "we restrict our attention to finite dimensional @xmath0-modules and to @xmath11-modules with finite - dimensional spaces of ground states ; this will be indicated by the superscript ` fd ' . in the main text , this is relaxed to local finiteness .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 . by a vertex operator from @xmath18 to @xmath19 we mean a map @xmath20 depending smoothly on a positive real number @xmath21 , and which satisfies the standard mode exchange relations ( definition [ def : vertex - op ] ) a_m v(x ) = v(x ) ( x^m a id_b + id_a a_m )  .",
    "one should think of @xmath22 as a ground state @xmath23 inserted at point @xmath21 , mapping @xmath24 into ( a completion of ) @xmath19 .",
    "such vertex operators can be expressed as normal ordered exponentials and one finds that the space of vertex operators is naturally isomorphic to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the representations of @xmath0 on the space of ground states of @xmath27 , @xmath19 ( theorem [ thm : g - bijective ] ) .",
    "thus , as expected , the spaces of vertex operators from any two representations into a third are controlled solely by the action of the zero mode algebra @xmath0 .",
    "denote the space of vertex operators from @xmath18 to @xmath19 by @xmath28 .",
    "if we fix @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we can think of this as a functor from @xmath31 into vector spaces .",
    "the tensor product ` @xmath32 ' on @xmath31 induced by the vertex operators is defined to be the representing object of this functor .",
    "that is , it is an object @xmath33 such that @xmath34 and @xmath28 are naturally isomorphic ( as functors in the argument @xmath35 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , theorem [ thm : g - bijective ] implies @xmath36 , and so we simply have [ eq : intro - tensor - untw ] a b = a b  , where the right hand side is the tensor product of @xmath0-modules ( theorem [ thm:*-tensor ] ) .",
    "the monodromy properties of analytically continued vertex operators provide us with a braiding isomorphism @xmath37 on @xmath31 . evaluating the asymptotic behaviour of a product @xmath38 of two vertex operators for @xmath39 results in associativity isomorphisms @xmath40 .",
    "these are computed in proposition [ prop : braiding - iso - from-3pt ] and section [ sec : assoc - compute ] and take the simple form [ eq : intro - a - c - untwist ] _ a , b , c = id_a b c , c_a , b = _ a , b ( - i )  . here , @xmath41 is the exchange of tensor factors for super - vector spaces ( which involves a parity sign if both arguments are odd ) and @xmath42 is the copairing associated to @xmath7 .",
    "( the associator of super - vector spaces was suppressed in writing ` @xmath43 ' . )",
    "the exponential in the expression for the braiding converges because @xmath44 is finite - dimensional .",
    "indeed , this is the reason to impose finite - dimensionality in the first place ( or at least local finiteness as in the main text ) .",
    "it is proved in proposition [ prop : c0-monoidal ] that the data turn @xmath31 into a braided monoidal category . as mentioned above , this is a ( very simple , since @xmath0 is abelian ) instance of drinfeld s category for metric lie algebras .",
    "let now @xmath0 be purely odd . in this case",
    "we include representations of the twisted mode algebra @xmath45 , which is the same as , but with @xmath12 .",
    "since there are no zero modes , the category of bounded - below @xmath45-representations is equivalent to the category @xmath46 of super - vector spaces ( theorem [ thm : ind - equiv - tw ] ) .",
    "consider the @xmath4-graded category @xmath47 with components = _ 0 + _ 1 , _ 0 = ( )  , _ 1 = ect  .",
    "( since @xmath0 is purely odd , it acts nilpotently and we can drop the assumption of finite - dimensionality . ) as in the previous case , one defines spaces of vertex operators @xmath28 for @xmath48 . via the same representing object condition ,",
    "one obtains a tensor product on @xmath47 ( theorem [ thm:*-tensor ] ) : in addition to we have a b  =   \\ {    ' '' ''    . here",
    ", @xmath49 is the forgetful functor @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the universal enveloping algebra of the abelian lie super - algebra @xmath0 . since @xmath0 is purely odd , @xmath51 is finite - dimensional .",
    "is the exterior algebra of @xmath0 , provided @xmath0 is understood as a vector space rather than a super - vector space . in @xmath46",
    ", @xmath51 is the symmetric algebra of @xmath0 ( since @xmath0 is purely odd ) . ]    as above , one obtains braiding isomorphisms from the analytic continuation of vertex operators .",
    "in addition to one finds ( sections [ sec:3pt - braid ] and [ sec : c - hexagon ] ) : c_a , b  =   \\ {    ' '' ''    . here @xmath52 is the number of pairs of symplectic fermions , @xmath53 , and as above , @xmath42 is the copairing associated to @xmath7 .",
    "the indices @xmath54 in @xmath55 determine on which tensor factors the two copies of @xmath0 act .",
    "finally , @xmath56 denotes the parity involution on the super - vector space @xmath30 .",
    "the most tedious part of the computation is to find the associator on @xmath47 .",
    "this is done by explicitly computing the four - point blocks for the eight possible ways to choose the representations from @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "these blocks are listed in table [ tab:4pt - blocks ] ; they have been computed by conformal field theory methods , in particular by using the knizhnik - zamolodchikov differential equation .",
    "because these methods lie outside of the formalism set up in sections [ sec : mode+rep ] and [ sec : vo+tensor ] , one would now have to prove that the resulting blocks indeed agree with the composition of vertex operators .",
    "i have only been able to do this for two of the eight cases and for this reason , section [ sec:4pt - assoc ] is equipped with a ` @xmath59 '  in the context of the present formalism , the results in section [ sec:4pt - assoc ] should be treated as conjectures .",
    "nonetheless , the explicit four - point blocks allow one to determine the associativity isomorphisms @xmath60 on @xmath47 .",
    "these are listed in section [ sec : c - pentagon ] .",
    "it is proved in theorems [ thm : c - associator ] and [ thm : c - braiding ] that the data @xmath32 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 turn @xmath47 into a braided monoidal category .",
    "this is done by explicitly verifying the 16 pentagon and 16 hexagon identities , or , more precisely , by referring to @xcite where this has already been done in a more general setting .",
    "a determined person should be able to reproduce the braided monoidal structure presented here in the formalism of vertex operator algebras .",
    "since the symplectic fermion vertex operator algebra is @xmath63-cofinite @xcite , the tensor product theory of @xcite can be applied . as a step in this direction ,",
    "a few intertwining operators were recently provided in @xcite .",
    "a treatment in this setting would have the practical and conceptual advantage that the general results of @xcite ( and those announced in @xcite ) would guarantee that the pentagon and hexagon axioms hold .",
    "the paper concludes with two small applications to symplectic fermions . in section [ sec : torusblock ] , torus conformal blocks with insertions from @xmath51 and their relation to characters are discussed . in section [ sec : uh - algebra ] , @xmath51 is turned into an algebra in @xmath47 and the resulting multiplication is compared to a boundary operator product expansion from @xcite .",
