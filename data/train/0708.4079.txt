    "the first definite extrasolar planet orbiting a normal star was detected in 1995 ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) .",
    "the main current techniques for detecting extrasolar planets ( doppler , transits etc ) are indirect in nature , seeing the influence of the planet on the light from the host star rather than detecting the planetary properties directly .",
    "these methods infer rather limited information about the planet ( such as the mass , or often just a lower limit on the mass ) .",
    "observations at other wavelengths , such as low radio frequencies , have the potential for determining certain planetary properties that will be important in understanding planetary structure and evolution .",
    "by analogy with the magnetic planets in the solar system , observations at radio wavelengths of extrasolar planets offers the ( as yet unrealised ) potential for a new way of directly detecting extrasolar planets and also a means of inferring information about the characteristics of the planets , such as the existence of a magnetosphere , the planetary magnetic field strength , planetary rotation and even the presence of moons , that may be difficult via other means ( cf higgins et al .",
    "1997 ) , and which will be important in developing our understanding of how these planets form and evolve .",
    "low frequency radio observations of solar system planets have been made for decades ( see , for example , bastian et al .",
    "burke & franklin ( 1955 ) were the first to discover radio emission from jupiter , which is an extremely bright and variable source at decametric ( 330  mhz ) wavelengths .",
    "due to ionospheric cut - off , it was not until the voyager spacecraft era that the other solar system gas giant planets were detected ( broadfoot et al .",
    "1981 ) .    for solar system planets , the dominant mechanism for the low frequency radio emission",
    "is believed to be the electron cyclotron maser .",
    "the characteristic emission frequencies are determined by the magnetic field strength near the surface of the planet .",
    "the level of emission is dependent on local conditions ( such as rotation and satellite interactions ) but in essence all that is required is there to be a distribution of energetic electrons within the planetary magnetic field , with an anisotropy in velocity space and a large ratio of gyro to plasma frequencies .",
    "we expect that massive extrasolar planets will , like jupiter , have a dynamo driven magnetic field and a similar interaction with the wind of their host star .",
    "if this is the case then they will produce radio emission .",
    "all the larger planets in our own solar system produce radio emission , so there is no reason why we should not expect the same to occur for extrasolar planets ( ness et al .",
    "the major differences between extrasolar planets and solar system planets will be the sensitivity required to detect them and the frequencies at which the emission will occur ( stevens 2005 ) .",
    "the radio detection of extrasolar planets has been attempted several times , with a variety of different telescopes , at different frequencies .",
    "winglee et al .",
    "( 1986 ) used the very large array ( vla ) ( at 0.33  ghz and 1.4  ghz ) to observe six nearby stars , however no detections were made .",
    "bastian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also used the vla for multi - frequency observations of extrasolar planets at 1.4  ghz , 0.33  ghz and 74  mhz .",
    "no detections were reported , with sensitivities of @xmath5  mjy , at the lowest frequency used .",
    "more recently , the ukrainian utr-2 telescope has surveyed around 20 extrasolar planetary systems in the 1025  mhz range , with a sensitivity of about 1.6  jy .",
    "this survey produced no detections ( ryabov et al .",
    "further to this lazio & farrell ( 2007 ) have observed @xmath6 bootes with the vla at 74  mhz .",
    "no detection was made , with an upper limit of around 150  mjy .",
    "winterhalter et al . ( 2006 ) have used the gmrt to observe extrasolar planets , focusing on short period systems .",
    "the targets observed were @xmath6 bootes , hd 162020 , hd 179949 , 70 virginis and @xmath7 andromedae . no detections were made .",
    "in addition to these pointed observations , several large area radio surveys exist and these can provide constraints on the emission from extrasolar planets .",
    "these include the cambridge 6c ( 150  mhz ) , 7c ( 150  mhz ) and 8c ( 38  mhz ) surveys and the vla low - frequency sky survey ( vlss , 74  mhz ) . for details of these surveys see hales et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and lazio et al .",
    ".    there may be several reasons for these non - detections ; insufficient sensitivity or incorrect ( or even unlucky ) target or frequency selection are probably key .",
    "we do not know how the radio emission from jupiter - like planets really scales in other systems .",
    "there are also issues of beaming of the emission and time variability . nonetheless , the prize of detecting extrasolar planets at radio wavelengths is sufficiently great to warrant continued searches .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  2 we review our understanding of the expected radio emission from extrasolar planets . in section",
    "3 we introduce the gmrt targets and selection rationale . the data analysis and results are presented in section  4 , and in section  5 we discuss the consequences and also briefly discuss limits from low - frequency observations .",
    "before we discuss extrasolar planetary radio emission , it will be useful to review the jovian low frequency radio emission .",
    "below a cut - off frequency of @xmath8  mhz , the jovian radio emission is thought to be dominated by cyclotron - maser processes from kev electrons in the auroral regions of the planet .",
    "the power radiated by jupiter at this frequency range is several hundred gigawatts and below the cut - off frequency the radio power is comparable to that of the quiet sun ( winterhalter et al .",
    "the emission is variable and solar events such as coronal mass ejections cause the emission intensity to increase .",
    "apart from the solar wind connection there is an additional component related to io . the moon - planet interaction produces a significant increase in decametric emission ( gurnett et al .",
    "at higher ( ghz ) frequencies , synchrotron emission generated from the acceleration of energetic electrons , trapped in jupiter s magnetic field dominates the emission process .",
    "this means for detection of an extrasolar planet the intrinsic planetary emission will have to be much brighter than jupiter .",
    "this can be achieved by the planet being in a shorter period orbit than jupiter , or being more massive than jupiter , or to be orbiting a star with a denser stellar wind than the sun .",
    "the first two points have no impact on the radio flux of the star , but the third will .",
    "the stellar mass - loss rate @xmath9 will affect the planetary radio emission , and is related to the stellar luminosity @xmath10 ( wood et al .",
    "2002 ) . from the scaling law for radio emission for extrasolar planets",
    ", we expect the planets observed here to be much more luminous than jupiter , meaning their expected flux levels could be in the the mjy range and potentially detectable ( stevens 2005 ) .",
    "consequently , although jupiter and the sun can have comparable luminosities at low frequencies , for the brighter extrasolar planets , we expect the planets to be much brighter than their stellar hosts .",
    "this argument assumes constant sources , rather than flaring sources , and stellar flare activity may boost the stellar emission for short periods .",
    "in addition , it is believed that extrasolar planets will have a highly polarised emission ( due to the emission process ) whereas the level of polarisation for the stellar emission will vary considerably ( le queau 1987 ) .",
    "many extrasolar planets are in short period orbits , moving within the stellar corona of their host star , and we may expect some complicated magnetospheric geometries and interactions in such cases ( ip et al .",
    "on the other hand , any short period extrasolar planet may well be tidally locked , with a possible impact on the planetary dynamo ( griemeier et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "if we consider the case where the stellar wind is incident on the planetary magnetosphere then we can produce a scaling relationship relating the expected radio flux ( @xmath11 ) of the planet to the local physical conditions ( for a more detailed discussion see stevens 2005 , lazio et al .",
    "2004 and zarka et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) , such that    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the stellar mass - loss rate , @xmath14 is the stellar wind velocity incident on the planetary magnetosphere , @xmath15 is the planetary magnetic moment , @xmath16 is the orbital distance between the star and the planet , and @xmath17 the distance to the earth .",
    "we might expect the planetary magnetic moment to roughly scale with the planetary mass .",
    "for the solar system , this relation is known as blackett s law ( blackett 1947 ) .",
    "one form of blackett s law is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the planetary magnetic moment , @xmath20 the planetary mass , and @xmath21 the planetary angular rotation frequency .",
    "there are other forms of this relationship , such that @xmath22 but in general the more massive the planet , the more massive will be the planetary magnetic moment , resulting in a larger magnetosphere and enhanced radio emission . of course , these relations are based on the solar system and are not exact .",
    "we also have no evidence that they hold for exoplanetary systems but they allow us to make promising predictions .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "these gmrt observations have provided tight upper limits on the 150  mhz flux from two nearby , longer period extrasolar planets .",
    "in addition to these observations we can also add in vlss 74  mhz limits for these two objects . for @xmath3 eri",
    "this is approximately 0.9  jy and 1.2  jy for hd128311 .",
    "previous searches for extrasolar planets have focused on short period systems , but have also failed to detect anything .",
    "these observations complement and extend the range of extrasolar planetary systems that have been surveyed .",
    "our observations do not quite reach the expected radio flux of these systems .",
    "stevens ( 2005 ) suggests that the mean radio flux for @xmath3 eri b would be 2.4  mjy and 1.4  mjy for hd128311 b , of course these are only mean values and do not take account for the eccentricity of the system . in both cases",
    "we have observed the planet closer than at its mean position so we would expect the flux to increase .",
    "our flux limits do approach these values .",
    "there are several reasons why we have not detected these systems .",
    "1 .   insufficient sensitivity : one issue for longer period periods systems is that they are predicted to be intrinsically fainter than the shorter period systems , with the expected flux falling off as @xmath23 ( all other things being equal ) .",
    "clearly more sensitive observations are required .",
    "wrong frequency : the radio cut - off for jupiter is around 40  mhz , and it could be the case that 150  mhz is too high a frequency to detect the electron - cyclotron maser emission .",
    "the jovian cut - off is determined by the magnetic field strength near the planetary surface , and probably scales roughly linearly with planetary mass .",
    "consequently , we might expect to only detect planets with a mass of @xmath24 .",
    "the mass of @xmath3  eri  b ( @xmath25 ) is well constrained and is below this value . for hd128311",
    ", we have only lower limits for the planetary masses ( of 2.2 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "if the system inclination is less than @xmath27 then one of the planets will have a mass greater than this limit and if @xmath28 ( and the planets are co - planar ) then both will exceed this limit . while not guaranteed",
    ", there is a moderate chance that 150  mhz is an appropriate frequency for detection",
    ". clearly , simultaneous observations in a much wider frequency range is desirable , particularly at lower frequencies .",
    "wrong planetary orientation : in the case of the solar system planets the low frequency emission comes from a hollow cone with a wide opening angle ( @xmath29 half - width opening angle for jupiter ) . for jupiter",
    "the emission has an equivalent solid angle of 1.6 sterad ( zarka & cecconi 2004 ) .",
    "assuming this also applies to extrasolar planets then we would expect to see emission from a given extrasolar planet at some epoch .",
    "however , this does raise the related issue of time variability",
    ". it could be that we simply observed the systems at the wrong time .    to solve the problem of detecting the magnetospheric emission from extrasolar planets we can look forward to the low frequency array ( lofar ) .",
    "lofar is expected to operate in the frequency range of 10 - 240  mhz .",
    "the design goals suggest that a sensitivity , in a 15 minute integration with a 4  mhz bandwidth , of around 2  mjy will possible .",
    "several features of lofar make it a highly capable instrument for detecting extrasolar planets first , it has an appropriate frequency coverage , second it is more sensitive than current telescopes and thirdly its design means that it can survey large portions of the sky . in spite of our theoretical prejudices ,",
    "we really do not know which extrasolar planetary systems will turn out to be brightest , and the wide field capability of lofar will be more productive than the repeated pointed observations that have hitherto been done .",
    "we expect that extrasolar planetary radio emission will be detectable with lofar and comparable arrays , if produced in a manner similar to the solar system planets .    in summary",
    ", we have presented gmrt observations of two extrasolar planetary systems ( @xmath3 eri and hd128311 ) at 150  mhz .",
    "we have not detected either systems , but have provided tight upper limits on the low - frequency radio emission from the magnetospheres of these planets .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt who have made these observations possible .",
    "the gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
    "in particular we would like to thank ishwara chandra c. h. for his input during the observations and with the data analysis .",
