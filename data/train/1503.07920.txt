    "some theoretical approaches were taken into account to explain this phenomenon , we are interested in an universe in where exists an exotic energy component with negative pressure , named @xmath2 @xcite , and which presumably began to dominate the evolution of the universe , only recently . within this approach , the simplest candidate for @xmath2 is the cosmological constant @xmath5 , which has an eos parameter @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "also , there exist other alternative models such as phantom model @xcite , quintom model @xcite , quintessence model @xcite , the k - essence model @xcite , chaplyging gas model @xcite , massive scalar field model @xcite and other .",
    "all these models predict different dynamics of the universe .",
    "+ on the other hand , the properties of @xmath2 are mainly cha - racterized by @xmath3 .",
    "in such a way , due to our ignorance of its nature , it was parameterize empirically in a model independent way . in this sense , we have followed two ways to explore its behaviour .",
    "the first one was to paramete - rize @xmath3 in terms of some free parameters @xcite . among all the different parametrizations forms the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite is considered as the most popular ansatz @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the redshift and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are real parameters @xcite .",
    "this ansatz has a divergence problem , when redshift @xmath13 approaches to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in addition , some non - parametric forms were found in @xcite .",
    "the second one was to choose an appropiated local basis representation for @xmath3 and after estimate the associated coefficients @xcite .",
    "however , a divergence - free reconstruction for @xmath3 was proposed here , expanding @xmath3 in terms of the chebyshev polynomials @xmath17 . to display how the method runs",
    "@xmath3 was expanded in terms of only the first three chebyshev polynomials @xmath18 , and therefore , they are considered as a complete orthonormal basis on the finite interval @xmath19 $ ] , and besides , belong to the hilbert space @xmath20 of real values @xcite .",
    "they were chosen because have the property to be the minimal approximately polynomials @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , within the universe another dark component has been assumed its existence , so - called @xmath1 , which acts exactly like the ordinary matter ( pre - ssureless ) , but does not interact with @xmath2 , except gravi - tationally .",
    "the nature of these dark components are not still known and the possibility that within the universe exists a non - gravitational coupling in the dark sector could not be precluded , as well as , its possible effect on the dynamics evolution of the cosmological parameters should be considered @xcite .",
    "some consequences of it were already studied in @xcite , from which the strenght of the coupling should be very small . + a huge amount of coupled @xmath2 models",
    "have already been investigated and fitted with cosmological data .",
    "some of them were motivated by mathematical simplicity , for example , models in which @xmath21 , in where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the hubble parameter and the energy density of dark sectors , respectively .",
    "it has three possibilities , namely , @xmath24 ( @xmath1 energy density ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath2 energy density ) and @xmath26 @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the models with @xmath27 have been used in rehe - ating @xcite , curvaton decay @xcite and decay of @xmath1 into radiation @xcite .",
    "all these models strongly depend on the choice made for the @xmath0 form .",
    "so far , the coupled @xmath2 models have not been investigated , in a general form before . in effect , some attempt to reconstruct @xmath0 from a general parametrization has been done by us in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have considered different theoretical scenarios , in where @xmath3 was always taken as constant .",
    "here , we fixed @xmath28 , where the function @xmath29 was reconstructed in terms of the first six chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the analysis was done using a sample of snia union @xmath8 data .",
    "our main results showed that the best fitted on @xmath29 have prefered to cross the noncoupling line @xmath30 during its evolution .",
    "+ the motivation of this article has been to go from theory to observations , following the prescription outlines by cueva - nucamendi @xcite .",
    "then , to follow this thread , a coupled model with two reconstructions describing to @xmath0 and @xmath3 simultaneously has been proposed here .",
    "therefore , we have postulated the existence of a general non - gravitational coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite , introducing a general phenomenological parametrization for @xmath0 into the equations of motion of these dark components . here , @xmath0 was reconstructed expanding it in terms of the first three chebyshev polynomials @xmath18 .",
    "this has been the first attempt at reconstructing simultaneously @xmath0 and @xmath3 from real data . +",
    "two distinct coupled @xmath2 models such as xcpl and dr were analysed here . within these scenarios ,",
    "the aim of our paper has been to study the effects that result from the reconstructions of @xmath0 and @xmath3 on the cosmological background evolution , of some parameters such as ( defined below ) @xmath1 energy density parameter ( @xmath31 ) , deceleration parameter ( @xmath32 ) and jerk parameter ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , whose amplitudes are modified with respect to those of uncoupled models . here , our models were constrained using an analysis combined of union @xmath6 snia @xcite , bao @xcite , cmb @xcite , and h data sets @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we organize this paper as follows : the background equation of motions for the energy densities , the definition of the geometrical parameters , and the reconstruction schemes for @xmath0 and @xmath3 are derived in section ii . + in section iii",
    "we describe the coupled @xmath2 models worked .",
    "the priors considered and the observational constraints on the parameters space are discussed in section iv .",
    "we discuss our results in section v. in section vi we conclude our main results .",

    "the critical densities @xmath41 , and the critical density today @xmath42 , in where @xmath43 is the current value of the hubble parameter , were conveniently defined . considering that @xmath44 , then the normalized densities are @xmath45 the first friedmann equation is then given by @xmath46\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and with the following relation for all time @xmath47 the scale factor @xmath48 is related with the redshift through @xmath49 , from which find @xmath50 . by substituting this last relation into eqs.([eofb])-([eofde ] ) , and solving eqs.([eofb])-([eofr ] ) , find the redshift evolution of @xmath51 @xmath52 then , these equations have been fundamental to determine the results within our models .",
    "the geometrical parameters of the universe are obtained by performing a taylor series expansion of the scale factor @xmath53 around the current epoch , @xmath54 .",
    "conventionally , this series is truncated at a determined order @xcite .",
    "then , in this work we have been truncated such series at third order to study its behaviour , in where the dimensionless coefficients such as deceleration parameter , @xmath32 , and jerk parameter , @xmath4 , are defined as @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the second and third derivatives of @xmath48 with respect to time , respectively , and also , `` @xmath58 '' indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath13 .",

    "lisewise , within this scenario , a finite value for @xmath3 has been obtained from the past to the future , mainly , the asymptotic values are : @xmath189 for @xmath185 , @xmath190 for @xmath191 and @xmath190 for @xmath68 . therefore , a better physical description of the dynamical evolution of @xmath2 is performed by the dr model , which should be used to explore the properties of @xmath2 . + @xmath188 currently , a phase of accelerated expansion is the situa - tion revealed by all our models about the universe .",
    "the big - rip problem is not forecasted by the dr model , and hence , this scenario should be considered to study the ultimate destinity of the universe .",
    "likewise , from the coupled models found that the values of the amplitudes of the parameter @xmath32 are not significantly affected neither by values of @xmath163 nor by the values of @xmath3 ( see left above panel in figure [ geometricalq ] ) .",
    "+ @xmath188 the values of the amplitudes of @xmath180 ( see upper panels in figure [ omegas ] ) are not significantly modified by the recons - tructions of @xmath163 and @xmath3 , respectively , nevertheless , they are definitely positive .",
    "this requirement implies that @xmath3 must be always negative in all the cosmic stages of the universe ( see upper panels in figure [ iq ] ) .",
    "+ @xmath188 the coupled models are strongly favored by the observational data having a preference for @xmath192 , and hence , they represent a slight deviation from the value predicted by the @xmath5cdm model ( see table [ cosmological_state ] ) .",
    "+ @xmath188 the behaviours qualitatively presented here show that the graph of @xmath4 has more possibility in discriminating the different coupled @xmath2 models , and therefore , @xmath4 could be used to distinguish them ( see left upper panel in figure [ geometricalj ] ) .",
    "+ @xmath188 the physical effects generated by the magnitudes of @xmath163 and @xmath3 on the cosmological parameters could be understood , so : an energy transfer from @xmath2 to @xmath1 or vice versa inserts energy into one of the fluids , and determines an increase of the energy density on one of them , which increases the hubble parameter inducing a slight expansion of the universe , and to recover equilibrium of the system @xmath163 and @xmath3 leads to an enhancement or suppression on the amplitudes and shapes of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath4 with respect to uncoupled models , in determined redshift ranges .",
    "+ in a forthcoming paper we will extend our study by applying cosmological perturbation theory on the coupled models , using data of linear matter power spectrum , weak lensing potential , integrated sach - wolfe , growth rate , and other",
    ". they will allow us to calculate of how the magnitudes of @xmath163 and @xmath3 operate on the amplitudes of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "from which , we may conclude if our dr model can emerge as an alternative to the @xmath5cdm model",
    ". this will be the purpose of our future work .",
