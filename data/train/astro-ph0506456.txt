    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show strong , erratic brightness fluctuations in the x - ray band ( @xcite ) . at least for the seyfert galaxies ,",
    "the power spectrum of these variations is a power law - like continuum with a steep slope , except in a few cases where the slope can be seen to flatten at low frequencies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "processes with steep power spectra like this are known as _ red noise _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray variations in seyfert galaxies bear more than a passing resemblance to those of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to a relatively featureless red noise continuum , xrbs often show qpos in the form of peaks above the continuum ( red noise ) power spectrum . by analogy with xrbs",
    ", agn may also possess qpos .",
    "for example , assuming a @xmath0 scaling of frequencies we might expect to see analogues of the high frequency qpos of xrbs at @xmath1  hz @xcite .",
    "the detection of periodic or quasi - periodic variations from a seyfert galaxy would be a major discovery and could lead to a breakthrough in our understanding if the characteristic ( peak ) frequency could be identified with some physically meaningful frequency .",
    "one of the most popular tools for time series analysis in astronomy is the _ periodogram _ @xcite which is simply the modulus - squared of the discrete fourier transform of the time series ( with an appropriate normalisation ) .",
    "this measures the amount of variability _ power _ as a function of temporal frequency .",
    "a concentration of power in a narrow range of frequencies would indicate a qpo .",
    "the notorious problem with the periodogram of noise processes is that the ordinates are distributed like @xmath2 ( with two degrees of freedom ) about the true spectrum @xcite .",
    "this means there are large fluctuations in the periodogram that can easily be mistaken for genuine peaks ( periodic signals ) .",
    "tests for periodic variations against a background of white ( flat spectrum ) noise that take account of these intrinsic sampling fluctuations are well established : see @xcite or section 6.1.4 of @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . if the underlying source variability is not white noise the problem is more difficult and these methods will yield unreliable results ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "with non - imaging detectors ( e.g. _ exosat _ , _ ginga _ , _ rxte _ ) there is always the possibility the light curve of a particular agn is contaminated by other bright x - ray sources within the field of view .",
    "this possibility was realised in the case of ngc 6814 which had been identified as the best candidate for a seyfert galaxy with an x - ray period based on non - imaging _ exosat _ observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent x - ray imaging observations made with _ rosat _ showed the periodic oscillations belonged to another source ( v1432 aquilae , a cataclysmic variable ) located @xmath3  arcmin from ngc 6814 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible for systematic , periodic changes in the detector properties to artificially modulate the observed light curve .",
    "an example is the _ exosat _ data of ngc 5548 .",
    "@xcite reported significant periodicities in this moderate luminosity seyfert but a reanalysis of the same data by @xcite demonstrated that one observation was affected by detector problems .",
    "the likelihood of these problems is greatly reduced with the current generation of low - background , imaging x - ray missions .      since the days of _ exosat",
    "_ we have known that the x - ray variations of seyfert galaxies have an intrinsically red power spectrum .",
    "this means the periodogram is not flat in expectation ( as for white noise ) and is generally not known _",
    "a priori_. as a result it is meaningless to apply the standard ` periodogram peak ' tests ( @xcite ) .",
    "these all assume a null hypothesis of independent ( white ) , gaussian noise .",
    "thus a high rejection probability for the null hypothesis obtained from any of these tests merely rejects white noise as the sole origin of the variance .",
    "it does not reject the more likely possibility that there are intrinsic red noise variations in the light curve ( i.e. non - white , but also not periodic variations ) .",
    "even a slight amount of intrinsic red noise variance will raise the spectrum above the white noise expectation and lead to spurious detections .",
    "for example , @xcite discussed a possible periodicity in iras @xmath4 from a long ( @xmath5  day ) _ asca _ observation .",
    "the significance of the candidate periodicity was estimated by testing against the hypothesis of purely poisson noise . however , once the red noise variations intrinsic to the source were included in the periodogram fitting the candidate periodicity was no longer significant at the @xmath6 level ( @xcite ) .",
    "other seyfert galaxies for which candidate qpos were reported without rigorously testing an origin in red noise include rx j@xmath7 ( @xcite ) , mcg@xmath86 - 30 - 15 ( @xcite ) , mrk 766 ( @xcite ) and iras  @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are a number of ways that one can account for red noise in a light curve .",
    "but this is often not a trivial task and there are many possibilities for overestimating the significance of candidate qpos . for example , @xcite reported candidate qpos in ngc 4151 based on three _ exosat _ observations .",
    "the authors claimed high ( @xmath10 ) significance peaks in the periodograms after the data were `` pre - whitened '' by detrending the light curves using a parabola .",
    "however , no account was made of the uncertainties involved in this procedure , which would undoubtedly leave some residual red noise component in the spectrum .",
    "if the continuum power at low frequencies ( where the qpos occurred and where the red noise will be strongest ) was underestimated by only a small fraction this would drastically inflate the significance of the candidate qpos .",
    "figure  [ fig:4151 ] shows a re - analysis of one of these datasets .",
    "explicitly fitting the red noise and poisson noise components of the spectrum allows us to place more realistic limits on the significances of any qpos , which now fall below the @xmath6 confidence detection threshold .",
    "kev me data binned to @xmath11  s ( obtained through the _ exosat _ data archive at heasarc / gsfc ) .",
    "the histogram shows the raw data and the solid curve marks the maximum likelihood fit using a model comprising a power law ( red noise ) plus constant ( poisson noise ) .",
    "the dashed line represents a ( minimum ) @xmath6 confidence limit for the detection of a qpo calculated as a factor @xmath12 $ ] above the model , where @xmath13 is the number of frequencies and @xmath14 is the ` false alarm probability ' .",
    "this quick calculation slightly underestimates the threshold because it does not account for uncertainties in the modelling ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the arrow indicates the position of the candidate qpo discussed by @xcite .",
    "[ fig:4151 ] , width=6 ]    the above example is one where the uncertainty in modelling the aperiodic power spectrum ( i.e. the intrinsic red noise and instrumental poisson noise ) led to an artificially enhanced periodicity significance . in general ,",
    "not accounting for the uncertainty in the null hypothesis model ( the continuum ) often tends to overestimate the significance of any peaks in the residual ( `` whitened '' ) periodogram .",
    "for example , in their re - analysis of the _ exosat _ observations of ngc 5548 , @xcite found that in every case the significance of the candidate qpo was lower than previously reported ( @xmath15% ) once due allowance was made for the uncertainties in modelling the spectrum .",
    "it is also possible to overestimate the significance of a periodogram peak when the periodogram is oversampled .",
    "@xcite identified possible qpos in three seyfert 1 galaxies ( ton s180 , rx j@xmath7 , 1h 0419 - 577 ) based on a uniform analysis of all the available long _ euve _ observations .",
    "the significances of the periodicities were estimated using a monte carlo procedure similar to that discussed by @xcite . however , the periodograms were oversampled ( computed at frequencies between , as well as at , the standard fourier frequencies ) .",
    "this increases the number of frequencies searched and therefore also the chance of seeing a spurious signal ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally there are cases where genuinely significant power spectral features have been detected but were not caused by periodic oscillations .",
    "@xcite reported a broad bump in the power spectrum of ngc 4051 ( based on _ exosat _ observations ) .",
    "however , recent observations with _ rosat , rxte _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( @xcite ) have provided much tighter constraints on the power spectrum and have shown that the underlying continuum spectrum of ngc 4051 breaks at a similar frequency to that reported by @xcite .",
    "the broad bump in the spectrum reported from the _ exosat _ observation is therefore likely to be due to the break in the continuum spectrum rather than an additional qpo feature .",
    "a major source of ` false alarm ' qpos is the use of an inappropriate continuum power spectrum . arbitrarily assuming a white noise spectrum , or red noise with an _ ad hoc _ slope ,",
    "will alter the apparent strength ( significance ) of any peaks in the residual periodogram .",
    "the continuum spectrum must be modelled explicitly .",
    "furthermore , one must account for uncertainties in the continuum modelling .",
    "failure to include these may result in an overly optimistic significance calculation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the above arguments apply not only to searching for peaks in the periodogram but also for searches based on _ epoch folding _ , whereby one bins the time series into phase bins at a test period . at the correct period the periodic variations will sum while any background noise will cancel out , thus revealing the profile of the periodic pulsations",
    ". however , the background noise will only cancel out if it is temporally independent , i.e. white noise .",
    "again , the presence of any underlying red noise variations will produce unreliable results unless checked with e.g. monte carlo simulations ( @xcite ) .",
