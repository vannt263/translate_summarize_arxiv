    "integrable models , in particular , spin chains , appear in several problems of high energy physics as effective models of interaction . for example , the hamiltonian of the xxx spin chain with the non  compact representation of spin @xmath10 arises in description of scattering of hadrons at high energies  @xcite , and also in description of mixing of composite operators under renormalization in qcd  @xcite .",
    "mixing of composite operators under renormalization in the super  symmetric yang ",
    "mills theory also gives rise to an xxx  chain but with a compact representation .",
    "in this theory , one considers locally invariant operators of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two complex scalar fields from the supermultiplet .",
    "the conformal dimensions @xmath14 of this operators comprise the spectrum of the dilatation operator  @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to describe mixing of operators ( [ zw ] ) under renormalization with the help of an analogy with the quantum spin chain of length @xmath16 , where each occurrence of @xmath12 is represented by a spin up , and each occurrence of @xmath13 is is represented by a spin down .",
    "for example , the state @xmath17 corresponds to the following spin chain @xmath18 .",
    "an important observation made in @xcite was that , in the @xmath0sector of the theory in the one  loop approximation ( i.e. , in the first order in @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the yang  mills coupling constant , and @xmath21 is the number of colours ) the dilatation operator @xmath15 can be expressed via the xxx hamiltonian of spin @xmath22 for the described above chain : @xmath23 therefore , determining the spectrum of @xmath15 in this approximation is reduced to investigating the bethe equations for the heisenberg magnet ( see @xcite ) , @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the rapidities of elementary excitations .",
    "the high  loop corrections to ( [ dx ] ) were found in articles that followed @xcite , and there it was shown that the corresponding expressions are also integrable hamiltonians for the spin chain ( those that include interaction between several nearest sites ) . in these approximations , the spectrum of @xmath15 is determined not by equations ( [ bethe_eq0 ] ) but by their `` deformations '' which explicitely contain the parameter @xmath26 in the left  hand side .",
    "assuming that integrability of @xmath15 takes place in all orders , beisert , dippel , and staudacher @xcite argued that the exact bethe equations determining the spectrum of @xmath15 look like following @xmath27 where @xmath28    for the spin chain of length @xmath29 , the spectrum of the hamiltonian is bounded by the energies of the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic vacua .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of the operator @xmath15 , i.e. the dimensions of operators ( [ zw ] ) , belongs to the interval @xmath30    the lower bound here follows obviously from the structure of the antiferromagnetic vacuum ( all spins up ) , whereas determining the upper bound requires a non  trivial evaluation of the energy of the antiferromagnetic vacuum .",
    "the value of @xmath31 in the thermodynamic limit was found in @xcite and @xcite by means of the standard technique of passing to the limit @xmath32 in the bethe equations . in this procedure",
    "it was assumed that , like for equations ( [ bethe_eq0 ] ) , the antiferromagnetic vacuum is formed of strings of length  1 , i.e. , real roots of equations  ( [ bethe_eq ] ) .",
    "however , the example of the xxx spin chain of higher spin [ 11,12 ] shows that the antiferromagnetic vacuum for bethe equations whose left ",
    "hand side differs from ( [ bethe_eq0 ] ) can have other structure , for instance , it can be filled by strings of greater length .",
    "the aim of the present work is to prove existence of solutions corresponding to strings of length greater than  1 for the equations ( [ bethe_eq ] ) in the thermodynamic limit and to check validity of the assumption about the structure of the antiferromagnetic vacuum .",
    "to make from @xmath33 an analytic single  valued function , we fix in @xmath34 the cut @xmath35 $ ] and define @xmath33 on @xmath36 $ ] as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39{-}\\pi,\\pi]$ ] are determined from the relations @xmath40 .",
    "notice that the signs of the imaginary parts of @xmath41 and @xmath33 coincide , that is @xmath33 maps a point from the upper / lower half  plane to the upper / lower half  plane , respectively .    let us prove that the following relations @xmath42 hold for every @xmath43 .",
    "let us denote @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "it follows from ( 7 ) that @xmath48 is a function continuous in @xmath41 ( in particular , even when @xmath41 crosses the cut ) , and @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , with @xmath50 being fixed , the function @xmath51 is continuous and symmetric in  @xmath52 .",
    "we will prove that this function is convex , of which ( 8) will then be an obvious consequence .",
    "it follows from ( 5 ) that the function inverse to @xmath33 is given by @xmath53 .",
    "whence it is easy to derive the following relations @xmath54 let @xmath55 denote the partial derivative w.r.t  @xmath52 ( i.e. @xmath56 ) . applying it to ( 9 ) and solving the system of equations for @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ", we find @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "whence we obtain @xmath61 due to the remark made after equation ( 7 ) , @xmath52 and @xmath62 are of the same sign .",
    "therefore , expression ( 11 ) is positive / negative in the upper / lower half  plane , respectively .",
    "hence @xmath48 is convex in @xmath63 , which completes the proof of  ( 8) .",
    "relations ( 8) allow us to adapt the analysis of complex roots of equations ( 3 ) ( see  [ 5,7 ] ) to the case of equations  ( 4 ) .",
    "namely , it follows from ( 8) that , in the @xmath64 limit , the absolute value of the l.h.s . of ( 4 ) tends to @xmath65 when @xmath66 and to @xmath67 when @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that r.h.s .",
    "has , respectively , a pole or a zero , i.e. there must exist also the root @xmath69 in the first case and the root @xmath70 in the second case .",
    "thus , like in case of the xxx magnet , roots of equations ( 4 ) group in the thermodynamic limit into `` strings '' which are complexes of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "now we will investigate what state has the maximal energy in the case when the vacuum is filled with strings of length @xmath74 , where @xmath3 is integer .",
    "the number of these strings @xmath75 is fixed by the condition @xmath76 . following [ 57 ]",
    ", we multiply bethe equations ( 4 ) along a string of length @xmath74 . since the right  hand side of these equations is the same as in the `` undeformed '' bethe equations , strings will have the same form , i.e. @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "further , considering the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath64 ) , we obtain that the centers of strings are arranged along the real axis with some density which satisfies certain integral equation .",
    "having found this density , one can compute the energy of the ground state ( see  [ 5,6 ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain the following equation for the centers of strings : @xmath79 where @xmath80      to prove the uniqueness of a solution to equations ( 12 ) for a given set of integer numbers @xmath81 , we will use the yang s action . as in the case of the xxx magnet @xcite",
    ", there exists a functional @xmath82 ( called yang s action ) such that equations ( 12 ) are the conditions of its extremum , @xmath83 .",
    "let us consider the quadratic form for the matrix of second derivatives of  @xmath82 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "it is obvious that the second term is always positive .",
    "let us prove the positivity of the first one : @xmath86 here we used the same notation as in section  2 and applied the cauchy equations for derivatives of an analytic function .",
    "relation ( 11 ) shows that ( 15 ) is positive for @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the quadratic form ( 14 ) is positive definite and , consequently , the action @xmath82 has a unique minimum .",
    "let us go to the thermodynamic limit now .",
    "taking @xmath88 and differentiating ( 12 ) with respect to @xmath41 , we obtain for the left ",
    "hand side : @xmath89 now we introduce the root density @xmath90 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath90 plays the role of density of numbers @xmath93 on the interval  @xmath94 .",
    "having introduced this density , we can rewrite the l.h.s . of ( 12 ) as follows @xmath95.\\ ] ] this integral equation can be solved by means of the fourier transform . to this end",
    "we compute first @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "thus , after the fourier transform , the left ",
    "hand side of our integral equation acquires the following form @xmath98 = \\pi \\operatorname{\\mathrm{e}}^{-\\frac{2n+1}{2}|k| } j_0(\\chi k ) \\ , .",
    "\\ ] ] on the r.h.s .",
    "the fourier integral is divided into the following terms @xmath99 where @xmath100 stands for the fourier transform of the density  @xmath90 .",
    "these terms can be summed up : @xmath101    as a result , we obtain the following expression for the fourier transformed density @xmath100 : @xmath102 this yields the solution of the integral equation , @xmath103 for @xmath104 ( i.e. strings of length  1 ) this expression coincides with the expression for the density that was obtained in  [ 9 , 10 ] .",
    "now we will compute the energy ( or , equivalently , the maximal dimension of the dilatation operator @xmath105 ) for the state filled with strings of length @xmath74 , where @xmath3 is integer .",
    "the dispersion in the considered theory differs from that of the xxx magnet , the corresponding energy density is given by  [ 9 ] @xmath106    substituting here the expression ( 24 ) for the density , we obtain : @xmath107 here we used the following relation : @xmath108.\\ ] ] below we provide a plot which shows how the second term in ( 26 ) depends on @xmath3 for a fixed value of  @xmath26 .",
    "it is apparent that the maximum of the integral ( and thus the maximum of @xmath105 ) is attained at  @xmath104 . in the appendix",
    "we give a strict proof that @xmath105 decreases monotonously as @xmath3 grows .",
    "thus , we conclude that the state with maximal energy in the sector of strings of odd length indeed corresponds to strings of length  1 , as it was assumed in  [ 9 , 10 ] .",
    "however , in the next section we will show that the real anti ",
    "ferromagnetic vacuum might have a more complicated structure and possibly corresponds to strings of length  2 .",
    "unlike the absolute value @xmath48 , the phase of @xmath33 is not a continuous function .",
    "its value changes by a finite amount when @xmath41 crosses the cut .",
    "using ( 7 ) it is easy to derive that for @xmath109 $ ] we have the following relation : @xmath110 where @xmath111 if @xmath112 tends to the zero from the right and @xmath113 if @xmath112 tends to the zero from the left .    for a chain of a large but finite length @xmath29 , the roots of bethe equations group into strings only up to exponential deviations : @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is integer or half  integer and @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "the total energy of a string is given by @xmath118 .",
    "computing this expression for a string of even length and taking relation ( 28 ) into account , we observe that the roots @xmath119 give additional contributions , @xmath120 it is important to remark here that , for the regime corresponding to @xmath121 , the first two terms in ( 30 ) give a negative contribution to  @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that in this regime @xmath122 is positive not everywhere on the real axis . as a consequence , the anti ",
    "ferromagnet vacuum in this case has a more complicated structure  it has to be filled with strings only in the intervals where @xmath123 . in the present work we will consider only the regime corresponding to @xmath113 . let us remark that in this case the proof of convexity of the yang s action given in section  3.2 remains valid .",
    "taking product of the left hand sides of the bethe equations ( 4 ) along a string of even length and taking into account the additional contributions due to the roots ( 29 ) , we find that the l.h.s . of the equation for the centers of strings",
    "looks like following @xmath124 taking logarithm of this expression , we obtain equations  ( 12 ) but with an additional term on the left hand side . differentiating ( 28 )",
    "@xmath41 , then making the fourier transformation , @xmath125=   - 2i \\ , \\nu_\\epsilon\\ ,   \\int_{-\\chi}^{\\chi } \\ ,",
    "\\frac{e^{iku } \\,du}{\\sqrt{\\chi^2-u^2 } }   = - 2\\pi i \\ , \\nu_\\epsilon\\ , j_0(\\chi k ) , \\ ] ] and comparing with formula ( 19 ) , we see that , for strings of even length in the regime @xmath113 , equation ( 20 ) acquires the following form @xmath126 = \\pi \\bigl ( e^{-\\frac{2n+1}{2}|k| }   + 1 \\bigr )   j_0 ( \\chi k ) .\\ ] ] repeating now the computation of the fourier image of the density as was done in section  3.3 , we find @xmath127    formula ( 33 ) shows that the additional contributions from the roots ( 29 ) yield the same effect as if the vacuum were filled with mixture of strings of length @xmath2 and strings of length @xmath67 ( which formally corresponds to @xmath128 ) . in this context",
    "we remark that expressions of the type ( 31 ) appear in the left hand sides of bethe equations for chains with alternating spins ( see , e.g.  [ 13 , 14 ] ) .",
    "formula ( 30 ) implies that , in order to compute the total energy of the chain , we have to replace ( 25 ) with @xmath129 substituting here ( 34 ) and making the same computation in the section  3.4 , we obtain @xmath130 using the method described in the appendix , one can show that for @xmath131 expression ( 36 ) decreases monotonously as @xmath3 grows .",
    "the maximal value of ( 36 ) at @xmath132 is given by @xmath133 in order to compare this expression with the value of @xmath134 corresponding to strings of length  1 , one can subtract the value of ( 26 ) for @xmath104 from  ( 37 ) .",
    "the resulting expression has the form of the integral in ( 38)with monotonously decreasing in @xmath135 function  @xmath136 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , such an integral is positive .",
    "thus , filling the vacuum with strings of length  2 in the regime @xmath113 yields larger value for @xmath134 than filling it with strings of length  1 .",
    "however , what regime is indeed realized for string of even length in the thermodynamic limit , remains at present an open question .",
    "its resolution requires quite subtle analysis of the exponential corrections @xmath112 in ( 29 ) for  @xmath32 .",
    "let us denote @xmath137 , @xmath138 and make in ( 26 ) a substitution @xmath139 .",
    "then @xmath140 where @xmath141 in this form , it is evident that @xmath136 decreases monotonously as  @xmath135 grows for all @xmath142 and @xmath143 . using this",
    "we will show that the integral in ( 38 ) is positive .",
    "let @xmath144 be the ordered set of roots of @xmath145 , and @xmath146 be the ordered set of roots of @xmath147 .",
    "it follows from the relation @xmath148 that @xmath149 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath150 is positive on @xmath151t_{2n},t_{2n+1}[$ ] and negative on @xmath151t_{2n+1},t_{2n+2}[$ ] , and the function @xmath136 is positive and monotonously decreasing for all @xmath152 , we obtain the following estimate : @xmath153   = \\frac12 \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\bigl [ f(t_{2n+1 } )   \\ , \\bigl (   j^2_0 ( t_{2n } ) - j^2_0(t_{2n+2 } ) \\bigr ) \\bigr ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last equality we used relation  ( 40 ) .",
    "now , since roots of @xmath147 are the points of local extrema for @xmath145 , and the values of @xmath154 at these points form a decreasing sequence , we conclude that the sum on the r.h.s . of ( 41 ) and hence the initial integral are positive .",
    "thus , @xmath155 , which implies that @xmath134 decreases monotonously as  @xmath3 grows .    *",
