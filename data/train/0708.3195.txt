    "neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) accrete matter from their low mass companions via roche lobe overflow .",
    "nearly half of these systems show type i x - ray bursts , thermonuclear flashes caused by rapid unstable burning of the accumulating hydrogen or helium after it settles and is compressed on the neutron star surface .",
    "a typical x - ray burst light curve has a rapid rise ( less than 10 s ) , followed by a longer decaying tail persisting for seconds to minutes as the star s surface cools .    the basic properties of type i x - ray bursts can be understood in terms of the stability of hydrogen and helium burning at different accretion rates @xcite .",
    "the boundaries between the different burning regimes depend on the local accretion rate @xmath0 ( accretion rate per unit area ) . below a critical accretion rate @xmath1% of the eddington rate @xmath2 , bursts are triggered by",
    "unstable hydrogen burning . above this level ,",
    "hydrogen burns stably via the hot cno cycle , and bursts are triggered by unstable helium burning once a critical column depth is reached . for @xmath3 but below a second critical rate @xmath4 ,",
    "expected to be a few percent of @xmath2 , the hydrogen at ignition depth should burn before helium ignition , leading to a pure helium flash . at higher accretion rates , @xmath5",
    ", hydrogen does not burn completely before the burst is triggered , leading to various classes of mixed h / he bursts .",
    "bursting activity will cease when the accretion rate is sufficiently high , @xmath6 , that helium burning is also stable .",
    "the precise levels of the critical accretion rates @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are not known precisely and will vary depending on factors such as the metallicity of the accreted material and the heat flux from the deep crust and core @xcite .",
    "there is now observational evidence for bursts in all three classes .",
    "the global accretion rate @xmath9 can be inferred from the x - ray luminosity , and this should ( under the assumption that accretion is spherically symmetric ) predict @xmath0 and hence the burning regime .",
    "furthermore , within a given burning regime , burst rate should rise with accretion rate . for a large number of sources ,",
    "however , these expectations are not borne out .",
    "transition accretion rates can differ from the predicted values by up to an order of magnitude , and for many sources burst rate actually falls as @xmath9 increases @xcite .",
    "why this should be the case is not yet clear but it may involve either additional stable burning processes @xcite or non - spherical accretion and slow fuel spread ( so that local accretion rate @xmath0 differs from that inferred from @xmath9 ) @xcite . alternatively it may well be that x - ray luminosity is not a good predictor of accretion rate @xcite . for a more in - depth discussion of these issues and other burst properties",
    "we refer the reader to the recent articles by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on one particular aspect of burst physics - the properties of the burst rise . the shape and time scale of the rising portion of the x - ray light curve",
    "is controlled by several factors : the point at which the burning layer ignites , the emission profile of any burning point after ignition ( set by the nuclear heating and cooling time scales ) ; and the speed at which the burning front propagates across the stellar surface .",
    "ignition is likely to occur at a point and spread , rather than occurring across the whole star simultaneously , because of the discrepancy between the very short burning time scales and the much longer accretion time scale @xcite .",
    "asymmetric initialization is also thought necessary to explain the detection during the rise of burst oscillations , variations in brightness on the surface of the neutron star that are modulated by the rapid stellar spin @xcite .    on a realistic neutron star ,",
    "ignition location is unlikely to be random due to the various factors that break spherical symmetry .",
    "accretion flow may not be spherically symmetric - it may occur through an equatorial boundary layer @xcite or by channeling onto the magnetic poles ( in which case the star may manifest as an x - ray pulsar ) . whether either of these issues can affect local ignition conditions or lead to preferred ignition locations",
    "is not clear , since estimates suggest that fuel should spread rapidly across the stellar surface between bursts .",
    "another factor that will certainly have an impact is stellar rotation .",
    "most of the neutron stars that show type i x - ray bursts are thought to be rapidly rotating , which reduces the effective gravity at the equator .",
    "centrifugal effects , coupled with the deformation of the neutron star due to the rapid rotation , combine to reduce the effective gravity at the equator as compared to the poles .",
    "this results in a local accretion rate that is higher at the equator @xcite .",
    "the column depth required for ignition is achieved more rapidly , and ignition should occur preferentially at this latitude .",
    "in fact there are accretion rates where off - equator ignition is still expected .",
    "@xcite considered the situation at high accretion rates @xmath10 where helium burning is on the verge of stability .",
    "there will be a range of accretion rates ( the more rapid the rotation , the larger this range ) where @xmath6 at the equator but not at other latitudes .",
    "although not discussed by @xcite , a similar region of off - equator ignition is to be expected at @xmath11 ( the transition to stable hydrogen burning ) .    once ignition has occurred , the nuclear burning processes determine the emission from a given point .",
    "the burning layer will expand during a convective phase , and there is a delay before radiative processes take over and the light curve starts to rise .",
    "light curves from a single point ( ignoring spreading effects ) have been generated by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the shape , time scales and strength of the single point light curve can vary substantially depending on factors such as the burning regime and the composition of the accreted material .",
    "there are as yet no simple analytic models for this process that take into account all of the relevant parameters .    at the accretion rates of relevance to most burst sources",
    ", the burning front is expected to propagate by deflagration @xcite rather than by detonation @xcite . in the simplest picture , spreading speed is set by the rate at which heat is transported across the burning front ( by convective processes ) . @xcite",
    "have since shown that rapid rotation will also play a significant role : interaction between the uplift ( vertical expansion ) of burning material and a strong coriolis force can act to slow spreading .",
    "the degree of asymmetry in the spread of the burning front is also relevant to the detectability of burst oscillations in the rise , if they are caused by a growing hot spot .    in this paper",
    "we attempt the first systematic examination of how these various factors interact to affect the shape and time scale of the rising portion of the light curve .",
    "previous studies in this area have focused on small samples of bursts such as the rare multi peaked bursts @xcite , or bursts from the accreting millisecond pulsars @xcite . in this study",
    "we adopt a much broader remit , motivated by the wide variety of shapes exhibited by the bursts of the lmxb 4u 1636 - 536 .",
    "this particular source is an excellent candidate for this type of study : there are over 120 bursts from this source in the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) archive , and it lies in a binary with relatively well - constrained properties . by comparing the burst properties with the results of parameterized simulations , we show that simple measures of the burst shape can be profound diagnostics of ignition latitude and burning regime .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ obs ]",
    "we define simple measures of burst morphology and classify the bursts of 4u 1636 - 536 accordingly .",
    "section [ sims ] gives details of the parameterized simulations that we carried out to generate model light curves , and looks at the effects on shape using the same simple measures . in section [ disc ]",
    "we compare the results of our simulations with the data , and consider the implications in terms of ignition point and burning regime .",
    "we present a model that can explain our results ( subject to the assumptions inherent in our simulations ) , and extend our analysis to other sources to test its feasibility .",
    "we conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "the bursting lmxb 4u 1636 - 536 is a persistent atoll source at a distance of @xmath12 kpc @xcite in a 3.8 hour binary orbit with a low mass blue star , v801 ara .",
    "the binary inclination @xmath13 is in the range @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the bursts have been studied extensively with both exosat @xcite and rxte @xcite .",
    "burst oscillations at 581 hz are seen in both normal bursts and superbursts , the latter being longer bursts triggered by unstable carbon burning @xcite .",
    "we include in our study all of the bursts covered by the rxte burst catalogue @xcite .",
    "the catalogue includes over 1000 bursts observed by the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) from december 30th 1995 to october 29th 2005 , 123 of which originate from 4u 1636 - 536 .    in order to study the shape and time scales of the bursts",
    "rises we started by constructing light curves from the pca data , using standard 1 data ( 0.125 s resolution ) and using all available energy channels . for most of the bursts this results in a smooth and monotonically increasing light curve . for a small group of bursts with peak fluxes below @xmath15 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath17 ( bursts 11 , 67 , 71 , 76 , 78 , 87 , 88 , 91 , 118 and 122 for this source , using the numbering system of @xcite ) ,",
    "the light curve is not smooth , so we exclude these bursts from our analysis .",
    "burst 117 is also excluded because the rise is truncated .",
    "we also exclude for the moment bursts that are either kinked or multi - peaked when plotted on a coarser ( 0.5s ) time resolution : that is to say bursts where the gradient of the lightcurve drops to zero or below during the rise .",
    "this group includes the strongly multi - peaked bursts ( 40 , 48 , 56 and 111 ) identified as such by @xcite as well as a group that are either kinked or weakly multi - peaked ( bursts 5 , 18 , 90 , 110 and 113 ) , see figure [ kinked ] .",
    "we will discuss these bursts in more detail in section [ disc ] .        in analyzing the light curves of the remaining 103 bursts we considered several different ways of quantifying the shape .",
    "the measure that we found to be most powerful , which we call convexity ( @xmath18 ) , measures the degree to which the light curve is concave or convex .",
    "the physical significance of this parameter will become clear in section [ sims ] , where we find that it can be used to diagnose the latitude at which the burst ignites .",
    "convexity @xmath18 is calculated as follows .",
    "we define the burst rise to be the interval where the count rate rises from 10 to 90 percent of the maximum count rate ( corrected for the pre - burst persistent emission ) .",
    "we define rise time @xmath19 as the duration of that interval . in order to compare the shape of bursts of different durations and peak count rates",
    "we then normalize both quantities so that they rise from 0 to 10 in dimensionless units .",
    "this process is illustrated in figures [ f3 ] and [ normalized ] .",
    "taking @xmath20 as the re - normalized count rate in each bin , and @xmath21 as the identity function ( shown as a diagonal line in figure [ normalized ] ) , we define convexity @xmath18 as    @xmath22    where n is the number of re - normalized time bins and @xmath23 is the re - normalized time bin size .",
    "convexity is effectively the integrated area of the curve above or below the diagonal line - areas above the line being positive and areas below negative . for highly convex bursts , where most points lie above the diagonal , @xmath18 is positive , and for highly concave bursts it is negative .",
    "our choice of re - normalization means that @xmath18 lies in the range -50 to 50 .        .",
    "as before , the left panel shows burst 1 , and the right panel burst 52 .",
    "convexity @xmath18 , defined in equation ( [ conv ] ) , is the integrated area above or below the diagonal dashed lines , with areas above the line ( convex bursts ) taken to be positive and areas below the line ( concave bursts ) negative . for burst 1",

    "for convenience in later discussions we also split the low peak flux bursts into two groups depending on whether convexity is positive or negative .",
    "only three bursts ( those in the upper left quadrant ) sit outside this simple grouping . for these we use the presence or absence of radius expansion to determine group membership : group",
    "3 bursts show radius expansion while those in group 1 do not .",
    "the lower dotted line shows the minimum peak flux for which we calculate convexity ( @xmath26 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath27).,width=340 ]    figure [ f1 ] plots the peak flux @xmath28 of the bursts against convexity . at high peak fluxes",
    "almost all of the bursts have @xmath29 , whereas at low peak fluxes we find equal numbers of bursts with both positive and negative convexities . for convenience in later discussions ,",
    "we assign the bursts to three broad groups , as indicated in the figure .",
    "bursts with @xmath30 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath17 are assigned to group 1 ( @xmath31 ) or group 2 ( @xmath32 ) , while the bright photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts with @xmath33 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath17 form group 3 .",
    "there are no pre bursts in group 1 , and only one in group 2 .",
    "figures [ f2 ] and [ szrisetime ] show the relationship between accretion rate and burst rise time @xmath19 for the bursts .",
    "@xcite give two parameters that can be used to estimate the accretion rate at the time of the burst .",
    "the first , the normalized persistent flux @xmath34 , is the ratio of the persistent x - ray flux to the eddington flux .",
    "this is thought to be a reasonable estimate of the global accretion rate @xmath9 as a fraction of the eddington rate @xmath35 .",
    "the second measure , @xmath36 , measures position in a colour - colour diagram : @xmath36 is thought to increase as accretion rate rises . both measures show the same trend . the bursts in groups 1 and 2 cluster at low accretion rates ( a few percent of eddington ) and have longer rise times than those in group 3 .",
    "the group 3 bursts have short rise times and dominate at higher accretion rates .",
    "( as a fraction of the eddington rate , taken from @xcite ) against rise time @xmath19 for the 4u 1636 - 536 bursts .",
    "groups 1 and 2 cluster in the range @xmath37 .",
    "group 3 bursts are seen at all values of @xmath34 and dominate at higher @xmath34 .",
    "groups 1 and 2 have longer rise times than group 3 ( for which @xmath38 s ) .",
    "there are only four group 1/2 bursts at @xmath39 .",
    "two ( partly obscured ) have @xmath40 .",
    "the group 2 burst at @xmath41 is burst 16 , one of the anomalous pre bursts identified in @xcite ( the other , burst 18 , is kinked and is not included on this plot ) .",
    "the group 1 burst at the highest @xmath34 is burst 19 : the burst rise shape is unusual , being almost kinked.,width=340 ]     @xcite against rise time .",
    "groups 1 and 2 dominate at lower @xmath36 , while group 3 dominates at higher values.,width=340 ]    table [ bprops ] summarizes the mean properties of the three groups of bursts .",
    "in addition to the parameters previously defined , we include burst fluence @xmath42 ( the integrated flux during the whole burst ) and the burst time scale @xmath43 ( the ratio of burst fluence to peak flux ) , using data from @xcite .",
    "group 3 bursts have higher fluences and shorter time scales , whereas properties for groups 1 and 2 are similar .",
    "we also indicate the percentage of bursts in each group for which @xcite state that oscillations are detected during the burst rise phase .",
    "oscillations are far more prevalent in group 3 than in groups 1 and 2 , as previously noted for this source by @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the picture that emerges is certainly not clear - cut .",
    "all but one of the sources ( 4u 1702 - 429 ) show some negative convexity bursts , and many of these sit on what we might interpret as the lower horizontal stroke of the f diagram .",
    "4u 1746 - 37 is interesting in that it seems to trace out the entire upper portion of the f diagram , with two negative convexity bursts at high accretion rates that might be polar ignition bursts triggered by he burning .",
    "there are however a few negative convexity bursts at intermediate accretion rates ( as there were for 4u 1636 - 536 ) .",
    "exo 0748 - 676 has a large percentage of negative convexity bursts : if these are caused by polar ignition then this may seem a little surprising , since this source is thought to have a much slower spin rate .",
    "this source does span a very narrow of accretion rates , however , and as a high inclination system we also expect the south pole ignition bursts to have negative convexities .",
    "however , if the accretion rate is not extremely finely - tuned , then there may be some other factor ( such a strong magnetic field ) that is controlling fuel deposition and hence ignition latitude .",
    "the relatively slow spin inferred for this source suggests that magnetic field effects might be important . in this respect",
    "the results from the pulsar ( xte j1814 - 338 ) are also extremely interesting .",
    "this source too shows a large number of negative convexity bursts , as one might expect if ignition were occurring off - equator at the magnetic pole .",
    "the phase - locking of persistent pulsations and burst oscillations in this source also suggests that this may be the case @xcite .",
    "we have shown , using parameterized simulations , that burst rise shape can be a valuable diagnostic of the burning process .",
    "changes in ignition latitude , in particular , can have a major impact on burst morphology , and such changes may explain the variation in burst rise shape seen in the well - studied source 4u 1636 - 536 .",
    "we have argued that a change from off - equatorial to equatorial ignition might be the hallmark of the transition from h triggered mixed bursts to he triggered bursts at low accretion rates .",
    "such a model can also plausibly explain variations in the detectability of burst oscillations .",
    "there are also areas , however , where additional physics is clearly required .",
    "our spreading and burning models were not , for example , able to generate multi - peaked or kinked burst rises .",
    "our goal with this work was to develop a simple phenomenological model to study the interactions between the various processes operating during the burst rise , and their influence on lightcurve shape .",
    "what we have done is clearly simplistic : the various elements of the model will be more closely connected than we have considered here , and we have made a number of assumptions that may not be valid .",
    "the parameter space that we have considered , however , is extremely wide , giving us confidence in our conclusions .",
    "what we have done also demonstrates the power of simple measures of the burst shape : if our model is valid we have been able to identify ignition latitude and rule out latitude - independent flame spreading speeds , for example ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this type of study could and should be repeated as more detailed models of the nuclear burning , spreading and emission process become available .",
    "we would like to thank edward brown , randall cooper , andrew cumming , fang peng , mike revnivtsev , henk spruit and rashid sunyaev and the anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research centre ( heasarc ) provided by nasa s goddard space flight centre .",
