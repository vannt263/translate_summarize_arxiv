    "importance of neutrons in grbs was realized recently ( derishev , kocharovsky , & kocharovsky 1999a , b ; bahcall & mszros 2000 ; mszros & rees 2000 ; fuller , pruet , & abazajian 2000 ; pruet & dalal 2002 ; beloborodov 2003a , b ) .",
    "their presence is inevitable in a standard fireball ( sections 2 and 3 ) and they qualitatively change the explosion picture at radii of @xmath1  cm ( section  4 ) .",
    "grb central engines are very dense and hot ( e.g. mszros 2002 ) .",
    "the central matter ( or matter surrounding the central black hole ) is filled with hot @xmath2 pairs in thermodynamic equilibrium with blackbody radiation at a temperature @xmath3  mev .",
    "its baryonic component is made of neutrons and protons ( nuclei break up into free nucleons in the unshadowed region of the @xmath4 plane shown in left panel of fig .  1 ) and frequent @xmath2 captures on nucleons take place , @xmath5 these reactions quickly convert protons to neutrons and back , and establish an equilibrium proton fraction @xmath6 which is shown in figure  1 .",
    "any plausible grb engines belong to the @xmath4 region where @xmath7 .",
    "so , the neutrons are not only present in the central engines  in fact , they dominate .",
    "when the neutronized matter is ejected into a high - entropy fireball , it remains neutron - dominated because ( 1 ) expansion occurs too fast and @xmath8 freezes out at its initial value below 0.5 , or ( 2 ) the fireball partially absorbs the neutrino flux from the engine , which tends to keep @xmath7 ( see beloborodov 2003a for details ) .",
    "as the fireball expands and cools , nucleons tend to recombine into @xmath9-particles ( like they do in the big bang ) .",
    "this process competes , however , with rapid expansion and can freeze out . for this reason",
    ", nucleosynthesis is suppressed in fireballs with a high photon - to - baryon ratio @xmath10 ( or , equivalently , high entropy per baryon @xmath11 ) .",
    "a minimum @xmath12 in grbs is @xmath13 , which is just marginal for nucleosynthesis ( detailed calculations of nucleosynthesis in grbs have been done recently by lemoine 2002 ; pruet , guiles , & fuller 2002 ; beloborodov 2003a ) . even in the extreme case of complete nucleon recombination",
    "there are still leftover neutrons because of the neutron excess ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "their minimum mass fraction is @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , synthesized helium is likely destroyed during the subsequent evolution of the explosion .",
    "this happens if ( 1 ) there appears a substantial relative bulk velocity between the neutron and ion components ( as a result of neutron decoupling during the acceleration stage of the fireball ) or ( 2 ) internal shocks occur and heat the ions to a high temperature ( beloborodov 2003a ) .",
    "thus , a substantial neutron component appears inevitably in the standard fireball scenario .",
    "neutrons develop a lorentz factor @xmath15 at the very beginning of the explosion when the fireball is accelerated by radiation pressure : they are collisionally coupled to the ions in the early dense fireball , and decouple close to the end of the acceleration stage . then the neutrons coast and gradually decay with a mean lifetime @xmath16",
    "s and a mean decay radius @xmath17 , [ eq : h ] = 0.810 ^ 16 ( )  cm .",
    "let us remind what happens in a relativistic explosion without neutrons .",
    "the ejected fireball with mass @xmath18 and lorentz factor @xmath19 sweeps up an ambient medium with density @xmath20  @xmath21 and gradually dissipates its kinetic energy .",
    "the dissipation rate peaks at a characteristic `` deceleration '' radius @xmath22  cm where half of the initial energy is dissipated .",
    "@xmath23 corresponds to swept - up mass @xmath24 .",
    "further dynamics is described by the self - similar blast wave model of blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) . how does this picture change in the presence of neutrons ?    at radii under consideration , @xmath25  cm , the ejected fireball is a shell of thickness @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast to neutrons , the ion component of the fireball is aware of the external medium and its lorentz factor @xmath27 decreases . as @xmath27 decreases below @xmath28 , the ions fall behind and separate from the neutrons .",
    "thus the fireball splits into two relativistic shells which we name n ( neutrons ) and i ( ions ) . the mass of the leading n - shell is decreasing because of the @xmath29-decay , [ eq : mn ] m_n(r)=m_n^0(- ) .",
    "the n - shell energy , @xmath30 , is huge compared to the ambient rest - mass @xmath31 even at @xmath32 .",
    "for example , at @xmath33 we find @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the initial neutron fraction of the fireball .",
    "the neutron decay products @xmath36 and @xmath37 share immediately their huge momentum with ambient particles due to two - stream instability and the n - shell leaves behind a mixed trail with a relativistic bulk velocity @xmath38 ( beloborodov 2003b ) [ eq : beta ] ( r)= , ( r)= = , where [ eq : zet ] ( r)= = ( ) ^-1 , and @xmath39 is ambient mass enclosed by radius @xmath40 .",
    "there exists a characteristic radius @xmath41 where the trail becomes nonrelativistic ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "it is defined by condition @xmath43 , which requires about 10 e - folds of the decay ( for a typical @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , 10=0.810 ^ 17 ( )  cm .",
    "@xmath41 depends very weakly ( logarithmically ) on the ambient density and the initial neutron fraction of the fireball , @xmath45 .",
    "the decaying n - shell not only accelerates the medium as it passes through it .",
    "it also compresses the medium , loads with new particles , and heat to a high temperature .",
    "the rest - frame density and relativistic enthalpy of the trail are [ eq : mu ] n = n_0(1+)(^2 + 2 + 1)^1/2 , = , where @xmath46 is the medium density ahead of the n - shell . for @xmath47",
    "one finds @xmath48 , i.e. the thermal energy of the trail far exceeds its rest - mass energy .",
    "the ion fireball follows the neutron front and collects the trail . as a result , ( 1 ) the ion lorentz factor @xmath27 decreases and ( 2 ) a shock wave propagates in the trail material .",
    "the shock has a lorentz factor @xmath49 and it can not catch up with the neutron front ( unless @xmath50 $ ] falls off steeper than @xmath51 ) .",
    "dynamics and dissipation in the shock are discussed in beloborodov ( 2003b ) .",
    "we emphasize here important differences from a customary external shock : the neutron - trail shock propagates in a relativistically moving , dense , hot , and possibly magnetized medium behind the leading neutron front .",
    "the neutron impact ceases at @xmath52  cm , which can leave an imprint on the observed afterglow .",
    "for example , the shock dissipation can have a second bump ( beloborodov 2003b ) , and a spectral transition is also possible .",
    "the arrival time of radiation emitted at @xmath41 is approximately @xmath53 ( counted from the arrival of first @xmath54-rays )",
    ". it may be as long as 30 days or as short as a few seconds , depending on the fireball lorentz factor @xmath55 .",
    "recent early observation of a grb afterglow ( grb  021004 ) discovered an interesting re - brightening at @xmath56  s. also , we do not exclude a possible relevance of neutrons to the 20  day bumps observed in a few grbs , as the time coincides with @xmath57 .",
    "neutron signatures should be absent if the fireball is dominated by a poynting flux and has extremely low baryon loading .",
    "then the neutron component decouples early , with a modest lorentz factor @xmath58 , and decays at small radii .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath58 due to decoupling is @xmath59 where @xmath60 [ g / s ] is the mass outflow rate per unit solid angle of the fireball ( beloborodov 2003a ) .",
    "an additional piece of grb physics is the interaction of the prompt @xmath54-ray radiation with an ambient medium ( see beloborodov 2002 and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "it leads to a gap opening and crucially affects the early afterglow emitted at radii @xmath61  cm , where @xmath62 [ erg ] is the isotropic energy of the grb . here",
    ", we focused on larger radii where the neutron effects dominate ."
