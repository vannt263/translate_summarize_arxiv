    "merging binaries consisting of black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars ( nss ) are prime targets for observation by ground - based gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors ( such as ligo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may be the progenitors of some short - hard gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs , * ? ? ?",
    "the great diversity of sgrb characteristics and the potential variation in the corresponding gw signals motivates a thorough investigation of the possible outcomes of binary compact object ( bco ) mergers .",
    "bcos may form through evolution of primordial binaries or through dynamical processes in star clusters  @xcite .",
    "the latter population motivates this study of bh - ns interactions for systems which are initially marginally unbound .",
    "star clusters at the centers of galaxies undergo mass segregation , resulting in heavier objects concentrated toward the center ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent fokker - plank models suggest that the galactic nuclear cluster ( nc ) should have @xmath0 bhs and @xmath1 nss in the central 0.1  pc @xcite .",
    "such clusters are thus promising sites for bh - ns close encounters . using models of galactic ncs ,",
    "@xcite calculate the rate of binary bh formation through gw emission in close encounters .",
    "they find corresponding advanced ligo detection rates between 5 and 2700 per year , and estimate that the bh - ns rate could be around 1% of this .",
    "these capture binaries form with relatively small periapsis separations , @xmath2 ; in particular , @xmath3% form with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total mass of the system ( fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "( unless otherwise stated we employ geometric units with @xmath6 . )",
    "this is due in part to the large velocity dispersion in the cluster core ( @xmath7  km  s@xmath8 ) , but also to gravitational focusing , which may be understood as follows .",
    "the total rate is proportional to the cross - section : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the impact parameter .",
    "however , for newtonian hyperbolic orbits with relative velocity @xmath11 at infinity , @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the rate is _ linearly _ proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) that have undergone core collapse may also host bco close encounters due to the high density of compact objects in their cores @xcite .",
    "for example , models of m15 calibrated to the observational velocity dispersion yield a ns fraction of @xmath13% in the inner 0.2  pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculate the expected rate of bco interactions inside m15 as a function of time and then scale these results for gcs with a distribution of half - mass relaxation times .",
    "depending upon the gc evolution model , they find that the global rate for bh - ns _ collisions _",
    "( i.e. , events for which @xmath14 ) peaks at @xmath15yr@xmath8gpc@xmath16 at redshifts between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and slowly declines to between @xmath19 of peak by @xmath20 .",
    "( we obtained the bh - ns collision rate by re - scaling their ns - ns results according to the factors in table 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "for the fiducial bh - ns system considered by @xcite , collisions occur at @xmath21 .",
    "since the rate scales linearly with @xmath2 , this implies an interaction rate @xmath22  yr@xmath8gpc@xmath16 with ( for example ) @xmath23 .",
    "population synthesis models @xcite find comparable rates for _ primordial _ bh - ns mergers : from @xmath24yr  @xmath8gpc@xmath16 ( pessimistic ) to @xmath25yr  @xmath8gpc@xmath16 ( optimistic ) .",
    "however , primordial bh - ns binaries will enter the ligo band with essentially zero eccentricity @xcite .",
    "thus , gw signals from bh - ns close encounters should be readily distinguishable due to their significant eccentricities .",
    "we further note that the sgrb rate , 8 - 30  yr@xmath8gpc@xmath16 @xcite , is comparable to the primordial bh - ns rate , and somewhat less than the expected ns - ns merger rate ( 30 - 400  yr@xmath8gpc@xmath16 @xcite ) .",
    "the estimates of @xcite thus suggest that close encounters in clusters could contribute significantly to the sgrb progenitor population , especially if their emission is less tightly beamed than that of primordial mergers @xcite .",
    "bh - ns mergers in clusters with @xmath4 will exhibit complicated behaviors probing the strong field regime of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "for stellar mass bh companions , one can not treat the ns as a perturbation of the bh spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the non - linear nature of gr will most strongly manifest during a close encounter of the bh - ns .",
    "numerical simulations within full gr are thus the preferred tool for exploring these systems . to date , such simulations have been performed by several groups @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these studies employ quasi - circular initial data , appropriate for primordial systems , and have explored a range of behaviors depending on the mass ratio , the bh spin , the ns equation of state ( eos ) , and the magnetic field .",
    "our results complement these works by offering a first study within full gr of initially hyperbolic encounters , of relevance to bh - ns capture events and related systems that merge with large eccentricity .    in the remainder of the letter we outline our numerical method , present results of our parameter space survey , and discuss some of their implications .",
    "the main result is the striking dependence of the outcome ",
    "disk mass , unbound material , and gw signal  on the impact parameter .",
    "though the most `` extreme '' outcomes might require fine - tuning and hence be rare , there is strong variation over the entire range @xmath26 we considered : for a hyperbolic encounter in a nc , this corresponds to roughly @xmath27 of encounters that lead to a bound system .",
    "we were not able to follow the larger @xmath2 cases through merger due to lack of computational resources , though certainly a fraction of these should also exhibit similar variability at the time of merger .",
    "this suggests that these systems could be a wellspring of varied and interesting gw and electromagnetic emission .",
    "our 3d numerical code solves the einstein field equations using finite difference ( fd ) techniques with berger and oliger style adaptive mesh refinement ( amr , * ? ? ?",
    "the numerical scheme for evolving the spacetime metric is substantively the same as the generalized harmonic method described by @xcite , except that the fd scheme is fourth order accurate and uses fourth order runge - kutta time integration .",
    "we model the ns material as a perfect fluid and solve the hydrodynamic energy - momentum and continuity equations using conservative high - resolution shock - capturing schemes with second order runge - kutta time integration , and enforce strict conservation at amr boundaries using the flux correction method of @xcite .",
    "we have implemented several methods for calculating inter - cell fluxes ( hll , @xcite ; the roe solver , @xcite ; and the marquina flux , @xcite ) and for reconstructing fluid primitive variables at cell interfaces ( mc and minmod , @xcite ; ppm , @xcite ; and weno-5 , @xcite ) . unless otherwise noted , the simulations described below were performed with hll and weno-5 .",
    "our hydrodynamics scheme allows for any eos of the form @xmath28 ( e.g. , @xmath29-law , piecewise polytrope , and tabular eoss ) .",
    "we have tested the new hydrodynamics sector of our code on problems including 1d and 2d riemann problems , bondi accretion , and single nss .",
    "more details on our code and tests will be presented in @xcite .",
    "for this first study the only parameter we vary is the initial periapsis separation .",
    "the bh and ns have a 4:1 mass ratio , and both are initially non - rotating .",
    "the ns is modeled as a tov star with a broken @xmath29-law eos ( labeled `` hb '' in @xcite and including a thermal component to allow for shock heating ) and has mass @xmath30 and radius 11.6  km .",
    "the initial orbital parameters describe a hyperbolic encounter with relative velocity @xmath31  km  s@xmath8 , corresponding to the central region of a nc @xcite .",
    "these orbits are nearly parabolic , with @xmath32 , and hence the close - encounter behavior also adequately describes such events in gcs .",
    "we superimpose initial data for the bh and ns at an initial separation of @xmath33 ( 498  km ) with initial velocities according to a newtonian orbit with the desired @xmath2 .",
    "though these superposed initial data do not strictly satisfy the constraint equations except at infinite separation , tests performed at various initial separations indicate that @xmath33 is sufficiently large that the constraint violation does not appreciably affect the system ( relative to truncation error ) .",
    "we consider a range of periapsis separations from @xmath34 to 15 ( _ i.e. , _ 50 to 150 km ) .",
    "( henceforth , we will consider @xmath2 to be normalized by @xmath5 . ) in all of these cases , sufficient energy is carried away by gws to result in a bound system .",
    "our simulations exhibit three types of behavior : ( 1 ) a direct plunge ( @xmath35 ) , ( 2 ) following the initial periapsis passage , a single elliptical orbit and then a plunge ( @xmath36 ) , and ( 3 ) following the initial periapsis passage , a long - period elliptical orbit ( @xmath37 ) . for the latter group ( and the high resolution @xmath38 run ) , the entire orbit is prohibitively long to simulate , and we focus on the burst of gws associated with the first periapsis passage . for one case in each class ( @xmath39 ) we ran three simulations with different characteristic mesh spacings ( but always with 7 refinement levels ) for convergence studies . at @xmath40 , the low ( medium , high ) resolution run had finest meshes covering the bh and ns of roughly @xmath41 ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) cells , resolving the ns diameter with @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) cells and the bh horizon diameter with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) cells .",
    "( we note that the level structure is set by truncation error estimates and is adjusted with time . )",
    "all other simulations were run at medium resolution . unless otherwise noted ,",
    "results will be reported for medium resolution , with error bars ( where appropriate ) computed from convergence calculations .",
    "our simulations employ compactified coordinates such that the outer boundaries extend to spatial infinity .",
    "thus , the global ( adm ) @xmath5 and @xmath50 should be conserved . in practice , however , we must evaluate these quantities at a finite distance , making them subject to gauge artifacts , some propagating outward from the central bh / ns region from @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath51 , an extraction sphere of @xmath52 is free of propagating artifacts , whence @xmath5 ( @xmath50 ) is conserved to better than @xmath53 ( 2.0)% for all cases at medium resolution .    based on the above of runs , some guidance from perturbative results @xcite , and a zoom - whirl geodesic analogue of the two body problem @xcite , we conjecture the following qualitative behavior as a function of @xmath2 for initial encounters resulting in a bound system .",
    "consider @xmath54 , the non - negative , integer number of periapsis passages before disruption / plunge , and @xmath55 , the periapsis distance on the @xmath56 encounter for @xmath57 .",
    "_ define _ @xmath58 to be an _ effective _ periapsis distance for the final close encounter ( i.e. , the corresponding @xmath2 before the disruption / plunge part of the final encounter ) .",
    "group ( 1 ) above has @xmath59 , group ( 2 ) @xmath60 , and group ( 3 ) @xmath61 .",
    "the behavior of a close encounter will depend sensitively on the distance @xmath62 between @xmath55 and a radius @xmath63 of an effective _ unstable circular _ orbit with the _ same _ energy and angular momentum .",
    "if @xmath64 is sufficiently small ( relative to @xmath5 ) , the orbit will exhibit a whirl phase , where it asymptotes to a nearly circular orbit .",
    "the smaller @xmath64 , the longer the duration of the whirl , with a maximum when @xmath65 that equals the time required for the binary to lose its _ excess _ orbital kinetic energy , either via gw emission or tidal transfer of energy to the ns material .",
    "the excess energy is the difference between the total energy of the binary entering the whirl phase and a putative binary on a _ quasi - circular _ inspiral at @xmath63 .",
    "because of the requirement that @xmath64 be small , we only expect the possibility of significant whirling near the ultimate or penultimate encounter . if @xmath64 is negative , the whirl will directly transition to a plunge .",
    "if positive and small , there will be a separation following the whirl ; however the effective @xmath63 for the next encounter _ increases _ while @xmath55 _ decreases _ due to gw emission , and since this is quite sizeable for our 4:1 mass ratio system , @xmath66 will likely be negative , resulting in a subsequent plunge .",
    "furthermore , the separation where the ns starts to be tidally disrupted is within the radii of unstable whirl orbits , hence the ns will not survive any prolonged whirl phase .",
    "prior encounters ( for larger @xmath54 cases ) will not exhibit significant whirling , and while @xmath64 is large the orbital evolution could better be described as a series of precessing ellipses with decreasing eccentricity and semi - major axis .    considering the number of orbits @xmath54 as a function of",
    "the _ initial _",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath67 is monotonically increasing , and the values of @xmath2 where one could see a notable final whirl would be near the steps in @xmath67 .",
    "the most pronounced whirl behavior will occur for small @xmath67 ; as @xmath67 increases , the amount of excess kinetic energy left over once the final orbit is reached decreases , and for sufficiently large @xmath54 the late stages will essentially follow a quasi - circular inspiral .",
