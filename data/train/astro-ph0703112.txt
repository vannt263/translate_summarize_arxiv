    "recent studies have highlighted the numerous ways in which young brown dwarfs ( bds ) bear a striking resemblance to classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) @xcite .",
    "this comparison not only provides information relevant to theories of bd formation , but also allows the validity of the accretion / ejection models for the formation of solar - mass stars , to be tested in the sub - stellar domain .",
    "emphasis has been on probing accretion @xcite .",
    "while such studies point to t tauri - like infall in bds , relatively little is known about their outflow activity .",
    "outflows in cttss are directly related to magnetospheric infall @xcite , hence it is feasible that bds demonstrating strong accretion will drive jets .",
    "the h@xmath5  10@xmath6 line width criterion ( full width of the line at 10@xmath6 of the peak emission ) used to distinguish accreting t tauri stars from those where the line emission is primarily due to chromospheric activity , has been successfully applied to bds @xcite .",
    "a bd with a h@xmath5  10@xmath6 width @xmath7 200 kms@xmath2 is accepted as a strong accretor .",
    "high resolution spectroscopic observations subsequently found that many of the accreting bds also have forbidden emission lines ( fels ) @xcite .",
    "the fels of cttss are important outflow tracers and their discovery provided the first hint that accreting bds could also power outflows .",
    "direct imaging has proven very difficult as expected on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach adopted by @xcite is to search for sub - stellar outflows through the spectro - astrometric analysis of fels . using this method the first bd ouflow , driven by @xmath8-oph 102 ,",
    "was discovered . here",
    "the detection of a faint bipolar jet from a second strongly accreting bd , 2mass1207 - 3932 ( hereafter 2mass1207 ) using the eso vlt , is reported .",
    "these observations are part of an important on - going study to search for outflows from bds .    that such outflows are present is physically reasonable since it seems unlikely that the outflow mechanism has anything to do with the eventual triggering of fusion in the core .",
    "moreover jets from the very low mass stars par - lup3 - 4 @xcite and eso - h@xmath5 574 @xcite have been found recently .",
    "in addition a molecular outflow from the l1014 dense low luminosity core and possible bd precursor has been found by @xcite .",
    "2mass1207 was identified by @xcite and @xcite as a sub - stellar member of the tw hydrae association . given the age of the association ( @xmath3 8 myr ) , the evolutionary tracks of @xcite were then used to estimate a mass of @xmath3 35 m@xmath9 for this bd . more recently the mass has been revised downwards to 24m@xmath9 @xmath10 6m@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the nature of this bd as a strong accretor was clearly evident from early observations .",
    "@xcite reported bright asymmetric h@xmath5  emission , with a full width at 10@xmath6 of the peak flux , of @xmath7 200 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the new optical spectra presented here , lead to a value of @xmath3 320 kms@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite were the first to observe the [ oi]@xmath16300  line in the spectrum of 2mass1207 suggesting it could be driving an outflow .",
    "2mass1207 is known for its line variability .",
    "@xcite studied its h@xmath5  emission over a period of 6 weeks and reported a change by a factor of 5 - 10 in the accretion rate during that time .",
    "they also used the shape and variability of the h@xmath5  line to infer a near edge - on orientation for the accretion disk .",
    "the prominent red - shifted absorption feature in the h@xmath5  line ( see figure 1b ) is strongly dependent on the inclination @xmath11 , between the rotational axis and the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the absorption feature should only be observed when the disk is seen close to edge - on i.e. @xmath11 @xmath12 60@xmath13 .",
    "refer to @xcite and @xcite for further details .",
    "such a geometry suggests that an outflow , will be in the plane of the sky .",
    "lastly 2mass1207 is a binary with a planetary mass companion @xcite . to summarise 2mass1207",
    "is an ideal candidate to include in our search for outflows driven by young bds .",
    "it is a strong accretor with known [ oi]@xmath16300  emission .",
    "high resolution ( r=40,000 ) cross - dispersed spectra of 2mass1207 ( cd3 disperser , spectral range 4810 - 6740  ) were obtained with uv - visual echelle spectrometer ( uves ) @xcite on the eso vlt ut2 , on may 16 2006 .",
    "the results presented in this letter represent the sum of two 45 min exposures with a 1  slit .",
    "the seeing was 06 and the spatial sampling was 0182 per pixel .",
    "the data was reduced using standard iraf routines , and the 2d spectra obtained were smoothed using an elliptical gaussian filter of fwhm 0.12 @xmath14 022 .",
    "the gaussian smoothing improved the signal to noise and effectively decreased the spectral and spatial resolution to r @xmath3 8000 and 07 respectively .",
    "the night sky lines were then removed .",
    "all velocities are quoted with respect to the systemic velocity of 2mass1207 which is measured from the lii@xmath16708 line to be + 2kms@xmath2 , in the lsr frame .",
    "the final stage in the analysis was to apply the technique of spectro - astrometry to the smoothed spectra .",
    "for the majority of protostars with jets , the fel regions of their spectra are very obviously spatially extended , particularly at high velocities , e.g. the fels of the ctts dg tau trace a @xmath3 12  knotty jet @xcite .",
    "when however the emission is very compact and close to the source , specialised methods have to be used to probe its nature .",
    "in particular spectro - astrometry can investigate through gaussian fitting , the offset of emission line features smaller than the seeing disc of the observation .",
    "the result of this technique is an offset - velocity diagram with the displacement of a spectral feature , e.g. the [ oi]@xmath16300 , line shown as a function of velocity and relative to the continuum centroid of the object @xcite . figure 1 shows the results of the spectro - astrometry and see @xcite for a thorough discussion of the method .",
    "@xmath16300 , h@xmath5  and he i lines .",
    "the line profiles are an average of three pixel rows in the spatial direction centred on the continuum .",
    "note the continuum has not been subtracted .",
    "the green dashed lines delineate the @xmath10 1 @xmath15 error envelope for the centroid position of the continuum . as explained in the text the line and continuum centroid errors are the same in all cases . in particular for h@xmath5   the spectrum is smoothed so that error in the centroid position of the wing emission is comparable to that for the continuum .",
    "the error decreases for the line peak region as is clear in ( b ) .",
    "the red - shifted absorption feature in the h@xmath5  line is a signature of infall .",
    "the bipolar offset in the [ oi]@xmath16300  reveals the presence of an outflow .",
    "no offsets are measured in the h@xmath5  and he i lines as expected ruling out the possibility of spectro - astrometric artifacts .",
    "lastly the gaps in the position of the continuum blueward of the [ oi]@xmath16300  and h@xmath5  lines , mark the position of night sky lines .",
    "the night sky lines have been reomved from the line profiles and as found by @xcite the presence or not of these sky lines has no effect on the spectro - astrometric results.,width=340,height=491 ]",
    "the [ oi]@xmath166300,6363  lines are the only  traditional \" fel tracers seen in the uves spectrum . a position velocity ( pv ) diagram of the smoothed [ oi]@xmath16300  spectrum is presented in figure 2 .",
    "blue and red - shifted emission is observed at velocities of @xmath3 -8 kms@xmath2  and @xmath3 + 4kms@xmath2  and a relative displacement between the two parts of the line is apparent .",
    "also the relatively very small radial velocity of the outflow is consistent with the near edge - on disk hypothesis for 2mass1207 .",
    "we observe the [ oi]@xmath16300 line at the same velocity as reported by @xcite . however due to the use of a larger telescope ( 8 m as opposed to 6.5 m ) and a longer exposure time we retrieved more detailed kinematic information .",
    "note also that @xcite failed to detect forbidden emission in the spectrum of this bd .",
    "again this is due to the use of a smaller telescope and the larger spectral resolution of their observations ( r @xmath3 60,000 ) .",
    "the [ oi ] night sky line has been removed here and there is emission ( at @xmath3 -35kms@xmath2 ) on the farside of the night sky line position .",
    "this is probably also associated with the blue - shifted outflow .",
    "the results of a spectro - astrometric analysis of the smoothed spectrum is shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "the first step in this analysis is to map the position of the bd through gaussian fitting of the spatial profile of the continuum .",
    "as the optical continuum emission from a bd , is by definition much weaker than for a ctts say , it is necessary to bin or smooth the bd continuum in order to increase the spectro - astrometric accuracy .",
    "the error in the spectro - astrometric analysis depends strongly on the s / n and is given by @xmath17 = @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of detected photons .",
    "once the continuum is mapped it is subtracted and the spatial profile of the pure line emission analysed .",
    "an approach first adopted by @xcite was to bin the continuum and line emission in such a way that as to ensure that a comparable number of photons are sampled at each point .",
    "in other words the spectro - astrometric accuracy achieved in the line and continuum is comparable .    here in the same way",
    "the continuum and [ oi]@xmath16300  line emission are smoothed so that the spectro - astrometric error in both regions are the same .",
    "the blue and red - shifted components to the [ oi]@xmath16300  line are found to be offset in opposing directions to an absolute distance of @xmath3 80 mas ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "hence it is clear that the [ oi]@xmath16300  emission originates in a faint bipolar outflow driven by 2mass1207 .",
    "the 1-@xmath15 error in the measurements , of 18 mas is marked , by the dashed line in figure 1a .",
    "also as in @xcite the presence or not of the [ oi]@xmath16300   night sky line was found to have no effect on the spectro - astrometric results .    @xmath16300  line in 2mass1207 . here",
    "the spectrum was smoothed in both the spectral and spatial directions using an elliptical gaussian function of fwhm 0.12 @xmath14 022 .",
    "the contours begin at 3 times the r.m.s noise and increase in intervals of the r.m.s noise .",
    "the zero spatial offset line is measured from an accurate mapping of the continuum position using spectro - astrometry .",
    "the red and blue - shifted components to the line are obvious and an opposing offset in these components is suggested .",
    "this offset is recovered using spectro - astrometry ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the [ oi]@xmath16300  night sky line has been removed from the spectrum and the feature blueward of this sky line , at @xmath3 -35 kms@xmath2  is probably also part of the blue - shifted outflow.,width=283,height=377 ]    other lines of interest are [ oi]@xmath16363 , h@xmath5 and hei@xmath16678 . the [ oi]@xmath16363 is @xmath3 3 times fainter than the [ oi]@xmath16300   line and hence is just below the detection limit in the raw spectrum . by smoothing the spectrum using a large gaussian filter ( fwhm in dispersion direction = 0.35  )",
    "the [ oi]@xmath16363 is revealed at a similar velocity to the [ oi]@xmath16300  line , although detailed kinematic data is lost .",
    "the primary origin of the h@xmath5  and hei@xmath16678 lines is in the accretion flow .",
    "as this occurs on a very small scale we expect to measure no spectro - astrometric offset and as can be seen in figure 1 , none is found ruling out the presence of spectro - astrometric artifacts @xcite . the h@xmath5  line is often seen in ctts to have an outflow component .",
    "however at these scales any outflow component would certainly be extrememly weak relative to the bulk of the h@xmath5  emission and therefore again very difficult to detect . as the h@xmath5",
    "line is much brighter than any other part of the spectrum , and as any outflow signature would be found in the wings , the line and the continuum are smoothed in such a way that the error in the continuum and the line - wings are comparable .",
    "all that is seen is a tightening of the h@xmath5   position ( due to the higher s / n ) as one moves towards the peak of the line ( figure 1b ) .",
    ".table comparing the mass ( in jupiter masses ) , mass accretion rates and typical fel velocities of 2mass1207 , @xmath8-oph 102 and ls rcra 1",
    ". the accretion rate for @xmath8-oph 102 was derived using the h@xmath5  emission line and is taken from @xcite . for 2mass1207 and",
    "ls rcra 1 @xcite used the caii@xmath18662 line fluxes to infer the mass accretion rates . the mass estimate for ls - rcr a1",
    "is taken from @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "while it is accepted that accretion activity in bds is simply a scaled down version of infall in cttss @xcite , the presumption that bds also drive scaled - down versions of t tauri jets and outflows while credible , has yet to be generally confirmed . here",
    "the evidence gathered so far supporting the continuation of the ctt paradigm for outflow activity , into the young bd mass regime , is summarised .",
    "table 1 presents a comparison between the three bds whose high resolution optical spectra have been analysed by us to date .",
    "ls - rcra 1 probably has the strongest fels of any bd @xcite and it is very likely that these fels are excited in an jet . yet direct imaging and a preliminary spectro - astrometric study failed to confirm such an origin for these features @xcite .",
    "in particular spectro - astrometry is difficult due to the faintness of this objhect which in turn is almost certainly caused by an edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "the relatively low radial velocities of the fels of ls - rcra 1 support this picture . from table 1 @xmath8-oph 102 , 2mass1207 and",
    "ls - rcra 1 appear to launch outflows of comparable velocities . also for 2mass1207 and @xmath8-oph 102 the [ oi]@xmath16300  line emitting region is offset by similar distances from the bd .",
    "hence these three sub - stellar objects present a consistent picture of outflow activity in bds , but how do their fel regions ( felrs ) compare to those of cttss ?    the most notable features of the felrs of cttss are their blue - shifted and often multi - component nature @xcite .",
    "the lack of red - shifted fe is accounted for by the obscuring effect of the accretion disk .",
    "only blue - shifted emission is observed for @xmath8-oph 102 and the scale of the blue - shifted offset ( 0@xmath20085 ) reported by @xcite for @xmath8-oph 102 would suggest a minimum ( projected ) disk radius of 01 ( @xmath12 15 au at the distance to the @xmath8-ophiuchi cloud ) in order to hide any red - shifted component .",
    "for 2mass1207 the fact that both blue and red - shifted fe is detected is consistent with the near edge - on disk hypothesis .",
    "lastly @xcite discuss the distance from a typical bd at which the critical density ( n@xmath21 ) for forbidden emission is expected to be reached , if it is assumed that bd jets are similar in temperature , line excitation and opening angle to t tauri jets .",
    "this distance is derived by considering how n@xmath21 ( 2 x 10@xmath22 @xmath23 for [ oi]@xmath16300 ) is expected to scale with mass flux through the jet .",
    "using the predictions of @xcite , the distance for forbidden emission ( and thus measured offsets ) is estimated to be 3 - 10 times closer to a bd than a ctts .",
    "the [ oi]@xmath16300  offsets measured for 2mass1207 lie within this mass range .",
    "these offsets are maximised due to the probable edge - on disk geometry of 2mass1207 . in conclusion",
    "there is much evidence in existence to support the continuation t tauri like outflow activity into the mass range of young bds .",
    "our analysis of the high spatial resolution spectrum of 2mass1207 clearly uncovers the existence of a bipolar , t - tauri like outflow .",
    "this result is in agreement with the classification of 2mass1207 as a strong accretor with forbidden emission and its proposed near edge - on disk geometry .",
    "as 2mass1207 is only a @xmath3 24m@xmath9 object it now ranks as the least massive galactic object known to drive a jet .",
    "given the age of the tw hydrae association it is also one of the oldest galactic objects with a resolved jet .",
    "the age of 2mass1207 highlights that outflows can persist for a relativley long time , even when an object is sub - stellar , and the derived mass accretion rates are relatively low .",
    "overall this discovery is not only intriguing but important as it emphasises the robustness of the outflow mechanism over an enormous range of masses ( up to 10@xmath24m@xmath25 in active galactic nuclei ) and it adds weight to the idea that at least , massive planets may also be outflow sources when they form .",
    "see @xcite for an intriguing discussion of the possibility of outflows driven by proto - jovian planets ."
