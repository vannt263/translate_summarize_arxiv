    "there is strong observational evidence @xcite that approximately @xmath4 of the total energy density of the universe is in the form of dark matter .",
    "up until now it is unclear what this dark matter should be made of .",
    "one of the favourite candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) which arise in extensions of the standard model .",
    "recently , new theoretical models of the dark matter sector have been proposed @xcite , in which the standard model is coupled to the dark sector via an attractive interaction term .",
    "these models have been motivated by new astrophysical observations @xcite which show an excess in electronic production in the galaxy .",
    "depending on the experiment , the energy of these excess electrons is between a few gev and a few tev .",
    "one possible explanation for these observations is the annihilation of dark matter into electrons . below the gev scale ,",
    "the interaction term in these models is basically of the form of a direct coupling between the u(1 ) field strength tensor of the dark matter sector and the u(1 ) field strength tensor of electromagnetism .",
    "the u(1 ) symmetry of the dark sector has to be spontaneously broken , otherwise a `` dark photon '' background leading to observable consequences would exist .    consequently , it has been shown that the dark sector can have string - like solutions , denominated `` dark strings '' and the observational consequences of the interaction of these dark strings with the standard model have been discussed @xcite .",
    "topological defects are believed to have formed in the numerous phase transitions in the early universe due to the kibble mechanism @xcite . while magnetic monopoles and domain walls , which result from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a spherical and parity symmetry , respectively , are catastrophic for the universe since they would overclose it , cosmic strings are an acceptable remnant from the early universe .",
    "these objects form whenever an axial symmetry gets spontaneously broken and ( due to topological arguments ) are either infinitely long or exist in the form of cosmic string loops .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of cosmic string networks have shown that these reach a scaling solution , i.e. their contribution to the total energy density of the universe becomes constant at some stage . the main mechanism that allows cosmic string networks to reach",
    "this scaling solution is the formation of cosmic string loops due to self - intersection and the consequent decay of these loops under the emission of gravitational radiation .    for some time",
    ", cosmic strings were believed to be responsible for the structure formation in the universe .",
    "new cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data , however , clearly shows that the theoretical power spectrum associated to cosmic strings is in stark contrast to the observed power spectrum .",
    "however , there has been a recent revival of cosmic strings since it is now believed that cosmic strings might be linked to the fundamental strings of string theory @xcite .    while perturbative fundamental strings were excluded to be observable on cosmic scales for many reasons @xcite , there are now new theories containing extra dimensions , so - called brane world model , that allow to lower the fundamental planck scale down to the tev scale .",
    "this and the observation that cosmic strings generically form at the end of inflation in inflationary models resulting from string theory @xcite and supersymmetric grand unified theories @xcite has boosted the interest in comic string solutions again .",
    "different field theoretical models describing cosmic strings have been investigated .",
    "the @xmath5 abelian  higgs model possesses string  like solutions @xcite .",
    "this is a simple toy model that is frequently used to describe cosmic strings .",
    "however , the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath6 has very likely never occurred in the evolution of the universe .",
    "consequently , more realistic models with gauge group @xmath7 and symmetry breaking @xmath8 have been considered and it has been shown that these models have string  like solutions @xcite .",
    "semilocal strings are solutions of a @xmath9 model which  in fact",
    " corresponds to the standard model of particle physics in the limit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the simplest semilocal string solution is an embedded abelian ",
    "higgs solution @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the stability of these embedded solutions has shown @xcite that they are unstable ( stable ) if the higgs boson mass is larger ( smaller ) than the gauge boson mass . in the case of equality of the two masses ,",
    "the solutions fulfill a bogomolny  prasad ",
    "sommerfield ( bps ) @xcite bound such that their energy per unit length is directly proportional to the winding number .",
    "interestingly , it has been observed @xcite that in this bps limit , a one - parameter family of solutions exists : the goldstone field can form a non - vanishing condensate inside the string core and the energy per unit length is independent of the value of this condensate .",
    "these solutions are also sometimes denominated `` skyrmions '' and have been related to the zero - mode present in the bps limit .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the interaction of dark strings with string  like solutions of the standard model in the specific limit @xmath10 .",
    "the two sectors interact via an attractive interaction that couples the two @xmath5 field strength tensors to each other . this type of interaction has been studied before in @xcite , where the interaction between abelian  higgs strings and dark strings has been investigated .",
    "it has been found that a bps bound exists that depends on the interaction paramater and that abelian ",
    "higgs strings and dark strings can form bound states .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give the model , the equations of motion , the boundary conditions and the asymptotics . in section 3",
    ", we present our numerical results and section 4 contains our conclusions .",

    "higgs solutions '' , while solutions with @xmath34 will be referred to as `` semilocal solutions '' .",
    "note that in the case @xmath35 , the solutions of the semilocal sector of our model are often also denominated `` skyrmions '' .      we define the following dimensionless variable @xmath36 , which measures the radial distance in units of @xmath37 .",

    "this then reads : @xmath53 note that the string tension @xmath54 is equal to the energy per unit length .",
    "there are a few special case , in which energy bounds can be given :    1 .   for @xmath55",

    "our results are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",

    "this is also true when increasing @xmath60 . increasing @xmath60 decreases the core size of the dark string , this increases gradient energy and we again have to compensate by increasing the value of @xmath59 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the interaction of semilocal strings with dark strings has important effects on the properties of the former . while embedded abelian ",
    "higgs strings exist for all values of the higgs to gauge boson ratio when interacting with dark strings , semilocal strings with a condensate inside their core exist only above a critical value of the higgs to gauge boson ratio . at this critical value , the embedded abelian  higgs ",
    "dark strings become unstable .",
    "the critical value of the ratio depends on the choice of the higgs to gauge boson ratio of the dark string and the windings . in the limit where the ratio tends to the critical ratio , the condensate vanishes identically and the branch of semilocal ",
    "dark string solutions bifurcates with the branch of embedded abelian ",
    "dark string solutions .",

    "dark strings exist depends on the value of the condensate on the string axis and increases for increasing values of the condensate .",
    "all these results are quite different from what is observed in the non  interacting case . in the non",
    " interacting case , semilocal strings exist only for higgs to gauge boson ratio equal to unity and in this limit , the energy per unit length is independent of the value of the condensate and in addition fulfills a bps bound . to state it differently  : when not interacting with dark strings , semilocal strings and embedded abelian ",
    "higgs strings are degenerate in energy , while the former are lower in energy as soon as they interact with dark strings . since the branch of semilocal ",
    "dark string solutions bifurcates with the branch of embedded abelian  higgs ",
    "dark strings at the self  dual point of the embedded abelian ",
    "higgs - dark strings  at which these fulfill an energy bound @xcite  we expect that semilocal ",
    "dark strings are stable .",
    "moreover , they are stable for all choices of the higgs to gauge boson ratio for which they exist and not just  as in the non  interacting case  for higgs to gauge boson ratio smaller or equal to unity .",
    "since all current observations point to the fact that the higgs boson mass is larger than the gauge boson masses , semilocal strings could still be stable when interacting with dark strings . interestingly  as mentioned above  semilocal strings can lower their energy by forming a non  vanishing condensate inside their core .",
    "this could be important for the evolution of cosmic string networks since next to the formation of bound states @xcite this would be a further mechanism for the network to loose energy .",
    "we did nt study the gravitational properties of the solutions since we believe that the qualitative features are similar to the case studied in @xcite . since semilocal  dark strings have lower energy per unit length than their embedded ablian  higgs ",
    "dark string counterparts , we would expect the deficit angle created by the former to be smaller than that of the latter .",
    "furthermore , the critical value of the gravitational coupling at which the solutions become singular is larger for the semilocal ",
    "dark strings than for the embedded abelian  higgs",
