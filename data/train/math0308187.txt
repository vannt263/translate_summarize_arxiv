    "the real structure on charts given by polygons comes from a global isometric involution reversing the orientation on @xmath323 , denoted by @xmath338 .",
    "the involution @xmath338 can be described as the reflection of polytopes in a plane .",
    "as the vertices are labeled , the fixed - points set of @xmath338 is exactly @xmath184 .",

    "the two cases marked as orbifolds in table  [ tableau ] have only one singular stratum , which is represented by the triple @xmath341 ( see ( [ eq : orbifold triple ] ) ) .    from the discussion below proposition  [ lem : calcul angle ] , we know that the other examples are neither manifolds nor orbifolds .",
    "we check this fact .",
    "if there exists three angles @xmath195 such that the dihedral angles given by @xmath339 and @xmath342 are @xmath343 , then the total angle around the singular set defined by these angles is at least four times @xmath344 , plus something less than @xmath16 ( we know that these dihedral angles of orthoschemes are @xmath345 ) , hence it ca nt be @xmath346 .",
    "it is easy to see that such a condition occurs for the triples @xmath347 , @xmath348 , @xmath349 , @xmath350 , @xmath351 and @xmath352 , which cover all the cases indicated in table  [ tableau ] .",

    "there are more orbifolds : if @xmath353 and @xmath190 , then the angle around the stratum is half of the one obtained with labeling .",
    "such orbifolds were founded in @xcite . the complete list is achieved in @xcite ( the list is known to be complete due to @xcite and @xcite ) .",
