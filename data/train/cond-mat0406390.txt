    "a growing interest has focused on the statistical physics of complex networks .",
    "they describe a wide range of systems in nature and society , modeling diverse systems as the world wide web , the net of human sexual contacts , or a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "such networks posse a rich set of scaling properties .",
    "a number of them are scale - free , that is , the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly @xmath0 links decay as a power law , following @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the degree exponent , in consequence they present resilience against random breakdowns , this effect is known as robustness of the network .",
    "the shortest - path - length between their sites grows slowly ( i.e. logarithmically ) with the size of the network .",
    "that is , in spite of large sizes of networks , the distance between their sites are short - a feature known as the `` small world '' effect .",
    "the majority of networks used to generate a scale - free topology are stochastic , they create networks in which the nodes appear to be randomly connected to each other .",
    "scale - free random networks have naturally a continuous degree distribution spectrum , but recently it has been shown that discrete degree distributions of some deterministic graphs also have a power law decay @xcite . furthermore , scale - free random networks are excellently modeled by such deterministic graphs @xcite .",
    "however the comparison between the behavior of stochastic and deterministic networks in the simulation of a particular model still remains open .",
    "the involvement of physics in research on spreading of opinion s models has been a matter of increasing studies nowadays ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "of particular interest here is the sznajd model @xcite , which is one of several recent consensus - finding models @xcite and in which each randomly selected pair of nearest neighbors convinces all its neighbors of the pair opinion , only if the pair shares the same opinion ; otherwise , the neighbor opinions are not affected .",
    "one time step means that on average every lattice node is selected once as the first member of the pair .",
    "it differs from other consensus models by dealing only with communication between neighbors , and the information flows outward , as in rumors spreading .",
    "in contrast , in most other models the information flows inward .",
    "initially , two opinions ( @xmath3 ) are randomly distributed with probability @xmath4 over all the nodes of the lattice .",
    "the basic sznajd model with random sequential updating always leads to a consensus ( all sites have opinion @xmath5 or @xmath6 and the whole system reaches a fixed point after a certain time of simulation ) . a phase transition is often observed as a function of the initial concentration of opinion @xmath4 . a generalization to many different opinions ( instead of only @xmath3 ) put into a barabsi - albert network @xcite reproduced quite well the results of the complex elections of city councillors in the state of minas gerais in brazil @xcite .",
    "although the barabsi - albert @xcite network has successfully explained the scale - free nature of many networks , a striking discrepancy between it and real networks is that the value of the clustering coefficient - which is the probability that two nearest neighbors of the same node are also mutual neighbors - predicted by the theoretical model decays very fast with the network size and for large systems is typically several orders of magnitude lower than found empirically ( it vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ) . in social networks , for instance",
    ", the clustering coefficient distribution @xmath7 exhibits a power - law behavior , @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is number of neighbors ( degree or connectivity ) of the node and @xmath9 ( everyone in the network knows each other ) .",
    "very recently , by adding a triad formation step on the barabsi - albert prescription , this problem has been surmounted and scale - free models with high clustering coefficient have been investigated @xcite . the barabsi - albert network starts with a small number @xmath10 ( @xmath11 in our simulations ) of sites ( agents , people ) all connected with each other .",
    "( for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 we observed similar results for 100 runs each . )",
    "then a large number @xmath15 of additional sites is added as follows : first , each new node ( node @xmath16 ) performs a preferential attachment step , i.e , it is attached randomly to one of the existing nodes ( node @xmath17 ) with a probability proportional to its degree ; then follows a triad formation step with a probability @xmath18 : the new node @xmath16 selects at random a node in the neighborhood of the one linked to in the previous preferential attachment step ( node @xmath17 ) .",
    "if all neighbors of @xmath17 are already connected to @xmath16 , then a preferential attachment step is performed ( `` friends of friends get friends '' ) . in this model",
    ", the original barabsi - albert network corresponds to the case of @xmath19 .",
    "it is expected that a nonzero @xmath18 gives a finite nonzero clustering coefficient as @xmath15 is increased , while the clustering coefficient goes to zero when @xmath19 ( the ba scale - free network model ) .",
    "every node in the network is considered to be an individual with an opinion that in the beginning of the simulation is randomly chosen with probability @xmath4 for opinion @xmath5 .",
    "once the network has been completely constructed , we start the consensus process of sznajd . at every time step @xmath20 , all the nodes are randomly visited and updated ( a random list of nodes assures that each node is reached exactly once ) by following four variations :    * * 1 site convincing : * for each site @xmath16 chosen , we change the opinion of all its neighbors to the site s opinion . *",
    "* 2 sites convincing : * for each site @xmath16 chosen , we select randomly one of its neighbors .",
    "if this selected neighbor has the same opinion as the site @xmath16 , then all their neighbors follow the pair s opinion .",
    "otherwise , nothing is done . * * 3 sites convincing : * for each @xmath16 site chosen , we select 2 of its neighbors at random . if all these three sites have the same opinion , they change the opinion of all their neighbors . *",
    "* triad convincing : * for each @xmath16 site chosen , we select 2 of its neighbors at random .",
    "if all these three sites form a triangle and have the same opinion , they change the opinion of all their neighbors . in the previous case ,",
    "the 3 nodes must be connected with each other , they must not necessarily form a triangle .    in figure ( [ fig : rule_general ] )",
    "we present the mean opinion of the network as a function of the initial concentration @xmath4 of opinion @xmath5 for all the cases mentioned above after @xmath21 and @xmath22 timesteps . from this figure",
    "we can see that after @xmath21 timestep in all the cases a full consensus can not be reached , however after @xmath22 timesteps the whole system always lead to a fixed point : consensus ( all sites have opinion @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) . figures [ fig : rule1 ] , [ fig : rule2 ] and [ fig : rule3 ] correspond to the average of the results obtained for @xmath23 samples ( @xmath23 different initial seeds for the random number generator ) . for 2 nodes , 3 nodes and triad ( not shown ) convincing rules one can observe a phase transition : concentration @xmath24 lead to full consensus @xmath5 and concentrations @xmath25 to full consensus @xmath6 for large enough systems .",
    "since in a finite network , of course , phase transitions are never sharp , and thus the transition is indicated numerically by a slope ( figs .",
    "[ fig : rule2 ] and [ fig : rule3 ] ) becoming the steeper the larger the network size is . in an infinite network",
    ", one would get a sharp step function for the mean opinion of the sytems versus the initial concentration @xmath4 of opinion @xmath5 .",
    "this does not hold for the @xmath26 node convincing case ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rule1 ] ) where there is no such transition and the mean opinion of the system varies smoothly as a function of the initial density of opinion @xmath5 , as well the results does not have any dependence on the network size @xmath15 .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath27 here observed does not exist in one dimension @xcite or when a single site @xcite ( instead of a pair or plaquette ) on the square lattice @xcite convinces its neighbors , although it is also found on the square lattice when a plaquette or a neighboring pair persuades its neighbors @xcite , on a correlated - diluted square lattice @xcite , on a triangular and simple cubic lattice if a pair convinces its @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 , respectively ) neighbors @xcite , on the barabsi - albert network @xcite and on a pseudo - fractal network @xcite .      instead of beginning the simulation with only two opinions , @xmath30 or @xmath31",
    ", now we analyze the model when many different opinions are considered . after generating the triad network , as explained before , every individual assumes an opinion randomly selected from @xmath32 different opinions , with @xmath32 ranging from 2 opinions ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) to the network size @xmath15 ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 or @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 $ ] . at every time step @xmath20 , all the nodes are randomly selected and updated by following the rules previously described .    in figures [ fig : pluri_rule2 ] and [ fig : pluri_rule3 ] we present the fraction of samples , out of 1000 , ending with full consensus as a function of the scaled number @xmath39 of different opinions at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the insets show the scaled number @xmath40 of different opinions at the end of the simulation versus the scaled number @xmath41 of different ones at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the @xmath26 node convincing rule ( not shown ) always leads the system to a full consensus ( the whole system reaches a fixed point after some time - steps , i.e. , all sites have the same opinion ) independently of the initial number of different opinions and the network size @xmath15 . nevertheless ,",
    "if the system evolves under the @xmath42 nodes convincing rule ( figure [ fig : pluri_rule2 ] ) , all the samples reach a fixed point with all the individuals having the same opinion ( @xmath43 , see inset ) when @xmath44 ; and for @xmath45 the fraction of samples which has reached a full consensus decays slowly towards to zero as the scaled initial number @xmath32 of different opinions increases , as well the number @xmath40 of surviving opinions grows exponentially with @xmath32 and independent of @xmath15 . if the @xmath46 nodes or triad ( not shown ) convincing rule is considered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pluri_rule3 ] ) , only when @xmath47 the complete consensus ( @xmath43 , see inset ) is found in all the samples , for @xmath48 the fraction of samples decays slowly as @xmath32 increases and @xmath40 grows to values closer to @xmath32 , besides finite size effects appear ; when @xmath49 no sample reaches a consensus and @xmath40 roughly equals @xmath41 , that means everybody keeps its own opinion and a fixed point is reached soon .    additionally , we have also simulated the @xmath42 nodes convincing rule when only a fraction @xmath32 of individuals at the beginning of the simulation assumes an opinion .",
    "in contrast to the same rule analyzed above where the simulation starts with all the individuals having an opinion , in such way if @xmath50 some individuals can assume the same opinion , now @xmath51 individuals do not assume any opinion ( @xmath52 ) and they are convinced to follow the neighbor s opinion according to probability @xmath53 : a pair of neighbors in agreement convinces all the nodes connected with them with a probability for each of the two nodes inversely proportional to the time - independent number @xmath0 of nodes connected to it , @xmath54 . alternatively , this case can be associated as an election campaign when @xmath32 candidates try to persuade @xmath55 voters to vote for them . as in real elections",
    ", we do not wait for a kind of equilibrium state , but count the votes at some intermediate time .",
    "figure [ fig : votes ] shows the distribution of the number of candidates getting @xmath56 votes each at two different timesteps @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) . in agreement with findings for real elections which shows that the distribution of the number of candidates @xmath61 receiving a fraction of votes @xmath56 follows a power - law @xmath62 @xcite except for downward deviations at small and large numbers @xmath56 of votes , also our simulations obey this hyperbolic law including the deviations at the ends .",
    "by simulating the sznajd model of socio - physics on a more realistic network with stronger clustering , we have found a phase transition as a function of the initial concentration of @xmath63 opinions at @xmath27 : for @xmath64 all samples end up with @xmath65 , and for @xmath66 they all end up in the other fixed point @xmath63 , for large enough networks .",
    "this phase transition exists for @xmath42 nodes , @xmath46 nodes and triad convincing rule , however it does not exist for @xmath26 node convincing rule . instead of only two opinions , but considering many opinions",
    ", we notice that @xmath26 node convincing rule leads the system always to a complete consensus , while for the @xmath42 nodes convincing rule a full consensus is obtained when @xmath67 and if @xmath68 the final number of different opinions grows exponentially with the number @xmath32 of initial ones ; for @xmath46 nodes and triad convincing rules a full consensus is observed only for @xmath69 , if @xmath48 the fraction of samples decays slowly as @xmath32 increases and @xmath40 grows to values closer to @xmath32 and when @xmath49 the final number @xmath40 of different opinions roughly equals @xmath41 . when simple and minor changes are taken into account in the model ,",
    "the hyperbolic law observed empirically in real elections can be reproduced quite well .",
