    "graphene , a two - dimensional crystal of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , owes its extraordinary optical and electronic properties to the presence of dirac points in its bandstructure .",
    "the strong linear @xcite and nonlinear interaction @xcite of the massless dirac fermions ( mdfs ) with light , together with a tunable conductivity and broadband response , make graphene an attractive material for atomically - thin active devices operating at optical and terahertz frequencies , such as saturable absorbers @xcite , modulators @xcite , metamaterial devices @xcite , photo - detectors @xcite , and sensing applications @xcite .",
    "graphene s strong interaction with light is epitomized by its ability to support plasmons that are bound to the mono - atomic sheet of carbon @xcite .",
    "these collective excitations of the two - dimensional electron gas in form of charge density waves feature a strong spatial confinement of the electromagnetic energy to typically @xmath0 of the freespace wavelength or less @xcite , group velocities several hundred times lower than the vacuum speed of light @xcite , and tunable propagation characteristics controllable by chemical doping ( i.e. , using ionic gels ) or application of a gate voltage ( dc doping ) @xcite .",
    "although these properties are very attractive from an application perspective , graphene plasmons suffer from high losses at infrared wavelengths @xcite attributed to the presence of multiple damping pathways @xcite , such as collisions with impurities and phonons , as well as particle / hole generation via interband damping . arguably , the success of graphene as material for plasmonic applications depends on the development of strategies to control or compensate plasmonic losses .",
    "one such strategy is to supply gain via optical pumping .",
    "when graphene is excited by a short optical pulse , a hot non - equilibrium particle / hole distribution is created , that thermalizes rapidly within the bands to form an inverted carrier plasma in quasi - equilibrium , which provides gain over a wide range of frequencies @xcite . as a result of the inverted carrier state , plasmons are now not only subjected to interband absorption but can also experience amplification via stimulated emission @xcite .",
    "just as with interband absorption , the stimulated plasmon emission is equally enhanced by the concentration of field energy at the sheet that greatly increases the coupling of the plasmons to the particle / hole plasma .",
    "the possibility of overcoming plasmon losses at terahertz and infrared frequencies in photo - inverted graphene has been explored in refs .",
    "these studies offer first theoretical insight into the interplay of plasmons with particle / hole excitations via stimulated emission , but employ approximative expressions for the polarizability ( or conductivity ) , which do not establish the proper plasmon dispersion of inverted graphene .",
    "as both , the plasmon gain and emission rates depend critically on the plasmon dispersion and the derived density of states , it remains a matter of debate whether plasmon amplification is achievable under realistic conditions , i.e. under consideration of collision loss , doping , and temperature .",
    "the stimulated emission of plasmons in photo - inverted graphene is necessarily accompanied by the spontaneous emission of plasmons .",
    "contrary to plasmon amplification , spontaneous emission of plasmons is a broadband phenomenon that involves incoherent emission into all available modes .",
    "the concentration of the plasmon field energy to small volumes , their low group velocity , and the broadband gain all impact on the local density of optical states at the graphene sheet ( purcell factor ) , that causes the acceleration of the spontaneous plasmon emission processes . indeed , theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous plasmon emission provides an ultrafast channel for carrier recombination @xcite , that influences the non - equilibrium dynamics of hot carriers @xcite .",
    "only recently , transient carrier inversion has been observed in graphene by time- and angular - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( tr - arpes ) @xcite , and pump - probe experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments reveal that while the photo - excited hot carriers ( i.e. , dirac particles and holes ) thermalize quickly ( on a @xmath1 timescale ) within the conduction and valence band , they simultaneously undergo ultrafast recombination processes , limiting the life - time of the inversion to the @xmath2 timescale .",
    "as these recombination rates are too fast to be explained by optical phonon emission , which occurs on @xmath3 timescales , other recombination processes are likely to be responsible for the rapid loss of inversion .",
    "a candidate for this is the auger recombination of carriers , where the energy of a recombined particle / hole pair is transferred to a particle ( or hole ) that is then lifted into a higher state within its band .",
    "however , the rates for auger recombination depend critically on the model for the screened coulomb interaction between the carriers and thus remain subject to discussion @xcite .",
    "carrier recombination due to plasmon emission is another mechanism that affects the carrier life - times @xcite .",
    "first theoretical calculations predict ultrafast recombination rates in the @xmath4 range , depending on temperature and doping @xcite . the wide range of timescales and their relevance for the carrier relaxation dynamics motivate the refined calculations on the plasmon emission rates presented in this work under consideration of the exact non - equilibrium plasmon dispersion .    the relevance of plasmons for both non - equilibrium carrier dynamics and many - body effects in graphene can not be overstated .",
    "plasmons do not only contribute to the spontaneous recombination of carriers , but also to the self - energy of the carriers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , plasmons are associated with the poles of the screened coulomb potential , which in turn affects the interaction processes between charged particles , such as such as carrier - carrier scattering @xcite , auger recombination and impact ionization , as well as scattering with optical phonons @xcite and charged impurities @xcite . while the plasmon dispersion has been extensively studied in thermal equilibrium @xcite ,",
    "there is , until now , no general formalism that allows for the efficient calculation of the plasmon dispersion ( or the screening ) for _ arbitrary _ carrier distributions far from thermal equilibrium , although such a theory would be important to accurately calculate the interaction processes in hot carrier distributions created by ultra - short optical excitation .    in this article",
    "we investigate the properties of the plasmons in photo - inverted , gapless ( i.e. , free - standing ) graphene .",
    "the presented study can be broadly split into two parts .",
    "the first part seeks to clarify how carrier inversion affects the non - equilibrium plasmon dispersion and decay rate , and establishes the conditions under which coherent plasmon amplification becomes possible .",
    "the second part of this work concerns the incoherent , spontaneous emission of plasmons , which competes with the plasmon amplification for gain .    as a basis for our theoretical analysis",
    "we introduce a general theoretical framework for the non - equilibrium polarizability that is applicable to arbitrary carrier distributions in graphene ( section [ sec : noneqplas ] ) . in section [ sec : plasinverted ] this theory is used to calculate the exact ( complex - frequency ) plasmon dispersion for photo - inverted intrinsic graphene and compare the it to the plasmon dispersion in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in particular , we analyze how the stimulated excitation / de - excitation processes impact on the gain / loss spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gainspectrum ] ) and then how the doping level of the particle / hole plasmas affects the plasmon dispersion curves and the associated gain spectra .",
    "the initial studies for a zero temperature and collision - free particle / hole plasma are followed by calculations that incorporate temperature and collision loss ( see section [ sec : collandtemp ] ) .",
    "the results exemplify that plasmon amplification is possible under realistic assumptions of temperature and collision loss , even for relatively low levels of inversion .    in section [ sec : plasgainspec ]",
    "we evaluate the plasmon emission spectra and spontaneous emission rates and compare the exact results with approximative results obtained from fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) . as part of this analysis we study the impact of collision loss and temperature on the spontaneous emission rates , and establish that spontaneous plasmon emission is significantly faster than previous estimates suggest .",

    "graphene supports two types of plasmons , associated with the longitudinal density - density response and the transverse current - current response of the mdf plasma @xcite . within the field of plasmonics , these collective excitations",
    "are frequently referred to as tm ( transverse magnetic ) and te ( transverse electric ) plasmons according to the polarization of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "in contrast to the conventional strongly bound tm plasmons , te plasmons are weakly bound and can only exist under certain restrictive conditions , such as low temperatures or a high - permittivity environment @xcite . for the present study on plasmon gain ,",
    "we only consider tm - polarized longitudinal plasmons , as these plasmons couple more strongly to the particle / hole plasma @xcite and thus constitute the dominant channel for stimulated and spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of tm graphene plasmons can be obtained by solving maxwell s equations for bound tm waves .",
    "for graphene suspended in air , neglecting wave retardation ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , this gives @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , the non - local sheet conductivity , describes the linear current response to an applied electric field with in - plane wavevector @xmath12 and frequency @xmath13 .",

    "one of the main objectives of this work is to determine the gain spectrum of plasmons in photo - inverted graphene .",
    "this involves consideration of regimes where plasmons are strongly amplified or damped as they couple to the particle / hole plasma via stimulated emission and absorption processes .",
    "we therefore do not make the usual low - loss approximation , which treats the plasmon frequency as a purely real variable and extracts the gain / decay rate perturbatively , but instead seek the _ exact _ complex - frequency plasmon dispersion ( cfpd ) , as explained in the following .",
