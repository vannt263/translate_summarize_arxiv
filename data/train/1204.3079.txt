    "bonner @xcite had demonstrated that the equilibrium of a finite isothermal gas cloud under its self - gravity could be unstable as the mass increases .",
    "mestel @xcite solved the collapse equation of a cold cloud with @xmath5 as the trajectory velocity , which is the lagrangian fluid representation , to obtain the celebrated self - similar parametric solution .",
    "lin @xcite showed that an oblate cold spheroid would evolve to a disk and a prolate one would evolve to a spindle .",
    "bodenheimer and sweigart @xcite studied numerically the evolution sequence of a collapsing gas cloud with finite preesure again with @xmath5 under different initial density distributions and different surface boundary conditions .",
    "penston @xcite analyzed analytically the lagrangian cold collapse with a smooth maximum for density , and also put forward a self - similar analysis of an isothermal collapsing sphere in eulerian description , where the fluid velocity @xmath6 as one of the variables .",
    "larson @xcite examined numerically through a set of conservation equations of mass , momentum , and energy in eulerian representation the formation of a protostar , and presented in appendix c the isothermal similarity solutions .",
    "shu @xcite studied anew the homologous collapse of an isothermal sphere with the eulerian conservation equations .",
    "he interpreted the singular solutions , where the coefficients of the nonlinear differential equations vanish , and constructed the expansion - wave , inside - out collapse scenario .",
    "hunter @xcite added a new class of isothermal self - similar solutions on previously known ones .",
    "goldreich and weber @xcite examined the homologous collapse of a stellar core with a polytropic equation of state , and arrived at a differential equation that describes the radial structure .",
    "perturbation analysis was used to study the nonspherical modes of the stellar core .",
    "whitworth and summers @xcite brought to the attention the importance of the stability of the initial isothermal gas cloud and the external driving pressure .",
    "these two factors transform each known solution into a continum .",
    "recently , there have been renewed efforts on gravitational collapse .",
    "fatuzzo @xcite , lou and wang @xcite , lou and gao @xcite have considered self - similar solutions in eulerian form with polytropic equation of state , and presented innovated solutions for astrophysical phenomena . furthermore , lou and shen @xcite put forward the envelope - expansion ( ee ) and core - collapse ( cc ) solution for an isothermal cloud . this eecc solution is to model outflowing stellar winds while the red giant collapses .",
    "bian and lou @xcite examined the shock flows of an isothermal sphere to better understand the shock structure .",
    "we remark that , except cold gas clouds , clouds with isothermal or polytropic equation of state have been treated under eulerian fluid description where velocity @xmath7 is one of the variables .",
    "the time dependence of each variable is constructed as some specific power of time @xmath8 .",
    "the spatial dependence is given by a set of nonlinear differential equations @xcite .",
    "the singular solutions of this system define the singular sonic surfaces , which separate subsonic and supersonic regions in the @xmath4 two - parameter space . along the sonic surfaces , the flow is subsonic / supersonic relative to the similarity @xmath9 profile .",
    "collapse solutions cross from subsonic to supersonic regions along the sonic lines .",
    "sometimes shock waves are needed to bridge the crossing to meet the boundary conditions . aimed to describe the collapse , representing the time dependence with different powers of a linear time scaling for different variables would certainly fail to describe the time history of collapse .",
    "we could only expect such self - similar solutions with a linear time scaling be valid during a specific time span and over a specific radial interval . here , we use the alternative lagrangian description , where the fluid velocity is not a variable , to construct the self - similar collapse having a polytropic equation of state .",
    "the evolution function is solved consistently together with the spatial structures .",
    "gravitational collapse of a spherical cloud is described by @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the mass density , @xmath12 is the gas cloud velocity , @xmath13 is the gas pressure , @xmath14 is the polytropic index , @xmath15 is a point mass at the center , if any , and @xmath16 is the gas mass within a sphere of radius @xmath17 at time @xmath8 where @xmath18 we note that eq .",

    "for a spherical collapse with @xmath22 , we use lagrangian fluid representation with @xmath23 , where the lagrangian label @xmath3 is the initial position of the fluid element , and @xmath1 is the dimensionless evolution function with @xmath24 that describes the time history of the fluid element . the velocity can then be written as @xmath25 contrary to the eulerian fluid description , the fluid velocity @xmath6 here is not a variable which substantially simplifies the analysis .",
    "we now transform the eulerian independent variables @xmath26 to lagrangian independent variables @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , we note that the total time derivative in eulerian representation @xmath28 corresponds to the partial time derivative in lagrangian representation @xmath29 .",
    "we now write the variables in saparable form of @xmath30 and @xmath3 , and try to determine the evolution function @xmath1 and the spatial configuration in @xmath3 under similarity .",

    "the peak about @xmath83 corresponds to the central core , and the oscillating part amounts to the external envelope",
    ".    this spherical oscillating envelope structure of @xmath109 could be very relevant to protostar planetary system .",
    "the locations of the gaseous planets would be given by the oscillating peaks of @xmath78 .",
    "in the presence of rotation , as collapse proceeds , the spherical cloud would flatten to the equatorial plane , and the high density shells in the spherical cloud would become dense rings in the equatorial disk forming gaseous planets . rotation would also stabilize the planets on their orbits as the central pre - protostar continues to collapse . since the peaks are decreasing in amplitude , the gaseous planets would have a decreasing mass as distance increases .",
    "this happens to be the case of the giant planets of our solar system , with the exception of uranus which has its rotational axis on the ecliptic plane indicating a possible collision with substantial mass loss .",
    "the fact that the boundary condition at @xmath96 for equilibrium with @xmath99 differs from that for collapse with @xmath110 should not cause concern .",
    "any self - similar solution , either eulerian or lagrangian , relies on writing the temporal and spatial dependences of any dynamic variable in separable form .",
    "this excludes the initial period of evolution of the real system , which is not amenable to similarity treatment . as a result ,",
    "the self - similar initial time @xmath111 is not the initial time @xmath112 of the real collapsing system .",
    "thus , the homologous boundary condition at @xmath111 need not be the boundary condition of equilibrium .",
    "for @xmath113 and with a smaller @xmath84 , the first minimum plunges to negative @xmath102 as in fig.4 , and becomes positive again at @xmath114 . as a result ,",
    "the external part becomes disconnected physically from the central core , and a cavity is formed between the central core and the external envelope .",
    "the envelope will collapse under the gravitational field of the core plus the self - gravity .",
    "such a configuration is most relevant to pre - supernova ( magnetar - in - a - cavity model @xcite ) .",
    "the envelope of this disconnected system is described by @xmath115 where the integral @xmath116 starts at a disconnected @xmath117 . with @xmath45 and neglecting the self - gravity @xmath116 , we have the monotonic envelope profile of @xmath118",
    "this model has two parameters @xmath32 and @xmath42 to normalize time @xmath8 and radial coordinate @xmath3 , that need to be determined . to obtain these two important parameters ,",
    "we begin with observations of a collapsed configuration , such as swift @xcite . observing the central core dimension , we denote it by @xmath119 which separates from the first minimum .",

    "with @xmath83 determined by observations , we get the analytic solution of @xmath124 with a given @xmath75 .",
    "we choose @xmath125 such that the inflection point @xmath126 to get @xmath127 with @xmath24 and @xmath122 estimated , we can construct backwards in time the position @xmath119 at @xmath111 giving @xmath128 if the collapsed configuration allows the identification of the number of oscillations on the envelope , we can compare with the analytic @xmath124 to locate @xmath96 . by estimating the total mass m of the collapsed configuration",
    ", we then have @xmath129 which gives @xmath32 as the mass in unit volume of @xmath130 .",
    "with @xmath32 and @xmath42 determined , we go back to the parameter @xmath125 to get @xmath131 .",
    "we now calculate @xmath132 since @xmath124 oscillates about unity , @xmath116 needs to be integrated in @xmath106 .",
    "however , @xmath133 can be evaluated easily as above , since the collapse is merely a redistribution of densities of an initially uniform sphere with @xmath134 , thus giving the second equility of the above equation .    in the eulerian formulation ,",
    "the singular sonic surfaces divide the @xmath4 two - parameter space in subsonic and supersonic regions , where the flow is subsonic / supersonic relative to the similarity profile @xcite .",
    "complete collapse solutions have to cross these regions on the sonic lines . in our lagrangian formulation , the fluid velocity , which is not a variable , and the sound speed are @xmath135 we define the time dependent sonic function @xmath136 with @xmath137 and @xmath138 , the spatial part @xmath139 is shown in fig.5 with oscillations in @xmath106 . at @xmath111 with @xmath89 , the time dependent sonic function @xmath140 everywhere .",
