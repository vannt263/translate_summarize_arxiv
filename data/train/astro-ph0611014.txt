    "thermal emission from neutron stars can be used to measure the magnetic field , temperature , and composition of neutron - star envelopes , and to constrain the properties of matter under extreme conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . to achieve these goals",
    ", one should use reliable models of the atmosphere or condensed surface , where the thermal spectrum is formed , and of deeper layers , which provide thermal insulation of hot stellar interiors . in these layers , the effects of strong magnetic fields can be important . in recent years , significant progress has been achieved in the theoretical description of neutron - star envelopes with strong magnetic fields , but new challenges are put forward by observations of magnetars . in sect .",
    "[ sect:1 ] we briefly overview recent work on the construction of models of neutron star atmospheres with strong magnetic fields and on the modeling of spectra of thermal radiation formed in an atmosphere or at a condensed surface .",
    "we list important unsolved theoretical problems which arise in this modeling . in sect .",
    "[ sect:2 ] , after a brief review of the effects of strong magnetic fields on the thermal structure and effective temperature of neutron stars , we describe our new calculations of the thermal structure .",
    "compared to the previous results @xcite , we have taken into account neutrino energy losses in the outer crust of the star .",
    "we show that neutrino emission strongly affects the temperature profile in a sufficiently hot neutron star and places an upper limit on its surface temperature @xmath5 and photon luminosity @xmath6 .",
    "it was realized long ago @xcite that a neutron star atmosphere model should properly include the effects of a strong magnetic field and partial ionization . models of _ fully ionized _",
    "neutron star atmospheres with strong magnetic fields were constructed by several research groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the most recent papers highlighted the effects that can be important for atmospheres of magnetars : the ion cyclotron feature @xcite and vacuum polarization , including a conversion of normal radiation modes propagating in the magnetized atmosphere @xcite .",
    "early studies of _ partial ionization _ in the magnetized neutron star atmospheres ( e.g. , rajagopal , romani , & miller @xcite ; reviewed by @xcite ) were based on an oversimplified treatment of atomic physics and nonideal plasma effects in strong magnetic fields . at typical parameters ,",
    "the effects of thermal motion of bound species are important .",
    "so far these effects have been taken into account only for hydrogen plasmas .",
    "thermodynamic functions , absorption coefficients , the dielectric tensor and polarization vectors of normal radiation modes in a strongly magnetized , partially ionized hydrogen plasma have been obtained and used to calculate radiative opacities and thermal radiation spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the summary of the magnetic hydrogen atmosphere models and the list of references is given by @xcite .",
    "the model is sufficiently reliable at @xmath7  g @xmath8  g , i.e. , in the field range typical of isolated radio pulsars .",
    "it provides realistic spectra of thermal x - ray radiation @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended this model to higher @xmath4 .",
    "however , there remain the following unsolved theoretical problems that prevent to obtain reliable results beyond the indicated field range .    *",
    "the calculated spectra at @xmath9  g depend on the adopted model of mode conversion owing to the vacuum resonance and on the description of the propagation of photons with frequencies below the plasma frequency .",
    "neither of these problems has been definitely solved .",
    "their solution is also important for modeling the low - frequency ( uv and optical ) tail of the spectrum .",
    "* at low @xmath10 or high @xmath4 , hydrogen atoms recombine in h@xmath11 molecules and eventually form a condensed phase ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : surf ] ) .",
    "corresponding quantum - mechanical data are very incomplete .",
    "* at @xmath12  g , transition rates of moving h atoms have not been calculated because of their complexity .",
    "there is the only one calculation of the energy spectrum of bound states appropriate to this range of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "* a more rigorous treatment of radiative transfer in the atmosphere requires solving the transfer equations for the stokes parameters which has not been done so far for partially ionized atmospheres ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the cases of fully ionized atmospheres ) .",
    "finally , we note that it is still not possible to calculate accurate atmospheric spectra at @xmath13  g for chemical elements other than hydrogen , because of the importance of the effects of motion of atomic nuclei in the strong magnetic fields .",
    "apart from the h atom , these effects have been calculated only for the he atom @xcite , which _ rests _ as a whole , but has a moving nucleus , and for the he@xmath14 ion ( @xcite ; pavlov & bezchastnov @xcite ) .",
    "the data of astrophysical relevance for he@xmath14 are partly published and partly in preparation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; one expects to have a he / he@xmath14 magnetic atmosphere model available in the near future .",
    "the notion that an isolated magnetic neutron star has a condensed surface was first put forward by @xcite , who considered the iron surface . @xcite and @xcite studied the phase diagram of strongly magnetized hydrogen and showed that , when the surface temperature @xmath5 falls below some critical value ( dependent of @xmath4 ) , the atmosphere can undergo a phase transition into a condensed state .",
    "a similar phase transition occurs for the equation of state of partially ionized , nonideal , strongly magnetized hydrogen plasma , constructed by potekhin , chabrier , & saumon ( @xcite ) for @xmath15  g and extended by @xcite to the magnetar field strengths .",
    "it is analogous to the `` plasma phase transition '' suggested in plasma physics at @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , chabrier , saumon , & potekhin @xcite for discussion and references ) . according to potekhin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the critical point for the phase transition in the hydrogen plasma is located at the density @xmath17 g  @xmath3 and temperature @xmath18  k , where @xmath19  g. at @xmath20 the density @xmath21 of the condensed phase increases up to a few times of @xmath22 . on the other hand , according to @xcite , the surface density of a condensed phase for heavy elements is @xmath23 g  @xmath3 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the charge and mass numbers of the ions .",
    "these two estimates of @xmath21 are in qualitative agreement .",
    "@xcite estimates the critical temperature of hydrogen as @xmath26  k ( @xmath27 being the cohesive energy ) , also in agreement with the above estimate .",
    "@xcite calculated the cohesive energy for ne and fe at @xmath7  g@xmath28  g , using the density functional theory ( dft ) and obtained @xmath29 kev .",
    "recently , @xcite performed dft calculations of the cohesive energies for zero - pressure condensed hydrogen , helium , carbon , and iron at @xmath7  g @xmath30  g. for instance , they found that the cohesive energy per carbon atom ranges from @xmath31 ev at @xmath32  g to 20 kev at @xmath33  g. the cohesive energy per iron atom varies from @xmath34 kev at @xmath35  g to 33 kev at @xmath33  g. these calculations suggest @xmath36 of the same order of magnitude as the above estimate for hydrogen .",
    "note that the models of @xcite and @xcite are constructed in the framework of the `` chemical picture '' of plasmas , whose validity near the plasma phase transition can be questionable @xcite .",
    "thus the position ( and the very existence ) of the condensed surface requires further theoretical investigation and experimental or observational verification .",
    "hopefully , this can be done by analyzing observations of thermal emission from neutron stars .",
    "the thermal emission from the magnetized surface was studied by @xcite , turolla , zane , & drake ( @xcite ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the spectrum exhibits modest deviations from blackbody across a wide energy range , and shows mild absorption features associated with the ion cyclotron frequency ( energy @xmath37 ev ) and the electron plasma frequency ( energy @xmath38 ev , where @xmath39 is in g  @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the predictions of the ion cyclotron feature and the spectrum at lower frequencies are not firm .",
    "the uncertainty arises from motion of the ions in the electromagnetic field around their equilibrium lattice positions .",
    "most of the models treat the ions as fixed ( non - moving ) .",
    "only @xcite considered two limits of fixed and free ions . in reality , however , the ions are neither fixed nor completely free ( see @xcite for estimates of possible uncertainties ) .",
    "in addition , the condensed surface of a neutron star can be surrounded by a `` thin '' atmosphere , which is transparent to x - rays , but optically thick at lower wavelengths .",
    "such a hypothesis has been first invoked by @xcite for explaining the spectrum of the isolated neutron star rx j0720.4@xmath403125 .",
    "recently , the hydrogen atmosphere model , described in sect .",
    "[ sect : atm ] , together with the condensed surface emission model of @xcite have been successfully used for fitting the spectrum of the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5@xmath403754 @xcite ( assuming the atmosphere to be `` thin '' as defined above ) .",
    "the link between the magnetized atmosphere and stellar interior is provided by a _ heat blanketing ( insulating ) envelope_. the solution of heat transport problem relates the effective surface temperature @xmath5 to the temperature @xmath41 at the inner boundary of the blanketing envelope . without a magnetic field , it is conventional to place the inner boundary at @xmath42 g  @xmath3 . in this case , it can be treated in the quasi - newtonian approximation with fractional errors @xmath43 @xcite . a strong magnetic field , however ,",
    "greatly affects heat transport and , consequently , the thermal structure of the envelope .",
    "the thermal structure of neutron star envelopes with radial magnetic fields ( normal to the surface ) was studied by @xcite ( also see @xcite for references to earlier work ) .",
    "his principal conclusion was that the field reduces the thermal insulation of the heat blanketing envelope due to the landau quantization of electron motion .",
    "the thermal structure of the envelope with magnetic fields normal and tangential to the surface was analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the tangential field increases the thermal insulation of the envelope , because the larmor rotation of electrons reduces the transverse electron thermal conductivity .",
    "the case of arbitrary angle @xmath44 between the field lines and the normal to the surface was studied by @xcite in the approximation of constant ( density and temperature independent ) longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivities .",
    "the authors proposed a simple formula which expresses @xmath5 at arbitrary @xmath44 through two values of @xmath5 calculated at @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the case of arbitrary @xmath44 was studied also by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite reconsidered the thermal structure of blanketing iron envelopes for any @xmath44 , using improved thermal conductivities @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed accreted blanketing envelopes composed of light elements . in agreement with an earlier conjecture of @xcite and simplified treatments of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", they demonstrated that the dipole magnetic field ( unlike the radial one ) does not necessarily increase the total stellar luminosity @xmath6 at a given @xmath41 . on the contrary ,",
    "the field @xmath47@xmath48  g lowers @xmath6 , and only the fields @xmath9 g significantly increase it .",
    "@xcite shifted the inner boundary of the blanketing envelope to the neutron drip , @xmath49 g  @xmath3 , because in some cases they found a non - negligible temperature drop at @xmath50 g  @xmath3 .",
    "they obtained that magnetized accreted envelopes are generally more heat - transparent than non - accreted ones ( the same is true in the field - free case , studied by @xcite ) .",
    "however , this heat transparency enhancement is less significant , when the transparency is already enhanced by a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "recently @xcite showed that qualitatively the same dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath4 and on the chemical composition holds not only for dipole , but also for small - scale field configurations .",
    "@xcite studied heat - blanketing envelopes with a magnetic field anchored either in the core or in the inner crust of the star ( with dipole and toroidal field components of different strengths ) .",
    "they showed that a superstrong field in the inner crust of a not too hot star can significantly affect the surface temperature distribution and make it nonuniform and even asymmetric , with hot spots having different temperatures .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite , who also evaluated pulsed fractions and phase - dependent spectra of neutron stars with strong magnetic fields anchored in the inner crust .",
    "magnetars differ from ordinary pulsars in two respects : they possess superstrong surface magnetic fields , and they are generally younger and hotter .",
    "the first circumstance suggests to extend the heat - blanketing layer to deeper layers ( at least to the neutron drip density as was done by @xcite ) .",
    "the second indicates that neutrino emission can be important in the heat - blanketing envelopes .",
    "accordingly , we have modified our computer code , which calculates the thermal structure @xcite , to make it fully relativistic and to allow for energy sinks during heat diffusion .",
    "a complete set of equations for mechanical and thermal structure of a spherically symmetric star in hydrostatic equilibrium has been derived by @xcite .",
    "they can easily be transformed to the form valid in an envelope of a star with radial heat transport , anisotropic ( slowly varying ) temperature distribution over any spherical layer , and a force - free magnetic field .",
    "assuming quasistationary heat transport and neutrino emission , these equations reduce to the following system of ordinary differential equations for the metric function ( gravitational potential ) @xmath51 , the local heat flux @xmath52 , temperature @xmath10 , and gravitational mass @xmath53 , contained within a sphere of circumferential radius @xmath54 , as functions of pressure @xmath55 : @xmath56 here @xmath39 is the mass density ( equivalent energy density of the matter ) , @xmath57 is the net energy loss per unit volume ( @xmath58 is the neutrino emissivity in our case , although generally @xmath59 , @xmath60 being the heat deposition rate , e.g. , due to nuclear reactions ) , @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the opacity , @xmath63 is the so - called `` baryon mass density , '' @xmath64 is the baryon number density , @xmath65 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath66 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath67 is the local gravity , and @xmath68 is the gravitational constant . furthermore , @xmath69 are general relativistic corrections to radius , enthalpy and surface gravity , respectively .",

    "<S> strong ( @xmath0 g ) and superstrong ( @xmath1 g ) magnetic fields profoundly affect many thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of dense plasmas in neutron star envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they produce strongly anisotropic thermal conductivity in the neutron star crust and modify the equation of state and radiative opacities in the atmosphere , which are major ingredients of the cooling theory and spectral atmosphere models . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , both the radiation spectrum and the thermal luminosity of a neutron star can be affected by the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review these effects and demonstrate the influence of magnetic field strength on the thermal structure of an isolated neutron star , putting emphasis on the differences brought about by the superstrong fields and high temperatures of magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter objects , it is important to take proper account of a combined effect of the magnetic field on thermal conduction and neutrino emission at densities @xmath2 g  @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the neutrino emission puts a @xmath4-dependent upper limit on the effective surface temperature of a cooling neutron star . </S>"
