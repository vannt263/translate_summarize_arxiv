    "double beta decay ( @xmath3 ) is a very rare nuclear transition in which a nucleus with z protons decays into a nucleus with z+2 protons and same mass number a. it can only be observed in those isotopes where the @xmath4 decay mode is forbidden due to the energy of the daughter nuclei being higher than the energy of the parent nuclei , or highly suppressed .",
    "two decay modes are usually considered : the standard two - neutrino mode ( @xmath5 ) , which has been observed in several isotopes with typical half - lives in the range of @xmath6 years  @xcite , and the neutrinoless mode ( @xmath7 ) , which violates lepton - number conservation , and is therefore forbidden in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "an observation of @xmath7 would prove that neutrinos are majorana particles , that is , identical to their antiparticles  @xcite , and would provide direct information on neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "besides , it would demonstrate that total lepton number is violated , a result that can be linked to the cosmic asymmetry between matter and antimatter through the process known as leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the half - life of @xmath7 , if mediated by light , majorana neutrino exchange , can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an exactly - calculable phase - space integral for the emission of two electrons ; @xmath10 is the nuclear matrix element of the transition , which has to be evaluated theoretically ; and @xmath11 is the effective majorana mass of the electron neutrino : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the neutrino mass eigenstates and @xmath14 are elements of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the aim of all @xmath7 experiments is to measure the decay rate of this disintegration .",
    "however , the measurement is limited by the experimental sensitivity of the detector employed , which can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the isotope mass , @xmath17 is the energy resolution , @xmath18 is the background rate , @xmath19 is the detection efficiency and @xmath20 is a term which includes nuclear matrix elements  @xcite .    due to the presence of the two neutrino mode , together with background events which can fall in the energy region of interest ( roi ) where the neutrinoless mode is expected , @xmath17 is a must to resolve the possible @xmath7 events . in addition , an appropriate selection of detector components and surroundings",
    "should be done in such a way to reduce background rate as low as possible . besides , current generation of @xmath7 experiments",
    "have explored the region of neutrino masses corresponding to 160 - 250  mev ( depending of n.m.e . )  @xcite by using from tens to a few hundred kilos of isotope mass .",
    "the non detection of a signal creates the necessity of increase the isotope mass in the new generation up to the ton scale to explore new areas .",
    "the next experiment combines good energy resolution , a low background rate and the possibility to scale - up the detector to large masses of @xmath3 isotope by using a high - pressure xenon gas ( hpxe ) electroluminescent ( el ) time projection chamber ( tpc ) to search for @xmath7 in @xmath0xe .",
    "whit this technology , an energy resolution better than 1%  fwhm can be achieved in next at q@xmath2 of xe thanks to the small fano factor of gaseous xenon ( @xmath21 )  @xcite , compared with other media such as liquid xenon ( lxe ) ( @xmath22 ) , together with the low fluctuations introduced by an el - based amplification .",
    "besides , hpxe provides topological information of the events , allowing to discriminate between signal events ( a twisted track of about 10  cm long , with two energy depositions at both ends ) from background events ( single electrons with only one blob at the end and most of the time accompanied by an x - ray  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0xe constitutes 8.86% of all natural xenon , but the enrichment process is relatively simple and cheap compared to that of other @xmath3 isotopes , thus making @xmath0xe the most obvious candidate for a future multi - ton experiment .",
    "the detection process in next implies independent systems for tracking and calorimetry .",
    "particles interacting in the hpxe transfer their energy to the medium ionizing and exciting its atoms .",
    "the excitation energy is manifested in the prompt emission of vuv @xmath23 scintillation light .",
    "the ionization electrons drift toward the tpc anode thanks to the presence of a moderate electric field , entering in a region with an even more intense electric field . there , secondary vuv photons are generated isotropically by electroluminescence .",
    "therefore both scintillation and ionization produce an optical signal , to be detected with a plane of pmts ( the energy plane ) located behind a transparent cathode .",
    "the detection of the primary scintillation light constitutes the start - of - event , whereas the detection of el light provides an energy measurement .",
    "electroluminescent light provides tracking as well , since it is detected a few millimeters away from production at the anode plane , via an array of mppcs ( the tracking plane ) .",
    "to demonstrate that the next concept is feasible , a scaled prototype , next - demo , was developed .",
    "next - demo is a cylindrical pressure vessel made of stainless steel , able to withstand up to 20  bar of internal pressure .",
    "it is 60  cm long and 30  cm in diameter , and holds @xmath24  1.5  kg of xe at 10  bar .",
    "three wire grids , the cathode , gate and anode , limit the two active regions of the tpc . the primary scintillation light is directly detected by a plane of 19 hamamatsu r7378a pmts behind the cathode grid .",
    "electroluminescent light produced by ionization electrons , is once again detected in the energy plane but the forward going photons are also detected in an array of 256 tetraphenyl butadiene ( tpb ) coated hamamatsu s10362 - 11 - 050p sipms .",
    "the tracking plane is used to reconstruct the position of energy deposits and , ultimately , the topology of an event as a whole .    in this prototype ,",
    "the abundance of xenon k - shell x - ray emission during data taking with a @xmath1na source has been identified as a multitool for the characterisation of the fundamental parameters of the gas as well as the equalisation of the response of the detector  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using these events is that they are distributed all over the volume of the detector and the range of the @xmath2430  kev electrons produced is small , around 0.6  mm at 10 bar  @xcite , releasing almost all their energy in a single point .",
    "such depositions have been used to extract correction factors which describe the detector geometry effects .",
    "in addition , both loss of charge due to electron attachment with gas impurities and temporal fluctuations during the el generation due to temperature and pressure oscillations have been corrected .",
    "the mentioned corrections have been applied to the reconstructed energy released by gammas coming from a @xmath1na ( see  @xcite ) , where an energy resolution for the k@xmath25 peak ( 29.7  kev ) and photopeak ( 511  kev ) of ( 5.691 @xmath26 0.003)% fwhm and ( 1.62 @xmath26 0.01)% fwhm were extracted respectively . independently extrapolating these two values to the @xmath0xe @xmath27 assuming the dominance of photon shot noise poisson statistics results in a predicted energy resolution at @xmath27 of 0.6256% fwhm and 0.7353% fwhm respectively .",
    "following the previous ideas , the next collaboration plans to build the next-100 detector , described in  @xcite , which will be formed by a hpxe tpc containing 100  kg of xenon , enriched at 90% in its @xmath0xe isotope , at 15  bar .",
    "the pressure vessel is built with low activity stainless steel , and contains an inner copper shield , 12  cm thick and made of radio pure copper , to attenuate the radiation coming from the high - energy gammas emitted in the decays of @xmath28tl and @xmath29bi , present in the external detector .",
    "the energy measurement in next-100 is provided by a total of 60 hamamatsu r11410 - 10 photomultipliers ( pmts ) covering 32.5% of the cathode area constitute the energy plane .",
    "this pmt model has been specially developed for radiopure , xenon - based detectors .",
    "the tracking function is provided by an array of around 7200 sipms , 1  cm pitch , located behind the el region , and coated with tpb .",
    "all materials present in the next-100 detector have been chosen according to rigorous radiopurity requirements , which together with the detection technique employed by next , produce an expected background rate of 5@xmath3010@xmath31 counts/(kg@xmath30kev@xmath30year )  @xcite .",
    "after 5 years of data taking , a sensitivity of 5.9@xmath3010@xmath32 years is predicted or , in terms of the effective neutrino majorana mass m@xmath2 , a value of around 100 mev , making next one of the most competitive experiments in the field  @xcite .",
    "next-100 is approved for operation in the laboratorio subterrneo de canfranc ( lsc ) , in spain , where the installation of seismic platform , lead castle , gas system , emergency recovery system and vessel are already completed .",
    "underground operations with non - enriched xenon will start in 2015 and the physics case with enriched xenon is planned for early 2016 .",
    "the search for @xmath7 is one of the major current challenges in neutrino physics . due to the high sensitivity provided by a hpxe tpc with el amplification ,",
    "next-100 promises to be one of the leading experiments in the field , exploring the region of neutrino mass down to 100  mev .",
    "one of its prototypes , next - demo , has demonstrated the main issues of such technology , helping in the design of the final detector .",
    "in addition , xenon k - shell x - ray depositions have been identified as a useful tool for the characterization of this type of detectors , providing the spatial calibration needed for close - to - optimal energy resolution .",
