    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the mixing between the quark flavours in weak interaction is parameterized by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which is a @xmath14 unitary matrix",
    ". since the ckm matrix elements are fundamental parameters of the sm , precise determinations of these elements are necessary and very important in testing the sm and searching for new physics ( np ) .",
    "since the effects of strong interactions and weak interaction can be well separated in semileptonic @xmath15 decays , these decays are excellent processes from which we can determine the magnitude of ckm matrix element @xmath16 . in the sm , neglecting the lepton mass , the tree - level differential decay rate in absence of radiative correction for @xmath1 process is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fermi constant , @xmath19 is the three momentum of the @xmath20 meson in the rest frame of the @xmath15 meson , @xmath0 is the four momentum transfer - squared , i.e. the invariant mass of the lepton and neutrino system , and @xmath21 is the form factor which parameterizes the effect of strong interaction .",
    "in addition to extraction of @xmath6 , the precise measurements of the @xmath4 semileptonic form factor is also very important to validate the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculation of the form factor .",
    "if the lqcd calculation of the form factor pass the test with the precisely measured form factor for @xmath1 decay , the uncertainty of the semileptonic @xmath22 decay form factor calculated in lqcd would be reduced .",
    "this would help in reducing the uncertainty of the measured @xmath23 from semileptonic @xmath22 decays  @xcite .",
    "the improved measurement of @xmath23 from semileptonic @xmath22 decay will improve the determination of the @xmath24 unitarity triangle , with which one can more precisely test the sm and search for np .    in the past decades ,",
    "copious measurements of branching fractions and/or decay rates for @xmath1 decays were performed at more than ten experiments . by comprehensive analysis of these existing measurements together with @xmath6 from sm global fit or together with form factor @xmath7 calculated in lqcd , one can precisely determine the form factor @xmath7 or extract @xmath6 . in this article , we report the determination of @xmath7 or extraction of @xmath6 by analyzing all of these existing measurements of the semileptonic @xmath1 decays in conjunction with @xmath6 from sm global fit or with the form factor @xmath7 calculated in lattice qcd . in the following sections , we first review the experimental measurements of branching fractions and decay rates for @xmath1 decays in section  [ sec : expt ] .",
    "we then describe our comprehensive analysis procedure for dealing with these measurements to obtain the product of @xmath7 and @xmath6 in section  [ sec : ana ] . in section  [ sec : rslt ] , we present the final results of our comprehensive analysis of these measurements .",
    "we finally give a summary for the determination of @xmath7 and the extraction of @xmath6 in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "in 1989 , the tagged photon spectrometer collaboration studied the @xmath25 decays and found 250 signal events for @xmath25 decays at the e691 experiment .",
    "based on these events , they measured the ratio of decay rates @xmath26   @xcite .    in 1991 , by analyzing 490 pb@xmath27 data collected with the cleo detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) , the cleo collaboration made a measurement of the branching ratio of @xmath28 semileptonic decays .",

    ".    all above mentioned measurements are relative measurements which could not be used directly to determine the form factor @xmath7 or @xmath6 . to use these measurements to determine @xmath7 or @xmath6",
    ", we should first transfer these measurements into absolute decay rates in certain @xmath0 range .",
    "the absolute decay rate @xmath40 can be obtained from the measured relative decay branching ratio @xmath41 by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the branching fraction for @xmath39 or @xmath44 decays , and @xmath45 is the lifetime of @xmath15 meson . to avoid the possible correlations , here",
    "we use the value of the branching fraction of @xmath39 decay , @xmath46 , which is the average of the measurements from babar  @xcite , cleo - c  @xcite , cleo - ii  @xcite , aleph  @xcite , and argus  @xcite . for the branching fraction of @xmath47 decay",
