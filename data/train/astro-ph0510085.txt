    "first revealed by _ einstein _ , the population of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) has increasingly grown up in the last decade mainly thanks to the observations of _ rosat _",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) , _ xmm - newton _ ( e.g. @xcite ) and _ chandra _ ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "about 150 ulxs are included in the recent _ chandra _ catalogue of @xcite .",
    "these point - like sources have x - ray luminosities @xmath4 erg  s@xmath5 , in excess of that of a @xmath6 compact object accreting at the eddington limit .",
    "variability in the x - ray flux on timescales of months is observed in about half of the _ rosat _ ulxs with multiple observations @xcite , while about 5 - 15% of the _ chandra _ ulxs show variability during a single observation ( average exposure time @xmath7 40 ks , @xcite ) .    for several sources with sufficiently good statistics , the best fit to the x - ray spectrum",
    "is obtained with a two - component model , a soft multicolor disk ( mcd ) blackbody plus a power law .",
    "some ulxs show typical temperatures of the mcd component 5 - 10 times lower than those of galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "the high luminosity , the very soft thermal component ( if it represents the emission from a cool accretion disk ) and the variability suggest that these sources may be powered by accretion onto an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) of 100 - 1000 @xmath8 . nevertheless , many of the ulx properties can be explained if they do not emit isotropically @xcite or are dominated by emission from a relativistic jet ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", they may harbor stellar mass bhs and may be similar to galactic black hole binaries .",
    "multiwavelength observations are definitely a powerful tool to investigate the nature of ulxs .",
    "radio emission , when present , gives important clues on the geometry , energetics and lifetime of ulxs @xcite .",
    "optical follow - ups are crucial to identify ulx counterparts and clean up the population from the significant contamination of background agns and interacting sne @xcite . up to now only a very small number of ulxs have been convincingly associated with stellar objects of known spectral type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these ulxs are hosted in star - forming regions and their optical counterparts have properties consistent with those of early type o - b stars . some ulxs are also associated with extended optical emission nebulae @xcite .",
    "ngc 1313 x-2 is a prototypical ulx ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . with a luminosity @xmath9erg s@xmath5 in the 0.2 - 10.0 kev band ,",
    "it is a good candidate for harboring an imbh ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "such an option is corroborated by the presence of a very soft x - ray spectral component ( @xmath11 ev ) which points to a compact object of mass definitely larger than those of galactic black hole candidates .",
    "moreover , the object exhibits x - ray variability on a timescale of months .    on the basis of a 19 ks _",
    "chandra _ exposure and accurate astrometry of field objects , @xcite ( z04 hereafter ) derived the source position with an uncertainty of 0.7@xmath12 ( ra=03:18:22.34 , dec=66:36:03.7 ; @xmath13 confidence level ) .",
    "inside the _ chandra _ error box a faint optical candidate was found on a r band image taken with the eso 3.6 m telescope in january 2002 .    here",
    "we present a follow - up study of the optical counterpart of ngc 1313 x-2 , based on photometric archive data obtained with the eso vlt telescope and a reconsideration of our previous photometry of the eso 3.6 m+efosc image .",
    "we analyzed archive eso vlt+fors1 images ( @xmath14 ) and spectra of ngc 1313 x-2 taken between december 2003 and january 2004 ( program i d 072.d0614 ) .",
    "the observations are listed in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "data reduction was performed using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the images were astrometrically calibrated using 29 gsc2 stars .",
    "the calibration uncertainty , tested with gsc2 stars not used for the calibration , is @xmath15 .",
    "finally , for each band the images were combined and cleaned from cosmic rays .",
    "figure [ fig : bvr ] shows the combined @xmath0 and @xmath16 images . on the same night a short exposure of the standard pg 0231 + 051 landolt field @xcite was also taken in each band .",
    "aperture photometry ( 1@xmath17 radius ) was performed on the combined images .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were then calibrated with the landolt standard stars in the bessel - cousins system ( see * ? ? ? * for extinction coefficients and color terms ) .",
    "z04 give the _ r _ magnitude of a number of objects around ngc 1313 x-2 and of the proposed counterpart ( object c in their paper ) .",
    "the latter was close to the limit of detectability on their image and appeared as a single object .",
    "thanks to the higher resolution of the vlt image , in the @xmath0 and @xmath18 exposures we are able to resolve object c in two distinct point sources , c1 and c2 .",
    "both are inside the _ chandra _ error box ( see figure [ fig : bvr ] ) .",
    "object c2 is not detected in the @xmath16 band frame .",
    "magnitudes , colors and astrometric positions of the two candidate counterparts , c1 and c2 , and of objects a , b , and d ( following z04 ) are reported in table [ tab : mag ] .",
    "the photometric errors are the @xmath19 statistical errors on the measurements with the different landolt standards . for object c2 , we quote an upper limit to the @xmath16 band magnitude using the plate limit ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the total magnitude of object c1+c2 is @xmath21 .",
    "we note that this measurement is not in agreement with the estimated magnitude of object c obtained in our previous eso 3.6 m image ( @xmath22 ; see z04 ) .",
    "in fact , re - analyzing the old image we found that the stellar background used for subtraction was underestimated , leading to a measurement @xmath23 mag brigther",
    ". we also found a mistake in the adopted exposure time of the image that causes an overestimate of another @xmath7 0.9 mag .",
    "the revised magnitude of object c in the eso 3.6 m image is now found to be @xmath24 , in reasonable agreement ( within 2@xmath25 ) with the vlt measurement .",
    "in addition to the images , we also analyzed four vlt+fors1 spectra ( @xmath26=5900 a , @xmath27=440 at @xmath26 ) of objects c1+c2 taken in different nights ( table [ tab : obslog ] ) .",
    "the slit ( @xmath28 ) was oriented to include object d. after performing standard reduction , all spectra were sky subtracted , wavelenght calibrated through comparison lamp exposures and flux calibrated using standard star spectra obtained in the same night . in these vlt+fors1 spectra the two sources ( c1 and c2 ) are not spatially resolved . the 2d spectrum taken on 15 january 2004",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : neb ] .",
    "nebular emission lines of [ oii ] @xmath29 3727 a , h@xmath30 , h@xmath31 , [ oiii ] @xmath32 4959 - 5007 a , [ oi ] @xmath29 6300 and 6364 a , h@xmath33 , [ nii ] @xmath29 6583 a and [ sii ] @xmath32 6717 - 6731 a are clearly detected .",
    "note that this is the first detection of a [ oii ] line from this nebula .",
    "a one dimensional spectrum was extracted over an aperture of 2.2@xmath17 centered on object c1+c2 from each of the four combined spectra .",
    "two nebular spectra were extracted from different 1@xmath17 apertures , eastward and westward of the source position and adjacent to it .",
    "the two spectra were then averaged and the resulting spectrum subtracted from that of object c1+c2 .",
    "all these spectra , taken on january 15th , are shown in figure [ fig : spec1d ] .",
    "the nebula - subtracted source spectrum shows no evident emission or absorption lines .",
    "residuals are present in coincidence with some nebular lines ( expecially [ oiii ] and h@xmath33 ) , with an upper limit to the equivalent width of @xmath34 a. in particular the residual flux in the [ oiii ] line is a non negligible fraction of the nebular flux .",
    "this appears to be caused by an increased emission of the nebular line around the position of object c1+c2 .",
    "it is not clear if this is simply induced by a change in the rather irregular spatial profile of the nebular line or by a variation of the physical conditions produced by the presence of the nearby ulx .",
    "finally , marginal evidence of an excess in emission may be seen at 4686 a , corresponding to heii emission , but the line is not statistically significant .",
    "the superb quality of the vlt images reveals that two distinct objects , c1 and c2 , are visible inside the _ chandra _ error box of ngc 1313 x-2 in the _ r _ and _ v _ bands . from the astrometric positions reported in table [ tab : mag ] , we infer a separation of @xmath1 and a position angle ( c2 with respect to c1 ) of @xmath7131@xmath35 . note that the two objects were unresolved in our previous 3.6 m+efosc image .    the possibility that either c1 or c2 may be a background agn appears very unlikely . in fact ,",
    "no statistically significant emission line at wavelengths longer than h@xmath33 is observed in the optical spectrum nor any other feature that may be identified with a highly redshifted emission line .",
    "furthermore , from the _ r _ magnitude of objects c1 and c2 , and the x - ray flux of the last _ xmm - newton _ observation ( @xmath36 erg @xmath37 s@xmath5 ; z04 ) , we obtain a x - ray to optical flux ratio @xmath38 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger than the typical value for an agn ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the possibility that object c2 is a highly obscured agn is not very convincing either .",
    "in fact , to produce the same x - ray flux but a @xmath40 ratio of @xmath41 , the @xmath0 magnitude should be @xmath42 .",
    "therefore the additional reddening required to make object c2 look like an obscured agn is @xmath43 mag , corresponding to a column density @xmath44 @xmath37 @xcite , much larger than that inferred from x - ray spectral fits [ @xmath45 @xmath37 ] . unless absorption in ngc 1313 is characterized by an extinction law quite different with respect to that in our galaxy , we are led to rule out an identification with an ( obscured ) agn .",
    "a photometric analysis of a large sample of field stars ( @xmath47 ) was performed on the three @xmath14 images .",
    "a color - color plot of these objects is shown in figure [ fig : colcol ] .",
    "almost all of them have stellar colors , apart from two on the lower right part of the diagram that are bluer than ordinary stars . given their apparent magnitude ,",
    "objects earlier than spectral type f ( including c1 ) are stars in ngc 1313 , while the others may be galatic foreground stars or belong to ngc 1313 . however , object c2 can not be a galatic foreground star because its absolute visual magnitude would be @xmath48 , too large to be consistent with its colors .    within the photometric errors , the colors of object c1",
    "appear to be consistent with those of a a3-o9 i or a a2-b0 v star , while those of c2 with a g8-g7 i star ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the optical continuum does not provide useful information for assessing the spectral type because the light from both objects contributes to it .",
    "observationally , the slope of the continuum can be caracterized by a power law , @xmath49 .",
    "the absence or extreme weakness of the heii @xmath29 4686 a emission line in the optical spectrum suggests that x - ray irradiation is not dominant . taking galactic absoption into account and assuming @xmath50 ( @xcite exctinction law with @xmath51 has been used throughout ) , the unreddened colors of object c1 are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , consistent with those of a b8-o i or a0-o5 v star ( see figure [ fig : colcol ] ) .",
    "for object c2 it is @xmath54 and @xmath55 , consistent only with a g4 i star ( see again figure [ fig : colcol ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a 6.4 m magellan / baade observation of the field around ngc 1313 x-2 and found a @xmath56 mag object in coincidence with the position of c1+c2 ( that appear unresolved in their @xmath57 frame ) . assuming that the flux in the @xmath57 band originates mainly from the redder object c2 , we then obtain @xmath58 , consistent with our tentative spectral classification .    at the distance of ngc 1313 ( @xmath59 mpc ; @xcite ) the _ v _ magnitudes of c1 and c2 ( reported in table  [ tab : mag ] ) translate into the absolute magnitudes @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "comparing these values with the absolute magnitudes of main sequence and supergiant stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , we find that the observed value is consistent only with a b0 - 09 main sequence star for c1 , while it is consistent with a g4 supergiant of type ib for c2 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that both c1 and c2 are stars in ngc 1313 , with c1 an early type main sequence star and c2 a supergiant .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of the two objects are @xmath62 erg s@xmath5 and @xmath63 erg s@xmath5 , respectively .    given the density of objects in the field of view ( @xmath64 arcmin@xmath65 ) , a significant fraction of which are supergiants in ngc 1313 , the probability that c1 or c2 fall by chance inside the 2@xmath25 _ chandra _ error box is not negligible ( @xmath66 )",
    ". however , the chance occurrence of two objects , separated by only 0.7@xmath17 , inside the x - ray error box is @xmath67 , sufficiently small to be considered rather unlikely",
    ". actually , if both c1 and c2 are stars in ngc 1313 , a physical association may not be unplausible ( the distance corresponding to the apparent separation on the sky is @xmath68 pc ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ulx is most probably physically associated to either object c1 or c2 .",
    "irrespectively of which of the two objects is the actual counterpart , ngc 1313 x-2 appears to be a high mass x - ray binary with a very massive donor star .",
    "we now briefly consider what are the consequences if either c1 or c2 are the counterparts of the x - ray source .",
    "a b0-o9 main sequence star has an initial mass of @xmath2 . in this respect",
    "our analysis essentially confirms the original suggestion by z04 , who proposed that the optical counterpart of ngc 1313 x-2 may be an o type main sequence star in ngc 1313 .",
    "if the colors are affected by the binary interaction , the estimated mass may vary somewhat .",
    "a @xmath2 donor star could easily provide the mass transfer rate required to fuel the accreting black hole through roche - lobe overflow during the main sequence phase if the orbital separation is @xmath69 1 au . in these conditions , the mass transfer would be stable and the source persistent ( @xcite ; patruno & zampieri , in preparation ) .",
    "if object c2 is the counterpart , the nature of the system remains unchanged . in this case",
    "x - ray irradiation may be significant and give a non - negligible contribution to the optical emission .",
    "the mass corresponding to a g4 supergiant is @xmath3 .",
    "the same caveat discussed for c1 about the possibility that the colors and mass estimate are affected by binary interaction applies also in this case .",
    "the mass transfer rate provided by such a donor star throug roche - lobe overflow is certainly adequate also for large orbital separations .",
    "wind accretion may also be a viable alternative .    at the present stage",
    ", there seems to be no compelling argument to rule out any of the two objects c1 and c2 as possible counterparts of ngc 1313 x-2 . in both cases , ngc 1313 x-2 is a high - mass x - ray binary with a very massive donor . in order to distinguish which of the two objects is the counterpart ,",
    "further observations are needed .",
    "in particular , we aim at optical spectroscopy under optimal seeing conditions and with the slit along the line connecting c1 and c2 , which would allow us to check the existence of typical lines of x - ray binaries ( like he ii @xmath29 4686 a ) .",
    "theoretical modelling ( binary evolution calculations ) may also help distinguish the counterpart .",
    "it will also clarify the properties of the accretion flow and the compatibility with the imbh or stellar black hole interpretations .    based on observations made with eso telescopes at the paranal observatories , obtained from the eso / st - ecf science archive facility .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the italian ministry for education , university and research ( miur ) under grant prin-2004 - 023189 .",
    "we thank alessandro patruno for interesting discussions on the properties of imbh binary sistems .",
