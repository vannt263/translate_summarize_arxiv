    "hawking s vacuum conservation theorem @xcite states that in a spacetime which admits a time function and which satisfies the dominant energy condition , the stress - energy tensor vanishes on a compact domain delimited by two locally achronal hypersurfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 provided it vanishes on @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) . roughly speaking ,",

    "we wish to remove the assumption on the existence of a time function .",
    "this is desirable since the domain under consideration is often of the form @xmath2 , with @xmath0 partial cauchy hypersurface , where the horizon @xmath3 might form precisely due to the presence of closed timelike curves behind it , where a time function can not exist .",
    "hawking was aware of this limitation in his theorem and in fact on @xcite he sketched a possible more involved proof which however demanded a slightly stronger energy condition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* point ( 5 ) , p.  293 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the new argument hawking still assumes that a time function of the globally hyperbolic set @xmath4 extends up to the boundary @xmath5 remaining @xmath6 , which should not be expected in general due to the lack of regularity of @xmath5 .    in this work",
    "we shall retain carter s simplification and we shall reach the desired conclusion without invoking the existence of a time function . also , we shall not need to strengthen the energy condition .",

    "we assume that the metric satisfies the einstein equations with cosmological constant , and that the stress - energy tensor satisfies :    the _ dominant energy condition_. on every tangent space @xmath10 the linear endomorphism @xmath11 sends the future - directed non - spacelike cone into itself .",
    "when @xmath12 is timelike and normalized @xmath13 represents the energy - mumentum flow which the condition demands to be causal , roughly speaking energy can not travel faster than light .",
    "physically , the dominant energy condition is nothing more than that since the constraint for @xmath14 null follows by continuity from that for @xmath14 timelike .",
    "let us recall some basic consequences of the dominant energy condition .",

    "if the rank of @xmath18 is non - zero then we can find a @xmath19 with non - vanishing image , and altering its sign if necessary , we obtain an image vector which is not a future - directed non - spacelike vector .",
    "the contradiction proves that only null vectors can be sent to the zero vector .    since the scalar product of two future - directed causal vectors is non - positive and vanishes if and only if they are proportional and lightlike we see that , for any two future - directed causal vectors @xmath14 and @xmath20 @xmath21 equality holding only if at least one of the vectors is lightlike . in particular , the dominant energy condition ( dec ) implies the _ weak energy condition _ ( wec ) which demands that for every timelike vector @xmath14 ( and hence by continuity , for every null @xmath14 ) @xmath22 , and the wec implies the _ null energy condition _",
