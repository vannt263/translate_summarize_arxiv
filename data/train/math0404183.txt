    ". then @xmath66 $ ] is the ring of @xmath67-linear differential operators with constant coefficients .",
    "let us view example [ ex-210 ] in the light of our definition of general hypergeometric systems .",
    "in definition [ def : a - hyp ] there are infinitely many toric equations , one for each element @xmath25 of @xmath68 . on the other hand , in ( [ eqn:210 ] ) we listed only one such , @xmath69 with @xmath21 .",
    "yet it turns out that no information is lost .",
    "namely , if @xmath3 is the matrix of example [ ex-210 ] and @xmath70 then up to sign @xmath71 for some natural number @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that , again up to sign , @xmath73",
    "so if @xmath29 is annihilated by @xmath74 then it is also annihilated by @xmath75 for all other @xmath70 .",
    "more generally , it turns out that for any matrix @xmath3 one always only needs to look at a finite number of toric equations ; in order to explain the reasons for this we simplify our notation a bit as follows . in the remainder of the paper we would like to use multi - index notation : if @xmath76 we mean by @xmath77 the ( laurent ) monomial @xmath78 ; a similar convention shall be used for @xmath79 . also , if @xmath80 , we write @xmath81 , where : @xmath82 with this notation , the toric operator @xmath83 in @xmath61 corresponding to @xmath84 becomes @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 be the _",
    "toric ideal _ in @xmath87 generated by all @xmath88 with @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath87 is noetherian , there is a finite set of generators for this ideal .",
    "in fact , since @xmath86 is generated by _",
    "binomials _ , this finite generating set will consist of binomials and hence be of the form @xmath89 for some elements @xmath90 in @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , there are simple algorithms to find such a collection @xmath91 , see @xcite .",
    "although we will not use this , we would like to mention that by a theorem of stafford @xcite the entire @xmath3-hypergeometric system is equivalent to a linear system of just _ two _ differential equations .",
    "however , these two equations are very complicated since they have to carry a lot of information .",
    "since @xmath61 is a _ linear _ system of equations , the set of its holomorphic solutions on a simply connected open set in @xmath92 forms a vector space over the complex numbers .",
    "the dimension of this vector space we shall call the _ rank _ of @xmath61 and denote it by @xmath93 . somewhat surprisingly , the rank turns out to be finite for any choice of @xmath3 and @xmath58  this is a highly unusual event for systems partial differential equations .",
    "so one of the most basic questions one might ask about the @xmath3-hypergeometric system @xmath61 is :    * question a : * what is the rank of @xmath61 ?",
    "a first answer to this question was given by gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky @xcite who found that under a certain condition on the ideal @xmath86 called _ cohen  macaulayness _ , @xmath93 is actually _ independent _ of @xmath58 . to describe this condition ,",
    "consider the polynomial ring @xmath94 $ ] from above and its quotient @xmath95 .",
    "then one calls @xmath86 _ cohen  macaulay _ if and only if there are @xmath96 linear forms @xmath97 in @xmath87 such that for all @xmath59 the form @xmath98 is a non - zerodivisor on @xmath99 .",
    "this property is a way of allowing singularities to occur in @xmath100 while preserving many good algebraic properties . by a theorem of hochster @xcite , one particular class of cohen ",
    "macaulay examples is provided by those matrices @xmath3 for which the collection @xmath101 of all @xmath9-linear combinations of the columns of @xmath3 is _",
    "saturated_. this condition means that if a lattice point @xmath102 has some multiple @xmath103 in @xmath101 , then @xmath104 itself is already in @xmath101 .",
    "such saturated semigroups arise naturally as the collection of all lattice points inside the _ positive cone _",
    "@xmath105 of @xmath72 lattice points @xmath106 .",
    "our example [ ex-210 ] is of this type with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    under the assumption of cohen  macaulayness , a completely explicit combinatorial formula for the rank was provided in @xcite .",
    "let us describe this formula .",
    "form a polytope @xmath109 by taking the convex hull of the columns of @xmath3 and the origin , pictured as points in @xmath110 . since @xmath3 has full rank this polytope has dimension @xmath57 . then the _ simplicial _ or _ normalized volume _ of @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath111 equals the product of @xmath112 and the usual euclidean volume of @xmath109 ( so that , for example , a standard @xmath57-simplex has simplicial volume equal to @xmath113 ) . with this notation ,",
    "if @xmath86 is cohen  macaulay , then the rank @xmath93 of the hypergeometric system to @xmath3 and @xmath58 agrees with the simplicial volume @xmath111 no matter what the parameter @xmath114 is .",
    "several authors have expanded on these results , usually in the _ homogeneous _ case where all the columns of @xmath3 , considered as points in @xmath110 , lie in a hyperplane not containing the origin .",
    "for example , adolphson @xcite showed that even if @xmath3 fails to be cohen ",
    "macaulay then the formula @xmath115 is valid for _ almost every _ @xmath58 . if @xmath3 is homogeneous , but under no other conditions on either @xmath3 or @xmath58 , we always have @xmath116 as was shown by saito , sturmfels and takayama @xcite",
    "considering these results , the natural question is :    * question b : * are there actually any examples where @xmath117 ?    the answer is `` yes '' , and the first and smallest example of this type was given in @xcite ; we will revisit it in example [ example:0134 ] .",
    "experimental studies showed that constructing rank - jumping examples @xmath118 is very hard since they are quite rare ; this accounts for the 10-year delay between the first results on @xmath3-hypergeometric functions and the discovery of the first rank - jump .",
    "one reason that makes rank - jumps very interesting is that they seem to coincide with the existence of very nice solutions : contrary to typical solutions which are proper power series , in all cases that are known to the authors the `` extra '' solutions at a rank - jump are _ laurent polynomials _ ( or puiseux polynomials , if the exponents are non - integral ) ; this fact is not well understood yet .",
    "viewing the results of @xcite in the light of example [ example:0134 ] , one is then lead to three more precise questions :    * questions c : *    1 .",
    "which matrices @xmath3 allow for rank jumps ? 2 .",
    "if @xmath3 has a rank jump at all , which parameters are rank - jumping ? 3",
    "if @xmath58 is a rank - jumping parameter for @xmath3 , by how much does the rank exceed the volume ?",
    "the first two questions have been recently answered in full @xcite . in the present article",
    "we are interested in the third question and investigate the possible magnitude of the gap between rank and volume .",
    "there is a known upper bound for the rank in terms of the volume given by @xmath119 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.1.2 ) .",
    "it is believed that this exponential upper bound is not optimal .",
    "in fact , until now no example had been known in which the rank exceeds the volume by three or more .    the goal of this article to describe a family of examples that exhibit arbitrarily large rank jumps , we shall prove :    [ theorem : main ] for any @xmath120 there exists a @xmath121-matrix @xmath122 and a parameter @xmath123 such that @xmath124    in contrast to the substantial amount of algebra and analysis that is needed to prove most of the results quoted above , the proof of our result is completely elementary , requires only a knowledge of linear algebra and is based on constructing laurent polynomial solutions .",
    "we now present a major player in our later constructions : the first ever rank - jumping example .",
    "[ example:0134 ] let @xmath27 and @xmath125 then @xmath126 is generated by @xmath127 and there are two homogeneity conditions : @xmath128 in this case , @xmath129    example [ example:0134 ] was completely analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we refer to that article for a proof that @xmath130 is indeed the unique parameter for which rank exceeds volume .",
    "we now present an explicit basis for the solution space of @xmath131 .",
    "[ thm : basis ] let @xmath132 and put for @xmath133 @xmath134 consider for @xmath133 the functions @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 denotes the usual gamma function .",
    "if one sets @xmath138 then the five functions @xmath139 are a basis for the solution space of @xmath131 .",
    "we are now ready to provide , for given @xmath0 , a @xmath140 matrix @xmath122 and a parameter @xmath141 such that @xmath142 as we mentioned before , previously no example existed where the gap between rank and volume exceeds two .",
    "if @xmath143 , example [ example:0134 ] will do .",
    "so for the remainder of this article we fix an integer @xmath144 , and we write @xmath3 and @xmath58 instead of @xmath122 and @xmath2 in order to simplify notation .",
    "we will prove this theorem in a series of lemmas .",
    "first we will compute the simplicial volume @xmath111 ; after this is done , we will exhibit the required number of linearly independent solutions of @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath155 , the convex hull of the columns of @xmath3 . since the columns of @xmath3 all lie in the hyperplane @xmath156 of @xmath110 , the convex hull @xmath109 of the origin and the columns of @xmath3 form a pyramid of height one over @xmath157 .",
    "hence the simplicial volume of @xmath109 is equal to the simplicial volume of @xmath157 ; we compute the latter .",
    "the polytope @xmath157 is the union of two others : the prism @xmath158 ( over the standard @xmath159-simplex with vertices @xmath160 ) whose vertices are the columns of : @xmath161 and the @xmath162-simplex @xmath163 whose vertices @xmath164 are the columns of : @xmath165 in figure [ fig : decomp ] we see the decomposition of @xmath157 into the prism @xmath158 and the simplex @xmath163 for @xmath166 .",
    "since the prism has height one , its euclidean volume equals the euclidean volume of its base , the standard @xmath159-simplex with euclidean volume @xmath167 .",
    "thus , @xmath158 has simplicial volume @xmath168 .",
    "the next step in our proof is to construct @xmath171 solutions of @xmath61 . in order to do this",
    "we need to understand the integer kernel of @xmath3 , because the toric equations are constructed directly from these elements . in particular",
    ", we will identify positive and negative coordinates of certain elements in @xmath172 .",
    "the other important ingredient is finding integer solutions of @xmath173 .",
    "the fact that the coordinates of @xmath58 are small positive integers will facilitate this search .",
    "however , we start with showing that any solution of @xmath131 is a solution of our system .    [ lemma : prevsols ]",
    "let @xmath174 be a solution of @xmath131 .",
    "then @xmath174 is a solution of @xmath61 . in particular , the functions @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 from theorem [ thm : basis ] are linearly independent solutions of @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath174 is a solution of the homogeneity equations @xmath180 hence we only need to verify that @xmath174 is annihilated by the toric operators @xmath181 for all @xmath182 .",
    "we now study the integer kernel @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath3 is of full rank @xmath57 and the columns of the following @xmath183-matrix @xmath184 are linearly independent , the columns of @xmath184 form a basis for the kernel of @xmath184 over the rational numbers : @xmath185 using rows @xmath186 we see that the greatest common divisor of the maximal minors of @xmath184 is @xmath113 .",
    "this implies that the columns of @xmath184 are actually a basis for the integer kernel @xmath68 : any element of @xmath172 is an _ integer _",
    "linear combination of the columns of @xmath184 .",
    "choose a toric operator @xmath187 where @xmath188 for some @xmath189 .",
    "if @xmath190 for some @xmath191 , then @xmath192 and @xmath193 will be nonzero , with opposite signs .",
    "this means that one of the monomials in @xmath187 will contain @xmath194 , and the other will contain @xmath195 .",
    "since @xmath174 does not contain the variables @xmath196 nor @xmath197 , it follows that both monomials annihilate @xmath174 and therefore @xmath198 .",
    "it remains to consider the case when only @xmath199 and @xmath200 are allowed to be nonzero .",
    "but in that case @xmath201 gives a toric operator inside @xmath131 , and @xmath174 was assumed to be a solution of that system .",
    "we note that there are no polynomial solutions for @xmath61 since any such solution would have to have multi - degree @xmath58 and @xmath58 is not an @xmath9-linear combination of the multi - degrees of the @xmath42 , which are the columns of @xmath3 .",
    "we will now construct laurent polynomial solutions for @xmath61 , one for each vertex of the polyhedron @xmath155 .",
    "these vertices are the columns @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 of the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the correspondence between the laurent polynomials @xmath205 and the vertices @xmath206 will be given by      for the vertices @xmath202 and @xmath203 we already have such solutions , namely the laurent monomials @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "so we need to construct laurent polynomial solutions @xmath205 of @xmath61 associated to @xmath209 , and since @xmath61 does not have polynomial solutions , these are proper fractions .",
    "if @xmath210 is a laurent polynomial solution of @xmath61 then the homogeneity equations imply that @xmath211 for any @xmath36 such that @xmath212 .",
    "hence the possible laurent monomials appearing in a laurent solution @xmath205 of @xmath61 associated to @xmath206 are of the form @xmath213 where @xmath211 , @xmath214 and only @xmath215 is a negative integer .",
    "let us search for all such vectors @xmath36 when @xmath216 .",
    "since the second coordinate of @xmath58 is zero and only the columns @xmath217 and @xmath218 of @xmath3 have nonzero second coordinates , we must have @xmath219 .",
    "then @xmath220 note that @xmath3 has no negative entries .",
    "as @xmath221 for @xmath222 , @xmath223 is in each component bounded from below by @xmath224 , so @xmath225 equals @xmath113 or @xmath226 .",
    "moreover , every @xmath206 has a @xmath113 in the first coordinate and so @xmath36 has precisely one more nonzero entry besides @xmath227 and @xmath225 ; this entry will be a @xmath113 .",
    "now if @xmath228 for any @xmath229 then @xmath230 will have a @xmath113 in a place where @xmath58 has a zero .",
    "therefore , the third nonzero coordinate of @xmath36 must be one of @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 or @xmath234 .",
    "if @xmath235 , we get @xmath236 while for @xmath237 we get @xmath238 ; there is no other choice .",
    "this gives us two possible monomials to make a laurent polynomial solution of @xmath61 where only @xmath239 is in the denominator , namely the monomials @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "neither of these laurent monomials is a solution for @xmath61 , but a suitable linear combination is :      by our construction , @xmath243 is a solution of the homogeneity equations , @xmath244 because the exponents appearing in it satisfy @xmath211 .",
    "now we need to see that @xmath243 is a solution to @xmath245 whenever @xmath246 .",
    "recall that @xmath172 has a @xmath247-basis consisting of the columns of the matrix @xmath184 .",
    "let us look at a toric equation @xmath248 , where @xmath249 for some integer vector @xmath250 .",
    "if @xmath190 for some @xmath251 , then @xmath192 and @xmath193 are nonzero with opposite signs .",
    "then @xmath194 and @xmath195 appear in different monomials in @xmath187 while @xmath243 does not contain either of the variables @xmath196 or @xmath197 .",
    "this means that @xmath252 so let us now look at @xmath253 for @xmath53 such that @xmath254 , @xmath255 .",
    "then the only ( possibly ) nonzero coordinates of @xmath25 are the following : @xmath256 with all @xmath257 .",
    "if @xmath258 and @xmath259 are both nonzero and have different signs , then the fact that @xmath243 contains neither @xmath260 nor @xmath261 implies that @xmath262 .",
    "this means that we need to study three cases :      in case ( 1 ) , we have @xmath266 . if @xmath267 , then we have @xmath268 and @xmath269 in different monomials of @xmath187 , which implies that @xmath270 . in the remaining case @xmath271 one",
    "finds @xmath272    in case ( 2 ) one sees immediately that @xmath273 kills @xmath243 since @xmath258 or @xmath259 will be positive and @xmath243 does not involve either variable .",
    "so we need to show that @xmath274 also kills @xmath243 . from the given inequalities",
    "one deduces that either @xmath275 or that @xmath276 and @xmath277 . in the latter situation @xmath278 , so @xmath274 contains @xmath279 and hence kills @xmath243 .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath275 .",
    "clearly if @xmath280 then @xmath274 contains @xmath281 and hence kills @xmath243 . if @xmath282 then @xmath283 kills @xmath243 . finally , if @xmath284 then @xmath274 contains @xmath279 and kills @xmath243 .",
    "the construction of @xmath285 goes along the same lines as the construction of @xmath243 .",
    "first we find that the only solutions of @xmath286 with @xmath287 for @xmath288 and @xmath289 are the vectors @xmath290 then we propose @xmath291 a similar analysis as in lemma [ lemma : p5 ] shows that , except for @xmath292 , every generator @xmath187 of @xmath86 has the property that both @xmath293 and @xmath294 annihilate @xmath285 . now to establish @xmath285 as solution of @xmath61 reduces to checking that @xmath295          the functions @xmath298 and @xmath299 are @xmath171 solutions of @xmath61 . by theorem [ thm : basis ] , the first five are linearly independent .",
    "since for @xmath300 the laurent solution @xmath205 has a pole in @xmath42 and since @xmath42 does not occur in the solutions @xmath301 we conclude that all these solutions are linearly independent .",

    "<S> we construct a matrix @xmath1 and a parameter vector @xmath2 such that the holonomic rank of the @xmath3-hypergeometric system @xmath4 exceeds the simplicial volume @xmath5 by at least @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the largest previously known gap between rank and volume was two .    </S>",
    "<S> our argument is elementary in that it uses only linear algebra , and our construction gives evidence to the general observation that rank - jumps seem to go hand in hand with the existence of multiple laurent ( or puiseux ) polynomial solutions . </S>"
