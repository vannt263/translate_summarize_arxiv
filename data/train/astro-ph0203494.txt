    "infrared galaxies ( rieke & low 1972 ) , and in particular nearby luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , with @xmath9l@xmath10 and @xmath11l@xmath12 respectively ) have long been recognized as one of the best laboratories to study the process of violent star formation in the local universe .",
    "the dust - rich environments of lirgs and ulirgs are thought to be similar to the conditions in which star formation occurred at high redshift ( ivison et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "it is clear now from both the theoretical and the observational viewpoints that interactions play a major role in enhancing star formation throughout galaxies .",
    "in fact , the fraction of interactions / mergers increases from @xmath13 for @xmath14l@xmath10 up to @xmath15 for @xmath11l@xmath10 .",
    "the process of merging with accompanying super - starbursts appears to be an important stage in galactic evolution , possibly even converting spiral galaxies into ellipticals ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) .",
    "moreover , it has been recently suggested that most interacting / merging systems have gone or will go through an ultraluminous phase , depending on how efficiently molecular gas can be funneled into the nuclear regions .",
    "this may imply that most of ulirg class systems may spend a large portion of their lifetime in the less powerful class of lirgs ( murphy et al .",

    "_ observations , we have started to get the first glimpses into the detailed nature ( that is , on scales of a few tens of parsecs ) of the extreme star formation processes in lirgs and interacting galaxies .",
    "the discovery , both in the optical and the near - infrared , of a large population of massive ( young ) star clusters , the so - called super star clusters ( sscs ) , has shown that a significant fraction of the massive star formation is occurring there ( see among others , whitmore et al . 1993 ; schweizer et al .",

    "hst_/nicmos imaging has only recently revealed a population of bright hii regions in two lirgs , arp  299 and ngc  1614 ( aah00 ; aah01 ) .",
    "a large fraction of these hii regions show luminosities in excess of that of 30 doradus , the prototypical giant hii region .",
    "one of the main difficulties in quantifying the age of the stellar populations in lirgs and interacting galaxies is breaking the age - extinction degeneracy .",
    "this usually translates into only rough age estimates for sscs ( from photometric data ) ranging between 5 and 900myr ( see the recent review by whitmore 2000 ) .",
    "hii regions , on the other hand , will highlight the youngest regions of star formation , with ages of @xmath18myr , as these are the lifetimes of the o and b stars required to ionize the gas . clearly , understanding the properties of hii regions and sscs , and their relation at high spatial resolution will provide further insight into the nature of the star formation processes in lirgs .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the _ detailed _ ( tens to a few hundred parsecs ) properties of the star forming regions ( hii regions and star clusters ) of a sample of 8 lirgs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ( 2 ) describes the observations , data reduction and the production of the hii region and star cluster catalogs . in section",
    "( 3 ) we establish the overall morphology of star forming regions in lirgs and its relation with the dynamical stage of the galaxy . in section  ( 4 )",
    "the statistical properties of hii regions in lirgs are analyzed and compared with those of normal galaxies observed at comparable spatial resolutions .",
    "the spatial distribution of hii regions and star clusters , their relative numbers and the age sequence are analyzed in section  ( 5 ) .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  ( 6 ) .",
    "the large amount of extinction routinely present in lirgs , and in particular , the fact that active star forming regions are expected to contain non - negligible amounts of dust , prompted us to search the _ hst _ archive for infrared observations .",
    "the obvious choice was narrow - band pa@xmath1 and broad - band continuum imaging to identify hii regions and star clusters respectively .",
    "this resulted in a sample of eight lirgs .",
    "the sample covers a range of infrared luminosities  between @xmath19 and @xmath20  as well as a variety of dynamical stages : isolated galaxies , close pairs of interacting galaxies and advanced mergers .",
    "the sample is presented in table  1 ) is close enough to the limit that it is included in our sample ] in increasing order of infrared luminosity .",
    "the observations of the lirgs analyzed in this paper were obtained as part of a variety of _",
    "hst_/nicmos gto and go programs , listed in table  1 .",
    "the pa@xmath1+continuum images were taken with the nic2 and nic3 cameras ( pixel size 0.076pixel@xmath16 and 0.2pixel@xmath16 , respectively ) using the narrow - band filter f190n filter . at the distances of the lirg sample , this filter ( @xmath21 )",
    "contains the pa@xmath1 emission line and the adjacent continuum at @xmath22 m . for the continuum subtraction , images through the f187n filter were used , except for ngc  5653 and ngc  6808 ( from bker et al .",
    "1999 survey ) for which broad - band f160w filter observations were employed instead .",
    "the field of view of the images is @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the nic2 and nic3 observations , respectively .",
    "all the continuum images used to identify the star clusters were observed through the f160w filter which represents a good compromise between the better spatial resolution at shorter wavelengths and lower extinction at longer wavelengths .    in table  1 for each galaxy we list the infrared luminosity , distance ( assuming @xmath25 ) , large scale morphology , cameras and filters used , the corresponding linear scale in parsec per pixel and the _ hst _ program number of the observations .",
    "the images were reduced using nicred ( mcleod et al . 1997 ) routines , which involve subtraction of the first readout , dark current subtraction on a readout - by - readout basis , correction for linearity and cosmic ray rejection ( using fullfit ) , and flat fielding . for the data reduced we used on - orbit dark and flatfield images .",
    "the angular resolution ( fwhm ) of the nic2 and nic3 images is approximately 0.14and 0.30 , respectively , as measured from the point spread function ( psf ) of stars in the images .",
    "the flux calibration of the f160w , f187n and f190n images was performed using conversion factors based upon measurements of the standard star p330-e , taken during the servicing mission observatory verification ( smov ) program ( m. j. rieke , private communication 1999 ) .",
    "the observed wavelength of pa@xmath1 for the two most distant galaxies in our sample , vv  114 and ngc  6240 , is @xmath26 m and @xmath27 m respectively .",
    "figure  1 shows the observed pa@xmath1 emission lines as gaussian functions with line widths of @xmath28 m for ngc  6240 ( goldader et al .",

    "we also display the same emission lines as if they had been observed at the center of the f190n filter .",
    "as can be seen from this figure for both galaxies , the observed pa@xmath1 emission lines are significantly displaced from the center of the narrow - band f190n filter .",
    "assuming gaussian line profiles , we estimate that the nicmos filter may intercept only @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the full pa@xmath1 line flux for these galaxies , respectively .",
    "given the large and uncertain correction implied to the true line flux , our results for these two galaxies are only qualitative .    throughout the paper",
    "we have converted the pa@xmath1 luminosity into the more commonly used h@xmath1 luminosity , assuming case b recombination ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "the lower limit for the size of an hii region is set to 9 contiguous pixels , which for the distances of the galaxies in our sample corresponds to _ minimum _ linear sizes ( diameters ) of between 42 and 234pc .",
    "each pixel must have an intensity above the local background of at least three times the rms noise of that local background ( see rand 1992 for more details on the criteria employed ) .",

    "in section  5 we will compare the number of detected hii regions with the number of star clusters .",

    "the positions of the star clusters were identified from the @xmath0 m continuum images using the daofind task in iraf .",
    "as discussed in aah00 for arp  299 , we find that the star clusters in most of the systems studied here are located on a local background with a substantial gradient , and a large degree of crowding .",
    "thus an automated method to perform photometry as that provided by daofind may yield to systematic errors , especially for the faintest star clusters . for this reason we have performed aperture photometry on the clusters of the three galaxies with the best spatial resolution ( ngc  3256 and the two components of arp  299 ) for which the results will be discussed in section  5 .",
    "the photometry was obtained through a relatively small aperture ( @xmath34 ) , so an aperture correction was applied to account for the total flux .",
    "the absolute @xmath33-band magnitudes of the star clusters in these two systems range up to @xmath35mag .",
    "the detection lower limit depends on the underlying galaxy background and the degree of crowding .",
    "we find that the luminosity distribution of the star clusters is complete down to @xmath36mag and @xmath37mag for ngc  3256 and arp  299 , respectively .",

    "the pa@xmath1 line emission of interacting / merging systems shows a more complex morphology , differing significantly from the stellar light distribution ( continuum images ) .",
    "a common denominator for all these systems is the bright emission from the nuclei of the galaxies .",

    "merging systems , besides the bright nuclear pa@xmath1 emission , the recent star formation is also widely spread throughout the galaxies . in ngc  3256 and ngc  1614",

    "in the interacting systems arp  299 and vv  114 , hii regions are detected throughout the galaxies , and at the interface region .",
    "this is in good agreement with findings for ulirgs in murphy et al .",
    "the pa@xmath1 morphology in the merging / interacting systems clearly shows that the effects of extreme star formation can propagate throughout the galaxies and not only in the nuclei .",
    "recently bekki & couch ( 2001 ) have run stellar and gas numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to find the most promising sites for formation of sscs .",
    "they conclude that these sscs are not only formed in the central regions , but also between the two interacting galaxies .",

    "this is consistent with recent _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 h@xmath1 imaging ( gerssen et al .",
    "the larger scale filamentary diffuse morphology in ngc  6240 has not been detected by the nicmos observations , probably as a result of the pa@xmath1 line falling at the edge of the narrow - band filter ( see section  2.2 ) .    as most of the infrared luminosity in lirgs is believed to be due to dust heated in regions of strong star formation , the mid - infrared emission in lirgs",
    "would be expected to trace the pa@xmath1 emission .",
    "recently soifer et al . (",

    "2001 ) . in the isolated systems",
    "most of the star formation is occurring in the disks of the galaxies , whereas in the interacting / merging systems the location of the star forming regions depends on factors such as the age of the interaction process and the physical properties of the interacting galaxies ( among others , the initial gas content and mass ratios of the interacting galaxies , see e.g. , bekki & couch 2001 ) .",
    "table  2 also gives the ratios between the infrared luminosity and the total h@xmath1 luminosity for the lirgs in our sample .",
    "these ratios are found to be similar for all the galaxies except for zw  049.057 where the pa@xmath1 emission is probably affected by high extinction , and ngc  6240 for which the pa@xmath1 luminosities are uncertain as discussed in section  2.2 .",
    "we have measured the luminosity and diameter of the identified hii regions in our sample of lirgs . for each galaxy",
    "we determined the h@xmath1 luminosity for the brightest hii region , for the three brightest hii regions ( first - ranked hii regions ) and the median hii region , as well as the diameter for the largest hii region ( which is not necessarily the brightest hii region ) , for the first - ranked hii regions and the median hii regions .",
    "the results are summarized in the first part of table  3 , where galaxies are sorted in order of decreasing spatial resolution . as discussed in alonso - herrero & knapen ( 2001 ) and others , even at _ hst _ spatial resolutions the problem of defining an hii region remains .",
    "for instance , at increasing higher spatial resolutions different emission peaks within an hii region may be identified as individual hii regions thus cataloging them as smaller and less luminous hii regions .",
    "conversely , as the spatial resolution becomes poorer , blending effects will become more frequent .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in the increasing median sizes of hii regions in the lirg sample for decreasing spatial resolutions ( table  3 ) .",
    "all the lirgs in our sample contain a significant number of exceptionally bright hii regions ( i.e. , the median values of the hii region luminosity distribution ) with h@xmath1 luminosities comparable to that of the giant hii region 30 doradus ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the first - ranked hii regions in the interacting / merging galaxies  usually coincident with the nuclei of the galaxies  are between one and two orders of magnitude brighter than the median hii regions .",
    "as can be seen from table  3 the luminosities of the brightest and first - ranked hii of the two isolated galaxies , even at poorer spatial resolutions , are markedly less luminous than their counterparts in interacting / merging systems . unfortunately the small number of lirgs in our sample does not allow us to establish whether isolated lirgs tend to have fainter hii regions than interacting lirgs .",
    "the statistical properties of hii regions are represented with lfs , usually fitted by a power law :    @xmath55    where @xmath1 is the index of the power law with values of @xmath56 for extragalactic hii regions ( kennicutt , edgar , & hodge 1989 ) .",
    "we have constructed hii region lfs for the two lirgs in our sample with a sufficiently high number of detected hii regions : arp  299 and ngc  3256 ( shown in figure  3 ) .",
    "we have fitted the slopes of the lfs excluding the nuclei and the regions of strong star formation activity in arp  299 ( as they may be blends of a few regions ) and found values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for ngc  3256 and arp  299 , respectively .",
    "if we include all hii regions in the fit , the values of the slopes are @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "these slopes are within the values fitted for hii regions in the disks and circumnuclear regions of normal galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt et al .",
    "1989 ) , and those found from fitting the luminosity functions of star clusters ( e.g. , zepf et al .",
    "1999 ; whitmore 2000 ) .",
    "a number of studies have analyzed the statistical properties of hii regions ( luminosities , sizes , density numbers ) in the disks of normal spiral galaxies in terms of the morphological type of the galaxy and the arm - interarm regions ( see for instance the classical study of kennicutt et al . 1989 ) . because of the effect of the spatial resolution on the properties of hii regions , we chose to compare the statistical properties of the hii regions in lirgs with those of the circumnuclear hii regions of normal galaxies ( as derived from _",
    "pa@xmath1 observations ) studied by alonso - herrero & knapen ( 2001 ) . from this work ,",

    "we summarize the statistical properties of hii regions of the normal galaxies with the highest degree of central star forming activity ( as measured from the central kpc h@xmath1 luminosity ) : ngc  4192 , ngc  4389 , ic  750 , and ngc  4102 .",

    "we also indicate the h@xmath1 luminosity of 30 doradus , the prototypical giant hii region .",
    "these histograms not only show that giant hii regions are more common in lirgs than in normal galaxies  even when comparing with the interacting system ic  750  but also that the median hii regions in lirgs are at least an order of magnitude brighter than in normal galaxies .",
    "the large population of giant hii regions in lirgs  with a significant fraction being more luminous than 30 doradus  is unprecedented in normal galaxies .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations .",
    "we may just be seeing the extended tail of the hii region lf which translates into a larger number of the more massive ionizing star clusters , a extremely young population of star forming regions in lirgs , or perhaps the bright hii regions in lirgs may represent aggregations of normal hii regions .",
    "the typical ( median ) diameters for hii regions in normal galaxies and lirgs observed at the same spatial resolution are comparable ( see table  3 ) .",
    "this seems to argue against the last possibility .",
    "even though the first ranked hii regions in lirgs are typically a factor of two larger than in normal galaxies , the luminosities of the first - ranked ( as well as median ) hii regions in lirgs would require aggregations of ten `` normal '' hii regions .",
    "other possibilities are then evolutionary effects and the upper limit to the mass of the ionizing clusters .    as can be seen from the simulations of hii region lfs by oey & clark ( 1998 ) the age of the stellar population is one of the factors determining the high luminosity end of the hii region lf . for a population of hii regions formed in a single burst ,",
    "the high luminosity end of the lf as well as the slope vary as the population ages . in the case of continuous creation of hii regions",
    "the high luminosity end of the lf remains approximately constant .",
    "the youth of a population of coeval hii regions could be a possibility to explain the excess of bright hii regions in lirgs . as we shall see in the next section however ,",
    "the hii regions in lirgs show a range of ages , which means that the extreme luminosities of the hii regions in lirgs are not due to the fact that they are all very young .",
    "since the fitted slopes of the hii region lfs of two lirgs are consistent with the values found in normal galaxies , the extraordinary luminosities of hii regions in lirgs are simply reflecting a larger number of massive star clusters in lirgs , rather than an anomalous stellar mass distribution .",
    "as discussed in bekki & couch ( 2001 ) , the physical conditions ( high gas pressure and density of the interstellar medium ) necessary for the formation of super star clusters can only be achieved in systems undergoing a rapid transfer of gas to the central regions , that is , interacting galaxies .",
    "it is unlikely that these conditions are met in isolated disk galaxies .",
    "figure  2 shows that the emission peaks of the hii regions are generally not spatially coincident with the location of the near - infrared star clusters . to quantify this ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the positions of the hii regions and the near - infrared clusters .",
    "we counted a coincidence when the spatial separation between an hii region and a cluster was equal or less than 0.150.11  ( for the nic2 images ) and 0.400.30(for the nic3 images ) , that is , a separation of 2 and 1.5 pixels respectively .",
    "the results from the cross - correlation are presented in the first part of table  4 where we list the number of detected hii regions , and star clusters , together with the number of coincidences . as was clear from figure  2 , the number of coincidences is relatively small .",
    "the increasing number of coincidences ( intermediate age hii regions / clusters ) for ngc  5653 , ngc  6808 and vv  114 may be the result of the poorer spatial resolutions of the nic3 images , which implies that a coincidence is counted when the spatial separations are @xmath62pc ( @xmath63pc for the 2 pixel separation ) .",
    "for comparison , the spatial separations for the galaxies observed with the nic2 camera are @xmath64pc ( or @xmath65pc if we use the 2 pixel separation ) .",
    "this lack of spatial coincidence between hii regions and clusters has also been found in barred and ringed galaxies with strong star formation activity ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2001b ; maoz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "theoretical arguments may offer an explanation for the apparent offsets between the location of the sscs and the hii regions in lirgs .",
    "for instance , tan & mckee ( 2000 ) have proposed a model in which young clusters within clouds with masses @xmath66 can survive for up to 3myr and allow for the formation of gravitationally bound clusters ( which in turn may evolve into globular clusters ) in the presence of vigorous feedback ( wolf rayet winds and supernovae ) . according to their model , after approximately 3myr",
    ", the gas will be disrupted and the star cluster will emerge from its cocoon , and will be visible .",
    "the youngest sscs are still embedded in the ( probably dusty ) hii regions , and demonstrates that giant hii regions offer us an unprecedented view to the truly youngest ( high - mass ) star formation activity .",
    "the sscs on the other hand show a broader range of ages as we shall show in the next section .",
    "there are also galactic examples of this situation in obscured giant hii regions , where a variety of complex morphologies including nebular emission , regions of high and variable extinction and centrally concentrated star clusters are seen ( see blum et al .",
    "2001 for a census , and references therein ) .",
    "in particular these authors have established an evolutionary sequence for their sample of giant hii regions ( see their figure  1 ) , based on the morphology and spectroscopic ages of the stars . in the youngest hii regions the cluster stars are still veiled by the hot dust from their birth cocoons ; as the hii region ages , the clusters become more revealed as the gas will be dispersed by energetic winds and radiation pressure from the hot stars , until finally most of the gas will have dispersed .",
    "the lack of spatial correspondence between the near - infrared sscs and the bright hii regions in lirgs is suggestive of a similar evolutionary sequence as that seen in obscured galactic giant hii regions .",
    "to first order , ignoring possible effects of extinction and the observational detection limits , those hii regions with no near - infrared cluster counterpart will tend to be the youngest examples of star forming regions in which the gas is being ionized by the most massive stars , while the star clusters will still be embedded ; we denote them as `` young hii regions / clusters ''",
    ". they account for between 20% and 40% of all the detected sources ( star clusters and hii regions ) in lirgs ( see table  4 ) .",
    "the coincidences correspond to the case of an evolved hii region in which the near - infrared cluster is becoming `` visible '' , that is , the time period in which the cluster has begun to emerge from the natal dust . at the same time the first red supergiants will start appearing so the cluster will become bright in the near - infrared .",
    "the `` intermediate hii regions / clusters '' account for up to @xmath67 of the cluster + hii region population in lirgs .",
    "we also find that the number of coincidences tends to increase for the more luminous hii regions .",
    "for instance , in ngc  3256 we find that @xmath68 of the high luminosity hii regions have a new - infrared cluster counterpart ( see next section ) . and",
    "finally , the near - infrared star clusters with no hii region counterpart represent the case where the most massive ( ionizing ) stars have disappeared so there will be no detectable gas emission ; these will be referred to as `` old clusters '' .",
    "we estimate that they contribute between 56% and 72% of the detected cluster population of lirgs .",
    "the age / coincidence argument can be developed further by using outputs of evolutionary synthesis models and the relative numbers of hii regions , coincidences and near - infrared star clusters .",
    "obviously for a given galaxy , the number of identified sources depends on the detection threshold of the current observations .",
    "it will be easier to present this argument using the three galaxies with the best spatial resolutions : ngc  3256 , ic  694 and ngc  3690 .",
    "the argument however will be valid for any galaxy by changing the detection limits .",
    "in section  2.3 we established that the @xmath33-band luminosity functions of the star clusters in ngc  3256 and arp  299 are complete down to absolute magnitudes of @xmath69mag and @xmath37mag , respectively .",
    "the hii region luminosity functions are approximately complete down to @xmath70 ( previous section ) , which is equivalent to a number of ionizing photons of @xmath71 .",
    "we can use these detection limits to compute the fractions of young , intermediate and old populations for the complete distributions of ngc  3256 , ic  694 and ngc  3690 ( second part of table  4 ) . using the complete distributions increases the hii region fraction by @xmath72 , whereas the old cluster fraction drops by @xmath72 , and the coincidence fraction remains approximately constant .",
    "we will make use of evolutionary synthesis models to establish an age sequence , as well as to reproduce the fractions of young , intermediate and old clusters in these systems .",
    "our choice for the evolutionary synthesis models will be starburst99 ( leitherer et al . 1999 ) and those of rieke et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    in figure  5",
    "we show outputs of starburst99 for two different cluster masses : @xmath73 and @xmath74 , a salpeter imf ( with lower and upper mass cutoffs of @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively ) , instantaneous star formation and solar metallicity .",
    "the solid lines represent the time evolution of the number of ionizing photons ( thin solid line ) and the @xmath33-band absolute magnitude ( thick solid line ) . for simplicity",
    "we only show the detection thresholds for ngc  3256 as dashed - dotted lines at @xmath36mag ( scale on the right hand side of the diagram ) and @xmath77 ( scale on the left hand side of the diagram ) . for a @xmath74 cluster ( lower panel of figure  5 ) , and for ages up to @xmath78myr we will observe a coincidence between an hii region and a near - infrared star cluster ( i.e. , when both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are above their respectively detection thresholds , shown as the closely hatched area ) , assuming no extinction ( see section  5.4.1 ) .",
    "after 7myr and for at least 100myr , we will be able to detect star clusters ( grey area ) , but no coincidences , since @xmath79 has fallen below its threshold .",
    "the case of a starburst99 @xmath73 cluster is displayed in the upper panel of figure  5 .",
    "the detection limits in ngc  3256 will allow us to identify hii regions for up to 5myr ( shown as a lightly hatched area ) and near - infrared star clusters for ages @xmath81myr ( shown as the grey color area ) .",
    "after approximately @xmath82myr , the star clusters will be too faint to be detected with the current detection threshold .",
    "note that for clusters of @xmath73 mass there will be no age for which we could detect both an hii region and a near - infrared star cluster ( that is , there will be no coincidences ) . within the present detection limits , for ngc  3256 and arp  299 star clusters with masses of less than @xmath83",
    "will not be detected as either star clusters or hii regions , as at no time during their evolution will they be brighter than @xmath69mag or @xmath84 , respectively .    for a more extended period of star formation",
    "we have used outputs of rieke et al .",
    "( 1993 ) models with a gaussian star formation rate of 5myr fwhm .",
    "the results are presented in figure  6 for two clusters with masses @xmath85 and @xmath86 for a truncated salpeter imf between 1 and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 between 0.1 and @xmath75 . ] .",
    "figure  6 is coded in the same way as figure  5 .",
    "it is clear that the different star formation rates will produce different fractions of hii regions , coincidences and star cluster detections .",
    "for instance , in the case of a @xmath86 cluster formed in a gaussian burst , we will detect hii regions alone between 3 and 9myr , before the @xmath33-band luminosity of the cluster becomes detectable . in the case of the @xmath85 cluster , because the star formation period is more extended than in the instantaneous burst , it is still possible to have coincidences for a short period of time , between 9 and 12myr .",
    "we now need to assume a mass distribution for the star clusters .",
    "elmegreen & efremov ( 1997 ) proposed that all types of clusters ( young star clusters , globular clusters , open clusters and associations ) form with nearly constant efficiency in gas clouds .",
    "this universal mechanism applies then to all regions regardless of epoch or geometry .",
    "thus the mass distribution of the star clusters in ngc  3256 and arp  299 can be represented as a power law :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the slope of the distribution . from star cluster and hii region lfs",

    "2000 ) which implies that the star clusters / hii regions are not coeval .",
    "we will assume that clusters are formed at a constant rate , so there is a range of ages .",

    "the observed luminosity and mass functions of old globular clusters around galaxies and young star clusters observed in interacting galaxies appear to be distinctively different , with the former having a log - normal shape , and the latter a power law form with no evidence for a turnover ( see for instance elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; whitmore et al .",

    "although including a detailed treatment of the problem of cluster destruction is beyond the scope of this paper , we can attempt to see its effects on our calculations .",

    "the fraction of nuclear pa@xmath1 emission to the total emission varies from system to system , as it depends on factors such as the age of the interaction process , the initial gas content of the galaxies and the relative masses of the galaxies .",

    "however , previously published spectroscopy of a few giant hii regions in arp  299 and ngc  3256 has shown a range of equivalent widths of h@xmath1 , in other words , a range of ages .",
    "a more plausible explanation for the presence of extremely luminous hii regions in lirgs is that the regions of high gas pressure and density present in lirgs , ulirgs and interacting galaxies provide the necessary conditions for the formation of a large number of massive star ( ionizing ) clusters .",
    "such extreme conditions are not likely to occur in normal isolated galaxies .    despite the large numbers of near - infrared sscs and hii regions identified in lirgs",
    ", there is only a small fraction of coincidences  between 4% and 30% of the total number of detected hii regions and star clusters .",
    "this is suggestive of an evolutionary sequence similar to that seen in obscured galactic giant hii regions .",
    "for the first few million years of the cluster evolution , there will be significant amounts of dust which may preclude the detection of the ionizing cluster .",
    "as the cluster ages , stellar winds and supernovae will dissipate part of the gas and dust , and the star cluster will become visible , whereas at the same time the hii region emission will be less luminous .",
    "we have used evolutionary synthesis models to reproduce the observed relative fractions of young and intermediate hii regions / clusters and old clusters in arp  299 and ngc  3256 . based on the observed fractions",
    "we have concluded that most likely the star formation occurs in instantaneous bursts rather than more extended periods of star formation .",
    "using instantaneous star formation and a salpeter imf we have derived photometric masses of the detected star clusters of between @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the fact that the peak of the @xmath33-band luminosity occurs after approximately 9myr whereas at the same time the number of ionizing photons has dropped by about two orders of magnitudes from the maximum explains the limited number of coincidences .",
    "within the present detection limits in arp  299 and ngc  3256 , we can only detect both hii region emission and a star cluster for the most massive clusters ( @xmath6 ) during the first 7myr .",
    "the near - infrared clusters with no detected hii region emission will be older than approximately 7myr .",
    "the hii regions with no detected cluster counterpart are most likely younger than 5myr , and have intermediate mass ( @xmath159 ) ionizing clusters .",
    "if , as observed in obscured galactic hii regions , there are significant amounts of extinction during the first million years of the evolution of clusters and hii regions , then we may be missing the youngest star forming regions , and hence the observed fractions of hii regions and coincidences will be lower limits .",
    "an estimate of the age distribution of the * observed * clusters can be inferred from the relative numbers of hii regions , and near - infrared star clusters : the higher the fraction of near - infrared clusters , the older the ages of the detected star clusters will be .",

    "older clusters possibly created in this or previous episodes of star formation are likely to exist in these systems but can not be identified with the present detection threshold .",
    "another possibility to explain the apparent youth of the clusters in arp  299 and ngc  3256 would be destruction of clusters . in that case , if the clusters have been created at a constant rate for the last @xmath160myr , then roughly 50% of the clusters are destroyed during that time to account for the observed fraction of clusters in these two systems .",
    "the data presented in this paper does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities .    from the present observations and modelling",
    "it is clear that a large population of the youngest clusters ( that is the ionizing clusters of the hii regions with ages of @xmath161myr ) will not be detected from near - infrared continuum imaging alone , as only some @xmath162 of these hii regions in our sample of lirgs ( both isolated and interacting / merging systems ) appear to have near - infrared cluster counterparts .",

    "<S> these observations have revealed the presence of a large population of super star clusters and bright hii regions . </S>",
    "<S> a significant fraction of the hii regions shows h@xmath1 luminosities above that of 30 doradus , the prototypical giant hii region . </S>",
    "<S> the excess of extremely luminous hii regions in lirgs has been confirmed by comparison with normal galaxies observed at similar spatial resolutions . despite the large numbers of identified star clusters and hii regions in lirgs , we only find a small fraction of coincidences , between 4% and 30% of the total number of detected sources . using evolutionary synthesis models </S>",
    "<S> we have reproduced the relative fractions of young hii regions , intermediate and old star clusters observed in arp  299 and the central region ngc  3256 using a salpeter imf and instantaneous star formation . </S>",
    "<S> hii regions with no detected near - infrared cluster counterpart ( @xmath3% of the detected sources ) represent the youngest sites of star formation , with ages of up to approximately 5myr and mostly intermediate mass ( @xmath4 ) ionizing clusters . </S>",
    "<S> for these two galaxies , and within the present detection threshold we can only detect coincidences ( @xmath5% of the detected sources ) between an hii region and a near - infrared star cluster for the most massive star clusters ( @xmath6 ) during the first 7myr of their evolution . </S>",
    "<S> if there is significant extinction during the first million years , we may not detect the youngest star forming regions , and hence the observed fractions of hii regions and coincidences will be lower limits . </S>",
    "<S> the identified near - infrared sscs with no detectable pa@xmath1 emission represent the `` old '' population ( @xmath7% of the detected sources ) , with ages of between 7 and @xmath8myr . </S>",
    "<S> older clusters possibly created in this or previous episodes of star formation are likely to exist in these systems but can not be identified with the present detection threshold . </S>",
    "<S> our study demonstrates that pa@xmath1 narrow - band imaging of lirgs and interacting galaxies identifies the youngest sites of star formation that could be otherwise missed by near - infrared broad - band continuum surveys . </S>"
