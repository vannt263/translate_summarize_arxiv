    "magnetic fields are known to play an important role in star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field is often measured using the zeeman effect or faraday rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of the sky can be deduced through continuum polarization measurements .",
    "far - infrared continuum polarization is due to emission from elongated dust grains that align perpendicularly to the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the same reason , optical light that has undergone partial absorption by dust grains exhibits polarization parallel to the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in general the magnetic field lines of the milky way follow the direction of the spiral arms ( often measured via faraday rotation of pulsar signals ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since dust polarization vectors are orthogonal to magnetic field lines , the galactic magnetic field should induce a tendency for mapped polarization angles to be perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "external galaxies also show magnetic fields following the spiral arms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but on small scales ( about 20pc in the case of ngc 6946 ) localized processes ( e.g. , star formation ) dominate , tangling magnetic field lines @xcite",
    ".    the 350@xmath0 m hertz polarimeter module was located at the caltech submillimeter observatory and operated from 1994 to 2003 .",
    "the hertz polarimeter was well - suited for polarization measurements that probe the dense environments around forming stars , specifically clumps and cores .",
    "since the decommissioning of hertz , @xcite have published an archive of 56 different objects , 52 of which are galactic star forming regions . in this paper , we use this relatively large dataset of star - forming regions to calculate a single large - scale ( up to an angular diameter of about 10 arcminutes ) average degree of polarization ( @xmath1 , percentage of wave that is polarized ) , position angle ( @xmath2 ) , and flux density ( @xmath3 ) for each of the 52 star - forming hertz datasets .",
    "the data are then explored to test whether the magnetic fields of these regions have any statistical relationship to the galactic magnetic field .",
    "@xcite applied a similar analysis on visible polarization of 3000 stars ( from the @xcite dataset ) that are in the galactic plane .",
    "they found that the measured optical polarization angles from most stars , particularly those at further distances , are parallel to the galactic magnetic field .",
    "@xcite found that optical polarization measurements had a sinusoidal dependence with respect to galactic longitude .",
    "however , we note that the observations probe very different physical regions : submillimeter observations probe dense regions ( @xmath4 ) while optical observations probe diffuse regions ( @xmath5 ) . although dust polarization of star formation regions has been compared to the galactic plane magnetic field before , the studies have been limited to small sample sizes .",
    "continuum polarimetry at @xmath6  =  0.8 and 1.3 mm of approximately 10 star formation sources ( at scales of @xmath71 ) revealed no correlation for the magnetic field direction with respect to the galactic plane @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite analyzed the dust polarization of 4 giant molecular clouds ( capturing most of the clouds on scales of @xmath710 ) at 450@xmath0 m and found that 3 of these have a significant field aligned within @xmath8 of the galactic plane .",
    "our dataset probes similar regions , but we have a much larger sample size that will constrain , with much higher confidence , the relationship of the magnetic field to the galactic plane",
    ".    our results do not show any similar correlation for degree of polarization or angle with galactic location .",
    "an in - depth analysis was applied for @xmath2 by binning data based on galactic longitude and spiral arm locations , again suggesting no correlation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ oda ] we discuss our data and the analysis methods used .",
    "it also shows that a single polarization angle for each dataset is typically meaningful .",
    "our results are presented in  [ results ] and discussed in  [ discussion ] .",
    "for the 52 analyzed hertz datasets , there were an average of about 90 telescope beams per object . for each telescope beam , the following values were of interest : degree of polarization ( @xmath1 ) , polarization position angle ( @xmath2 ) , flux density ( @xmath3 ) , and the uncertainties on each .",
    "outliers were removed for measurements with @xmath9 , which is the @xmath10 point of a gaussian distribution with a @xmath11 full width at half maximum ( most datasets have this or better ) .",
    "after these cuts , the average and median telescope beams per cloud were 82 and 56 respectively .    for each object , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 values",
    "were used to calculate the stokes parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these were then summed to find the large - scale average , converting back to mean @xmath1s and @xmath2s .",
    "uncertainties were propagated .",
    "a similar technique was used in @xcite .",
    "the mean angles were rotated from equatorial to galactic coordinates .",
    "the spherical trigonometry for this transformation is discussed in the appendix .",
    "since we are not able to measure circular polarization with hertz , the stokes parameter @xmath14 is assumed to be 0 ; it is expected to actually be near this value .",
    "circular polarization is also not relevant for average field direction . from @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ,",
    "measured at a beam location ( @xmath18 ) in a source map , the following formulas were used to find the corresponding @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21    @xmath22    from here , unweighted sums of @xmath19 and @xmath20 were calculated in order to obtain @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , an unweighted sum for intensity , @xmath25 , was found .",
    "these quantities are not weighted by standard deviation and represent the sums as if the clouds were observed with a larger telescope beam . by using error propagation to calculate @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "it is found :    @xmath28    @xmath29    the variances for @xmath30 and @xmath31 were found by summing the variances of each beam measurement :    @xmath32    this method of calculating the standard deviation accounts for errors due to measurement in uncorrelated linear datasets .",
    "the variance for @xmath33 was calculated similarly .    from @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "can now be calculated .",
    "@xmath34 is seen below :    @xmath36    the calculation of @xmath35 is more complicated .",
    "@xmath35 must always be positive , and the arctangent term does not discriminate on which qs and us are negative .",
    "the following formulae successfully determines the proper @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath37    @xmath38    in order to calculate the variances for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , propagation of error was used again : @xmath39    @xmath40    it is important to note that equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) do not incorporate the non - diagonal ( correlation ) terms of covariance matrices , which are necessary for proper propagation of error . the @xcite datasets do not report correlation terms from their original coordinate transformation of @xmath3 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , other correlation terms exist , such as observational correlations and correlations between adjacent beams .",
    "more accurate calculations of uncertainties are not motivated for the analysis and conclusions of this paper , but it should be noted that without the correlation terms , uncertainties are approximate .",
    "our results for a large - scale average are consistent with the polarimetric maps in @xcite .",
    "although de - biasing @xmath34 , as discussed by @xcite , is an important part in the analysis of @xmath34 implied by @xmath41 , it was not done on these data since it does not modify the polarization angle ( the primary focus for results in this paper ) .",
    "the hertz averages were analyzed in three ways : 1 ) investigating each of the 52 hertz sources separately ; 2 ) separating the sources by galactic arm ; and 3 ) combining near - by databases ( i.e. , data within @xmath42 in galactic longitude and less than 200pc apart along the line of sight ) . the last technique reduces the amount of total datasets to 22 `` complexes . ''      to investigate whether a meaningful mean direction of the magnetic field exists or whether , instead , angles in the hertz datasets are random ( follow a uniform angle distribution ) we used a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "out of the 52 datasets , 42 were inconsistent with a random distribution of angles at a 90% confidence level . by looking at the polarimetric maps in @xcite , the 10 datasets that exhibited a scatter consistent with a random distribution were maps that had poor signal - to - noise or had `` circular - like '' morphology ( e.g. , w75n ) .",
    "in this paper , our analysis was conducted in three ways : keeping these ten datasets ; omitting these datasets ; and analyzing these datasets by themselves . in all cases",
    ", we arrived at consistent conclusions .    similarly , for the 22 complexes , 17 were inconsistent with a random distribution of angles at a 90% confidence level .",
    "thus , the data have a meaningful large - scale average angle that is inconsistent with random processes for @xmath4380% of the sources and @xmath4377% of the complexes with 90% confidence .    a similar conclusion can also be obtained by using the normalized stokes parameters and @xmath44 . ] : @xmath45 @xmath46    the values of the normalized stokes parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 at each pointing position within a cloud must be in the range [ @xmath49,@xmath50 .",
    "random samples drawn from a uniform distribution of angles should have an average @xmath47 and @xmath48 of 0 . with a finite number of samples we can only expect that average to reach zero within some uncertainty . with approximately 56 samples per cloud , from a uniform distribution of angles",
    "we expect @xmath51 approximately @xmath52 . for the hertz sample of 52 clouds ,",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath53 are in the range @xmath54 to 0.74 , significantly above the expectations for a uniform distribution of angles .    when taking the averages of the magnitudes of @xmath51 and @xmath53 for the clouds and complexes , a similar argument holds .",
    "we define @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( i.e. , the average magnitudes of @xmath51 and @xmath53 ) for the 52 clouds .",
    "the uncertainty due to the finite sample of 52 clouds is slightly increased from the previous paragraph .",
    "that is , for a uniform random distribution of angles we expect @xmath57 and @xmath58 to have a standard deviation of 0.10 .",
    "the actual values for our dataset are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , significantly larger than what could be expected from a uniform random distribution . for the 22 complexes a uniform distribution",
    "gives a standard deviation of 0.15 .",
    "the actual values for our dataset are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are both significant at an 80% confidence level .",
    "in this section we present an extensive examination of possible correlations between galactic coordinates ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , degree of polarization ( @xmath65 ) , galactic polarization angle ( @xmath66 ; transformation from @xmath35 is discussed in the appendix ) , and intensity ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "section 3.1 focuses on correlations with galactic coordinates .",
    "section 3.2 bins data based on galactic arms . in both cases",
    "no relationship between location and @xmath66 was established .",
    "table 1 shows the data for each individual object and its associated complex ; note that large clouds ( e.g. , omc-1 for the fourth complex in table 1 ) may be dominant for the calculated galactic angle for a complex .",
    "table 2 summarizes the coefficient of determination ( i.e. , the square of the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient ) , @xmath68 , for most of the comparisons done .",
    "finally , section 3.3 examines correlation orthogonal to the milky way s magnetic field .",

    "the results in this paper imply that cloud cores usually have a meaningful net field ( which may correlate with other cores in the same complex , @xcite ) that has no preferred direction within the galaxy , yet are embedded in a diffuse medium in an ordered , galactic large - scale field .",
    "@xcite did a similar analysis as this paper , but with a different methodology .",
    "they analyzed the line - of - sight magnetic fields through zeeman splitting of oh masers in massive star - forming regions ; on sub - kiloparsec scales ( about 0.5kpc ) , two sources often had opposite line - of - sight field directions , suggesting multiple cores in a complex tangle the magnetic fields . in some areas of the galaxy , @xcite found some line - of - sight field alignment in parts of the sagittarius arm and norma arm on scales of about 2kpc .",
    "still , they also found no evidence for correlations of magnetic field directions in star - forming regions with the galactic field or with the spiral arms on larger scales .",
    "the cloud formation process involves instabilities on galactic scales @xcite , which are responsible for the accumulation of enough mass to form the clouds . at the same time , these instabilities generate turbulence in the ism of the galaxy .",
    "the cloud magnetic field is thus expected to decouple from the galactic field during the cloud formation process .",
    "stellar feedback is an additional mechanism driving the cloud magnetic field away from alignment with the galactic field direction .",
    "these effects are likely responsible for the dichotomy between the arm / interarm regions in terms of the ratio of strengths between the ordered and tangled components of the magnetic field observed in external galaxies @xcite .",
