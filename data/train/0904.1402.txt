    "there is a growing consensus for the need of a non - equilibrium theory of economics @xcite . from a purely theoretical perspective",
    ", one would like to understand how the economy chooses one of the multitude of possible equilibria .",
    "an important and perhaps more practical question , is to determine which of the equilibrium states are stable . in other words ,",
    "given a small perturbation away from such a state , does the system relaxes back to the same equilibrium , or does it settles to a completely different state ?",
    "this is similar to the so - called _ landscape problem _ found in some areas of physics such as string theory , frustrated magnets and protein folding .    constructing a full non - linear economic theory out of equilibrium",
    "presents many problems .",
    "is price a meaningful concept out of equilibrium ? how do we model the interactions of many heterogeneous agents ? _ etc .",
    "_ usually these questions are tackled by computer simulations using _ agent - based models _ @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the simpler case of a pure exchange economy with no production .",
    "we develop an analytic formalism to study linearized perturbations around any equilibrium state .",
    "our approach is probabilistic , and we make heavy use of mean field theory techniques . before setting up the perturbation theory , we study the landscape of equilibria for the pure exchange economy . since the dynamics of the economy should not depend on the units used to measure the different products , there is a kind of  gauge \" symmetry in the problem @xcite .",
    "we show that this symmetry induces an equivalence relation in the landscape of equilibria .",
    "in fact , in the limit of many agents , we show that the set of equivalence classes of economic equilibria is in one - to - one correspondence with the space of wealth distributions .",
    "one of the main questions that we ask is : what is the importance of the trading network topology in determining the final state of the economy ? for a related study , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we find that , under some more restrictive assumptions on the nature of the possible equilibrium states , the final state is completely determined in terms of the initial conditions of the linearized perturbation .",
    "in particular , it is independent of the details of the non - equilibrium dynamics and trading network structure .",
    "we find that the main role of the network topology is to determine the relaxation time . in our approach , prices are emergent and describe the relative flow of products between different agents .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study the landscape of equilibria of the pure exchange economy . in section iii",
    ", we describe the probabilistic rules that drive the dynamics of the system , and derive mean field theory evolution equations for the linearized perturbations . in section iv",
    ", we state and prove our main result regarding the universality of the final wealth distribution .",
    "section v contains two examples with specific indices of satisfaction . in the first example",
    ", we deal with homogeneous static preferences .",
    "we show the corresponding relaxation to equilibrium , and the relation between the relaxation time and the network topology . in the second example , we study heterogeneous dynamic preferences . more precisely , we take agents that update their preferences as they trade .",
    "again , we show how the network topology affects the relaxation time to equilibrium .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "our system includes a set of _ agents _ @xmath0 and a set of _ products _ @xmath1 . the amount of product @xmath2 owned by agent @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "we work with continuous variables , but the results can also be recasted in a discrete setting .",
    "we shall define an _ index of satisfaction _",
    "@xmath5 specifying the preferences for each agent @xmath3 .",

    ", it follows that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes time .",
    "when agents have time changing preferences , we have @xmath13 . since the amount of each product can be measured in arbitrary units , the dynamics of the economy should be invariant under a transformation@xmath14{lll}% $ n_{\\alpha}^{i}\\mapsto\\phi^{i}n_{\\alpha}^{i},$ & where & $ \\phi^{i}% \\in\\mathbb{r}^{+}.$% \\end{tabular } \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\label{gauge}%\\ ] ] this defines an equivalence class of all @xmath4 and @xmath15 ( even at different times ) such that @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , we assume that @xmath17 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath18 the _ exchange rate _ of the products @xmath2 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath20 .",
    "_ equilibrium _ ( or _ steady state _ )  in a pure exchange economy is a set of inventories @xmath21 and exchange rates @xmath22 that satisfy the maximization conditions @xmath23 leading to @xmath24 the solutions of eq .",

    "( [ equilibrium ] ) implies a _ consistency condition _ ,",
    "@xmath26 giving then rise to transitive matrices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the most general solution can be written as@xmath27_{j}^{i},\\label{nbar}%\\ ] ] where @xmath28_{j}^{i}$ ] are _ local _ and _ dimensionless _ functions of the exchange rates , coming directly from the preferences of the individual agents , and independent of the inventories .",

    "therefore , the solutions described by eq .",
    "( [ nbar ] ) are in the same equivalence class of the solutions of @xmath29_{j}^{i}\\bar{n}_{\\alpha}^{j}$ ] .",
    "it follows that the space of equilibria at any point in time can be mapped to a set @xmath30 for a specific product , say @xmath31 .",
    "however , there is still a residual symmetry @xmath32 .",
    "we can use this symmetry to set @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the landscapes of the equivalence classes of equilibria at any point in time is the manifold @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath35 goes to infinity there is a one - to - one correspondance between elements of this space and the distributions of wealth . on the other hand",
    "the total non - equilibrium kinematic space is @xmath36 .",
    "before proceeding , we need to make clear what we mean by non - equilibrium \" . as we mentioned in the previous section , one can have time - dependent equilibria .",
    "for example , suppose that agents have time dependent preferences .",
    "we can then find a one - parameter family of _ smooth _ functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , constrained by @xmath39 , so that the maximization conditions in eq .",
    "( [ equilibrium ] ) are obeyed for any @xmath12 .",
    "if we regard @xmath12 as a time coordinate , such map would define a time - dependent pure - exchange economy in equilibrium .",
    "note that agents are still making exchanges , but these are infinitesimal , _ i.e. _ , @xmath40 .    if the economy is out of equilibrium , the maximization conditions ( [ equilibrium ] ) are not obeyed .",
    "this means that there is an excess demand or supply of products .",
    "agents must then barter between each other in order to find an equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the amount that they will trade will be _",
    "finite_. in what follows we derive a set of equations to describe the dynamics of the economy out of equilibrium .",
    "this is done under a minimal set of assumptions which we shall discuss next .",
    "let @xmath37 be a one - parameter family of equilibrium states as discussed above .",
    "we can always decompose the agents inventories as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a finite deviation from the particular equilibrium trajectory @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath43 , be the _",
    "finite _ amount of product @xmath2 that agent @xmath3 gets ( or gives ) in a trade with product @xmath19 and agent @xmath44 out of equilibrium .",
    "we assume that @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ( finite ) corrections to the inventory are of the order of the deviation from equilibrium .",
    "after a trade with agent @xmath44 , agent @xmath3 updates its inventory as @xmath46 @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , for @xmath49by product conservation , we must have @xmath50 and trivially @xmath51 . finally , under the transformation given by eq .",
    "( [ gauge ] ) , we must have @xmath52 . by definition , @xmath43 is the amount of product @xmath53 that agents @xmath3 and @xmath44 must exchange in order to be in equilibrium with each other .",
    "the precise form of @xmath43 can be calculated near equilibrium with an expansion in terms of the fluctuations @xmath54 .",
    "such an expansion is called _",
    "perturbation theory_. for now , we will work with a general @xmath43 which obeys the basic properties given above .",
    "in order to properly define a non - equilibrium economic theory , one must deal with the question of how agents interacts .",
    "we will do this in a probabilistic way . in this setting , time is continuous and when we take an infinitesimal time interval @xmath55 $ ] , we assume that @xmath56 is so small that any agent can make _ at most _ one barter process . let @xmath57 be the probability per unit time that agent @xmath3 will encounter agent @xmath44 and make a barter round involving product @xmath2 and @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath60 ; _ ( iv ) _ @xmath61 ; _ ( v ) _ @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 for every @xmath64 then the agents can be seen as located on the nodes of a complete network on @xmath65 nodes , _",
    "i.e. _ , a network in which every two nodes are connected by a link . on the other hand",
    ", we may define @xmath66 based directly on the structure of a chosen network .",
    "the network establishes a constraing in the interaction between agents .",
    "namely , given a network on @xmath65 nodes , we can associate the agents to the nodes and prescribe that @xmath63 only if there is a link between @xmath3 and @xmath44 .",
    "given an inventory at time @xmath12 , @xmath67 , the expected value at time @xmath68 of the non - equilibrium fluctuations , provided the information at time @xmath12 , is @xmath69 &   = \\left (   1-dt\\sum_{j,\\beta}% \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}^{ij}(t)\\right )   \\delta n_{\\alpha}^{i}(t)\\label{nnew}\\\\ &   + dt\\sum_{j,\\beta}\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}^{ij}(t)[\\delta n_{\\alpha}% ^{i}(t)+\\delta n_{\\alpha\\beta}^{ij}(t)].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term comes from the probability of no interactions ; the second term is the contribution from the trading interactions . taking an expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ nnew ] ) at time @xmath12 on both sides , we obtain an expression for the unconditional expectations , which we denote by @xmath70:@xmath71 we can always write the fluctuations in terms of a scale invariant variable @xmath72 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath73 . the evolution equations for the scale invariant perturbations take the form@xmath74    in order to study perturbations in more detail , we need an explicit expression for the solution of the bartering problem @xmath43 , and for the probabilities @xmath66 .",
    "it turns out that one can find an explicit expression for @xmath43 , when agents are assumed to be in a near - equilibrium state .",
    "this was given in @xcite .",
    "we quote the result here : @xmath75 and@xmath76@xmath77^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . at equilibrium , we know that @xmath80",
    ". therefore , @xmath81 as expected .",
    "in section ii , we showed that the only relevant scale invariant quantity in equilibrium is the wealth distribution . here",
    "we will show that under certain more restrictive assumptions about the index of satisfaction , the final wealth distribution can be found in terms of the initial conditions of the perturbations , and it is _ independent on the details of the non - equilibrium dynamics_. we show that this only happens if the following conditions are met : in any of the possible equilibria , the index of satisfaction is _",
    "( i ) _ time - independent , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath82 ; _ ( ii ) _ the same for all agents",
    ". these are necessary conditions for isolating the effects of the network that determines interactions .",
    "however , we leave open the possibility that , while out of equilibrium , the index of satisfaction might be time dependent and agents might have different preferences .",
    "in fact , in section v we will give a particular example of this case .",
    "the key to our result , can be traced to the fact that under the conditions given above , there are extra conserved quantities arising from eq .",
    "( [ nkin ] ) . under _ ( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ , the solution to the equilibrium equation must have the form , @xmath83 for any equilibrium state . here",
    "we have written @xmath84 , since _",
    "( ii)_. the fact that we can decompose @xmath85 as above , follows from the consistency relations that @xmath85 must obey ( see eqs .",
    "( [ cons ] ) and [ nbar ] ) .",
    "the functions @xmath86 are assumed to be time - independent from _ ( i ) _ , therefore the possible equilibria will also be time independent .",
    "we have already seen that product number is conserved in the barter process .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ nkin ] ) we have @xmath87 . however , there are more subtle conservation laws not evident from eq .",
    "( [ nkin ] ) , but arising in the linearized approximation . under this approximation",
    "we can write @xmath88 that is , agents are trading at approximately the same exchange rate as in equilibrium . using eqs .",
    "( [ equil ] ) in ( [ linear ] ) one can easily show that @xmath89 by eq .",
    "( [ linear1 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ nkin ] ) it follows that @xmath90    the next step is to find the asymptotic prices at @xmath91 . of course",
    ", we need to assume that the system reaches some other equilibrium state .",
    "hence , @xmath92 note that in writing eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) we have assumed that the form of @xmath93 as a function of prices is the same at @xmath91 that at @xmath94 .",
    "this follows from @xmath95 . summing over @xmath96 , under the linearized approximation",
    ", we get @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath100 are conserved quantities , and hence are given in terms of the initial conditions of the perturbations .",
    "one can then use eq .",
    "( [ mfinal ] ) to solve for the final prices in terms of the equilibrium state we are expanding around , and the initial conditions for the perturbations .",
    "we are now in the position to deal with the final wealth distribution . in units of product @xmath2",
    ", we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "we note that this is also a conserved quantity , and so it is given by its initial value . since @xmath103 can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ mfinal ] ) in terms of the initial perturbations , we have the followin result :    consider a pure exchange economy , with the space for all equivalence classes of equilibria determined by the scale transformation in eq .",
    "( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "let us assume that the index of satisfaction at equilibrium is _",
    "( i ) _ time - independent and _ ( ii ) _ the same for all agents .",
    "moreover , let us assume that given an initial non - equilibrium linearized fluctuation , the system will go back to some equilibrium state at time @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the wealth distribution is completely determined in terms of the initial conditions of the perturbation and it is independent on the non - equilibrium dynamics . in particular , it is independent of the probabilities and the network of interaction between agents .",
    "as a special case , consider an homogeneous equilibrium state @xmath105 . in this case , all agents have the same wealth , @xmath106 , say . for simplicity , assume that @xmath107 .",
    "then , given an initial perturbation @xmath108 , the final wealth of the economy is given by , @xmath109+\\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i}x_{\\alpha}^{i}(0)\\right )   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , we see that since @xmath110 is conserved , the final equilibrium state of the economy will generically be non - homogeneous",
    ". however , note that if @xmath111 for every @xmath3 and @xmath44 , the final wealth distribution will again be homogeneous , and thus related by a a scale transformation to @xmath106 .",
    "we discuss here a particular example to clarify the role of the probabilities @xmath66 , the network of interaction , and the stability of the non - equilibrium perturbations .",
    "agents are associated to the nodes of a fixed network .",
    "each agent can interact with exactly @xmath112 other fixed agents , _",
    "i.e. _ , the network is modeled by a @xmath112-regular graph .",
    "let @xmath113 be the adjacency matrix of the network : @xmath114 if @xmath115 for at least two products @xmath2 and @xmath19 ; @xmath116 , otherwise .",
    "when the probability of trading two specific products is uniform , we have @xmath117 .",
    "we study in the following case of homogeneous time - independent index of satisfaction:@xmath118 this index trivially satisfies all the previous assumptions .",
    "therefore , the final wealth distribution will be independent on the dynamics . in this simple example",
    ", one can obtain an analytical solution to the bartering problem : @xmath119 .",
    "next , we note that the equilibrium equations ( [ equilibrium ] ) for this system reduce to @xmath120 .",
    "it is then easy to see from eqs .",
    "( [ dni1 ] ) and ( [ dni2 ] ) that @xmath121 .",
    "therefore the equation for the scale invariant perturbations becomes @xmath122 these equations can be seen as the direct analog of the wealth dynamic equations proposed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , our perturbation theory can be seen as providing a microeconomic foundation to the results of @xcite .",
    "however , we do not include a stochastic source term , which would keep the system out of equilibrium .",
    "the presence of such a term can be directly linked to the fat - tailed wealth distribution obtained in @xcite .",
    "we can readily see from eq .",
    "( [ dxi1 ] ) the conserved quantities found in the last section : @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "hence , the final wealth distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ finalw ] ) .",
    "we are interested in showing that there are no instabilities , and so the economy indeed equilibrates .",
    "the role of the network is to determine the convergence rate towards equilibrium , in evident analogy with the notion of mixing time for random walks on graphs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us write eq .",
    "( [ dxi1 ] ) in vector notation as , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 being @xmath128 the @xmath129 identity matrix , @xmath130 the @xmath131 all - one matrix , and @xmath132 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath133 are @xmath134 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the eigenvalues of @xmath130 and @xmath137 respectively .",
    "it follows that there are @xmath65 steady states associated with @xmath138 .",
    "these correspond to the conserved quantities @xmath139 .",
    "the remaining eigenvalues are @xmath140 . because @xmath137 is doubly stochastic , @xmath141 $ ] and @xmath142 .",
    "so , @xmath143 and there is no instability .",
    "the rate of convergence is determined by the _",
    "eigenvalue gap _",
    "@xmath144 of the matrix @xmath137 .",
    "the network does not affect the wealth distribution but it gives the rate of convergence towards equilibrium .",
    "as expected , the larger the eigenvalue gap , the faster is the convergence .",
    "graphs with good expansion properties are then associated with fast relaxation .",
    "[ fig1 ] gives an example for the complete graph and the cycle graph on six vertices , using the same initial conditions .",
    "the numerical simulation is consistent with the mean field theory .",
    "the simulations are obtained taking eq .",

    "( [ util2 ] ) is arbitrary .",
    "we will build a model where agents can learn the  market \" exchange rates when they barter with other agents .",

    "note that even though in this model agents have time - dependent preferences out of equilibrium , they all converge to homogeneous preferences in equilibrium .",
    "this means that this model obeys the simplifying assumptions of section ii , and hence the final wealth distribution is independent of the non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "now we need to provide a model of how the agents learn the new prices .",

    "we have used eqs .",
    "( [ dni1 ] ) and ( [ dni2 ] ) .",
    "this way of updating prices makes sure that the exchange rates @xmath148 always obey the consistency condition ( see eq .",
    "( [ cons ] ) ) .",

    "we take the same initial conditions for the scale invariant perturbations , and fix the network to be the complete graph .",
    "we see that , as expected , the final state is the same for both models .",
    "however , for the changing preferences model , there are large oscillations due to the fact that the eigenvalues given in eq .",

    "in this paper we have introduced a theory of linearized perturbations around a pure exchange economy . our formalism is given in terms of a general index of satisfaction , and the probabilities of agents interacting on a network .",
    "we have shown that , if agents have static preferences , which are also homogeneous in any of the steady states , the final wealth distribution is independent of the dynamics of the non - equilibrium theory . in particular ,",
    "it is completely determined in terms of the initial conditions , and it is independent of the probability and the network of interaction between agents . we have shown that the main effect of the network is to determine the relaxation time to equilibrium .",

    "some simulations of this kind were conducted in @xcite in the context of a centralized market .",
    "these speculations can lead to stochastic terms analog to the ones proposed in @xcite . finally , we have only considered agents making barter exchanges at a fixed time . an important component of the economy is that agents are able to make exchanges at different times .",

    "<S> we develop a formalism to study linearized perturbations around the equilibria of a pure exchange economy . with the use of mean field theory techniques , we derive equations for the flow of products in an economy driven by heterogeneous preferences and probabilistic interaction between agents . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to show that if the economic agents have static preferences , which are also homogeneous in any of the steady states , the final wealth distribution is independent of the dynamics of the non - equilibrium theory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is completely determined in terms of the initial conditions , and it is independent of the probability , and the network of interaction between agents . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the main effect of the network is to determine the relaxation time via the usual eigenvalue gap as in random walks on graphs . </S>"
