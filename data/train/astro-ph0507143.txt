    "the extragalactic portion of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al .  2004 ) first look survey ( hereafter xfls ) was one of the first observations made with _ spitzer _ after the completion of science verification at the end of november 2003 .",
    "the aim of this 67hr survey was to characterize the extragalactic source populations observed with _ spitzer _ down to sub - millijansky levels in the mid - infrared .",
    "observations covering the survey areas were made with both the infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004a ) and the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) .",
    "this paper discusses the irac observations , the mips observations will be discussed in future papers ( fadda et al .  in preparation ; frayer et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "irac takes images in four broad bands ( termed channels ) .",
    "channel 1 is centered at a nominal wavelength of 3.6@xmath0 m , channel 2 at 4.5@xmath0 m , channel 3 at 5.8@xmath0 m and channel 4 at 8.0@xmath0 m .",
    "light enters the instrument through two apertures , one for channels 1 and 3 , and one for channels 2 and 4 .",
    "the centers of the two apertures are separated by about @xmath8 on the sky .",
    "beamsplitters split the short and long wavelength light in each aperture .",
    "the light in channels 1 and 2 is detected by two @xmath9 insb arrays , and that in channels 3 and 4 is detected by two @xmath10 sias arrays .",
    "all arrays have the same pixel size , corresponding to @xmath11 per pixel , giving a @xmath12 field of view .",
    "the pipeline - processed irac data from the xfls were publicly released at the end of april 2004 . in this paper",
    ", we describe the data analysis which we performed to improve the data quality beyond the scope of the standard pipeline processing , including a discussion of the removal of artifacts from the data .",
    "we present irac source catalogs for the xfls , and discuss good observing practices for future surveys of this nature .",
    "nine astronomical observation requests ( aors ) cover the main field survey area of 3.8deg@xmath13 centered on r.a.(j2000 ) @xmath14 , dec.(j2000 ) @xmath15 in a @xmath16 grid in array ( row , column ) coordinates .",
    "each aor was an approximately @xmath17 map with 277@xmath18 offsets .",
    "the small 5-point gaussian dither pattern with 12s frametime was used .",
    "this pattern has a mean offset of 28@xmath18 .",
    "data in the verification area ( a 0.25 deg@xmath19 area within the main field centered on r.a.(j2000 ) @xmath20 , dec.(j2000 ) @xmath21 ) was taken using three aors with 12s frametimes with the same dither and mapping strategy as the main field and three much deeper aors with 30s frametimes using the first sixteen points from the small cycling dither pattern , which has a mean offset of 13@xmath18 .",
    "these aors are all contained in _ spitzer _",
    "program identification number ( pid ) 26 ( principal investigator ( p.i . ) t.  soifer ) .",
    "in addition , a second field in the elais - n1 region , centered on r.a.(j2000 ) @xmath22 , dec.(2000 ) @xmath23 was observed as part of a study of source confusion as a test field for the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) , and this has also been included in the xfls ( pid 196 , p.i .",
    "m.  dickinson ) .",
    "these data consisted of a two position map separated by 312@xmath18 , with the first 36 dithers from the medium cycling pattern and a 200s frametime .",
    "the map was oriented to avoid overlap between the channel 1/3 and channel 2/4 fields of view , thus , unlike the main and verification fields , a typical sky position in the image only has two channel coverage .",
    "details of the xfls aors , along with their aor identification numbers ( aorids ) are given in table 1 .",
    "the aors can be downloaded using the spot tool ( available from http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/propkit/spot/ ) , selecting the `` view program '' option and specifying the appropriate pid .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]      the four - band catalogs contain the following fields : _ x , y _ - pixel coordinates of the source in the shortest - wavelength mosaic in which it was detected , _ ra , dec _ - right ascension and declination of the source in the shortest - wavelength mosaic in which it was detected ( j2000 coordinates ) , _",
    "ch1 i d , ch2 i d , ch3 i d , ch4 i d _ - identifiers in the four single - band catalogs ( defaults to -1 for non - detections in a given band ) , _ ch1 flux , err ch1 _ - channel 1 flux density and uncertainty in the `` best '' aperture , _",

    "ch4 err _ channel 4 flux density and uncertainty , _ aper _ - aperture used for flux density measurements , _ flag _ - see table 4 , _ dflg _ - sum of the detection flag bits , see discussion in section 4",
    ".    objects with no coverage in a given band have their flux densities in that band set to 99999.0 . otherwise , non - detections have their fluxes set to the appropriate catalog limit , or a 3-@xmath24 limit , whichever is higher .    table 8 shows the numbers of sources in each catalog as a function of detection flag . of 93689 channel 1",
    "main field detections , 62161 ( 66% ) are also detected in channel 2 , 9826 ( 10% ) are detected in channel 3 and 10235 ( 11% ) are detected in channel 4 .",
    "the observations for the xfls were designed well before launch , when the knowledge of the properties of the instrument was rather limited . with the benefit of hindsight",
    "we would have changed a number of aspects of the design .",
    "the greater than expected scattered light problems , and the latent image problems in channel 1 both could have been mitigated by using a larger dither pattern ( with arcminute - scale dithers ) and/or half array offsets in the mapping strategy . on the other hand ,",
    "one correct decision was to maintain a relatively high coverage factor ( five over the main field ) .",
    "this allowed reliable cosmic ray rejection , and the extra redundancy allowed us to use the scattered light masks effectively .",
    "future reprocessings of the xfls data should be able to improve the accuracy of the fluxes .",
    "for example , we may be able to use color - dependent flat fields to obtain more accurate fluxes by applying the flat field appropriate to the color of each object using an iterative technique .",
    "also , we may be able to use improved source extraction techniques based on a development of the ssc point source extractor to optimally - extract the typically slightly extended irac sources , and properly quantify the confusion in the elais - n1 channel 1 and 2 data .",
    "these improvements were considered to be beyond the scope of this work , where our purpose is to provide a reliable and fairly complete catalog on a reasonably short timescale .",
    "the irac data from the xfls has been analyzed , and a set of catalogs produced which we believe to be @xmath1% complete and @xmath2% reliable .",
    "the final bandmerged catalogs contain 103193 objects in the main field , 12224 in the verification field and 5239 in elais - n1 .",
    "flux densities of high signal - to - noise objects are accurate to about 10% , and the systematic uncertainty in the absolute flux density scale is @xmath6% .",
    "positional accuracy is @xmath25 for high signal - to - noise objects and @xmath26 at the flux density limits of the catalogs .",
    "we have successfully extracted sources at source densities as high as 100000 deg@xmath7 in our deepest channel 1 and 2 data , though there are indications that we are approaching the confusion limit at these high source densities , in agreement with fazio et al .",

    "the mosaics and catalogs will be made available both through the _",
    "science archive and the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) .",
    "we thank the other members of the irac instrument / instrument support team , in particular sean carey , for helpful discussions , and dan stern and lexi moustakas for making their software available .",
