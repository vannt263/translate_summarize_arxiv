    "this article is a continuation of our paper @xcite where we suggested an optimal fluctuation method to study exponentially rare fluctuations in weakly disordered conductors .",
    "the quantity of interest was expressed using the super - matrix nonlinear @xmath0-model @xcite , and the resulting functional integral was evaluated by the saddle point method . in this way we obtained an intermediate asymptote of conductance time dispersion in one- and two- dimensional metals .",
    "it was , however , pointed out that this method has only a limited scope of validity , e.g. , it fails to describe satisfactorily three - dimensional conductors .",
    "the failure occurs when the super - matrix corresponding to the optimal fluctuation changes rapidly over the mean free path @xmath4 .",
    "then the diffusion approximation breaks down and the use of the nonlinear @xmath0-model @xcite can no longer be justified .    in this article",
    "we treat the problem using the recently proposed ballistic @xmath0-model @xcite : the generalisation of the standard one that correctly accounts for large gradients . to be specific",
    ", we consider the long time asymptote of conductance dispersion . if a voltage @xmath5 is applied to a sample , the current through it is given by the ohm law @xmath6 and we are interested in the behaviour of the conductance @xmath1 in the long time limit .",
    "we first discuss this problem under conditions when the diffusion approximation is valid .",
    "the super - matrix theory is defined by the the partition function ( see @xcite and @xcite for review ) : @xmath7 where the functional integral over super - matrices @xmath8 is subjected to the constraint @xmath9 the expression for the averaged conductance @xmath1 looks as follows @xmath10 in eqs .",
    "( [ efet ] ) , ( [ g ] ) @xmath11 is the density of states , @xmath12 is diffusion coefficient and @xmath13 is the mean free time .",
    "the strategy suggested in ref @xcite consists in studying the condition of the extremum of the free energy @xmath14 in eq .",

    "long time retardation in electric response @xmath1 is caused by relatively improbable quasi - localised states that are weakly coupled to the bulk electrodes and have life time of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "since the mean square of the wave function @xmath22 is connected to the super - matrix @xmath21 via @xmath23 the self - consistency condition ( [ self - cons - diffusive ] ) can be regarded as a relation between the life - time of a quasi - stationary state and its wave function .",
    "the super - matrix @xmath8 is fixed at the boundary of the sample ( see eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) ) , so , to satisfy the self - consistency condition  ( [ self - cons - diffusive ] ) @xmath24 must grow towards the middle of the sample .",
    "the gradients of the @xmath8-matrix increase simultaneously with the delay time @xmath20 . since theory  ( [ efet ] ) correctly accounts only for the lowest term in @xmath25 , it can not be used for sufficiently long times @xmath20 .",
    "the importance of high gradients for long time asymptotes and tails of distribution functions was first announced by altshuler , kravtsov and lerner ( akl ) @xcite , who found the growth of the corresponding invariant charges under renormalization group flow .",
    "the optimal fluctuation method has been used recently by falko and efetov @xcite and by mirlin @xcite , who studied the influence of the nearly localised states on the distribution of wave function amplitudes @xcite and local density of states @xcite .",
    "these authors found that the gradients of @xmath8 become large near the centre of the sample and , therefore , the @xmath0-model description breaks down .    to treat consistently this problem , along with the others where ballistic motion of electrons is essential , we suggested a new version of the nonlinear @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "this theory operates with a super - matrix distribution function @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the unit vector of the electron momentum direction ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it effectively accounts for the infinite series in @xmath29 of which only the leading term is kept in the action  ( [ efet ] ) , and , therefore , correctly describes fluctuations of the super - matrix @xmath8 with wave vectors @xmath30 .",
    "the theory is still restricted , however , to the region of validity of semi - classical approximation .",
    "the condition of extremum for the new action is related to the kinetic equation in the same manner as eq .",
    "( [ us ] ) is related to the diffusion equation .",
    "we solve the kinetic equation for one- two- and three - dimensional geometries and obtain very long time asymptotes of conductance .",
    "the results are summarised in table [ table - summary ] . the exponential decay law for times",
    "@xmath31 can be obtained analysing the time dependence of weak localisation corrections .",
    "the `` ballistic '' part of the long time asymptote at @xmath32 was first studied by akl who used the frequency representation and expanded the conductance @xmath33 in powers of @xmath19 .",
    "they estimated the growth rate of coefficients in this expansion and pointed out the importance of high gradients .",
    "unfortunately , the fourier transformation to @xmath20-representation in two - dimensions was carried out with insufficient precision ( see @xcite for discussion ) and the factor @xmath34 was lost under the sign of @xmath35 .",
    "the akl approach also failed to predict the existence of intermediate asymptote at @xmath36 which was discovered by the authors @xcite using the optimal fluctuations method for the diffusive @xmath0-model .",
    "we found the region of validity for this intermediate asymptote and obtained some estimates for even longer times .",
    "these estimates were recently improved by mirlin  @xcite who imposed somewhat arbitrary effective boundary conditions on the super - matrix @xmath8 at the point where the diffusion approximation breaks down .",
    "the value of the action turned out to be rather insensitive to the exact form of these boundary conditions which enabled mirlin to rederive the akl result in 2d and obtain @xmath37 asymptote in 3d , although without the value of the coefficient @xmath38 in the exponent .",
    "the full ballistic treatment presented in this article gives the coefficient in the exponent for 3d ; confirms the akl result in 2d ; and discovers a new regime in the case of a thick wire .",
    "we have also found a restriction on the validity of ballistic treatment .",
    "it turns out , that at ultra - long delay times the super - matrix distribution function depends strongly on the direction @xmath27 of the momentum developing sharp features with characteristic width @xmath39 . at times @xmath40",
    "this width becomes comparable with the diffraction angle @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a typical size . at longer times",
    "the diffraction effects become important and the ballistic treatment is no longer valid .",
    "the values of times @xmath43 are presented in table  [ table - summary ] .",
    "apart from derivation of these results from the first principles the paper describes the optimal fluctuation of random potential in a strictly one - dimensional wire that traps an electron for time @xmath20 .",

    "the material is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we present physical motivations behind the ballistic @xmath0-model , find its condition of extremum ; and show how the ballistic description transforms into the diffusive one when the gradients are small .",
