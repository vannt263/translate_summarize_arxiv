    "reverberation mapping , observing the degree and nature of the correlation between continuum and emission line flux variations , is one of the major tools for studying the distribution and kinematics of the gas in the broad line region ( blr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; see reviews by peterson 1993 and by netzer & peterson 1997 ) .",
    "about 17 low luminosity agn ( seyfert  1 galaxies ) have been successfully monitored and produce statistically meaningful results ( see wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "best studied among these is the seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc  5548 , which was monitored from the ground for over eight years , and from space for several long periods ( peterson et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "several other seyfert  1s were observed for periods of order 1 year or less , and nine seyfert 1s were studied over a period of eight years ( peterson et al .",
    "the measured time lags between the emission lines and the continuum light curves in these objects can be interpreted in terms of the delayed response of a spatially - extended blr to a variable , compact source of ionizing radiation .",
    "while the observations do not uniquely determine the geometry of the blr , they give its typical size which , for seyfert  1 galaxies , is of the order of light - days to several light - weeks ( @xmath4@xmath5 cm ) .",
    "recent studies have shown that the time lags determined in ngc 5548 for different observing seasons correlate with the seasonal luminosity of the object ( peterson et al .",
    "1999 ) , and have presented evidence for keplerian motions of the blr gas ( peterson & wandel 1999 ) .    while seyfert  1 galaxies have been studied successfully using reverberation mapping , few similar studies of the more luminous agn  the quasars ",
    "have been presented .",
    "those that have been published have been limited in their success at determining the properties of the quasar blrs .",
    "past attempts to monitor quasars spectrophotometrically have generally suffered from temporal sampling and/or flux calibrations that are not sufficient for the determination of the blr size .",
    "zheng and collaborators ( zheng & burbidge 1986 , zheng et al",
    ". 1987 , and zheng 1988 ) reported results of a monitoring program executed on 30 quasars for several years , with a sampling interval of about one year .",
    "they found the emission - line flux to change in response to the continuum changes , but because of the limited time resolution , only an upper limit of about one light - year for the blr size could be deduced .",
    "several other groups ( prez , penston , & moles 1989 , korista 1991 , jackson et al .",
    "1992 , and erkens et al .",
    "1995 ) observed samples of quasars for approximately one year sampled with monthly observations .",
    "each of these groups reported line variations on time scales of a few months , but because of the short duration of these programs the data were insufficient for more specific conclusions .",
    "wisotzki et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) monitored the gravitationally lensed quasar he1104@xmath61805 for five years .",
    "although the quasar continuum varied considerably , the emission line fluxes appeared to remain constant .",
    "researchers have also attempted to use spectra obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ and reverberation mapping techniques to study agn . in particular , several studies ( gondhalekar et al . 1986 , gondhalekar 1990 , sitko 1990 , obrien & gondhalekar 1991 , and koratkar et al . 1998 ) deduced blr sizes of 0.012 light - years for agn . however , these results are controversial due to insufficient sampling and/or uncertainty regarding the absolute flux calibrations of the iue observations ( e.g. , bohlin & grillmair 1988a , 1988b ) .",
    "even the quasar best studied by iue , 3c273 , has yielded disputed results when different researchers have analyzed similar iue data sets .",
    "both obrien & harries ( 1991 ) and koratkar & gaskell ( 1991a ) found a measurable and similar lag between continuum and blr variations , while ulrich , courvoisier , & wamsteker ( 1993 ) argue that the line variations reported in the earlier studies were only marginally significant .",
    "thus , even in the the best - studied case , past results have proven controversial .    to obtain more definite results on the blr size in quasars , we began monitoring a well - defined sub - sample of 28 quasars from the palomar - green ( pg ) sample ( schmidt & green 1983 ) in 1991 march at the wise and steward observatories . results from the first 1.5 years were presented in maoz et al .",
    "( 1994 ; paper  i ) where it was shown that most quasars underwent continuum variations ( at 4800   rest wavelength ) with amplitudes of 10%    70% .",
    "balmer - line variability , correlated with the continuum variations , was detected in several objects .",
    "the preliminary data showed that the typical response time of the emission lines is @xmath76 months .",
    "reverberation mapping of such objects therefore requires several years , with sampling intervals of less than a few months .",
    "further results , based on four years of monitoring two quasars from our sample , pg0804 + 761 and pg0953 + 414 , were presented in kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996a ; paper",
    "the measured time lags between the balmer lines and the continuum variations of the quasars suggested that the blr size grows roughly as the square root of the luminosity of the nucleus .",
    "wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) confirmed this result using a larger sample of agn .    during the period of our spectrophotometric project we also monitored several quasar samples photometrically in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands .",
    "the broad - band results for radio- and optically - selected samples were presented in netzer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and giveon et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter paper iii ) , respectively .",
    "the optical sample in paper iii consists of 42 pg quasars , including all 28 objects discussed in the present paper .",
    "the present paper presents final results from 7.5 years of spectroscopic monitoring of our sample . in ",
    "2 we describe the sample , observations , data reduction , and present the light curves . in ",
    "3 we perform a time series analysis to determine the response time of the emission - line flux to continuum variations .",
    "we estimate the blr size , continuum luminosity , and central mass for each quasar in   4 , and in   5 we discuss the relations among these properties .",
    "the sample , observing technique , and the reduction procedure , are described in detail in papers  i ,  ii ,  &  iii . for the sake of completeness , we briefly repeat them here , with emphasis on the few procedures which , in the final reduction , were modified with respect to previous descriptions .",
    "the sample consists of 28 pg quasars .",
    "objects with a northern declination , @xmath10 mag ( based on the magnitudes given in schmidt & green 1983 ) , redshift @xmath11 , and a bright comparison star within @xmath12 of the quasar , were selected .",

    ", we use two methods for correlating the line and continuum light curves .",
    "the first method is the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ) of gaskell & sparke ( 1986 ) and gaskell & peterson ( 1987 ) , as implemented by white & peterson ( 1994 ; see also a review by gaskell 1994 ) .",
    "the second method is the @xmath55-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) of alexander ( 1997 ) which is an improvement on the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) .",

    "the two independent methods are in excellent agreement for these data and we will use only the iccf results in the following analyses .    the uncertainties in the cross correlation lag determination can be estimated using the model - independent fr / rss monte carlo method described by peterson et al .",
    "( 1998b ) . in this method ,",
    "each monte carlo simulation is composed of two parts : the first is a `` random subset selection '' ( rss ) procedure which consists of randomly drawing , with replacement , from a light curve of @xmath45 points a new sample of @xmath45 points .",
    "after the @xmath45 points are selected , the redundant selections are removed from the sample such that the temporal order of the remaining points is preserved .",
    "this procedure reduces the number of points in each light curve by a factor of @xmath56 and accounts for the effect that individual data points have on the cross - correlation .",
    "the second part is `` flux randomization '' ( fr ) in which the observed fluxes are altered by random gaussian deviates scaled to the uncertainty ascribed to each point .",
    "this procedure simulates the effect of measurement uncertainties .",
    "peterson et al . ( 1998b ) demonstrate that under a wide variety of realistic conditions , the combined fr / rss procedure yields conservative uncertainties compared to the true situation .",

    "our analysis is similar to that of wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the few significant differences are noted below .",
    "we apply below linear regression analysis to the data . unless otherwise noted , the method is the one described by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which is based on an iterative process to minimize @xmath281 , taking into account the uncertainties in both coordinates .",
    "in some of our data , the uncertainties are asymmetric ( e.g. , as a result of the fr / rss method and the use of the ccpd ) , and since the fitting method does not account for this , we use the mean of the positive and negative uncertainty estimates in a given coordinate for each data point .",
    "we find that similar results are obtained when using the pearson linear correlation and the spearman rank - order correlation .",
    "we present below only pearson coefficients .",
    "-1,9 in    -0.8 in      caution must be exercised when using time lags to estimate blr sizes because there are various assumptions and complications involved :    1 .",
    "the ccf is sensitive to the characteristics of the continuum variation , since it is a convolution of the transfer function and the continuum autocorrelation function ( penston 1991 ; peterson 1993 ) .",
    "hence , there is a dependence of the peak and centroid of the ccf on the nature of the continuum variability .",
    "an illustration of this dependence is given by netzer & maoz ( 1990 ) .",
    "a real change in blr size and geometry , over the 7 year period , is not out of the question . using the time - lags measured here , and the observed fwhms",
    ", we deduce a dynamical ( crossing ) time of the order of 30 years for the more luminous objects and about a year for the lowest luminosity seyfert galaxies .",
    "the measured time lag can be affected by the nonlinear response of some emission - line intensities to continuum variations .",
    "nonlinear responses are suggested by various studies ( obrien , goad , & gondhalekar , 1995 ; shields , ferland , & peterson , 1995 ) and discussed by kaspi & netzer ( 1999 ) .",
    "4 .   the ionizing continuum variations may behave differently from the observed optical continuum .",
    "due to anisotropic continuum emission , the emission line gas may be illuminated by an ionizing continuum that is poorly represented by the observed optical continuum ( e.g. netzer 1987 ) . furthermore , variable beaming or obscuration may be different along the different lines of sight from the continuum source to the observer and to the gas .",
    "most studies show the continuum varies in phase with little or no time delay ( albeit , with smaller amplitude at longer wavelengths ) over a wide wavelength range .",
    "there are , however , some exceptions ( e.g. , peterson et al . 1998b ) and it is clear that a full understanding of the continuum emission processes is yet to be obtained .",
    "an extreme example is shown by nandra et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found that the x - ray and uv continuum are not strongly correlated at zero time lag in ngc 7469 , with some x - ray emission peaks lagging behind the uv peaks by @xmath14 days .",

    "5 .   for a given object ,",
    "different lines from different ions have different time lags .",
    "thus , considering the entire sample , the same emission lines should be used in all objects .",
    "balmer lines are useful since their lag has been measured in most agn where reverberation mapping has been attempted . however , as argued by kaspi & netzer ( 1999 ) , the theoretical modeling of these lines is very uncertain and they are useful mostly because they provide a uniform base for comparing low luminosity seyferts with high luminosity quasars .",
    ".   there may be flux contributions by other emission lines blended with the balmer lines .",
    "these emission lines may have a different time lag and affect the measured emission line lag .",
    "an example of this potential situation is the variable feii emission lines near .",
    "a possible manifestation of some of these difficulties is the fact that for some objects , different monitoring campaigns result in different time lags .",
    "the effect was first noted in the  time lags found by peterson et al .",
    "( 1991 ; @xmath17 days ) and netzer et al .",

    "bearing in mind the above points , we convert the time lags ( deduced from the iccf centroid , @xmath277 from table  [ tccfs ] ) of the balmer emission lines directly into blr sizes ( hereafter ) after applying a cosmological @xmath282 factor .",

    "we have found the results to be very similar to those obtained by using the monochromatic luminosity .",
    "we have also examined the consequences of using the  luminosity ( rather than the optical luminosity ) to represent the ionizing luminosity of each agn . here",
    "too , we have found the results presented below to be mostly unchanged by this choice .",

    "gravitationally dominated motions of the blr clouds ( @xmath430 ) .",
    "this assumption is presented in gaskell ( 1988 ) for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151 and is also discussed and justified by wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and peterson & wandel ( 1999 ) for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5548 ( though see gaskell 1996 for a more general approach ) .",
    "there are , however , several complications regarding the velocity field .",
    "although it is generally believed that the line widths represent a keplerian velocity , it is not clear how to convert the observed profile into a velocity measure , since the observed profiles are different from the ones expected from simple keplerian orbits of arbitrary inclinations . in the absence of such information ,",
    "it is common to use the rest - frame fwhm of the emission line .",
    "because the broad emission lines of agn are composed of a narrow component superposed on a broader components , a unique fwhm determination is not straightforward . in particular , deblending the components is complicated since the line profiles can not be represented by simple analytical functions . also , the line profiles and widths are variable as is evident , for example , in gilbert et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and from the spectra obtained in this study .",
    "these variations can be due to a real change in the blr velocity field , or other reasons , such as blending with weak lines , or observational effects ( e.g. , inaccurate wavelength calibration , or changes in the seeing ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    we use two different methods to estimate a typical velocity . in the first method",
    ", for each quasar we measure the fwhm of each line in all the spectra and calculate the mean fwhm , @xmath431(mean ) , and its uncertainty ( rms ) . this empirical way of estimating the scatter accounts for all the uncertainties involved , such as spectral resolution , pixelation of the line profile , and uncertainties in continuum determination .",
    "the values are listed in table  [ tccfs ] , column ( 7 ) .    the second method , proposed by peterson et al . ( 1998a ) , uses the rms spectrum to compute the fwhm of the lines . in principle , constant features in the mean spectrum ( such as narrow forbidden emission lines , narrow components of the permitted emission lines , galactic absorptions , and constant continuum and broad - line features ) are excluded in this method .",
    "the fwhm measures only the part of the line that varied and thus corresponds to the  measured from the reverberation mapping . for the rms spectrum of each object",
    "we have listed the emission lines fwhm , @xmath431(rms ) , in column ( 8) of table  [ tccfs ] .",
    "there is no simple way to determine the uncertainty of @xmath431(rms ) , and instead we have used the relative uncertainty in @xmath431(mean ) .    like",
    "the time lags derived using  and , the fwhm of all lines for a given object are consistent with each other .",
    "thus , for the pg quasars we use the average fwhm of  and . for the seyfert 1 galaxies we have used the mean and rms fwhm quoted in wandel et al .",
    "the fwhm from the rms spectrum versus the mean fwhm from all spectra is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ffvsf ] .",
    "we find the correlation to be highly significant with correlation coefficient of 0.888 .",
    "a linear fit gives the relation @xmath432 which is plotted as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ ffvsf ] .",
    "the two velocity estimates are similar and peterson et al.s ( 1998a ) preference for the fwhm determined from the rms spectra is not empirically justified . however , in the subsequent analysis we will use both estimates of the broad - line fwhm for each object .    to determine @xmath433 we correct @xmath431 by a factor of @xmath434 , to account for velocities in three dimensions and for using half of the fwhm .",
    "the virial `` reverberation '' mass is then : @xmath435 the results of this calculation are listed in columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of table  [ trlm ] for @xmath431(mean ) and @xmath431(rms ) , respectively .",
    "the luminosity relation is presented in fig .  [ frvsl ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.827 , and its significance level is 1.7@xmath436 . a linear fit to the points gives @xmath437 ( solid line plotted in fig .",
    "[ frvsl ] ) .",
    "considering the seyfert nuclei ( @xmath438(5100 )@xmath439 ) , or the pg quasars alone , we find only marginally significant correlations , probably because of the narrow luminosity ranges .",
    "a significant correlation emerges only when using the whole luminosity range .",
    "the present result is remarkable for two reasons .",
    "first , earlier studies of this kind found a smaller power - law index in the blr size ",
    "agn luminosity relation ( closer to 0.5 , e.g. , koratkar & gaskell 1991b ; wandel et  al .",
    "a line with this slope was fit to the data and is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ frvsl ] .",
    "our result using the combined sample is not consistent with previous results .",
    "second , under the assumptions that the shape of the ionizing continuum in agn is independent of @xmath440 , and that all agn are characterized by the same ionization parameter and blr density ( as suggested by the similar line ratios in low- and high - luminosity sources ) , one expects @xmath441 .",
    "the theoretical prediction is based on the assumption that the gas distribution , and hence the mean blr size , scales with the strength of the radiation field .",
    "our present result suggests that those assumptions should be re - examined .",
    "this is also implied from recent models ( e.g. , kaspi & netzer 1999 and references therein ) which show a wide distribution of properties ( such as blr density , column density , and ionization parameter ) across the blr of a single active nucleus .",
    "therefore , a range of properties may also exist among different agn , and the above assumptions of uniform ionization parameter and blr density for all agn is likely incorrect . if an effective ionization parameter can be defined , our result suggests that it may be a decreasing function of luminosity .",
    "= 8.5 cm      our sample allows us to to re - address the issue of the velocity  luminosity relation in agn .",
    "shuder ( 1984 ) noted that the fwhm of the balmer lines increases with luminosity for a sample of 25 agn .",
    "wandel & yahil ( 1985 ) found a correlation coefficient of 0.5 between the  full width at zero intensity ( fw0i ) and the 4000  continuum luminosity for a literature compilation of 94 agn .",
    "joly et al .",
    "( 1985 ; and references therein ) also reported a weak correlation between the fw0i of  and the optical luminosity in a similar collection of objects .",
    "boroson & green ( 1992 ) note the fw0i of  is quite sensitive to noise and depends strongly on the quality of the feii subtraction .",
    "these authors found an anticorrelation coefficient of @xmath60.275 between the  fwhm and absolute @xmath442 magnitude , significant at the 99% confidence level , in a sample of 87 pg quasars . in a recent work stirpe , robinson , & axon ( 1999 ) measured  velocities for 126 agn and found them to weakly correlate with the luminosity .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in addressing the issue of the velocity  luminosity relation we note that our sample is _ not _ complete , especially with the inclusion of the heterogeneous seyfert sample .",
    "the results must therefore be treated with caution .",
    "the fwhms from the mean spectrum are plotted against the luminosity in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ ffvsllog ] .",
    "there is no significant correlation between the variables .",
    "however , if we omit the data point for the narrow line seyfert  1 , ngc  4051 , which clearly deviates from the other points and highly influences the fit , we do obtain a marginally significant correlation .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath60.386 , and its significance level is 2.7@xmath443 .",
    "a linear fit gives @xmath444 fwhms from the rms spectrum versus luminosity are plotted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ ffvsllog ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath60.540 has a significance level of 1.2@xmath445 and the best linear fit to the data is @xmath446 thus , we find significant anticorrelations , in our incomplete sample , between the fwhm of the balmer lines and the luminosity of the objects such that @xmath447 .",
    "our result indicates a stronger anticorrelation coefficient when @xmath448 is used .",
    "while the above studies used only one epoch for each quasar in their measurements , our study uses the means of the luminosities and velocities for each object over 7.5 years , and averages both  and .",
    "the pg quasars @xmath431 found in this study agrees with the ones found by boroson & green s ( 1992 ) to within @xmath110% , except for two objects ( pg1351 and pg1704 ) for which we measure significantly narrower lines . if we exclude those two objects , the anticorrelation becomes weaker and its significance decreases . as the correlation we find is opposite to those found by previous studies , the issue of the velocity  luminosity relation needs further investigation , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our two velocity estimates produce two mass estimates for each object ( see table  [ trlm ] and   [ secmass ] ) .",
    "our mass estimates based on the determination of the fwhm from the mean spectra are plotted versus luminosity in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fmvsl ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient between these two parameters is 0.646 and has a significance level of 3.7@xmath449 .",
    "a linear fit gives @xmath450 and is plotted as a solid line in the diagram .",
    "the mass estimates based on the determination of the fwhm measured from the rms spectra are plotted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fmvsl ] .",
    "we find correlation coefficient of 0.473 with a significance level of 4.7@xmath451 .",
    "a linear fit to this relation gives @xmath452 and is also plotted as a solid line .",
    "the results of the above two methods are not consistent .",
    "moreover , while it is arguable that using the rms spectra to determine @xmath433 is a better method ( see   [ secmass ] ) , the mass  luminosity correlation based on this measure is less significant .",
    "this can perhaps be attributed to the fact that the line fluxes in the rms spectra are weaker and hence the uncertainty in the corresponding fwhm larger .",
    "l relation does not agree with the one found by koratkar & gaskell ( 1991b ) of @xmath453 , nor does it agree with the one found by wandel et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) of @xmath454",
    ". however , when wandel et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) use an unweighted linear fit they find a slope of 0.54 which is in good agreement with our result . we have used a linear regression analysis which takes into account the uncertainties in both coordinates ( see   [ sml ] ) .",
    "the fact that the scatter in the mass  luminosity relation is larger than that of the size  luminosity and velocity  luminosity relations may indicate that luminosity , rather than mass , is the variable that mainly determines the blr size .",
    "in fact , from the individual size and velocity relations we expect : @xmath455 , i.e. , a weak dependence of mass on luminosity , with all agn having similar masses . in practice , we have found a somewhat stronger dependence , @xmath456 , but with a large scatter .",
    "l relation can be expressed in terms of the eddington luminosity , @xmath457 . roughly estimating the bolometric luminosity as @xmath458(5100 ) , we obtain an eddington ratio of @xmath459 the eddington limit , based on this rough estimate for @xmath460 , is plotted as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fmvsl ] .",
    "some of the quasars in our sample appear to be approximately at or beyond the eddington limit . according to fig .",
    "[ fmvsl ] , the eddington limit traces an envelope in the mass  luminosity plane ( if we ignore the two lower right hand points , pg1700 and pg1704 , which have very large errors ) .",
    "this depends , somewhat , on the factor chosen to estimate the bolometric correction , i.e. the rather uncertain slope of the unobserved uv continuum .",
    "however , if our chosen bolometric correction is realistic , we may be seeing a direct indication that agn energy is generated by gas accretion .",
    "wandel ( 1999 ) reviews three classes of agn mass estimation methods . while the x - ray variability method ( using the shortest time scale for global luminosity variations as the light travel time across the schwarzschild radius ) and the accretion disk modeling method ( deriving an accretion disk model that best fits the observed agn continuum ) suggest that the eddington ratio increases with luminosity , wandel ( 1999 ) notes that the kinematic methods ( such as reverberation mapping ) have yet to show a similar trend .",
    "our reverberation mapping result ( equation  [ eqeddr ] ) indicates for the first time that the eddington ratio increases with luminosity .",
    "models that suggest the bulk of the luminosity is due to energy release via mechanisms which radiate up to a set fraction of the eddington luminosity are not consistent with the derived mass  luminosity relation .",
    "one such model is a geometrically thin , optically thick , accretion disk that requires @xmath461 to be self - consistent ( laor & netzer 1989 ) .",
    "our finding suggests that the mass accretion rate grows with luminosity much faster than the central mass , which would mean very different disk properties in low- and high - luminosity sources .",
    "our luminosity determination is based on the monochromatic flux at 5100  . in the thin disk model ,",
    "this monochromatic flux may represents a different fraction of the object s bolometric luminosity in agn of different masses .",
    "thus , it is not clear that the thin accretion disk model can be ruled out by the new results .",
    "spectrophotometric monitoring of a large , optically - selected quasar sample has shown clear correlations and well - defined time lags between the optical continuum and the balmer - line light curves .",
    "while the seyfert  1 galaxies that have been studied in this manner all have optical luminosities @xmath462  1.5@xmath4210@xmath463  ergs  s@xmath424 , the new sample allows us to measure time lags in agn with luminosities up to @xmath464  ergs  s@xmath424 .",
    "our work increases the available luminosity range for studying the size ",
    "luminosity relations in agn by two orders of magnitude and doubles the number of objects suitable for these studies .",
    "we have combined our results for 17 quasars with data for 17 seyfert  1 galaxies having reliable time lag measurements , and derived uniform estimates of blr size , central masses , and luminosities for the combined sample .",
    "our main finding is that the blr size scales with the 5100  luminosity as @xmath465 .",
    "this is significantly different from wandel et al.s ( 1999 ) analysis and is also in contradiction with simple theoretical expectations , both suggesting @xmath466 .",
    "we have also found that the velocity field of the blr scales inversely with the luminosity , @xmath467 . combining the measured  with the observed fwhms",
    ", we have obtained a mass  luminosity relation for agn , @xmath468 , which , however , has a large intrinsic scatter .",
    "l correlations are based on two different estimates ( mean and rms ) of the fwhm of the balmer lines and are not consistent with each other , despite the fact that the two measured values for the fwhm are generally consistent . empirically , at least , it is not obvious which method of fwhm measurement is preferable .",
    "our results show the usefulness of long - term monitoring of high - luminosity agn .",
    "there is a need to expand the luminosity range to include the highest luminosity quasars and this will require some 510 years of observations .",
    "follow - up studies are also needed for some of the results obtained here , such as better determinations of the gas distribution in the blr and the exact sed of the quasars .",
