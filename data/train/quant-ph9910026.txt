    "maximally entangled quantum states , when their two halves are shared between two parties , are a uniquely valuable resource for various information - processing tasks . used in conjunction with a quantum communications channel , they can increase the classical data carrying capacity of that channel , in some cases by an arbitrarily large factor@xcite .",
    "possession of maximally entangled states can ensure perfect privacy of communication between the two parties by the use of quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "these states can facilitate the rapid performance of certain forms of distributed computations@xcite .",
    "of course , maximally entangled states are the key resource in quantum teleportation@xcite . on the other hand , the surreptitious establishment of entanglement between two parties can thwart the establishment of trust between parties via bit commitment@xcite .",
    "how can two parties come into the possession of a shared maximally entangled state ?",
    "if the storage and transportation of quantum particles were perfect , then the state could have been synthesized in some laboratory long in the past and given to alice and bob ( our personified parties ) for storage until needed . in practice no such perfect infrastructure exists .",
    "since the most interesting scenarios for the use of quantum entanglement are in cases where alice and bob are remote from one another , we will consider the long - distance transportation of quantum states needed to establish the shared entanglement to be difficult and imperfect , while the local processing of quantum information ( unitary transformations , measurement ) we will assume , for the sake of analysis , to be essentially perfect .    under these assumptions , when we wish to assess whether a given physical setup is or is not useful for entanglement assisted information processing , our analysis focuses on the mixed quantum state , @xmath3 , in the hands of alice and bob after the difficult transportation step .",
    "we enquire whether @xmath4 can be transformed , by _",
    "lq+cc operations _ , to a supply of maximally entangled states . here",
    "the @xmath5 notation indicates that @xmath6 copies of the state @xmath3 are available , and we will be concerned with asymptotic results as @xmath6 is taken to infinity .",
    "lq+cc operations ( sometimes called locc in the literature ) are obtained by any arbitrary sequence of _ local _ quantum operations ( appending ancillae , performing unitary operations , discarding ancillae ) supplemented by _ classical communication _ between alice and bob .",
    "an interesting fact about this possibility for the _ distillation _ of entanglement is that it is neither rare nor ubiquitous ; a finite fraction of the set of all possible bipartite mixed states @xmath3 can be successfully distilled@xcite , and a finite fraction cannot@xcite .",
    "much work has been focussed on whether @xmath3 falls into the distillable or into the undistillable class , and this paper is primarily a contribution to this classification task . before describing our new contributions , we will give a brief review of previous results on classifying states according to their distillability .",
    "multipartite density matrices @xmath3 are considered _ unentangled _ if there exists a decomposition of @xmath3 into an ensemble of pure product states ; for the bipartite case this means that we can write latexmath:[\\[\\rho=\\sum_i p_i |\\alpha_i\\rangle\\langle\\alpha_i|\\otimes    to as separable states .",
    "it is clear that separable states are never distillable .",
    "however , the converse proposition , that entangled states are always distillable , is false in general , although true for density matrices in @xmath2 and @xmath8 hilbert spaces@xcite .",
    "this became clear shortly after the introduction by peres@xcite of a computationally simple criterion for separability , the _ partial transposition _ test .",
    "the partial - transpose operation , denoted as @xmath9 when the transpose is applied to bob s hilbert space , is specified by the action @xmath10 while application of @xmath11 to alice s hilbert space will lead to identical results , we will always apply it to bob s space in this paper . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 indicate an orthonormal basis on alice s hilbert space , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 the same for bob .",
    "it is easy to show that separable states are positive under partial transpose , that is , that the matrix @xmath16 is a positive semi - definite operator , denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "( [ intronot ] ) introduces the @xmath18 notation that we will use throughout this paper . )",
    "this positivity property is abbreviated as ppt ; states for which @xmath19 are called npt states .",
    "it was soon recognized@xcite that the set of ppt density operators @xmath3 is larger than the set of unentangled states ( except in @xmath2 and @xmath8 ) ; see fig .",
    "[ pptetc ] .",
    "it was also discovered that all ppt states , even those which are inseparable , are not distillable .",
    "the existence of such states , in which entanglement is present ( since entanglement is required to synthesize the states ) but can not be rextracted in pure form , was a surprising observation , indicating the possibility of a fundamentally new form of irreversibility in physics .",
    "states having this property are said to possess _ bound entanglement_.    the introduction of the ppt / npt classification suggested a new conjecture about distillability , namely that all states with npt would possess distillable entanglement , and it is the purpose of the present paper to explore this conjecture . while no rigorous results have been obtained concerning this conjecture , we will introduce a two - parameter family of npt states for which we obtain evidence that the conjecture is false .",
    "that is , we consider it likely that the family of states we introduce below has only bound entanglement , despite being npt .",
    "we have been able to recast the question about the distillability property of the @xmath0 states , or of any npt states , as a question about the two - positivity properties of certain positive linear maps@xcite .",
    "these maps arise because there is a one - to - one correspondence between mixed states on @xmath1 and completely positive linear maps @xmath20 on @xmath21 dimensions which , when applied to half a maximally entangled state @xmath22 , produces the mixed state @xmath3 .",
    "then , the npt property is related to the map @xmath23 and its compositions @xmath24 .",
    "the open question about distillability can be posed compactly as a question concerning the mathematical properties of these maps .",
    "this approach also permits us to consider the question of whether distillability is an additive property , that is , whether the amount of distillable entanglement of @xmath25 is just the sum of the two separately .",
    "et al._@xcite have given some evidence for a kind of undistillability involving single copies of ppt bound entangled states . in the positive - map language ,",
    "the most general questions about non - additivity can be compactly framed .",
    "this shows that further developments of the theory of positive maps will be very desirable in settling some of the fundamental questions about the entanglement properties of quantum states .",
    "this paper develops in the following way : section [ canon ] introduces the canonical states @xmath0 and shows the lq+cc mapping that produces them .",
    "section [ tools ] considers the distillability of any state @xmath3 by application of the basic criterion of whether it remains entangled when projected into @xmath2 .",
    "section [ single ] considers a single copy of the @xmath0 state , establishing the @xmath0 for which there exist such projections into @xmath2",
    "[ multi ] takes up the much harder case of multiple copies , with sec .",
    "[ nulls ] proving the result that for some @xmath26 states , no entanglement remains upon projection into @xmath2 even for arbitrarily large @xmath6 .",
    "section [ twopos ] recasts the question about distillability in terms of two - positivity of linear maps isomorphic to the mixed states .",
    "the desired , but too - ambitious , program would be to assess the distillability of all npt states .",
    "we will attempt this assessment only for a specific subset of the npt states parameterized by two real numbers .",
    "this subset will , however , have a specific relation to the set of npt states , in that there is a lq+cc operation that will map the general npt state onto one in our two - parameter family .",
    "this lq+cc operation preserves the npt property .",
    "thus , if we could exhibit a protocol for the distillation of our two - parameter family , this would suffice to show that all npt states were distillable . on the contrary , our canonical two - parameter family has properties which make distillation quite hard for certain ranges of the parameters , suggesting that in fact some portion of the full set of npt states is _ not _ distillable .",
    "our canonical states , with real parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are written as @xmath29 here @xmath30 the states live in a @xmath1 hilbert space .",

    "as we will show in the next section , the state is npt in two triangular regions of parameter space ; one of these regions @xmath33 , which will not be of much interest to us ( all these states are distillable ) , lies above the straight line @xmath34 , and is defined by the inequality @xmath35 .",

    "the proof is similar in structure to the proof of the lemma in the appendix of @xcite . by definition",
    "a linear positive map @xmath445 is 2-positive if and only if , for _ all _ @xmath446 , @xmath447 we will show that we only need to consider states @xmath41 that are maximally entangled .",
    "note that any ( unnormalized ) maximally entangled state can be written as @xmath380 with @xmath448 , @xmath449 .",
    "we start with the following observation : when we apply the map @xmath378 on some maximally entangled state in @xmath450 , @xmath451 the matrix @xmath452 uniquely determines the action of the map @xmath378 on any input matrix that has support on the two dimensional space spanned by the vectors @xmath453 and @xmath454 .    for",
    "the first part of the lemma , let @xmath455 in eq .",
    "( [ defd ] ) .",
    "since @xmath452 is hermitian , we can write it in its eigendecomposition @xmath456 with the eigenvalues @xmath457 and the eigenvectors @xmath458 .",
    "each eigenstate @xmath459 can be written in a schmidt decomposition as @xmath460 with @xmath461 , and all vectors normalized .",
    "note that the states @xmath462 and @xmath463 can span a different two - dimensional subspace of @xmath464 for each @xmath72 .",
    "there exists a local filter @xmath465 @xcite from which we can obtain the state @xmath459 from the maximally entangled state @xmath466 : @xmath467 @xmath465 includes : ( 1 ) a unitary transformation from the basis @xmath468 to @xmath469 , where @xmath470 are the schmidt vectors of @xmath471 when it is written in the form @xmath472 ( taking advantage of the degeneracy of the schmidt decomposition of the maximally entangled state ) , and ( 2 ) a diagonal filter which reduces the schmidt coefficients to @xmath473 .    thus we may write @xmath452 as @xmath474 we see that since @xmath455 by assumption , we are able to write the action of the map @xmath378 on the input @xmath466 in a ` completely positive form ' with operation elements @xmath475 that depend on @xmath476 .",
    "we observed above that this input determines the action of the map uniquely on the subspace spanned by the vectors @xmath453 and @xmath454 .",
    "therefore the map acts as a completely positive map on any input that has support on a two - dimensional space .",
    "this implies that eq .",
    "( [ anystate ] ) holds for any state @xmath477 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath378 is @xmath362-positive then eq . ( [ 2posmax ] ) holds for any maximally entangled state @xmath466 .",
