    "the interplay of orbital and spin degrees of freedom with electronic interactions can produce a diverse range of chemical and physical behavior .",
    "at the few - electron level of a single molecule , understanding the resulting complexity is a traditional problem in theoretical chemistry  and a challenge because strong correlations preclude an independent particle picture . at the many - electron level of clean bulk metals , by contrast ,",
    "interactions are often rather unimportant , and the system adequately described by an essentially independent particle description .    bridging between these limits is the fascinating class of ` quantum impurity problems ' , @xcite in which an interacting and , in effect , small molecular subsystem is coupled locally to the continuum of conduction electrons in a metal .",
    "the most basic example , a classic paradigm in condensed matter science,@xcite is a single magnetic impurity embedded in a metallic host .",
    "local coulomb repulsion favors single - occupancy of the active impurity orbital , with a local moment thus forming at high temperatures due to the free spin degree of freedom .",
    "but the kondo effect plays a key role at low temperatures / energies : the impurity moment is screened dynamically by conduction electrons , which together form a many - body spin - singlet state ( the ` kondo singlet ' ) .",
    "the screening process itself can be understood in terms of a renormalization group flow , corresponding to the crossover from the local moment fixed point applicable at high temperatures , to the strong coupling fixed point describing the kondo singlet ground state.@xcite importantly , physical properties exhibit universality in terms of the crossover temperature scale , @xmath0 .    the kondo effect associated with screening of a single magnetic impurity has been observed experimentally in many metals.@xcite in semi - metallic systems by contrast , where the host density of states vanishes at the fermi level , it is well known that kondo physics can be suppressed , and that such systems also support degenerate local moment ground states.@xcite local quantum phase transitions between kondo screened phases and local moment phases have thus attracted much interest and have been studied in detail ; being sought for example in softgapped systems such as graphene,@xcite d - wave superconductors@xcite and surfaces of 3d topological insulators.@xcite    the situation is unsurprisingly richer when several impurities are present .",
    "already in the case of two impurities , the resulting behavior can be markedly different.@xcite if the impurities are spatially well separated , each is essentially screened independently by the kondo effect .",
    "but an effective exchange interaction ( ` rkky ' ) can arise and dominate when two impurities are brought closer , with a resulting crossover to _ local _ interimpurity spin - singlet formation@xcite ( indeed for strictly independent screening channels , the crossover is sharpened to a true transition@xcite ) .",
    "multi - impurity systems , and even small molecules deposited on metallic surfaces , exhibit more complex phenomena due to competition between local interactions and the kondo effect.@xcite in this paper we consider a cluster of three impurities , which exhibits the frustrating effects of competing ground states . frustration and degenerate ground states at level crossings are of course an important general feature of many complex molecular systems familiar in chemistry . here",
    "we examine the interplay between frustration and the kondo effect in one of its simplest realizations , to obtain a detailed understanding of the underlying physical behavior .",
    "real three - impurity systems , such as cr clusters on clean au(111 ) surfaces or co clusters on cu(100 ) , have been studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite but since the impurities couple to different surface sites of the host , a realistic theoretical model maps irreducibly to a three - channel problem,@xcite whose properties depend quite sensitively on details of the particular experimental realization . more general aspects of the three impurity problem can however be accessed in triple quantum dot devices,@xcite where the metallic leads to which the dots are tunnel - coupled provide the conduction electrons .",
    "the kondo effect has been observed in single semiconductor quantum dots coupled to metallic leads,@xcite which are often referred to as ` artificial atoms'.@xcite by the same token , coupled dot devices behave as highly tunable ` artificial molecules'.@xcite the primary experimental probe in all cases is of course the conductance , obtained by driving a steady current through the lead - coupled quantum dot system .",

    "zero - bias conductance through the device in this case is maximally enhanced at low temperatures due to the kondo effect .",
    "three distinct screening mechanisms are uncovered , depending on the relative strength of interdot tunnel - couplings , which have characteristic universal signatures in physical quantities .",

    "the first step@xcite is to divide the conduction electron dos into intervals whose width decreases exponentially ( the points separating intervals are @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 )",
