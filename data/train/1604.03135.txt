    "@xcite first discovered the hot neptune gl 581 b orbiting this star , while @xcite identified a second short - period planet , gl 581 c. the number of additional planets that orbit this star has been a matter of recent debate .",

    "@xcite also raised concerns about planet d. @xcite looked at the h@xmath4 line , a magnetic activity indicator .",
    "they found support for the existence of the three innermost planets ( b , c , and e ) , but indications that the outer planets ( d , g , and f ) are the result of stellar activity and rotation .",
    "@xcite identified a super - earth around gl 667c , with a second found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified a total of six keplerian signals at a range of periods .",

    "they also express concern that the period of the outer planet is close to the @xmath8 day stellar rotation period .",
    "these examples illustrate that stellar activity signals , which appear at the stellar rotation period and its harmonics , can mimic the effect of a planet at or near these orbital periods .",
    "the typical rotation periods of field - age dwarf stars varies by almost an order of magnitude across the lower main sequence , increasing from about @xmath9 days for early g stars @xcite , to greater than @xmath10 days for mid - to - late m dwarfs @xcite . over the same stellar mass range , the orbital period corresponding to a habitable planet decreases from approximately @xmath11 days to @xmath12 days .",
    "there thus exists a range of stellar masses where the stellar rotation and planetary habitable - zone periods overlap .",
    "this came to our team s attention in pursuit of follow - up observations of k2 - 3 , an early m dwarf with three confirmed transiting super - earths @xcite : we noted that the stellar rotation period of @xmath13 days is very close to the @xmath14 day orbital period of k2 - 3d , which is near the inner edge of the planetary habitable zone .",
    "there are several current and near - future radial velocity surveys committed to finding planets around m dwarf stars , including carmenes @xcite , hpf @xcite , and spirou @xcite .",
    "it is therefore critical that we understand how stellar rotation may impact the discovery of the potentially habitable planets around these stars . in this letter",
    ", we leverage new rotation periods of mid - to - late m dwarfs in the solar neighborhood from our recent work in @xcite to investigate this problem for stars across the m spectral class .",
    "to assess stellar rotation across the main sequence , we compile literature measurements for the rotation periods of field stars , using data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the latter supplies most of the rotation period measurements for mid and late m dwarfs , and results from our analysis of photometry from the mearth - north transit survey @xcite .",
    "the rotation periods from @xcite and @xcite also come from broadband optical or red - optical photometry . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite measure periodicities in chromospheric activity features .",

    "these @xmath17 are adopted from the  input catalog ( kic ; * ? ? ? * ) or , where available , from @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : hzharmonics ] shows stellar rotation period as a function of stellar mass for late - type stars in the field . given the uncertainties in the stellar parameters for the  sample , we treat these as an ensemble and",
    "plot the distribution instead of the individual measurements .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xcite analysis may be limited by s quarterly flux offsets ; the other surveys included in this compilation detected periods out to @xmath10 days or longer .",
    "figure [ fig : hzharmonics ] includes stars of a range of ages . as single stars age , they lose angular momentum and their rotation periods increase .",
    "angular momentum loss is mass dependent , with lower - mass stars taking longer to spin down , but eventually reaching longer rotation periods .",
    "the long - period envelope of the rotation period distribution is thought to represent an old field population , and the fast rotators at a given mass will eventually evolve toward these long periods days , which stand out as lying above this envelope .",
    "though intriguing , discussion is beyond the scope of this paper . ] .",
    "the envelope comprises stars of similar age to the sun and older , which was established by @xcite and @xcite for sun - like stars .",
    "we quantified this for m dwarfs by using galactic kinematics to estimate that mid m dwarfs with rotation periods around @xmath10 days are on average @xmath22 gyr old @xcite .",
    "when radial velocity variations induced by stellar rotation and activity coincide with the planetary orbital period , it can be difficult to identify the planetary signal .",
    "this stellar signal can appear not just at the rotation period itself , but at higher - order harmonics as well .",
    "@xcite tested cases where the photosphere is dominated by one or two spots and found that power appears primarily at one - half and one - third the stellar rotation period ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "thus , stars with rotation periods that are the same as , or two to three times longer than , the habitable zone are not optimal targets for radial velocity searches that aim to discover potentially habitable planets .    the habitable zone from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* using values from the erratum ) is indicated in figures [ fig : hzharmonics]-[fig : gj1132 ] .",
    "we adopt the moist greenhouse limit as the inner edge of the habitable zone and the maximum greenhouse as the outer edge of the habitable zone .",
    "we use the @xcite solar - metallicity @xmath18 gyr isochrone to calculate @xmath17 and luminosity ( @xmath23 ) at a given stellar mass .",
    "we note that the choice of stellar models as well as parameters beyond stellar mass , in particular stellar age and metallicity , affect @xmath17 and @xmath23 , and therefore also the precise location of the calculated habitable zone .    for @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath2 ,",
    "figure [ fig : hzharmonics ] shows that the orbital period of habitable - zone planets is similar to the rotation period of the typical @xmath22 gyr star .",
    "power can also appear at multiples of the stellar rotation period , so activity signatures can pose problems for habitable - zone planets even with slowly rotating early m dwarfs .",
    "this means that stellar rotation can be a confounding factor for @xmath26 .",
    "this corresponds to spectral types between m1v and m4v .",
    "we illustrate this idea by considering known m dwarf planet hosts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : planets ] ) .",

    "we select those stars with @xmath27 k , @xmath28 @xmath2 , @xmath29 @xmath30 , and a measured trigonometric parallax .",
    "we use the @xmath20mass relation from @xcite to estimate stellar masses .",

    "* from _ hipparcos _ ) , and supplement with additional sources as necessary .",
    "we adopt nir magnitudes from 2mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , requiring ` qual_flag ` = aaa ) .",
    "where 2mass magnitudes are not available , we use cit magnitudes from @xcite .",
    "we then use the @xcite relation to estimate stellar masses and the @xcite single - star relation to estimate stellar radii .",
    "the @xcite relation is based on cit magnitudes , so we convert 2mass magnitudes to the cit system using the relations from @xcite .",
    "stellar rotation periods are compiled from the literature , though many are from @xcite .",
    "we do not consider estimates from rotational broadening of spectral lines , which are subject to uncertainty in the inclination angle .",
    "these data are listed in table [ tab : planets ] .",
    "figure [ fig : planets ] shows the rotation periods of these planet hosts .",
    "gl 581 , in particular , highlights the challenge early m dwarfs pose for radial velocity surveys seeking to find habitable planets .",
    "though this star has a very long rotation period ( @xmath31 days ) , the harmonics dip into the habitable zone .",
    "this resulted in the controversy over the potentially habitable planet gl 581 d ( @xmath32 days , at about @xmath33 ) , as well as g ( @xmath34 days , between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",

    "@xcite catalog stars for which we did not detect periodic photometric modulation in the mearth data . for some of these objects , the light curves were noisy or sparse , which could have prohibited period detection .",
    "further monitoring may indicate whether these stars are good targets for radial velocity surveys .",
    "the statistical sample we identified includes the objects more likely to be of immediate interest .",
    "our statistical sample was the subset of stars for which the number of observations ( @xmath42 ) and median error ( @xmath43 ) were such that we had good sensitivity to a range of rotation periods ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) . within this sample ,",
    "we did not detect a periodic signal for @xmath46 .",

    "we infer that , on average , these stars have ages similar to the long - period sample : we generally expect them to be members of the old thin disk and to be slowly rotating .",
    "the stars in the statistical sample with no period detections are therefore also promising targets for radial velocity surveys .",
    "we have demonstrated that the habitable zone of early m dwarfs coincides with the stellar rotation period typical for older field stars ( approximately @xmath22 gyr ) . because activity signals are also expected at two and three times the frequency of the stellar rotation , the stars for which this is an issue are those with @xmath26 ( roughly m1v  m4v ) .",
    "this means that stellar activity will be an unavoidable contaminant in radial velocity surveys that are searching for habitable planets around early m dwarfs . rather than being the exception",

    "a key motivation for turning to m dwarfs is that their small stellar size enhances the signals of orbiting planets .",
    "however , m dwarfs span nearly a decade in stellar mass and radius .",
    "this means that the transit and radial velocity signatures of a planet orbiting a mid - to - late m dwarf are significantly larger than if an analogous planet orbited an early m dwarf .",
    "for example , the transit depth of the earth around the sun is @xmath51 ; for the same size planet orbiting an @xmath52 star ( m1v ) , the transit depth is @xmath53 , while for an @xmath54 star ( m5v ) , it is @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , an earth - mass planet at the inner edge of the habitable zone induces a radial velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath0 m / s if it orbits an @xmath56 star ( m1v ) , compared to @xmath57 m / s if it orbits an @xmath58 star ( m5v ) .",

    "their work indicates that the detection of oxygen in the atmosphere of a habitable , earth - sized planet is a significant time investment that will only be feasible for nearby m dwarfs with @xmath59 .",
    "this is due to the relative size of the star and the planet , and the orbital periods of planets in the habitable zone .",
    "such a measurement would be within reach only for the nearest and brightest mid - to - late m dwarfs .",
    "we have demonstrated that the confluence of these factors make mid m dwarfs ideal targets for radial velocity surveys that have the goal of discovering habitable planets whose atmospheres can be studied with the _ james webb space telescope _ and the elts . many of these targets will be discovered in the coming years by radial velocity instruments and transit surveys ( the latter of which are likely to receive radial velocity follow - up ) .",
    "early m dwarfs are tempting targets for such surveys : their relative brightness makes it easier to achieve higher signal - to - noise observations and more precise radial velocity measurements",
    ". however , stellar activity signals will be present at the same periods at which the habitable planets are found .",
    "recent debate surrounding the candidate exoplanets orbiting gl 581 , gl 667c , and gl 191 have already demonstrated the challenge of disentangling planetary reflex motion from stellar activity signals .",
