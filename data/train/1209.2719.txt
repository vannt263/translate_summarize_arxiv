    "<S> another important outcome of the effective model is that it provides hints on the finite - size effects on the spinon energies , with consequences on the spin gap and the localization length . </S>",

    "<S> asymptotically , we thus expect finite - size corrections of the form @xmath62 with @xmath63 a constant .    in order to validate this effective model , we compare it to accurate dmrg calculations of the magnetization profile in a chain with total spin @xmath64 with the effective model predictions where @xmath65 is deduced from the @xmath66  @xcite . as judged by the results of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : localization](d ) , strong deviations between dmrg calculations and the infinite size result are observed . </S>",

    "<S> the mg states remain degenerate ground - states at small enough disorder and the lowest triplet excitation above them is to create two localized spinons in each sublattice ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gap](a - b ) ) with both the minimal energy @xmath71 . as the two spinons are localized on very large clusters , the singlet and triplet gaps </S>",
    "<S> must be degenerate in the thermodynamical limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the effective model prediction for the spin gap is @xmath72 . in order to give a typical finite - size behavior , </S>",
    "<S> we show on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gap](c ) the minimum dmrg triplet gap found over an hundred of samples of chains of size @xmath73 , compared with the effective model result on the same samples . </S>",
    "<S> two main features come out . </S>",
    "<S> first , the difference between the two finite - size curves can be attributed to the variational error , already making the non - disordered spin gap @xmath74 smaller than @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> as lifshitz states correspond to large ` clean ' boxes with couplings @xmath49 , the same correction should apply to them , improving the prediction to @xmath76 ( label ` expected @xmath77 ' on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gap](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , the curved nature of the typical spin gap for @xmath73 and randomly chosen samples is due to the fact that the minimum gap discussed above is obtained for extremely rare events and can be viewed as a sort of finite - size effect since @xmath78 is not self - averaging .    </S>",
    "<S> increasing further the disorder strength , the spin gap vanishes for @xmath79 for which @xmath71 becomes negative ( @xmath80 for @xmath81 ) so that states with two or more spinons get energetically favored . </S>",
    "<S> the mg states are still eigenstates but no longer ground - states . the resulting picture shortly after the critical point is a paramagnetic phase of localized spinons , as we can neglect tiny residual magnetic couplings between spinons for a small enough density . </S>",
    "<S> this spinon density is nothing but the density of negative energy spinon states @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the magnetic susceptibility must change from zero to @xmath82 across the transition as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gap](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> dmrg calculations do confirm this picture , showing that the ground and first excited states are nearly degenerate states with localized spinons . </S>",
    "<S> within the effective model picture , the quantum phase transition from the gapped to the paramagnetic phase is located at @xmath83 and its order depends on the disorder distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a continuous transition occurs for a continuous disorder distribution while binary disorder yields a first order transition . in order to determine @xmath69 for the effective model </S>",
    "<S> , one must realize that the lifshitz argument can not be used for spinon energies close to zero  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet , we argue that the number of negative energy states is actually given by the number of negative @xmath48 which , for the box distribution , gives @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the associated critical exponent of the susceptibility is thus one . </S>",
    "<S> this argument is checked numerically on the effective model in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gap](c ) . checking this law using dmrg </S>",
    "<S> is particularly difficult as the spinon density gets very small close to the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we point out that this low spinon density picture fails at larger disorder ( large spinon density ) for two related reasons : magnetic couplings between spinons become non - negligible and the neglecting states with non - local dimers is questionable . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the spinon phase then becomes partially polarized and connected to the large - spin phase that exists away from the rmg point and that we now discuss .    </S>",
    "<S> _ random confinement localization _  moving away from the rmg point is progressively done by uncorrelating the @xmath3 and @xmath4 through the introduction of random variables @xmath85 , uncorrelated to the @xmath4 , and such that @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 $ ] is a tuning parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations @xmath89 ( @xmath90 denoting a variance ) show that the @xmath91s and @xmath92s get uncorrelated for @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath94 , we further impose @xmath95 to study the effect of the correlations only by keeping the disorder strength as for the rmg point . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , using this decoupling , the hamiltonian splits into two parts @xmath96 , where @xmath16 is a random dimerization term : @xmath97 with @xmath98 random couplings of mean - value @xmath99 . the effect of @xmath16 is to localize spinons via a random confinement mechanism that can be understood within the effective model approach . </S>",
    "<S> the associated effective hamiltonian @xmath100 in the single spinon basis takes a rather complicated form  @xcite , with a dense - matrix representation . </S>",
    "<S> still , its main effect is to induce an effective random chemical potential @xmath101 for the spinon which reads @xmath102 it is the sum of two independent random walks ( the @xmath103s on each sublattice ) constrained to have a total fixed length . </S>",
    "<S> such a potential typically has a minimum in the bulk of large chains and create a well which localizes the spinon . as for explicitly dimerized chains  @xcite , moving away from the minimum of the potential </S>",
    "<S> is locally analogous to a linear confinement . </S>",
    "<S> dmrg calculations are nicely fitted by diagonalizing the full effective hamiltonian @xmath104 matrix  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the spinon is found to be governed by the @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> if one now takes the full hamiltonian , finite - size systems display a crossover between anderson localization at very small @xmath105 and random confinement localization which dominates up to @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that the random confinement can stabilize many spinons states leading to the formation of many domains .    </S>",
    "<S> _ mg domain formation _ </S>",
    "<S>  at small @xmath105 , @xmath16 acts as a perturbation which locally lifts the degeneracy between the two mg states , as suggested qualitatively in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> clearly , mg states are no longer eigenstates since high order terms in perturbation theory put weights on long dimer states @xmath106}\\rangle } = { \\vert{{\\includegraphics[width=3.2cm , clip]{mglongexcited}}}\\rangle}$ ] with a dimer on bond @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> more than dressing the mg state , the random dimerization actually destroys the spin gap as soon as @xmath108 and @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the energy difference @xmath110}\\vert{{\\mathcal{h}}}\\vert{[2i-1,2j]}\\rangle}-e_{\\text{mg}}$ ] between @xmath106}\\rangle}$ ] and the corresponding mg state reads  @xcite @xmath111 the first term which averages to @xmath112 stems from the cost of creating two domain walls ( spinons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second term corresponds to an effective long range interaction between the two spinons and arises from @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it averages to zero but rare events can definitely bring this state to a lower energy than the mg state : in an infinitely large system , it is always possible to find a region with @xmath103s that do not compensate and such that the random interaction scales as the region size to make @xmath113 . at low disorder , regions must be large and the spinons far away so that their remaining magnetic coupling vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the spin gap is then immediately broken .    </S>",
    "<S> -dimerization term of eq .   over mg domains ( orange line ) . ]    in order to support this picture , we perform dmrg calculations for @xmath108 and do observe that , on a finite - system , the spin gap is strongly reduced by increasing @xmath105 , or by increasing @xmath70 at fixed @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we exhibit in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : finitelambda](a ) a sample with @xmath93 where four spinons are present in the ground - state and for which the spin gap is zero within numerical accuracy . to complete the description , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization profile along each domain wall is pretty well reproduced by using the local effective hamiltonian for a single spinon ( born - like approximation ) . finally , the averaged of @xmath16 in each domain , plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : finitelambda](b ) , supports the pining mechanism of the mg domains . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the spinon density with disorder is a challenging issue as it requires the minimization of the energy of several correlated domains which number is not fixed  @xcite .    at low spinon densities , </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state is a network of localized spinons which interact via their spin degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the effective magnetic couplings should range from almost zero to finite values if two spinons happen to be close . </S>",
    "<S> there is no constraint on their signs : both ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings exist , making the phase partially polarized . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly this weak disorder picture is physically connected with the strong disorder picture of rsrg .    </S>",
    "<S> _ comparison with rsrg _  it is interesting to compare these results with the rsrg method best suited to the strong disorder limit . from the rsrg equations given in the supplementary material , we notice that the degeneracy of the mg domains at the rmg point translates into an instability of the rsrg decimation . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as @xmath108 , the gap distribution in the system converges toward an invariant power - law distribution with a non - universal exponent , caracteristic of griffith phase similar to previous results  @xcite . indeed , due to frustration </S>",
    "<S> , the rsrg equations generate a few effective ferromagnetic couplings  @xcite , building up a large - spin phase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this supports a continuous phase from weak to strong disorder . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we stress that the non - crossing dimer basis is deeply related to the rsrg picture that targets the most probable dimer configuration from the coupling distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _  this work provides quantitative results on the interplay between frustration and disorder in random mg chains . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two mechanisms at play for single spinon : an unsual anderson localization mechanism , and a random confinement mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the immediate destruction of the spin gap upon putting disorder is to be contrasted with its robustness for the explicitly dimerized or spin-1 chains which have a non - degenerate ground - state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of degenerate mg states makes the system very sensitive to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the same phenomenology to play a role in other random vbs , which could be witnessed using numerical methods working in the spinon basis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , these mechanisms demonstrate how random couplings generate `` free spins '' in vbs , without vacancies or adatoms , and are thus experimentally relevant .    </S>",
