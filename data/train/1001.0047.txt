    "due to the increasing interest in ultra - fast electron dynamics considerable progress occurred recently in the theoretical description of time dependent mesoscopic transport .",
    "new methods and numerical implementations are rapidly evolving .",
    "transient currents in open nanostructures are studied with green - keldysh formalism,@xcite scattering theory,@xcite and quantum master equation.@xcite most of the results were obtained for noninteracting electrons due to the well known computational difficulties to include time - dependent coulomb effects .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the electron - electron interaction is important in such problems .",
    "an effort to incorporate it has been recently done by kurth _ et al._@xcite followed by myhnen _",
    "et al._@xcite who have described correlated time - dependent transport in a short 1d chain defined by a lattice hamiltonian .",
    "the 1d sample was connected to external leads and the current was driven by a time - dependent bias .",
    "those authors used a method based on the kadanoff - baym equation for the non - equilibrium green s function combined with the time - dependent density functional theory to include the coulomb interaction in the sample . once the green s functions were calculated _ total _",
    "average quantities of interest could be obtained , like charge density or current , both in the transitory and in the steady state .",
    "however this method does not say much about the dynamics of specific _ internal states _ of the sample system . in view of the spectroscopy of excited",
    "states@xcite it is important to have a theoretical tool for understanding separately the charging and relaxation of the ground states and excited states in mesoscopic systems in time - dependent conditions .",
    "our alternative is to use the statistical , or density operator .",
    "the complete information about the time evolution of each quantum state of the sample is captured in the reduced density operator ( rdo ) , which is the solution of the generalized master equation ( gme ) .",
    "once the rdo is defined in the fock space the inclusion of the coulomb interaction becomes a known computational problem : obtaining the many - electron states ( mes ) of the sample .",
    "the rdo matrix is then calculated in the basis of the interacting mes .",
    "let us enumerate some of the previous theoretical schemes to treat transport and electron - electron interaction with the master equation .",
    "one of the first attempts to derive a master equation for an interacting system with time - dependent perturbations belongs to langreth and nordlander for the anderson model.@xcite gurvitz and prager started from the time - dependent shrdinger equation for the mes wave functions and ended up with bloch - like rate equations for the density matrix of a quantum dot.@xcite the electronic currents were calculated in the steady state and it was shown that the coulomb interaction renormalizes the tunneling rates between the leads and the system . in the same context knig _",
    "et al._@xcite developed a powerful diagrammatic technique by expanding the rdo of a mesoscopic system in powers of the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "the time - dependence of the statistical operator of the coupled and interacting system implies a quantum master equation for the so called populations . in this method",
    "the coulomb interactions are treated exactly , which makes it appealing for studying various correlation effects like cotunneling.@xcite the connection between the real - time diagrammatic approach of knig _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and the nakajima - zwanzig approach@xcite to the generalized master equation ( gme ) approach was made transparent by timm.@xcite    more recently li and yan@xcite combined the @xmath2-resolved master equation and the time dependent density - functional method to write down a kohn - sham master equation for the reduced _ single - particle _ density matrix .",
    "also , esposito and galperin,@xcite using the equation of motion for the hubbard operators , have obtained a many - body description of quantum transport in an open system and established a connection between the gme and non - equilibrium greeen s functions .",
    "they studied simple systems in the steady state regime : a resonant level coupled to a a single vibration mode , an interacting dot with two spins , and a two - level bridge .",
    "another recent work by darau _",
    "et al._@xcite implemented the gme for a benzene single - electron transistor and used exact mes to compute _ steady state _",
    "currents within the markov approximation .",
    "@xcite the stability diagram and the conductance peaks were obtained and a current blocking due to interferences between degenerated orbitals was noticed .    in our previous papers@xcite",
    "we considered the gme method for the rdo of independent electrons in the fock space .",
    "we discussed the transient transport through quantum dots and quantum wires .",
    "the contact between the leads and the sample was switched on at a certain initial moment @xmath3 .",
    "we discussed extensively the occupation of the states within the bias window and the geometrical effects on the transient currents .",
    "we described the coupling between the sample and the leads via a tunneling hamiltonian in which we took into account the spatial extension of the wave functions of both subsystems in the contact region .    in spite of",
    "earlier or more recent attempts a complete description of the coulomb effects in the time - dependent transport is still missing , especially in sample models larger than a few sites . in the present work",
    "we combine the gme method with the coulomb interaction in the sample and we analyze the dynamics of the electrons starting with the moment when the leads are coupled to the sample until a steady state is reached .",
    "the coulomb interaction is included in the hamiltonian of the isolated sample and the _ interacting _ mes are calculated with the exact diagonalization method .",
    "this means the coulomb interaction is fully included with no mean field assumption or density - functional model .",
    "the number of single - electron states ( ses ) used to define the matrix elements of the hamiltonian of interacting electrons is sufficiently large such that the mes of interest are convergent . due to the finite bias window only a limited number of mes",
    "participate to the charge transport through the sample , _",
    "i.e. _  only those energetically compatible with the electrons in the leads",
    ". hence the mes of interest are selected by the chemical potentials in the leads .",
    "we calculate the rdo matrix elements in the subspace of these mes using the gme .",
    "the electron - electron interaction in the leads is neglected .",
    "it is well known that the fock space increases exponentially with the number of ses .",
    "in addition the time dependent numerical solution of the gme is also computational expensive .",
    "so at this stage we are limited to describe only few electrons in the system : up to five in a small system , but only up to three in a larger one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the gme , the inclusion of the coulomb interaction , and the selection of the mes .",
    "next , in section 3 , we show results for three models : a short 1d chain , a 2d lattice of 12@xmath410 sites , and a finite quantum wire with parabolic lateral confinement .",
    "conclusions and discussions are presented in section 4 .",
    "in this section we summarize the main lines of our method .",
    "the equations apply both to the lattice and continuous models .",
    "the time - dependent transport problem is considered within the partitioning approach which is known both from the pioneering work of caroli @xcite and from the derivation of the gme .",
    "prior to an initial time @xmath3 the left lead ( l ) having a `` source '' role , and the right lead ( r ) having a `` drain '' role , are not connected to the sample and therefore can be characterized by equilibrium states with chemical potentials @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "our aim is to compute the time dependent currents flowing through the sample and leads starting at moment @xmath3 , when the three subsystems are connected , until a stationary state is reached .",
    "the generic hamiltonian of the total system consisting of the sample plus the leads is : @xmath7 @xmath8 with @xmath9 are the hamiltonians of the leads .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the single - particle energies and wave functions respectively , for each lead . using the creation and",
    "annihilation operators associated to the single - particle states , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we can write @xmath14 @xmath15 is the hamiltonian of the sample . in the absence of the interaction the ses have discrete energies denoted as @xmath16 and corresponding one - body wave functions @xmath17 .",
    "using now the creation and annihilation operators for the sample ses , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we can write @xmath20 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ hsample ] ) is the coulomb interaction . in the ses basis",
    "the two - body matrix elements are given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coulomb potential .",
    "the third term of eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) is the so - called tunneling hamiltonian describing the transfer of particles between the leads and the sample : @xmath23 @xmath24 contains two important elements : ( 1 ) the time dependent switching functions @xmath25 which open the contact between the leads and the sample ; these functions mimic the presence of a time dependent potential barrier . ( 2 ) the coupling @xmath26 between a state with momentum @xmath27 of the lead @xmath28 and the state @xmath2 of the isolated sample , with wave function @xmath29 .",
    "the coupling coefficients @xmath26 depend on the energies of the coupled states and , maybe more important , on the amplitude of the wave functions in the contact region .",
    "as we have shown in our previous work @xcite this construction allows us to capture geometrical effects in the electronic transfer .",
    "a precise definition of the coupling coefficients is however model specific , and will be mentioned in the next section .",
    "the evolution of our system is completely determined by the statistical operator @xmath30 associated to the total hamiltonian @xmath31 defined in eq.([htot ] ) .",

    "after the coupling moment the dynamics of the sample is conveniently described by the rdo which is defined by averaging the total statistical operator over those degrees of freedom belonging to the leads : @xmath35 in the absence of the electron - electron interaction the mes eigenvectors of @xmath15 are bit - strings of the form @xmath36 is the occupation number of the @xmath2-th ses . the set @xmath37 is a basis in the fock space of the isolated sample and the rdo can be seen as a matrix in this basis . from eqs .",

    "i.e._the _ interacting _ mes , the gme has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ gmefin ] ) , where the matrix elements of all operators are now defined in the interacting basis and the matrix elements of the coupling operators are @xmath50 because the sample is open the number of electrons @xmath0 contained in the sample is not fixed .",

    "( [ hsample ] ) commutes with the total `` number '' operator @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath0 is a `` good quantum number '' such that any state @xmath52 has a fixed number of electrons .",
    "so the mes can also be labeled as @xmath53 with @xmath54 an index for the ground and excited states of the mes subset with @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the many - body energies can also be written as @xmath55 . in the practical calculations @xmath0 varies between 0 ( the vacuum state ) and @xmath56 which is the total number of ses considered in the numerical diagonalization of @xmath15 .",
    "the total number of mes is thus @xmath57 .",
    "if the coupling between the leads and the sample is not too strong we expect that only a limited number of mes participate effectively to the electronic transport .",
    "these states are naturally selected by the bias window @xmath58 $ ] . in the following examples , by selecting suitable values of the chemical potentials in the leads , we will truncate the basis of interacting mes to a reasonably small subset such that we can solve numerically eq .",
    "( [ gmefin ] ) with our available computing resources . to relate the bias window with the effective mes we need to consider the chemical potential of the isolated sample containing @xmath0 electrons , @xmath59 which is the energy required to add the @xmath0-th electron on top of the ground state with @xmath60 to obtain the @xmath61-th mes with @xmath0 particles.@xcite we expect the current associated to the mes @xmath62 to depend on the location of the chemical potential @xmath63 relatively to the bias window .",
    "in particular it is clear that if at the coupling moment @xmath3 the sample is empty all mes with @xmath64 will remain empty both during the transient and the steady states , so they can be safely ignored when solving the gme .",

    "we also do not need to cut the mes basis , all matrix elements of the statistical operator can be numerically calculated , even if not all of them might be important for the currents .",
    "in addition we will consider the strength of the coulomb interaction as a free parameter @xmath76 , whereas in a realistic systems this is fixed by the electron charge and the dielectric constant of the material .",

    "we obtain in the steady state the mean number of electrons about 3.6 and a non - vanishing current in the leads .",
    "this is understandable , since @xmath93 , which is the 4-th level of the isolated sample .",
    "the occupation of this level in the steady state is about 0.6 , the other states being either full or empty .",
    "also in this case , the excited states have small contributions to the steady state current as the system tends to be in the ground state with @xmath94 electrons .",

    "e.g. _ for @xmath96 , the system settles down in the coulomb blockade regime , the total current being almost suppressed in the steady state .",
    "this happens because the interaction pushes the chemical potentials upwards such that for @xmath96 both ground states with @xmath94 and @xmath97 electrons are outside the bias window and can not produce steady currents . when the interaction strength is further increased to @xmath98 and @xmath99 the steady state currents are gradually restored",
