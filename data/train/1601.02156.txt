    "financial derivative contracts have been criticized for their role in the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis .",
    "the opacity of such contracts  and the fact that they are often unregulated or traded over - the - counter ( otc )  has drawn criticism , in particular to credit default swaps ( cdss ) .",
    "cdss were created in the 1990s as a risk management tool by which a loan could be insured against default risk .",
    "their use is however mostly speculative and has drastically increased since the early 2000s . by 2007 ,",
    "the size of this market ( in terms of outstanding cds amount ) was @xmath0 trillion and , although it decreased after the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 , it remained considerable at about @xmath1 trillion in 2012 .    in a financial system ,",
    "institutions are interconnected through a complex network of exposures .",
    "this complex web of financial exposures creates systemic risk : the insolvency of a particular institution and the resulting default on its loans can precipitate other institutions into insolvency , thereby generating an insolvency cascade .",
    "studying financial systems from a network perspective has thus received a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "it is now known that different financial network topologies have different impacts on the probability of systemic collapse @xcite . in this sense managing systemic risk",
    "reduces to the technical problem of re - shaping the topology of financial networks . properly used ,",
    "cdss have the effect of transferring a financial exposure from one institution to another",
    ". they can thus be used to change the topology of the financial network of interbank exposures . to understand whether cdss can be efficiently used for risk management ,",
    "it is thus essential to study the impact they have on the topology of financial networks .    in this article",
    ", we describe how a regulator can use cdss to restructure the interbank network .",
    "banks are exposed to each other through interbank loans resulting from the conduct of normal banking operations . to guard against the risk of default of a counter - party on a given loan , a bank can buy a cds contract from another bank .",
    "a regulator can then use information about the topology of the interbank system to impose a systemic insurance ` surcharge ' that is added to the cds spread .",
    "this surcharge is proportional to the amount of systemic risk created by the contract .",
    "this effectively constitutes a mechanism that taxes cds contracts according to how they contribute to increasing systemic risk .",
    "cds contracts that decrease systemic risk  by reallocating exposures more efficiently  remain untaxed .",
    "this mechanism has the effect of ` matching ' cds counter - parties in a way that reduces systemic risk . with an agent - based model ( crisis macro - financial model ) ,",
    "we demonstrate how this mechanism leads to a self - organized re - structuring of the interbank system that makes it considerably more resilient to insolvency cascades .",
    "one of our contributions is to study the financial system as a multi - layer network . here",
    "the different layers represent different types of contractual obligations ( loans , derivatives ) .",
    "we show that insolvency cascades can spread through these different types of edges in non - standard ways .",
    "this complements recent treatments of systemic risk in multilayered networks ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our main contribution is however to propose a mechanism to regulate the cds market so as to control the formation of the interbank network ( modeled as a multi - layer network ) .",
    "the existing literature , on the other hand , is fairly young and has mainly focused on the introduction of a central clearing house for derivatives ( and the associated effects of bilateral netting ) or on setting collateral levels ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the only other similar mechanisms proposed were in @xcite .",
    "we also show that an unregulated cds market , in which banks are allowed to speculate by buying cds on loans that they do not own , can drastically increase systemic risk by creating many contagion channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : multilayernet ] , we present a multi - layer model of the interbank system , which allows us to study how cdss affect the topology of exposures between the banks . in section [ sec : regcdsmarket ] , we introduce a measure of systemic risk that allows us to characterize how a particular cds contract increases or decreases systemic risk .",
    "we then discuss how a regulator can design a systemic surcharge mechanism for cds contracts , which effectively rewires the interbank system . in section [ sec : sims ] , we simulate this mechanism using an agent - based model ( crisis macro - financial model ) and show that it can considerably improve the resilience of the interbank system to insolvency cascades .",
    "let us consider a financial system composed of @xmath2 banks . based on their liquidity needs ,",
    "these banks extend loans to each other .",
    "assume that there can be more than one loan between banks @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the value of the @xmath7-th loan extended by @xmath4 to @xmath3 .",
    "we let @xmath8 so that @xmath9 means @xmath4 has a positive net exposure to @xmath3 . this quantity then allows us to define the net exposure matrix as @xmath10    a positive entry @xmath11 represents the net exposure of @xmath4 to @xmath3 while @xmath12 means that @xmath4 is not exposed to @xmath3 .",
    "the net exposure matrix @xmath13 defines a _ network _ of net exposures , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ib_loans ] .",
    "loans carry credit risk : in the event of bank @xmath3 s default , bank @xmath4 may not be able to recover the net amount @xmath14 that it has lent to bank @xmath3 .",
    "the network of loan exposures @xmath13 creates _",
    "systemic risk_. indeed , the impact of the default of some borrower @xmath3 not only affects the lender @xmath4 itself , but potentially the lenders creditors as well as their own creditors and so on . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : ib_loans ] , the insolvency of bank @xmath15 not only affects bank @xmath16 , but may also propagate to banks @xmath17 and @xmath18 , thus generating an insolvency cascade .",
    "likewise , the lender is not only vulnerable to the defaults of his own borrowers , but also to the defaults of his borrowers borrowers and so on . in an interbank network ,",
    "credit risk thus ceases to be a local property and becomes _",
    "systemic_. such insolvency cascades have been extensively studied , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the size of an insolvency cascade is shown to depend on the topology of the exposures network .",
    "systemic risk must thus be understood as a network property .    in order to guard against the risk of default of a borrower , a lending bank can insure its loan using a financial instrument known as a credit default swap ( cds ) .      a credit default swap ( cds )",
    "is a financial swap agreement , in which the buyer makes a series of periodic payments ( known as ` spread ' payments ) in exchange for a promise that the seller will compensate the buyer in the event of default on some specific reference loan ( or bond ) .",
    "if the cds buyer holds the reference loan , it is thus a form of insurance contract . in the event of default on that reference loan ,",
    "the buyer of the cds typically receives an amount equal to the par value of the loan from the cds seller .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdsbasics ] , where a bank @xmath3 buys cds protection from bank @xmath4 on some reference loan @xmath19 extended to bank @xmath20 .     and seller @xmath4 on some reference loan @xmath19 .",

    "[ fig : cdsbasics ] , the buyer ( bank @xmath3 ) also owns the reference loan @xmath21 , then the cds is used as insurance against the default of @xmath20",
    ". we will refer to such a contract as a ` covered ' cds .",
    "in reality , the buyer of the cds need not own the reference loan @xmath19 .",
    "the latter will then be referred to as a ` naked ' cds and can allow the parties to speculate on the credit worthiness of the reference entity ( bank @xmath20 ) .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the promised payment of the cds contract sold by bank @xmath4 to bank @xmath3 in the event of default of the reference entity @xmath20 on the reference loan @xmath19 .",
    "we can now define @xmath23 as the total promised payments on cds contracts sold by bank @xmath4 to bank @xmath3 in the event of default of @xmath20 .",
    "we let @xmath24 so that @xmath25 means @xmath4 has a positive net cds exposure to @xmath3 .",
    "this quantity then allows us to define the net cds exposure matrix on the reference entity @xmath20 :    @xmath26    a positive entry @xmath27 represents the net cds exposure of @xmath4 to @xmath3 on the reference entity @xmath20 . in the event of @xmath20",
    "s default , @xmath4 will thus have to pay this amount to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath28 means that @xmath4 has no cds exposure to @xmath3 on the reference entity @xmath20 .",
    "note that the collection of all cds exposure matrices @xmath29 defines a multiplex network , i.e. a network where different types of edges may exist between different banks .",
    "each particular type of edge represents a net cds exposure on a particular reference entity @xmath20 .",
    "the edge type is thus labeled by @xmath20 .",
    "the interbank system can thus be represented as a two - layer network : the first layer represents the network of loan exposures @xmath13 between the @xmath2 banks , while the second layer represents the multiplex network of cds exposures between the @xmath2 banks .",
    "such a two - layer representation is similar to that used in @xcite .",
    "it is represented in fig . [",
    "fig : multilayer ] .        from that figure",
    ", we see that a directed edge @xmath30 of weight @xmath14 on layer @xmath31 represents the net loan exposure of bank @xmath4 to bank @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "a directed edge @xmath30 of weight @xmath32 represents the net amount that bank @xmath4 will have to pay bank @xmath3 in the event of the default of bank @xmath20 .",
    "note that the relations between the different layers are highly non - standard .",
    "the default of a particular bank will not only affect its creditors , but also the banks that have sold cds contracts on that reference bank .",
    "it may therefore be difficult to measure the impact of the bankruptcy of one bank on the system as it depends on the interaction between the layers .",
    "fortunately , this multi - layer network can be conveniently mapped to a single - layer network , representing the _ _ effective net exposures _ _ of banks to one another .",
    "this effective net exposure is defined , for any banks @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as @xmath33    this mapping of the two layers into a single exposure layer is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_exp_cds ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_exp_naked_cds ] .            in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_exp_cds ] , we see that ` covered ' cds contracts have the effect of rewiring the network of loan exposures by transferring exposures from one bank to another . in this simple example , there are @xmath15 banks and only one cds exposure on reference entity ( bank ) @xmath34 .",
    "thus bank @xmath31 has bought a cds from bank @xmath35 on the reference bank @xmath34 .",
    "the value of the cds exposure here is @xmath36 so that bank @xmath31 has insured its net loan exposure to bank @xmath34 against the possible default of bank @xmath34 .",
    "this loan exposure @xmath36 is thus effectively transferred to @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_exp_cds ] , the buyer of the cds ( bank @xmath31 ) also owns the reference loan @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_exp_naked_cds ] , we show the effect of a ` naked ' cds on the network of effective exposures . in this case",
    ", bank @xmath31 buys a cds on a loan that it does not own ( i.e. @xmath37 ) .",
    "the effect is the creation of a new edge in the network of effective exposures .",
    "thus instead of rewiring the network , a naked cds has the potential to create new contagion channels .",
    "as a network property , systemic risk can be quantified by network metrics .",
    "one such metric is debtrank @xcite , which is a recursive method to determine the systemic relevance of nodes within a financial network .",
    "debtrank has a natural interpretation as the fraction of the total economic value in the financial network that is potentially lost as a result of the default ( or distress ) of a bank ( or a set of banks ) .",
    "considering the network of effective exposures @xmath38 and the capital @xmath39 $ ] of all banks , the debtrank @xmath40 of bank @xmath3 can be readily computed ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we study an environment in which cds contracts are guaranteed by some well - capitalized regulating agency .",
    "if bank @xmath3 defaults and can not honor its obligations , then bank @xmath4 may lose the value @xmath14 of its net loan exposure to bank @xmath3 .",
    "however if some bank @xmath41 has a cds exposure @xmath42 to bank @xmath4 on the reference bank @xmath3 , then it will pay bank @xmath4 an amount to compensate the loss .",
    "if bank @xmath41 is unable to fully pay this amount because its exceeds its capital , then bank @xmath41 will go bankrupt .",
    "the regulating agency will however step in to guarantee the cds payment to bank @xmath4 .",
    "the effective net exposure @xmath38 is thus the appropriate quantity to measure the exposure of one institution to another .",
    "the assumption that there is a well - capitalized regulating agency guaranteeing cds contracts has already been made in the literature .",
    "for example , see @xcite for papers that study the central clearing of derivative contracts .",
    "we can now naturally define the _ expected systemic loss _ as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the exogenous probability of default of bank @xmath3 and @xmath45 is the combined economic value of all banks .",
    "@xmath40 is the debtrank of bank @xmath3 , as introduced earlier . by _ exogenous _",
    "probability of default , we mean that @xmath44 is the probability that bank @xmath3 fails due to factors other than the default of other banks to which it is exposed .",
    "this allows us to separate exogenous ( or non network ) effects from contagion ( or network ) effects . _",
    "_    to calculate the contribution of a particular cds contract @xmath46 to the expected systemic loss , we need to adjust layer @xmath20 by updating the matrix @xmath47 as follows    @xmath48    and @xmath49 and then recalculating @xmath38 by using equations ( [ eq : cds_m])-([eq : l_eff ] ) . we denote the effective net exposure matrix in the presence of that specific cds contract by @xmath50}$ ] .",

    "it can do so by adding a _ systemic insurance surcharge _ to the spread that is normally paid on such a contract .",
    "since a regulator with knowledge of the network topology can compute the marginal effect of a cds contract on systemic risk , she can devise a surcharge that will be applied to those cds contracts that increase systemic risk .",

    "the buyer would pay the same spread @xmath55 to any seller and thus would be indifferent to which seller it buys from .",
    "indeed , the spread of a cds depends solely on the reference entity s probability of default , not on the cds seller .",
    "while the normal spread @xmath55 is collected by the cds seller , the systemic surcharge @xmath66 is collected by the regulating agency and placed in a fund that will be used to guarantee the fulfillment of cds contracts if the seller were to become insolvent .",

    "these are shown to be considerably decreased when the cds market is regulated as described previously ( shown in green ) .",
    "on the other hand , the situation becomes much worse when the cds market is unregulated ( shown in red ) and banks are allowed to speculate by buying ` naked ' cdss , i.e. cdss that are not used as insurance on an underlying loan .",
    "we see that the loss distribution is actually bimodal , i.e. there is a strong probability of very high loss , associated with total systemic collapse .",
    "[ fig : riskprofiles ] ( b ) shows the number of banks that fail in a cascades .",

    "[ fig : riskprofiles ] ( c ) shows the corresponding debtranks ( i.e. the systemic importance ) of the @xmath93 banks in each of the three different scenarios .",
    "we can clearly see that by increasing the number of contagion channels , an unregulated cds market considerably increases the systemic riskiness of each bank . on the other hand , by properly transferring exposures from one bank to another , the proposed systemic surcharge mechanism for cdss",

    "indeed , in the effective exposure network , it is rather the presence of cycles that can increase the potential size of insolvency cascades by creating long chains of exposures . since a cds market regulated with a systemic insurance surcharge",

    "the presence of cycles is the clustering coefficient . in fig . [",
