    "in recent decades , manganites with chemical compositions @xmath9mno@xmath3 , where @xmath10 is a rare - earth ( @xmath10=la , nd , pr ) and @xmath11 an alkaline - earth metal ( @xmath11=sr , ba , ca ) , have been extensively studied because of their remarkable physical properties such as colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) and spin , charge and orbital ordering @xcite .",
    "historically , their magnetic and transport properties have been discussed in terms of double - exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "half - doped manganites ( @xmath12 @xmath13 0.5 ) have been a focus of recent studies because most of them exhibit a so - called charge exchange ( ce)-type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) charge - ordered ( co ) state .",
    "the compound pr@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 ( pcmo ) , in which the bandwidth @xmath14 is small in comparison with other manganites , has a particularly stable co state over the wide hole concentration region between @xmath12 @xmath13 0.3 and 0.75 as shown in the electronic phase diagram in fig .",
    "furthermore , cmr in the co state of pcmo has been found remarkable , amounting to several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 @xcite.,width=226 ]    the origin of the cmr effect has been debated in recent years since it was pointed out that de mechanism alone was insufficient to explain the large resistivity change with magnetization @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility of charge self - organization such as phase separation ( ps ) as the origin of the cmr effect has been discussed in theoretical and experimental studies . in computational work based on quantum monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the possibility of ps into the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and afm phases has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "the calculated density of electrons @xmath15 versus chemical potential @xmath16 for a one - dimensional model has shown a clear discontinuity in @xmath15 at a particular value of @xmath16 , indicating a ps @xcite since in general electronic ps results in the pinning of @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , electron microscopy studies have revealed inhomogeneous spatial images in which the fm charge - disordered and afm co microdomains coexist @xcite .",
    "however , it has been unclear whether they are driven by ( intrinsic ) tendency toward electronic ps or triggered by ( extrinsic ) chemical inhomogenity . electronic  ps \" on a nano - meter scale such as stripe formation would also lead to the pinning of the chemical potential , in analogy to the case of high-@xmath17 cuprates @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown theoretically that the introduction of chemical disorder turns the chemical potential pinning into a smooth shift @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can distinguish intrinsic electronic inhomogenity from extrinsic chemical disorder through the measurements of chemical potential shift .",
    "the chemical potential shift can be deduced from the core - level shifts of photoemission spectra as functions of carrier concentration .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the chemical potential shift in la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 ( lsmo ) , which has the widest bandwidth among the manganites , shows a monotonous shift without indication of chemical potential pinning , especially around @xmath12 @xmath13 0.3 , where the cmr effect is the strongest @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been considered that there is no intrinsic electronic  ps \" in lsmo . in spite of the smooth shift in the core levels , changes in the electronic structure of lsmo near the fermi level ( @xmath0 ) with carrier doping",
    "were highly non - rigid - band like in the sense that the mn 3@xmath6 @xmath7 peak lost its intensity with hole doping while its position relative to @xmath0 remained nearly unchanged @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a core - level photoemission study of the chemical potential shift @xmath18 as a function of carrier concentration and the composition dependence of the valence - band spectra in single crystals of pcmo .",
    "the results show that the chemical potential pinning occurs for @xmath5 , spectral weight is transferred toward near @xmath0 with hole doping , and there is a finite intensity at @xmath0 in the paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) phase on the high temperature side of the co transition temperature for @xmath5 .",
    "single crystals of pcmo with the carrier concentrations of @xmath19 , 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.35 , 0.45 , 0.5 , and 0.65 were grown by the floating - zone method .",
    "the growth techniques and transport properties of the crystals were described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) measurements using synchrotron radiation were performed at bl-2c of photon factory , high energy acceleration research organization ( kek ) .",
    "we carried out the measurements using the photon energies of @xmath20 600 ev , 643.6 ev ( mn 2@xmath21 - 3@xmath6 resonance ) , 800 ev , and 930 ev ( pr 3@xmath6 - 4@xmath22 resonance ) .",
    "ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) and x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) measurements were also performed using the photon energies of @xmath20 21.2 ev ( he i ) and 1253.6 ev ( mg @xmath23 ) .",
    "all the photoemission measurements were performed under the base pressure of @xmath24 torr at room temperature .",
    "the samples were repeatedly scraped _ in situ _ with a diamond file to obtain clean surfaces . in the case of pes using synchrotron radiation and xps , the cleanliness of the sample surface was checked by the reduction of the shoulder on the high binding energy side of the o 1@xmath25 core level . in the case of ups , the scraping was made until a bump around 9 - 10 ev , which is attributed to surface contamination , decreased and the valence - band spectra did not change with further scrapings .",
    "photoelectrons were collected using a scienta ses-100 electron - energy analyzer .",
    "the energy resolution was about 200 - 500 mev for the synchrotron radiation measurements , 20 mev for he i , and 800 mev for mg @xmath23 .",
    "the measured binding energies were stable , judged from the fact the gold @xmath26 core - level spectrum was nearly unchanged throughout the measurements .",
    "in order to deduce the chemical potential shift from a set of core - level data , we utilize the formula @xcite that the shift @xmath27 of the binding energy is given by @xmath27 = @xmath18 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath28 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 , where @xmath18 is the change in the chemical potential , @xmath33 is the coupling constant of the coulomb interaction between the valence and the core electrons , @xmath34 is the change in the number of valence electrons on the atom considered , @xmath30 is the change in the madelung potential , and @xmath32 is the change in the extra - atomic relaxation energy .",
    "here , @xmath34 produces changes in the electrostatic potential at the core - hole site as well as in the intra - atomic relaxation energy of the core - hole final state .",
    "@xmath32 is due to changes in the screening of the core - hole potential by metallic - conduction electrons and polarizable surrounding ions .",
    "figure 2 shows the photoemission spectra of the o @xmath35 , ca @xmath36 , pr @xmath37 , and mn @xmath36 core levels taken at @xmath20 800 ev . the line shapes of most of the core levels did not change significantly for these compositions . nevertheless ,",
    "because the line shape on the higher binding energy side of the o @xmath35 was sensitive to a slight surface degradation or contamination , we used the midpoint of the lower binding energy slope rather than the peak position for the o @xmath35 core level to deduce the amount of the core - level shift more reliably .",
    "we also used the midpoint for ca @xmath36 .",
    "as for pr @xmath37 and mn 2@xmath21 , the peak position was used because the line shape slightly changed with doping and therefore the midpoint position was less meaningful . also , the photoemission spectra for @xmath38 , 0.3 , and 0.35 were measured at @xmath20 1253.6 ev , and the shifts of @xmath38 , and 0.35 relative to @xmath39 were determined .",
    "ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 taken at @xmath20 800 ev .",
    "( a ) o @xmath35 ; ( b ) ca @xmath36 ; ( c ) pr 4@xmath6 ; ( d ) mn 2@xmath21 .",
    "the intensity has been normalized to the peak height.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the binding energy shifts of the o @xmath35 , ca @xmath36 , pr @xmath37 , and mn @xmath36 core levels are plotted .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "3(a ) that the observed binding energy shifts with @xmath12 were approximately common to the o @xmath35 , ca @xmath36 , and pr @xmath37 core levels , whereas the shift of the mn @xmath36 core level was different from them .",
    "the similar shifts of the o @xmath35 , ca @xmath36 , and pr @xmath37 core levels indicate that the change in the madelung potential @xmath30 has negligible effects on the core - level shifts because it would cause shifts of the core levels of the o@xmath40 anion and the ca@xmath41 and pr@xmath42 cations in different directions .",
    "core - hole screening @xmath32 by conduction electrons can also be excluded from the main origin of the core - level shifts in transition - metal oxides @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath27 @xmath13 @xmath18 + @xmath29 . the @xmath29 term is important for the mn @xmath36 core - level shift because of the increase in the mn valence with hole doping @xmath43 from mn@xmath42 towards mn@xmath44 , @xmath45 because of the so - called chemical shift . therefore , we consider that the shifts of the o @xmath35 , ca @xmath36 , and pr @xmath37 core levels are largely due to the chemical potential shift @xmath18 , and take the average of the shifts of the three core levels as a measure of @xmath18 in pcmo .    in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we have plotted @xmath18 in pcmo thus deduced as a function of carrier concentration .",
    "the shift was large in the region @xmath46 , which may be understood in analogy to the case of lsmo @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the chemical potential shift was observed near and in the co region @xmath5 .",
    "if the suppression of the chemical potential shift is due to an electronic ps as the thermodynamic relationship suggests , in order to gain the long - range coulomb energy the ps should occur only on a microscopic scale as in the bi - stripe or wigner - crystal model suggested for la@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we note that in la@xmath48sr@xmath2cuo@xmath49 and la@xmath48sr@xmath2nio@xmath49 the suppression of the chemical potential shift is most likely related to the formation of stripes @xcite .",
    "although our measurements were done in the pi phase above the co transition temperature , fluctuations of the co state are expected to be present in the pi phase as was observed by means of x - ray resonant scattering @xcite . also , from the observed suppression of @xmath18 in the region around @xmath50 , which exhibits the ferromagnetic insulating phase at low temperatures , we speculate that the fluctuation of the co state also exist over a finite concentration range around the phase boundary at @xmath12 = 0.3 .",
    "since the effect of disorder was found to strongly influence the chemical potential shift @xcite , disorder strength in pcmo has to be evaluated . according to the variance of the ionic radii of the a - site cation , the effect of disorder in pcmo as well as that in lsmo is very small @xcite .    , ca @xmath36 , pr @xmath37 , and mn @xmath36 core levels as functions of carrier concentration @xmath12 ; ( b ) chemical potential shift @xmath18 in pr@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 as a function of carrier concentration @xmath12.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "4 , we compare @xmath18 for pcmo with that for lsmo . for @xmath46 ,",
    "both @xmath18 curves show similar doping dependences in the sense that the shifts are monotonous .",
    "the difference between the two become pronounced for @xmath5 , where the co state occurs or the fluctuation of co state becomes significant in pcmo but not in lsmo .",
    "therefore , the different chemical potential shifts in pcmo and lsmo indeed reflect the co in pcmo , and the @xmath16 pinning in the co state of pcmo can be understood as due to the stronger tendencies toward  ps \" in pcmo .",
    "considering the suppression of @xmath18 in pcmo , the absence of such suppression in lsmo and the much stronger cmr in pcmo than in lsmo , it is possible that the tendency towards electronic  ps \" on a microscopic scale is the origin of cmr in manganite with co state .",
    "more systematic studies on other manganites as well as temperature - dependent studies of the chemical potential shift will shed further light on the relationship between cmr and electronic  ps \" .",
    "ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 with that in la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 @xcite.,width=321 ]      valence - band spectra of pcmo taken at different photon energies are shown in fig .",
    "the spectra mainly consisted of structures as labeled a , ( a , ) b , c , ( c , c `` , ) and d. the spectra taken at @xmath20 930 and 643.6 ev correspond to pr 3@xmath6 - 4@xmath22 and mn 2@xmath21 - 3@xmath6 on - resonance pes spactra , respectively . from the mn 2@xmath21 - 3@xmath6 resonance spectra , mn 3@xmath6-derived features appeared as structures a , c , and d. structures a and c are shifted slightly toward higher binding energies than a and c , respectively , due to the different matrix elements between normal pes and resonant pes .",
    "also , the intensity of structure c '' was strongly enhanced in the pr 3@xmath6 - 4@xmath22 resonance spectra .",
    "the ups ( @xmath20 21.2 ev ) spectrum represents the o 2@xmath21 state due to the large relative photo - ionization cross - section of o 2@xmath21 at low photon energies .",
    "therefore , structures a , b , c , and d in the ups spectrum are assigned to the mn 3@xmath6-o 2@xmath21 bonding state , the non - bonding o 2@xmath21 state , the mn 3@xmath6 @xmath51 plus the pr 4@xmath22 states , and the mn 3@xmath6 @xmath7 state , respectively , consistent with the cluster - model calculation for lsmo @xcite .",

    "the spectra have been normalized to the integrated intensity in the energy range from 1.5 ev to @xmath8 @xmath0 .",
    "two features labeled d and d `` were observed in these spectra .",
    "spectral weight was transferred from d to d '' with increasing hole concentration , that is , the valence - band spectra near @xmath0 exhibited highly non - rigid - band - like behavior , similar to that in the lsmo @xcite .",
    "similar behaviors have been widely observed in filling - controlled transition - metal oxides @xcite .",
    "this spectral weight transfer may be related to dynamical stripe formation because the hole - rich and hole - poor regions would give rise to the low and high binding energy features , respectively , and the relative contributions of the hole - rich regions would increase with hole doping @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss the origin of the finite spectral weight at @xmath0 in the insulating phase of pcmo .",
    "the spectra in a narrow energy region near @xmath0 are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "for @xmath12 = 0.2 , and 0.25 , the insulating gap was opened . for @xmath5 , a finite intensity at @xmath0",
    "was observed in the pi phase , leading to the pseudogap behavior .",

    "were also observed in the pi phase of the pcmo @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider that the pseudogap features for @xmath5 , namely , the density of states ( dos ) minimum and the finite intensity at @xmath0 are caused by the co fluctuations and fm fluctuations , respectively .",
    "monte carlo simulations on the ps model have shown that the pseudogap behavior is caused by the formation of fm metallic clusters in an insulating background , and the resultant mixed - phase state is crucial for the pseudogap formation @xcite . in the pi phase of bi@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 ,",
    "an atomic - scale image of ps into fm metallic and insulating regions was observed by means of scanning tunneling microscopy , and it is considered that the fm fluctuations are related to thermally activated hopping of @xmath7 electrons induced by de mechanism at high temperatures @xcite .",
