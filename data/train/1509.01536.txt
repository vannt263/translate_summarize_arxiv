    ", it is argued that replacing the @xmath0-channel single - meson exchange ( third diagram in fig .",

    "( [ eq : gwtiint ] ) amounts to the formulation of the effective charge difference across the reaction in the presence of hadronic vertices with structure .",
    "it is of paramount importance here that all three four - divergence equations are off - shell relations , and that the off - shellness is a necessary requirement for local gauge invariance  @xcite since it ensures that the ( off - shell ) current @xmath7 provides the correct , consistent contributions to gauge invariance even if it is embedded as an off - shell subprocess in a larger process ( for example , electromagnetic production of two or more mesons  @xcite ) .    with the off - shell wtis ( [ eq : wti ] ) and ( [ eq : gwti ] ) given , global gauge invariance follows trivially by taking the respective on - shell matrix elements , with the inverse propagators in the four - divergences ( [ eq : wti ] ) and ( [ eq : gwti ] ) then ensuring that the four - divergences vanish ; in particular , @xmath37 to be sure , this is a necessary condition the physical production current needs to satisfy that follows trivially from local gauge invariance , however , this on - shell restriction by itself contains no information that allows one to meaningfully ` guess ' at a nontrivial structure for @xmath7 .",

    "note , in particular , that the structure of this equation does not change even if the external hadrons are on shell , and thus  quite in contrast to the current - conservation condition ( [ eq : currconserved ] )  _ even its on - shell limit provides a nontrivial constraint _ that ensures that the on - shell result ( [ eq : currconserved ] ) is a consequence of _ local _ gauge invariance and not just mere global gauge invariance .",
    "to see what needs to be done to restore gauge invariance in the regge case , let us first look at how the usual @xmath0-channel term as depicted by the third diagram in fig .",

    "the operator @xmath35 summarily describes the isospin dependence of the vertex , with relevant indices suppressed .",
    "combined with the respective charge operators @xmath46 for the three legs of the vertex , one obtains  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 provides charge conservation across the reaction .",
    "taken in an appropriate isospin basis , the charge - isospin operators @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are equal to the respective charges of the individual legs .    we will need only on - shell kinematics here where all external hadron legs of fig .  [ fig : msutc ] sit on their respective mass shells .",
    "the form factors associated with the vertices @xmath21 , @xmath22 , for these cases are    @xmath52    where the mandelstam variables ( [ eq : mandelstam ] ) are used .",
    "the @xmath0-channel vertex , in particular , then reads @xmath53 and for the corresponding meson - exchange propagator , we may write without lack of generality @xmath54 where the pole at @xmath55 was pulled out explicitly and the residual numerator @xmath56 defined by this relation may describe dressing effects and/or the coupling structure of the propagator . in the simplest cases , @xmath57 equals unity for pseudoscalar mesons and @xmath58 for vector mesons ( in feynman gauge ) , for example .",

    "the second term , however , has no counterpart in the four - divergence ( [ eq : gwtiint ] ) and thus violates local gauge invariance ( and therefore obviously also global gauge invariance ) .",
    "this violation comes about because in the regge treatment _ all _ particles on the trajectory are taken to couple to the photon with the _ same _ current @xmath69 as the primary base state , whereas if one were to incorporate these contributions via feynman - type exchange mechanisms , each of the higher - lying states would couple transversely to the photon because the corresponding currents are transition currents for the transition from intermediate higher - mass states to the lower - mass primary base state , which is the final meson state of the reaction , and such transverse transition currents would not contribute to the four - divergence .    clearly , to restore local gauge invariance , regge treatment of the @xmath0-channel by itself",
    "is not enough  one _ must _ also reggeize the interaction current @xmath14 so that its four - divergence will provide the necessary cancellation of the offending contribution in ( [ eq : gaugerviol ] ) , thus in essence restoring the transversality of these contributions with higher mass .",
    "in other words , to preserve local gauge invariance , one must apply the reggeization process consistently across all elements of the production current @xmath7 . since @xmath0-channel - type exchanges also contribute ( as off - shell processes ) to the internal mechanisms of @xmath14 , an appropriate reggeization of such internal exchanges should provide the cancellation for the offending term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaugerviol ] ) .    obviously then , treating regge consistently with local gauge invariance simply entails consistently replacing the usual @xmath0-channel vertex @xmath70 by the reggeized vertex @xmath71 everywhere .",
    "in addition to the reggeized @xmath0-channel current ( [ eq : treggemod ] ) , this also requires modification of the contact current , @xmath72 such that the reggeized contribution from the corresponding four - divergence , @xmath73 now cancels the previously gauge - invariance - violating term from ( [ eq : gaugerviol ] ) .",

    "the procedure is straightforward , and we provide the corresponding generic expressions for the minimal interaction current that restores local gauge invariance in the appendix .",

    "consistent with the underlying field - theoretical foundations of such processes  @xcite , we have argued that this must be done by constructing contact - type interaction currents whose four - divergence compensates for the wrong coupling to the electromagnetic field of higher - mass contributions of the regge trajectory that is responsible for the violation of gauge invariance .",
    "the construction principle was based on the underlying generalized ward - takahashi identities whose validity ensure local gauge invariance .",
    "we emphasize once more in this respect that mere ( on - shell ) current conservation , @xmath10 , is not very helpful as a starting point for repairing gauge - invariance violations .",
    "as argued , the goal of any repair mechanism must be the construction of an interaction current @xmath155 that satisfies the crucial four - divergence condition ( [ eq : gwtiint ] ) for this interaction current .",
    "the resulting local gauge - invariance property will then automatically ensure a conserved on - shell current @xmath7 .    the present way of maintaining local gauge invariance in terms of a regge form factor @xmath65 to replace the usual @xmath0-channel cutoff function @xmath112 shows that when viewed from the feynman perspective , the regge approach basically can be understood as a prescription for the functional form of the @xmath0-channel form factor .",
    "numerical test show that at ( negative ) physical @xmath0 ( and fixed @xmath9 ) , the main features of @xmath65 that survive are the exponential scale factor and the phase function , @xmath156~.    \\label{eq : reggescale}\\ ] ] this exponential function falls off faster than any power - law form factor and thus compared to a conventional phenomenological form factor drastically cuts out the high-@xmath157 ( i.e. , backward - angle ) scattering contributions .",
    "the onset of the ` regge regime ' is oftentimes very much under debate in practical applications , in particular , if regge exchanges are employed at intermediate - energy ranges within hybrid approaches as discussed here that mix regge with the traditional feynman picture . in this situation",
    ", it seems natural to consider mechanisms for smooth transitions into that regime  @xcite .",
    "an interpolating mechanism like @xmath158 , for example , that determines an effective @xmath0-channel form factor @xmath159 somewhere between its non - regge ( @xmath112 ) and regge ( @xmath65 ) limits in terms of an ( @xmath9- and @xmath0-dependent ) interpolating function @xmath160 can be fine - tuned to the requirements of particular applications  @xcite . hence",
    ", fitting the interpolation parameters to experimental data lets the data ` decide ' whether regge exchanges should be necessary or not for a particular process at a particular photon energy .",
    "since this would take much of the contention out of the debate , we strongly advocate employing such interpolation schemes .",
    "this may be especially advisable for energy ranges where details of baryon - resonance structure may still play a role .",
    "clearly , the procedure outlined here is not affected by such an interpolation scheme since @xmath159 is normalized to unity by construction and may thus be used for building a contact current , just like @xmath112 or @xmath65 .",
    "a similarly useful interpolation procedure is provided by the @xmath94-dependence of the signature function @xmath161 $ ] of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitphase ] ) that allows for the smooth transition from the pure - signature case to the two limiting cases of adding or subtracting degenerate trajectories and thus , again , lets the data decide which description is better suited for a given application .",
    "one should point out that fixing local gauge invariance as presented here does not imply that the resulting expressions will automatically provide good results for the problem at hand .",
    "it merely means that whatever is missing for a good description will not be due to violation of local gauge invariance . in other words ,",
    "anything that should be found lacking as far as reproducing of data is concerned would necessarily be resulting from manifestly transverse current mechanisms not relevant for local gauge invariance .    the locally gauge - invariant reggeization procedure outlined here is currently being applied to describe jefferson lab data  @xcite for @xmath162 at photon energies between 1.5 and 2.5 gev .",
    "the preliminary results are encouraging ; the full report will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention once more that the procedure given here can also be used for the reggeization of the @xmath8-channel in terms of baryonic regge trajectories . with the details given here",
    ", it should be quite obvious how to implement this for the @xmath8-channel in a locally gauge - invariant manner ( see also footnote [ foot : schannel ] ) .",

    "this contact current is manifestly nonsingular since the form factors become unity at the respective poles thus providing well - defined @xmath87 situations .",
    "the function @xmath169 is an arbitrary ( complex ) phenomenological function , possibly subject to crossing symmetry constraints , that must vanish at high energies .",

    "( [ eq : cauxgeneric ] ) is easily seen to be manifestly transverse in view of the charge - conservation relation ( [ eq : conscharge ] ) and therefore not necessary for preserving local gauge invariance .",
    "however , it provides added flexibility when fitting data . in principle , of course , any transverse ( nonsingular ) current may be added to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : mintgeneric ] ) without affecting gauge invariance .",

    "we mention without going into much detail here that one may generalize the vertex ( [ eq : modelvertex ] ) by employing an expansion of the form @xmath175 where the sum extends over all possible coupling operators @xmath176 , each with its own ( normalized ) form factor @xmath177 such that the mixing parameters @xmath178 add up to unity , @xmath179 in principle , one may even consider a formulation where the scalar functions @xmath177 are no longer phenomenological suppression functions , but are determined within a consistent dynamical framework . depending on the sophistication of this framework , the expansion ( [ eq : genvertex ] ) then may be made arbitrarily close to a complete dynamical description for the three - point vertex @xmath180 .    to accommodate the combination vertex ( [ eq : genvertex ] ) with more than one coupling operators @xmath176 , one needs bare currents @xmath181 for each one satisfying a separate gwti like ( [ eq : gwtiintbare ] ) and leading to , in particular , @xmath182 the analog of the interaction current ansatz ( [ eq : mintgeneric ] ) then is @xmath183~,\\ ] ] where @xmath184 is the form factor @xmath177 in the @xmath0-channel and @xmath185 is like ( [ eq : cauxgeneric ] ) using @xmath177 alone .",
