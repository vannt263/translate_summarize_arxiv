    "0.6truecm the publication of the first results of the kamland experiment marks the beginning of a new era in the studies of neutrino mixing and oscillations - the era of high precision determination of the neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "the data obtained by the solar neutrino experiments homestake , kamiokande , sage , gallex / gno and super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite provided the first strong evidences for oscillations of flavour ( electron ) neutrinos .",
    "strong evidences for oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) neutrinos were obtained by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment @xcite . the evidences for solar @xmath4 oscillations into active neutrinos @xmath33 ,",
    "were significantly reinforced during the last two years i ) by the combined first data of the sno experiment @xcite , and the sk data @xcite , ii ) by the more recent sno neutral current data @xcite , and iii ) by the first results of the kamland @xcite experiment .",
    "the kamland data practically establishes @xcite , under the plausible assumption of cpt - invariance , the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution as unique solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "this result brings us , after more than 30 years of research , initiated by the pioneer works of b. pontecorvo @xcite and the experiment of r. davis et al .",
    "@xcite , very close to a complete understanding of the true cause of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the interpretation of the solar and atmospheric neutrino , and of the kamland data in terms of neutrino oscillations requires the existence of 3-neutrino mixing in the weak charged lepton current ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are the three left - handed flavor neutrino fields , @xmath37 is the left - handed field of the neutrino @xmath38 having a mass @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix @xcite , @xmath41    where we have used a standard parametrization of @xmath40 with the usual notations , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the dirac cp - violation phase .. ] if we identify @xmath45 and @xmath46 with the neutrino mass squared differences which drive the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , the data suggest that @xmath49 . in this case @xmath50 and @xmath12 , represent the neutrino mixing angles responsible for the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , while @xmath11 is the angle limited by the data from the chooz and palo verde experiments @xcite .",
    "combined @xmath53 and @xmath54 oscillation analyses of the solar neutrino and kamland @xcite data , performed under the assumption of cpt - invariance which we will suppose to hold throughout this study , show @xcite that the data favor the lma msw solution with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . a second ,",
    "statistically somewhat less favored lma solution ( lma ii ) exists at @xcite @xmath57 .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino data , as is well known , is best described @xcite in terms of dominant @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) oscillations with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the 90% c.l . allowed intervals of values of the two - neutrino oscillation parameters found in @xcite read @xmath62 and @xmath63 . according to the more recent combined analysis of the data from the sk and k2k experiments @xcite , one has @xmath64 .",
    "we will often use in our analysis as illustrative the values @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "let us note that the atmospheric neutrino and k2k data do not allow one to determine the signs of @xmath67 , and of @xmath68 when @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that in the case of 3-neutrino mixing one can have @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the two possibilities correspond to two different types of neutrino mass spectrum : with normal hierarchy ( nh ) , @xmath70 , and with inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , @xmath71 .",
    "the fact that the sign of @xmath68 is not determined when @xmath69 implies that when , e.g. , @xmath72 , two values of @xmath10 are possible , @xmath73 .    in what regards the mixing angle @xmath11 , a 3-@xmath74 oscillation analysis of the chooz data @xcite led to the conclusion that for @xmath75 , the limits on @xmath9 practically coincide with those derived in the 2-@xmath74 oscillation analysis in @xcite . a combined 3-@xmath74 oscillation analysis of the solar neutrino , chooz and the kamland data , performed under the assumption of @xmath76 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , showed @xcite that @xmath77 at 99.73% c.l .",
    "the authors of @xcite found the best - fit value of @xmath9 to lie in the interval @xmath78 .",
    "getting more precise information about the value of the mixing angle @xmath11 , determining the sign of @xmath67 , or the type of the neutrino mass spectrum ( with normal or inverted hierarchy ) , and measuring the value of @xmath10 with a higher precision is of fundamental importance for the progress in the studies of neutrino mixing .    the mixing angle @xmath11 , or the absolute value of the element @xmath79 of the pmns matrix , @xmath80 , plays a very important role in the phenomenology of the 3-neutrino oscillations .",
    "it drives the sub - dominant @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath11 controls also the @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 transitions in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ( minos , cngs ) , and in the widely discussed very long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments at neutrino factories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude of the t - violating and cp - violating probabilities in neutrino oscillations is directly proportional to @xmath87 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the sub - dominant channels of interest to t- and cp - violation studies , the corresponding asymmetries become proportional to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath89 is thus of prime importance .",
    "if the neutrinos with definite mass are majorana particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the predicted value of the effective majorana mass parameter in neutrinoless double @xmath90decay depends strongly in the case of hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum on the value of @xmath9 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath67 determines , for instance , which of the transitions ( e.g. , of atmospheric neutrinos ) @xmath83 and @xmath85 , or @xmath84 and @xmath86 , can be enhanced by the earth matter effects @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the neutrino effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double @xmath90decay depend critically on the type of the neutrino mass spectrum ( normal or inverted hierarchical ) @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the value of @xmath11 and of the sign of @xmath48 is crucial for the searches for the correct theory of neutrino masses and mixing as well .",
    "somewhat better limits on @xmath91 than the existing one can be obtained in the minos experiment @xcite .",
    "various options are being currently discussed ( experiments with off - axis neutrino beams , more precise reactor antineutrino and long base - line experiments , etc . ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite ) of how to improve by at least an order of magnitude , i.e. , to values of @xmath92 or smaller , the sensitivity to @xmath9 . the sign of @xmath67 can be determined in very long base - line neutrino oscillation experiments at neutrino factories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and , e.g , using combined data from long base - line oscillation experiments at the jhf facility and with off - axis neutrino beams @xcite .",
    "if the neutrinos with definite mass are majorana particles , it can be determined by measuring the effective neutrino majorana mass in neutrinoless double @xmath90decay experiments @xcite . under certain rather special conditions",
    "it might be determined also in experiments with reactor @xmath5 @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we study possibilities to obtain information on the value of @xmath9 and on the sign of @xmath48 using the atmospheric neutrino data , accumulated by the sk experiment , and more generally , that can be provided by future water - erenkov detectors , like uno and hyper - kamiokande .",
    "we consider 3-neutrino oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 under the condition latexmath:[${\\mbox{$",
    "\\delta m^2_{\\odot}$}}= \\delta m^2_{21 } \\ll     suggested to hold by the current solar and atmospheric neutrino data . under the indicated condition ,",
    "the expressions for the probabilities of @xmath83 ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath84 ( @xmath86 ) transitions contain @xmath10 as a factor , which determines their maximal values .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath46 , the earth matter effects can resonantly enhance either the @xmath83 and @xmath85 , or the @xmath84 and @xmath94 transitions if @xmath95",
    ". the effects of the enhancement can be substantial for @xmath96 .",
    "they are larger in the multi - gev @xmath97-like and @xmath2like samples of events and for atmospheric neutrinos with relatively large path length in the earth , crossing deeply the mantle @xcite or the mantle and the core @xcite , i.e. , for @xmath19 , where @xmath0 is the nadir angle characterizing the neutrino trajectory in the earth .",
    "the @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) transitions in the earth lead to the reduction of the rate of the multi - gev @xmath2like events and to the increase of the rate of the multi - gev @xmath3like events in the super - kamiokande ( or any other water - erenkov ) detector with respect to the case of absence of these transitions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . correspondingly , as observables which are sensitive to the earth matter effects , and thus to the value of @xmath9 and the sign of @xmath46 , as well as to @xmath10 , we consider the nadir - angle distributions of the ratios @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 and are the multi - gev @xmath2like and @xmath97-like numbers of events ( or event rates ) in the case of 3-@xmath74 oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath102 is the number of @xmath3like events in the case of absence of oscillations ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the ratio of the energy and nadir angle integrated @xmath2like and @xmath3like events , @xmath1 , has been measured with a relatively high precision by the sk experiment @xcite . the systematic uncertainty , in particular , in the nadir angle dependence of the ratio @xmath1 can be smaller than those on the measured nadir angle distributions of @xmath2like and @xmath3like events , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we obtain predictions for the nadir - angle distributions of @xmath98 and of @xmath99 both for neutrino mass spectra with normal ( @xmath15 ) and inverted ( @xmath16 ) hierarchy , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and for @xmath109 .",
    "we compare the latter with the predicted nadir - angle distributions i ) of the ratio @xmath110 for the case the 3-neutrino oscillations taking place in vacuum , @xmath111 , and ii ) of the ratio @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the predicted number of @xmath2like events in the case of 2-neutrino @xmath58 and @xmath59 oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "predictions for the different types of ratios indicated above of the suitably integrated nadir angle distributions of the @xmath2like and @xmath3like multi - gev events are also given .",
    "our results show , in particular , that for @xmath27 @xmath17 and @xmath15 , the effects of the earth matter enhanced @xmath83 and @xmath85 transitions of the atmospheric @xmath31 and @xmath4 , might be observable with the super - kamiokande detector .",
    "conversely , if the indicated effects are indeed observed in the super - kamiokande experiment , that would suggest in turn that @xmath17 , @xmath27 and that the neutrino mass spectrum is with normal hierarchy , @xmath15 .",
    "let us note finally that the earth matter effects have been widely investigated ( for a recent detailed study see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite which contains also a rather complete list of references to earlier work on the subject ) .",
    "however , the study of the magnitude of the earth matter effects in the nadir angle distribution of the ratio of the multi - gev @xmath2like and @xmath3like events , measured in water - erenkov detectors , performed here overlaps very little with the earlier investigations .",
    "0.6truecm in the present section we summarize the results on the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos crossing the earth , which we use in our analysis .",
