    "the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions and quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is approaching its zenith with the first experiments performed at the large hadron collider at cern geneva ( though not yet at the top energy ) involving lead nuclei . together with the wealth of data already accumulated at the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory",
    ", we now have an enormous task to decipher , analyze , and quantitatively explain these observations and extract information about the properties of the qgp .",
    "these analyses are also paving the way for additional measurements , some of which can already be performed using the present detector set - ups , while others will become amenable to studies with the upgrades planned for all the major experiments , alice , phenix , and star , etc .",
    "taken in its entirety , this represents the most important and fruitful international collaboration in high energy nuclear physics to date .",
    "the focus has now progressed from models to theories and from qualitative to quantitative determination of various properties of quark gluon plasma .",
    "enormous strides made towards exploring the shear viscosity  @xcite of the matter produced in these collisions is one such example .    in the present work we consider using heavy quarks to probe the qgp .",
    "the heavy quarks ( only charm and bottom quarks are considered here ) offer several unique advantages .",
    "the conservation of flavour in strong interaction dictates that they are produced in pairs @xmath5 .",
    "their large mass provides that @xmath6 necessary for their production is large and thus one may confidently use pqcd , for these studies .",
    "their large masses ensure that the hadrons containing the heavy quarks stand out in the swarm of pions .",
    "their large mass also provides that , even though buffeted by light quarks and gluons during their passage through the quark gluon plasma , the direction of their motion may not change substantially .",
    "this should make them a valuable probe for the properties of the plasma which depend on the reaction plane .",
    "our understanding of the effect of the dead cone  @xcite on the suppression of radiation has undergone quite some evolution since it was proposed earlier .",
    "it is also not yet clearly established that heavy quarks will completely thermalize in the plasma formed at rhic and lhc energies ( see ref .",
    ". however it must be safe to assume that the drag  @xcite suffered by heavy quarks will mostly slow it down and the so - called diffusion  @xcite processes will not alter its direction considerably .",
    "thus , the azimuthal correlation of heavy quarks integrated over @xmath7 may be reasonably immune to the energy loss suffered by them .",
    "the heavy quarks could be influenced by the flow  @xcite generated in such collisions .",
    "if this is true , then a very interesting situation may arise for heavy quarks which is not possible for light quarks or gluons .",
    "consider a @xmath0 pair produced in a central collision having @xmath8 . at leading order",
    ", their transverse momenta would be equal in magnitude and point towards opposite directions .",
    "consider a heavy quark q moving away from the centre with momentum @xmath9 .",
    "then its partner @xmath10 would move with momentum @xmath11 towards the centre .",
    "their velocities would be @xmath12 @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the mass of the heavy quark . let the radial flow velocity be @xmath16 .",
    "now if @xmath17 , the @xmath10 will turn back and start moving away from the centre ! thus the @xmath0 pair , which should have appeared back - to - back would appear as moving in the same direction .",
    "this would drastically alter the azimuthal correlation of the pair . a similar change of direction of motion is not possible for light quarks and gluons as they move with the speed of light .",
    "taking , for example , @xmath18 0.6 , ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) one can see that the azimuthal correlation of charm quarks for @xmath19 1.2 gev and for bottom quarks having @xmath19 3.5 gev could be considerably modified from their primordial value . recalling that non - back - to - back heavy quarks are produced from nlo processes ( see later also ) , this would introduce an interesting richness in these studies",
    ".         now consider charm quarks ( say ) produced from the primary processes @xmath20 at leading order and @xmath21 at next - to - leading order . in the absence of any intrinsic @xmath22 for partons , the quarks from the first process will be produced back - to - back , while those from the second process will be mostly collinear and will additionally be accompanied with a recoiling parton .",
    "a comparison of the energy loss suffered by the recoiling parton and the heavy - quarks will allow us to obtain flavour dependence of the energy loss . a considerable richness to this picture",
    "is added by the realization that the splitting @xmath23 , would produce collinear heavy quarks , while the process @xmath24 , where a gluon is radiated by one of the heavy quarks will essentially give rise to a flat azimuthal correlation .",
    "so far we have discussed only the azimuthal correlation of the heavy quarks .",
    "a study of the transverse momentum of the pair and the rapidity - difference of the pair can help us disentangle the lo and the nlo processes . recall that the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 pair would be identically zero at lo and equal to that of the recoiling parton at nlo .",
    "deviations from the results for @xmath1 collisions at the corresponding centre of mass energy in nuclear collisions will provide a measure of medium modifications as usual .",
    "the entire discussion so far assumes that there may be no additional production of heavy quarks after the initial prompt production .",
    "often this production for @xmath1 collisions is taken as a baseline for the study of nuclear modification factor @xmath25 .",
    "it is obvious that any additional production of heavy quarks , for example due to multiple scattering of high momentum quarks and gluons produced similarly , see refs .",
    "@xcite or due to passage of a high energy quarks or gluons through the qgp  @xcite , or due to scattering among the thermalized partons , if the temperature is sufficiently large  @xcite , will necessitate revision of our estimates for the energy loss suffered by heavy quarks as they traverse the qgp , obtained by analyzing the nuclear modification function @xmath25 , ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "by now there is also a growing realization that @xmath25 is not able to seriously discriminate between different mechanisms of energy loss and evolution of the system  @xcite and the correlation of the leading hadrons are slowly emerging as more discerning probes  @xcite .",
    "consider a simple example .",
    "we need to know the transverse momentum of heavy quarks in @xmath1 collisions in order to have a base - line to estimate the nuclear modifications .",
    "the nlo pqcd results for these are easily approximated by a @xmath26 factor multiplying the results for lo pqcd ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . now consider the azimuthal correlations of heavy quarks produced in similar collisions . as we discussed above",
    ", the lo pqcd results for the correlation is a delta function around @xmath27 .",
    "however , we shall see that the correlation function estimated at nlo , though still peaking at @xmath27 fills up the phase - space from zero to @xmath28 with an interesting catenary like structure",
    ". considering that one uses deviations from @xmath1 collisions to obtain results for nuclear modifications , these will have to be quantitatively understood for @xmath1 collisions before we can accurately decipher the later .",
    "the present work aims at investigating azimuthal , momentum , and rapidity correlations for heavy quark - anti quark pairs for @xmath1 collisions and setting the stage for the study of the deviations in these due to medium modifications in heavy ion collisions at the corresponding energies .",
    "we also discuss the complexities arising from the additional production of heavy quarks due to multiple scatterings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss various correlations for @xmath1 collisions using nlo pqcd . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the azimuthal correlations in pb+pb collisions due to initial production and various multiple collisions .",
    "our results for @xmath1 and pb+pb collisions are discussed in sect .",
    "4 followed by conclusion in sect . 5",
    "the results for particle and photon productions in @xmath1 collisions serve as a baseline in search for quark - gluon - plasma and other medium effects at the corresponding centre of mass energy / nucleon for collision of heavy nuclei .",
    "this paradigm may have to be modified if the recent suggestions for formation of qgp ( perhaps only in high multiplicity events ) , ref .",
    "@xcite in @xmath1 collisions turn out to be valid .",
    "an alternative criterion of comparing results for peripheral collisions to those for central collisions has also been used with considerable success , with the understanding that the peripheral collisions may be considered as a superposition of @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the correlation of heavy quarks produced in @xmath1 collisions is defined in general as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the rapidities of heavy quark and anti - quark and @xmath32 are their transverse momenta .    at the leading order",
    ", the differential cross - section for the charm correlation from proton - proton collision can be written as : @xmath33    in the above @xmath34 and @xmath35 /(1+\\delta_{ij})~ , \\label{ini}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the fractions of the momenta carried by the partons from their interacting parent hadrons .",
    "these are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the transverse mass , @xmath40 , of the produced heavy quark .",
    "the subscripts @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the interacting partons , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the partonic distribution functions for the nucleons .",
    "we shall use cteq5 m structure function , though we have checked that similar results are obtained for other modern structure functions ( see later ) .",
    "the differential cross - section for partonic interactions , @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the invariant amplitude for different sub - processes as obtained from ref .",
    "the physical sub - processes included for the leading order , @xmath2 @xmath48 production of heavy quarks are : @xmath49    at next - to - leading order , @xmath2 @xmath50 subprocesses included are as follows @xmath51    we show our results for azimuthal correlation @xmath52 , where @xmath53=@xmath54 as well as rapidity correlations , @xmath55 , where @xmath56=@xmath57 , of produced heavy quarks .",
    "we also present @xmath58 correlations in the jet radius parameter , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 along with the transverse momentum , invariant mass , and rapidity of the pair .",
    "we verify the accuracy of our results by evaluating the production of @xmath4 and charm measured recently .",
    "let us now move towards pb+pb collisions under study at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "we have discussed that most of the heavy - quarks and so also quarks and gluons having large transverse momenta are produced in initial hard collisions . at the energies reached at the lhc , the sheer number of quarks and gluons produced in these collisions leads to vehement multiple collisions and gluon multiplication .",
    "this then leads to a quark - gluon plasma at a very large initial temperature .    as discussed earlier , we would like to know if these initial temperatures are large enough to produce heavy quarks as well ( see eg . ref .",
    "the multiple collisions among the very high momentum quarks and gluons ( the so called jet - jet collisions ) have been seen earlier to produce substantial number of heavy quarks .",
    "these jets , produced at very early times @xmath61 will have to necessarily pass through the qgp which will be formed only after @xmath62 0.1 fm/@xmath63 .",
    "do these lead to a substantial production of heavy quarks ?",
    "some of these questions have been addressed earlier  @xcite .    since those early studies ,",
    "several new developments have taken place .",
    "we now know the particle rapidly density ( see eg . ref .",
    "@xcite ) , important to calculate the initial conditions , for which only values estimated by several authors were known earlier .",
    "there has , now , been a growing realization that jet - quenching measured in terms of the nuclear modification function @xmath64 is not able to seriously discriminate between various theories of evolution of the plasma and the mechanism of energy loss .",
    "thus correlations are being studied more closely to help us in this enterprise .",
    "thus we extend our earlier study  @xcite to explore the correlations of heavy quarks in collision of heavy nuclei due to initial production and various multiple collisions , e.g. , jet - jet interactions , jet - plasma interactions , and the scattering of thermal partons , to see if these processes make large contribution to the correlation .",
    "this is important as , at least the jet - jet collision was found to make a large contribution to the production of heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "the basic formulation which gives the correlation of produced heavy quarks from initial fusion of gluons and quark - anti quark annihilation in proton - proton collision is given by eq .",
    "thus the azimuthal distribution of heavy quark for pb+pb collision at @xmath65 is given by @xmath66    for central collisions of lead nuclei , the nuclear thickness function is taken as @xmath67= 292 @xmath68 . in the above @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the momenta of the heavy quarks produced .",
    "the initial hard scattering will produce massless gluons and light quarks in large numbers .",
    "these partons have large transverse momenta .",
    "these quarks and gluons may ultimately thermalize because of frequent interactions among themselves and if sufficient energy is available , their interactions may lead to the production of heavy quarks as well . here",
    "we give the formulation for azimuthal distribution of produced heavy quarks pair from jet - jet interaction .",
    "since the jet - jet contribution to the heavy quark production is comparable to that of primary production  @xcite , it should be interesting to see if their azimuthal distributions differ .    as a first step we obtain the distribution of light partons , having @xmath7 @xmath71 2 gev , from a lo pqcd calculation using cteq5 m structure function , for @xmath1 collisions at 2.76 tev and 5.5 tev .",

    "recoiling parton in the case of heavy ion collisions can give interesting details of how heavy quarks and ( mostly ) gluons behave in the medium produced in the collision .",
    "these results also contain a very interesting situation .",
    "consider a heavy - quark produced in lo pqcd in a nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "they will be produced back - to - back and are most likely to cover different part and length of the system , before they fragment ( or coalesce with a light quark ) to form a d - meson .",
    "thus they would lose a differing amount of energy and acquire a net - transverse momentum which was initially identically zero .",
    "at least the co - linear heavy - quarks produced during splitting of a off - shell gluon would , on the other hand , cover similar distances under similar conditions in the plasma , and thus their net transverse momentum will remain largely unaltered",
    ". it would be interesting to study such cases in future more detailed experiments .",
    "we show our results for rapidity correlation where , @xmath156 , of heavy quarks produced in such collisions in fig .",
    "we note that this correlation peaks at vanishing rapidity difference .",
    "we have also given the lo results for this along with a scaling of the lo results with a factor @xmath157 to demonstrate that the nlo results can not , in general , be approximated by a @xmath26 factor multiplying the lo results , and the inadequacy of this shows up most strongly near @xmath56 equal to zero .",
    "it is also likely that the rapidity difference , specially when the two rapidities have opposite signs may encode effects of longitudinal flow in case of nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "[ r ] shows the results of our calculation for the jet - radius , @xmath59 , correlation , where @xmath158 .",
    "it brings out the interesting differences between results for the leading order and next - to - leading calculations .",
    "thus , while at leading order we do not have any contribution for r @xmath159 , there is a substantial contribution coming from next - to - leading processes for 0 @xmath160 r @xmath160 @xmath28 .",
    "now we proceed to our results for collision of lead nuclei at 2.76 atev and 5.5 atev . in fig .",
    "[ azipbini ] we show our results for azimuthal distribution of heavy quarks produced from initial ( prompt ) collision of partons , having transverse momenta of 14 gev and rapidities close to zero .",
    "the results for lo calculations , having a peak at @xmath161 are given , to demonstrate the importance of using nlo results as a base line for these studies .",
    "we see a sharpening of the collinear and back - to - back correlations as the momenta of the quarks increases , while the correlation , with the exception of the peak at @xmath161 , gets more flat , as nlo processes have a larger role , as the available energy increases .",
    "we also find less production of pairs of bottom quarks with smaller @xmath162 at the same energy , compared to charm quarks , as expected .",
    "we show our results for production of heavy quarks from multiple scattering of jets in fig .",
    "[ azipbjet ] .",
    "we have limited our calculations to contributions from quarks and gluons having @xmath76 2 gev .",
    "let us first consider our results for charm quarks .",
    "at both the energies , we see that while charm quarks having transverse momenta around 1.5 gev , show a correlation which rises smoothly as we go from collinear to back - to - back correlations , the charm - quarks having larger transverse momenta give rise to a flat distribution for larger @xmath162 .",
    "we also note that the contribution of multiple scattering of the jets , even though smaller at @xmath163 compared to the contribution of initial production , is rather comparable at smaller angular separations .",
    "we note that as the initial and the final times @xmath90 and @xmath91 appear only as a multiplicative factor @xmath104 , the shape the correlation will remain unaffected by any change in their value .",
    "the bottom quarks show a very interesting trend . for the lowest momentum considered ,",
    "the bottom - quarks are seen to be produced with a flat azimuthal correlation , while as their momenta increase , the distribution becomes more and more collinear .",
    "the observation about comparable contributions of multiple scattering of jets and initial production at @xmath164 , seen earlier for charm quarks , applies to them as well .",
    "the results for the angular correlations of heavy quarks produced from the passage of jets through qgp are shown in fig .",
    "[ azipbjetth ] .",
    "a very interesting and distinct picture emerges for these heavy quarks .",
    "we see that these productions are dominated by collinear contributions , confirming the nomenclature `` jet - conversion '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for them . at small",
    "@xmath53 their contribution is similar to that from initial production .",
    "the corresponding results for bottom quark - pairs show similar trends , but those are an order of magnitude smaller than the contribution of initial production .    and finally the results for the angular correlation of heavy quarks produced from scattering of thermalized partons is shown in fig .  [ azipbth ] .",
    "firstly , these contributions are smaller by more an order of magnitude than the contributions discussed above .",
    "however , we still discuss their features as these are quite interesting .",
    "the azimuthal correlation of charm as well as bottom quark pairs is rather flat for low transverse momenta but changes steadily to back - to - back at the transverse momentum increases .",
    "this , we feel , happens as heavy quarks having large transverse momenta can only come from collisions of partons having large @xmath117 .",
    "this would be possible for partons having almost equal and opposite momenta , thus leading to heavy quarks which will be predominantly back - to - back .    in order to get a feeling of the relative contributions of different mechanisms",
    ", we have shown the correlation of charm quarks for @xmath165 2 gev/@xmath63 and 4 gev/@xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ compare ] .",
    "the first thing we note is that the shapes and relative contributions of the processes under consideration remain unchanged with the change in the momentum .",
    "next we note that the multiple scattering among the high energy gluons and quarks , termed jet - jet interaction , givesi rise to a rather flat azimuthal correlation between the charm quarks , which is comparable to the results for prompt production for @xmath166 .",
    "the next large contribution is due to the jet - thermal contribution , which is rather flat for @xmath167 $ ] and then falls rapidly . over this region",
    "it is again comparable to the prompt and the jet - thermal contributions .",
    "the thermal contributions are peaked toward @xmath168 and are rather small .",
    "recall that we have used a formation time of the plasma as 0.1 fm/@xmath63 , inspired by the parton saturation model . a larger value for @xmath90 will leave the jet - jet contribution essentially unchanged , as we discussed earlier",
    ". however the jet - thermal and thermal contributions are expected to drop if the initial time is increased . thus recalling our results from ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate that raising the @xmath90 to 0.5 fm/@xmath63 the jet - thermal contribution may decrease by a factor of 2 , while the thermal contribution will come down by a factor of about 4 .",
    "we have suggested earlier that the effect of drag or energy loss of heavy quarks alone may not be enough to change their direction of motion , and thus the @xmath7-integrated azimuthal correlations discussed in this work may not be affected by the energy loss .",
    "it may change for a given @xmath7 due to migration of quarks to the regions of lower @xmath7 and the @xmath7 dependence of the heavy quark production .",
    "the flow of the medium can , however , affect the angular correlation considerably , if it is large and if the heavy quarks are thermalized . in order to estimate the effect of the flow on the correlation of the heavy quarks , we use a toy model used earlier by cuautle and paic  @xcite , and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , for studying correlations .    in order to do this ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we first give a random orientation to the quark - pairs from the nlo pqcd calculations ( the nlo mnr code , e.g. , at lo gives pairs with @xmath169=0 ) .",
    "then we place them at @xmath170 , randomly chosen according to the probability : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the transverse density profile of the nucleus @xmath41 assumed to have a uniform density of radius @xmath59 , and @xmath173 is the nuclear thickness for impact parameter , @xmath65 . assuming a flow , directed away from the centre",
    ", we add the flow momentum @xmath174= @xmath175 ( @xmath105/@xmath176 ) to the momentum of the heavy quark @xmath9 .",
    "we use the blast - model  @xcite to write @xmath175 as @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "we give results for @xmath180 0 , 0.3 , and 0.6 .",
    "we show our results fig .",
    "[ flow1 ] for two ranges of @xmath7 of the charm quarks , @xmath181 4 gev and @xmath76 4 gev .",
    "we see that even though the azimuthal correlation is more strongly affected for charm quarks having lower transverse momenta for reasonable values of the flow , the basic nature of the correlation function remains unchanged .",
    "it is likely that if the charm quarks are not completely thermalized , the effective flow velocity for them could be smaller , and then the above observation becomes even more relevant .",
    "note that large values of @xmath182 are normally reached only in the hadronic phase .",
    "we have calculated azimuthal , rapidity difference , and transverse momentum correlations of heavy quark pairs produced in @xmath1 collisions at several energies relevant for experiments being done at the large hadron collider , using nlo pqcd . where - ever possible ,",
    "we have discussed how these could change due to final state effects in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "these results will act as a base - line for similar studies in the case of @xmath183 collisions at the corresponding centre of mass energies / nucleon , to determine medium modifications .",
    "we have noted that this picture is enriched ( or complicated ) by multiple collisions among the partons having high energy , which can give very different correlations of a magnitude comparable to that of initial productions considered above . we have argued , but it remains to be verified , that these correlations may not be drastically altered due to the energy loss suffered by heavy quarks , as they may not change the direction of their motion substantially , due to soft scatterings . these may however , be affected by a strong flow of the medium , if the heavy quarks are thermalized .    in a forth - coming publication",
    "we shall address the issue of consequences of energy loss on these correlations .",
