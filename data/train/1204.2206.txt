    "discrete symmetries play an important role in particle physics . apart from the fundamental space  time symmetries @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , there are various well known examples such as the so  called matter or @xmath9 parity in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ". there are good reasons for using discrete rather than continuous symmetries .",
    "models with spontaneously broken global continuous symmetries exhibit goldstone bosons which are typically phenomenologically unacceptable .",
    "moreover , there are strong arguments that a continuous symmetry has either to be gauged or it will be broken by quantum gravity effects ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "in contrast to the fundamental symmetries , discrete symmetries are often just imposed by hand for phenomenological reasons .",
    "while introducing such symmetries can be a useful tool in bottom  up model building it appears worthwhile to clarify the origin of a given symmetry . given a deeper understanding of how such symmetries arise , one might be able to obtain a more fundamental understanding of observations , such as the repetition of families and the flavor structure .",
    "discrete symmetries come in various classes .",
    "various generation  dependent flavor symmetries , have been proposed in order to explain the pattern of quark and lepton yukawa couplings , and to control higher  dimensional operators ( see e.g.  @xcite for a quite recent review and other contributions of this special issue @xcite for more references ) .",
    "apart from these there are generation  independent symmetries , introduced in order to cure certain shortcomings of extensions of the standard model such as the mssm .",
    "for example , dangerous proton decay operators are forbidden by matter parity @xcite , baryon triality @xcite , proton hexality @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "further , discrete symmetries of high order can manifest themselves as accidental global @xmath11 symmetries in the ( truncated ) low  energy effective theory .",
    "such accidental symmetries can be used for example in two ways : as ( anomalous ) peccei  quinn symmetry addressing the strong cp problem ( cf .  the discussion in @xcite ) or as a @xmath12 explaining the hierarchy between the planck and the electroweak scales  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this review is to clarify the origin of discrete symmetries .",
    "they can be obtained from continuous symmetries by spontaneous breaking .",
    "but this is not the only possibility .",
    "in fact , here we mainly focus on alternative possibilities for the origin of discrete symmetries . in section [ sec : geometricalorigin ] we discuss , in the framework of field theory , how discrete symmetries can be related to the geometry of extra dimensions .",
    "the discussion of higher  dimensional quantum field theories leaves certain questions unanswered .",
    "we therefore change gear and present a top  down derivation of discrete symmetries in section  [ sec : heteroticorbifolds ] , focusing mainly on heterotic orbifolds , as they provide us with explicit candidate models for a uv completion of the standard model , and , at the same time , allow for a cft description and hence for a detailed understanding of the symmetries .",
    "as we shall see , the top  down settings are more restrictive than the bottom  up models .",
    "some of the restrictions can be thought of as originating from the requirement of anomaly freedom , which we discuss separately in section  [ sec : anomalyfreedom ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our discussion in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we present three possible origins of discrete symmetries . after briefly summarizing the standard approach and its limitations in section  [ sec : znfromu1 ] ,",
    "we discuss how to obtain a discrete symmetry from extra dimensions , either as the symmetry of compact space ( section  [ sec : geometryfamily ] ) or as a remnant of higher dimensional lorentz symmetry ( section  [ sec : geometryr ] ) .",
    "the perhaps most straightforward possibility for obtaining a discrete symmetry is by spontaneous breaking of a continuous gauge symmetry . as a simple example , consider a @xmath11 gauge group broken by the vev of a scalar @xmath13 with charge @xmath14 .",
    "here we normalize the 1 such that the charges are integer and have no common divisor .",
    "the unbroken symmetry is given by those @xmath11 transformations that leave the vacuum invariant , i.e.@xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the ( local ) @xmath11 is broken to a ( local ) @xmath17 subgroup .",
    "the extension of this discussion to the case of multiple 1 factors which get broken by several vevs is given in @xcite .",
    "one may also get non  abelian discrete symmetries by spontaneous breaking ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , this typically involves very large representations of the corresponding continuous symmetry , which often give rise to unwanted states in the broken phase .",
    "therefore , arguably , this possibility appears not to be too attractive . in",
    "what follows , we therefore discuss alternative possibilities in which the discrete symmetries are related to the geometry of compact dimensions .",
    "as we shall see , this scheme does not suffer from the above problems , and is realized in explicit string  derived models of particle physics .",
    "discrete family symmetries can be motivated in settings with extra compact dimensions .",
    "it is not surprising that such models offer an explanation for the appearance of non  abelian discrete flavor symmetries , because the latter are symmetries of certain geometrical solids , which describe the compact dimensions .",
    "the symmetries of internal space govern the interactions between fields that are localized in the compact dimensions and may eventually become flavor symmetries .",
    "the purpose of this subsection is to explain that ( non  abelian ) family symmetries can , to some extent , be understood geometrically .",
    "let us start with a very simple example with one extra compact dimension , the orbifold @xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : s1overz2 ] ) . see appendix  [ sec : appendixa1 ] for a brief introduction to the construction of orbifolds .",
    "points which are related by a reflection on the dashed line are identified .",
    "the fundamental region of the orbifold is an interval with the fixed points sitting at the boundaries . ]",
    "this orbifold possesses two geometrically equivalent fixed points .",
    "suppose there are two states , i.e.  two families of quarks and/or leptons , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with identical quantum numbers , one of them localized at each of the fixed points . since the fixed points and the states @xmath21 are geometrically indistinguishable , there is an @xmath22 permutation symmetry relating them , which manifests itself as a symmetry of the theory .",
    "a somewhat more complex example is the tetrahedron in two extra compact dimensions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which can be obtained from the @xmath23 orbifold ( figure  [ fig : tetrahedron ] ) . here",
    "the subscript @xmath24 indicates that the basic translations defining the @xmath25 torus enjoy the same relations as the simple roots of the lie algebra of 3 , i.e.  enclose @xmath26 and have equal lengths .    clearly , the tetrahedron is invariant under a discrete rotation by @xmath26 about an axis that goes through one corner and hits the opposite surface orthogonally .",
    "there are four operations of this type represented by @xmath27 in the basis where each of the four corners is represented by a four  dimensional vector @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 . furthermore ,    [ eq : sandsprime ] @xmath31    with the standard pauli matrix @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath8 generates a @xmath33 and @xmath34 generates a @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , one may allow for orientation  changing operations ( with @xmath36 ) , for example , generated by @xmath37 .    since these generators do not commute , the multiplicative closure yields a non  abelian discrete symmetry , being @xmath38 . as mentioned in @xcite , if one restricts the allowed operations to be contained in proper lorentz transformations , one arrives at the non  abelian flavor symmetry generated by @xmath8 , @xmath34 and @xmath39 , which is @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore arrive at the premature conclusion that , in a model in which each fixed point carries a state , the family symmetry will be @xmath40 .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite and as we shall see later in more detail the actual symmetry in uv complete settings is larger than that .    in summary , we see that extra dimensions offer a compelling explanation of non  abelian discrete flavor symmetries . however , as the settings discussed here are based on gauge theories in more than four dimensions , one has to address the question of how to complete them in the uv .",
    "we will come back to this question in section  [ sec : heteroticorbifolds ] , where we will see that string models indeed often exhibit non  abelian discrete family symmetries .      in supersymmetric theories",
    "there are the so  called @xmath9 symmetries which , by definition , do not commute with supersymmetries .",
    "such symmetries can originate from extra dimensions as well .",
    "specifically they are ( discrete ) remnants of the lorentz symmetry of compact dimensions .",
    "the perhaps simplest way of seeing this is by recalling that under lorentz rotations spinors , vectors and scalars transform differently such that different parts of superfields have different charges .",
    "this means , in particular , that @xmath9 symmetries are deeply connected to the fundamental symmetries of space  time .",
    "let us illustrate this point in more detail by discussing toy  settings with two compact dimensions ( without discussing susy breaking ) .",
    "if these dimensions were flat ( and infinite ) the setup would exhibit an so(2 ) rotation symmetry .",
    "for instance , this symmetry can be defined by its action on the extra components of the gauge fields , @xmath42 since such components get combined to the scalar component of a chiral superfield , describing a bulk field ( or an untwisted sector field in string ",
    "derived orbifolds ) , it is more convenient to recast in complex notation , @xmath43 on the other hand , the spinor component of this ` untwisted superfield ' turns out to transform differently under the lorentz group . to understand this , note that the 4d spinor @xmath44 is contained in the higher  dimensional one ( @xmath45 ) according to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a spinorial zero mode in internal space . recalling that spinors always rotate half as quickly as vectors under lorentz transformations leads to the transformation law @xmath48 in the 4d superfield @xmath49",
    "the superspace coordinates @xmath50 balance the transformations of the components and , i.e.@xmath51 hence , @xmath52 originating from the 6d lorentz symmetry denotes an @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "it is also clear that typically a compact space does not possess the full lorentz symmetry .",
    "for example , orbifolds can have discrete rotational symmetries and hence can naturally provide discrete @xmath9 symmetries , see section  [ sec : stringr ] for more details in the case of string compactifications on orbifolds .",
    "so far , our discussion was purely bottom  up .",
    "it is , however , instructive to comment on the situation in top  down models .",
    "the geometrical repetition of families , as briefly discussed in section  [ sec : geometryfamily ] , is a common feature of most string compactifications .    1 .   in heterotic orbifolds ,",
    "very often families come from so  called twisted sectors , which correspond to states localized at the orbifold fixed points in the extra dimensions .",
    "we will discuss the emergent family symmetries in more detail below .",
    "2 .   in @xmath53brane models ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) the repetition of families is due to the fact that branes can wrap cycles ( i.e.  some directions in the extra dimensions ) multiple times .",
    "therefore , one can have non  trivial intersection numbers between different branes , leading to otherwise equivalent chiral states localized at the intersections .",
    "therefore such models also generically exhibit non ",
    "trivial family symmetries . also @xmath54 theory models have non  trivial family symmetries , which often lead to the problem that the yukawa couplings have rank one @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will focus on the heterotic string compactified on ( toroidal ) orbifolds .",
    "there are two main reasons for this choice .",
    "first of all , the heterotic framework gives rise to explicit globally consistent candidate models for physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "second , at the same time , this scheme is simple enough to fully understand the symmetries .",
    "discrete symmetries can appear mainly in two ways : ( i ) from the compacification to 4d as remnants of higher dimensional gauge / lorentz symmetry and ( ii ) from going to a special vacuum configuration where some of the fields of the 4d effective theory obtain vevs and hence induce further symmetry breaking .",
    "the situation is schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig : origin ] .",
    "symmetries get broken to the 4d super poincar , a 4d gauge and various discrete @xmath9 and non@xmath9 symmetries .",
    "the latter two get further broken to subgroups by non ",
    "trivial vevs of certain charged fields . ]",
    "orbifolds are six  dimensional compact spaces which , in contrast to a general calabi ",
    "yau compactification , have additional discrete symmetries which manifest themselves in the four - dimensional effective theory .",
    "brief introductions to heterotic orbifolds and to the selection rules that govern the allowed terms of the superpotential are given in appendix  [ sec : appendixa ] .",
    "in general , there are two possible origins for abelian ( non@xmath9 ) discrete symmetries in heterotic orbifold compactifications .",
    "either they can arise from the space group selection rule discussed in appendix  [ sec : stringselectionrules ] or as a discrete remnant of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry .",
    "the second possibility was discussed in section  [ sec : znfromu1 ] , the first one will be presented in the following .    for the sake of concreteness , we consider the @xmath55 orbicircle of section  [ sec : geometricalorigin ] . in this case , the space group consists of the elements @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 describe the @xmath59 reflection , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath9 denotes the radius of the circle @xmath62 .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : s1overz2 ] , the integer @xmath63 specifies the location of the twisted state ( or ` brane field ' ) , which have @xmath64 , as opposed to untwisted states ( or ` bulk fields ' ) which have @xmath65 .",
    "the space group selection rule requires the product of space ",
    "group elements of the states involved in a coupling to be congruent to identity ( see appendix  [ sec : stringselectionrules ] ) .",
    "this gives rise to an abelian @xmath66 symmetry , i.e.   @xmath67 we will refer to the condition on @xmath68 as the point group selection rule and to the second one on @xmath69 as the @xmath63rule .",
    "a particularly interesting situation arises if the two fixed points at @xmath70 and @xmath71 are equivalent , which happens to be the case unless one introduces a non  trivial background field ( either a so  called discrete wilson line @xcite or the @xmath72-field ( discrete torsion ) @xcite ) . in this case",
    "there is an additional @xmath22 permutation symmetry that interchanges @xmath70 and @xmath73 .",
    "as we shall discuss now , together with the @xmath66 symmetry discussed above in section  [ sec : abeliansymmetries ] , this leads to a non  abelian discrete symmetry @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we combine a state from the fixed point at @xmath70 and a state from the one at @xmath73 into a two  dimensional vector , i.e.  a doublet . from equation  [ eqn : abelianpartorbicircle ]",
    "we see that the space group selection rule is generated in this basis by the elements @xmath75 i.e.  the element @xmath76 generates @xmath77 , i.e.  the point group selection rule , and @xmath78 generates @xmath79 , i.e.  the @xmath63rule . the additional element that generates the permutation of the two states",
    "is given by @xmath80 the multiplicative closure of these three elements yields a non  abelian group with eight elements @xmath81 and is known as the dihedral group @xmath74 , associated with the symmetry of a square .",
    "similar to the @xmath55 case , the @xmath82 orbifold without wilson lines ( see figure  [ fig : fixedpoints ] ) generically has a @xmath83 flavor symmetry which originates from the abelian space group selection rule @xmath84 combined with the permutation symmetries @xmath34 and @xmath39 of equation  [ eq : sandsprime ] .",
    "it can be enhanced further for special values of the angle and the two radii of @xmath82 .",
    "for example , when the orbifold geometrically is a tetrahedron the naive geometrical @xmath38 symmetry obtained from field theory considerations in section  [ sec : geometryfamily ] gets enhanced to @xmath85 , which has 192 elements , by the stringy space group selection rule @xcite .",
    "if one allows only for proper lorentz transformations , one obtains a group with 96 elements which is contained in @xmath85 .",
    "the string description allows us to clarify whether or not one should consider operations which are not contained in the proper lorentz transformations .",
    "the couplings between states localized at different fixed points go like @xmath86 , where @xmath8 denotes the khler modulus of the corresponding orbifold plane .",
    "the real part of @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath87 , where @xmath9 is the radius of the underlying torus . clearly",
    ", @xmath87 does not change under these extra reflections , such that the absolute values of the coupling strengths will enjoy the larger symmetry @xmath85 . on the other hand , the imaginary part of @xmath8 , the so ",
    "called @xmath8axion , is related to the anti  symmetric tensor field in compact space , and does change its sign under the extra reflections . hence",
    ", if the @xmath8axion acquires a non  trivial vev , the phases of the coupling strengths do no longer enjoy the larger symmetries .",
    "as is well known , breaking the reflection symmetries in internal space can be related to cp violation in the effective 4d theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and what we discussed here is just an example for this statement .",
    "note that there are different possibilities to obtain non  trivial cp phases , also based on non  abelian discrete symmetries ( cf .",
    "it should be interesting to see if these also have an interpretation in terms of reflection symmetries in compact space .",
    "different lower  dimensional building blocks of orbifolds lead to other non  abelian discrete symmetries ( table  [ tab : survey ] ) .",
    ".survey of flavor symmetries arising from building blocks of orbifolds ( from @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath88 denote the various twisted sectors and @xmath89 the untwisted sector . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the ( non  abelian ) flavor symmetry could be broken in two ways : ( i ) explicitly : the presence of orbifold wilson lines breaks the permutation symmetry , at least partially .",
    "if the permutation symmetry is completely broken , the remaining flavor group is abelian .",
    "( ii ) spontaneously : by the vev of some twisted field , since twisted fields necessarily transform in a non  singlet representation under the flavor group . for example",
    ", @xmath90 can be broken to @xmath91 by the vev of a triplet @xmath92 ( e.g.  @xmath93 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , discrete @xmath9 symmetries could arise as discrete remnants of the lorentz symmetry of compact dimensions .",
    "this is also true for string",
    " derived orbifold models .    what are the @xmath9 charges of states localized at the fixed points ? in the framework of field theory one can not answer this question unambiguously .",
    "for instance , in many field ",
    "theoretic analysis the profiles of these fields are taken to be @xmath94functions with support at the fixed points , from which one may conclude that the states transform trivially under the discrete @xmath9 symmetries .",
    "it turns out that the naive field ",
    "theoretic expectation is incorrect .",
    "however , in string theory one can address this question . specifically , in heterotic orbifolds the @xmath9 symmetries derive from the @xmath95momentum conservation law and one can determine the @xmath9 charges unambiguously .",
    "we will discuss an explicit example in section  [ sec : nonperturbativeviolation ] .",
    "having seen how discrete symmetries arise in the effective field ",
    "theoretic description , we will now discuss which symmetries appear in explicit string models .      in recent years , many mssm candidate models have emerged from heterotic orbifolds @xcite , known as the `` heterotic mini  landscape '' .",
    "these models have a common flavor structure : focusing on the two  torus where a @xmath59 acts , the two light generations are localized on equivalent fixed points and the third one is in the bulk . therefore , as discussed above , there is a @xmath74 flavor symmetry , under which the two light generations transform as a doublet whereas the the third family transforms trivially ( let us mention that there are also alternative models without this @xmath74 @xcite ) .",
    "this symmetry is broken in potentially realistic vacua by the vevs of some localized singlets . yet , using the @xmath74 symmetric situation as a starting point and then considering corrections can have certain advantages when discussing the ( supersymmetric ) flavor structure ( cf .",
    "the emerging scheme is somewhat similar to the one of ` minimal flavor violation ' @xcite .",
    "in particular , the structure of the soft masses is @xmath96 it is known that such an approximate form of the soft masses makes it possible to avoid the supersymmetric flavor problems .",
    "in addition , it naturally allows for scenarios in which the third family of squarks and sleptons is substantially lighter than the first two generations of superpartners ( cf .  the discussion in @xcite ) .      in grand unified models , matter or @xmath9 parity",
    "can be obtained from baryon  minus  lepton  number symmetry @xmath97 by spontaneous breaking , and the same is true in string ",
    "derived models @xcite , the only difference being that @xmath97 is not in gut normalization and no large representations ( such as @xmath98plets of @xmath99 ) are required ( nor available ) to achieve the breaking @xmath100 .",
    "that is , string theory avoids huge representations like the @xmath98plets , but still allows us to derive matter parity from a local @xmath101 symmetry .",
    "similarly , proton hexality can be obtained from pati ",
    "salam ( ps ) times an extra @xmath11 symmetry @xcite .",
    "explicit orbifold models from @xmath102 compactifications using a local gut approach , @xmath103 revealed 850 heterotic mssms ( i.e.  three generations of quarks and leptons plus vector  like exotics ) , many of them with the correct proton hexality charge assignment for at least some quarks and leptons  @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 symmetries play an important role in string models .",
    "in particular , approximate continuous @xmath9 symmetries , which derive from exact discrete @xmath9 symmetries , can explain the large hierarchy between the planck , gut and/or string scales on the one hand and the electroweak and/or supersymmetry breaking scales on the other hand .",
    "it has been demonstrated that , in the presence of a continuous @xmath9 symmetry , at field configurations that satisfy the @xmath54term constraints , the vev of the superpotential vanishes @xcite .",
    "if there is an approximate @xmath9 symmetry that gets explicitly broken at some high order @xmath104 , the vacuum expectation value of the superpotential , or equivalently the gravitino mass @xmath105 , goes like @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes a typical size of a vev of fields that break the symmetry spontaneously ( in planck units ) and @xmath104 is of the order 10 in explicit examples .",
    "further , in the context of the mssm it has been shown that in settings in which matter charges are consistent with grand unification , the only anomaly ",
    "free symmetries that can forbid the @xmath108 term are @xmath9 symmetries @xcite . given that @xmath109 , or , equivalently @xmath105 , is the order parameter of @xmath9 symmetry breaking , this yields a relation between @xmath108 and @xmath105 @xcite , i.e.constitutes a solution to the @xmath108 problem .",
    "this solution does , unlike the giudice ",
    "masiero mechanism @xcite , not rely on a specific structure of the khler potential , rather it provides a holomorphic @xmath108 term of the right size , similar to the kim  nilles picture @xcite .",
    "how can one derive anomaly constraints on discrete symmetries ? it is instructive to review how they have been derived in the past .",
    "ibez and ross @xcite have used the following strategy : they have obtained @xmath110 symmetries from 1 by spontaneous breaking , as discussed in section  [ sec : znfromu1 ] .",
    "it is obvious that , if the 1 is non  anomalous , and the spontaneous breaking is done consistently , then also @xmath111 is anomaly  free .",
    "however , one may question whether these are in general true anomaly constraints or rather embedding constraints , i.e.  constraints that restrict the choice of the non  anomalous continuous gauge group into which the discrete group is supposed to be embedded .",
    "araki @xcite proposed an alternative derivation of the anomaly constraints , which does not rely on embedding the discrete symmetry into a continuous one , but by using the path integral method @xcite .",
    "this strategy has been applied to the @xmath111 case @xcite with the result that all ibez ",
    "ross constraints apply except for the @xmath112 ones , which are known not to constitute true anomaly constraints @xcite .",
    "also discrete anomaly constraints for non  abelian discrete symmetries have first been derived by using the embedding strategy @xcite ( see @xcite for a more recent discussion ) . while , again , these constraints ensure anomaly freedom , they turn out to be , in general , not true anomaly constraints but rather embedding constraints .",
    "that is , if these constraints are satisfied , the symmetry is anomaly free , but the converse is not necessarily true . in particular , the constraints can depend on the choice of the continuous symmetry into which the discrete one is supposed to be embedded .",
    "the true constraints can be derived with the path integral method @xcite , and one finds that one only has to check anomaly freedom for the abelian subgroups of a given non ",
    "abelian symmetry @xcite .",
    "for a discrete group @xmath53 and a continuous gauge symmetry @xmath113 one obtains the conditions that @xmath114 where the sum ` @xmath115 ' is over representations which are non ",
    "trivial w.r.t.to both @xmath113 and @xmath53 .",
    "the discrete abelian charge , denoted by @xmath116 , can be expressed in terms of the group elements @xmath117 as @xmath118 for the mixed gravitational@xmath53 anomaly one finds @xmath119 where the symbol ` @xmath120 ' means that the sum extends over all non  trivial representations @xmath121 of @xmath53",
    ". what does it mean if a given discrete symmetry does not satisfy these constraints ?",
    "in general , one may argue that in such a case the symmetry will be broken in an uncontrollable way and all the predictive power of the ( discrete ) symmetry will be lost . for useful applications in particle physics , reliable discrete symmetries should thus be anomaly free .",
    "there is , however , an exception : for the anomalous symmetry the anomalies might be cancelled ( microscopically ) by a discrete green - schwarz mechanism . in what follows",
    ", we shall discuss this possibility in detail .",
    "as in the case of continuous symmetries , discrete anomalies can be cancelled by a green  schwarz ( gs ) mechanism ( for a discussion in the path integral formalism see @xcite ) . also here",
    "this requires the presence of a scalar , the gs axion , which multiplies some @xmath122 terms ( with @xmath123 denoting the field strength of some continuous gauge symmetry of the model ) , and shifts under the discrete symmetry .",
    "once the axion acquires its vacuum expectation value , the discrete symmetry gets broken spontaneously .",
    "effectively this leads to a situation in which the ( anomalous part of the ) discrete group appears to be broken by non  perturbative effects . , where @xmath124 denotes the gs axion and the @xmath125 some ( matter ) fields of the theory .",
    "such terms are invariant under the full discrete group when one takes the shift transformation of the gs axion @xmath124 into account .",
    "but , when @xmath124 obtains a vacuum expectation value , the ( ` anomalous ' part of the ) discrete group is broken spontaneously . ]    as an example , consider the @xmath10 symmetry discussed in @xcite .",
    "it forbids the @xmath108 term and dimension 4 and 5 proton decay operators at the perturbative level .",
    "it appears to be broken by non ",
    "perturbative effects to its ` non  anomalous ' subgroup , i.e.  to @xmath126 matter parity .",
    "the order parameter of this @xmath9 symmetry breaking is the vacuum expectation value of the superpotential , i.e.  the gravitino mass .",
    "one therefore has , in the context of gravity mediation , a @xmath108 term of the correct size ( cf .  the analogous discussion in section  [ sec : explicitmodelsr ] ) while dimension five proton decay remains far below the experimental limits .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath9 symmetries , also non@xmath9 symmetries can appear anomalous and hence be broken non  perturbatively .",
    "this , again , introduces a hierarchically small breaking of the discrete symmetry .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this mechanism can provide us with solutions to some of the open questions in flavor physics .",
    "the flavor structure of the sm remains one of the greatest puzzles in particle physics .",
    "flavor symmetries appear to be instrumental for solving this puzzle .",
    "optimistically one may hope to find a compelling model that explains the observed flavor structure . in this case",
    "the question where the underlying family symmetries originate from is of greatest importance since given a deeper understanding may allow us to relate the observed fermion masses and mixing to some fundamental properties of our world .    in this paper we have reviewed the possible origin of discrete symmetries , paying particular attention to discrete flavor symmetries .",
    "discrete symmetries can arise from continuous symmetries by spontaneous breaking or from extra dimensions . while for abelian symmetries the first option is a very common tool in model building ,",
    "we have argued that obtaining non  abelian discrete symmetries from continuous ones ( in four dimensions ) does not lead to compelling models . on the other hand , non  abelian discrete symmetries",
    "do arise in models with extra dimensions , where they are deeply connected to the explanation of the repetition of families .",
    "in particular , in stringy extensions of the standard model such symmetries often arise",
    ". therefore they can play an important role in understanding or addressing the flavor puzzle in the standard model as well as in solving flavor problems in extensions such as the mssm .",
    "we have also commented on discrete anomalies , which constrain possible discrete symmetries in bottom  up model building . as we have pointed out",

    "we give a brief introduction to orbifolds following @xcite .",
    "we start with the geometrical construction in appendix  [ sec : appendixa1 ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendixa2 ] we depict how heterotic strings are compactified on orbifolds and appendix  [ sec : stringselectionrules ] reviews string selection rules .      from the geometrical point of view , a @xmath127dimensional ( toroidal ) orbifold is defined as the quotient of @xmath128 divided by a discrete group @xmath34 , called the space group . for @xmath110 orbifolds ,",
    "the elements of the space group @xmath129 are given by @xmath130 with sum over @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath127 ( linearly independent ) vectors @xmath133 generate a lattice @xmath134 and hence define a torus @xmath135 .",
    "the rotation @xmath50 is of order @xmath104 ( i.e.  @xmath136 ) and is chosen to be an automorphism of @xmath134 .",
    "then the action of @xmath34 is not free , i.e.  there are fixed points @xmath137 with @xmath138 for some @xmath129 .",
    "the space group element @xmath139 associated to the fixed point @xmath140 is called the constructing element , see figure  [ fig : fixedpoints ] .",
    "the resulting orbifold is written as @xmath141 .        compactifying the heterotic string on six  dimensional orbifolds yields three different classes of closed strings : ( i ) untwisted strings with constructing element @xmath142 which would also close in uncompactified space , ( ii ) winding modes with constructing elements @xmath143 which would also close on the torus and ( iii ) twisted strings , localized at the fixed points , with constructing elements @xmath144 with @xmath145 which only close on the orbifold due to the @xmath50 rotation .",
    "the winding modes are massive with masses near the planck scale .",
    "since we are only interested in the low  energy effective action they are ignored in the following .",
    "the geometrical action of the space group has to be amended by an action on the gauge degrees of freedom of the heterotic string in order to fulfill the stringy consistency conditions of modular invariance . in the standard approach",
    "this is achieved by so called shifts and wilson lines . specifying these input parameters",
    "completely defines an orbifold compactification and allows one to compute the massless spectrum .",
    "an elegant way to obtain consistent orbifold models , for example mssm  like models , to compute their massless spectra and to analyze their resulting four  dimensional effective theories is given by the public code `` orbifolder ''  @xcite .",
    "the cft description allows one to compute scattering amplitudes of strings on orbifolds . in the four  dimensional effective theory",
    "these amplitudes enter as coupling strengths of allowed terms in the superpotential .",
    "their computation is technically involved .",
    "hence , at a first step one is only interested in the string selection rules determining which coupling is allowed or forbidden . in many cases the string selection rules can be interpreted as a symmetry of the four  dimensional effective theory .",
    "the ( standard ) string selection rules are :    1 .",
    "gauge invariance 2 .",
    "space group selection rule : the space group selection rule reflects the geometrical possibility of orbifold strings to join .",
    "consider @xmath146 strings with constructing elements @xmath147 .",
    "then the coupling is allowed if @xmath148 , see figure  [ fig : spacegroupselectionrule ] .",
    "+ spacegroupselectionrule.pstex_t 3",
    ".   @xmath9 charge conservation : @xmath9 charge conservation is a discrete remnant of ten  dimensional lorentz symmetry .",
    "it arises whenever the orbifold @xmath149 respects some additional rotational symmetry beside @xmath150 .",
    "for example , for a factorized orbifold , i.e.  an orbifold whose lattice @xmath134 is the direct product of three two  dimensional lattices @xmath151 , a rotation in the sublattice @xmath152 by @xmath153 is a symmetry of the theory .",
    "the rotation by @xmath154 is of order @xmath155 ( i.e.  @xmath156 ) and results in a @xmath157 symmetry @xmath158 where @xmath159 with the oscillator numbers @xmath160 and @xmath161 ( see e.g.  @xcite for their definition ) , @xmath162 are the bosonic right  moving momenta and the factor @xmath163 originates from the normalization such that fermions have a shifted @xmath9 charge by @xmath164 .",
    "+ if the two  dimensional lattice @xmath152 has a higher symmetry than @xmath155 there is an additional string selection rule known as `` rule 4 '' .",
    "for example , the @xmath165 root lattice of a @xmath17 orbifold allows for @xmath166 sublattice rotations .",
    "if all strings involved in a given interaction sit at the same fixed point they feel the higher symmetry and the @xmath9 symmetry is enhanced to @xmath167 .",
