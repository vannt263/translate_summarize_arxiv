    "the prediction of glueball masses has long been attempted in lattice gauge theory calculations @xcite .",
    "these calculations show that the lowest - lying scalar , tensor and axial vector glueballs lie in the mass region of 1 - 2.5 gev . while there is a long history of glueball mass calculations in lattice qcd , little",
    "is known about the glueballs besides their masses .",
    "accurate lattice calculations of their size , matrix elements and form factors would help considerably in their experimental identification .",
    "glueball wave functions and sizes have been studied in the past @xcite , but much of the early work contains uncontrolled systematic errors , most notably from discretisation effects .",
    "the scalar glueball is particularly susceptible to such errors for the wilson gauge action , due to the presence of a critical end point of a line of phase transitions ( not corresponding to any physical transition found in qcd ) in the fundamental - adjoint coupling plane . as this critical end - point ( which defines the continuum limit of a @xmath6 scalar field theory )",
    "is neared , the coherence length in the scalar channel becomes large , which means that the mass gap in this channel becomes small ; glueballs in other channels seem to be affected very little .",
    "results in which the scalar glueball was found to be significantly smaller than the tensor were most likely due to contamination of the scalar glueball from this non - qcd critical point @xcite . on the other hand , the calculations using operator overlaps obtained from variational optimization for improved lattice gauge action , which are designed to avoid spurious critical point , show that the scalar and tensor glueballs were of typical hadronic dimensions @xcite . a straightforward procedure to address the controversy over glueball size is to measure the glueball wave function , much in the same way as the meson and baryon wave functions were measured @xcite .",
    "as a first test of our method we study the low - lying scalar and tensor glueballs and their wave functions for the 3-dimensional u(1 ) model with tadpole improved symanzik gauge action .",
    "this theory is perhaps the best understood of all lattice gauge theories at zero temperature , which makes it testing ground for new analytic and numerical methods .",
    "the relevance of the model to qcd at finite temperature @xcite , including confinement , chiral symmetry breaking @xcite and existence of a mass gap@xcite , suggest that a comparison of the respective mass spectra should be informative .",
    "our techniques for calculating the glueball wave functions from wilson loop operators are outlined in sec .",
    "we present and discuss our results at zero temperature in sec .",
    "we extend our method to examine the wave functions and masses at finite temperature in this section . here",
    "we briefly discuss an interpretation of the deconfinement in terms of the power - law behaviour of the correlation function .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the summary and concluding remarks .",
    "in contrast with the techniques used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we measure our lattice operators from spatially connected wilson loops .",
    "glueballs are colour singlet states and one should be able to construct them with closed - loop paths which are gauge invariant .",
    "the choice of such loops eliminate the need for gauge fixing dependence compared to @xmath7 dependence of two - link operator used in ref .",
    "the lower dimension operator yields a linear dependence in the correlation function as opposed to @xmath8 dependence for wilson loops .",
    "this improves the glueball signal as @xmath9 is reduced . ] .",
    "although the calculations in ref . @xcite have produced some interesting results , the approach suffers from a basic problem : the observables are calculated from a lattice version of the 2-glue operator , which risks a mixture of glueball states with flux states .    in this paper",
    "we take a more direct approach to the problem .",
    "we measure the observables in a three - step procedure .",
    "first , we calculate the lattice operator @xmath10 , \\label{eqn01}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the plaquette operator and @xmath12 measures the two plaquette or two - loop component of the glueball wave function .",
    "the @xmath13 dependence will be reflected in the length of links required to close the loops . from a suitable linear combinations of rotation ,",
    "parity inversions and real or imaginary parts of the operators involved in @xmath12 , one can construct glueball operators with desired quantum numbers .",
    "since we want to explore the nature of wave functions , we focus only on the low - lying `` symmetric '' and `` antisymmetric '' scalar channels ( which are the cosine and sine , respectively of the wilson loop in question ) and tensor glueball states .",
    "the wave function and mass are obtained from the correlation function : @xmath14 where one needs to subtract the vacuum contribution from the correlator for @xmath15 state .",
    "the source can be held fixed while the sink takes on the r dependence .",
    "this proves to be helpful in maintaining a good signal .",
    "the disentangling of the glueball and torelon is usually taken care of automatically by the choice of wilson or polyakov loops .    to increase the overlap with the lowest state and reduce the contamination from higher states , we exploit the ape link smearing techniques @xcite . the procedure is implemented by an iterative replacement of the original spatial link variable by a smeared link .",
    "this results in correlations which reach their asymptotic behaviour at small time separations .",
    "in addition , the noise from ultraviolet fluctuations is reduced .",
    "the smearing parameter is fixed to @xmath16 and ten iterations of the smearing process are used . to find the optimum smearing value , @xmath17",
    ", we examine the ratio ( at @xmath18 and 1 ) @xmath19 which should be maximum for good ground state dominance . using @xmath20 loop as template ,",
    "the best signal is obtained with four smearing steps , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 loops being almost indistinguishable . at @xmath23 ,",
    "the signal in @xmath24 showed a slow convergence with @xmath17 , hence @xmath22 loops were preferred for optimum overlap . a typical value which proved to be sufficient for this case was @xmath25 .",
    "a second pass was made to measure the optimized correlation matrices @xmath26    let @xmath27 be the radial wave function of the @xmath28-th eigenstate of the transfer matrix , then @xmath29 the glueball masses and the wave functions are extracted from the monte carlo average of @xmath30 by diagonalizing the correlation matrices @xmath31 for successive times @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues and @xmath35 a rotation matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of @xmath36 .",
    "each eigenvector of @xmath36 matches an eigenstate @xmath37 of the complete transfer matrix . as the wave function is largest at the origin",
    ", one would first determine the glueball mass with the optimal separation , and then fix that mass for all r , and extract the wave function for less optimal separations .",
    "similar to the case of mesons @xcite , the wave function is expected to decrease exponentially with the @xmath13 at large separations and is therefore fitted with the simple form @xmath38 to determine the effective radius @xmath39 .",
    "the effective mass can be read off directly from the largest eigenvalue corresponding to the lowest energy @xmath40 \\label{eqn07}\\ ] ]",
    "most of our monte carlo calculations are carried out on @xmath41 lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath42 is the space - like box and @xmath43 is the extension in euclidean time direction ) .",
    "the gauge configurations are generated using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "after the equilibration , configurations are stored every 250 sweeps ; 2000 stored configurations are used in the measurement of glueball masses .",
    "measurements made on the stored configurations are binned into 10 blocks with each block containing an average of 200 measurements .",
    "the mean and the final errors are obtained using single - elimination jackknife method with each bin regarded as an independent data point .",
    "three sets of measurements were taken at @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "some finite - size consistency checks are done at @xmath46 2.5 on an @xmath47 lattice .",
    "the glueball correlation function for the @xmath15 channel against @xmath32 at @xmath46 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figcorr ] .",
    "it can be seen that the expected behaviour of correlation function is attained virtually straight away .",
    "the absolute errors in the correlation functions are expected to be independent of @xmath32 for large @xmath32 .",
    "our errors are consistent with this expectation .    effective mass plot for @xmath48 simulation is presented in fig .",
    "[ figeffmass ] . for @xmath15 and @xmath49",

    "an acceptable fit was only possible for @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the wave functions are extracted at time - separations @xmath53 and 2 .",
    "we found a little variation ( less than two percent ) in the eigenvectors of @xmath31 with @xmath32 which suggests that there is no mixing with states of distinct masses .",
    "typical plots of the wave functions , normalised to unity at the origin , for the symmetric and antisymmetric scalar glueballs , at @xmath44 and 2.5 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig0pp ] and [ fig0 mm ] respectively . for guiding the eyes the monte carlo points of the same @xmath54-value",
    "are connected with straight lines .",
    "the scalar wave function shows the expected behaviour for all the @xmath54 values analysed here .    as for the antisymmetric channel we notice the presence of negative contributions in the glueball wave function for @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "however these contributions do not persist when the lattice size is increased from @xmath57 to 20 .",
    "this would mean that these effects are unphysical and can be described as a finite volume artifact .",
    "for this reason we extract the effective radius of the antisymmetric state from the wave function obtained at larger volume .",
    "the symmetric scalar glueball wave function , on the other hand , barely changes sign .",
    "[ fig2pp ] shows the wave function for the tensor glueball , at @xmath58 and 2.5 .",
    "the tensor wave function remains positive and shows the expected flatness .",
    "it can be seen that tensor glueball is much more extended than the scalar as one moves towards higher @xmath54 values .",
    "this would imply that tensor is therefore more sensitive to the finite - size effects , which is very visible in the distortion of the wave function for large @xmath13 at @xmath59 .",
    "naively we would expect that the spatial size at which we begin to encounter large finite size effects to be related to the size of the glueball .",
    "the expected finite - size scaling behaviour of the mass gap near the continuum critical point in this model is not known ; but weigel and janke @xcite have performed a monte carlo simulation for an o(2 ) spin model in three dimensions which should lie in the same universality class , obtaining @xmath60 for the magnetic gap . in order to ascertain the finite - size effect on our measurements , we performed extra simulations on a @xmath47 lattice at @xmath46 and 2.5 .",
    "the mass and size of @xmath15 channel are almost unchanged as the lattice size increases from 16 to 20 .",
    "we also find that our estimates for the tensor state are consistent with no finite volume dependence at @xmath61 .",
    "however , the tensor mass was found to increase by about @xmath62 and the effective radius by about @xmath63 from 16 to 20 lattices at @xmath59 .",
    "we do not have enough data extrapolate mass and the radius to the infinite volume limit or to check whether the difference is due to statistical errors or whether there is an incomplete convergence . given that no mass reductions of sufficient magnitudes were found as the lattice volume",
    "is changed , none of our states could be interpreted as a torelon pair .    in order to get some quantitative information on the effective radius",
    ", the glueball wave functions are fitted in the range @xmath64 by the form ( [ eqn06 ] ) .",
    "this form fits the data rather well for the scalar glueball with the best - fit estimates obtained with a @xmath65 of 0.92 - 0.67 . due to distortion",
    ", it follows that eq .",
    "( [ eqn06 ] ) holds only in the limited interval , which does not include the vicinity of @xmath66 .",
    "] in the tensor wave function at small @xmath13 at @xmath56 , a meaningful fit was possible only in the range @xmath67 .",
    "the effective radius obtained was confirmed by examining the plateau in the ratio @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "note , that our lograthmically plotted wave functions ( fig .",
    "[ figlogwf ] ) are merely illustrations .    to summarize : in the weak coupling region a spectrum of massive @xmath15 , @xmath49 and @xmath69 glueballs",
    "is indicated with @xmath70 since there is a good signal for wave function persisting long enough to demonstrate convergence to the asymptotic value , it seems to be reasonable to estimate mass ratios with our present method .",
    "the estimates of masses and @xmath39 , in lattice units , at various @xmath54 values are shown in tables [ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] .    .",
    "[ tab1 ] masses of scalar glueballs in lattice units for two spatial extensions , @xmath57 and 20 .

    "we choose to take products of the effective radii , @xmath71 , to @xmath72 since the string tension is our most accurately calculated quantity . as in the ( 3 + 1)d confining theories",
    ", we expect that dimensionless product of physical quantities , such as @xmath73 , will approach their continuum limit with correction of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the effective lattice spacing in  physical units \" when the mass gap has been renormalized to a constant @xcite .",
    "the string tension , @xmath76 , is obtained by using the wilson loop averages and fitting the on - axis data with @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ figcontrad ] we show the product @xmath73 plotted against @xmath75 . since the products are plotted against @xmath75 , the continuum extrapolations are simple straight lines .",
    "we notice that the product @xmath73 varies only slightly over the fitting range .",
    "the non - zero lattice spacing values of the product are within 0.04 - 0.29 and 0.01 - 0.02 standard deviations of the extrapolated zero lattice spacing results for the scalar and tensor glueballs respectively .",
    "the striking feature of this plot is the little variation of the product with @xmath75 .",
    "this will make for very accurate and reliable continuum extrapolations .",
    "linear extrapolations to the continuum limit yield values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , in the units of string tension , for the scalar and tensor states , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the tensor , the scalar glueball size shows significant finite - spacing errors . by setting the string tension to 420 mev",
    ", we obtain the physical radii of 0.28(7 ) and 0.52(5 ) fm , for the scalar and tensor glueballs , respectively .",
    "our results show the size of the tensor glueball roughly two times as large as the scalar glueball .",
    "the extension of the method to the su(3 ) lattice gauge theory @xcite yielded very similar results for the glueball size in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "these estimates agree with the rough estimates of glueball sizes obtained at various temperatures in ref .",
    "this is an improvement over the estimates obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where the predicted radius for the tensor glueball ( @xmath81 fm ) was found four times larger than scalar glueball radius .      to check the consistency of our method",
    ", we performed a study on an asymmetric lattice : @xmath82 at @xmath61 .",
    "the procedure itself is a straight forward extension of the procedure adopted in the previous subsection .",
    "we do not plan to study the high temperature aspects of this model here but focus on the behaviour of the glueball mass and wave function in the deconfined region .",
    "the physical temperature @xmath83 , is given via the lattice parameters as follows : @xmath84 for completeness , we give a temperature estimate of 1.125 in the units of string tension . by setting the string tension to 420 mev",
    ", we estimate a physical temperature of @xmath85 , where the @xmath86 mev at pseudo - critical coupling @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "one expects @xcite that the high temperature phase has a massless photon and the linear potential is replaced by the two dimensional logarithmic coulomb potential .",
    "this logarithmic behaviour is equivalent to a power - law dependence of the wilson loop correlation function , @xmath88 with an exponent which decreases as @xmath89 increases .",
    "furthermore , since the high - temperature phase of the gauge theory corresponds to the ordered phase of the spin system , the predicted power - law behaviour of the correlation function is just like that of a two - dimensional u(1)-invariant spin system - a 2-d xy model .",
    "[ figcorzt ] shows a plot of correlation functions versus separation .",
    "the straight line indicates the fit to the form ( [ eqn11 ] ) .",
    "the finite temperature phase transition is visible in the change of the correlation function from exponential to power - law behaviour .",
    "thus it becomes evident that @xmath90 in our simulation .",
    "it can be seen that form ( [ eqn11 ] ) fits the data rather well .",
    "nonetheless , our monte carlo simulations were unable to confirm that the exponent is moving towards the value of 0.25 ( that of the 2-d xy model @xcite ) predicted for the continuum theory .",
    "our estimated value for the exponent is four times larger than the predicted value .",
    "this indicates that our @xmath54 value of 2.25 is not large enough to gives us reason to hope that we are approaching continuum physics .",
    "an interesting feature to explore in this context is whether the coupling to the matter fields in the leading order ( @xmath91 ) calculations will move the critical exponent towards the predicted value .",
    "[ figzt ] shows the scalar and tensor wave functions obtained through the same analysis as in figs .",
    "[ fig0pp ] and [ fig2pp ] .",
    "our results indicate that no significant changes occur in the scalar and tensor wave functions .",
    "glueball masses appear almost unaffected . by comparing the results at @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    ", we observe an effective mass reduction , ( @xmath94 ) , of about @xmath62 , with statistical uncertainties typically on less than a percent level , for @xmath15 and @xmath69 glueball modes .",
    "this appear to be a very small change since we expect a rather continuous mass reduction of glueballs in the deconfined phase .",
    "this might be due to the fact that for zero momentum the power - law behaviour of the correlation function leads at short distances to the spin - wave results , which prevents us from seeing the massless excitations .",
    "the non - vanishing effective masses would suggest the presence of glueball modes above @xmath95 .",
    "other work on finite temperature su(3 ) @xcite has also confirmed the survival of correlations above @xmath95 in the scalar and tensor colour - singlet modes .",
    "however , these studies have shown that thermal mass changes rather continuously across the critical temperature .",
    "the existence of the effective mass gives rise to the possibility that some of the nonperturbative effects survive in the deconfined phase , and the colour - singlet modes exist as metastable states above @xmath95 .",
    "the metastable states in the ordered phase ( large @xmath54 ) appear to be caused by the unusually large separation of a vortex pair , which may take many sweeps to recombine .",
    "near the transition the number of vortices increase , and some of them begin to unbind .",
    "this eventually drives the system into a disordered phase as one moves to the region @xmath96 .",
    "whether bound or metastable modes , the glueballs can decay into two or more gluons thus acquiring finite width which is expected to become less negligible in the deconfined phase .",
    "thus it becomes important to take into account the effect of width in best - fit analysis .",
    "this might also explain a very modest reduction of our masses at @xmath90 .",
    "however , from this study , it is not possible to determine whether such colour singlet modes really survive above @xmath95 as metastable states .",
    "an extensive systematic analysis , of unquenched improved lattice qcd at finite temperature , along these lines is under way @xcite .",
    "we have studied wave functions and sizes of scalar and tensor glueballs using improved 3-dimensional u(1 ) lattice model . in this preliminary study",
    "we take a more direct approach to the problem ; instead of fixing a gauge or a path for the gluons , we measure the correlation functions from our lattice operators from spatially connected wilson loops which , being the expectation values of closed - loop paths , are gauge invariant .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the disentangling of the glueball and torelon is usually taken care of automatically by the choice of wilson or polyakov loops .",
    "we observed that the size of tensor glueball is roughly two times larger than the size of the scalar glueball .",
    "we have successfully extended our method to extract the results of glueball sizes for su(3 ) lattice gauge model and obtained some encouraging results @xcite .",
    "we believe that our estimates are more reliable than the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the size of the tensor glueball was found to be @xmath81 fm , four times as large as its scalar counterpart .",
    "the predicted zero lattice spacing results are not actually found by extrapolation to zero lattice spacing , but are obtained instead from calculations at @xmath54 of 2.2 of glueball size , with no accurate representation of the effect of the absence of extrapolation . also the results were of limited interest because of their manifest dependence on the gauge chosen and the problem of disentangling of the glueballs and torelons .",
    "finally , for completeness , we extended our method to measure the wave function and mass for a finite temperature deconfinement phase .",
    "for the lowest @xmath15 and @xmath69 glueballs , no significant mass reduction was observed in deconfined phase , while the wave functions remain almost unchanged .",
    "the existence of the effective mass indicates that colour - singlet modes may survive in the deconfined phase as metastable states .",
    "in such a case glueball decay and decay width , as spectral component , in the deconfinement phase are the most feasible candidates for a more reliable analysis for the future studies .",
