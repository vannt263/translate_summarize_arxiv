    "the past decade has witnessed the great progress in the cold atomic physics .",

    "spins of atoms are fully polarized by the zeemann field @xcite , thus atoms are effectively of single component .",
    "a few years later , important achievement was made to release the spin degrees of freedom by using optical methods to trap atoms , such as optical traps and lattices @xcite .",
    "an additional advantage of optical lattices is the excellent controllability of the interaction strength from the weak coupling to strong coupling regimes .",
    "for example , the superfluid to mott insulator transition of bosons has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "all these progresses provide a controllable way to study high spin physics , in particular , the strongly correlated high spin physics .",
    "the high spin physics with cold atoms contains novel features which does not appear in solid state systems . in many transition metal oxides ,",
    "several electrons are combined by hund s rule to form an onsite composite high spin object with @xmath10 .",
    "however , the intersite coupling is still dominated by the exchange process of a single pair of electrons , thus the leading order spin exchange is the bilinear heisenberg term . due to the @xmath11 effect ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are typically weak . in other words ,",
    "the solid state high spin systems are more classical than spin-@xmath12 systems .",
    "in contrast , such restriction does not happen in high spin systems with cold atoms because the building block of such systems , each atom , carries a high hyperfine spin @xmath13 which includes both electron and nuclear spins .",
    "this feature renders the possible high hidden symmetries and strong quantum fluctuations .    the high spin bosonic systems exhibit much richer phase diagram than the spinless boson . in spin-1 systems of @xmath14na and @xmath15rb atoms , polar and ferromagnetic spinor condensations and",
    "related collective modes were studied by ho @xcite and ohmi _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the @xmath16 charge and @xmath17 spin degrees of freedom in the spinor condensate is characterized by a @xmath18 gauge symmetry .",
    "the topological aspect of this hidden @xmath18 gauge symmetry was investigated extensively by zhou @xcite and demler _ et al _ @xcite .",

    "such systems are very special in that in additional to the obvious spin @xmath17 symmetry , they possess a hidden and _ generic _ @xmath6 or isomorphically , @xmath7 symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we will review this progress .",
    "before we move on , let us briefly review some group theory knowledge .",
    "the @xmath6 group describes the rotation in the 5-dimensional space spanned by five real axes @xmath22 which form the vector representation of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath6 group has ten generators @xmath23 , each of which is responsible for the rotation in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "these generators form @xmath6 s 10 dimensional adjoint representation .",
    "s fundamental spinor representation is 4-dimensional . rigorously speaking",
    ", its spinor representation is faithful for @xmath6 s covering group @xmath7 .",
    "the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is similar to that between @xmath25 and @xmath17 . for simplicity",
    ", we will not distinguish the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 below .",
    "the origin of the @xmath6 symmetry in spin-@xmath9 systems can be explained as follows : the kinetic energy term shows an obvious @xmath26 symmetry because of the equivalence among the four spin components @xmath27 .",
    "however , this @xmath26 symmetry generally speaking is broken explicitly down to @xmath6 by interactions .",
    "pauli s exclusion principle requires that in the @xmath8-wave scattering channel , only interactions @xmath28 in the total spin singlet channel ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 in the quintet channel @xmath31 are allowed , while those in the channels of @xmath32 are forbidden .",
    "remarkably , the singlet and quintet channels automatically form the identity and 5-vector representations for an @xmath6 group ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : so5 ] for detail ) , thus making the system @xmath6 invariant without fine tuning .",
    "the same reasoning also applies to the existence of the @xmath6 symmetry in the lattice hubbard model .",
    "the validity of this @xmath6 symmetry is regardless of dimensionality , lattice geometry and impurity potentials .",
    "basically , it plays the same role of the @xmath17 symmetry in the spin-@xmath12 systems .",
    "this @xmath6 symmetry purely lies in the particle - hole channel as an extension of the spin @xmath17 algebra .",
    "it is qualitatively different from the @xmath6 theory in the high t@xmath33 superconductivity @xcite which involves both particle - hole and particle - particle channels .    to our knowledge ,",
    "such a high symmetry without fine tuning is rare in condensed matter and cold atomic systems , and thus it is worthwhile for further exploration .",
    "below we outline several important consequences from the @xmath6 symmetry and other interesting properties in spin-@xmath9 systems .",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry brings hidden degeneracy in the collective modes in the fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "this symmetry greatly facilitates the understanding of the mean field phase diagram in the lattice system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the time - reversal properties of the @xmath6 algebra , the sign problem of the quantum monte - carlo algorithm is proved to be absent in a large part of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "spin-@xmath9 systems can support the quintet cooper pairing phase i.e. , cooper pair with total spin @xmath34 .",
    "this high spin superfluid state possesses the topological defect of the half - quantum vortex often called the alice string .",
    "an interesting property of the half quantum vortex loop or pair is that they can carry spin quantum number as a global analogy of the cheshire charge in the gauge theories . interestingly , in the quintet pairing state , when a quasiparticle carrying spin penetrates the cheshire charged half - quantum vortex loop , quantum entanglement is generated between them .",
    "the alice string and non - abelian cheshire charge behavior in spin-@xmath9 systems were studied by wu _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "fermionic systems with multiple components can support multiple - particle clustering instabilities , which means more than two fermions come together to form bound states @xcite .",
    "for example , baryons are bound states of three - quarks , @xmath35-particles are bound states of two protons and two neutrons , and bi - excitons are bound state of two electrons and two holes .",
    "spin-@xmath9 systems can exhibit quartetting order as a four - fermion counterpart of the cooper pairing .",
    "taking into account the arrival of the fermion pairing superfluidity by feshbach resonances @xcite , it is natural to expect the quartetting order as a possible research focus in the near future .",
    "the existence of the quartetting order and its competition with the singlet pairing order were investigated by wu @xcite in 1d spin-@xmath9 systems .",
    "the generalization of the quartetting order to even higher spin systems at 1d was investigated by lecheminant _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "spin-@xmath9 magnetic systems are characterized by strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "this is a little bit counter - intuitive because one would expect weak quantum fluctuations due to the high spin .",
    "however , because of the high symmetry of @xmath6 , quantum fluctuations are actually even stronger than those in spin @xmath12 systems .",
    "for example , spin-@xmath9 systems at quarter filling ( one particle per site ) can exhibit the @xmath26 plaquette order which is a four - site counterpart of the dimer state in spin-@xmath12 systems .",
    "an @xmath26 majumdar - ghosh model was constructed by chen _",
    "@xcite in the spin-@xmath9 two - leg ladder systems .",
    "their ground state is exactly solvable and exhibits such plaquette order .    on the experimental side , in addition to alkali atoms ,",
    "considerable progress has been made in trapping and cooling the divalent alkaline - earth atoms @xcite .",
    "two candidate spin-@xmath9 atoms are alkaline - earth atoms of @xmath3ba and @xmath4ba .",
    "their resonances of @xmath36 are at 553.7 nm @xcite , thus making them as promising candidates for laser cooling and further experimental investigation .",
    "their scattering lengths are not available now , but that of @xmath37ba ( spin 0 ) was estimated as @xmath38 @xcite . because the @xmath39 shell of ba is fully - filled , both the @xmath40 , @xmath41 of @xmath3ba and @xmath4ba should have the similar value .",
    "considering the rapid development in this field , we expect that more spin-3/2 systems can be realized experimentally .    in the rest of this paper",

    "in this section , we will review the hidden symmetry properties of spin-@xmath9 systems @xcite .",
    "let us first look at a familiar example of hidden symmetry : the hydrogen atom .",
    "the hydrogen atom has an obvious @xmath25 symmetry which can not explain the large energy level degeneracy pattern of @xmath43 . actually , this degeneracy is not accidental .",
    "it arises from the @xmath44 coulomb potential which gives rise to a hidden conserved quantity , the runge - lentz ( r - l ) vector .",

    "now we can ask : what are the hidden conserved quantities in spin-3/2 systems ? we will answer this question below .",
    "we start with the generic form of the spin-@xmath9 hamiltonian of the continuum model @xcite .",
    "the only assumptions we will make are the spin @xmath17 symmetry and the @xmath8-wave scattering interactions . required by paul s exclusion principle , the spin channel wave function of two fermions has to be antisymmetric in the @xmath8-partial wave channel . as a result ,",
    "only two independent interaction channels exist with the total spin @xmath46 . taking the above facts into account",
    ", the hamiltonian reads h&= & d^dr   \\ { _ = 3/2 , 1/2 ^_(r ) ( -^2- ) _ ( r ) + g_0 p_0,0^(r ) p_0,0(r ) + & + & g_2 _",

    "the lattice fermion operators and their continuum counterparts are related by @xmath71 .    the best way to understand",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry without going through the mathematical details is to look at the energy level diagram for the single site problem as depicted in fig .",
