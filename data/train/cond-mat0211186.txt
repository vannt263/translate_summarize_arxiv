    "membrane hemifusion is a possible pathway ( see @xcite for an alternative view ) to the complete fusion of membranes @xcite .",
    "current theories associate the initiation of hemifusion with the formation of a contact zone between the membranes in which the two proximal monolayers are connected by a stalk - shaped neck .",
    "the stalk then expands and a region is formed ( region c in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , in which the two distal monolayers form a single bilayer . in general",
    ", the energetic cost of the splay of the lipid chains in the stalk , prohibits its spontaneous expansion .",
    "however , the presence of additional , external forces ( e.g. pressure , surface tension gradients , electrostatic effects ) can lead to expansion of the stalk into a hemifusion region and to the growth of this zone .",
    "clear evidence for the existence of these two distinct pre - fusion stages , stalk formation and hemifusion , was found for peg mediated fusion of vesicles @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical paper @xcite suggested that the flow of lipids from region b to region a can be caused by an increase of the surface tension in region a due to the presence ( in that region only ) of additional polymer in solution .",
    "the tension gradient between these regions induces a flow of lipids , that leads to the growth of region c.    a different scenario , where hemifusion can be an alternative pathway to fusion was found in influenza hemagglutinin - mediated fusion @xcite .",
    "the initial local stalk may evolve to a fusion pore @xcite , or it may expand to hemifusion . in the latter case ,",
    "no fusion occurs .    in this paper",
    ", we predict the dynamics of the expansion of the initial stalk and its role in the growth of a mesoscopic hemifusion diaphragm .",
    "the nucleation of a stalk by thermal fluctuations was recently shown to be thermally accessible @xcite . a detailed description of the kinetics of this nucleation event ( that typically describes the formation of a stalk of several nanometers in extent ) is outside the scope of our work . instead , we focus on estimates of the conditions that facilitate stalk expansion into hemifusion .",
    "we discuss the implications of our theory on biological fusion mechanisms and on in - vitro experiments .",
    "in addition , we predict the growth of the hemifusion region ( e.g. from nanometers to microns ) as a function of time and discuss the physical parameters that can be used to control the time scale for hemifusion .",
    "this dynamic part is relevant mainly to in - vitro experiments , since biological fusion events generally remain at the microscopic scale of the stalk .",
    "if hemifusion is an intermediate state of fusion then it is important to contrast the time scales of hemifusion diaphragm expansion and pore formation , in order to determine the rate limiting step .",
    "@xcite predicted that pore expansion is exponential in time , with a time scale of @xmath0 sec , where @xmath1 is the membrane viscosity and @xmath2 is the surface tension difference ( both are estimated below ) .",
    "however , if pore nucleation is slow enough significant expansion of the hemifusion diaphragm can occur before pore formation .",
    "this is the case considered here , where we predict that the hemifusion diaphragm expands as the square root of time .",
    "our theoretical model is motivated by and consistent with the experiments described by @xcite , where two bilayers supported on mica surfaces were brought into contact in the presence of a peg - water solution .",
    "hemifusion , that eventually extended over a distance of @xmath3 was observed in a time of about 10 minutes , while the time it took the initial stalk to form was less then 3 minutes .",
    "this suggest that , at least in this experiment , the rate limiting step for hemifusion is the expansion of the fusion zone , as opposed to stalk formation .",
    "this paper presents a simple theoretical model relevant to this experimental system @xcite , and predicts the time dependence of hemifusion expansion . the overall time scale we find is comparable with the measurements of @xcite while the details of the predicted temporal dependence have yet to be tested experimentally .",
    "our theoretical model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] that is a simplification of the experimental system of @xcite wherein two bilayers deposited on mica cylinders are brought together in a solution of peg and water .",
    "the lipids of the distal monolayers are physisorbed on the mica ; this fixes their lateral density . from here",
    "on in this paper , the term lipid",
    "density relates to the lateral density of the proximal monolayers ( see fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "we assume that the lipids are in _ local _ equilibrium , so at a particular location @xmath4 , the free energy per lipid ( in the proximal monolayers ) @xmath5 , does not depend on the lipid microstate , but only on the lipid density @xmath6 .",
    "this assumption of local equilibrium is consistent with our results that predict an overall time scale for hemifusion expansion that is much larger than the local diffusion time of a single lipid molecule .    the experimental system we consider is macroscopically cylindrically symmetric and we therefore assume cylindrical symmetry of all the physical quantities at mesoscopic length scales .",
    "this is justified because all flows ( of water and lipids ) are laminar , and there are no mechanisms that might induce angular fluctuations or instabilities .",
    "we distinguish between three regions , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] :    * * region a * - where the distance @xmath7 between the bilayers is typically much larger than the polymer correlation length @xmath8 @xcite . in this region ,",
    "the outer lipid monolayer is in contact with the peg in the solution .",
    "the free energy per molecule in this region is given by @xmath9 , and is different ( in its functional form ) from the free energy @xmath10 of the monolayer in the absence of peg .",
    "* * region b * - where @xmath11 . for these values of @xmath7 ,",
    "the peg density near the bilayers is negligible and our model assumes that there is no peg in contact with the bilayers in this region .",
    "the free energy per lipid in this zone is @xmath12 .",
    "in addition we assume that the distance between the mica surfaces is constant ( the mica surfaces in the experiment are deformed and flattened under pressure ) , and that this region is ring - shaped with an outer radius @xmath13 , and an inner radius @xmath14 . * * region c * - the region where the distal bilayers are in contact .",
    "the bilayers are langmuir - blodgett deposited in water , without peg , which is added later .",
    "the energy per lipid when the monolayers are in contact with water is @xmath10 and the proximal monolayers are initially langmuir - blodgett deposited with a density @xmath15 that minimizes @xmath16 .",
    "when peg is added , it induces an effective attraction between the polar heads @xcite , and changes the functional form of the energy as function of the lipid density to @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of lipid condensation in the presence of peg @xcite hasa been discussed in terms of the the dehydration of the bilayer by the peg @xcite .",
    "this dehydration affects the lipids in region a that are in microscopic proximity to the peg , but has no effect on the lipids in region b. in sec .",
    "[ sec : pressure ] we demonstrate that the osmotic pressure induced by the peg is too small to induce hemifusion .",
    "this stands in contrast to the surface tension effects that are the main focus of our work .",
    "if equilibrium could be reached , the lipid density in region a would tend to increase in the presence of peg .",
    "however , the number of lipids in the monolayers can not increase to any significant degree within the time scale of the experiments , since the concentration of lipids in the bulk solution is negligible and the number of lipids that can be transported from region b to region a is much smaller than that of region a. thus , the lipid density is unchanged and the energy per lipid in region a is now @xmath18 , with the derivative @xmath19 due to the induced head attraction .",
    "this condensation effect thus leads to a _ negative tension _ in the proximal monolayers that ideally would cause them to contract in extent .",
    "they can not do this without exposing the chains of the inner monolayers to the water and this is energetically prohibitive .",
    "the outer monolayers are therefore stressed and one way of relieving that stress is for additional lipid to enter this region ; this will allow the local lipid density to increase , while still covering the original area occupied by the outer monolayer .",
    "the peg concentration near the outer monolayers in region b is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the peg concentration near the outer monolayers in region a , @xmath8 is polymer correlation length , and @xmath7 is the distance between the bilayers in region b @xcite . since by the definition of region b , the bilayer spacing in that region is small , @xmath11 , we have @xmath22 and the peg concentration in region b is negligible ; we thus take this concentration to be zero . the energy per lipid in region",
    "b is _ initially _ given by @xmath23 , where @xmath15 is the lipid density in the absence of polymer .",
    "since the free energy per lipid , @xmath16 , is minimized when the density @xmath24 and the tension in region b initially vanishes , since either expansion or compression of the lipids will increase their energy .",
    "the tension gradient between regions a ( initially at negative tension ) and b ( initially at zero tension ) induces a flow of lipids from region b to region a. since region a is much larger than region b , we can treat it as a reservoir , and assume that even though lipid is flowing from region b to region a , the lipid density in region a is not changed from its initial value of @xmath15 .",
    "the system is a dynamical one and the chemical potential ( equivalent in our single component system to the free energy per lipid , @xmath16 ) is not constant in all of space at the mesoscopic scale ; this results in lipid flow and dynamics .",
    "however , since local equilibrium _ is _ maintained , we must have equal chemical potentials at any given point in the system .",
    "in particular , at the boundary between regions a and b , the chemical potentials of the lipids must be equal : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lipid density at the edge of region b. we note that this equality of chemical potentials determines the lipid density at the boundary of region b , @xmath27 ; the functional form of the two free energies @xmath10 and @xmath17 are not the same , since in region a , the lipids are in contact with polymer .    the initial lipid density in region b ( @xmath15 , which is the density at which the lipids self - assemble in water in the absence of polymer ) is higher than the lipid density at the ab boundary : @xmath28 .",
    "this inequality is a consequence of the fact that the tension at the boundary is negative , as shown in section [ sec : boundcond ] .",
    "more intuitively , the negative tension in region a tends to pull in additional lipids from the boundary region of region b into region a as explained above .",
    "this lipid flow reduces the lipid density at the boundary @xmath29 from @xmath15 to @xmath27 . in turn",
    ", the reduced lipid density at the boundary of regions a and b , ( @xmath30 ) induces a flow of lipids from the rest of region b towards the boundary .",
    "this is because the minimum energy state in region b is one where @xmath31 ; thus lipids from the entirety of region b flow to the boundary in an attempt to restore the lipid density there to values closer to @xmath15 .",
    "this flow , in turn , reduces the lipid density at the boundary between regions b and c ( the hemifusion region ) at @xmath32 , and lead to a negative tension that tends to expand region c.    at the boundary of regions b and c , the lipid density is determined by a force balance between the membrane negative tension ( arising from the lipids flowing to the ab boundary ) , that tends to expand region c , and the force exerted by the boundary ring around region c that tends to shrink it .",
    "the main contribution to the energy of this ring is of the tilt of the lipid tails imposed by the toroidal geometry .",
    "this tilt is needed in order to form the three - way junction of the boundary ring cross section while avoiding an intra - membrane void , which has a much higher energetic cost @xcite .",
    "the energetic cost of the tilt can be considered through the related intra - membrane strain and the adjacent stress tensor @xcite .",
    "we assume that for @xmath33 the energetic cost @xmath34 for a cross section of the bc boundary ring is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the ring energy is given by @xmath35 .",
    "the force per unit length that the ring exerts on region b of the membrane tends to shrink region c and pull region b in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "this force ( per unit length ) is @xmath37 and tends to shrink the boundary ring ; that is , the expansion of region c is energetically costly . in local equilibrium , this force is balanced by the surface tension @xmath38 , which may be considered as a two dimensional lateral lipid pressure , in region b of the monolayer that tends to expand the ring : @xmath39 negative tension in region b tends to cause this region to contract and thus provides a force in the @xmath40 direction , balancing the force due to the bc boundary .",
    "in this section we derive the dynamics that govern the expansion of the hemifusion region and predict the flow of lipids within the monolayer as a function of the lipid density and of time .",
    "there are three local , dissipative forces that oppose any lipid motion .",
    "* the stress , or force per unit area due to the viscosity of the water that is moved along with the lipids is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the water velocity and @xmath43 erg s/@xmath44 is the viscosity of water .",
    "the stress is of order @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the lipid velocity and @xmath7 is the spacing between the bilayers in region b. * the stress , or force per unit area due to the monolayer viscosity is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath1 is the monolayer friction coefficient @xcite .",
    "for a laminar flow we estimate this stress as @xmath48 ; that is , the relevant dimension is the size of region b in which there is monolayer flow . * the stress , or force per unit area that is due to the friction _ between _ the monolayers is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the friction coefficient .",
    "this stress depends only on the motion of the outer relative to the inner monolayer where there is no flow ; there is therefore no dependence of the length scale related to the geometry of the different regions .",
    "the friction between a dmpc monolayer and a supporting hts monolayer at @xmath51 is @xmath52erg s/@xmath53 , while for a supported ots monolayer the friction is @xmath54 erg s/@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the experiments of @xcite were carried out at @xmath55 .",
    "it has been observed that the diffusion coefficient of a molecule in a dmpc monolayer increases about three folds when @xmath56 is increased from @xmath55 to @xmath57 @xcite , which suggest a corresponding decrease in @xmath50 . in this work",
    "we use an estimated value of @xmath58 erg s/@xmath53 . for dmpc bilayers at @xmath59",
    "the bilayer viscosity is @xmath60 erg s/@xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the values relevant to the experiments of @xcite are @xmath62 cm and @xmath63 cm . with the estimates for the stress given above",
    ", we find that the frictional force due to relative motion of the two monolayers is much larger than either the lipid or water viscosity contributions to the stress .",
    "we thus neglect these latter two effects and predict the dynamics for a system where the only relevant dissipation is due to the relative friction between the monolayers .",
    "the lipid flow is induced by the tension gradient @xmath64 , and is opposed by the frictional @xmath65 .",
    "the force balance equation is @xmath66 in appendix [ ap : local ] we derive the lipid local dynamics using eq .",
    "[ eq : fb ] and the continuity equation .",
    "we consider the dynamics only to first order in the lipid density variations @xmath67 , which is known from experiments to be small . in @xcite a variation of @xmath68 was measured .",
    "to first order in @xmath69 the local dynamics has the form of a diffusion equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the harmonic spring constant of the monolayer . for a small density variation",
    "@xmath72 the surface energy cost is @xmath73 , and the related tension difference is @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the _ surface energy _ @xmath75 is the gibbs free energy per unit area , and is different then the _ surface tension _ @xmath76 , which has the thermodynamic role of the two dimensional pressure .",
    "we estimate @xmath77 using the phenomenological form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the effective surface tension of the hydrocarbon - water interface @xcite . the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : musigma ] accounts for the ( electrostatic ) effective head - group repulsion , while the first term represents the effective hydrocarbon - water repulsion .",
    "we note that this effective repulsion is smaller than the repulsion of the bare hydrocarbon - water interface , and has been estimated as @xmath80 erg/@xmath61 @xcite .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : musigma ] we obtain @xmath81 erg/@xmath61 . for @xmath58 erg s/@xmath53 the effective diffusion constant is @xmath82 @xmath83sec .",
    "this quantity is larger than the actual , microscopic diffusion constant measured for free liquid bilayers above the gel transition , that are of the order of @xmath84 @xmath83sec @xcite .",
    "the einstein relation is not applicable in our case , since the flow ( that happens to scale like diffusion ) of the lipids from the high to low density regions is not due to the random motion of the molecules , but due to the tension gradient @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , for a characteristic molecular area @xmath86 @xmath61 we find that the related energy per molecule is @xmath87 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the lipid density were already discussed in section [ sec : thmod ] and we review them here for convenience . the local tension equilibrium at the boundary with region a determines the local lipid density @xmath27 at @xmath13 .",
    "in appendix [ ap : local ] we show that the tension in the monolayer is given by @xmath88 since the tension in region a is negative , from the tension equality at the boundary we see that @xmath89 is negative .",
    "moreover , because the function @xmath10 has a minimum at @xmath15 it is convex in a neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath27 is in that neighborhood , then the condition @xmath90 yields that @xmath91 .    the boundary ring near the hemifusion region at @xmath14 exerts a force that opposes hemifusion expansion ; this is because the boundary energy of the hemifusion region is increased as this region grows .",
    "this force is locally balanced by the negative tension in region b where lipids are flowing towards region a. as lipids pass from region b to a the lipid density in region b decreases ; the tension in region b , and in particular near its boundary with region c , becomes more negative and pulls on region c causing its expansion .",
    "the density of lipids in region b at the boundary @xmath14 is determined from the force balance eq .",
    "[ eq : fbeq ] . using eq .",
    "[ eq : pl ] we may write eq .",
    "[ eq : fbeq ] as @xmath92    before the flow begins , the initial lipid density in region b is @xmath15 , which implies that @xmath93 . for this value of the lipid density",
    "there is zero tension in region b , the stalk does not expand and hemifusion does not develop . due to",
    "the tension gradient between region b and a , lipids flow out of region b and a negative tension is built up .",
    "if at a certain time the lipid density at @xmath32 is low enough so that eq .",
    "[ eq : bc1 ] is satisfied , the stalk begins to expand .",
    "after the flow of lipids is initiated , lipids are removed from region b as they flow towards region a and the lipid density in region b is lower than @xmath15 . the lipid density in region b can not , however , be smaller than the value of @xmath27 , because when @xmath94 the free energies per lipid in regions a and b are equal , and the flow stops .",
    "thus , we require @xmath95 in all of region b if there is to be flow and stalk expansion that leads to hemifusion . at an early time after the stalk formation , while the stalk does not expand , the lipid density in all of region b approaches the equilibrium density profile @xmath96 . using eq .",
    "[ eq : bc1 ] , the condition for the stalk to begin to expand with a finite amount of time is : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the radius of the stalk . in our model , we consider the process for @xmath14 much larger than the molecular size @xmath99 that characterizes the size of the stalk .",
    "the tilt energy @xmath34 is in general positive . from eqs .",
    "[ eq : pl ] and [ eq : inicond ] , for @xmath100 we have @xmath101 .",
    "since we consider all quantities only to first order in @xmath102 we use the approximation @xmath103 .    in appendix",
    "[ ap : global ] we use the integral continuity equation , that expresses the conservation the lipid number in the system , in order to obtain a dynamic equation for the hemifusion radius @xmath14 . in appendix",
    "[ ap : adiabatic ] we show that the time scale that governs the local dynamics is much faster then the rate of change of @xmath14 .",
    "we use an adiabatic approximation in order to solve the dynamics .",
    "first , we fix @xmath14 and find the asymptotic ( @xmath104 ) lipid density profile @xmath105 we use this density profile to obtain the dependence of the hemifusion radius @xmath14 on the time @xmath106 to find : @xmath107 this predicts an approximately square root dependence of the hemifusion region size on time ( with logarithmic corrections ) . the same temporal dependence was obtained by @xcite under the assumption of constant lateral lipid density .",
    "however , their result is quantitatively different from ours since they have considered the monolayer viscosity as the main dissipative force , while we have showed that it is negligible compared to the friction @xmath50 .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : taur ] we find that the time it takes the hemifusion region to evolve from the initial stalk radius @xmath108 to a final radius of @xmath109 is @xmath110 . with @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xmath83sec",
    ", we predict that the time for expansion of the hemifusion zone to a scale of @xmath113 m is @xmath114 sec .",
    "this is consistent with the experiment of @xcite where a time of @xmath115 sec was measured .",
    "the time @xmath116 found here can also be derived ( up to a numerical factor ) from a simple scaling argument , that does not depend on the specific details of our model .",
    "as hemifusion is initiated , the tension difference between the bulk ( at @xmath13 ) and the hemifusion front ( at @xmath14 ) is @xmath117 . when @xmath118 the average tension gradient is @xmath119 . for a fully damped flow with a friction coefficient",

    "initiation of stalk expansion is relevant not only to events of mesoscopic fusion , but also to in - vivo fusion events , where a fusion pore is formed soon after stalk expansion .",
    "in many cases of biological interest , the fusion process is regulated by fusion proteins that promote stalk formation and expansion .",
    "one hypothesized bio - molecular mechanism that promote expansion is the penetration of hydrophobic fusion protein domains into the membrane and its subsequent destabilization @xcite .",
    "the protein domains may increase the membrane surface energy by inducing an effective attraction of the hydrophobic head groups , similar to the effect of peg @xcite ; they may also penetrate the membrane , increasing the intra - membrane tension .",
    "our theory suggests that the former mechanism , which work to increase in @xmath127 , may be more effective energetically than the latter , which increases @xmath2 .",
    "that is , for a given change in lipid density , @xmath102 , a smaller energy is involved ( eq . [ eq : tendiff ] ) .",
    "snare proteins that promote exocytosis in nerve synapses are thought to induce stalk expansion through a conformational change by which the protein pull on the stalk to widen it @xcite .",
    "another possible cause for stalk expansion is calcium ions induced membrane tension @xcite .",
    "we conclude from our theory that the latter mechanism may be more effective energetically .",
    "in section [ sec : boundcond ] we found that in order for expansion of the hemifusion region to occur , the driving force due to the negative tension in region b must be large enough to overcome the tendency of the boundary of region c to shrink .",
    "we thus deduced that the normalized lipid density at @xmath13 must obey @xmath133 from this condition , we estimate the minimum stalk radius @xmath99 for which the lateral tension in the monolayer can induce expansion",
    ". the energy of the lipid tails tilt at the hemifusion front is estimated by @xcite as @xmath134 erg / cm .",
    "for the values of @xmath77 and @xmath102 given above , we find that the mechanism described here is sufficient to cause hemifusion for @xmath135 nm , which is of the order of the typical radius of a thermally nucleated stalk @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath102 vanishes ( that is , no polymer is present in region a ) hemifusion will not be initiated for any finite ( reasonable ) stalk radius .",
    "experiments have demonstrated that hemifusion may be caused by sufficiently large normal pressure @xcite or by negative pressure in the water layer @xcite .",
    "we shall now determine the conditions under which pressure induced in region b can in and of itself ( i.e. with no surface tension effects as induced by the added polymer ) cause hemifusion expansion by forcing water to flow out of the contact zone .",
    "we do this by using the simplifying assumption that the water in region b is under a constant pressure @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the normal pressure on the bilayers and @xmath138 is the osmotic pressure induced by the solute in the bulk .",
    "the finite thickness of the water layer in region b ( whose thickness is on the order of a nanometer ) is always maintained because of hydration forces : the water molecules are organized around the polar head groups of the lipids in order to partially cancel their electric dipole ; removing the water layer would increase the free energy because of the energetic cost of these electric dipoles whose normal components , in general , point to the same direction due to the hydrophobic nature of the lipid layer .",
    "thus the water flow out of region b and into region a is possible only by the expansion of region c.    the energy ( per unit area ) difference associated with a pressure difference of @xmath139 is @xmath140 , where @xmath7 is the distance between the two proximal monolayers .",
    "this should be compared with the energy difference @xmath127 associated with the free energy gradient in the monolayer . in the experiment of @xcite that yield",
    "@xmath141 erg/@xmath61 , which is of the same order of @xmath127 .",
    "nevertheless , we show below that the external normal pressure has only a minor effect on the pressure in the monolayer and on its density",
    ". we will thus show that under the experimental conditions of @xcite , the external pressure is _ insufficient _ to cause hemifusion expansion .    in the experiment of @xcite",
    "the applied normal pressure is @xmath142 atm and the osmotic pressure is @xmath143 atm , so the total pressure between the bilayers is @xmath144 atm .",
    "we now estimate the contribution of this pressure to the lipid density variation in the experiment . for a fluid membrane ,",
    "the relation between the tension @xmath38 - the two dimensional pressure in the membrane - to the three dimensional pressure @xmath139 , is @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the thickness of the monolayer . in order to induce the observed density variation @xmath147",
    "the tension needed is @xmath148 erg/@xmath61 . for @xmath149",
    "nm the pressure required to induce such tension is 5 atm  much larger than the actual pressure in the experiment .",
    "thus , the contribution of the normal and the osmotic pressures to the density variation is negligible compared with the surface tension effects due to the peg - lipid interactions that result in densification of the lipids .",
    "this result underscores the point made in sec .",
    "[ sec : init ] : changes in the pressure are much less effective than surface energy variation for the initiation of stalk expansion .",
    "we now estimate the pressure @xmath139 needed to initiate hemifusion , without a lipid density gradient ( that is , with @xmath150 ) . the radial force per unit",
    "length on the boundary at @xmath14 due to the external normal pressure is @xmath151 from eq .",

    "the pressure needed for the hemifusion of bilayers directly supported on mica ( with no added polymer or other mechanisms that give rise to lipid density gradients ) was found by @xcite to be @xmath155 atm .",
    "@xcite used a surface forces apparatus to apply pressure on dmpc bilayers supported on polymer layers .",
    "the polymer layer allowed the bilayers some lateral conformational freedom , thus permitting more freedom for the adjustment of stalk shape and size @xcite . in that case , where the stalk geometry could easily adjust",
    ", the cost for forming the stalk was reduced and hemifusion was observed at a much lower pressure of @xmath156 atm . in the experiment of @xcite the pressure @xmath157 atm is too low to be the driving force for hemifusion .",
    "pressure in itself is not enough to cause hemifusion , but it is sometimes necessary .",
    "@xcite showed that the amount of pressure needed for hemifusion is directly related to the lipid density near the contact area . in that experiment , two bilayers were brought into contact using a surface forces apparatus .",
    "when ca@xmath158 ions were introduced , there was a phase separation in the bilayers .",
    "the density of lipids in the bilayer regions that were brought into contact was characterized by the hydrophobic adhesion energy .",
    "when thinner regions were brought together ( characterized by adhesion energy of @xmath159 erg/@xmath61 ) they either hemifused spontaneously , or required only a small amount of pressure ( @xmath160 atm ) to induce hemifusion . for denser bilayers ( @xmath161 erg/@xmath61 ) a pressure of @xmath162 atm was required for hemifusion .",
    "@xcite induced negative osmotic pressure on the water layer between the bilayers by lowering the relative humidity of the environment of dphpc . at 80% humidity",
    "the lipids were at the lamellar phase .",
    "as the relative humidity was decreased the water were expelled from between the bilayers by the osmotic pressure and the lamella were connected by stalks , directly observed by x - ray diffraction . in this experiment",
    "the dehydration was due to negative pressure of the water layer induced by the reduced relative humidity , and not by normal pressure , but the physical effect of the two is similar .",
    "in this paper we used a model based on lipid density gradients induced by surface energy variation that occur far from the hemifusion zone , to predict the the conditions for the initiation of hemifusion by stalk expansion and the dynamics of mesoscopic hemifusion .",
    "our theory was motivated by the experiments of @xcite . however , the quantitative scheme presented here can be generalized to any system of two lipid bilayers initially connected by a stalk , where a perturbation in region a , mesoscopically far from the stalk , causes tension in the membrane in that region .",
    "for example one can apply our results to tension induced by the electrostatic interactions caused by calcium ions @xcite , tension induced by laser tweezers @xcite , or the effective tension induced by the attraction of oppositely charged bilayers @xcite .",
    "we have compared the effect of the friction of the two monolayers , the the water viscosity and the intra - monolayer viscosity on the two dimensional lipid motion and showed that the friction dominates .",
    "thus , the lipid dynamics depend on the friction and not on hydrodynamics .",
    "this means that the spacing between the two layers is irrelevant for the lipid dynamics .",
    "experiments similar to those of @xcite can test the predictions of the model for the time scales as functions of the lipid density and friction as well as the value of the driving force due to the tension induced in region a. one could vary each of the parameters @xmath102 ( the relative change in lipid density ) , @xmath77 ( related to the induced tension ) and @xmath50 ( the interlayer friction ) independently , and measure the hemifusion radius @xmath163 , the final radius @xmath13 and the time to complete the process @xmath116 as functions of these parameters .",
    "in particular , the friction @xmath50 can be varied independently of @xmath77 by changing the composition of the distal bilayers while maintaining the same composition of the proximal bilayers .",
    "the friction can be varied by changing the interactions between the chains that is responsible for most of the friction , via chain length changes or temperature changes @xcite .",
    "once an empirical , temporal profile for the hemifusion expansion , @xmath163 , is measured for systems with known parameters , one can use the same experiment to estimate the effective diffusion constant for the lipid flow , @xmath164 , for _ different _ lipid bilayers .",
    "one can easily vary the lipid density at the boundary , @xmath27 by changing the polymer ( or calcium ions ) concentration since the density @xmath27 is determined by the equality of the chemical potentials of the lipids exposed to the polymer and those exposed only to the water .",
    "the static part of our theory deals with the initial conditions required for stalk expansion .",
    "we have evaluated the necessary density variation @xmath165 and demonstrated that the related surface energy @xmath166 is much smaller then the surface tension @xmath167 .",
    "this result is not surprising , since it is a general result of a first order expansion around an energetic minimum .",
    "still , it does give a new insight regarding biological fusion mechanisms .",
    "it suggest mechanisms working through the change of the surface energy @xmath127 are much more effective than mechanisms that exert force or normal pressure on the stalk .",
    "the predicted dependence of stalk expansion on the lipid density can be tested by measuring the critical density @xmath102 at which stalk expansion occurs .",
    "the results may serve to learn more about the stalk structure and energetics .",
    "we expect that near the end of the process of hemifusion expansion , when @xmath168 experimental results may differ from our predictions , since the density profile of the polymer ( or calcium ions in the case of @xcite ) may vary in a gradual manner around @xmath13 ; in our theory we assumed a sharp ( step function ) decrease of the polymer density at @xmath13 .",
    "we also expect a deviation from our theory when the radius @xmath163 of the hemifusion region is close to its initial , molecular stalk radius @xmath99 , due to microscopic details of the lipid structure in the stalk .",
    "we distinguish between hemifusion induced by surface tension gradients , which we consider in our model , and hemifusion induced by pressure .",
    "hemifusion may be induced by normal pressure on the bilayers @xcite or by dehydration which induces negative pressure in the water layer between them @xcite .",
    "we showed that this pathway to hemifusion requires much more energy ( per unit area ) than fusion that is induced by surface tension gradients .",
    "we have shown that the induced pressure @xmath139 in the experiment of @xcite can not be the primary direct cause of hemifusion .",
    "still , pressure does play an important role in stalk formation .",
    "it may also effect stalk expansion through its effect on the lipid tilt energy @xmath34 and on the initial stalk radius @xmath99 .",
    "we bring here the full calculation of the local lipid dynamics . note",
    "that though in our final result we leave only the terms linear in @xmath69 , one may also calculate in the same framework the non linear terms in the case @xmath69 is not small .",
    "the force balance equation is @xmath169 and the continuity equation is @xmath170 writing the energy per lipid as @xmath10 the surface tension is @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the a macroscopic area and @xmath173 is the number of lipids in this area .    from eqs .",

    "in sec . [ sec : boundcond ] we consider the boundary conditions for the lipid density . in order to fully predict the dynamics of hemifusion expansion , we also need to determine the flow at the boundaries . for this",
    "we use the integral form of the continuity equation : @xmath176 the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : a_bc2 ] describes the rate of change of the lipid number in region b while the right hand side gives the flow of lipids through the boundary @xmath13 .",

    "equations [ eq : a_bc3 ] and [ eq : a_eqmot ] along with the boundary conditions completely determine the time evolution of the monolayers to first order in @xmath69 . from these equations",
    "we can calculate @xmath163 , and predict the temporal profile of hemifusion expansion .",
    "we write these two equations using dimensionless variables and scale the spatial variables so that they are of order of unity , in order to get an estimate of the time scales .",
    "the natural spatial scale is the final size of the hemifusion region , @xmath13 . we thus define : @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 as well as two time variables : a `` fast '' time @xmath184 at which the local lipid flow occurs , and a `` slow '' ( since @xmath102 is small ) time @xmath185 which is the scale over which the hemifusion region expands .",
    "[ eq : a_bc3 ] and [ eq : a_eqmot ] become @xmath186 @xmath187    since all the variables that appear on the right hand side of eqs .",
    "[ eq : a_nsc1 ] and [ eq : a_nsc2 ] are of order unity , the units of @xmath188 and @xmath189 suggest the time scales of the processes described by the equations .",
    "for @xmath190 we have @xmath191 , which implies that we can use an adiabatic approximation : the local lipid flow occurs quickly so that the lipid density is instantaneously given by the asymptotic equilibrium solution of eq .",
