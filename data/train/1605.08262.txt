    "we analyze the specific case where the isotropic interaction between particles favors a hexagonal ( or equilateral triangular ) lattice and subject it to a square substrate lattice with lattice constant @xmath3 and of varying strength @xmath2 , fixing the pressure @xmath5 such as to generate a commensurate density @xmath12 for the free hexagonal phase . increasing the substrate potential @xmath2",
    ", we find the complete pathway of transformations that takes the freely floating hexagonal phase at @xmath13 to the fully locked square phase at large @xmath2 .",
    "effects of discommensuration in periodic external potentials appear in numerous physical systems , prominent examples being atoms on surfaces , e.g. , krypton on graphite @xcite , vortices in modulated superconducting films @xcite and in periodic pinning arrays @xcite , flux quanta in josephson junction arrays @xcite , or colloidal monolayers on periodic substrates @xcite .",
    "recent applications of such ideas in cold gases are the theoretical analysis of vortex pinning in a bose - einstein condensate subject to an optical lattice @xcite or the proposal @xcite to realize this physics in a system of dipolar molecules @xcite subject to a square optical lattice @xcite ; the high tunability of these cold - gas systems @xcite then can be used to explore the various structural phases .",
    "another recent example is the study of graphene on boron nitride @xcite where novel electronic and optical properties can be found .",
    "the original ` misfit problem ' has been formulated in one dimension ( 1d ) and dealt with a particle lattice with lattice constant @xmath4 subject to a periodic substrate with incommensurate periodicity @xmath14 . as shown by frenkel and kontorova @xcite and by frank and van der merve @xcite , the locked system at large potential @xmath2 ( with particle separation @xmath3 )",
    "transforms into the free lattice at @xmath13 ( with separation @xmath4 between particles ) via a smooth commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "the intermediate non - uniform phase involves solitons with cores approximating the free phase and separating regions of locked phase ;",
    "the dense soliton array then approaches the free phase with lattice constant @xmath4 .",
    "the distortion of a two - dimensional particle lattice due to a weak substrate potential has been analyzed by mctague and novaco @xcite within a perturbative ( in small @xmath2 ) approach ( for lattices with equal symmetry ) ; the distorted lattice becomes orientationally locked to the substrate at a non - trivial angle @xmath15 that depends on the elastic properties of the lattice and on the misfit parameter .",
    "adapting this analysis to our situation , we find a locking angle @xmath11 between the height of the equilateral triangular unit cell and one of the main axes of the substrate potential , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dia ] .",
    "the commensurate ",
    "incommensurate transition in two dimensions ( 2d ) has been first addressed by pokrovsky and talapov @xcite within the so - called ` resonance approximation ' where only the leading harmonic of the substrate potential is accounted for . in this situation",
    ", the problem reduces to a 1d one and the system develops a secondary structure in the form of an array of soliton - lines .",
    "however , with only one substrate harmonic present , the commensurate phase at large potential @xmath2 is always a rhombic lattice with base @xmath16 ( we call it the @xmath17 rhombic lattice)in order to obtain the complete pathway connecting the hexagonal and square lattices , both harmonics have to be accounted for .    rather than starting from the free hexagonal phase and increasing the substrate potential @xmath2 , it is then more opportune to start from the locked square phase and decrease @xmath2 .",
    "as the square phase is merely stabilized by the large substrate potential , decreasing @xmath2 naturally generates an instability .",
    "it turns out that the leading instability appears at @xmath18 and is given by a shear distortion @xmath19 with amplitude @xmath20 parallel to the @xmath21-axis and a wave vector @xmath22 along @xmath23 residing at the brillouin zone boundary ( alternatively , the spontaneous symmetry breaking involves a distortion @xmath24 along @xmath23 with a wavevector @xmath25 along @xmath21 ) .",
    "the resulting zig - zag lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dia ] , exhibits a doubled unit cell and has been found before in the context of vortex pinning by a square - lattice pinning potential @xcite . together with the symmetry breaking defining the direction of period - doubling , a second spontaneous symmetry breaking fixes the sign of the amplitude @xmath20 , that defines two twin versions of the zig - zag phase . upon decreasing @xmath2",
    "further , the amplitude @xmath20 of the zig - zag distortion increases , assuming the value @xmath26 , and hence resulting in a rhombic ( or isosceles triangular ) lattice , at @xmath13 .",
    "although this lattice is close to the hexagonal one , it has the wrong symmetry and hence further transitions are needed to reach the free hexagonal phase .",
    "these transitions are of the commensurate - incommensurate type and the task is to find the most favorable soliton - line appearing first upon decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "while in one dimension only two types of point - solitons either diluting or compressing the particle chain by @xmath27 are possible , in two dimensions soliton - lines with different ` topological vector charge ' @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 mutually prime integers , can be conceived , where the vector charge defines the translation of the lattice on itself or on a twin after the passage of the soliton - line .",
    "thereby , shift vectors @xmath31 with odd values of @xmath32 are domain walls connecting unequal twins with @xmath33 , while even values of @xmath32 belong to solitons connecting same twins . out of the many candidate defects , we find that a dilution - type domain wall ( connecting two period - doubled twins ) with displacement vector @xmath34 is the most favorable defect appearing at the highest value @xmath35 .",
    "quite surprisingly , the domain wall array does not follow one of the symmetry axes of the parent crystal , although such symmetric arrangements have been predicted in the literature @xcite .",
    "when domain walls are flooding the lattice upon further decrease in @xmath2 , they wash out the substrate mode along the @xmath21-axis and the particle lattice approaches the @xmath17 rhombic phase resulting from the resonance approximation that neglects just this mode and has been encountered in the discussion further above .",
    "the further decrease in @xmath2 then follows the path described before , with the first pokrovsky - talapov type soliton appearing at @xmath36 and developing into the distorted and rotated hexagonal phase as the soliton density increases at small @xmath2 .",
    "note that the vector charge of the pokrovsky - talapov soliton - line has only one of its components quantized , @xmath37 with the shift @xmath38 along @xmath21 fixed by the elastic properties of the particle lattice but assuming any ( non - quantized ) value .",
