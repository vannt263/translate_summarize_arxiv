    "our optical tweezer is a far off - resonance dipole trap , with a size of about one micrometer .",
    "we produce this tweezer by focusing a laser beam down to the diffraction limit of a large numerical aperture aspherical lens .",
    "we use a lens manufactured by lightpath technologies with a numerical aperture of 0.5 .",
    "the working distance between the lens and the focal point is 6 mm , large enough to allow a good optical access around the lens .",
    "we have separately tested the lens using a wavefront analyzer . we have found a rms deviation of the resulting wavefront of less than @xmath0 over the whole numerical aperture , thus demonstrating that the aspherical lens is diffraction limited .    the optical layout , consisting of the aspherical lens and standard optical elements , is shown in figure  [ layout_aspherix ] .",
    "the dipole trap laser beam , produced by a 850 nm laser diode , is sent throught a single mode optical fiber and is shaped at the output of the fiber by a triplet lens .",
    "the beam goes through the viewport of the vacuum chamber inside which the aspherical lens is placed . before putting this system together ,",
    "we have checked on a separated bench that the whole optical system is diffraction limited ( see reference@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the same lens is used to collect the fluorescence light ( 780 nm ) emitted by the atom trapped in the tweezer .",
    "this fluorescence light is collected outside the vacuum chamber using a confocal imaging system , as represented in figure  [ layout_aspherix ] .",
    "the light is sent onto an avalanche photodiode , used in counting mode , and a ccd camera .",
    "this imaging system is also diffraction limited and has a spatial resolution of 1 micrometer@xcite  .",
    "we use this optical system to trap and observe single atoms in the tweezer .",
    "the tweezer is loaded from the cloud of rubidium atoms cooled in an optical molasses .",
    "figure  [ fluo_single_atom ] shows an example of the signal obtained on the avalanche photodiode versus time .",
    "the steps in the signal correspond to the fluorescence of a trapped atom at 780 nm , induced by the molasses laser .",
    "the absence of double steps is an indication that only individual atoms are trapped .",
    "this single - atom trapping is made possible by a `` blockade mechanism '' studied in detail in reference@xcite  .",
    "our quantum bit is encoded on the @xmath1 , @xmath2 hyperfine sublevels of a rubidium 87 atom .",
    "this choice of levels for the qubit provides the advantage of zero first - order sensitivity to magnetic fields .",
    "we initialize the qubit in state @xmath3 by optical pumping , with an efficiency of 85 % .",
    "we read the state of the qubit using a state selective measurement limited by the quantum projection noise .",
    "for this purpose , we send a laser on resonance with state @xmath4 and the state @xmath5 connected by a transition at 780 nm .",
    "radiation pressure expels the atom out of the trap , if the atom is initially in state @xmath4 .",
    "otherwise , if the atom is in state @xmath3 , the laser leaves the atom unaffected .",
    "we then check for the presence of the atom .",
    "this method therefore maps the internal state of the atom on the presence or the absence of the atom at the end of the sequence .",
    "we drive the qubit transition with two raman lasers , one of them being the dipole trap .",
    "the two beams are colinear and sent through the same optical fiber and the large numerical aperture lens . due to the tight focusing of the two lasers , we observe a rabi frequency of the two - photon transition as high as @xmath6 mhz .",
    "figure  [ rabi ] shows the population of state @xmath3 for two durations of the raman pulse@xcite  .",
    "we study the coherence of the quantum bit using ramsey spectroscopy .",
    "we apply a first @xmath7 raman pulse to prepare the atomic state @xmath8 .",
    "we let the system evolve and we apply a second @xmath7 pulse .",
    "the signal exhibits oscillations at a frequency given by the detuning of the raman lasers with respect to the qubit transition .",
    "the decay of the contrast of the oscillations as a function of the time interval between the two pulses is the signature of the loss of coherence .",
    "we attribute this decay to the residual motion of the atom in the trap , together with the fact that the two states of the qubit experience a slightly different trapping potential , leading to a dephasing of the quantum bit .",
    "our best @xmath9 dephasing time is @xmath10sec . for details ,",
    "see reference  @xcite  .",
    "we rephase this dephasing by inserting a @xmath11 pulse between the two @xmath7 pulses . using this spin - echo technique , we observe a revival of the oscillations after a time as long as 40 ms , corresponding to a 70 fold improvement with respect to the coherence time of the qubit , as shown in figure  [ spinecho ] .",
    "neutral atoms are promising candidates for the realization of a large - scale quantum register . to perform a quantum computation , a key feature is the ability to perform a gate between two arbitrary qubits of the register . as a first step ,",
    "we have demonstrated a scheme where the atomic qubit is transfered between two tweezers , and then transported over several tens of micrometers .",
    "we show that these manipulations of the external degrees of freedom preserve the coherence of the qubit , and do not induce any heating .",
    "the distance travelled is typical of the separation between atoms in an array of dipole traps .",
    "these techniques can also be useful to position an atom at the node of the electromagnetic field in an optical cavity for qed experiments@xcite  .    to show that the transfer preserves the coherence of the quantum bit",
    ", we prepare a superposition @xmath12 in a first tweezer using a first @xmath7 pulse .",
    "we then decrease the depth of the first tweezer while increasing the depth of a second tweezer superimposed with the first one . after a dwelling time of 200 @xmath13sec ,",
    "we transfer the atom back to the initial tweezer and apply a second @xmath7 pulse .",
    "we vary the time between the two pulses around 200 @xmath13sec and observe the corresponding ramsey oscillations .",
    "we have shown that the amplitude of the ramsey signal remains unchanged whatever the depth of the second trap is .",
    "we have also checked that when the depths of the two traps are identical , the `` temperature '' of the atom is unchanged .",
    "we have also moved the tweezer when the qubit is prepared in a superposition @xmath12 .",
    "we have transported the atom up to @xmath14 @xmath13 m away from the axis of the focusing lens , and brought it back to its initial position@xcite  .",
    "the entire round trip takes 6 ms .",
    "as this time is longer than the dephasing time of the quantum bit , we apply a @xmath11 pulse when the tweezer is at its turning point , as shown in figure  [ movingqubit ] .",
    "we have measured that the amplitude of the spin - echo signal remains constant when we varied the amplitude of the displacement .",
    "this indicates that the coherence of the quantum bit is preserved during the transport .",
    "finally , we have measured the phase of the ramsey sequence during the transfer experiment and the phase of the spin - echo signal during the transport .",
    "we have modelled this phase evolution and found a good agreement with the result of the experiment .",
    "this understanding of the phase is crucial for a possible implementation in a quantum computer where qubit phases need to be controlled .",
    "the ability to generate entanglement is a key feature that any physical system should exhibit to be useful for any quantum information processing task .",
    "for example , entanglement is essential in teleportation protocols between two parties .",
    "entanglement is also a necessary ingredient in the two approaches to quantum computing . in the quantum circuit",
    "approach@xcite  , entanglement is generated during the course of the implementation of the algorithms . in the cluster state",
    "approach@xcite  , it even constitutes the starting point of the calculation .",
    "it is therefore important to be able to generate and control the entanglement in this quantum system .    among all the methods proposed to entangle two neutral atoms ,",
    "conditional entanglement based on photon emission is promising , as it does not require any direct interaction between the atoms .",
    "a simplified scheme is presented in figure  [ conditional_entanglement ] ( see for example references@xcite ) .",
    "we isolate three levels in the atom .",
    "the upper level is connected to the two logic levels by an optical transition , with frequencies @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "each atom can decay to level @xmath3 and @xmath4 by emitting a photon with equal probability .",
    "the scheme entangles the internal state of the atom with the frequency of the emitted photon , generating for atom @xmath17 the state @xmath18 .",
    "the state of the two photons and two atoms @xmath17 and @xmath19 is therefore @xmath20 re - arranging the terms , this state can be re - written as @xmath21 when the two photons are recombined on a beam - splitter , a two - photon interference prevents coincidences on the two detectors when the two - photon state before the beam - splitter is @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the absence of simultaneous coincidence is also true when the two - photon state is @xmath24 , as the two - photon amplitudes of each component exactly cancel out ( see for example reference@xcite ) .",
    "therefore a simultaneous detection event on the two detectors heralds the preparation of the entangled atomic state @xmath25 . in this scheme ,",
    "two - photon interferences acts as a `` filter '' , and the preparation is heralded by the double detection .",
    "three ingredients are required to implement this protocol .",
    "the first one is the triggered emission of a single photon by a single atom .",
    "the second one is the observation of two photon interferences , and the third one is the ability to entangle an atom with an emitted photon . in the following sections we describe our implementation of the two first steps .",
    "we note that the third step has been realized by two groups in the recent years@xcite  .",
    "we control the emission of single photons by a single atom placed at the focal point of a large numerical aperture lens by sending @xmath11 pulse on the optical transition connecting @xmath26 and @xmath27 , see figure  [ single_photon_source ] .",
    "the duration of the pulses is 4 ns , and the separation between the pulses is 200 ns .",
    "the emitted photons all have the same @xmath28 polarization .",
    "we collect 0.6 % of the emitted photons on an avalanche photodiode .",
    "we have characterized the single - photon nature of the source by measuring the coincidences on two photodetectors placed in the imaging system  @xcite  .",
    "the resulting curve is shown in figure  [ single_photon_source](c ) .",
    "the absence of coincidence at zero delay is the signature that single photons are emitted by the atom .",
    "a careful analysis of this curve shows that the probability that the source emits two photons following the same excitation pulse is 1.8% .",
    "this number is in good agreement with a calculation taking into account the 4 ns duration of the excitation pulse , which is not negligible with respect to the 26 ns lifetime of the upper state .",
    "when two indistinguishable single photons are fed into the two input ports of a beam - splitter , the photons will leave together from the same output port .",
    "this is a quantum interference effect , which occurs because the two possible paths , where the photons leave in different output ports , interfere destructively .",
    "this effect was first observed in parametric downconversion by hong , ou and mandel@xcite  .",
    "we have shown the interference of two photons emitted by two atoms trapped in two tweezers separated by 6 microns ( see details in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the two atoms are excited by the same 2 ns - laser pulse following the procedure described in the previous section .",
    "we recombine the two photons of same polarization on an optical setup equivalent to a 50/50 beam - splitter and we measure the coincidences at zero delay on two photodiodes placed in the outpout ports of the beam - splitter , as represented in figure  [ two - photon_interference](a ) .",
    "if the two - photon interference were perfect , one should not measure any coincidence as the two photons must leave in the same output port .    to analyze the visibility of the interferences , we varied the spatial overlap between the photons propagating in free space . in order to do so , we translated the spatial mode of one photon with respect to the other one .",
    "the result is represented in figure  [ two - photon_interference](b ) . for our best overlap",
    ", we find a visibility of the interferences of 60% , coming from the difficulty to mode - match the two photons .",
    "this number is a measure of the indistinguishability of the two interfering photons .",
    "this mode - matching can be improved by coupling the photons to single mode fibers .",
    "we have demonstrated some basic manipulations of a single quantum bit encoded on an atom trapped in an optical tweezer .",
    "we have shown internal state rotation at the single atom level and we have measured the internal coherence of the qubit state . we have also demonstrated two necessary ingredients of a conditional entanglement protocol . our current estimate gives an efficiency to produce one entangled pair on the order of @xmath29 .",
    "we anticipate a rate of entangled pair production of one every 100 seconds .",
