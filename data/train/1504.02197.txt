    "monotone matrices arise in many areas of mathematics , such as stability analysis @xcite , and bounds for eigenvalues and singular values axels90,axels03 . in many applications ,",
    "one is interested in finding the smallest eigenvalue @xmath0 and the associated eigenvector @xmath1 of an irreducible nonsingular monotone matrix @xmath2 .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue @xmath3 of a monotone matrix @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the set of eigenvalues of @xmath4 . in @xcite , a real matrix @xmath4",
    "is called monotone if and only if @xmath7 is a non - negative matrix .",
    "the irreducible nonsingular @xmath8-matrices are one of the most important classes of matrices for applications such as discretized pdes , markov chains @xcite and electric circuits shi96 , and they have been studied extensively in the literature bpl94 .",
    "it is well known that there exist some monotone matrices that are not @xmath8-matrices , such as matrices that can be written as a product of @xmath8-matrices .",
    "there are some differences between an @xmath8-matrix and a monotone matrix .",
    "for example , an @xmath8-matrix can be expressed in the form @xmath9 with a non - negative matrix @xmath10 and some constant @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the spectral radius , see @xcite .",
    "thus , the smallest eigenvalue @xmath0 of an irreducible nonsingular @xmath8-matrix @xmath4 is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , the smallest eigenvalue of a monotone matrix @xmath4 can only be expressed as @xmath14 .",
    "however , the smallest eigenvalue retains the same properties @xcite , that is , the largest eigenvalue of an irreducible non - negative matrix @xmath7 is the perron root , which is simple and equal to the spectral radius of @xmath7 with a positive associated eigenvector .    for the computation of the perron vector of a non - negative matrix @xmath10 ,",
    "many methods exist @xcite but the power methods are not structure preserving and can not guarantee the desired positivity of approximations when the perron vector @xmath1 has very small components",
    ". therefore , a central concern is how to preserve strict positivity of approximations to the perron vector . in @xmath15",
    ", noda introduced an inverse iteration method with shifted rayleigh quotient - like approximations @xcite for non - negative matrix eigenvalue problems .",
    "this iteration method is called noda iteration ( ni ) , and it has also been adapted to the computation of the smallest eigenvalue and the eigenvector of an irreducible nonsingular @xmath8-matrix xue96,axy02 .",
    "the major advantages of noda iteration are structure preservation and global convergence .",
    "more precisely , it generates a monotonically decreasing sequence of approximate eigenvalues that is guaranteed to converge to @xmath16 , and maintains the positivity of approximate eigenvectors .",
    "furthermore , the convergence has been proven to be superlinear @xcite and asymptotically quadratic @xcite . in jia14 ,",
    "the authors introduced two inexact strategies for noda iteration , which are called inexact noda iteration ( ini ) to find the perron vector of a non - negative matrix ( or @xmath8-matrix ) .",
    "the proposed ini algorithms are practical , and they always preserve the positivity of approximate eigenvectors . moreover , the convergence of ini with these two strategies is globally linear and superlinear with convergence order @xmath17 , respectively .    in this paper , we propose an inexact noda iteration ( ini ) to find the smallest eigenvalue and the associated eigenvector of an irreducible monotone matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the major contribution of this paper is to provide two main relaxation steps for computing the smallest eigenvalue @xmath3 and the associated eigenvector @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the first step is to use @xmath18 as a stopping criterion for inner iterations , with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the current positive approximate eigenvector .",
    "the second step is to update the approximate eigenvalues by using the recurrence relations @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the next normalized positive approximate eigenvector , so resulting ini algorithms are structure preserving and globally convergent .",
    "the above parameter @xmath23 is called the relaxation factor .",
    "we then establish a rigorous convergence theory of ini with two different relaxation factors @xmath24 , and prove that the convergence of the resulting ini algorithms is globally linear , and superlinear with the relaxation factor @xmath24 as the convergence rate , respectively .",
    "in fact , the inner iterations of ini ( or ni ) require the solution of ill - conditioned linear systems when the sequence of approximate eigenvalues converges to @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) . in order to reduce the condition number of the inner linear system",
    ", we propose a modified noda iteration ( mni ) by using rank one update for the inner iterations , and we show that mni and ni are mathematically equivalent . for monotone matrix eigenvalue problems , we also develop an integrated algorithm that combines ini with mni , and we call this modified inexact noda iteration ( mini ) .",
    "this hybrid iterative method can significantly improve the condition number of inner linear systems of ini .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the noda iteration and some preliminaries .",
    "section 3 contains the new strategy for inexact noda iteration , and proves some basic properties for it . in section 4 ,",
    "we establish its convergence theory , and derive the asymptotic convergence factor precisely . in section 5",
    ", we present the integrated algorithm that combines ini with mni .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present some numerical examples illustrating the convergence theory and the effectiveness of ini , and we make some concluding remarks in section 7 .",
