    "then the tight frame @xmath141 that minimizes @xmath142 among all tight frames @xmath143 in @xmath138 is given by @xmath144 this can be easily seen by considering the vectors @xmath145 as rows of an @xmath132 matrix @xmath146 and using   with the frobenius norm , see also section  1.5 in  @xcite .",

    "the results in subsection  [ ss : rep ] imply that if @xmath42 is a tight frame for @xmath1 then @xmath154 is an orthogonal basis for its closed linear span .",

    "the number of flops for the matrix - multiplications and inversions in  , , and   depends on the chosen representation of the frame operator .",
    "note that for the proposed method this representation has to be computed for each iteration ( since we are dealing with a new frame in each iteration ) , which is not the case for the other two methods .",
