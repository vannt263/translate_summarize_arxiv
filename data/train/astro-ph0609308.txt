    "@xcite reported the existence of mysterious x - ray contamination episodes in the _ rosat _ all sky survey data which they termed long - term enhancements ( ltes ) . during an lte , the x - ray counting rate in the lower energy bands as much as doubled on a time scale of 12  days .",
    "however , they could not find any correlation with other observational parameters , such as spacecraft position or look direction .",
    "new insight on ltes was obtained by the discovery of x - ray emission from comet hyakutake ( @xcite ) . following the discovery ,",
    "x - rays were detected from many comets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the emission mechanism is now well understood as charge exchange of solar - wind heavy ions with cometary neutrals ( see @xcite for a review ) . then @xcite and @xcite suggested that solar - wind charge exchange with neutrals in the earth s geocorona and in the heliosphere accounts for a part of soft x - ray background below 1  kev .",
    "@xcite showed that the ltes of the _ rosat _ all sky survey data were well correlated with the solar - wind proton flux , which strongly suggests the origin of the ltes to be solar - wind charge exchange with h in the geocorona .",
    "solar - wind charge exchange results in line emission from highly ionized ions ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "_ rosat _ did not have enough spectral resolution to resolve those lines .",
    "spectral information on geocoronal solar - wind charge exchange was first obtained during a _ chandra _ dark moon observation @xcite .",
    "the x - ray photons detected in the direction of the dark moon are most likely from this source .",
    "the emission spectrum could be described by a sum of c , o , and o k - lines , although the statistics and energy resolution were limited .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported time variation of soft x - ray intensity during the _ xmm - newton _ _ hubble _ deep field north observation .",
    "the enhancement was correlated with solar - wind proton flux variations .",
    "they detected c , o , o , ne , and mg emission lines in the enhancement .",
    "the importance of solar - wind charge - exchange emission is three - fold .",
    "firstly , it will enable us to remotely study low density neutrals in geocorona , in outer atmosphere of planets such as jupiter , in interplanetary space , and in particular , around comets .",
    "secondly , it can be used as a highly sensitive ion probe for the solar wind .",
    "perhaps most importantly , it becomes a significant contaminating foreground in the study of the cosmic soft x - ray background below @xmath7 1  kev .",
    "more than half of the soft x - ray background at these energies is considered to arise from hot gas in the disk and halo of our galaxy and in intergalactic space .",
    "although such emission was detected early in the history of x - ray astronomy ( e.g. @xcite ) , its origins and the physical state of the hot gas are not yet well understood .",
    "geocoronal interactions with the solar wind produce at least a sporadic contamination that must be avoided in observations of any extended source . charge exchange with interstellar neutrals moving through the heliosphere creates a more subtle contribution where much of the diagnostic rapid time variation is washed out by the large travel time of solar - wind events through interplanetary space , and the spectral lines arise from the same ions expected in hot interstellar plasmas .",
    "@xcite used a simplified model of interplanetary charge exchange to estimate that essentially all of the minimum flux observed near the galactic plane in the 1/4  kev ( r12 ) band of the _ rosat _ sky survey could arise from this source ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we are far from an understanding of solar - wind charge exchange adequate to determine the true extent of this contribution .    the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) on board _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite has a significantly improved spectral line response function compared to previous x - ray ccd cameras , particularly below 1  kev @xcite .",
    "together with the large effective area of the x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; @xcite ) , this will open a new era for the study of soft x - ray background . in this paper",
    ", we report on _ suzaku _ observations of a blank field in direction of the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) .",
    "we detected a significant enhancement of the soft x - ray flux lasting for @xmath5  hours .",
    "the enhancement is mostly explained by increases in c through mg emission lines . during the enhancement , both c @xmath8 to 1 and c @xmath9 to 1 transition lines",
    "were clearly detected , which is a firm evidence for charge - exchange emission .",
    "we consider that the emission is due to the charge - exchange interaction of solar - wind heavy ions with neutrals in the magnetosheath at 28 earth radii ( @xmath10 ) . in this paper , we will concentrate on the x - ray spectra and the emission processes , and their implications for cosmic x - ray observations . the geophysical implications of the results will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "errors quoted in the text and tables are at 90% confidence single parameter errors and at @xmath11 confidence level in the figures , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the nep region was observed with _ suzaku _",
    "twice during the science working group ( swg ) observation time . the xis was set to normal clocking mode and the data format was either @xmath12 or @xmath13 . a log of the observations is shown in table  [ tab : obslog ] . in this paper , we concentrate on the spectral change during a `` flare '' detected in the first observation . for that purpose , we try to model the stable components , and then evaluate the spectral change .",
    "we use the data from the backside - illuminated ccd ( xis1 ) , because of its much superior performance below 1  kev @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      we used version 0.6 processed _ suzaku",
    "_ data  ev at the iron k@xmath14 energy and @xmath15  ev below 1  kev is achieved for the xis data @xcite . in this paper , we used version 0.6 data where the energy scale of the xis data are less accurate ( @xmath16  ev below 1  kev ) than that of version 0.7 , because the empirical model of the contamination distribution was obtained based on version 0.6 data . instead , we adjusted the scale and the offset of the response matrix , as shown in section  [ sec : data_reduction ] . ] .",
    "in addition to the standard data selection criteria : elevation from sunlit earth rim @xmath17 , elevation from dark earth rim @xmath18 , we applied cutoff rigidity ( cor ) @xmath19 to clean the xis data .",
    "the xis pulse height data for each x - ray event ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 format ) were converted to pi ( pulse invariant ) channels using the ` xispi ' software version 2005 - 12 - 26 and cti parameters from 2006 - 01 - 25 .",
    "we first created a time history of the x - ray counting rate by binning the event data into 256  s time bins . in figure",
    "[ fig : light_curve ] , we show the 0.32  kev counting rate of xis1 where the non - x - ray ( particle - induced ) background rate is not subtracted .",
    "the counting rate shows a clear enhancement in the first @xmath20  s. the particle background rate of the xis is known to vary because the cosmic ray flux changes as a function of the spacecraft position over the earth .",
    "the background rate is well reproduced as a consistent function of the local cutoff rigidity . from the xis data during intervals",
    "when the telescope is pointed at the dark side of the earth , we found that the 0.32  kev xis1 non - x - ray counting rate varies only from 0.03  ctss@xmath21 to 0.07  ctss@xmath21 when the cutoff rigidity varies from 15 to 6  gv . thus the observed enhancement can not be particle background variation .",
    "the enhancement lasted for @xmath5  hours . within the enhancement",
    "there are shorter time variations .",
    "for example , there are sharp spikes just before and after the highest peak at @xmath22  s. a time scale of these variations is as short as @xmath5  minutes .",
    "we defined the `` flare '' interval to be 0 to @xmath23  s and the `` stable '' interval as @xmath23 to @xmath24  s as shown in figure  [ fig : light_curve ] , then created x - ray images for `` flare '' and `` stable '' periods separately .",
    "the images in figure  [ fig : images ] show that the enhancement is not due to changes in any discrete sources .",
    "( 80mm,120mm)figure-1.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure-2a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure-2b.eps    we subtracted the particle background from both `` stable '' and `` flare '' spectra using the dark earth data with the same distribution of cutoff rigidities",
    ". the counting rates of the background subtracted spectra above 10  kev , where the data are dominated by non x - ray background events , are @xmath25  ctss@xmath21 for `` flare '' and @xmath26  ctss@xmath21 for `` stable '' , where the error is @xmath11 statistical error .",
    "these correspond to 6% and 2% of the counting rates of the dark earth data , respectively .",
    "note that , in the 25  kev band , change of the spectral model due to this background difference is much smaller than the statistical error , and hence , they do not affect the results in the later sections .",
    "since we suppose the diffuse x - ray emission to be approximately uniform over the field of view of the xis , we created an x - ray telescope ( xrt ) response function , or more specifically , an ancillary response file ( arf ) used in the xspec spectral fit software @xcite , for a flat field , using the xis arf builder software _",
    "it is known that contamination has been accumulating on the optical blocking filters of the xis sensors since the detector doors were opened following the launch , and that it accumulates much more quickly at the center of the field of view than at the outside @xcite .",
    "we used the contaminant thickness and radial distribution functions version 2006 - 05 - 28 when we built an arf with _",
    "xissimarfgen_. at the early time of this nep observation , the contaminant column densities were only @xmath27  carbon  atoms  @xmath28 and @xmath29  oxygen  atoms  @xmath28 at the center for xis1 .",
    "this reduces the efficiency by about 12% at the energy of c ( 367  ev ) , 6% at o ( 561  ev ) , 4% at o ( 653  ev ) , and @xmath30% at ne ( 905  ev ) and higher energies .",
    "systematic errors in the contaminant thickness are estimated to be about 10% .",
    "the transmission uncertainty due to this systematic error is only 1% for c , and less for lines at higher energies ; hence it is negligible compared with other errors . for the xis response function , we used the ae_xi1_20060213c.rmf file supplied by the xis team , with energy scale corrections of slope 0.9948 and offset @xmath31  kev as determined through the iterative analysis described in the next section .",
    "we then performed spectral fits to the `` stable '' spectrum .",
    "we first restricted the fitting energy range to 25  kev . in this range",
    "the emission is dominated by the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , which is largely emission from unresolved agns and can be represented by a power law function absorbed by neutral material along the line of sight through our galaxy .",
    "we thus fitted the spectrum with a power - law function with absorption by a neutral medium with solar abundances @xcite and fixed the absorbing column density at the total galactic value in this direction @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the fit results are summarized in the second column of table  [ tab : fits_stable ] .",

    "it is clear that there is additional emission below 1 kev and the excess contains emission lines such as o , o and ne k@xmath14 .",
    "thus , fixing the spectral parameters of the cxb component to the best fit values of the 25  kev fit , we added a thin thermal emission component using the mekal model ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fixed the abundance of o at the solar value , and set abundances of other elements ( c , n , ne , fe ) free .",
    "the version 0.6 xis data products are known to contain systematic energy calibration errors of @xmath5  ev amplitude below @xmath47  kev .",
    "we therefore adjusted the energy scale by varying the gain slope and offset as free parameters of the fit .",

    "@xcite attributed a weak peak structure found in the xmm - newton spectrum of comet c/2000 to a sum of c ly@xmath73 and ly@xmath72 , and c ly@xmath72 due to charge - exchange emission between the highly ionized solar wind and exospheric or interplanetary neutrals during an xmm - newton observation of the hubble deep field ",
    "north was reported by @xcite .",
    "this nep observation , however , seems to be the clearest detection so far .",
    "we also have detected o to mg lines .",
    "the lines at 796 and 882 ev  are likely to represent complex structures due to fe - l and other lines .",
    "the short ( @xmath5  minutes ) time scale variations observed during the enhancement of x - ray intensity imply that the size of the emission region is no larger than 10 light minutes . on the other hand",
    ", the apparent size of the emission region must be equal to or larger than the xis field of view ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these require the emitter of the x - ray enhancement to be within a distance of @xmath78 , or @xmath79  pc .",
    "because the enhanced x - ray emission consists of emission lines from c to mg , this requires an ion source within @xmath80  pc .",
    "there is only one ion source in this distance range . that is the sun .",
    "the sun may produce x - ray emission lines in our observations in two possible ways : scattering of solar x - rays by the earth s atmosphere , and solar - wind charge exchange . in the former case ,",
    "the x - ray intensity is proportional to the solar x - ray intensity multiplied by the sunlit atmospheric column density .",
    "the solar x - ray intensity is continuously monitored by the goes ( geostationary operational environmental satellites ) , but data show no correlation with the enhancement . moreover , using the msis atmosphere model @xcite , we found that the column density of sunlit atmosphere varied by many orders of magnitude ( @xmath81 ) during the observations , but no correlation was found with the observed x - ray intensity . thus scattering of solar x - rays can be excluded .        in figure",
    "[ fig : light_curve ] , we show the proton flux observed by the ace ( advanced composition explorer ) together with the _ suzaku _ x - ray counting rate .",
    "the ace data were shifted in time to account for propagation time from ace to the earth .",
    "clearly the proton flux was enhanced during the x - ray `` flare '' .",
    "this is consistent with solar - wind charge - exchange model .",
    "charge - exchange x - ray emission also is strongly supported by the detection of the c @xmath9 to 1 transition line ( ly@xmath72 ) . in cie ( collisional ionization equilibrium )",
    "thermal emission , the ly@xmath73 and ly@xmath72 lines of c are suppressed relative to ly@xmath14 by the boltzmann factor in the distribution of exciting electrons . in charge exchange between c and h ,",
    "the electron is deposited primarily in the @xmath9 level ( @xcite and references therein ) , and the x - ray lines are produced when it cascades to the @xmath82 level , guided only by branching ratios . in high energy collisions , angular momentum states are tend to be populated statistically by weight of the state s degeneracy , and electrons are primarily captured into maximal @xmath83 , where @xmath84 can change only by 1 unit at a time during the cascade @xcite , again resulting in relatively weak ly@xmath73 and ly@xmath72 . behind the earth s bow shock , however , the solar wind velocity is reduced , which should result in recombination into low @xmath83-orbitals and strong ly@xmath73 and ly@xmath72 . in the `` flare '' spectrum ,",
    "both c ly@xmath14 and ly@xmath72 lines were detected and this is a strong evidence for charge exchange .",
    "in addition , o @xmath74 to 1 and @xmath85 to 1 transition lines are also enhanced in the comet emission model @xcite . however , we can not separate those lines from fe - l emission lines with the present energy resolution .",
    "although x - ray intensity and the proton flux are correlated on a time scale of @xmath5 hours , they do not show much correlation on short time scales .",
    "we consider that the short term x - ray intensity variation is at least partly arising from orbital motion of the spacecraft . in figure",
    "[ fig : magneto ] , we show the geocentric distance of the point whose geomagnetic field becomes open to the space for the first time along the line of sight from the spacecraft position , i.e. , the point where the line of sight encounters the magnetosheath ( see also the schematic view shown in figure  [ fig : magneto_schematic ] for the definition ) .",
    "we evaluated the end point of the magnetic field using the software geopack-2005 and t96 magnetic field model ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we obtained the solar - wind parameters required to perform the calculation from the cdaweb ( coordinated data analysis web ) .",
    "we find that the line of sight during the present observation was rather special in the sense that it goes through the north magnetic pole region where charged particles of the magnetosheath can penetrate down to 2@xmath86 moving along open field lines .",
    "the short - term x - ray intensity variations during the time intervals shown by boxes in figure [ fig : magneto ] indicate anti - correlation with the distance to the magnetosheath .",
    "this indicates that the charge exchange of solar - wind heavy ions is taking place at 2@xmath86 where the neutral matter density is high .",
    "@xcite recently studied theoretically solar - wind charge - exchange emission from the magnetosheath .",
    "implications of the present results on the solar - wind ion composition and the earth s magnetosheath including comparisons with the theoretical model will be reported in a separate paper .",
