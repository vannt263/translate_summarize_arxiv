    "over one hundred years ago , the italian economist vilfredo pareto  @xcite made one of the first empirical studies of the distribution of wealth by undertaking a careful study of land ownership in italy , switzerland and germany .",
    "in the course of this study , he plotted the fraction of economic agents   with land holdings worth more than @xmath1 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "his studies led him to believe that this function , which we shall denote by @xmath2 has a universal form .    by its definition , it is clear that @xmath3 is monotone non - increasing , and that @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "what pareto observed is that @xmath2 is approximately equal to one for all @xmath1 less than a certain cutoff value denoted by @xmath6 , and decays as a power law for @xmath7 .",
    "that is , pareto s empirical observations led him to conclude that it is approximately true that @xmath8 the power @xmath9 is usually called the pareto exponent .    to put pareto s observations in modern terms , we may note that @xmath10 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of economic agents , ordered by wealth .",
    "let us denote the corresponding probability density function ( pdf ) of agents by @xmath11 , but we shall adopt the convention of normalizing @xmath12 to the total number of economic agents , rather than to unity , so that @xmath13 is the total number of agents with wealth in @xmath14 $ ] , for @xmath15 .",
    "the total number of economic agents is given by the zeroth moment of the pdf of agents , @xmath16 and the total amount of wealth in the economy is given by the first moment , @xmath17 with the above nomenclature established , the function that pareto plotted is @xmath18 from the fundamental theorem of calculus , we see that the pdf of agents is related to the derivative of pareto s function by   exist , at least in the distributional sense . ]",
    "@xmath19 in terms of the pdf of agents , pareto s empirical observation is then @xmath20    the ubiquity of the pareto distribution is indeed a very fundamental observation of macroeconomics , but it has resisted a microeconomic explanation for most of the last century .",
    "recent work  @xcite has suggested that the shape of pareto s curve is due to the fact that wealth distributions satisfy a certain boltzmann equation . before describing this boltzmann equation ,",
    "we first examine another common quantification of inequality .",
    "in 1906 , at approximately the same time as pareto was making his observations in europe , the american economist max o. lorenz was completing his dissertation work at the university of wisconsin madison in which he plotted the cumulative distribution of wealth versus the cumulative distribution of agents .",
    "that is , lorenz plotted the quantity @xmath21 versus the quantity @xmath22 both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are monotone nondecreasing , and they increase from zero to one as @xmath1 goes from zero to infinity .",
    "this graph , which has come to be called the _ lorenz curve _ , can be plotted in the unit square , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto - lorenz ] .     is plotted on the abscissa , while that of wealth @xmath23 is plotted on the ordinate .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 ranges from zero in the lower left corner of the figure , to infinity at the upper right .",
    "the diagonal blue line connecting those two corners corresponds to complete economic equality , in which all agents have the same amount of wealth .",
    "the orange curve is a more realistic depiction of the distribution of wealth in a society .",
    "the fraction of the triangular area under the diagonal that is shaded in blue is the gini coefficient . ]",
    "if all wealth in a society were equally distributed , the lorenz curve would be the diagonal line , plotted in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto - lorenz ] .",
    "this is because any fraction @xmath25 $ ] of the agents would possess the same fraction @xmath26 of the total wealth . in real economies",
    ", this curve always lies below the diagonal , more like the orange curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto - lorenz ] .    to prove that the lorenz curve can never pass above the diagonal ,",
    "note first that @xmath27 so the slope of the lorenz curve is given by @xmath28 which is the ratio of the wealth @xmath1 corresponding to that point on the curve to the average wealth .",
    "it follows that @xmath29 where we have abused notation , in that @xmath30 is now considered a function of @xmath31 .",
    "we see that @xmath32 when @xmath33 , and that @xmath34 when @xmath35 , and moreover that @xmath36 is concave up .",
    "it follows that @xmath36 is bounded above by the diagonal .",
    "equations ( [ eq : dl ] ) and ( [ eq : df ] ) relate the quantities plotted in the lorenz curve to @xmath11 , and we may also note that @xmath37 thus , given @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we see that any of the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath11 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be derived from any other , so they all contain equivalent information  which is to say that they all contain essentially complete information about the distribution of wealth in a society .",
    "in fact , actual data for wealth distributions in the world today is very scant , and economists have to content themselves with much coarser characterizations of wealth inequality than the quantities described above .",
    "one of the most popular of these is due to the italian statistician and sociologist corrado gini , who also worked roughly contemporaneously with pareto and lorenz .    the _ gini coefficient _",
    "@xmath40 is defined as the ratio of the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto - lorenz ] , lying between the diagonal segment and the lorenz curve .",
    "consequently , @xmath41 when everybody has equal wealth ; the limit @xmath42 describes the approach to complete oligarchy .    in terms of the quantities defined above , the gini coefficient is given by @xmath43 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dl ] ) and ( [ eq : df ] ) , we can change integration variables from @xmath31 to @xmath1 to find @xmath44 alternatively , changing the order of integration yields @xmath45 where we have changed the remaining variable of integration from @xmath46 to @xmath1 in the rightmost expression .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gini1 ] ) indicates that @xmath47 , where the angle brackets denote an average over the pdf @xmath12 .",
    "likewise , eq .  ( [ eq : gini2 ] ) indicates that @xmath48 . from these fundamental relationships between the gini coefficient and the functions introduced earlier , we see that @xmath40 is a quadratic functional of @xmath12 , and we may sometimes emphasize this functional dependence by writing it as @xmath49 $ ] .    in what follows , we shall need the _ frchet derivative _ of @xmath49 $ ] with respect to @xmath12 , which is the analog of the gradient in function space .",
    "this is defined by noting that , for any sufficiently well behaved function @xmath50 , @xmath51 - g[p ] \\right)\\ ] ] is a linear functional of @xmath52 . as such , by the riesz representation theorem , it can be expressed as the inner product of @xmath52 and a quantity which we shall denote by @xmath53 ; that is , for all sufficiently well behaved functions @xmath52 , the relation @xmath54 - g[p ] \\right)\\ ] ] defines the frchet derivative , @xmath53 , where the parentheses on the left indicate the standard @xmath55 inner product .",
    "this may be thought of as the infinite - dimensional version of @xmath56 for a scalar function @xmath57 .",
    "applying the above definition to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gini2 ] ) , it is a straightforward calculation to find @xmath58 .",
    "\\label{eq : frechet}\\ ] ] now , if the pdf , @xmath12 , changes in time , it will cause a change in the gini coefficient given by @xmath59 which is an infinite - dimensional version of the ordinary chain rule , @xmath60 in the next two sections , we shall consider two different dynamical equations for @xmath12 , and use them along with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dgdt ] ) to place bounds on @xmath61 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , though pareto s law is over a century old , an explanation for it in terms of microeconomic exchange relations between individual agents is still elusive .",
    "the general idea that simple rules for asset exchange might be used to explain wealth distributions appears to be due to angle  @xcite in 1986 .",
    "such models have come to be called _ asset - exchange models _ ( aems ) and they typically involve binary transactions between agents involving some increment of wealth @xmath62 , with rules for which agent gains it and which agent loses it . the first work applying the mathematical methods of kinetic theory to such models is the paper of ispolatov , krapivsky and redner  @xcite in 1998 .",
    "they considered an aem model in which the agent who loses the wealth is selected with even odds , and in which @xmath62 was proportional to the wealth of the losing agent .",
    "writing in a popular article in 2002 , hayes  @xcite noted that in an economy governed by this model , no agent would willingly trade with a poorer agent , and therefore would try to use deception to trade only with wealthier agents .",
    "for this reason , he named the model of ispolatov et al . the _ theft - and - fraud model _",
    "( tfm ) .    in the same article",
    "mentioned above , hayes  @xcite proposed a variant of the tfm , in which the losing agent is still selected with even odds , but in which @xmath62 is proportional to the wealth of the poorer agent , rather than that of the losing agent .",
    "he referred to this as the _ yard - sale model _",
    "( ysm ) and noted that it describes an economy in which rich and poor will have no strategic reason not to trade with each other .",
    "the first kinetic theoretical description of the ysm was given by boghosian in 2014  @xcite .",
    "in analogy with @xcite , he derived a boltzmann equation for the ysm , but then went on to show that in the limit of small @xmath62 and frequent transactions , this reduced to a certain nonlinear , nonlocal fokker - planck equation .",
    "he presented numerical evidence indicating that the ysm by itself exhibits `` wealth condensation , '' in which all the wealth ends up in the hands of a single oligarch .",
    "he also showed that , when supplemented with a simple model for redistribution , the ysm yields pareto - like wealth distributions , including a cutoff at low wealth and an approximate power law at large wealth , very reminiscent of eq .",
    "( [ eq : parteopdf ] ) .",
    "the ysm can be described by a very simple algorithm .",
    "the version of the algorithm we shall use here is completely equivalent to that described by boghosian  @xcite , though we state it in the following slightly different fashion : choose two agents from the population at random to engage in a financial transaction .",
    "call them agent 1 and agent 2 , and denote their respective wealth values by @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the amount of wealth that will be transferred from agent 1 to agent 2 in this transaction is then @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is sampled from a _ symmetric _ probability density function denoted by @xmath67 .",
    "note that , because @xmath67 is symmetric , the two agents both have even odds of winning and losing .",
    "it may seem odd that an algorithm which gives even odds of winning to both agents engaging in a transaction would cause wealth to concentrate , but this is indeed the case .",
    "this was demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations in @xcite , and there it was conjectured that the time - asymptotic state of @xmath11 is a generalized function , with support at @xmath33 , zeroth and first moments given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , and possibly divergent higher moments .",
    "this corresponds to an oligarchical state with @xmath68 . in this paper",
    ", we confirm that conjecture by demonstrating that the gini coefficient is a monotone increasing lyapunov functional of the boltzmann equation for the ysm , and that it reaches a maximum value of @xmath68 in the above - described oligarchical state .",
    "the boltzmann equation of the yard - sale model of asset exchange may be written @xmath69 + \\frac{1}{n}\\int_0^{\\frac{w}{1+\\beta}}dx \\ ; p(x ) \\left[p(w-\\beta x)-\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}p\\left(\\frac{w}{1+\\beta}\\right)\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : boltzmann}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the symmetric distribution described in the last section .",
    "this was derived by boghosian  @xcite using arguments similar to the derivation of the molecular boltzmann equation and also using a master equation approach , and so we shall not re - derive it in this paper . instead",
    ", we shall demonstrate that the gini coefficient is a lyapunov function for this equation .",
    "that is , we shall show that @xmath40 is monotone non - decreasing as a consequence of the above dynamics for @xmath12 .",
    "the lyapunov function of the molecular boltzmann equation is traditionally called boltzmann s `` @xmath0 function . ''",
    "adopting that nomenclature , we will show that the gini coefficient is an @xmath0 function for the yard - sale model boltzmann equation .",
    "our first task will be to substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) into eq .",
