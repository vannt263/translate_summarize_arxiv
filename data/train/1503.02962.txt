    "the vacuum fluctuations of the quantized electromagnetic field give rise a number of physical effects , including the casimir effect , the lamb shift , and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "many of these effects are calculated in perturbative quantum electrodynamics , often by a procedure which does not easily lend itself to an interpretation in terms of field fluctuations .",
    "an exception is welton s  @xcite calculation of the dominant contribution to the lamb shift , which leads to a simple physical picture in which electric field fluctuations cause an electron in the @xmath0 state of hydrogen to be shifted upwards in energy .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper will be to seek additional examples of this type .",
    "it is well known that time averaging of quantum fields is needed to produce mathematically well defined operators .",
    "usually , a test function of compact support is employed for this purpose  @xcite . however , in rigorous quantum field theory , this is a formal device which is not given a physical interpretation . in a recent paper  @xcite , it was suggested that the test , or sampling functions can have a physical meaning .",
    "this paper deals with the propagation of pulses in nonlinear optical materials and suggests that time averaged vacuum fluctuations of the electric field can alter the pulse propagation time inside the material .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite hypothesizes that the sampling function is determined by the geometry of the nonlinear material . in the present paper",
    ", we will explore this hypothesis in a different context , that of electron scattering by a potential barrier .",
    "we will be concerned with the vacuum fluctuations of the electric field in a particular direction .",
    "let @xmath1 be a cartesian component of the quantum electric field , such as the @xmath2-component .",
    "we wish to average this operator over a timelike world line . by going to the rest frame of an observer moving on this worldline",
    ", the averaging can be in time alone at a fixed spatial coordinate .",
    "let @xmath3 be a sampling function of characteristic width @xmath4 , whose time integral is unity @xmath5 we define the averaged electric field component by @xmath6 both @xmath1 and @xmath7 have a vanishing mean value in the vacuum state @xmath8 however , @xmath9 is infinite , while mean squared value of the averaged field is finite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a dimensionless constant determined by the explicit form of the sampling function .",
    "( lorentz - heaviside units with @xmath12 will be used here , so the electric field has dimensions of inverse time squared or inverse length squared . ) note that the mean squared value of the averaged electric field scales as @xmath13 , so shorter sampling times lead to larger fluctuations due to the contribution of higher frequency modes .",
    "typical values of @xmath11 are somewhat less than one . for example , @xmath14 for the gaussian sampling function , @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to define a dimensionless variable by @xmath16 the moments of @xmath17 , and hence of @xmath7 , are those of a gaussian probability distribution : @xmath18 now eq .  ( [ eq : e2 ] ) gives the second moment of this distribution @xmath19 equation  ( [ eq : pdf ] ) is the familiar result that the fluctuations of a free quantum field are gaussian .",
    "as for other quantum field fluctuations , vacuum electric field fluctuations are strongly anticorrelated .",
    "this means that a fluctuation on a time scale @xmath4 is likely to be followed by a fluctuation of the opposite sign .",
    "this anticorrelation prevents brownian motion of a charged particle in the vacuum  @xcite , as is required by energy conservation .",
    "however , a time dependent background can upset the anticorrelations , and allow the particle to gain average energy  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that energy conservation is only required on longer time scales , and quantum fluctuations can temporarily violate energy conservation on scales consistent with the energy - time uncertainty principle .",
    "here we will be examining a situation where these temporary violations of energy conservation can lead to observable effects .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : section  [ sec : qm ] will review a perturbative treatment of quantum scattering in one space dimension , where the incident particle energy exceeds the height of the potential barrier .",
    "the one loop qed correction to this scattering will be summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : rad ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eflucts ] , we will present an order of magnitude rederivation of this one loop correction based upon vacuum electric field fluctuations , and argue that this provides a simple physical picture for the origin of the qed correction . in sect .",
    "[ sec : tunnel ] , we repeat this discussion of one loop corrections for the case of quantum tunneling . in sect .  [",

    "the lowest order nonrelativistic scattering reviewed in the previous subsection corresponds to fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] .",
    "the one loop correction to this process of interest here is the vertex correction , described by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] .",
    "the computation of the vertex correction is discussed in many references , such as ref .",

    "[ fig : vertex ] , contains an infrared divergence .",
    "the solution to this problem is well known , and first given by bloch and nordsieck  @xcite .",
    "it involves the realization that in any scattering process , there is a nonzero probability of emission of soft photons by bremsstrahlung , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : brem ] . in any experiment , there is a threshold of photon energy below which the soft photons can not be detected , so the bremsstrahlung process becomes indistinguishable from the scattering process .",

    "the net effect of the radiative correction to the quantum scattering by the potential @xmath21 is to decrease the reflection probability and hence increase the transmission probability .",
    "the decrease in reflection probability can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the speed of the electron before and after scattering .",
    "note that the magnitude of this decrease grows quadratically with increasing electron speed .",
    "although the logarithmic factor is formally divergent as @xmath57 , it grows very slowly and can never be very large in a realistic experiment .",
    "for example , in an experiment performed at finite temperature @xmath58 , we need @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is boltzmann s constant , in order that the bremsstrahlung photons can be distinguished from the thermal photons .",
    "if @xmath27 is the electron mass , and @xmath61 , then @xmath62 and is only slightly larger ( @xmath63 ) at @xmath64 . here",
    "we set @xmath65 in both cases .",

    "( [ eq : delr ] ) using a simple physical picture invoking vacuum fluctuations of the electric field . if @xmath67 , then the speed of the electron as it passes over the barrier is approximately its initial speed , @xmath26 .",
    "if the characteristic width of the barrier is @xmath20 , then the time required to transit over the barrier is @xmath68 .",
    "now we assume that the electron effectively samples the quantized electric field with a sampling function @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that the electron feels a mean electric field of about @xmath70 , and a force of order @xmath71 , which changes the electron s momentum during the transit by @xmath72 although the electrons are quantum particles in wavepacket states , we assume that ehrenfest s theorem allows us to use newtonian mechanics to calculate @xmath73 , which will only be used to find averages or averages of a square , but not the properties of an individual electron .",

    "( [ eq : del - p ] ) can be either positive or negative with equal probability .",
    "thus we need to examine in more detail how a small change in momentum during transit over the barrier changes the reflection probability .",
    "recall that quantum field fluctuations are strongly anticorrelated , so the change in momentum during the transit is likely to be quickly reversed by a fluctuation in the opposite direction soon after the electron has cleared the barrier .",
    "our key assumption will be that the kinematic factor proportional to @xmath74 in eq .",

    "an order of magnitude estimate for the tunneling time will be sufficient .",
    "if @xmath103 , @xmath22 and @xmath114 are all of the same order of magnitude , then one expects that this time will not be dramatically different from the time required for a free particle of energy @xmath115 to travel a distance @xmath20 , which is @xmath116 .",
    "that is , we expect @xmath117 , where the effective speed @xmath118 is of order @xmath26 .",

    "this force does work of order @xmath121 , and causes a momentum change of order @xmath122 , whose signs may be either positive or negative . here",
    "we will use the fact that if the force is in the direction of motion of the electron , it slightly decreases the transit time and hence increases @xmath123 and the work . a force in the backwards direction has the opposite effect .",
    "let @xmath124 and @xmath125 be the effective speed and transit time when the force is in the forward direction , and @xmath126 and @xmath127 be the corresponding quantities for a backward force fluctuation .",
    "then @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( the factor of @xmath130 in the change in @xmath124 comes from taking an average velocity when the change in momentum is given by eq .",

    "similarly , @xmath131 the average change in kinetic energy due to a forward force fluctuations is @xmath132 and that for the backward direction is @xmath133 the averaged change in energy is then @xmath134 the net effect is an average increase in electron energy during the tunneling process , which is approximately equal in magnitude to the decrease in potential given by eq .",
    "( [ delta v ] ) . within the wkb approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wkb ] ) reveals that both correspond to the same increase in tunneling probability .",
    "thus our heuristic derivation based upon vacuum electric field fluctuations agrees with the result of flambaum and zelevinsky  @xcite .",
    "in the previous sections , we have discussed one loop corrections to potential scattering , that is , effects which may be calculated from perturbation theory .",
    "these effects are small compared to the tree level transmission rates , and in our heuristic treatment , are estimated from the mean square of the time averaged electric field , given by eq .",

    "consider the situation discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tunnel ] , where an electron has an incident energy less than the height of the potential barrier .",
    "a sufficiently large electric field fluctuation could temporarily give the electron enough energy to fly over the barrier .",
    "this extra energy is likely to be taken away by a fluctuation of the opposite sign , but this does not matter if the particle is now on the far side of the barrier . assume a temporary increase in electron energy of order @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "we estimate that the electron flies over the barrier at a speed of order @xmath137 and in a time of order @xmath117 .",
    "we may combine these expressions and solve for @xmath17 to find @xmath138 where @xmath139 note that @xmath140 is somewhat larger than the width of the barrier @xmath20 measured as a multiple of the electron compton wavelength , so we expect @xmath141 .",

    "( [ eq : pdf ] ) @xmath146 this integral may be evaluated in terms of the error function , and in the limit of large @xmath140 , the result is @xmath147 we can view this result as a nonperturbative contribution to the transmission probability @xmath58 .",
    "its nonperturbative character is demonstrated by the appearance of @xmath148 in the denominator of an exponential .    as noted above , @xmath149 is the barrier width as a multiple of the electron compton wavelength , so we expect @xmath150 and hence the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonpert ] ) to be very small .",
    "another feature of this result which should be noted is the lack of explicit dependence upon the barrier height , @xmath103 .",

    "the one loop correction increases the transmission probability .",
    "we have argued that the order of magnitude of this increase can be obtain from very simple arguments based upon vacuum fluctuations of the quantized electric field .",
