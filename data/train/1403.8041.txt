    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) was first directly observed by cooling atomic vapors to temperatures in the nk regime @xcite .",
    "these vapors were confined in three - dimensional traps , of which the shape can be altered by changing certain experimental parameters , e.g. the magnetic field . for sufficiently tight confinement in two or one directions ,",
    "the dynamics in these dimensions can be frozen out and the atoms behave as a quasi one - dimensional or two - dimensional gas .",
    "this manipulation opened up the possibility to explore bose - einstein condensates in lower dimensions @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    "these low - dimensional bose - einstein condensates are particulary interesting as their physics is fundamentally different from three - dimensional condensates .",
    "namely , in two dimensions a homogeneous bose gas can only undergo bec at zero temperature and in one dimension bec in a homogeneous bose gas can not take place at all @xcite . in the presence of an external potential the situation drastically changes . in particular , harmonically trapped bosons",
    "can undergo bec at non - zero temperatures in both one and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "for homogeneous two - dimensional bose gases , theoretical studies show that even though the bose - einstein condensate does not exist at non - zero temperatures , there still exists a critical temperature in the system .",
    "below the so - called kosterlitz - thouless temperature the gas is superfluid , and above this temperature the bosons lose their superfluid property @xcite .",
    "this is known as the kosterlitz - thouless transition , and it implies that superfluidity only requires the presence of a quasi - condensate @xcite with phase coherence over a distance much less than the system size .",
    "this quasi - condensate can be roughly interpreted as a system consisting of several patches with each a fixed phase , whereas the phases of these different patches are uncorrelated .",
    "in addition to atomic gases , there are presently also other low - dimensional systems in which bec is observed , such as systems consisting of exciton - polaritons @xcite or photons @xcite .",
    "together with bec of magnons @xcite , these systems form a class of condensates that is different from the atomic bose - einstein condensates .",
    "in particular , the bosonic quasiparticles have a small effective mass resulting in bec at temperatures in the range of 10 - 300 k instead of in the nk regime relevant for the atomic bose - einstein condensates .",
    "furthermore , these condensates are not in true thermal equilibrium , and the steady state is a dynamical balance between particle losses and external pumping .",
    "therefore , the particles have a finite lifetime , which can be characterized by a single dimensionless damping parameter .",
    "for bec of photons this is explicitly shown in ref.@xcite . in this article",
    "we study the effect of this damping parameter on the first - order correlation functions of low - dimensional bose - einstein condensates .",
    "first , we derive a general expression for the first - order correlation function for a homogeneous bose gas in the condensed phase in sec.[sec : phasefluc ] .",
    "hereafter , we use this general expression for the first - order correlation functions to determine the effect of the finite lifetime on the spatial and temporal correlations in sec.[sec : nonequi ] . in sec.[sec : normal ] we focus on bec of photons , taking their interaction with the dye molecules into account , and determine the off - diagonal long - range behaviour of the one - particle density matrix in the bose - einstein condensed phase .",
    "we show that for the relevant parameters used in the experiment the photons form a true condensate .",
    "subsequently , we determine the first - order correlation functions of photons in the normal state , and we end with conclusions and an outlook in sec.[sec : concl ] .",

    "a more accurate approach that takes into account higher - order terms in @xmath29 would not contain these high - momentum contributions .",
    "therefore , the correct expression for the phase fluctuations is given by @xmath30 } e^{i ( { \\bf k } \\cdot ( { \\bf x } - { \\bf x}^{\\prime } ) - \\omega_{m } ( \\tau - \\tau^{\\prime}))}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in certain cases the self - energy is only known for real frequencies .",

    "we take @xmath34 , and the case @xmath35 is treated analogously . in principle",
    "we have to consider both the density and phase fluctuations , in order to calculate the first - order correlation functions .",
    "however , here we consider relatively high condensate fractions for which the density fluctuations are strongly suppressed and the phase flucutations are most important , especially for the description of the long - range order which is of most interest to us here @xcite .",

    "as mentioned before , the real part of the self - energy can effectively be absorped in the chemical potential and therefore we neglect this part .",
    "the imaginary part is zero for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and therefore for small frequencies the imaginary part is linear in @xmath43 . since the result of eq .",
    "is dominated by the contributions for small frequencies , the large frequency behaviour is not visible in the final result .",

    "note that this argument is independent of the number of dimensions , and therefore also in one dimension the @xmath54 dependence of the spatial correlations is negligible .     for the bose - einstein condensate of photons for a condensate fraction @xmath79 .",
    "]      in order to study the temporal correlation function , we define the first - order correlation function @xmath80 as follows @xmath81 with the temporal correlations defined as @xmath82 . similarly to the spatial correlations , we consider the regime in which the phase fluctuations are dominant .",
    "therefore , we can directly calculate @xmath83 by using eqs . and , where we again consider @xmath67 . in fig.[fig :",

    ", @xmath83 increases for increasing @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , we find the same qualitative behaviour in one dimension .",
    "thus as opposed to the spatial correlations , the finite lifetime effects are important for the temporal correlations .",
    "in the previous section we gave a general discussion on finite lifetime effects on correlation functions of bosons in the bose - einstein condensed phase . in this section we will focus on a specific example of such a system , namely bec of photons @xcite . since this system is two - dimensional",
    ", we first investigate whether the photons form a quasi - condensate or a true condensate .      in order to determine whether the photons form a quasi - condensate or a true condensate , we need to calculate the off - diagonal long - range behaviour of the one - particle density matrix , and compare the size of the condensate with the distance over which the one - particle density matrix falls off .",
    "in particular , if the size of the condensate is smaller than the distance over which the one - particle density matrix reduces to say half of the maximum value , we have a true condensate . otherwise , we are in the quasi - condensate regime . furthermore , we consider the regime where the density fluctuations are surpressed and therefore we are at large condensate fractions .",
    "therefore we are allowed to use the thomas - fermi approximation , and we obtain for the number of condensed photons @xmath84 where the thomas - fermi radius @xmath85 is the size of the condensate .",
    "note that the constant energy @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the speed of the photons in the medium , is absorbed in the definition of the chemical potential @xmath5 .",

    ", we can relate the chemical potential to the total number of photons in our system .     of the photons in the normal state for @xmath90 as a function of @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "the blue curve is the result without taking into account the molecules and the red curve corresponds to a molecular density @xmath93 . ]",
    "this then implies @xmath94 furthermore , for the density of condensed photons @xmath37 we take the density in the center of the trap .",

    "furthermore , we use ref.@xcite to obtain relevant numerical values for the parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath6 . in fig.[fig : truecon ] we show a plot of the normalized first - order spatial correlation function @xmath99 as defined in eq . for a condensate fraction of @xmath100 . from this plot",
    "it is clear that the phase correlation function @xmath101 hardly drops over the condensate size , and that the photons form a true condensate .",
    "in principal we should also include the harmonic trap in the calculation for @xmath102 , but we are so far in the true condensate regime that this correction will not influence this conclusion .",
    "apart from the bose - einstein condensed phase , the photons can also be in the normal state .",
    "since in this case not only the small frequency behaviour of the self - energy is important , the details of the system of interest should be included and we need the exact expression for the self - energy .",

    "it turns out that for the densities used in these experiments the effect of the molecules is small . in order to demonstrate the effect of the dye molecules we take @xmath110 . in general high molecular densities can spoil the thermalization of the photons , but this value should be within the regime in which the photons can still thermalize . as can be seen in fig.[fig : nsspatial ] , the normalized spatial correlation function @xmath108 is lowered by the effect of the molecules . in order to make a prediction for the experiment we should incorporate the harmonic potential .",
    "however , the harmonic oscillator length of the trap is roughly @xmath111 and thus sufficiently larger than the distances over which @xmath108 is non - zero .",
    "therefore , we expect that the incorporation of this harmonic potential is a small effect . the normalized first - order temporal correlation @xmath83 consist of an imaginary and a real part , which we show seperately in fig.[fig : nstemp ] . for both parts the amplitude of the oscillations are decreased by the interaction with the molecules .",
    "here , we used correlation functions in terms of creation and annihilation operators . in experiments",
    "one measures the correlation between the electric field at different times and positions , and therefore experimentally only the real part is relevant .",
    "in this paper we investigated finite lifetime effects , characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath54 , on the first - order correlation functions . by taking into account",
    "the phase fluctuations up to all orders , we derived an explicit expression for the first - order correlation functions in the bose - einstein condensed phase for high condensate fractions .",
    "we showed that the value of @xmath54 does not influence the spatial correlations , but it enhances the temporal correlation function .",
    "subsequently , we focussed on bec of photons under the relevant experimental conditions and we showed that the phase of the condensate is coherent over length scales larger than the size of the condensate .",
    "therefore , the photons form a true condensate . finally , we calculated the normalized first - order correlation functions of the photons in the normal state and we showed that the spatial and temporal correlations are both surpressed by the interaction with the dye molecules . for future research",
    "it is interesting to investigate the regime with smaller condensate fractions . here",
    "the density fluctuations are important and they also have to be incorporated in the formalism . for bec of photons",
