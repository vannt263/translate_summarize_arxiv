    "interfaces between different materials are subjects of great current interest due to the possibility of exploiting various ( emerging ) properties of these structures .",
    "one such promising hybrid system is characterized by an interface between an ordinary @xmath0-wave superconductor ( sc ) and a semiconductor ( sm ) with strong spin - orbit coupling.@xcite it has been shown recently@xcite that , by combining these two conventional materials , one can realize in the sm a topological @xmath1-wave superconducting state that hosts exotic majorana zero - energy modes.@xcite the defects carrying these modes obey non - abelian braiding statistics,@xcite and can be utilized for topological quantum computation.@xcite the promise of engineering exotic physics using well - known generic materials has excited the experimental community , and there are significant experimental efforts aimed at finding majorana zero - energy states in sm - sc hybrid structures,@xcite following the nanowire proposal of refs .  .",
    "most of these experiments@xcite pursued the detection of a zero - bias conductance peak associated with the majorana modes through tunneling transport measurements and found the appearance of the peak at a finite magnetic field , as predicted.@xcite however , a serious and persistent problem has been that , in addition to the peak , these experiments reveal a substantial subgap conductance , the origin of which has been mysterious , controversial , and highly problematic from the perspective of a theoretical interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , this soft - gap feature is the main roadblock for majorana - based quantum computing proposals,@xcite which require a hard gap ( i.e. vanishing subgap conductance ) in the low - energy spectrum.@xcite    in this article we develop a theory of the proximity effect in superconductor  semiconductor  normal - metal ( sc - sm - nm ) nanostructures that provides an explanation for the origin of the observed `` soft - gap , '' a feature originally designating the substantial subgap conductance revealed by the transport measurements on nanowire - sc hybrid structures.@xcite we demonstrate that the very presence of a metallic lead coupled to the nanowire ( i.e. , even in the absence of a tunneling current ) modifies the low - energy local density of states ( ldos ) in the sc region of the wire and might generate a smooth subgap background , i.e. , a soft gap . in other words",
    ", the normal metal itself produces an undesirable proximity effect on the sm wire , partially filling the proximity gap induced by the sc .",
    "in addition to transport , this effect could be revealed by , e.g. , a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) measurement on a sc - sm - nm structure . using an effective model , we calculate the ldos and the tunneling conductance in realistic settings and",
    "show that the states responsible for the soft gap are associated with low - lying occupied bands in the nanowire , which hybridize with the nm states and generate the subgap background due to the vastly varying transmission probabilities for different transverse subbands .",
    "indeed , different transverse subbands are characterized by different hybridization couplings across the barrier with the highest ( lowest)-occupied modes being most weakly ( strongly ) coupled to the nm lead .",
    "given that the majorana peak is due to states from the highest - occupied band , its experimental observation requires lowering the confining potential barrier , which , in turn , increases the transmission probability for the lowest - occupied subbands . when this transmission probability becomes of order one ( i.e. strong coupling limit for the given band ) , the hybridization with the metal generates the subgap background .",
    "we note that previous studies@xcite have concluded that one can not exactly reproduce the substantial background subgap density of states seen in the experiments.@xcite the origin of the soft - gap was attributed to some extrinsic mechanisms , i.e. interface disorder.@xcite in this article , we explicitly show the role of multiband occupancy and of band - selective sm - nm coupling in the emergence , even in a clean system , of the soft - gap and argue that this multiband intrinsic model provides a natural explanation of the experimental results .    .",
    "the curves , illustrating the main result of the btk theory , correspond to zero temperature and are normalized by multiplying @xmath2 with the normal - state resistance @xmath3 ( see ref . ) . in the strong - barrier limit",
    "( @xmath4 ) @xmath2 is proportional to the density of states in the superconductor , but the two quantities become completely unrelated in the weak - barrier regime.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    [ ffig1 ]",
    "in this section we provide a qualitative picture of the soft - gap mechanism that summarizes our technical results . for clarity",
    ", we would like to emphasize from the very beginning two key points .",
    "1 ) this is an `` intrinsic '' mechanism that links the emergence of a smooth in - gap background  the soft - gap  to the presence of a metallic lead strongly coupled to the semiconductor nanowire .",
    "in addition , in real structures , there may be `` extrinsic '' contributions generated , for example , by interface disorder and potential impurities.@xcite in an isolated sm - sc system these states generate sharp subgap spectral features that depend on the specific disorder realization .",
    "however , the coupling of the nanowire to a normal - metal lead will broaden these sharp features , leading to a smooth background .",
    "thus , in general , both the intrinsic and the extrinsic mechanisms are expected to contribute to the soft - gap feature .",
    "2 ) the soft gap occurs due to the coupling of the nanowire to a normal - metal lead used to probe the active sm - sc system in a transport measurement .",
    "however , this is not an exclusive transport feature ( e.g. , a property of the differential conductance @xmath2 ) , but also characterizes the equilibrium properties of a nm - sm - sc system ( e.g. , the local density of states ) . in other words , if @xmath2 is characterized by a soft - gap , the ldos ( inside the barrier region ) in the absence of any charge current will also be characterized by a soft - gap .",
    "the features associated with these different manifestations of the soft - gap are in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "the soft - gap phenomenon , as manifested in transport measurements , can be understood within the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) theory,@xcite which describes the crossover from metallic to tunnel junction behavior .",
    "let us consider a typical system currently used in majorana experiments ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "a certain segment of a sm nanowire is proximity - coupled to an @xmath0-wave sc , while the remaining part of the wire is coupled to a nm lead through an ohmic contact .",
    "the superconducting segment , which represents the `` active system , '' is separated from the normal part ( which represents the probe ) by a potential barrier @xmath5 . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath6 .",
    "for a given sm nanowire band ( say @xmath7 ) , the transparency of the potential barrier depends on the strength of the potential , @xmath8 , as well as the characteristic fermi velocity , @xmath9 . more specifically , in the normal state ( i.e. , above some critical temperature ) the transmission coefficient is@xcite @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a band - dependent dimensionless barrier strength .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ ffig1 ] , the contribution of band @xmath7 to the differential conductance @xmath2 depends critically on the barrier strength @xmath12 . in the strong - barrier ( @xmath13 ) , i.e. , low transparency ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "limit the differential conductance is proportional with the sc density of states , i.e. , the density of states characterizing the _ decoupled _ sc segment separated from the probe by an infinite barrier . if there are no in - gap states ( as assumed in the calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ ffig1 ] ) , @xmath2 will be characterized in this limit by a `` hard '' gap . by contrast , for low barriers ( @xmath15 ) , i.e. , high transparencies ( @xmath16 ) , the differential conductance corresponding to values of the bias voltage inside the sc gap ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) becomes finite . as a result , upon lowering the barrier height , the @xmath2 hard gap becomes soft and , eventually , is completely filled in ( see fig .",
    "[ ffig1 ] ) .    based on the above observations ,",
    "one concludes that the soft - gap phenomenon has to be associated with a high transparency barrier .",
    "however , in order to obtain any sharp feature in the tunneling conductance ( such as the expected majorana zero - bias peak ) , the potential barrier should be in the low - transparency limit for the top occupied sm band , i.e. , the band with the lowest @xmath9 value .",
    "this top occupied band is , in fact , responsible for the majorana physics ( hence it is sometimes called the majorana band ) .",
    "consequently , the soft - gap phenomenon observed in the recent majorana experiments is based on a mechanism that has two critical ingredients : ( i ) multiband occupancy and ( ii ) band - selective coupling to the external probe .",
    "the height of the potential barrier is experimentally adjusted to ensure the visibility of the zero - bias peak ( zbp ) .",
    "this corresponds to the top ( majorana ) band being in the weak - coupling ( low - transparency ) limit .",
    "however , the barrier potential can not be too strong because this would lead to a zbp with vanishingly small weight ( i.e. , it leads to the disappearance of the zbp , as we will explicitly show below ) .",
    "consequently , the potential barrier height has to be within a certain optimal window .",
    "these optimal potential values correspond to a highly transparent barrier for the low - energy occupied bands .",
    "this leads to a finite @xmath2 inside the sc gap , i.e. , to the soft - gap phenomenon .",
    "note that single - band models@xcite do not contain the main ingredients identified above and , consequently , can not reproduce the background subgap density of states associated with the soft - gap feature .",
    "next , we turn to the equilibrium manifestation of the soft - gap as revealed by the density of states .",
    "as discussed above , transport measurements provide information on the density of states of the active system _ only _ in the weak tunneling limit ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . however , in a multiband wire this condition might not be satisfied for all occupied bands , since the transparency of the barrier is band dependent . to gain a better understanding of the mixed regime that characterizes systems with both high and low transmission bands",
    ", we also calculate the local density of states , a thermodynamic quantity that can be measured using , for example , stm .",
    "since some of the bands are highly transparent , it is critical to take into account the effect of the normal lead in a non perturbative way .",
    "the coupling of a low density sm to an @xmath0-wave sc and a nm lead generates proximity effects that can be understood within the green s function framework . due to the sm - sc proximity effect",
    ", the sm wire acquires a spectral gap .",
    "this sc proximity effect can be taken into account through a boundary self - energy @xmath20 that is due to the exchange of particles between the two subsystems .",
    "in addition , the coupling to the normal metal leads to a sm - nm proximity effect that accounts for the hybridization of sm and nm states and can be described by an interface self - energy @xmath21 containing both real and imaginary contributions .",
    "thus the density of states in the sm is determined by a combined effect of the sc and the nm .",
    "the effect of the normal lead is particularly important for the density of states below the induced sc gap , where nominally ( i.e. , in an active system _ without _ any lead ) the quasiparticle density of states would be zero . in the presence of the sm - nm coupling , the in - gap density of states acquires a finite correction induced by the nm and , consequently",

    "[ ffig2](a ) .",
    "we focus on the contribution to the local density of states ( ldos ) integrated over the semiconductor volume of a single sm state ( with energy @xmath29 ) that hybridizes with nm and sc states .",

    "panel ( a ) corresponds to a sm ribbon proximity coupled to a mesoscopic sc only , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the only contributions within the bulk sc gap ( @xmath31 ) , i.e. , the two sharp peaks , arise from two bogoliubov quasiparticles with energies @xmath32 corresponding to the proximity - induced sc gap .",
    "note that hybridization with the ( discrete ) sc states pushes some of the spectral weight above @xmath31 .",
    "panel ( b ) corresponds to a sm nanoribbon coupled to a mesoscopic nm ( @xmath33 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "each peak corresponds to a hybrid state that has most of its spectral weight inside the nm and a small tail ( of weight proportional to the peak height ) inside the sm .",
    "panel ( c ) represents a proximity - coupled nm - sm - sc structure ( @xmath22 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "individual peaks correspond to low - energy states characterized by nonzero spectral weight inside all three components of the system .",
    "the soft induced gap emerges as an energy - dependent modulation of the spectral weight in the sm tails with maxima near @xmath32 .",
    "the heterostructure corresponding to panel ( d ) is the same as in ( c ) , but has large nm and sc components with quasi continuum spectra .",
    "the green circles are determined using an effective theory obtained by integrating out the sc and nm degrees of freedom ( see sec .",
    "[ theory ] for details ) .",
    "we conclude that the soft - gap is due to the emergence of hybrid states with energies within the induced sc gap and finite spectral weight inside the sm nanoribbon .",
    "the connection with the transport picture presented above is straightforward .",
    "indeed , for strong - enough sm - nm coupling ( which corresponds to ohmic contact between the sm wire and the nm lead in an experimental hybrid structure ) , hybrid states with subgap energies extend throughout the whole system and participate to transport .",
    "this results in a finite subgap @xmath2 , i.e. , the soft - gap behavior .",
    "we end this section with two important observations .",
    "first , we emphasize that in the experimentally relevant configuration the coupling between the sm states and the metallic lead is controlled by two different parameters : the coupling at the sm - nm interface ( @xmath28 ) and the strength / transparency of the potential barrier ( i.e. , @xmath12 or @xmath34 ) .",
    "the sm - nm coupling has to be strong enough to ensure ohmic contact between the sm nanowire and the metallic lead .",
    "otherwise , the interface will correspond to a tunnel junction and the measured @xmath2 will be proportional to the ldos on the sm side of the sm - nm junction , which is different from the ldos at the end of the superconducting segment of the wire ( the active system ) , i.e. , the quantity that carries information about majorana physics , including the zbp . in other words , if the coupling across the sm - nm interface is weak , the majorana band , consisting of states that are confined within the sc segment of the wire , will be completely decoupled from the lead and will not generate any measurable signature . the other parameter  the strength of the potential barrier  is responsible for the band - selective coupling between the sm states and the probe . in a multiband system , the optimal condition for the observation of the majorana zbp may correspond to a high - transparency barrier for the low - energy occupied bands , which leads to the soft - gap phenomenon .",
    "note that the relative transparencies of these bands depend strongly on the profile of the barrier potential .",
    "in particular , for experimentally relevant wide barriers ( with characteristic widths of the order of @xmath35 nm ) the high- ( low- ) transparency condition for the low - energy ( majorana ) bands is naturally satisfied , while for a narrow square potential barrier the high - transparency condition @xmath36 may not be satisfied in a system with a small number of occupied bands . consequently , multiband calculations based on a narrow square potential ( e.g. , ref . ) may not capture the soft - gap phenomenology .",
    "our second comment concerns the role of extrinsic effects , in particular that of interface disorder.@xcite the presence of disorder leads to the proliferation of low - energy subgap states .",
    "if the disorder is characterized by a short characteristic length scale , it strongly affects the low - energy bands with @xmath37 comparable with this characteristic length .",
    "consequently , the ( isolated ) active system will have a nonvanishing subgap density of states characterized by discrete spectral features . upon turning on the coupling to the probe",
    ", these features evolve into a smooth background .",
    "we note that , at finite temperature , thermal effects will contribute to an additional broadening of the spectral features ( e.g. , of the order @xmath38 for the differential conductance ) . in general , both the extrinsic effect and the intrinsic mechanism described in this work are expected to contribute to the soft - gap phenomenon with relative contributions that depend on the details of the system ( e.g. , quality of the wire and of the sm - sc interface , barrier potential profile , barrier height , etc . ) . as demonstrated by this study , eliminating the extrinsic contributions ( i.e. , engineering clean structures ) does not guarantee the absence of the soft - gap feature .",
    "also , while increasing the gate potential can result in a hard gap , this also suppresses the weight of the majorana - induced zbp , which may become unobservable . as we will discuss in more detail in sec .",
    "[ results ] , the practical solution for obtaining a hard gap _ and _ an observable zbp involves engineering clean structures plus low occupancy and narrow potential barriers .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the nm - sm - sc heterostructure has the generic form@xcite @xmath39 where the terms on the right - hand side represent the contributions from the sm wire , gate potential , bulk sc , nm contact , sm - sc coupling , and sm - nm coupling , respectively .",

    "to identify its origin , it is instructive to calculate the local density of states integrated over the relevant segments of the wire .",
    "specifically , we divide the nanowire into three regions : ( 1 ) the segment of the nanowire covered by the normal lead , ( 2 ) the portion covered by the superconductor , and ( 3 ) the uncovered portion of the nanowire where the confining gate potential is applied .",

    "[ ffig3](c ) , the density of states in the wire consists of a superposition of smooth contributions given either by delocalized states that span the whole length of the nanowire or by states that are confined inside the normal region and sharp peaks emerging from the states confined inside the superconducting segment . note that the states responsible for the sharp features correspond to the topmost occupied band ( the majorana band ) , which are confined inside the sc segment and , consequently , hybridize very weakly with the normal lead .      ) calculated using the double - chain model .",
    "the sharp features represent the conductance of a system with a single occupied band ( @xmath160 ) at zero temperature , @xmath161 ( filled black lines ) .",

    "the majorana peak is strongly suppressed at finite temperature ( here @xmath162 mk ) , but the background is practically independent of @xmath165 . in all these calculations the zeeman field is @xmath166 mev.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    [ ffig5 ]    as we have argued above , the soft - gap phenomenon is due to the band - selective coupling between the sm states and the metallic lead and can be understood as a band - dependent combination of metallic and tunnel junction behavior . the soft - gap behavior manifests itself in transport ( as a substantial subgap contribution to the differential conductance ) , as well as in the local density of states . in other words ,",
    "the critical ingredient is the presence of a metallic lead coupled to the nanowire and not the existence of an actual , nonzero charge current in the system . to firmly establish these points ,",
    "we calculate both @xmath2 and the ldos using the double - chain model for two different cases : ( a ) single - band occupancy ( the chemical potential @xmath167 is positioned near the bottom of the lowest energy band ) and ( b ) two - band occupancy ( @xmath167 near the bottom of the second band ) .",

    "( 2 ) the soft gap observed in the tunneling conductance , @xmath2 , and in the ldos integrated over the barrier region , @xmath163 , are two manifestations of the same phenomenon , i.e. , the result of the strong coupling to the normal lead .",
    "( 3 ) the ( intrinsic ) soft - gap can be clearly eliminated by either realizing the single - band occupancy limit , or by completely eliminating the metallic lead ( i.e. , using a probe other than transport to observe the majorana bound states ) . a third possibility involving reduced occupancy in combination with an optimized barrier potential",

    "the curves ( shifted for clarity ) correspond to zeeman fields from 0 ( bottom ) to 0.8 mev ( top ) .",
    "a majorana peak emerges above a certain critical field and splits at high zeeman fields .",
    "note the close correspondence between the two types of calculations which involve systems described by different models and having different parameters.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    [ ffig6 ]    we now consider the dependence of the soft - gap feature on the applied magnetic field and the potential barrier . to understand the experimental measurements involving tunneling spectroscopy , it is instructive to compare the magnetic field dependence of the ldos in region ( 3 ) ( the barrier region ) and the field dependence of the differential conductance .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ffig6 ] . in both cases",
    "one can notice a substantial subgap background and the emergence of a zero - bias peak ( zbp ) above a certain critical value of the magnetic field .",
    "this peak is due to a majorana mode localized at the left end of region ( 2 ) and leaking out into the barrier region .",
    "the splitting of the zbp at large values of the zeeman field ( see fig .  [ ffig6 ] ) is due to the overlap of the wave functions corresponding to the majorana bound states localized at the opposite ends of the superconducting segment of the wire.@xcite one can notice the close similarity between the qualitative features characterizing the two quantities .",
    "( right ) on the barrier height @xmath172 .",
    "note that increasing the barrier height reduces the amplitude of the zero - bias peak as the majorana bound state penetrates less inside the barrier region and decouples from the lead .",
    "in addition , varying the barrier potential changes the energy of the delocalized states that extend throughout the wire and , as a result , modifies the profile of the soft - gap .",
    "the finite - energy sharp features present near the induced sc gap edge ( @xmath173 mev , left panel ) are due to the states from the second highest occupied band that become confined inside the superconducting region . on the other hand ,",
    "the smooth low - energy maximum corresponding to @xmath174 mev is generated by a state from the second highest occupied band that crosses the chemical potential and is confined inside the normal segment of the wire .",
    "the inter - band spacings are @xmath175 mev ( left ) and @xmath134 mev ( right ) and the zeeman field is @xmath166 mev . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ ffig7 ]    the effective coupling between the normal - metal lead and the active system can , in principle , be controlled through the gate - tunable potential barrier.@xcite the dependence of @xmath163 and @xmath2 on the height of the barrier potential for a gaussian potential with @xmath74 nm is shown in fig .",
    "[ ffig7 ] .",
    "one can notice that the barrier affects the subgap states and the majorana zero - energy state differently .",
    "indeed , let us consider the high barrier limit ( i.e. , barrier height larger than the chemical potential in the sm nanowire ) and study the evolution of the subgap density of states .",
    "upon a decrease of the barrier height , the soft - gap feature is emerging first , and then the zero - energy peak becomes visible .",
    "this fact confirms that the soft - gap originates from the low - lying subbands that can more easily penetrate through the barrier and thus become strongly hybridized with the metallic lead .",
    "by contrast , the majorana zero - energy peak originates from the weakly coupled topmost band .",
    "we also find that the change of the potential barrier modifies the energies of the extended states that contribute to the soft - gap and , consequently , modifies its profile . we conclude that the structures used in current tunneling experiments@xcite are not optimally designed for suppressing the soft - gap feature ( e.g. by increasing the barrier potential height ) while maintaining the visibility of the majorana zero - bias peak .",
    "we identify the main problem as the broad barrier profile that characterizes these structures .",
    "mev , @xmath1692 @xmath55 m , @xmath1760.4 mev and different potential barriers ( see inset ) .",
    "the two barriers have the same transparency for the majorana band , but significantly different transparencies for the low - energy occupied band .",
    "this results in the two majorana zbps having the same weight and the soft - gap being strongly suppressed in the system with a narrow barrier.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    [ ffig8 ]    finally , we address a question of significant practical importance : if merely increasing the height of the potential barrier is likely to generate the disappearance of the zbp before producing a hard gap , what should be done to ensure the coexistence of both the zbp and the hard gap ?",
    "the solution involves two basic requirements : i ) reducing the occupancy of the nanowire and ii ) generating a very narrow barrier .",
    "of course , this assumes that all extrinsic effects are already eliminated by carefully engineering clean hybrid structures .",
    "the first requirement is less restrictive than the single - band occupancy condition ( if this can be realized , the soft - gap feature is automatically eliminated ) . the rationale behind both the first and the second requirement is to minimize the ratio between the transparencies corresponding to the lowest - energy band and the topmost band .",
    "these could still be significantly different , but this difference should not be more than about an order of magnitude .",
    "for example , a transparency for the majorana band @xmath177 ( which corresponds to @xmath178 for a @xmath179-function - type barrier ) ensures the visibility of the majorana zbp .",
    "if the lowest - energy band has a transparency @xmath180 ( which corresponds to @xmath181 ) , it will still be in the weak - coupling limit and will generate an extremely weak in - gap background .",
    "satisfying these conditions using a broad barrier may be extremely difficult ( it requires very small inter - band gaps , i.e. , a thick wire with just a couple of occupied bands ) .",
    "on the other hand , using a narrow barrier facilitates the realization of these conditions .",
    "in fact , we believe that the simplifying assumption of a barrier that can be modeled by a single - site/@xmath179-function - like potential has prevented the observation of soft - gap features in previous multiband model calculations.@xcite to illustrate the major difference between the effect of broad and narrow barriers , we calculate the differential conductance for two systems having the same parameters , except for the barrier potentials , which have different profiles , as shown in the insets of fig .",
    "[ ffig8 ] .",
    "the heights of the two barriers were adjusted so that the two systems have the same transparency for the majorana band .",
    "this translates into the two majorana zbps having the same weight ( note that the zbp corresponding to the wide barrier sits on top of the smooth subgap background generated by states from the lowest - energy band ) .",
    "the strong suppression of the soft - gap feature in the system with a narrow barrier is due to the fact that the transparency of the low - energy band ( with a fermi energy of about @xmath134 mev ) is much smaller than the transparency of the same band in the wide barrier system .",
    "this can be easily understood by comparing the fermi energy with the heights of the two barriers .",
    "we have developed a comprehensive theory for the nm - sm - sc hybrid heterostructures using realistic models for the semiconductor nanowire , the normal - metal lead , and the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "we have identified a distinct physical mechanism , namely an `` inverse proximity '' effect by the normal metal on the semiconductor nanowire at the semiconductor - metal interface , which by itself generically leads to soft - gap features in the multiband wire system by virtue of producing substantial subgap conductance .",
    "this inverse proximity effect is , in principle , always present , and has a strength that depends on the details of the tunnel barrier at the semiconductor  normal - metal junction and on the number of conducting subbands active in the nanowire . our model , without including any external effects such as interface disorder ,",
    "captures the phenomenology observed in recent majorana experiments@xcite and allows one to explain the so - called soft - gap issue .",
    "we show that the substantial subgap conductance in these experiments originates from the multiple subbands in the nanowire having vastly different transmission probabilities through the barrier defined by the gate .",
    "we emphasize that this is an intrinsic contribution to the soft - gap issue ; the extrinsic effects such as interface disorder will further exacerbate this problem .",
    "thus our results have important implications for the ongoing majorana experiments where the soft - gap issue is the main roadblock to braiding and performing quantum computation with majorana modes .",
    "we show that , to interpret the experimental results,@xcite one has to consider different coupling of the occupied subbands in the nanowire to the normal - metal lead . by calculating local density of states and differential tunneling conductance ,",
    "we show that the `` majorana band '' ( i.e. , highest subband ) has generically the weakest coupling to the lead .",
    "therefore , one has to lower the barrier in order to increase signal - to - noise ratio which , in turn , increases the normal - metal coupling for the lowest occupied subbands leading to a significant hybridization of these states with the lead ( i.e. , the soft - gap problem ) . to reduce the subgap background , we suggest decreasing the nm - nanowire coupling and the length of the normal nanowire segment , realizing narrow barriers , or using alternative , less invasive detection schemes involving an stm@xcite or quantum dots,@xcite where the transmission between normal lead and nanowire can be controlled by the intradot coulomb energy rather than the tunneling barrier .        50ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] ",
