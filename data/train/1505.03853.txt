    "we first introduce a three - strategy version of the spatial inspection game , where in addition to criminals @xmath1 and punishers @xmath2 , also ordinary people @xmath3 compete for space on a @xmath4 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we use the latter as the simplest network to account for the fact that the interaction range among individuals in human societies is limited . the payoff matrix +    [ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     contains the same three main parameters as the three - strategy payoff matrix , with the key difference being that punishers @xmath5 and @xmath6 are willing to bear only @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the full punishment cost @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "naturally , they also receive a proportionally smaller reward @xmath10 .",
    "punishers @xmath11 correspond to punishers @xmath2 in the three - strategy model in terms of their commitment to sanctioning criminals , but we introduce a different notation for convenience .    both the uniform three - strategy and the heterogeneous five - strategy spatial inspection game are studied by means of monte carlo simulations , as described in the methods section .",
    "we begin by presenting the complete @xmath12 phase diagram at a representative value of the punishment cost @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "it can be observed that criminals dominate if the reward for their punishment @xmath10 is small .",
    "if the reward exceeds a certain value at a fixed temptation / loss @xmath13 , then the punishers become viable . at moderate @xmath13 values , however , their presence is also accompanied by the emergence of ordinary players .",
    "the stability of the @xmath14 phase is due to cyclic dominance between the three competing strategies @xcite . in particular , within the @xmath14 region ordinary people outperform the punishers , the punishers defeat the criminals , while the criminals beat ordinary people , thus closing the @xmath15 loop of dominance .",
    "conversely , for larger values of @xmath13 , in particular if @xmath16 , the pure @xmath1 phase becomes the two - strategy @xmath17 phase via a second - order continuous phase transition as @xmath10 increases . moreover , at sufficiently large values of the reward @xmath10 , the three - strategy @xmath14 phase and the two - strategy @xmath17 phase are separated by a second - order continuous phase transition .    for a more quantitative view , we present in fig .",
    "[ cross ] characteristic cross - sections of the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "these cross - sections confirm that criminals can dominate in the high temptation / loss region or in the low reward region .",
    "moreover , it can be observed that larger rewards are beneficial for the punishers , but only up to a certain point . if @xmath10 increases beyond a critical point",
    "ordinary people emerge , and as second - order free - riders they flourish on the expense of those that punish criminal behavior .",
    "we emphasize that , interestingly , the payoffs of ordinary people are independent of @xmath10 , yet still their fraction increases as @xmath10 increases .",
    "this counterintuitive result is due to cyclic dominance , where feeding the prey , in this case the punishers who do get larger payoffs for larger @xmath10 values , directly benefits the predator , which in this case are the ordinary people @xcite .",
    "we can thus conclude that the real obstacle in the fight against criminal behavior is the possibility of ordinary people to free - ride on the efforts of punishers .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached before for the evolution of cooperation in the public goods game with punishers , where the free - riding problem of defectors is simply deferred to the second - order free - riding problem of cooperators @xcite .    as a natural response of punishers to the harmful exploitation of ordinary people",
    ", we next consider the five - strategy spatial inspection game with heterogeneous punishment .",
    "in particular , strategies @xmath5 and @xmath6 try to eschew the exploitation by reducing the amount they contribute for sanctioning to @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the full cost , respectively .",
    "however , their reward is proportionally smaller as well ( see the extended payoff matrix in section 2 for details ) . due to the large number of competing strategies and the resulting multitude of possible subsystem solutions we focus on the most important parameter region where ordinary players survive in the uniform , three - strategy , model .",
    "accordingly , we explore a representative cross section when the reward is high enough for punishing strategies to survive , and we explore how the system responds to the diversity of punishment .",
    "results presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ opext ] confirm the effectiveness of resorting to heterogeneous punishment in that second - order free - riders are able to survive only in a significantly narrower interval of the temptation / loss @xmath13 if compared to the uniform punishment model .",
    "furthermore , results presented in the right panel of fig .  [ opext ] also give credence to the expectation that the reduced viability of ordinary people will promote the evolution of punishers . more precisely , we find that the uniform punishment strategy is significantly less effective than heterogeneous punishment for almost the entire range of the temptation / loos @xmath13 , except for a narrow interval in the @xmath16 region . as we will show in fig .",
    "[ cext ] , this fact has important consequences for the mitigation of criminal behavior in the population .",
    "another peculiarity that can be observed in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ opext ] is the zig - zag outlay of the aggregate fraction of all punishers in the five - strategy model . yet",
    "this can be understood thoroughly simply by looking at the fraction of punishers @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath11 individually .",
    "the mentioned panel reveals clearly that low values of @xmath13 are able to sustain only those punishers who are willing to invest the lowest cost towards sanctioning criminals .",
    "the rank of the most viable punishers subsequently increases from @xmath5 over @xmath6 to @xmath11 as we increase @xmath13 , and the solution of the five - strategy model thus eventually becomes identical to the the solution of the three - strategy model .",
    "remarkably , we can observe six consecutive phase transitions [ @xmath18 as we increase a single parameter , @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the reported increment of the punisher rank with increasing the temptation / loss @xmath13 resonates with the outcome of a recent human experiment @xcite , where , in the realm of a social dilemma , it was shown that if cooperation is likely one should punish mildly .",
    "we continue with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ cext ] , where we compare the effectiveness of uniform and heterogeneous punishment to deter criminal behavior . to a degree",
    "unexpected , it can be observed that the possibility to resort to different levels of punishment does not necessarily work better than uniform punishment in reducing crime . on the contrary ,",
    "the fraction of @xmath1 players is generally higher over a large interval of @xmath13 values when the heterogeneous punishment model is used .",
    "more precisely , the fraction of criminals is lower only in the low temptation / loss region where @xmath5 punishers can adjust to this favorable condition .",
    "this observation is related to the failure of heterogeneous punishment to eliminate second - order free - riding more effectively than uniform punishment , and it indicates that sophisticatedly adjusted punishers may win a battle against ordinary people , but loose the main war against the actual enemy , the criminals .",
    "while punishers can lower the amount they invest towards sanctioning criminals , such a reduced effort also yields smaller rewards .",
    "interestingly , the positive side of lower costs can be utilized only if the heterogeneity of punishers is maintained .",
    "the said effect becomes visible if we mark the borders of different phases on the curve of criminals , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "as it is illustrated , the fraction of criminals can be a decaying function even if we increase the temptation / loss @xmath13 , but only as long as different types of punishers exist and compete against the criminals .",
    "as soon as evolution favors a single punisher type , an effective response to an increase of the value of @xmath13 becomes absent .",
    "lastly , we note that the conclusions attained with the results presented in figs .  [ opext ] and [ cext ] remain generally valid also for all high temptation values .    to obtain a better understanding of the origin of the zig - zag outlay of criminals depicted in fig .",
    "[ cext ] , we monitor the time evolution of the distribution of strategies in the population for three different combinations of payoff parameters , as shown in fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] .",
    "we emphasize that the main mechanism responsible for the formation of different stationary states is due to the different motion of interfaces that separate the possible solutions of the system .",
    "accordingly , we follow the evolution of interfaces starting from a prepared initial state , but for clarity only two types of punishers are present because this minimal model is sufficient to capture the essence of the emerging effect .",
    "the extrapolation to the full five - strategy model , however , is straightforward . for comparison",
    ", we use an identical prepared initial state , as shown in the leftmost panel , for three representative values of @xmath13 . as in previous figures ,",
    "red color depicts @xmath1 players while light and dark blue depict the @xmath5 and @xmath6 punishers , respectively . before discussing each specific case , we note that , individually , @xmath5 always beats @xmath6 due to the lower cost of inspection",
    ". when the temptation / loss is low , as shown in panels ( a)-(d ) , @xmath6 can beat @xmath1 very efficiently , while @xmath5 is unable to do the same but simply coexists with the criminals .",
    "the superiority of @xmath5 over @xmath6 , however , will result in a shrinking area of the @xmath6 domain , as shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "ultimately , this fact leads to the extinction of strategy @xmath6 , despite the fact that it is more successful in deterring criminals than strategy @xmath5 .",
    "as soon as @xmath6 die out , as shown in panel ( c ) , criminals can exploit the milder punishment from strategy @xmath5 and spread towards the stationary state , as shown in panel ( d ) .",
    "a seemingly surprising and counterintuitive result is that criminals , who can coexist with @xmath5 players but are defeated by @xmath6 players , are able to survive while their `` predators '' ( @xmath6 ) go extinct .",
    "but in fact , the evolution depicted in the panels ( a)-(d ) simply illustrates the actual consequence of second - order free - riding .",
    "namely , @xmath5 players exploit the more altruistic @xmath6 players by contributing less to sanctioning criminals . in the absence of @xmath5 players , however , the common enemy ( @xmath1 ) can spread relatively free and reach a significantly high level ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath6 players are less successful in deterring @xmath1 players , the outcome is completely the opposite , as shown in panels ( e)-(h ) of fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] . since the temptation / loss @xmath20",
    ", @xmath1 are able to coexist with @xmath6 .",
    "the coexistence of @xmath1 and @xmath5 strategies is also still possible , and at the same time @xmath5 continue to invade the pure @xmath6 phase [ the invasion ends in panel ( f ) ] .",
    "however , @xmath5 become ineffective against the @xmath21 alliance .",
    "indeed , this two - strategy alliance is so powerful that it beats the other @xmath22 alliance completely .",
    "the competition between the two alliances starts in panel ( g ) , and it terminates with the total victory of the @xmath21 alliance in panel ( h ) .",
    "the conclusion is similar as in the preceding case .",
    "namely , when the evolution selects only one type of punishers , then criminals have a reasonable chance to survive .",
    "note that the fraction of criminals in the stationary state is again relatively high , @xmath23 , despite of substantial punishment .",
    "the most favorable outcome can be obtained at an intermediate temptation / loss value , as shown in panels ( i)-(l ) of fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] .",
    "the @xmath24 value is still high enough to maintain the coexistence of the @xmath21 alliance , but it lessens its evolutionary advantage in that the @xmath22 alliance is able to survive .",
    "the stationary state thus contains three strategies , whereby a relatively small portion of the population , @xmath25 , is occupied by criminals .",
    "we thus conclude that , in the long - run , if different punisher strategies survive in the stationary state , heterogeneous punishment may be utilized successfully to mitigate crime better than uniform punishment .",
    "note that @xmath26 is a decreasing function of @xmath13 in the three - strategy phase in fig .",
    "[ cext ] , while it always increasing when homogeneous punishment is applied ( in @xmath22 , @xmath21 , or in the @xmath27 phases ) .",
    "this is because heterogeneous punishment enables the validation of the most effective approach against crime : sometimes moderate efforts , yielding milder fines , serve the interest of whole population better than severe punishment . even more importantly , the simultaneous presence of different types of punishers enables a synergy among them in that one strategy ( in our case @xmath6 ) can lower the payoff of criminals significantly while the other strategy ( @xmath5 ) can still enjoy a more competitive payoff due to a smaller cost .",
    "this multi - point effect is conceptually similar to when the duty of punishment is shared stochastically among cooperative players @xcite . of course",
    ", as we have already emphasized , these conclusions remain valid and can be extrapolated to a larger number of different punisher strategies .",
    "we have studied the effectiveness of punishment in abating criminal behavior in the spatial inspection game with three and five competing strategies , entailing criminals , ordinary people and punishers . in the five - strategy game , we have introduced three different types of punishers , depending on the amount they are willing to contribute towards sanctioning criminals .",
    "we have shown that cyclic dominance plays an important role in that it maintains the survivability of seemingly subordinate strategies through indirect support . for example , increasing the reward for punishing criminals might promote second - order free - riding of ordinary people , despite of the fact that it should in fact support the punishers .",
    "this is due to cyclic dominance , where directly promoting the prey , in this case the punishers , benefits the predator , which in this case are the ordinary people .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the actual obstacle in the fight against criminal behavior is the possibility of ordinary people to free - ride on the efforts of punishers , which is also the main culprit behind the establishment of cyclic dominance .",
    "in general , sanctioning criminal behavior is thus a double - edged sword .",
    "the obvious benefit is that the evolution of crime is contained and is unable to dominate in the population .",
    "the pitfall is that , in conjunction with ordinary people , punishment creates conditions that support cyclic dominance , which prevents the complete abolishment of crime even if the sanctions are severe and effective .",
    "in addition to these observations , we have shown that the possibility of heterogeneous punishment yields a highly ambiguous measure against criminal behavior . at specific parameter values",
    "it can happen that milder punishers play the role of second - order free riders , which ultimately prevents to eliminate crime completely [ see panels ( a)-(d ) in fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] ] .",
    "evidently , the reverse process is also possible in structured populations where the more altruistic punishers can separate from second - order free riders and win the indirect territorial battle @xcite .",
    "but in the realm of the studied inspection game , we have also observed that the diversity of punishers can yield a more favorable social outcome even as the temptation to do crime is growing . in the latter case , the simultaneous presence of different punishers provides an advantageous coexistence : some punishers ensure a higher fine to criminal players while other punishers can benefit from a lower cost due to a less intensive engagement .",
    "importantly , neither of these two options is effective on its own right , but together they improve the effectiveness of combating crime .",
    "notably , the emergence of cyclic dominance due to strategic complexity has been reported before , for example in public goods games with volunteering @xcite , peer punishment @xcite , pool punishment @xcite and reward @xcite , but also in pairwise social dilemmas with coevolution @xcite .",
    "other counterintuitive phenomena that are due to cyclic dominance @xcite include the survival of the weakest @xcite , the emergence of labyrinthine clustering @xcite , and the segregation along interfaces that have internal structure @xcite , to name but a few examples .",
    "cyclical interactions are thus in many ways the culmination of evolutionary complexity @xcite , and we here show that they likely play a prominent role in deterring crime as well . however , while the beneficial role of cyclic dominance for maintaining biodiversity is undeniable , one has to concur that it is a rather unsatisfactory outcome in terms of fighting criminal behavior . that is the sort of diversity in behavior that human societies could happily do without , yet it seems that this is precisely the trap the current system has fallen into .",
    "indeed , data from the federal bureau of investigation ( see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) indicate that crime , regardless of type and severity , is remarkably recurrent .",
    "although positive and negative trends may be inferred , crime events between 1960 and 2010 fluctuate across time and space , and there is no evidence to support that crime rates are permanently decreasing .",
    "the search for more effective crime mitigation strategies is thus in order , in particularly for such where the permanent elimination of crime is not an a priori impossibility .",
    "for both the 3-strategy and the 5-strategy spatial inspection game the monte carlo simulation procedure is the same . initially all competing strategies are distributed uniformly at random on the square lattice .",
    "we note , however , that the reported final stationary states are largely independent of the initial fractions of strategies .",
    "subsequently , in agreement with the random sequential update protocol , a randomly selected player @xmath28 acquires its payoff @xmath29 by playing the game pairwise with all its four neighbors .",
    "next , player @xmath28 randomly chooses one neighbor @xmath30 , who then also acquires its payoff @xmath31 in the same way as previously player @xmath28 .",
    "once both players acquire their payoffs , player @xmath28 adopts the strategy @xmath32 from player @xmath30 with a probability determined by the fermi function @xmath33},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 quantifies the uncertainty related to the strategy adoption process @xcite . in agreement with previous works",
    ", the selected value ensures that strategies of better - performing players are readily adopted by their neighbors , although adopting the strategy of a player that performs worse is also possible @xcite .",
    "this accounts for imperfect information and errors in the evaluation of the opponent .",
    "each full monte carlo step ( mcs ) consists of @xmath35 elementary steps as described above , which are repeated consecutively , thus giving a chance to every player to change its strategy once on average .",
    "we typically use lattices with @xmath36 players , although close to the phase transition points up to @xmath37 players had to be used in this case to avoid accidental extinctions , and thus to arrive at results that are valid in the large - size limit .",
    "the fractions of competing strategies @xmath38 are determined in the stationary state after a sufficiently long relaxation time lasting up to @xmath39 mcs .",
    "in general , the stationary state is reached when the average of the strategy fractions becomes time - independent .",
    "moreover , to account for the differences in initial conditions and to further improve accuracy , the final results are averaged over up to @xmath40 independent runs for each set of parameter values .",

    "<S> no less than six consecutive phase transitions occur in dependence on solely the temptation to succumb to criminal behavior , leading the population from ordinary people - dominated across punisher - dominated to crime - dominated phases , yet always failing to abolish crime completely .    in @xmath0 wilson and kelling </S>",
    "<S> @xcite introduced the `` broken windows theory '' , explaining how seemingly unimportant and harmless signals of urban disorder may over time elicit antisocial behavior and serious crime . </S>",
    "<S> the central premise of the theory is simple yet powerful , and it is reminiscent of preferential attachment or the matthew effect @xcite with a negative connotation . </S>",
    "<S> just like the more connected nodes attract more new links during network growth @xcite , so does an unattended broken window invite bypassers to behave mischievously or even disorderly . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a graffiti might point to an unkept environment , signaling that more egregious damage will likely be tolerated as well . </S>",
    "<S> one broken window is thus likely to become many broken windows , and the inception of urban decay and criminal behavior is in place .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of this widely adopted criminological theory invites mathematicians and physicists to adopt a complex systems approach @xcite to study criminal behavior @xcite , in particular since the collective behavior of the system in this case can hardly be inferred from the relatively simple individual actions . </S>",
    "<S> emergent phenomena such as pattern formation including percolation @xcite and phase transitions are commonly associated with complex social and biological systems @xcite , and in this realm the mitigation of crime is certainly no exception . </S>",
    "<S> recent research highlights that crime is far from being uniformly distributed across space and time @xcite , and this is confirmed also by the dynamic nucleation and dissipation of crime hotspots @xcite and the emergence of complex criminal networks @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of crime can also be treated as a social dilemma @xcite , in as far that social order is the common good that is threatened by criminal activity , with competition arising between criminals and those trying to prevent crime . </S>",
    "<S> an adversarial evolutionary game with four competing strategies has recently been proposed @xcite , where paladins are model citizens that do not commit crimes and collaborate with authorities , while villains , at the other extreme of the spectrum , commit crimes and do not report them . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate figures are informants who report on other offenders while still committing crimes , and apathetics who neither commit crimes nor report to authorities . </S>",
    "<S> apathetics are similar to second - order free - riders in the context of the public goods game with punishment @xcite , in that they cooperate at first order by not committing crimes , but defect at second order by not punishing offenders . </S>",
    "<S> simulations have revealed that in the realm of the adversarial game informants are key to the emergence of a crime - free society , and this has subsequently been confirmed also with human experiments @xcite .    in general , the mitigation of crime can be framed as an evolutionary game with punishment , although recent research has raised doubts on the use of sanctions as a means to promote prosocial behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rewards for not doing and reporting crime are a viable alternative , and in this case the `` stick versus carrot '' dilemma becomes an important consideration @xcite . in the context of rehabilitating criminals , the question is also how much punishment for the crime and how much reward for eschewing wrongdoing in the future is in order for optimal results , as well as whether these efforts should be the responsibility of individuals or institutions @xcite under the assumption of a limited budget @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is at this intersection of statistical physics of complex system and evolutionary games that we aim to contribute in the present paper by considering a three - strategy spatial inspection game with uniform punishment as well as a five - strategy spatial inspection game with heterogeneous punishment . </S>",
    "<S> the inspection game is a recognized model in the sociological literature for the dynamics of crime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the game addresses the question of why anybody would be willing to invest into costly punishment of criminals , given that individuals are tempted to benefit from the punishing activities of others without actively contributing to them . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as ordinary people are introduced who neither commit crimes nor contribute to their mitigation , one is thus faced with the second - order free - rider problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show in what follows , this may introduce cyclic dominance that enables the coexistence of all three competing strategies in the uniform punishment model . </S>",

    "<S> the diversity of punishment allows the formation of different alliances between competing strategies , which gives rise to a sophisticated range of solutions in dependence on the payoffs .    in the next section we first present the details of the considered 3-strategy and 5-strategy spatial inspection game , and then demonstrate how systematic monte carlo simulations reveal the benefits and pitfalls of punishing criminal behavior . </S>",
