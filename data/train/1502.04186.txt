    "device - to - device ( d2d ) communication refers to the situation where two user equipments bypass the cellular and core network and establish a direct local communication link .",
    "d2d communication has been introduced as one of the highlights of 3gpp release 12  @xcite .",
    "it offers several advantages , e.g. , higher transmission rates due to proximity , reduced battery consumption at the mobile handsets , reuse and hop gain , etc .  @xcite . along with benefits ,",
    "d2d support brings also new challenges because the cellular network needs to cope with new interference situations , e.g. , cross - tier interference between cellular and d2d users  @xcite .",
    "in order to alleviate the interference problems introduced by d2d , a great deal of mode selection and resource allocation algorithms have been proposed , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , almost all existing algorithms are applicable to single - operator networks .",
    "however , without multi - operator support , i.e. , when the two ends in the d2d pair have subscriptions with different , the business potential of commercial d2d communication would be very limited .",
    "the only available studies for multi - operator d2d can be found in  @xcite .",
    "both patents designed protocols to setup a d2d communication session considering different .",
    "however , they are not seen to address how the spectrum is allocated , which spectrum is used and how the communication mode is selected . in this paper , we assume that multi - operator d2d discovery has been handled , using for instance the protocol in  @xcite , and we propose algorithms for multi - operator d2d spectrum allocation and mode selection .    d2d communication can be enabled either over licensed or unlicensed spectrum .",
    "d2d communication in unlicensed bands would suffer from unpredictable interference .",
    "also it poses a requirement for two wireless communication interfaces and efficient power management at the d2d users  @xcite . due to these reasons , at this moment , licensed spectrum seems to be the way forward to enable d2d communication , especially considering safety related scenarios such as vehicle - to - vehicle communication . in the cellular band",
    ", either dedicated spectrum can be allocated to the d2d users ( a.k.a .",

    ", cellular users may suffer from inter - operator interference , and in order to resolve it , information exchange between the might be needed . due to the fact that may not be willing to reveal proprietary information to the competitors , we believe that , at a first stage , the overlay multi - operator d2d scheme would be easier to implement .    in this paper , we consider a scenario with two and we identify how much spectrum each should commit for overlay multi - operator d2d communication .",
    "the need not contribute equal amount of spectrum as they may have different network utilities and loads .",
    "we formulate a game where the make offers about the amount of spectrum they want to contribute and use a sequential best response to each other .",
    "the neither need to exchange proprietary information nor to communicate with an external party .",
    "also , they are not forced to take any action .",
    "if one party does not experience performance gain as compared to no sharing , the agreement can break and the communication among the devices is routed to the cellular infrastructure . besides spectrum allocation , the also need to agree about the mode selection scheme for the multi - operator d2d users . in principle , existing schemes for single - operator networks enabling d2d communication can be used .",
    "we consider the algorithm proposed in  @xcite where d2d communication mode is used only if the measured interference in the part of the cellular spectrum dedicated for d2d communication is low .",
    "we extend this algorithm to a multi - operator setting . given the mode selection scheme , we allocate spectrum for multi - operator d2d users for maximizing the d2d user rate while also meeting -specific user rate constraints . under these conditions , it turns out that the formulated game is concave , satisfies the dominance solvability condition , and is also sub - modular . as a result",
    ", one can prove that the best response optimization converges monotonously to the unique from any initial point .    using the proposed scheme",
    "we illustrate that both may experience significant performance gains as compared to no sharing . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work which uses a non - cooperative game theoretical model for spectrum allocation for multi - operator d2d communication .",

    "the locations of intra - operator d2d transmitters follow a with density @xmath4 and the locations of multi - operator d2d transmitters follow a with density @xmath5 . for the multi - operator d2d pairs , we assume that the densities of transmitters from different are equal , i.e. , @xmath6 . as a result , for the @xmath1-th ,",
    "the ratio of multi - operator d2d to intra - operator d2d transmitters is @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : multiop ] illustrates the d2d concept towards a multi - operator scenario .",
    "devices registered to different can communicate in a d2d manner or in infrastructure mode via the nearby serving .",
    "the spectrum controller is an entity to coordinate the agreement about spectrum allocation and mode selection between the peer networks .",

    "provided that the d2d pair distance @xmath30 is small , low interference at the d2d transmitter necessitates low interference at the d2d receiver .",
