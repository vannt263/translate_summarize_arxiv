    "the meson - baryon form factors are interesting and useful quantities for several reasons . for one thing",
    ", we expect the form factors to have some bearing on the underlying structure of the hadrons .",
    "for example , in perturbative chiral quark models@xcite the pion - baryon form factors are directly related to the quark wavefunctions in baryons .",
    "form factors are essential in the effective models of meson - baryon interactions since hadrons , after all , are not point particles .",
    "one also needs these form factors for a consistant description of nuclear phenomena .",
    "the meson exchange nucleon - nucleon potentials include phenomenological vertex form factors which are presumably related to the structure of hadrons .",
    "form factors are also needed in computation of photo- and electro- production of baryon resonances since , in principle , the photon can couple to the virtual charged meson cloud in a baryon .",
    "another technical reason for introducing the form factors is that the effective meson - baryon interaction models are , generally , not renormalizable and the form factors provide the needed cut - off functions .",
    "usually , the form factors employed in the meson - baryon interaction models are of monopole type ( @xmath2 ) with @xmath3 being the four momentum carried by the meson .",
    "it must be noted that the monopole form is , as such , purely phenomenological and is possibly not related to the underlying structure of the hadrons .",
    "the form factors used in earlier calculations@xcite were ` hard ' with the cut - off parameters @xmath4",
    ". there are , however , recent calculations@xcite which indicate that softer form factors ( @xmath5 ) are required to fit @xmath6 production on nuclei .",
    "some indication of the value of cut - off parameter @xmath7 is available from low energy phenomenology .",
    "for example , thomas and holinde@xcite argue that the 3% descripancy between @xmath8 and @xmath9 coupling constants@xcite is essentially due to the four - momentum variation of the @xmath10 form factor between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . with monopole parametrization of the form factor , @xmath7 of about 800 mev is required to explain this descripancy .",
    "similar arguments have been proposed by coon and scadron@xcite for @xmath13 .",
    "one should however note that these analyses are restricted to relatively small values of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and therefore can not determine the form factors at larger momentum transfers .",
    "recently , saito and afnan@xcite have investigated the dependence of triton binding energy on the @xmath10 form factor .",
    "they they compute the three - body @xmath16 force contribution to the triton binding energy .",
    "they claim that one can determine the @xmath10 form factor their model and it turns out that their renormalized form factor is softer with @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "schultz and holinde@xcite fit @xmath18 scattering data and obtain a form factor having @xmath19 .",
    "some attempts have been made to determine the pion - baryon form factor from qcd .",
    "for example , liu _",
    "et al._@xcite have used quenched lattice qcd calculations and extracted @xmath7 of 750 mev .",
    "t. meissner@xcite , on the other hand , has used qcd sum rules and obtained @xmath7 of about 800 mev .    in the present work ,",
    "the renormalised pseudoscalar meson baryon form factors are computed by using the chiral colour dielectric ( ccd ) model of baryons@xcite .",
    "the ccd model is based on the calculation of nielsen and patkos@xcite who showed that ` coarse graining ' of qcd the lagrangian on lattice gives rise to an effective scalar , colour - neutral field called colour dielectric field . in the ccd model , the the interaction of the colour dielectric field with the quark and gluon fields is such that it gives rise to the confinement of these objects .",
    "the chiral symmetry is restored in the ccd model by introducing the interaction of the pseudoscalar meson octet with the quarks@xcite .",
    "the ccd model has been used to compute properties of light baryon@xcite as well as @xmath18 scattering phase shifts@xcite .",
    "generally the agreement between the ccd model results and the experimental data is good . in particular ,",
    "a good agreement with the @xmath18 scattering phase shifts is obtained in the ccd model . in the @xmath18 work",
    ", the authors showed that solving of the relativistic lippmann - schwinger equation for pion - nucleon scattering leads to the renormalization of baryon masses and the pion - baryon veritces are also renormalized due to multiple scattering . however the renormalized vertex functions ( or form factors ) were not computed in that work .",
    "the present work is essentially an extension of the earlier work@xcite but here we have concentrated on renormalized form factors and have not compute @xmath18 scattering matrix .",
    "the basic idea here is as follows .",
    "the ccd model ( or , for that matter any other quark - based model with mesons coupling to quarks ) give bare meson - baryon form factors and bare baryon masses .",
    "these are then dressed by meson - baryon interactions . as we shall show later in the paper , computation of meson - baryon scattering ( including the pole positions of stable particles )",
    "leads to the determination of dressed baryon masses as well as dressed meson - baryon form factors .",
    "this is essentially achieved by rearranging the terms in the lippmann - schwinger series for the meson - baryon scattering matrix so that one obtains equations for the dressed baryon masses ( positions of the poles in the scattering matrix ) and meson - baryon form factors ( see the following sections for details ) .",
    "thus , one can compute the dressed pion baryon form factors .",
    "one should note here that these dressed ( or renormalized ) form form factors , and not the bare form factors should be used in nuclear physics calculations .",
    "some saliant features , of the results of our calculation are    1 .",
    "the renormalization of the form factors depends on the energy of the meson - baryon system . at zero momentum transfer ,",
    "the ratio of renormalized and bare form factors varies from about 1.1 to about 1.3 as the energy is increased from nucleon mass to @xmath6 mass .",
    "the renormalized form factors differ from the bare ones for meson momenta of 1 gev or smaller .",
    "there is practically no change at larger meson momenta .",
    "the form factors computed in the ccd model are soft .",
    "if one wants to fit the ccd model form factors by a monopole form in the region of 300 - 700 mev , corresponding @xmath7 is about 500 mev .    at this stage",
    "we would like to emphasize that our prescription of computing the renormalized form factors should be applicable to models having basic baryon - meson interaction as an input .",
    "that is , given a model for baryon - meson interaction lagrangian with bare baryon masses and form factors , one should compute the renormalized form factors by fitting the data ( cross sections , phase shifts , positions of the poles of the scattering matrix etc ) .",
    "these renormalized form factors should then be used in other nuclear physics calculations such as nn potentials , photo- and electro- production of mesons etc . in other words ,",
    "the parameters of the basic baryon - meson model are necessarily the bare parameters and should not be obtained directly from the experiments . if one does this then one is essentially choosing dressed parameters in the lagrangian and then one should use the model at tree level and should not compute meson loops for meson - nucleon scattering etc since that would amount to double counting .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a brief description of the ccd model is given and the bare masses and pion - baryon form factors are computed . in section 3 , begining with the lippmann - schwinger series , the the integral equations for the meson - baryon form factors are obtained . in section 4 ,",
    "the results of the calculation are presented and discussed .",
    "the ccd model is described and the bare masses of baryons and pseudoscalar meson - baryon vertices are computed in this section . the description of the ccd model is somewhat brief because in this work we want to focus on the computation of meson - baryon form factors . for the details of the ccd model",
    "the reader is refered to @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density of ccd model is given by@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are quark , gluon , scalar ( colour dielectric ) and meson fields respectively .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the masses of quark and meson , @xmath29 is the pion decay constant , @xmath30 is the usual colour electromagnetic field tensor , g is the colour coupling constant and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the usual gell - mann matrices acting in colour and flavour space respactively . the flavour symmetry breaking is incorporated in the lagrangian through the quark mass term @xmath33 , where @xmath34 for u and d quarks .",
    "so masses of u , d and s quarks are @xmath27 , @xmath27 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the meson matrix consists of a singlet @xmath36 , triplet of @xmath37 and quadruplet of @xmath38 .",
    "the self interaction @xmath39 of the scalar field is assumed to be of the form @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath39 has an absolute minimum at @xmath41 and a secondary inimum at @xmath42 .",
    "we would like to make the following observations on the lagrangian of eq(1 ) .    1 .",
    "the ccd model lagrangian is invaraint under chiral transformations if the mass terms of the pseudoscalar mesons are dropped .",
    "the coupling of the scalar field ( @xmath43 ) to the quark and gluon fields is such that the quark mass becomes infinite and the dielectric function ( @xmath44 ) vanishes when @xmath43 becomes zero .",
    "this means that the quarks and gluons can not exist in a region where @xmath43 becomes zero .",
    "that is the confinement of quarks and gluons is included in the model .",
    "the two minima of the self - interaction of the scalar field ( eq(2 ) ) can be identified with the perturbative and physical vacua of the mit bag model@xcite .",
    "thus , the ccd model is a dynamical model generating the bag .",
    "we follow the cloudy bag model approach@xcite in the present work and treat the gluon and meson interactions with the quarks perturbatively .",
    "therefore we expand the lagrangian in powers of @xmath45 and keep the terms up to order @xmath45 in the lagrangian of eq(1 ) . with this approximation",
    "the ccd model lagrangian becomes , @xmath46    the parameters of the ccd model are quark masses ( @xmath27 and @xmath47 ) , the ` bag constant ' ( @xmath48 ) , strong coupling constant ( @xmath49 ) , pion decay constant ( @xmath29 ) , glueball ( or dielectric field ) mass ( @xmath50 ) and the constant @xmath51 in @xmath39 .",
    "of these parameters , value of @xmath51 is chosen to be 24 since from our earlier calculations@xcite the results are not sensitive to it . to bigin with",
    ", we choose the experimental value of the pion decay constant ( @xmath52 ) in our calculations .",
    "as we shall see later , the value of @xmath29 required to fit pion - nucleon coupling constant is very close to @xmath53 .",
    "thus we are left with five free parameters to be adjusted . in our earlier calculations@xcite",
    "we found that a reasonably good fit to the baryon masses is obtained for @xmath27 and @xmath54 ranging between 100 and 140 mev .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath27 and @xmath54 in this range and adjust @xmath50 , @xmath55 and @xmath47 to fit nucleon , @xmath6 and @xmath7 masses .",
    "computed masses of other octet and decuplet baryons are within few percent of their experimental masses .",
    "the equations of motion of quark , gluon and colour dielectric fields can be obtained from the lagrangian of eq(3 ) . since we shall be treating the gluon interactins perturbatively , the quark and colour dielectric field equations of motion are solved self - consistantly .",
    "the gluon as well as pseudoscalar meson interactions are then treated perturbatively .",
    "this approach is similar to the one followed in the cloudy bag model calculations@xcite .",
    "thus the equations of motion for the quark and dielectric field are ,    @xmath56    and @xmath57 + \\sum_i \\frac{n_i m_i}{\\sigma^2_v \\chi^2(r ) } ( g_i^2(r)-f_i^2(r ) ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have assumed spherical symmetry in obtaining these equations .",
    "the equations of motion of quark and dielectric fields are solved self - consistantly with the boundary conditions that as @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 constant and @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",
    "the bare baryon states are constructed by putting three quarks of appropriate flavour in @xmath64 orbital .",
    "thus the baryon wavefunction is a product of symmetric space wavefunction , symmetric spin - flavour wavefunction and antisymmetric colour wavefunction@xcite .",
    "the mass of this state is computed by evaluating the matrix element of the hamiltonian @xmath65\\ ] ] in the bare baryon state .",
    "here @xmath66 is an annihilation operator of a quark in the state computed in eq(4 ) and @xmath67 is the momentum conjugate to the dielectric field @xmath43 .",
    "method of coherent states@xcite has been used to better account for the energy associated with the dielectric field . to this the colour - magnetic interaction between the quarks is added perturbatively ( see ref@xcite for details ) .",
    "the bare mass of the baryon is then @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the bare baryon state having zero momentum .",
    "this state is constructed by using peierls - yoccoz projection technique@xcite .",
    "it is convinient to express @xmath70 as @xmath71 where @xmath72 depends on the number of strange quarks in the baryon and @xmath73 depends on the spin - flavour wave function of the baryon .",

    "given the meson - baryon interaction hamiltonian of the previous section , one can compute the tree - level meson - baryon scattering matrix .",
    "it involves pole and crossed terms shown in fig .",
    "1 . these two terms constitute the driving term or potential for meson - baryon scattering . to obtain a unitary scattering matrix and to include multiple scattering effects",

    "= 14.5 cm    we would like to make several points regarding the t - matrix equation given above ( eq(12 ) ) .    1 .",
    "the t - matrix given above describes the scattering of one of the octet of the pseudoscalar mesons from the octet or decuplet of baryons .",
    "thus it represents resonance production , production of strange mesons and baryons etc .",
    "the channel energies @xmath95 in the lippmann - schwinger equation above are defined in terms of the physical baryon masses since these are the physically observable states .",
    "however the masses of baryons in the intermediate state of the pole and crossed terms are the bare masses defined in the previous section .",
    "3 .   the poles of the t - matrix in appropriate spin - flavour channel of the meson - baryon system should coincide with the physical masses of the baryons .",
    "this means that the parameters of the ccd model ( basically the glueball mass @xmath50 , strong coupling constant @xmath55 and @xmath47 ) are to be adjusted to obtain the best fit to the physical baryon masses defined by the pole positions of the t - matrix .",
    "given the potential @xmath96 , one can solve the lippmann - schwinger equation and obtain the phase shifts and cross sections for meson - baryon scattering .",
    "for this purpose , it is best to expand the t - matrix equation in spin - isospin channels of the meson - baryon system@xcite and solve partial wave lippmann - schwinger equation . as mention earlier , when one solves the lippmann - schwinger equation renormalization of baryon masses as well as the form factors is already included .",
    "however one can not compute the renormalized form factors using this procedure .",
    "since we are interested in computing the renormalized form factors in the present work , we do not want to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation as such .",
    "instead , we express the lippmann - schwinger equation as a multiple scattering series . from this series",
    "we obtain integral equations for the renormalized form factors by summing up parts of the series .",
    "we also obtain the expressions for the renormalized masses .",
    "the details of this exercise are outlined in appendix b. the result is an integral equation for the renormalized form factor @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath70 are renormalized and bare masses of baryon b respectively , @xmath104 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the spin and isospin of baryon @xmath48 respectively and @xmath105 s are the usual rakah coefficients .",
    "the equation for the renormalised propagator of a baryon b is @xmath106 where the self energy @xmath107 is @xmath108 where @xmath6 is 0 , -1/2 , 1/2 , 0 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath109 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the renormalized propagator has a pole at @xmath110 .",
    "thus the renormalized mass of baryon @xmath103 is given by @xmath111 note that eqs(13 - 16 ) are coupled equations since renormalized masses and form factors appear in these equations .",
    "thus these equations need to be solved self - consistantly .",
    "we can now use the renormalized form factors and propagators in the expression for the scattering matrix .",
    "we then get , @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 here @xmath115 is the crossed term shown in fig 1 . a diagramatic representation of the t - matrix is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    = 14.5 cm    the interpretation of eq(17 ) is obvious .",
    "the first term represents the pole or resonance contribution which is given in terms of * physical * masses of resonances and * renormalized * form factors or vertex functions .",
    "the rest of the contribution is lumped into the second term which can be considered as a background .",
    "clearly , if our model is extended to include higher order terms or exchanges of heavier mesons , these will predominantly affect the background term .",
    "usually the t - matrix is computed by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation using a suitable numerical technique ( eg matrix inversion method@xcite ) or by summing the lippmann schwinger series numerically to a desired accuracy .",
    "alternatively , one can now compute the renormalized form factors and propagators and use them to evaluate the t - matrix .",
    "the computation of the pole term of the scattering matrix is very simple in this case . for the crossed term @xmath116",
    "however one has to solve an integral equation ( eq(19 ) ) .",
    "our computations show that the crossed term of the t - matrix can be computed iteratively and the convergence is rapid .",
    "we also find that the dominant contribution to the scattering matrix comes from the pole term .",
    "one should note that the computation of the renormalized form factor already includes a large number of terms involving the crossed diagram of the meson - baryon potential .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that @xmath116 appearing in the t - matrix equation ( eq(19 ) ) is somewhat less important , particularly near the resonance .",
    "note that pole term of the t - matrix @xmath117 defined in eq(18 ) has a singularity at @xmath118 .",
    "if this singularity occures at physical energy , it means that the particle @xmath119 can decay and that should be reflected in the mass of the particle .",
    "that is the physical mass defined above should have an imaginary part corresponding to the width of the baryon @xmath119 .",
    "the renormalised form factors are computed by solving eq(13 ) above iteratively .",
    "we find that the iterative procedure does converge and the convergence is reached within fifteen iterations .",
    "note that the integrand of the form factor integral equation has singularities due to the energy denominators and the integral should be regularised properly .",
    "we have used principal value prescription for this purpose .",
    "the results of the calculation are discussed in the following section .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the results of our calculation .",
    "the precedure adopted for the calculation is as outlined below .",
    "the coupled quark and dielectric field equations are first solved and bare baryon states are constructed .",
    "the bare baryon masses are computed by evaluating the matrix element of the hamiltonian ( eq(6 ) ) in the momentum - projected bare baryon states and including the colour magnetic interaction .",
    "the baryon masses are essentially functions of @xmath50 , @xmath55 and @xmath47 ( @xmath27 and @xmath54 are kept fixed for a given parameter set ) .",
    "also , using the momentum - projected baryon baryon wavefunctions the bare form factors ( vertex functions ) for baryon - meson coupling are computed .",
    "these are then used in eq(13 ) and the renormalised form factors are computed . in principle , one could use matrix inversion method@xcite for this purpose .",
    "however we find that the dimensionality of the matrices is prohibitively large because we are considering coupling to all the octet of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we therefore solve eq(13 ) iteratively .",
    "we find that the convergence is reached after 10 - 15 iterations .",
    "using the renormalised form factors the renormalised masses are computed by using eq(16 ) .",
    "the parameters of ccd model ( @xmath50 , @xmath55 and @xmath47 ) are then adjusted to fit the renormalised masses to the physical masses .    for the comparison with the experimental data we consider the @xmath10 and @xmath120 coupling constants at nucleon and delta masses respectively .",
    "conventionally , in terms of the nonrelativistic @xmath10 interaction hamiltonian , the @xmath10 coupling constant @xmath121 is defined as@xcite @xmath122\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are nucleon spin and isospin operators respectively , @xmath125 is the form factor defined to be unity when @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the annihilation operator for pion field .",

    "similarly , @xmath131 .",
    "computations have been done for a number of parameter sets of ccd model .",
    "the results are quite similar for all these sets so long as @xmath50 is between 800 and 1200 mev .",
    "therefore we have chosen one of the representative parameter set ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) for a detailed discussion .",
    "the pion decay constant @xmath29 has been fixed at its physical value ( 93 mev ) . the bare and renormalized @xmath10 and @xmath137 form factors evaluated at nucleon delta masses are displayed in fig 3 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the renormalizes form factors differ from the bare form factor at three momentum transfers smaller than 1 gev .",
    "an inspection of eq(13 ) shows why this happens . as the momentum transfer increases , the first term in the denominator of integrand also increases because of increase in @xmath138 . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of the integral to the form factor decreases with the increase in the momentum transfer . even at momentum transfers smaller than 1 gev",
    ", the change in the form factor is about 10 % for @xmath139 and 30% for @xmath140 .",
    "thus one could conclude that the effects of renormalization are relatively minor .",

    "this value of @xmath7 is about same at the one obtained by various authors@xcite .",
    "however one must note that as function of momentum transfer , the monopole form factor falls off more slowly than the ccd model form factor .",
    "we find that a better fit to the ccd model form factor is obtained by using dipole or gausian form .",
    "in fact , we find that if we replace the bare ccd model form factor by a dipole or gaussian form factor , we get practically the same results .",
    "if , on the other hand , one wants that the monopole form factor should be close to @xmath142 for @xmath143 , @xmath5 .",
    "the computed value of the @xmath10 coupling constant is 0.254 .",
    "this value is about 9% smaller than the experimental @xmath144 .",
    "this , by itself , can be considered as a success of the ccd model .",
    "the @xmath144 as well as the baryon can be fitted by decreasing the pion decay constant @xmath29 to 86 mev ( a 7% decrease ) .",
    "it may be mentioned here that this change in @xmath29 does not affect the computed properties of baryons very much .",
    "let us now consider the ratio of @xmath137 and @xmath10 coupling constants evaluated at nucleon and delta masses respectively .",
    "this ratio is @xmath145 for bare coupling constants , as dictated by @xmath146 symmetry . for renormalised coupling constants",
    "this ratio is about 2.15 , which is very close to the experimental value of 2.14@xcite .",
    "we believe that this is a very important result emerging from our calculation .",
    "this result implies that , to begin with , the quark model value of the ratio , which is about 25% off the experimental value , is itself a good starting point . in other words ,",
    "the bare coupling constants in the ccd model themselves are in qualitative agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the renormalization of these quantities , which should be done in any case , is able to produce a very good agreement with the experimental result .",
    "incidently , we would like to note that when @xmath147 the @xmath10 coupling constant agrees with the experimental value and the ratio of @xmath137 and @xmath10 coupling constants still remains close to 2.15 .",
    "= 14.5 cm    the energy dependence of @xmath148 and @xmath149 is shown in fig .",
    "the figure shows that the coupling constants increase with the energy in the energy range shown .",
    "the chiral colour dielectric model has been used in this work to compute renormalized meson - baryon form factors .",
    "this has been done by writing the lippmann - schwinger equation in a series form and deriving the integral equation for the renormalized form factor .",
    "we find that the renormalization effects are primarily restricted to the meson momenta smaller than 1 gev .",
    "the increase in the form factor at zero meson momentum is about 10% at nucleon mass and about 30% at @xmath6 mass .",

    "this ratio for bare coupling constants is 1.697 .",
    "thus the renormalization effects yield a good agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "the computed form factors are soft with the equivalent monopole parameter @xmath7 of about 800 mev if fitting is done at small momentum transfers .",
    "however , the ccd model form factors decrease faster than the monopole form factor for large momenta and the ccd form factors are closer to gaussian or dipole forms .",
    "strictly speaking , the computations done in this work are not fully relativistic although relativistic expressions for energies of the baryons are used . for a completely relativistic calculation , one will need to use relativistic propagators for baryons and use a relativistic integral equation , such as blankenbeckler - sugar equation instead of relativistic scrodinger equation that is used in the present work .",
    "indeed it is technically possible to do this , with some increase in the complexity of the problem .",
    "however we feel that the approach followed in the present work is reasonable since we have restricted ourselves to kinetic energies small in comparison with the baryon masses .",
    "extension of the present calculation to higher energies would require the above - mentioned relativistic generalizations as well as inclusion of heavier baryon resonances .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "r. h. landau for useful discussions .",

    "also @xmath84 implies the meson type ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath109 and @xmath36 ) and their total isospins and projections along z - axis are represented by @xmath168 and @xmath83 respectively . the baryon spin ( isospin ) and its projection",
    "is represented by @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath169 ( @xmath82 ) respectively .",
    "the reduced matrix element @xmath85 and the phase factor @xmath86 are determined by exlpicit calculation of one matrix element , as is usually done .",
    "the phase factor @xmath86 is @xmath83 , 0 , @xmath170 and 0 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath109 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "one can derive the equations for renormalized form factors and masses by writing the t - matrix equation in a lippmann - schwinger series and summing parts of the series .",
    "this procedure , however , is somewhat cumbersome . on the other hand ,",
    "same conclusions can be arrived at by considering the graphical representation of the series .",
    "we have therefore shown the diagrams corresponding to the individual terms of the lippmann - schwinger series for the t - matrix of eq ( ) in fig(5 ) .",
    "the figure shows the diagrams upto @xmath171",
    ". it should be clear that one can easily generalize the conclusions drawn from the analysis of these diagrams to the full lippmann - schwinger series .",
    "the diagrams in fig(7 ) are organized as follows .",
    "the diagrams in the first line renormalize the right - most vertex . the diagrams in the second line renormalize left - most vertex and the diagrams in the third line renormalize the mass or the propagator of the intermediate baryon .",
    "the diagrams in the fourth line are the mixed diagrams representing renormalization of vertices as well as mass . finally , the diagrams in the last line are the rest of the diagrams which do not give rise to renormalization . generalizing the diagrams in the first line to all orders , we obtain an integral equation for the renormalization of vertex ( form factor ) .",
    "diagramatically , this is represented in fig(6 ) where the filled circle represents the renormalized form factor .",
    "the corresponding integral equation obtained after some angular momentum algebra is @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath70 are renormalized and bare masses of baryon b respectively , @xmath172 with @xmath173 being 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath109 and @xmath36 respectively , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the spin and isospin of baryon @xmath48 respectively and @xmath105 s are the usual rakah coefficients .",
    "now consider the mass renormalization .",
    "the relevent diagrams are shown in fig(7 ) . clearly , the third line in this diagram is the schwinger - dyson equation for the propagator with the self energy being given by the meson loop .",
    "the thing to notice , however , is that one of the meson - baryon form factor appearing in the self energy is a renormalized one where as the other is a bare one . assuming that the computation is done in the frame in which the baryon is stationary , the renormalized and bare propagators are @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively .",
    "the self energy @xmath176 is @xmath177 where @xmath6 is 0 , -1/2 , 1/2 , 0 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath109 and @xmath36 respectively .",
