    "the backreaction of the `` light '' sub - system on the `` heavy '' sub - system dynamics through a gauge vector and scalar potentials was already geometrized @xcite .",
    "it comes from the adiabatic born - oppenheimer ansatz applied to the coupled sub - systems . on the other hand aharonov _",

    "authors emphasize the necessity of `` second particle '' usage .",
    "cartan s method of the moving frame , however , rids us from this obligation .",
    "namely , the quantum state and dynamical variables of a quantum system may be referred to the infinitesimally close previous state .",
    "thereby one is able to restore the objective interpretation of the quantum description .",
    "but transition to moving frame in hilbert space requires the especial control of the elements proximity since the non - adiabatic approximation ( where transitions are available ) realized by transition to moving frame leads to divergences of the iteration process even for two - level system @xcite .",
    "the fundamental gauge field coming  from nowhere \" in the models of elementary particles , and both abelian @xcite and non - abelian @xcite pseudo - potentials associated with adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation , have formally geometric origin .",
    "pseudo - potentials have a singular source of monopole - like type whose nature arose under degeneration , etc .",
    "dirac put the monopole as a physical source of electromagnetic field .",
    "he assumed that singularities are concentrated on some  line of the knots \" in the physical space .",
    "but the mathematical artefact , say , singularity of mapping cannon be a reason for physical phenomenon .",
    "on the other hand monopoles do not exist as physical object up to now ; one should have physical mechanism of the fields generation .",
    "the first question is : is it possible to find a non - singular fundamental gauge potential if one uses local coordinates in inherently related projective hilbert space @xmath0 instead of the parameter space ?",
    "the second question was posed by berry :  what is the dynamical significance of the moving frame that produce the best approximation to @xmath1 , ... ? \" @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons of  defeats \" of the renormalization procedure by the successive transitions to moving frame @xcite .",
    "the first of them is lurked in the local ( state - dependent ) character of embedding both the isotropy sub - group @xmath2 of some state vector and the coset transformations @xmath3 into the @xmath4 group .",
    "the second reason is that the berry s condition of the  parallel transport \" @xmath5 is not affine , i.e. it is nor invariant relative fubini - study metric neither even linear @xcite .    in the framework of my model the reason of anholonomy",
    "is generated by the curvature of the dynamical group manifold and its invariant sub - manifold @xmath0 .",
    "such geometry is the true source of some non - singular physical fields .",
    "the affine parallel transport agrees with fubibi - study leads presumably to the  best approximation \" in quantum dynamics .",
    "it is interesting that the similar problem and the necessity to take into account the structure of the projective hilbert space arise in quite different physical problem .    for quantum states of a compound system",
    "whose parts obeys the super - selection rule ( atom , e.g. ) we have schrdinger or heizenberg equations of motion .",
    "the problem to find an approximate dynamical states has a formally clear formulation but it seldom has the physically acceptable solutions for quantum field system @xcite .",
    "divergences arising here are rooted into infinite degrees of freedom , that was demonstrated in very simple example @xcite .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the orthogonal projection along of the vacuum state i.e. the subtraction the ` longitudinal ' component of the variation velocity of the state @xmath6 is merely partly helpful .",
    "let put @xmath7 to be creation operator and @xmath8 is deformed standard vector , so that @xmath9 , therefore , @xmath10 and , hence , @xmath11 . now we can express the ` transversal ' part of the standard vector deformation representing in fact the tangent vector to @xmath12 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "let me calculate only the ` transversal ' components of the @xmath14 which i will define as follows : @xmath15 now i apply this definition to calculation of all orders of @xmath16 : @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19 hence one sees that divergences alive in the third order and that the compensation projective term does not help .",
    "nevertheless , we can extract the useful hint : the vacuum vector ( the standard vector in dirac s example ) should be smoothly changed , and , furthermore , the transversal component should be reduced during the `` smooth '' evolution .",
    "one may image some a smooth  surface \" in the functional state space with a normal vector , taking the place of the vacuum vector and tangent vectors comprising together the local reference frame .",
    "it is natural to start with finite dimensional complex projective hilbert space @xmath0 closely related to eigen - problem and where limit @xmath20 may be easy achieved @xcite .",
    "then the orthogonal projection acting continuously is in fact the complex covariant differentiation of the tangent vector fields @xcite .",
    "the assumption that local moving reference frame in the complex projective hilbert space generates some fields was called super - relativity @xcite .",
    "intrinsic unification of quantum and relativity and the verification of the physical status of these fields require dynamical ( state - dependent ) space - time construction and modification of the second quantization method .",
    "the peaceful coexistence between quantum behavior and classical relativity ( both special and general ) is highly desirable but it looks like the far distant future @xcite .",
    "all known attempts to reach the harmony ( strings , super - gravity , e.g. ) lead to very strange unobservable predictions ( super - partners ) and they require entirely to change our scientific paradigm ( anthropic principle , multiverse ) .",
    "i propose much more modest approach .",
    "it was recognized that the space - time is macroscopically observable as global pseudo - riemannian manifold is only obtrusive illusion from the quantum point of view .",
    "namely , the operational coordinatization of classical events by means of _ electromagnetic field _ is based on the distinguishability , i.e. individualization of pointvise material points .",
    "however we loss this possibility by means of _ quantum fields_. generally , it is important to understand that the problem of identification is the root problem even in classical physics and that its recognition gave to einstein the key to formalization of the relativistic kinematics and dynamics . indeed , only assuming the possibility to detect locally the coincidence of two pointwise events of a different nature it is possible to build all kinematic scheme and the physical geometry of space - time @xcite .",
    "as such the  state \" of the local clock gives us local coordinates - the  state \" of the incoming train . in the classical case",
    "the notions of the  clock \" and the  train \" are intuitively clear .",
    "furthermore , einstein especially notes that he did not discuss the inaccuracy of the simultaneity of two _ approximately coincided events _ that should be overcame by some abstraction @xcite .",
    "this abstraction is of course the neglect of finite sizes ( and all internal degrees of freedom ) of the both real clock and train .",
    "it gives the representation of these  states \" by mathematical points in space - time .",
    "thereby the local identification of two events is the formal source of the classical relativistic theory .",
    "but in the quantum case such identification is impossible since the localization of quantum particles is state - dependent @xcite .",
    "hence the identification of quantum events ( transitions ) requires a physically motivated operational procedure with corresponding mathematical description .",
    "therefore it is inconsistent to start the development of the quantum theory from the space - time symmetries because just the space - time properties should be established in some approximation to internal quantum dynamics , i.e. literally _ a posteriori_. namely , the quantum measurement with help of the  quantum question \" leads locally to the lorentz transformations of its spinor components , and , on the other hand , to dynamical ( state - dependent ) space - time coordinatization .",
    "that is , instead of the representation of the poincare group in some extended hilbert space , i used an  inverse representation \" of the @xmath21 by solutions of relativistic quasi - linear pde in the dynamical space - time .",
    "the concept of the  elementary particles \" can not be applied to the problem of identification of quantum events since we are lacking for consistent qft at the sub - atomic level . in the absence of super - selection rule ,",
    "the role of the most universal building blocks might play the action amplitudes .",
    "i propose some discrete quantum model based on the concept of the  elementary quantum states \" ( eqs ) @xmath22 @xcite . in the framework of this model",
    "it is assumed that the planck s hypothesis should be literally applied to the action quantization .",
    "it is clear that the state @xmath23 belongs to some sector @xmath24 and there is the continuum of eqs s in each sector ( space - time / energy - momentum distribution splits them in a  zone \" ) .",
    "the space - time representation of eqs s and their coherent superposition is postponed on the dynamical stage as it is described below .",
    "we shall construct non - linear field equations describing energy ( frequency ) distribution between eqs s @xmath23 , whose soliton - like solution provides the quantization of the dynamical variables .",
    "presumably , the stationary processes are represented by stable particles and quasi - stationary processes are represented by unstable resonances .",
    "since the action in itself does not create gravity , it is possible to create the linear superposition of @xmath25 constituting @xmath26 multiplete of the planck s action quanta operator @xmath27 with the spectrum @xmath28 in the separable hilbert space @xmath29 .",
    "this superposition physically corresponds to the complete amplitude of some quantum motion or a process .",
    "generally the coherent superposition @xmath30 such vacuum is more general than so - called ",
    "@xmath31-vacuum \" @xmath32 has here different sense as it was mentioned above .",

    "this deviates in general from this value on superposed states @xmath36 and of course under non - trivial choice of the @xmath37-function : @xmath38 .",
    "the relative ( local ) vacuum of some problem is not necessarily the state with minimal energy but sometimes it may be interpreted as a extremal of the action functional of a classical ( or ordinary quantum ) variational problem .",
    "in fact only finite , say , @xmath39 elementary quantum states ( eqs s ) ( @xmath40 ) may be involved in the coherent superposition @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath41 and the ray space @xmath12 will be restricted to finite dimensional @xmath0 .",
    "hereafter we will use the indices as follows : @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . due to the discreteness of the our model , the variation problem may be reduced simply to the differentiation of the complex tensor fields .",
    "let me assume that one deals with the eigen - problem for some action operator @xmath44 acting in @xmath45 .",
    "its an eigen - vector lies in the ray @xmath46 and the last one marks the extremum point of the action functional @xmath47 $ ] belonging to @xmath0 . since we have not yet the space - time representations for this state and for any dynamical variables one should find the invariant conditions for the stability of the extremum from the @xmath21 geometry .",
    "the unitary transformation @xmath48 leaves this ray intact @xmath49 has only one non - zero component , say , @xmath50 it has the isotropy ( stationary ) group @xmath51 generated by the @xmath52-subset of the @xmath53-matrices .",
    "thereby , such representation of @xmath54 dictates the state - dependent parametrization of the embedding isotropy group @xmath52 into @xmath55 and this parametrization is unstable relative general unitary transformations in the following sense .",
    "any transformation from @xmath52 leaves the @xmath54 intact , but arbitrary transformation from the coset @xmath56 deforms the structure of the @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to see if one applies the general coset operator @xmath57 ^ 2 ( \\cos g\\tau -1)&[\\frac{p^1 p^{2*}}{g}]^2 ( \\cos g\\tau -1)&.&[\\frac{p^1 p^{n-1*}}{g}]^2 ( \\cos g\\tau -1 ) \\cr .&.&.&.&. \\cr .&.&.&.&. \\cr",

    "in order to return to the ( [ vac])-form one should use @xmath52 transformations . therefore the parameterizations of @xmath52 and @xmath59 and their action are state - dependent ( local in the state space ) .",
    "it means that the cartan s decomposition and the representation of the @xmath21 generators should be state - dependent @xcite .",
    "these local dynamical variables corresponding to the @xmath21 group should be expressed now in terms of the local coordinates @xmath60 .",
    "hence local dynamical variables , their norms should be state - dependent , i.e. they are functions of the local coordinates @xmath60 in the complex projective hilbert state space @xcite with the fubini - study metric @xmath61(1 + \\sum |\\pi^s|^2)^{-2 } \\label{fs}\\ ] ] and the affine connection @xmath62    these generators give the infinitesimal shift of the @xmath63-component of the generalized coherent state driven by the @xmath64-component of the unitary field @xmath65 rotating the standard pauli , gell - mann , ... , @xmath53-matrices of the @xmath66 realization .",

    "namely , @xmath70 generators of @xmath71 may be divided in accordance with the cartan decomposition : @xmath72 \\in h , [ b , h ] \\in b , [ b , b ] \\in h$ ] . the @xmath73 generators @xmath74 of the isotropy group @xmath75 of the ray ( cartan sub - algebra ) and @xmath76 generators @xmath77 are the coset @xmath78 $ ] generators realizing the breakdown of the @xmath71 symmetry of the gcs .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath73 generators of the cartan sub - algebra may be divided into the two sets of operators : @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the rank of @xmath66 ) abelian operators , and @xmath81 non - abelian operators corresponding to the non - commutative part of the cartan sub - algebra of the isotropy ( gauge ) group .",
    "note , this representation of the generators has been found by the infinitesimal action of the group parameters ( unitary fields driven by the infinitesimal real @xmath82 ) .",
    "however the finite unitary fields obey some fields equations expressing _ the conservation laws of the identity _ which will be discussed below .",
    "let me return to the geometry of the quantum evolution .",
    "for this aim it is convenient to use well known berry works .",
    "berry in his construction of the geometric phase used some intuitive analogy between the tangent vector @xmath83 to the some sphere @xmath84 and the state vector @xmath85 whose time dependence is generated by the periodic hamiltonian @xmath86 .",
    "i will assume that vector state is a tangent vector to the projective hilbert space @xmath0 where instead of an arbitrary parameters @xmath87 of the hamiltonian i will use intrinsic local projective coordinates @xmath60 of the quantum states and local dynamical variables .",
    "their parallel transport is required to be in agreement with the fubini - study metric .",
    "then the affine connection takes the place of the gauge potential of the non - abelian type playing the role of the covariant instant renormalization of the dynamical variables during general transformations of the quantum self - reference frame @xcite .",
    "let me assume that @xmath88 is a  ground state \" of some the least action problem , where for @xmath89 one has @xmath90 and for @xmath91 one has @xmath92 then the velocity of the ground state evolution relative  world time \" @xmath93 is given by the formula @xmath94 is the tangent vector to the evolution curve @xmath95 , where @xmath96 i should emphasize that  world time \" is the time of evolution from the one gcs to another one which is physically distinguishable .",
    "thereby the unitary evolution of the action amplitudes generated by ( 12 ) leads in general to the non - unitary evolution of the tangent vector to @xmath0 associated with ",
    "state vector \" @xmath97 .",
    "then the variation velocity of the @xmath97 is given by the equation @xmath98 where i introduce the matrix @xmath99 of the second quadratic form whose components are defined by following equations @xmath100 through the state @xmath101 normal to the `` hypersurface '' of the ground states . assuming that the `` acceleration '' @xmath102 is gotten by the action of some linear  hamiltonian \" @xmath103 describing the evolution ( or a measurement ) , one has the  schrdinger equation of evolution \" @xmath104 this ",

    "i.e. under the condition of the affine parallel transport of the hamiltonian vector field . the last equations in ( 25 ) shows that the affine parallel transport of @xmath108 agrees with fubini - study metric ( 13 ) leads to berry s  parallel transport \" of @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "geometrically this picture corresponds to the special choice of the moving reference frame @xmath109 on @xmath0 that only `` longitudinal '' component along @xmath101 is alive .",
    "the berry s formula ( 1.24 ) @xcite may be applied to the eigen - vector with coordinates ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) in the local coordinates @xmath110 .",
    "supposing @xmath111 one found the 2-form as follows : @xmath112(1 + \\sum |\\pi^s|^2)^{-2}= - \\im g_{ik^ * } \\label{form}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which closely related to fubini - study metric ( quantum metric tensor ) .",
    "there are , however , two important differences between original berry s formula referring to arbitrary parameters and this 2-form in local coordinates inherently connected with eigen - problem .    \\1 .",
    "the @xmath113 is the singular - free expression .",

    "these field equations of motion for quantum system whose ` particles ' do not exist a priory but they are becoming during the evolution . but first of all we should to introduce the notion of the  dynamical space - time \" which is arises due to the natural evolution or the objective measurement of some dynamical variable .",
    "the  probability \" may be introduced now by pure geometric way like @xmath120 in tangent state space as follows .",
    "for any two tangent vectors @xmath121 one can define the scalar product @xmath122 then the value @xmath123 may be treated as a relative probability of the appearance of two states arising during the measurements of two different dynamical variables @xmath124 by the variation of the initial gcs @xmath125 .",
    "the @xmath0 manifold takes the place of the `` classical phase space '' since its points , corresponding to the gcs , are most close to classical states of motion .",
    "the interpretations may be given for the points of @xmath0 as the  schrdinger s lump \" @xcite . as we will see later ,",
    "the important fact is in my case the  schrdinger s lump \" has the exact mathematical description and clear physical interpretation : points of @xmath0 are the axis of the ellipsoid of the action operator @xmath44 , i.e. extremals of the action functional @xmath47 $ ] . then the velocities of variation of these axis correspond to local hamiltonian or different local dynamical variables .",
    "the basic content of @xmath0 points is their physical interpretation as discriminators of physically distinguishable quantum states . as such",
    ", they may be used as `` yes / no '' states of some two - level  detector \" .",
    "let me assume that gcs described by local coordinates @xmath126 corresponds to the original lump , and the coordinates @xmath127 correspond to the lump displaced due to measurement .",
    "i will use a gcs @xmath125 of some action operator @xmath128 representing physically distinguishable states .",
    "this means that any two points of @xmath0 define two ellipsoids differ at least by the orientations , if not by the shape , as it was discussed above .",
    "local coordinates of the lump gives the a firm geometric tool for the description of quantum dynamics during interaction which used for a measuring process or evolution .",
    "the question that i would like to raise is as follows : _ what `` classical field '' , i.e. field in space - time , corresponds to the transition from the original to the displaced lump ? _ in other words i would like to find the measurable physical manifestation of the lump , which we shall call the  field shell \" , its space - time shape and its dynamics .",
    "the lump s dynamics will be represented by ( energy ) frequencies distribution that are not a priori given , but are defined by some field equations which should established by means of variation problem applied to operators represented by tangent vectors to @xmath0 .",
    "the eigen - problem @xmath129 for  expectation state \" reads now as follows : @xmath130 putting @xmath131 one has simple solutions @xmath132 restricting velocities @xmath133 through the equation @xmath134 the general self - consistent case is of course very complicated .    in order to build the spinor @xmath135 of the quantum question @xmath136 @xcite in the local basis @xmath109 for",

    "<S> the relativity to the measuring device in quantum theory , i.e. the covariance of local dynamical variables relative transformations to moving quantum reference frame in hilbert space , may be achieved only by the rejection of super - selection rule . in order to avoid the subjective nuance , i emphasis that the notion of  measurement \" here , is nothing but the covariant differentiation procedure in the functional quantum phase space @xmath0 , having pure objective sense of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> transition to the local moving quantum reference frame leads to some particle - like solutions of quasi - linear field pde in the dynamical space - time . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , the functionally covariant quantum dynamics gives the perspective to unify the einstein relativity and quantum principles which are obviously contradictable under the standard approaches .    </S>",
