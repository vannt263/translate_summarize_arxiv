    "the aim of this paper is to study possible connections between two perspectives on the glass transition @xcite .",
    "one is the mosaic , or entropic droplet , view that follows from the random first - order transition theory of kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes ( ktw ) @xcite : a deeply supercooled liquid is viewed as a patchwork of correlated mesoscopic regions which relax by entropically driven nucleation events .",
    "these `` mosaics '' are characterised by a length scale that diverges on approach to a temperature @xmath0 , where a kauzmann @xcite entropy crisis occurs .",
    "the growth of static correlations , under certain assumptions for droplet nucleation , leads to a divergence of relaxation times of the vogel - fulcher kind @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "the second , in principle very different , approach is based on the idea of dynamic facilitation @xcite : glassiness is not due to any precipitous thermodynamics , but is a consequence of effective constraints in the dynamics . here",
    ", the central feature is dynamic heterogeneity @xcite , and the corresponding dynamic scaling , i.e. , growing times are accompanied by growing dynamic , but not necessarily static , correlation lengths @xcite . in this view",
    "there are no finite temperature singularities , and scaling properties are controlled by zero temperature critical points where dynamic lengths and times diverge @xcite .",
    "the simplest models that realize this perspective are kinetically constrained lattice models , such as the facilitated spin models of fredrickson and andersen ( fa ) and jackle s east model @xcite .    here",
    "we study lattice spin models with plaquette interactions @xcite from the mosaic or entropic droplet perspective .",
    "the two models we consider are the square plaquette model ( spm ) @xcite and the triangular plaquette model ( tpm ) @xcite .",
    "these models have exact dual descriptions : one in terms of interacting spin variables with standard single - spin glauber dynamics ; another in terms of free excitations with dynamics subject to kinetic constraints .",
    "the dynamics of the spm is like that of the facilitated fa model @xcite , the dynamics of the tpm , like that of the east model @xcite .    while plaquette models are realizations of the dynamic facilitation scenario , they also allow for a detailed and explicit analysis using the mosaic approach .",
    "they therefore allow a direct analysis of the similarities and differences between the facilitation and the mosaic perspectives on glasses . in this work",
    ", we apply to these models the procedure recently suggested by bouchaud and biroli ( bb ) @xcite , by which the mosaic lengthscale is estimated from the partition function of finite droplets within a larger system .",
    "we show that low temperature states do resemble mosaic states , and that the associated lengths can be extracted using the bb procedure .",
    "we also show that these thermodynamic lengthscales have the same scaling as those extracted from bulk many - point static correlations , and from multi - point dynamical correlation functions which measure dynamic heterogeneity . in the case of the spm ,",
    "the static analysis gives two typical caging lengths , a feature not anticipated in bb .",
    "moreover , the relation between caging lengths and relaxation times in these models is not that expected from the mosaic approach , as the nucleation assumptions miss the relevant transition states and overestimate the free - energy barriers to droplet melting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii",
    "we give a summary of the arguments of ktw and bb , and make general observations about the applicability of this approach to the models studied in this work . in section iii",
    "we apply the mosaic procedure to the spm , and compare the lengthscales obtained with other relevant static and dynamic lengths of the system .",
    "in section iv we repeat the analysis for the tpm .",
    "finally , in section v we give our conclusions .",
    "the basic arguments underlying the bb procedure to compute a mosaic lengthscale are the following @xcite .",
    "imagine a glassy state in which an atom is prevented from moving by the fact that its neighbours are fixed in position .",
    "this picture is consistent only insofar as the neighbours of the original atom are fixed by their neighbours , and so on .",
    "consider now the original atom and its neighbours as a small droplet .",
    "one can compute the probability that the droplet can relax , assuming that its boundaries are fixed .",
    "if this probability is small then rearrangements require correlated motion over distances larger than this droplet .",
    "one must then increase the droplet size and recalculate the probability of rearrangement . in a system with finite - ranged interactions ,",
    "as the droplet is made larger , we eventually cross over to a regime where the rearrangement probability is large .",
    "all larger droplets will be then able to rearrange by sequential moves of this type .",
    "this crossover defines the mosaic lengthscale @xcite .",
    "the result is a picture of a glassy state in which droplets of small sizes are jammed , or frozen , by their boundaries , whereas those with large sizes are unjammed , or melted .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the typical lengthscale separating jammed and unjammed droplets increases .",
    "( the idea of using finite size scaling to extract a lengthscale is not at all new , of course .",

    "the above remarks can be made quantitative by way of three assumptions @xcite :    \\(i ) a droplet of size @xmath1 contains very many metastable states whose number scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the configurational entropy density which vanishes at the kauzmann temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "\\(ii ) the probability of finding a droplet in a given state @xmath4 , given that its boundary conditions are in the state @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a partition sum , @xmath8 is the free energy density of state @xmath4 and @xmath9 is the free energy cost of matching the bulk state @xmath4 to the boundary state @xmath5 .",
    "the exponent @xmath10 should satisfy @xmath11 in a short ranged system .",

    ", the mosaic lengthscale is @xmath27 the configurational energy of the droplet is thought to vanish at some finite @xmath0 , which leads to the divergence of @xmath17 at that temperature @xcite .    combining these thermodynamical arguments , with assumption ( iii ) above",
    "we get the typical relaxation time for a droplet of size @xmath17 , @xmath28 droplets of length smaller than @xmath17 will not relax at all in this timescale . droplets of length larger than @xmath17 relax by combinations of moves over lengthscales of the order of @xmath17 in times of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "hence , @xmath29 gives the typical rate of rearrangements in the system @xcite .",
    "the bb procedure outlined in the previous subsection is extremely general . however , analysing the partition function of any model in sufficient detail to evaluate the length @xmath17 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ equ : mos_len ] ) , is rather difficult . in the rest of this work",
    "we apply the procedure to two models of ising spins with plaquette interactions in two dimensions .",
    "we will define the models in the next section , but we first make some introductory remarks .",
    "the first model is the square plaquette model ( spm ) , in which spins are defined on a square lattice , and interactions involve the quartets of spins that form the square plaquettes of the lattice @xcite . in the second model ,",
    "the spins occupy the sites of a triangular lattice , and interactions are between triplets of spins on upward pointing triangular plaquettes @xcite .",
    "we refer to it as the triangular plaquette model ( tpm ) .",
    "both models have dual representations @xcite : in a spin representation they describe interacting spins with simple dynamical rules ( single spin - flips ) ; in a `` defect '' representation they describe thermodynamically independent excitations with more complicated dynamical rules . in this latter description they resemble the kinetically constrained models advocated as effective models for the glass transition in the dynamic facilitation approach @xcite . in this sense , they interpolate between models with microscopic degrees of freedom , and more phenomenological models of `` mobility fields '' .",
    "the spm and tpm have trivial thermodynamics : the excitations in the models are localized and statically non - interacting , so the only thermodynamic singularity is at zero temperature . in terms of our assumption ( i ) , above , this means that we must have @xmath30 .",
    "it also has implications on the assumptions of ( ii ) and ( iii ) about the surface tension and barrier exponents @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "below we show that the bb procedure can still be applied to extract caging lengthscales from finite - size static properties .",
    "however , while relaxation times grow with growing mosaic lengths , the quantitative dependence of assumption ( iii ) does not hold in the spm and tpm , and these relations need to be generalized .",
    "the spm is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are ising spins , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 indicates position on a square lattice .",
    "the dynamical moves are single spin - flips with glauber rates .",
    "if we write @xmath35 then the partition function is simply a sum over the non - interacting variables @xmath36 ( up to a non - extensive set of constraints on the @xmath36 from the boundary conditions on the spins ) .",
    "the variables @xmath36 are defined on the plaquettes of the square lattice , which forms a dual square lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plaq_sketch ] . plaquettes with @xmath37 cost an energy of unity , and are sparse at low temperatures : we refer to them as defects .",
    "the plaquette model has activated dynamics at low temperatures .",
    "that is , there are very few ( if any ) possible transitions out of a typical state into states with lower energy .",
    "thus , low temperature states are very close to inherent structures ( on quenching to zero temperature , a few local relaxations will take place , quickly leading to a state with no available transitions ) .",
    "thus it is an ideal model to investigate the mosaic hypothesis : there are many metastable states , and these can be easily identified .",
    "( in contrast , the statistics of the free energy minima of an atomistic liquid or a spin glass are much harder to probe ) .",
    "the trivial bulk thermodynamics of the spm are affected by freezing the boundary spins of a finite droplet .",
    "consider the partition function of a finite system of @xmath38 spins ( assumed square for convenience ) , with @xmath39 frozen spins along the boundary .",
    "the state of the system is then defined by the configuration of the @xmath40 remaining ( bulk ) spins , and its energy is given by ( half of ) the sum of the @xmath41 defect variables , @xmath36 .",
    "we see immediately that there are more configurations of the plaquettes than of the bulk spins : a partition sum over the bulk spins does not contain all configurations of the plaquette variables .",
    "rather , there are @xmath42 constraints on the possible arrangements of the defects .    to understand the origin of these constraints , observe that flipping any of the @xmath40 free spins preserves the parity of the number of defects in any row or column of the square ( dual ) lattice .",
    "therefore the @xmath43 constraints select the parity of the @xmath44 rows and @xmath44 columns of the dual lattice .",
    "[ fixing the parities of all the rows sets the parity of the total number of defects .",
    "thus there are only @xmath45 independent column parities , the final one being fixed by the parity of the total number of defects .",

    "these arguments are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq_bulk_boundary ] .",
    "if we separate the energy of a configuration into a part coming from the @xmath46 plaquettes in the bulk , and the @xmath47 plaquettes along the boundary then we may write the partition function for all @xmath38 spins as @xmath48 where @xmath4 labels the configuration of the bulk spins and @xmath5 that of the boundary .",
    "the integer @xmath49 is the number of bulk plaquettes that are excited , and @xmath50 is the number of boundary plaquettes that are excited . making contact with section  [ sec : bb ]",
    ", we identify @xmath49 with the free energy @xmath8 and @xmath50 with the surface energy @xmath51 .",
    "note that we have replaced the sum in ( [ equ : mos_len ] ) over inherent structures by a sum over states , since the typical droplets under consideration can not reduce their energy by any single spin - flip .",
    "the partition function in ( [ equ : zia ] ) can be written in terms of partial sums over boundary conditions @xmath5 , @xmath52 now imagine choosing a droplet in an infinite system . in doing",
    "so we find that its boundary state is @xmath5 .",
    "the droplet lengthscale is calculated by considering the contribution of that droplet to @xmath53 .",
    "in other words , we need to estimate the expectation value of @xmath54 as a function of droplet size .",
    "this expectation value is @xmath55 the second form for the expression above emphasises that it is an average over the boundary conditions with their thermal weights , @xmath53 .",

    "the entropy ( [ equ : droplet_entropy ] ) measures the typical number of states contributing to the partition sum with a fixed boundary .",

    ", the boundary conditions on the spins constrain the parity of the number of defects in each row and column of the dual lattice . if the number of rows with odd parity is @xmath62 and the number of columns with odd parity is @xmath63 , then @xmath53 depends on the boundary conditions only through @xmath62 and @xmath63 . since it is a symmetric function of these two integers ,",

    "note that @xmath66 is always even since @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( and therefore @xmath67 ) all have the parity of the total number of defects in the droplet .",
    "it is also convenient to parameterize temperature by : @xmath68 which is related to the average concentration of excitations by @xmath69 , the last approximate equality being valid at low temperatures .",
    "the low temperature behaviour of the plaquette model obeys scaling relations @xcite .",
    "length and timescales diverge at low temperatures as simple powers of @xmath70 .",
    "we therefore work in the scaling regime , at leading order in @xmath70 . in terms of droplet sizes",

    "the relevant indicators of droplet size will be @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "that is , we assume @xmath74 , but make no assumption on the absolute sizes of @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "we begin by considering fixed @xmath71 and very low temperatures : @xmath75 . on picking a droplet from an infinite system ,",
    "it is very likely that it contains no defects .",
    "the boundaries will then be such that all rows and columns contain even numbers of defects .",
    "there are @xmath76 such boundary conditions ( one for each choice of spins , say , in the bottom and leftmost sides of the box ) .",

    "further , simple counting arguments show that excited states contain even numbers of defects @xmath80 .",
    "their boltzmann weights are @xmath81 and the degeneracy of the state with @xmath82 defects is proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "this means that : @xmath84 this partition function is also relevant to periodic boundary conditions , and is the one calculated in @xcite . in fig .",

    "[ fig : pbc_entropy ] shows that the droplet has an `` entropy crisis '' at @xmath86 . in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "we must consider @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "[ fig : entropy_c ]    the behaviour of droplets changes qualitatively in the case of ground states containing two or more defects . as is clear from fig .",

    "thus , as soon as droplets with @xmath97 dominate @xmath7 then the they are thermodynamically melted according to condition ( [ equ : mos_len_z ] ) .",

    "[ fig : entropy_c ] where we average the exact results for the entropy at given @xmath67 and @xmath66 over a distribution of @xmath113 that is sampled by monte carlo .",

    "that is , the boundary condition requires @xmath67 rows to have odd numbers of defects in them , and it also requires @xmath67 columns to have the same property .",

    "these observations for the overlaps are consistent with thermodynamic melting of the droplet at @xmath126 found above .",
    "we have established that the melting lengthscale @xmath127 scales as @xmath128 in the spm , but that there is also a second important thermodynamic crossover at @xmath129 .",
    "we now compare the results so far with the expectations of bb .",
    "the appearance of two lengthscales was not anticipated in @xcite .",

    "the assumption of bb is that the lengthscale defined by ( [ equ : mos_len_typ ] ) will scale in a similar way .",
    "( [ equ : mos_len ] ) treats all states individually , whereas ( [ equ : mos_len_typ ] ) assumes that we can extrapolate the properties of the partition sum from typical states at the relevant temperature .",
    "we write the mosaic lengthscale extracted from ( [ equ : mos_len_typ ] ) as @xmath132 : we find that @xmath17 and @xmath132 do not coincide in the spm .",
    "more precisely , the average bulk energy of a droplet at a given temperature is @xmath133 , and the configurational entropy at that temperature is @xmath134 .",
    "if we replace the bulk of the droplet by a new bulk state with the same energy , then the typical boundary energy is @xmath135 ( half of the boundary plaquettes will be excited , since there are no two - point spin correlations either in the bulk or along the boundary ) .",
    "so from eq .",
    "( [ equ : mos_len_typ ] ) , we have @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138    on the other hand , we showed in the previous section that the eq .",

    "can then be approximated to give a form resembling eq .",
    "( [ equ : mos_len_typ ] ) , but that term is irrelevant to droplet melting in the spm since the second term dominates the partition sum for @xmath124 .",
    "we interpret this result as evidence that approximations such as those leading to eq .",
    "( [ equ : mos_len_typ ] ) are rather dangerous . in general , systems may possess significant numbers of states in the partition sum with smaller than average boundary energy , and these may be sufficient to destroy spin correlations in the infinite time limit ( @xmath144 when @xmath145 ) , even if the droplet is exploring only a small fraction of its metastable states .",
    "further , we will show in the next section that if the droplet does melt in stages then choosing whether to identify the bulk relaxation time as @xmath146 or @xmath147 requires investigation of the specific system under study . in the spm",
    ", we will find that while complete destruction of of spin correlations at large times does take place for @xmath145 , the timescale for this relaxation is much longer than the bulk relaxation time .",
    "however , this effect can not be inferred from thermodynamic arguments : it is a kinetic effect .    to end this discussion",
    ", we note that while the condition @xmath148 leads to rather small droplets , the configurational entropy of a droplet of this size is @xmath149 .",

    "thus we see that despite the condition that frozen droplets contain at most one defect , the freezing lengthscale is still much larger than its trivial lower bound .",
    "in this subsection we consider the relaxation of the droplets studied thermodynamically above .",

    "( [ equ : c0_replica ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : replica_correl ] ] we expect the long time limit of this function to approach zero even for @xmath124 , although this is hard to show in simulations since simulations with large numbers of defects at small temperatures are very computationally expensive .",
    "moving towards the regime with @xmath104 , we see that the relaxation of the system is very slow , and that there are large correlations that persist to the infinite time limit : see fig .",

    "we can make a link between static and dynamic quantities by evaluation of the long time limit of these functions using the high temperature series ( cf .",
    "[ fig : replica_correl ] ) .",
    "thus we have shown how the two lengthscales associated with the glassy mosaic state affect the dynamics of the system .",
    "as the temperature is reduced , the relaxation slows for @xmath103 , before stopping completely at @xmath130 .",
    "the separation of these lengthscales was not anticipated in @xcite : we have more to say on this below .    before ending our discussion of dynamics ,",
    "we make two further points .",
    "firstly , we note that it is clear from ref .",
    "@xcite that the bulk relaxation is caused by correlated motion of defects over distances @xmath157 .",
    "this coincides with the system size above which the system relaxes as the bulk .",
    "secondly , it is also known @xcite that correlated motion for defects over a distance @xmath158 takes place on a timescale @xmath159",
    "so we see that the analogue for equation ( [ equ : tau_psi ] ) is @xmath160 the exponent depends logarithmically on @xmath1 with a prefactor that does not depend on temperature : apart from the constant activation energy , the free energy barriers to motion are purely entropic in origin .",
    "the entropic nature of the barriers explains why relaxation of the spm model diverges only in an arrhenius fashion ( @xmath161 ) despite the co - operativity of its dynamics .",
    "it is clear from the results of this section that , even in a simple model like the spm , the situation regarding caging and mosaic lengthscales is already more complicated than what the appealingly simple and general arguments of @xcite would predict . as we increase the size of droplets with frozen boundaries , there are two crossovers .",
    "static spin - spin correlations vanish at at @xmath162 , but neither the droplet entropy , nor its dynamical correlation functions reach their bulk forms until the much higher temperature @xmath163 . we note that these two lengthscales were also identified in the discussion of static and dynamic lengthscales in ref .  @xcite .",
    "to be precise , the static four - spin correlator @xmath164 decays on a lengthscale @xmath165 , but the dynamic four point correlator decays on a length that scales as @xmath166 .",
    "there is also a static lengthscale that mirrors the scaling of @xmath167 which is derived from fluctuations of two point correlations @xcite .    despite these complications ,",
    "a general picture like that of @xcite does seem to be applicable to the spm , in the sense that droplet melting does occur , even if it happens in stages .",
    "as the temperature decreases towards the kauzmann singularity at @xmath168 , the mosaic lengthscale increases , and the relaxation time increases according to ( [ equ : pq_tau_xi ] ) .",
    "this increase follows a simple arrhenius law because only the entropic barriers depend on @xmath17 .",
    "this suggests that one should replace ( [ equ : tau_psi ] ) by the more general parametrization @xmath169 where @xmath170 describes the entropic part of the barrier and @xmath171 the energetic part . at small temperatures",
    "then we expect the energetic part to dominate , except in the case where @xmath171 is independent of @xmath1 , as is the case for the spm .",
    "it is at this point at which our discussion of dynamics diverges from that of ktw and bb : since the ( non - perturbative ) dynamical moves are not nucleation events in this model , then the free energy barrier is not set by a transition state with a critical droplet of the new phase .",
    "rather , the relaxation proceeds by less expensive rearrangements that occur over a lengthscale @xmath132 , as was discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section we compare the results we found above for the spm , with a similar model of ising spins : the triangular plaquette model , or tpm @xcite .",
    "this model has a super - arrhenius divergence of the relaxation time at low temperatures , and is therefore a fragile model , as compared to the spm , which is strong .",
    "moreover , dynamical correlations do not have the strong anisotropy of the spm @xcite . the calculation of the partition function , however , is considerably more involved , so our results below are less detailed than those for the spm .",
    "the tpm is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath172 where as before @xmath32 are ising spins on a square lattice and the dynamics are is spin - flips with glauber rates .",
    "if we define the plaquette variables @xmath173 we again find that the partition sum over the spins reduces to a product over @xmath174 , that are independent up to a non - extensive set of constraints from the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we note that defining this model in this way leads to a hamiltonian that does not possess the square symmetry group of the lattice : it is more intuitive to deform the square lattice into a triangular one .",
    "the interactions are then around upward pointing triangular plaquettes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rhomb ] ) .",
    "the symmetries of the hamiltonian are then translations by lattice vectors , and @xmath175 rotations ( @xmath176 rotations leave the lattice invariant but flip downward pointing triangles to upward pointing ones , so they change the hamiltonian ) .    the analogy of the square droplet of fig .",
    "[ fig : plaq_sketch ] is a rhombus shape in the triangular representation .",
    "the arguments for counting bulk and boundary states are the same as those of the plaquette model .",
    "however , identifying the @xmath76 degeneracies of each state and the nature of the @xmath177 constraints is considerably more involved .",
    "the key to understanding static properties of the triangular plaquette model is to realise that @xmath178^n .\\ ] ] all multi - spin correlators that can be written in this form are finite .",
    "further , all other multi - spin correlators are zero @xcite .",
    "while one and two point static spin correlations vanish , @xmath179 specific three point correlators are non - zero ,",
    "@xmath180    a useful general relation is that @xmath181 where the @xmath182 $ ] are binomial coefficients .",
    "since the @xmath183 s and the @xmath184 s are ising variables , only the parities of the binomial coefficients are relevant . in terms of correlation functions",
    ", this relation implies that there is a finite multi - spin correlator connecting @xmath185 and various spins in row @xmath186 of the lattice .",
    "this correlator is related to the first @xmath187 rows of pascal s triangle ( pt ) .",
    "the correlator connects the spins corresponding to entries of the @xmath187th row of the pt that have odd parity .",
    "its value is given by @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the number of entries in the first @xmath190 rows of the pt that have odd parity .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : st ] and the associated caption . now , the typical number of odd entries in a pascal s triangle of linear size @xmath158 is @xmath191 with @xmath192 .",

    "furthermore , fixing the boundary spins imposes @xmath177 constraints on the allowed configurations of the plaquette variables .",
    "the form of these symmetries and constraints are given explicitly in appendix  [ app : triag_constraints ] .",
    "the spm was simple to analyse since the constraints are in a form where each plaquette appears in exactly two constraints . in that case",
    "we can make a geometrical interpretation of those constraints . in the tpm",
    "the consequences of imposing the constraints is less clear .",
    "we therefore proceed directly to a discussion of dynamic properties , in an attempt to access the static properties indirectly .",
    "relaxation in the tpm is frustrated by a hierarchy of energy barriers@xcite : co - operative motion over a distance @xmath1 requires the crossing of an energy barrier of a height @xmath196 .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the east model @xcite .    in order to understand the scaling of the mosaic length",
    ", we investigate the scaling of @xmath197 in finite droplets : see figure  [ fig : triag_ct_small ] .",
    "a lower bound on the freezing lengthscale is set by the elementary condition @xmath198 , since all states with single defects have different boundary conditions .",
    "this would imply that the long time limit of the autocorrelation , @xmath123 should be a scaling function of @xmath108 , as in the spm , fig .",
    "[ fig : replica_correl ] .",
    "however , from the discussions of static correlations above , it is clear that the physics of the triangular plaquette model is intrinsically related to the parities of binomial co - efficients , and hence to sierpinski s triangle .",
    "as mentioned above , this structure has a fractal dimension of @xmath199 . in fig.[fig : triag_ct_scaling ] we show relaxation data at various temperatures with constant values of @xmath200 .",
    "we see that @xmath123 does seem to depend only on this combination .",
    "the conclusion is that the mosaic lengthscale scales as @xmath201 this relation indicates that typical droplets melt when they contain of the order of @xmath202 defects ; below this number there no co - operative mechanisms allowing the droplet to rearrange .",
    "this should be compared with the spm , in which droplets with @xmath203 contain of the order of one defect , but those at the dynamical crossover ( @xmath204 ) contain of the order of @xmath205 defects .",
    "an alternative measure of the co - operativity of the dynamics is given by the bulk `` four - point '' correlation function ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath206 this correlation function measures spatial correlations in the single site autocorrelation function .",
    "it is convenient here to work with the connected part of this function , normalised according to @xmath207 in the triangular plaquette model , the function @xmath208 has a complicated spatio - temporal structure , again related to sierpinski s triangle : we postpone a detailed discussion of this structure to a later work .",
    "however , the circular average of this function , which we denote by @xmath209 decays smoothly with distance ( at a fixed time ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triag_g4_scaling ] , from which it is clear that the lengthscale over which dynamical correlations occur also scales as @xmath210    we have used the dynamics of finite droplets to identify a single mosaic lengthscale in the triangular plaquette model , that scales as @xmath211 .",
    "further , we know @xcite that energy barriers to motion over a lengthscale @xmath158 require an activation energy of the order of @xmath212 .",
    "at very low temperatures , we therefore expect the bulk relaxation time at very low temperatures to scale as @xmath213 note that ref .",

    "( [ equ : tau_barriers ] ) .",
    "the fit in the figure is consistent with ( [ equ : triag_logtau ] ) , although the range of @xmath217 that we consider is too small to confirm it beyond doubt .",
    "the thermodynamics of finite droplets in the triangular plaquette model are not sufficiently simple to allow an analysis of the droplet entropy and hence determination of the mosaic lengthscale according to the criterion ( [ equ : mos_len ] ) .",
    "however , it appears that the long time limit of the single spin autocorrelation function approaches unity as @xmath218 gets small .",
    "if @xmath123 approaches unity then it seems reasonable to assume that droplets are effectively trapped in a single state that dominates the partition sum , and that this should be an equivalent criterion to ( [ equ : mos_len ] ) .",
    "we find that the mosaic lengthscale extracted in this way ( @xmath17 ) , scales in the same way as the static lengthscale for multi - spin correlations ( @xmath219 ) , and as the dynamical lengthscale extracted from the four point correlator ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "this scaling is evidence for the presence of a single lengthscale in this model .",
    "this is in contrast to the tpm , and more in line with @xcite .    on the relation of dynamics to statics",
    ", the analogue of ( [ equ : tau_psi ] ) seems to be @xmath221 the increase of the energy barriers with @xmath1 is again slower than the power law predicted by @xcite , but the assumption of an increasing function is robust .",

    "we have successfully applied the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite to two simple models of interacting ising spins .",
    "we find that the concept of `` caging '' whereby the states of individual spins are strongly constrained by frozen spins surrounding them applies well in these models .",
    "we were able to study the breakdown of this caging effect by considering droplets of increasing size .",
    "in the square plaquette model ( spm ) , the caging breaks down in two stages as the droplet size increases . for @xmath222",
    "the droplet is frozen .",
    "for @xmath223 the droplet will eventually relax , but this relaxation is slower than that of the bulk system . finally , for @xmath224 the relaxation time coincides with that of the bulk .",
    "the correlation lengths controlling these two crossovers have the same scalings as the two separate lengths identified in this model from four point static and dynamic correlations@xcite .",
    "the two stage droplet melting in this model is more complicated than the simple scenario of bb .",
    "interestingly , the two crossover temperatures of the spm , as well as the structure of the droplet states in the intermediate regime , bear some resemblance with the situation in mean - field systems like the @xmath189-spin model ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in the triangular plaquette model ( tpm )",
    "we find only a single crossover in the system at @xmath225 .",
    "this is more in line with the situation anticipated in bb .",
    "the same lengthscale is again present in static multi - spin correlation functions , and in four - point dynamical correlators .",
    "we draw two conclusions from these results .",
    "firstly , we are able to verify that the procedure of bb is a suitable way to identify a mosaic lengthscale . in the general case",
    "it may be difficult to test the criterion ( [ equ : mos_len ] ) directly , although it is possible in the spm . in less favourable situations , it is still possible to use dynamical studies to extract the mosaic lengthscale , as we showed for the tpm .",
    "secondly , we have shown that models without a finite temperature phase transition can still be described from the mosaic perspective of ktw and bb .",
    "this indicates that the concept of a glassy mosaic state is more general than the specific picture of ktw .",
    "while the low temperature states of the plaquette models are constructed by tiling the plane with different metastable configurations of the spin system , there are no well - defined droplets or domain walls in these states . rather , there are point - like defects that allow the system to interpolate smoothly between different metastable configurations .",
    "the crucial difference with the ktw approach is that , while dynamics does proceed by non - perturbative events that require co - operation over a lengthscale that diverges at low temperatures , these events are not related to nucleation , but to more efficient rearrangements of the point - like defects .    in summary , typical states in the plaquette models",
    "are glassy mosaics whose dynamics should be understood in terms of point defects with co - operative dynamical rules .",
    "these defects are not locally conserved , and are not related to any concept of free volume .",
    "rather , they represent regions in which the free energy barriers to motion are smaller than average . in this approach , the `` activated processes '' that dominate glassy @xmath5-relaxation involve co - operative rearrangements of defects over a lengthscale @xmath1 .",
    "the time scales for these processes increase with @xmath1 , with a general relation similar to  ( [ equ : tau_barriers ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this work has been to investigate rather general arguments of ktw and bb explicitly in specific , and rather simple , finite dimensional models .",
    "we find good evidence for a generalised caging effect , but our view of static and dynamic properties of the glassy mosaic is qualitatively different from that of ktw . the possible links between spatial variation in the mosaic length and dynamical heterogeneity remain as an area for further study .",
    "we thank g. biroli and d. sherrington for discussions .",
    "this work was supported by epsrc grants no .",
    "gr / r83712/01 and gr / s54074/01 , and university of nottingham grant no .",
    "we follow @xcite in making a high temperature expansion for the square plaquette model . the partition function for a droplet of size @xmath71 with fixed boundary spins is @xmath226 with @xmath227 as above .",
    "since the @xmath36 are ising variables then this can be written @xmath228 where @xmath229 .",
    "expanding the product results in a power series in @xmath230 : there are @xmath231 terms corresponding to states of a dual system where the spins are the @xmath36 .",
    "each state is equal to a power of @xmath230 multiplied by a combination of the @xmath185 ; the term vanishes on summation over the @xmath185 if it contains any spin to an odd power .",
    "otherwise , the coefficient of the power of @xmath230 depends only on boundary spins : in that case , the sum over bulk spins just contributes a trivial factor @xmath232 .",
    "terms containing bulk spins to even powers are formed by flipping whole rows and columns of the dual @xmath36 variables .",
    "the result is that @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath235 ; @xmath236 means the @xmath36 in row @xmath237 have been flipped .",
    "we note that the boundary spins enter only through combinations such as @xmath238 , which gives the parity of the number of defects in the @xmath237th row of the dual lattice .",
    "further , the terms in the sum depend on only four numbers : @xmath239 ; @xmath240 ; the number of rows for which @xmath236 and @xmath241 ; and the number of columns for which @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the number of rows for which @xmath241 and @xmath63 be the equivalent number of columns .",
    "then we can write @xmath244 with @xmath245 where now @xmath246 and @xmath247 since @xmath248 and @xmath249 are the number of rows with @xmath250 and odd and even defect parities respectively , and @xmath251 and @xmath252 are similar numbers of columns .",
    "we denote the binomial coefficients by @xmath253    we may now sum over @xmath251 and @xmath252 , yielding @xmath254 with @xmath255    a similar procedure leads to the expression for the expectation value of any spin , given a boundary condition .",
    "we state only the result which depends on the coordinates of the spin @xmath256 , as well as the total numbers of rows and columns with odd defect parity : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it also depends on @xmath257 , the number of such rows with @xmath237 co - ordinate less than @xmath21 and @xmath258 : the number of such columns with @xmath259 co - ordinate less than @xmath4 .",
    "( clearly @xmath260 and @xmath261 ) .",
    "the result is that @xmath262 where @xmath263 with @xmath264    these results are still a little cumbersome , but they are exact , and are can be evaluated computationally .",
    "the number of terms in the sum may be as large as @xmath265 , but this is polynomial rather than exponential in the system size .",
    "here we make some comments about the thermodynamics of finite ( @xmath266 ) droplets in the triangular plaquette model .",
    "we first identify the @xmath76 transformations that leave the droplet energy unchanged .",
    "recall that @xmath267 it follows that if we specify the boundary spins @xmath268 and @xmath269 ( where @xmath270 ) then the rest of the spins are determined by the set @xmath271 ( with @xmath272 ) .",
    "thus , the required degenerate states for a given choice of the @xmath271 can be generated by cycling through the possible states of these two boundaries .    to identify the constraints on the plaquette variables arising from the boundary conditions , observe that for a ground state ( @xmath273 ) with specified spins along two boundaries ( @xmath274 ) then the state of the remaining boundary spins are @xmath275 where @xmath276 is equal to unity unless @xmath277 and @xmath278 is odd , in which case it takes the value @xmath279 .",
    "multiplying both sides of each constraint by the appropriate @xmath282 leaves an equality between a product of boundary spins and a product of plaquette variable .",
    "these are the @xmath43 constraints that determine which configurations of the excited plaquettes are present in the partition sum .    while these expressions appear complicated , for a given droplet boundary condition they are simply constraints of the form @xmath283 where the constrained plaquettes form parts of sierpinski triangles . for example , for @xmath284 , the constraint coming from the boundary spin @xmath285 is @xmath286 in the spm the constraints were of the form @xmath287 the simplicity of ( [ equ : app_pq_constraint ] ) in the spm , as compared to ( [ equ : app_triag_constraint ] ) , is the reason for the relative intractability of the partition function of the tpm .      for reviews on the glass transition",
