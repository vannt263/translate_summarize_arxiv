    "fk comae is an ultra - fast rotating ( @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ) , single yellow giant , thought to be a recent w  ursa majoris binary merger ( see eggen & iben 1989 , and references to previous work therein ) .",
    "the star is heavily `` spotted '' ( see strassmeier [ 2009 ] review of starspots ) , leading to extraordinary levels of uv and x - ray emissions , and proclivity to flare regularly at high energies .",
    "not surprisingly , then , fk  com has a long history of attention at optical , ultraviolet , and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "its high - energy characteristics rank fk  com a coronal powerhouse on par with the most extreme of the better known activity heavyweights : short - period rs canum venaticorum binaries ( e.g. , walter et al .  1980 ) .",
    "but , as a single object , fk  com has clear advantages as a laboratory for exploring the outer limits of magnetospheric activity among the coronal late - type stars .",
    "the present paper introduces cocoa - pufs ( * co*ordinated * c*ampaign of * o*bservations and * a*nalysis , * p*hotosphere to * u*pper atmosphere , of a * f*ast - rotating * s*tar ) , a project to conduct intensive , contemporaneous , multi - wavelength measurements of fk  com over several rotational cycles .",
    "the initial section outlines the observational strategy and how it was carried out .",
    "subsequent sections summarize preliminary results , focusing mainly on variability of uv lines , broad - band coronal x - rays , and the visible photometry .",
    "future papers will describe the optical supporting observations in more detail , including surface spot models and magnetic maps derived by zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi : e.g. , semel 1989 ) ; consider the uv and x - ray line spectra in greater depth ; and present theoretical magnetospheric simulations to help better understand the extraordinary properties of this ultra - fast spinning yellow giant .    in the cocoa - pufs study , the photometric ephemeris of jetsu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) was adopted : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the photometric cycle number , and phase 0.0 was the photometric minimum in the original epoch .",
    "( in what follows , @xmath6 is used interchangeably as `` cycle number '' and `` folded phase , '' guided by the context . ) also , in subsequent diagrams and tables , the photometric cycles are defined relative to cycle  6841 in the jetsu et al .",
    "ephemeris , which corresponds roughly to the beginning of the main program of joint _",
    "hst / chandra _ observations during 2011  april 2129 .",
    "appendix a is a glossary of selected abbreviations used in the text .",
    "all laboratory wavelengths @xmath7    are quoted in vacuum .",
    "the photometric and spectropolarimetric properties of fk  com in the visible have been described in numerous previous publications ( see vida et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) , so only the high - energy face of the yellow giant will be summarized here .    in the uv , fk  com",
    "was well observed by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) in the 1980 s and 1990 s , at low resolution ( @xmath8   ) in the fuv , and moderate echelle resolution in the nuv ( @xmath9  km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "sanad & bobrowsky ( 2014 ) published integrated flux measurements from the archival _ iue _ material , and some of the _ hst _ cos pointings described here .",
    "their conclusions were limited to assessments of the temporal variability , typically factors of a few and generally increasing with ionization temperature ( e.g. , from to : @xmath10@xmath11  k ) , qualitatively matching the behavior of the large body of previous ground - based h@xmath12 measurements .    a relatively short ( 13  kilosecond [ ks ] ) pointing on fk  com in 2004 by the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) discovered ultra - broad , highly redshifted profiles of 977    and 1031  +1037    ( @xmath13@xmath14  k ) ( ayres et al .",
    "unfortunately , the singular observation could not be repeated , owing to subsequent degradation of the satellite s attitude - control system .",
    "further , the fuv spectra were taken just a few months before _",
    "hubble s _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) suffered an electrical failure in 2004 , so at the time there was no opportunity to turn the more powerful gaze of stis on the remarkable yellow giant .",
    "prior to cocoa - pufs , fk  com had been recorded at least once by all the major x - ray observatories , including _",
    "( welty & ramsey 1994 ) , _ asca _ ( huenemoerder 1996 ) , _ xmm - newton _",
    "( gondoin et al .  2002 ) , and _",
    "chandra _",
    "hetgs ( drake et al .  2008 ) . in all cases ,",
    "fk  com not only displayed a high coronal x - ray luminosity ( @xmath15 erg s@xmath4 ; about @xmath16 ) , but also episodes of flaring on top of the already substantial quiescent level , typically factors of several .",
    "in the hetgs study , there even were hints of doppler shifted @xmath17  kev fe l - shell lines , although the resolving power was not sufficient to definitively measure excess broadening in the @xmath18  mk coronal features .",
    "figure  1 places fk  comae in the context of other active single f  k giants .",
    "the diagram compares the coronal soft x - ray emission ( 0.22  kev ) against the integrated intensity of the subcoronal 1400    doublet ( @xmath19  k ) for a sample of early - f to early - k giants taken from ayres et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ayres et al .",
    "( is preferred over [ usually brighter ] for such flux - flux diagrams of giants , because the carbon abundance can be affected by deep mixing in evolved stars . )",
    "the figure is adapted from fig .  2 of the first study , adding several stars from the second , and with some updates to the x - ray and fuv fluxes based on more recent archival material ( including the _ chandra _ and _ hst _ measurements of fk  com described later ) .",
    "the yellow wedge approximates the power - law correlations traced by g and k main sequence stars , with the warmer dwarfs along the lower edge , cooler dwarfs along the upper edge , more active stars to the upper right , and low - activity objects to the lower left .",
    "in addition to `` fk '' for fk  com , the sun symbol refers to an average over the past two solar cycles ( based on uv and xuv irradiances from the lisird database ) ; `` ek '' refers to the hyper - active young solar analog ek  draconis ( g2  v ) from ayres ( 2015a ) ; `` a '' and  b  refer to averages of lower activity @xmath12  centauri a ( g2  v ) and b ( k1  v ) from ayres ( 2015b ) ; and `` 24 '' is for the yellow giant 24  ursa majoris ( g4  iii - iv according to cenarro et al .",
    "2009 ) , similar in physical properties to fk  com ( except rotation ) and utilized later as a spectral comparison .",
    "the exact positions of the points are not important , but rather the fact that the cooler giants ( g1k0 ) tend to cluster along the same relationship obeyed by the cooler dwarfs , whereas the warmer yellow giants ( f0g0 ) tend to fall below the ms g - dwarf trend into an `` x - ray - deficient '' zone ( blue oval ) , although there are a few exceptions that might represent transitions from the x - ray - deficient locus to the cool giant zone ( noting that the yellow giants quickly evolve into cooler objects during their rapid transit of the hertzsprung gap : ayres et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "fk  com sits in the upper right corner of the diagram , in a region normally reserved for the extremely active , short - period , tidally - synchronized binaries of the rs  cvn class mentioned earlier .",
    "note , however , that fk  com falls away from a simple extrapolation of the active cool giant locus , and instead seems to lie on a continuation of the x - ray - deficient trend .",
    "such behavior among the most active objects often signals a `` saturation '' of their coronal x - rays with respect to subcoronal species like and ( e.g. , vilhu & rucinski 1983 ) . aside from that detail",
    ", the comparison emphasizes the exceptional high - energy status of the ultra - fast spinning yellow giant .",
    "-7 mm      the dynamic optical hydrogen emissions of fk  com recorded from the ground , and the high degree of temporal variability observed in the uv and x - rays from space , were strong motivations to carry out a focused campaign of coordinated multi - wavelength photometry and spectroscopy on this unusual yellow giant , hence cocoa - pufs .",
    "the top - level objectives of the campaign were to : ( 1 ) catalog  in the visible , uv , and x - rays  high - energy surface features on fk  com by means of `` doppler imaging ; '' ( 2 ) determine the relationship of these `` active regions '' to the photospheric magnetic spots ; ( 3 ) measure persistent kinematic properties of the chromospheric and subcoronal line profiles , analogous to the bimodal , dominantly redshifted hot lines of active solar - type stars like ek  dra ; and ( 4 ) record transient variability associated with the surface activity , including any large flare events that serendipitously might be captured during the intensive coordinated multi - facility campaign .",
    "the cocoa - pufs project was a combination of two guest observer programs , one _ hst , _ the other _ chandra ; _ both joint with the other mission .",
    "initially , go-12279 was approved by the _ hst _ telescope allocation committee ( tac ) , awarded 11 _ hst _ orbits and 120  ks of joint _",
    "chandra _ time . in parallel , a large project ( lp )",
    "proposal had been submitted to _",
    "chandra _ to undertake a similar x - ray / uv time - domain study of fk  com , but on the larger scale possible for an lp .",
    "a few weeks after the _ hst _ peer review , and with knowledge of the outcome , the _ chandra _ tac awarded the lp proposal 240  ks of _ chandra _ time and 11 additional joint _ hst _ orbits .",
    "the combination of the two joint programs allowed a more comprehensive observational approach than would have been possible with the original go-12279 , `` king of spin : the movie , '' alone .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "part of the _ chandra _ lp was designated go-12376 .",
    "cocoa - pufs exploited the high sensitivity of _ hst _ cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) , to record kinematically resolved uv spectra of fk  com ; partnered with the powerful high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) of _ chandra , _ to capture a diverse range of hot ( @xmath2  mk ) coronal emissions in the 130    ( 10 - 0.5  kev ) soft x - ray region .",
    "contemporaneous ground - based photometry and zeeman doppler imaging supplied a history of the surface arrangement of the dark , magnetized starspots in the weeks leading up to the main campaign , as well as during and after the joint spacecraft operations . also , about six months prior to the main campaign",
    ", a snapshot fuv spectrum was taken with _",
    "hubble s _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) to assess the ly@xmath12 intensity for cos detector safety reasons .",
    "the advance stis spectrum proved to be crucial later , in a cross - comparison with the cos spectra from the main campaign , for identifying systematic errors in the cos fuv wavelength scales , such as described in the recent stis / cos study of ek  dra ( ayres 2015a ) .",
    "the characteristics and operational capabilities of _ hst _ cos have been detailed in a number of previous publications , especially green et al .  (",

    "_ iue _ low - resolution fuv spectra of fk  com suggested that the ly@xmath12 peak intensity was within a factor of two of the cos local count rate limit , albeit on the low side ; but close enough to warrant further consideration , especially since fk  com was known to flare from time to time .",
    "if ly@xmath12 were ruled in violation of the cos bright limits , there would be unfortunate repercussions : the `` blue '' segment of the cos detector ( side b ) would have to be deactivated when using grating g130 m .",
    "consequently , not only would key ly@xmath12 itself be lost , but also other important diagnostics , such as the resonance doublet at 1240    ( @xmath23  k ) , hottest of the readily accessible features in the fuv .",
    "however , low - resolution _ iue _ could not fully resolve the bright limit issue . given the obvious benefit of having side b activated for the g130 m exposures , it was decided to spend one of the _ hst _ orbits to definitively measure ly@xmath12 with less sensitive stis , well in advance of the main cos campaign . in that way , not only",
    "would the detector concerns be resolved , one way or the other , but also at least one profile of ly@xmath12 would be secured , even if fk  com failed the cos safety check .",
    "a side benefit was that a few sharp interstellar lines ( such as 1302    and 1334   ) would be captured on top of bright fuv chromospheric emissions , and these could be used , given the high precision of the stis wavelengths , to help remove systematic errors in the cos scales .",
    "this initial single - orbit stis visit  1 was carried out 2010",
    "november under program go-12376",
    ". the target was acquired , and centered , using the stis ccd direct imaging mode ( mirvis ) through the nd3 filter .",
    "next , a 60  s exposure was taken with medium - resolution grating g230mb-2836 ( @xmath24 : 27582914   ) and the ccd , through the 52@xmath250.2@xmath26 slit , to record the important chromospheric 2800    resonance doublet . filling out the remaining visibility period , a medium - resolution fuv echelle exposure was taken with e140m-1425 ( @xmath27 : 11501700   ) , through the @xmath280.2@xmath26 `` photometric '' aperture ,",
    "split into a pair of 806  s sub - exposures .",
    "disappointingly , the processed e140 m spectrum revealed that the ly@xmath12 peak emission was too close to the cos screening limit to permit use of g130 m side b.    figure  4 is a schematic view of the stis e140m-1425 observation .",
    "the fuv emission lines of fk  com are unusually broad , mirroring those of the previous _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "for example , the 1335    multiplet normally appears as a clearly resolved pair of components in more slowly rotating yellow giants ( as illustrated later ) , but in fk  com it is a single broad feature .",
    "-10 mm       not only was fk  com over - bright at ly@xmath12 , but it also exceeded safety limits for the normal nuv imaging acquisition ( primary science aperture [ psa ] and mirror - b ) used for moderately faint objects ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "an alternative was the bright object aperture ( boa ) plus mirror - a , a combination that nevertheless was not considered ideal because the boa image is somewhat distorted , and the impact on acquisitions had not yet been fully assessed at the time ( still relatively early in the cos operations ) .",
    "other approaches were investigated , including several types of dispersed light acq / search followed by cross - dispersion ( xd ) and in - dispersion ( d ) peak - ups .",
    "but , the nuv imaging acq was fastest , a key advantage for a campaign involving a large number of short ( 1 orbit ) cos pointings ( for the go-12279 part ) .",
    "it was therefore decided to schedule go-12376 visit  2 to vet the cos acquisition strategy well before the main program , to allow for adjustments if a more conservative approach was merited .",
    "the single orbit test utilized the boa nuv imaging acquisition described earlier , followed by brief exposures with g285m-2676 , g160m-1577 , and g130m-1291 to fill out the orbit .",
    "these were the principal cos grating settings utilized , in various combinations , during the main campaign .",
    "the acquisition and associated test exposures were successful , so no adjustments to the observing scenario were necessary .",
    "all the cos exposures of the main program were taken in time - tag ( t - tag ) mode , which delivers a time - stamped record of photon coordinates that can be processed in a number of ways to provide temporal histories of fluxes and/or line profiles .",

    "the tentative conclusion is that relatively unsaturated ism absorptions in the fk  com fuv spectrum ( stis+_fuse _ ) are from an absorption system at @xmath40  km s@xmath4 , more blueshifted than the dominant interstellar cloud , ngp , in that direction . at the same time , the likely more saturated nuv features might have additional components at lower ( negative ) velocities contributed by the ngp cloud itself , or other substructures , including perhaps circumstellar gas around fk  com itself .",
    "since the @xmath40  km s@xmath4 system is not seen in other , less distant , stars in the fk  com direction ( e.g. , hz43 , 31  com , and gd153 ) , the absorbing gas likely is beyond the 100  pc horizon of the local ism surveys .",
    "it remains , then , to undertake a more direct comparison between the fk  com fuv and nuv spectra to explore whether the apparent @xmath2  km s@xmath4 discrepancy between the stis fuv absorption system and the cos absorption velocity might be a result of saturation effects , pulling the nuv resonance lines redward ; different absorbing structures ( e.g. , interstellar vs.  circumstellar ) ; or systematic errors in the cos nuv wavelengths .",
    "this comparison will be described shortly .      in this introduction to cocoa - pufs ,",
    "the intent is to present top - level results from preliminary analyses of the multi - wavelength observations , to be followed by more detailed dissections of the diverse datasets in future publications .",
    "the following section focuses on the correction of systematic errors in the cos g130 m and g160 m wavelength scales .",
    "that will be followed by a description of the epoch - average fuv spectrum over the eight - day main campaign .",
    "the presentation then moves to time - resolved cos profiles of 1334    and 1393    during the main monitoring period ; and higher time - resolution integrated fluxes of key diagnostic lines during that interval , as a prelude to a comparison with time - resolved soft x - ray fluxes from the contemporaneous _ chandra _ pointings , as well as the ground - based photometric context measurements in the visible .",
    "the main objective of the cos part of cocoa - pufs was to closely follow the dynamical evolution of the fuv emissions of fk  com over several rotational cycles , as was done for ek  dra , although in that instance only part of a rotation was captured ( by design ) . because the narrower chromospheric and higher temperature line profiles of ek  dra were much more stable in velocity than the fk  com counterparts , it was possible to compare the stis reference spectrum directly against the numerous cos fuv emissions in common , to evaluate deviations of the cos wavelengths against the better calibrated stis scales .",
    "the result was an empirical correction , in terms of equivalent velocities , of the form : @xmath117 where , @xmath118 the same zero - point offset , @xmath119  km s@xmath4 , was derived for the three unique grating / segment combinations of the ek  dra program ( same settings as for cocoa - pufs ) .",
    "the @xmath120 coefficients ranged from @xmath1090.11  km s@xmath4 @xmath4 to @xmath1090.05  km s@xmath4 @xmath4 , with @xmath121    for g130m / a , 1400    for g160m / b , and 1640    for g160m / a .",
    "the uniformly negative @xmath120 coefficients signaled systematically increasing _ redshifts _ of the ( uncorrected ) cos spectra , in both independent grating settings , relative to gold - standard stis .    for the ( larger ) collection of more variable fk  com spectra , the following strategy was followed .",
    "first , all the independent cos fuv spectra taken during the main program ( go-12376 visits 3 + 4 and go-12279 visits 111 for g130m-1291 ; go-12376 visits 3 + 4 for g160m-1577 ) were fitted for the apparent absorption velocities of 1302   , 1304   , and 1334    in g130m / a ; 1526    in g160m / b ; and 1670    in g160m / a .",
    "( unfortunately , the two absorptions in the g160 m range were too weak to measure in the reference stis spectrum . )",
    "the model assumed a smooth distribution of the local background intensities with a superimposed sharp gaussian absorption dip .",
    "the basic datasets were the so - called `` x1dsum '' calcos pipeline files , which co - add the individual fp - pos splits into a single spectrum , correcting for detector fixed patterns such as the grid wire shadows .",
    "these observations necessarily average over some level of stellar variability during the partial orbit ( go-12279 : g130 m ; go-12376 : g160 m ) or multi - orbit ( go-12376 : g130 m ) exposures , but the intent was to measure the presumably stationary interstellar absorptions , so the varying background was of little concern .",
    "next , the individual datasets were corrected for the average local velocity shifts and combined to boost s / n .",
    "this master spectrum was re - fitted for the set of reference absorption features , to determine the offsets relative to the assumed @xmath40  km s@xmath4 average velocity of the three prominent ism absorptions captured by stis ( 1302   , 1304   , and 1334   ) .",
    "finally , the coefficients in equation  6 were adjusted to achieve the best match to the individual segment velocities .",
    "because there were only two calibrators for g160 m , one for each detector side , it was assumed that the @xmath122 and @xmath120 parameters were the same for both sides ( this was the case for ek  dra ) .",
    "figure  13 illustrates the fitting procedure schematically .    with the available ,",
    "though limited , calibration material , the best - fit parameters were : @xmath123  km s@xmath4 and @xmath124  km s@xmath4 @xmath4 for g130m / a ; @xmath125  km s@xmath4 and @xmath126  km s@xmath4 @xmath4 for g160m / ba . the values for g160",
    "m are similar to those found for ek  dra , but the g130m / a parameters differ significantly .",
    "especially note that the key @xmath120 gradients are of opposite sign .",
    "this suggests  at least for g130m / a  that the cos velocity distortions are not constant , but rather vary with an unknown secondary parameter .",
    "unfortunately , the primary g130m / a calibrators are located at the blue end of that segment , and there are no useful ism absorptions at the red end .",
    "thus , it can not be verified whether the linear velocity model derived from the blue end is valid 60    away in the 1400    part of g130m / a where the key doublet falls .",
    "accordingly , the velocities derived later should be viewed with that uncertainty in mind ( but see end of  3.4.2 , below ) .",
    "the cross - calibration described in the preceding section paves the way to correct the cos fuv spectra of fk  com into the reference frame of the stis absorption velocity ( @xmath40  km s@xmath4 heliocentric ) . in the absence of evidence to the contrary",
    ", it will be assumed that the five fuv absorptions recorded by cos all are at the same reference velocity , so that the wavelength corrections to the cos g130 m and g160 m scales can be applied as stated .",
    "certainly , the assumption will be most appropriate for the heavily - used g130m / a segment , which has three of the five reference lines , all of which were recorded by stis , with a minimal @xmath127  km s@xmath4 empirical velocity dispersion among them .",
    "there is the possibility , however , that the strongest low - excitation absorptions ",
    "nuv hk  might have added contributions at different velocities , say circumstellar material associated with fk  com itself .",
    "the @xmath128  km s@xmath4 redward displacement of the cos absorption velocity with respect to the stis fuv velocity might be an example of that effect ( or , it might simply be due to a systematic velocity error in the cos nuv setting ) .",
    "one lingering question is the rv of the stellar photosphere , for which there is some disagreement in the existing literature .",
    "this bears on the discussion of doppler shifts of chromospheric and higher temperature species at different phases . to this end ,",
    "a new estimate of the photospheric rv was derived from a series of ten uves high - resolution spectra of fk  com , taken over a period of five days ( two rotations ) just a few days prior to the cocoa - pufs main program .",
    "a cross - correlation was performed against an rv standard of similar type , rotationally broadened to the @xmath34 of the yellow giant , over the region 60506170   , which has relatively isolated absorption features .",
    "the derived rv s ranged from @xmath129  km s@xmath4 to @xmath79  km s@xmath4 , with an average of @xmath130  ( 0.5 )  km s@xmath4 ( parenthetical value is 1s.e . ) .",
    "the dispersion of the velocity measurements is larger than the nominal accuracy of high - precision uves , but not unexpected for a heavily spotted star whose absorption profiles can be distorted by the dark umbrae , and slighted shifted in apparent centroid depending on the disk locations of the spots ( see , especially , the study by huenemoerder et al .  [ 1993 ] , who documented systematic variations of their rv measurements against photometric phase with a semi - amplitude of @xmath32  3 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the uves estimate of the rv of fk  com is on the lower side of the range @xmath44  km s@xmath4 to @xmath131  km s@xmath4 reported in the historical work cited earlier .",
    "the smaller velocity dispersion , nevertheless , puts even more stringent constraints on binary scenarios for fk  com , as outlined by mccarthy & ramsey ( 1984 ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the apparent photospheric rv of fk  com probably is sensitive to the distribution of spots in a given epoch , and thus depends on how the observations are averaged over phase . in any event",
    ", the rv of fk  com in the cocoa - pufs epoch appears to be @xmath2  km s@xmath4 redward of the fuv absorption ( `` ism '' ) velocity measured by stis , but close to the nominal absorption velocity .",
    "finally , low - excitation , optically - thin chromospheric features can be exploited as a possible check on the photospheric rv of fk  com , and the cos velocity correction : such lines in stellar fuv spectra often are used as surrogates for the photospheric rv ( ayres et al .",
    "unfortunately , due to the heavy rotational blending , there are only two suitable candidates in the high - s / n g130m / a range : 1351    and 1411   .",
    "figure  14 illustrates these two features from the cos epoch - average fuv spectrum , shifted into the photospheric rv frame of fk  com as indicated by uves .",
    "the agreement with a broadened version of the rv - corrected 24  uma spectrum is good in both cases , which provides additional confidence in the uves - derived rv , as well as the cos wavelength correction ( especially for 1411   , at the far red end of g130m / a ) .",
    "the agreement also suggests that there are no large differential motions between the low chromosphere and photosphere , which bears on interpretations of the apparent redshifts .",
    "figure  15 is an overview of the epoch - average cos fuv spectrum of fk  com together with comparison yellow giant 24  uma , adjusted to the rv frames of both stars .",
    "the fk  com spectrum is noisier beyond 1415    ( where the g160 m part was spliced in ) owing to the lower exposure in the g160 m segments compared with g130m / a .",
    "nevertheless , the epoch - average cos tracings are much higher in s / n overall than the partial - orbit stis spectrum illustrated in fig .",
    "cos reinforces the view earlier from stis ( and _ fuse _ ) : the fk  com lines are extraordinarily broad , so much so that features normally separated ( e.g. , 1334  +1335   ) now have become strongly blended , which ( as with ) makes it challenging to isolate the individual profile shapes . table  5 lists integrated fluxes of several of the cos blended line complexes , analogous to the stis measurements in table  3 .",

    "this introduction to the cocoa - pufs project lays a foundation for future , more focused , studies that will consider the visible , fuv , and x - ray observations of fk  com in more detail .",
    "these future efforts will include , for example : doppler imaging and zdi maps of the distribution of spotted areas on the stellar surface ; modeling the chromospheric properties necessary to reproduce the apparent rotational profiles of optically thick features like , as well as optically thinner transitions like ; time - resolved profiles of chromospheric and subcoronal during the flaring intervals ; a careful search for so - far elusive [ ] ; and the hetgs spectra and acis - s zeroth - order pulse - height distributions , including emission - measure modeling , compositional changes during flares , and possible doppler effects in the strongest x - ray lines ( individually or collectively : see drake et al .",
    "layered on top of the primarily observational studies , is envisioned a theoretical effort to derive , from the zdi maps and rotational behavior of the various fuv and x - ray diagnostics , a magnetospheric model to capture the extreme coronal conditions on the exceptional yellow giant rotating near breakup ( see , e.g. , cohen et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in the meantime",
    ", the initial foray into cocoa - pufs has several conclusions of its own :    * the chromospheric and subcoronal features of fk  com are exceptionally broad , super - rotationally so ; and exhibit large doppler shifts , especially , which appears to be significantly redshifted in the epoch - average non - flare profile .",
    "the chromospheric features of and also appear to be redshifted in the respective average profiles , although less so than .",
    "there are , however , issues with the appropriate rv to apply to these spectra ; and the influence of the `` missing phases '' ( no observations in phase band @xmath202 ) on the average profiles .",
    "nevertheless , these results help to clarify the singular _ fuse _ observation , which also had recorded large redshifts of , especially , subcoronal .",
    "such shifts now are seen to be mainly due to rotational modulation effects , but likely partly also to an underlying systemic redshift of the hot lines , perhaps analogous to the steady radial downflows recorded in solar counterparts ( e.g. , peter 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "an early interpretation of the solar redshifts attributed the mass flows to spicular material injected into the corona and heated up , then cooling and draining back to the chromosphere below ( pneuman & kopp 1978 ) .",
    "more recent explanations , motivated by 3d mhd simulations , have suggested that episodic energy releases within the chromosphere itself impulsively heat the local gas to coronal temperatures , then the back - reaction to the explosive expansion pushes on the lower atmosphere causing the redshifted emissions at intermediate temperatures ( guerreiro et al .",
    "2013 , and references to previous work therein ) .",
    "the latter scenario places the redshifted sources at relatively low altitudes , in compact magnetic loops .",
    "this mechanism might be less relevant to fk  com , where the super - rotational broadening of the hot lines suggests that the redshifts are occurring much further out .",
    "another solar phenomenon associated with redshifted subcoronal lines , which perhaps is more relevant to flare - dominated fk  com , is the observed ballistic splashdowns associated with back - falling flare material ( reale et al .",
    "* there was no obvious sign of the [ ] 1354    coronal forbidden line in the cos fuv spectra , even during flaring periods .",
    "one of the key objectives of the originally conceived cocoa - pufs was to record doppler widths of this @xmath203  mk feature at cos resolution ( @xmath148  km s@xmath4 versus the @xmath32500  km s@xmath4 achieved , at best , with hetgs for coronal resonance lines ) to gauge whether the hot coronal plasma is as extended as apparently is the cooler chromospheric gas traced by optical h@xmath12 .",
    "it was possible , for example , that the cooler gas is organized in extended solar - like `` prominences , '' confined by high - altitude magnetic loops ( see , e.g. , strassmeier [ 1994 ] for the case of hu  virginis , which exhibited a large - scale chromospheric temperature siphon flow likely confined by a giant flux rope ) , while the multi - million degree coronal plasma is localized closer to the stellar surface in compact high - pressure loop systems .",
    "however , the pilot synthetic spectra that indicated [ ] should be easily detected had not taken into account what now is seen as the over - broadening , well beyond @xmath204 , of the flanking 1351    and 1355    emissions .",
    "these blend together in their red and blue wings , respectively , making detection of intrinsically faint [ ] ( see fig .  15 for 24  uma ) more challenging .",
    "there is hope , nevertheless , that constraints can be placed on the coronal forbidden line width by carefully modeling the chromospheric blending ( e.g. , saar et al .",
    "2014 ) . at the same time",
    ", the apparent super - rotational broadening of indicates that gas at least as hot as @xmath205  k exists far from the star .",
    "it is not unreasonable to imagine that the subcoronal gas was derived from the cooling of even hotter , i.e. , coronal material . in particular",
    ", the systemic redshifts of in the epoch - average profile strongly suggest that the radiating gas is falling back to the surface , which in turn suggests that the gas is well above its normal equilibrium scale height . in order to have achieved the ( higher ) altitude in the first place , the original material must have been much hotter .",
    "this also is true for cool prominences in the solar corona , whose apparent stability belies a continual condensation of hot coronal material into the magnetic saddle region ( see , e.g. , schmit et al .",
    "2013 , and references therein ) .",
    "if the hot corona of fk  com is as extended , or more extended , than indicated by the cooler species , super - rotationally broadened [ ] likely will be difficult to detect .",
    "however , lack of a detection ( based on predicted visibilities derived from hetgs x - ray lines of similar excitation ) also might prove the point .",
    "+ * flares are a common occurrence on fk  com , both ultraviolet and x - ray .",
    "an x - ray enhancement of five times was captured during one of the hetgs pointings , a significant outburst for a star whose normal coronal @xmath206 already is @xmath10 times solar , but not remarkable given the similar scales of high - energy variability seen in previous x - ray observations ( including the earlier hetgs pointing on fk  com in 2000 , described by drake et al .  [",
    "2008 ] , which captured the peak and decay of a similar - size event ) .",
    "the fuv outbursts were smaller , about two times the epoch - average level . in both cases",
    "there is the issue of a relatively limited sampling interval , albeit much more extensive than previous fuv ( e.g. , _ iue _ ) and x - ray efforts ( _ rosat , asca , xmm - newton , chandra _ )",
    ". nevertheless , the specific x - ray and fuv enhancements during the fk  com campaign did not show a strong correlation .",
    "this is somewhat surprising in light of solar experience , where flares tend to affect all the atmospheric temperature regimes together ; or the example of the large fuv flare decay on ek  dra where [ ] ( proxy for soft x - rays ) varied in step with the ( simultaneously observed ) emission .",
    "ayres & france ( 2010 ) suggested that isolated `` flares '' at temperatures might represent catastrophic cooling events in previously hot coronal gas , producing cooling ( down)flows , an `` anti - flare '' if you will .",
    "note , however , that the best subcoronal flare example in the fk  com campaign appears to show significant extra blueshifts in the evolving profiles ( fig .",
    "25c ) , although that still could represent a downflow if the event was above the limb on the far side of the star , but still in the line of sight .",
    "the summary conclusion is that ultra - fast - rotating fk  com is surrounded by an extended region filled by material at least as hot as @xmath207  k , and probably much hotter , although pervaded by high - altitude structures at chromospheric ( @xmath208  k ) temperatures , something like cool prominences on the sun embedded in the hot corona .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion that the previously well observed highly variable optical h@xmath12 emission of fk  com arises in a complex stellar magnetosphere , rooted in the strong fields of the pervasive surface starspots ; rather than in a temporary `` excretion disk '' ejected during the binary merger thought to have created the fast - spinning yellow giant in the first place .",
    "in this view , fk  com is not a unique object , but rather just an extreme example of the more slowly rotating ( but still quite fast ) hertzsprung gap yellow giants ( see ayres et al .",
    "1998 and fig .  1 here ) , which also display super - rotational broadening of their subcoronal lines , as well as [ ] in a few favorable cases ( ayres et al .",
    "2003 ) . at the same time",
    ", the prevalence of redshifts among the chromospheric and subcoronal species raises the possibility that the strongly confining magnetosphere might inhibit mass outflows and associated angular momentum loss .",
    "for example , the magnetosphere could stall the breakout of coronal mass ejections ( cme ) , which normally might carry away significant mass ( and angular momentum ) from the frequently flaring giant .",
    "this notion has support in the theoretical magnetospheric models of a simulated fk  com - like corona described by cohen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which show the development of a strong toroidal field configuration that could suppress equatorial mass loss .",
    "the inhibition of angular momentum loss could postpone what might have been a rather short - lived catastrophic spindown phase , allowing fk - com - like binary mergers to persist longer as fast rotators , and thus be recognized observationally as unique objects .",
    "it also is possible that similar magnetospheric trapping occurs on other hype - ractive stars , and perhaps is the cause of the surprisingly long - lived rapid rotator sequence seen in g and k dwarfs of young clusters ( e.g. , the `` c - branch '' of barnes 2003 )",
    ".    finally , although the initial episode of cocoa - pufs is concluding , the saga is far from over .",
    "the planned more focused examinations of the ground - based , _ hst , _ and _ chandra _ material , and theoretical magnetospheric modeling in parallel , hold great promise for unraveling the details of late - type activity at its outer limits .",

    "<S> cocoa - pufs is an energy - diverse , time - domain study of the ultra - fast spinning , heavily spotted , yellow giant fk comae berenices ( fk com : hd117555 ; g4 iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> this single star is thought to be a recent binary merger , and is exceptionally active by measure of its intense ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray emissions , and proclivity to flare . </S>",
    "<S> cocoa - pufs was carried out with hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) in the uv ( 12003000  ) , using mainly its high - performance cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) , but also high - precision space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ; _ chandra _ x - ray observatory in the soft x - rays ( 0.510 kev ) , utilizing its high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) ; together with supporting photometry and spectropolarimetry in the visible from the ground . </S>",
    "<S> this is an introductory report on the project .    </S>",
    "<S> fk com displayed variability on a wide range of time scales , over all wavelengths , during the week - long main campaign , including a large x - ray flare ; `` super - rotational broadening '' of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) `` hot - lines '' ( e.g. , 1393  ; @xmath0 k ) together with chromospheric 2800    and 1335    ( 13@xmath1  k ) ; large doppler swings suggestive of bright regions alternately on advancing and retreating limbs of the star ; and substantial redshifts of the epoch - average emission profiles . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors paint a picture of a highly extended , dynamic , hot ( @xmath2  mk ) coronal magnetosphere around the star , threaded by cooler structures perhaps analogous to solar prominences , and replenished continually by surface activity and flares . </S>",
    "<S> suppression of angular momentum loss by the confining magnetosphere could temporarily postpone the inevitable stellar spindown , thereby lengthening this highly volatile stage of coronal evolution . </S>"
