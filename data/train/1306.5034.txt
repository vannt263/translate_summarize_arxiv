    "the reaction terms vanish and the transport equation reduces to a convection - diffusion equation .",
    "we assume a constant diffusivity @xmath20 and reaction rate @xmath2 , which captures the essential characteristics of the reactive - infiltration instability .",
    "a complete description of solute dispersion and reaction in porous media is complex @xcite , but more general dispersion @xmath21 and reaction @xmath22 coefficients can be incorporated within the same framework .    the rate of increase in porosity ( @xmath23 ) is much smaller than the reaction rate ( @xmath2 ) because the molar concentration of solid ( @xmath18 ) is typically orders of magnitude larger than the reactant concentration ( @xmath24 ) . this time scale separation can be quantified by introducing the acid capacity number , @xmath25 $ ] , which corresponds to the volume of porous matrix dissolved by a unit volume of reactant . in typical geophysical systems",
    "the reactant is dilute @xmath26 and therefore @xmath27 ; for example , when calcite is dissolved by aqueous @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "this allows us to drop the time derivatives in the flow and transport equations ( [ eq : p2d][eq : c2d ] ) and treat the velocity and concentration fields as stationary , slaved to the porosity field by means of the erosion equation .",
    "the resulting equations are closed by auxiliary conditions far from the front : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a unit vector in the direction of the flow ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "far upstream ( @xmath33 ) the fluid velocity ( @xmath3 ) and reactant concentration ( @xmath34 ) are uniform , and the matrix is fully dissolved . far downstream ( @xmath35 )",

    "upstream of the front , indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] , all the soluble material has dissolved and the porosity is constant , @xmath9 . nevertheless ,",
    "because of the diffusive flux , the concentration profile is not uniform in this region , but decays from its inlet value @xmath34 over a characteristic length @xmath45 .",
    "convection - dominated theories @xcite neglect this scale , setting the concentration at the front to @xmath34 , but our analysis shows that this is a singular limit ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : w1lim ] ) and that even small diffusive contributions to the reactant flux make a large difference to the growth rate .",
    "downstream from the front , material is still being dissolved and here the concentration decays with a different length scale , @xmath46 ; the porosity returns to its initial value @xmath47 on the same scale .",
    "if the thickness of the downstream front is neglected then the reactive - infiltration instability can be mapped to a thin - front problem @xcite , with an @xmath2-independent growth rate ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : w1diff ] ) .",
    "these results have been widely used to draw inferences about the mechanisms and growth rates for morphological changes in rocks , but the range of validity of this limit is more restricted than is generally realized .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that the front - thickness can be neglected whenever the acid capacity is small ( @xmath27 ) , a condition that is widely applicable in nature and which is implicit in eq .  .",
    "by including the acid capacity in their definition of reaction rate , @xmath48 , they necessarily take the fast - reaction limit @xmath49 as @xmath50 ( keeping @xmath51 finite ) @xcite .",
    "missing from this analysis is what physical quantity @xmath2 must be large with respect to ; eq .",
    "suggests that a sharp front , meaning @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) , will only occur when @xmath53 .",
    "thus there is no general reduction of the reactive - infiltration instability to a thin - front problem ; it is only appropriate as a limiting case when the dimensionless combination of reaction rate , flow rate , and diffusion , @xmath54 .",
    "the importance of the interplay between reaction , diffusion and convection in a dissolving rock matrix was first noted by @xcite and @xcite , while the relevance of the parameter @xmath55 to wormhole growth was recognized by  @xcite ; nevertheless , they did not incorporate their insights into a stability analysis .",
    "however , @xcite discussed a similar interaction of length scales in the related problem of melt flow in the mantle ; here the interplay of matrix compaction and solubility gradient leads to an instability in an otherwise steady , non - propagating porosity profile .",
    "fracture dissolution is also characterized by an instability in a non - propagating ( but time - dependent ) front  @xcite .",
    "however , the impact of diffusion in systems with propagating versus non - propagating fronts is fundamentally different : in moving front problems , diffusion can completely stabilize the growth @xcite , whereas in the case of non - propagating profiles it weakens the growth but does not make it stable @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a new analysis of the instability in a steadily propagating dissolution front , which includes both upstream ( where the material is fully dissolved ) and downstream regions ; we recover previous results @xcite as limiting cases .",
    "stationary one - dimensional solutions of eq .",
    "form the base state for the linear stability analysis : @xmath56 the pclet number is defined on the scale of the downstream length , @xmath57 , and is equal to the ratio of upstream and downstream length scales , @xmath58 ; it is a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath59 ; @xmath60 .",
    "although @xmath61 is usually based on pore size or sample size , geophysical systems are typically unbounded ; then the reactant penetration length is the largest and most important length scale .",
    "perturbations to the porosity , velocity and concentration fields are determined by linearizing about the base state ; _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath62 the result of the stability analysis is a fifth - order differential equation for the downstream porosity perturbation @xmath63 , with solutions that depend on @xmath61 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . here",
    "we take a @xmath67 relation for the permeability @xmath68 and solve for the downstream @xmath63 using a spectral method  @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions at the front were constructed by matching to analytic solutions for the upstream perturbations in velocity and concentration .",
    "two boundary conditions suffice to determine @xmath63 for a given @xmath65 , and the remaining boundary condition is used to determine the growth rate @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the porosity contrast . details of the linear stability analysis are given in the auxiliary material .    the connection between the various limiting cases @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 can be made explicit by developing a perturbation expansion in the porosity contrast @xmath74 .",
    "the final result for the growth rate is @xmath75 where the time scale @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is a simple but lengthy algebraic function ( see auxiliary material ) .",
    "characteristic dispersion curves for convection - dominated dissolution ( @xmath71 ) are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : w0 ] for a small porosity contrast @xmath78 . for large pclet numbers , eq .   can be replaced by a simpler expression , @xmath79 with results that are indistinguishable from eq . on the scale of the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : w0 ] .    .",
    "the upper panel shows the dispersion curves in the downstream scaling for large values of pclet number : @xmath80 ( solid ) , @xmath81 ( dashed ) , @xmath82 ( dotted ) and @xmath83 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the dispersion curves in the upstream scaling for small values of pclet number : @xmath84 ( solid ) , @xmath85 ( dashed ) , @xmath86 ( dotted ) and @xmath87 ( dot - dashed ) respectively , width=480 ]    in the convective limit ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath65 rises monotonically with increasing wavevector , reaching an asymptotic value @xmath89 as in @xcite",
    ". however , even a small diffusivity cuts off the short wavelengths ( @xmath90 ) , leading to a pronounced maximum in the growth rate .",
    "this implies that there will be a strong wavelength selection even in highly convective flows and that short wavelength perturbations will not grow .",
    "thus , the convective limit is singular ; unstable terms saturate for large values of @xmath91 and are eventually overwhelmed by the diffusive stabilization .",
    "as the pclet number decreases , diffusional stabilization reduces the growth rate and pushes the range of unstable wavelengths towards @xmath92 . when @xmath73 , the dispersion relation takes a particularly simple form in variables scaled by the upstream length and time , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where the upstream time scale @xmath95 .",
    "physically , this rescaling is associated with the change in length scale from convection - dominated infiltration , @xmath96 , to diffusion - dominated infiltration , @xmath97 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : w0 ] shows that the dispersion relation in this scaling reaches a limiting form for small @xmath61 , @xmath98 shown by the solid line ; this is the thin - front limit ( @xmath99 ) considered in  @xcite , with @xmath100 .",
    "the most important result from an analysis of the reactive - infiltration instability is the wavelength of the fastest growing mode , @xmath101 .",
    "natural patterns are expected to develop on this scale @xcite , at least initially , since this particular wavelength grows exponentially faster than neighboring ones , with a time scale @xmath102 .",
    "the fastest - growing length and time scales are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : umax ] over a range of darcy velocities , from @xmath103 .",
    "the lower end of the scale covers the range of naturally occurring flow rates , while much higher velocities ( up to @xmath104 ) are found in reservoir acidization .",
    "results are shown for three different reaction time scales : @xmath105 , which is characteristic of slowly dissolving minerals such as quartz and certain redox reactions , @xmath106 , which is typical of the dissolution of clays , and @xmath107 which is characteristic of fast dissolving minerals such as calcite or gypsum ; we will consider some specific examples in the discussion . throughout",
    "we will assume a constant diffusion coefficient , @xmath108 .",
    "figure  [ fig : umax ] shows there is a lower bound to the wavelength and time scale with respect to the flow velocity , which occurs around @xmath109 in each case . starting in the thin - front limit ( @xmath110 ) , an increasing velocity reduces the wavelength by decreasing the upstream penetration length @xmath111 ; in this region ( @xmath112 ) the downstream penetration length is small .",
    "however , as @xmath3 increases further the downstream length begins to grow and when @xmath113 takes over as the dominant scale ; in this case an increase in velocity increases the penetration length and so the scale of the instability grows .",
    "interestingly the plot suggests that instability wavelengths will fall in a range between millimeters and a few hundred meters , since the highest flow rates are typically associated with reservoir acidization , where reaction rates are high ( red curves ) .",
    "similarly , there is a lower bound to the time scale ; once the downstream penetration length starts to take over the growth rate of the instability becomes independent of velocity .",
    "it should be noted that in order to obtain universal curves we have plotted @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig : umax ] ; the dissolution time for a particular mineral can be found by dividing by the acid capacity ( typically @xmath115 ) .    the most unstable wavelength @xmath116 decreases with increasing porosity contrast up to @xmath117 . in the diffusive regime",
    "it then saturates but in the convective regime @xmath116 increases sharply with velocity , as shown by the solid squares in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : umax ] .",
    "this results from the appearance of a long wavelength maximum in the dispersion curve at high porosity contrasts ( @xmath118 ) , which persists from @xmath119 to the convective limit @xcite . the analytic theory remains valid up to @xmath120 ( dashed lines ) as can be seen by the comparison with numerical results ( solid circles ) .",
    "a reactive - infiltration instability can occur in almost any system in which chemical dissolution is coupled with fluid flow .",
    "variations in reaction rate ( @xmath2 ) and flow rate ( @xmath3 ) give rise to a wide range of length scales , from centimeter scale redox fronts in siltstones  @xcite to kilometer - long scalloping of a dolomitization front  @xcite .",
    "the span of timescales is also large ; acidized plaster  @xcite and limestone cores  @xcite or salt flushed with water  @xcite finger in minutes , while geological structures evolve over hundreds of thousands of years .",
    "groundwater velocities are usually small , @xmath121 , while the timescale for dissolution ( @xmath122 ) varies from seconds to years ; thus both diffusion - dominated ( @xmath123 ) and convection - dominated ( @xmath124 ) dissolution can occur .",
    "the formation of salt sinkholes is an example of diffusion - dominated dissolution ; here @xmath125 and @xmath3 is in the range @xmath126  @xcite , which means it is in the diffusive regime ( @xmath127 ) . for the large porosity contrast typical of salt dissolution ( @xmath128 ) , the maximum unstable wavelength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : umax ] ) is then @xmath129 , which is in the range of results reported in  @xcite .",
    "the associated timescales are of the order of @xmath130 years ( with @xmath131 ) ; thus sinkholes would be expected to develop over tens of years , which is comparable with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "( upper panel ) , and time scale , @xmath132 ( lower panel ) , are shown for different reaction rates : @xmath133 ( black ) , @xmath134 ( blue ) , and @xmath135 ( red ) . for each reaction rate results",
    "are shown at three different porosity contrasts : @xmath78 ( solid line ) , @xmath136 ( dashed line and circles ) , and @xmath137 ( squares ) .",
    "analytic results from are shown by lines and numerical results from the spectral code are shown by the solid symbols .",
    "the acid capacity @xmath138 is needed to determine the actual dissolution time scale for a specific mineral.,width=480 ]    even though the natural flow rates in most rock formations are small , convection - dominated dissolution can still occur , particularly if only a small fraction of the grains are reactive .",
    "relevant examples include uranium deposition , in which a solution containing soluble uranium salts reacts with pyrites ( fes ) embedded in a sandstone matrix ; this alters the redox potential and causes uranium to precipitate as uraninite ( uranium oxide ) @xcite . since the pyrites constitute only about 2% of the total rock matrix  @xcite , the rate of uranium precipitation is small , @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "oxidation of pyrites produces sulfuric acid , which dissolves some of the rock matrix ; the increase in porosity ( @xmath140 , @xcite ) causes a reactive - infiltration instability in the uraninite front . within the typical range of sandstone permeability , dissolution can be either convection - dominated or diffusion - dominated .",
    "the thin - front limit applies when the flow velocity is less than @xmath141 ; here the scale of the front is predicted to be about @xmath142 , varying as @xmath143 . however , at higher flow velocities the scale decreases more slowly because of the transition to convection - dominated dissolution , with a minimum wavelength of about @xmath144 ( at @xmath145 ) . at @xmath146",
    "the scale is again about @xmath142 , whereas the thin - front prediction would be more than an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "field observations indicate spacings between uraninite fingers in the range @xmath147 to @xmath148  @xcite ; in the latter case , since the fingers are very prominent , the observed spacing most likely reflects a non - linear selection process , which eliminates many smaller channels ( see below ) .",
    "fluid velocities during acidization of carbonate reservoirs are larger than in naturally occurring groundwater flows , @xmath149  @xcite , and it is frequently assumed that acidization is convection dominated @xcite . however",
    ", rapid dissolution of calcite by concentrated hydrochloric acid ( frequently used in acidization ) , combined with the large reactive surface area of calcite , can lead to reaction rates as high as @xmath150  @xcite , although weaker acids , such has acetic or formic acid , have dissolution rates that are @xmath151 times slower .",
    "thus acidization spans the range from convection - dominated ( @xmath152 ) to diffusion - dominated dissolution ( @xmath153 ) , but the predicted length scales are always in the sub - centimeter range . at the smallest flow rates ( @xmath154 ) , dissolution tends to be diffusion dominated , with a typical length scale of the order of @xmath155 , independent of reaction rate . at the highest flow rates ( @xmath156 ) the reactant penetrates downstream , leading to significantly larger scales ( @xmath157 ) than would be predicted from the thin - front limit ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "intriguingly there may be a connection between the minimum scale of the instability ( fig .",
    "[ fig : umax ] ) and the optimization of reactant consumption during acidization @xcite .",
    "although the dynamics of wormhole formation are highly nonlinear , the interaction of convective , reactive , and diffusive length scales may be similar .    in this work we have presented the results of an analysis of the reactive - infiltration instability , which takes account of the two lengths scales that characterize the concentration field ;",
    "previous analysis @xcite assumed that one length or the other was dominant , corresponding to the limiting cases @xmath159 @xcite or @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "we have explained the connection between these apparently disparate theories and determined their range of validity ; in particular , we have shown that the thin - front limit only holds when @xmath161 and the convective limit when @xmath162 .",
    "we have given examples of reactive infiltration systems  in nature , laboratory experiments , and engineered systems  which span a wide range of @xmath55 , from @xmath152 to @xmath163 .",
    "finally , we note that there are significant limitations to the use of a linear stability analysis to interpret geological morphologies .",
    "first , reaction rates at the darcy scale are not well understood ; field measurements are frequently orders of magnitude smaller than those inferred from laboratory experiments .",
    "moreover , as the instability develops non - linear couplings lead to a coarsening of the pattern , with an increasing wavelength between the fingers  @xcite .",
    "the competition between different fingers causes the shorter ones to be arrested , which can be clearly seen in the terra - rossa fingers in fig .",
