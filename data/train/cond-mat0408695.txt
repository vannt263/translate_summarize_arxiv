    "<S> we have derived the interaction between jahn - teller centers due to optical and acoustic phonons . without coulomb repulsion </S>",
    "<S> the model leads to a global phase separation at low temperature . at long distances coulomb repulsion </S>",
    "<S> always dominates the short range attraction leading to phase separation on a short scale . on the basis of monte - carlo simulation of microscopic lattice - gas model </S>",
    "<S> we have formulated an effective phenomenological model . in the limit of low density of polarons , </S>",
    "<S> phase separation takes place in the form of charged bubbles . in the limit of high density , </S>",
    "<S> charge segregation occurs on domain walls .    </S>",
    "<S> there is substantial evidence that the ground state in many of oxides is inhomogeneous@xcite . in cuprates , </S>",
    "<S> for example neutron - scattering experiments suggest that phase segregation takes place in the form of stripes or short segments of stripes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is some controversy whether this phase segregation is associated with magnetic interactions . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> it is also generally accepted that the charge density in cuprates is not homogeneous .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of charge segregation in cuprates appeared just after discovery of high - tc materials @xcite . in most cases long - range coulomb repulsion </S>",
    "<S> was not considered . </S>",
    "<S> recently it was suggested that interplay of the short range lattice attraction and the long - range coulomb repulsion between charge carriers could lead to the formation of short metallic @xcite or insulating@xcite stripes of polarons . if the attractive potential is isotropic , charged bubbles have a spherical shape . </S>",
    "<S> kugel and khomskii @xcite suggested recently that the anisotropic attraction forces caused by jahn - teller centers could lead to the phase segregation in the form of stripes . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range anisotropic attraction forces appear as the solution of the full set of elasticity equations ( see ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternative approach to take into account elasticity potentials was proposed in ref.@xcite and is based on the proper consideration of compatibility constraint caused by absence of a dislocation in the solid .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we formulated the model@xcite where we suggested that interaction of a two - fold degenerate electronic state with @xmath0 phonon modes at a finite wave - vector can lead to a local nonsymmetric deformation and short - length scale charge segregation . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested @xcite that this phase separation may lead to the insulator to superconductor phase transition governed by percolation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we reduce the proposed model to the lattice gas model and show that the model indeed displays phase separation , which may occur in the form of stripes or clusters depending on anisotropy of the short range attraction between localized carriers . </S>",
    "<S> we also generalize the model taking into account interaction of the jahn - teller centers via elasticity induced field .    </S>",
    "<S> we first derive a simplified lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the model without coulomb repulsion displays a first order phase transition at a constant chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> when the number of particles is fixed , the system is unstable with respect to the global phase separation below a certain critical temperature . in the presence of the coulomb repulsion </S>",
    "<S> , global phase separation becomes unfavorable due to a large contribution to the energy from long range coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the system shows mesoscopic phase separation where the size of charged regions is determined by the competition between the energy gain due to ordering and energy cost due to breaking of the local charge neutrality . </S>",
    "<S> since the short range attraction is anisotropic the phase separation may be in the form of short segments or / and stripes .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin by considering a simplified version of the jt model hamiltonian @xcite , taking only the deformation of the @xmath1 symmetry : @xmath2 here the pauli matrix @xmath3 describes two components of the electronic doublet , and @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a symmetric function describing the range of the interaction . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we omit the spin index in the sum . </S>",
    "<S> the model could be easily reduced to a lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the classical variable @xmath6 and minimize the energy as a function of @xmath7 in the presence of the harmonic term @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the deformation , which corresponds to the minimum of energy , @xmath9 substituting @xmath10 into the hamiltonian ( 1 ) and taking into account that the carriers are charged we arrive at the lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> we use a pseudospin operator @xmath11 to describe the occupancies of the two electronic levels @xmath12and @xmath13 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 corresponds to the state with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 to @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous occupancy of both levels is excluded due to a high onsite coulomb repulsion energy . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian in terms of the pseudospin operator is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is the coulomb potential , @xmath25 is the charge of electron , @xmath26 is the static dielectric constant and @xmath27 is the effective unit cell period . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic short range attraction potential is given by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the attraction in this model is generated by the interaction of electrons with optical phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the attraction force is determined by the radius of the electron - phonon interaction and the dispersion of the optical phonons@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar model can be formulated in the limit of continuous media . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the deformation is characterized by the components of the strain tensor . </S>",
    "<S> for the two dimensional case we can define 3 components of the strain tensor : @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 transforming as the @xmath32 , @xmath1 and @xmath33 representations of the @xmath34 group respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these components of the tensor are coupled linearly with the two - fold degenerate electronic state which transforms as the @xmath35 or @xmath36 representation of the point group . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the case of previously considered interaction with optical phonons we keep the interaction with the deformation @xmath37 of the @xmath1 symmetry only . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian without the coulomb repulsion term has the form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are corresponding components of the elastic modulus tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the components of the strain tensor are not independent @xcite and satisfy to the compatibility condition . </S>",
    "<S> the compatibility condition leads to a long range anisotropic interaction between polarons . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian in the reciprocal space has the form : @xmath40 the fourrier transform of the potential is given by : @xmath41 by minimizing the energy with respect to @xmath42 and taking into account the long - range coulomb repulsion we again derive eq.(3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic interaction potential @xmath43 is determined by the interaction with the classical deformation and is long - range . </S>",
    "<S> it decays as @xmath44 at large distances in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> since the attraction forces decay faster then the coulomb repulsion forces at large distances the attraction can overcome the coulomb repulsion at short distances , leading to a mesoscopic phase separation .    </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of whether the resulting interaction between polarons is generated by acoustic or optical phonons the main physical picture remains the same . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> there is an anisotropic attraction between polarons on short distances </S>",
    "<S> . the interaction could be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic in terms of the pseudospin operators depending on mutual orientation of the orbitals . without loosing generality </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath45 is nonzero only for the nearest neighbors .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to study the model ( eq.(3 ) ) at constant average density , @xmath46 where @xmath47is the total number of sites . </S>",
    "<S> however , to clarify the physical picture it is more appropriate to perform calculations with a fixed chemical potential first by adding the term @xmath48 to the hamiltonian ( 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> models such as ( 3 ) , but in the absence of the long - range forces , were studied many years ago on the basis of the molecular - field approximation in the bragg - williams formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field equations for the particle density @xmath49 and the pseudospin magnetization @xmath50 have the form@xcite : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the number of the nearest neighbours for a square lattice in 2d and @xmath53  is the boltzman constant </S>",
    "<S> . a phase transition to an ordered state with a finite @xmath54 may be of either the first or the second order , depending on the value of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath56 it is always of the second order and @xmath57 as @xmath58 . for the large negative values </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 the phase transition is absent and @xmath60 as @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> for the physically important case @xmath61 ordering occures as a result of the first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> two solutions of eqs.(8,9 ) with @xmath62 and with finite @xmath54 corresponds to two different minima of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> the line of the phase transition is determined by the condition : @xmath63 where @xmath54 is the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) ( fig.1 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the number of particles is fixed ( eq.9 ) the system is unstable with respect to global phase separation below @xmath64 . as a result at fixed average @xmath49 two phases with @xmath65 and @xmath66 coexist .    to investigate further the properties of the system , we performed monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations of the hamiltonian eq.(3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were performed on a square lattice with dimensions up to @xmath67 sites with @xmath68 using a standard metropolis algorithm@xcite in combination with simulated annealing@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first , for comparison with mf theory , the monte - carlo simulation of the model eq.(3 ) in absence of the coulomb forces shows the reduction of @xmath64 due to fluctuations in 2d , by a factor of @xmath69 ( fig.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next we include the coulomb interaction @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we use open boundary conditions to avoid complications due to the long range coulomb forces and ensure global electroneutrality by adding an electrostatic potential due to the uniformly charged background @xmath71  to ( 3 ) , such that the monte carlo interaction becomes @xmath72 , with the total background charge being equal in magnitude to the total charge of carriers , @xmath73 , but with opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless temperature @xmath74 @xmath75 , and the energy per particle are defined as @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the short range potential @xmath77 was taken to be nonzero only for @xmath78 and was therefore specified for nearest neighbours and next nearest neighbours as @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the monte carlo simulations could be summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath81 ) coulomb repulsion leads to further reduction of the onset temperature of phase separation ( see fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath82 ) depending on the value of the attractive potential and its anisotropy phase separation takes place in the form of bubbles , horizontal and vertical or diagonal stripes ( fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath83 ) depending on the anisotropy of the potential stripes ( bubbles ) are ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically orbitally ordered ( fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath84 ) the size of clusters is determined by the ratio of short range attraction and long - range coulomb energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the monte - carlo simulation of the model ( 3 ) allow general model independent interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the classical free energy density corresponding to the first order phase transition : @xmath85 here @xmath86 is dimensionless temperature . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the order parameter @xmath87 is coupled to the local charge density @xmath88 , @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the total free energy density should contain the gradient term @xmath90 and electrostatic energy @xmath91 as well . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic potential is determined from the poisson equation @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> here we write @xmath93 explicitly to take into account global electroneutrality . substituting the solution of the poisson equation to the electrostatic energy we obtain @xmath94 , here @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> minimization of @xmath96 at fixed @xmath86 and @xmath97 gives the spatial variation of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the results of minimization are presented in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> as clearly seen from fig.3 at low density phase separation takes place in the form of bubbles of optimal radius which are ordered . </S>",
    "<S> when density increases charge segregation appears in the form of charged domain walls .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that a single bubble of the ordered phase with the radius @xmath98 has appeared . </S>",
    "<S> as it was discussed in @xcite the energy of the bubble is determined as : @xmath99 , here @xmath100 is the energy difference between two minima in the free energy , @xmath101 is the surface energy , and @xmath102 determines the energy due local breaking of the charge neutrality . if @xmath103 @xmath37 has well defined minimum . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum corresponds to optimal size of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> residual interactions leads to interbubble interactions and ordering of clusters at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that anisotropic interaction between jahn - teller centers generated by optical and/or acoustical phonons leads to the short scale phase separation in the presence of the long range coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> topology of texturing differs from charged bobbles to oriented charged stripes depending on the anisotropy of short range potential .    </S>",
