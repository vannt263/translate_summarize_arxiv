    "the high energy behaviour of longitudinal vector boson scattering ( lvbs ) , @xmath0 , reflects the strength of the interactions in the symmetry breaking ( sb ) sector .",
    "the sm with a light higgs predicts a big suppression of longitudinal boson scattering and a weakly coupled symmetry breaking sector , while without the higgs lvbs grows with the scattering energy @xmath1 and must be cut off by new strong dynamics at higher scales  @xcite .",
    "heavy resonances from the sb sector are possible at lhc energy scale , however an equally likely signature is simply an excess of events at high energy in comparison with the sm predictions .",
    "this excess of events can be mimicked by the sm without the higgs , whose predictions can be compared with more specific models .",
    "for instance , a promising alternative to the complete replacement of the higgs mechanism is to interpret the higgs as a pseudo - goldstone boson of a new strongly - interacting sector  @xcite .",
    "this class of models predict in general a smaller excess than the _ no higgs _  ( noh ) case .",
    "on the other hand , models with lighter resonances normally predict a larger excess of events .",
    "residing on this frontier , the noh model represents a benchmark scenario for the study of strong sb dynamics .",
    "a recent study  @xcite has estimated the power of the lhc to distinguish the _ no higgs _ scenario from the sm through vbs in a complete partonic analysis of the @xmath2 + 4 jets channel .",
    "this result , complemented with the others important still unpublished channels , are presented in the following .",
    "the only way to observe vbs at lhc is by looking at the vector bosons through their decays into fermions .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 is necessarily embedded in a more general gauge invariant set comprehending all processes with six - parton final states . in order to have a good description of the high energy behaviour of such processes",
    "it is necessary to compute the complete set of feynman diagrams taking in account all irreducible backgrounds and their interferences with signal topologies , because of large gauge cancellations  @xcite .",
    "we have analyzes , from this six - parton perspective , the following channels : @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 stands for any quark or gluon and @xmath7 for muons or electrons . using the ` phantom `  @xcite event generator , a mc dedicated to processes with six partons in the final state",
    ", we have generated the electroweak part , @xmath8 , for the light higgs and the _ no higgs _ scenarios , and the @xmath9 qcd background .",
    "for the @xmath10 v+4jets qcd background of the semi - leptonic channels , we have used ` madevent `  @xcite .",
    "the vbs experimental signature can be basically described by the presence of tag jets , two very energetic jets in the forward - backward direction , and two pairs of fermions associated with vb decays in the central region , with high transverse momenta .",
    "we have performed a cut - based selection in order to simultaneously characterize the signal and suppress the background for each channel , with the aim to optimize the probability to obtain experimental results outside the @xmath11 confidence region ( pbsm@95% cl ) for the sm , assuming the _ no higgs _ scenario .    for tagging jets we required @xmath12 and @xmath13  gev . for the characterization of leptonic vector bosons we used @xmath14 and @xmath15  gev . in the semi - leptonic channels ,",
    "the dominant background is @xmath16  jets , pushing us to a very tight characterization of the hadronic vector boson : we required @xmath17  gev and @xmath18  gev @xmath19  gev .",
    "for the isolation of both reconstructed bosons we imposed @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , a further specialized set of cuts was applied to each channel to help in distinguishing the scenarios .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath21 channel , top rejection is quite important .",
    "the expected number of events for @xmath22  fb@xmath23 for each channel after all cuts are reported in table  [ nevents ] .",
    ".expected number of events for @xmath22  fb@xmath23 after all cuts , for each perturbative order .",
    "the contribution from the qcd background is essentially the same for the _ no higgs _ and the sm case . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the probability distribution for each scenario was computed by taking the mc prediction ( table  [ nevents ] ) as the mean value and then estimating the associated uncertainties .",
    "we have assumed a poissonian statistical distribution and modeled the theoretical uncertainty due to parton distributions , scale dependence and higher order corrections with a @xmath24 flat smearing around the mean value . for the semi - leptonic channels , the theoretical error for @xmath25  jets totally overwhelms the possibility of appreciating differences between the scenarios .",
    "fortunately , at lhc , it will be possible to get rid of this uncertainty using side - band techniques .",
    "the mass distribution of the central jets , @xmath26 , is characterized by a peak in the range @xmath18@xmath27  gev , due to vector boson decays .",
    "the peak is surrounded by a slowly varying region populated by jet pairs from the @xmath25  jets background .",
    "this almost flat distribution can be measured and interpolated to the peak region , providing an estimate of the @xmath25  jets background which is free of theoretical errors .    finally , we defined a discriminator @xmath28 , which estimates the excess of events above the measured side - bands taking in account the theoretical and statistical errors of @xmath29 and the statistical errors of @xmath25  jets background . for the leptonic channel we directly used the number of events subject to all sources of errors .",

    "we have estimated the power of the lhc in distinguishing the _ no higgs _ scenario from the sm . for this , we have performed a complete partonic analysis generating full six - partons final states .",
    "we have developed a strategy to suppress the main backgrounds using strong selection cuts , aiming at optimizing the pbsm@95% cl . with this approach",
    "we obtain a precise probabilistic meaning of the discriminatory power , which has been generalized to the combination of many channels .",
