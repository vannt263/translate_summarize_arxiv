    "recently , some effort has been invested into the investigation of compactons , that is , soliton solutions of non - linear field theories with compact support . by now , two established classes of scalar field theories are known which give rise to the existence of compacton solutions .",
    "one may either choose potentials in the lagrangian ( or energy density ) which have a non - continuous first derivative at ( some of ) their minima @xcite - @xcite , or one may employ a non - standard kinetic term ( @xmath1 field theory ) @xcite , @xcite . concretely",
    ", the kinetic term has to contain higher than second powers in the first derivatives of the fields . for nonrelativistic field theories",
    ", compactons were first discovered and studied for some generalizations of the kdv equation in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "compactons can be realized directly in some mechanical systems @xcite , and , in addition , they have been applied recently to brane cosmology @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of these investigations have dealt with topological compactons , where the existence and stability of the compacton solutions is related to a nontrivial vacuum manifold and some nonzero topological charge .",
    "also in this letter we shall mainly deal with this case of topological compactons , which turn out to have the shape of shells , and only at the end we will investigate a similar theory which , however , gives rise to non - topological compactons with a ball shape .    as is typical in soliton theory in general , it is easier to find systems with compacton solutions in low ( that is 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the simplest , most obvious generalization of topological compacton systems with a non - standard kinetic term to higher dimensions meets the same obstacles as in the case of conventional solitons , and also the remedy to circumvent the obstacle is the same , namely the introduction of a gauge field in addition to the scalar fields , like in the case of vortices and monopoles @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we shall pursue a different path for the construction of higher - dimensional topological compactons . concretely",
    ", we couple a real scalar field @xmath3 with non - standard kinetic term to a complex scalar field @xmath4 where @xmath4 maps from a compact submanifold of the base space ( @xmath2 or @xmath5 for @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively ) to an @xmath2 target space , thereby providing an important contribution to the non - trivial topology of the compacton solutions . the non - trivial topology is completed by the boundary conditions on @xmath3 required by finiteness of the energy . for the model constructed in section 2 , the complex scalar field @xmath4 has the topology of a hopf map @xmath8 , and @xmath3 provides the suspension of this hopf map to a map @xmath9 .",
    "the base space for this example is , therefore , 4 + 1 dimensional . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss similar models which allow for compactons in 3 + 1 dimensions , where @xmath4 describes a map @xmath10 . in section 3.1 ,",
    "we study a model which again gives rise to analytical solutions which are shell - shaped . in section 3.2",
    "we introduce a slightly different model , where it turns out that the compact solitons are ball - shaped and , further , are no longer topological .",
    "the specific @xmath11 dimensional model we are going to consider is given by the following expression @xmath12 where @xmath13 etc .",
    "it describes a real scalar field @xmath3 with a non - standard kinetic term coupled to the pure skyrme term constrained to @xmath2 target space @xmath14 . \\label{h}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 is a complex scalar providing via the stereographic projection a parametrisation of @xmath2 .",
    "this lagrangian provides a simple , minimal generalization of the concept of @xmath1 fields to a model with @xmath5 target space . here ,",
    "minimal means that only one of the degrees of freedom is of the @xmath1 type . for different ,",
    "non - minimal generalizations see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "observe that the above lagrangian can also be derived by a reduction of a scalar @xmath1 field coupled to the standard @xmath15 non - abelian gauge field i.e. , of @xmath1-dilaton yang  mills theory .",
    "the coupling between both fields is of the non - minimal type and governed by the coupling function @xmath16 which is chosen in the form @xmath17 notice that the coupling function is semipositive definite and vanishes for two values of the scalar field @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it plays the role of an effective potential with two effective vacua for @xmath3 .",
    "the constant @xmath19 is a free parameter of the model .",
    "+ the pertinent field equations read @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 in order to derive static solutions we introduce the coordinates @xmath23 where @xmath24 ,",
    "\\phi_1 \\in [ 0,2\\pi ] , \\phi_2 \\in [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] are coordinates on @xmath5 , and @xmath25 gives the extension to @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we assume the ansatz @xmath26 and @xmath27 this ansatz provides that @xmath28 and , as a consequence , one can remove the coupling function @xmath16 from equation ( [ eq u ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq u ] ) for the field @xmath4 simplifies , in fact , to the field equation for the lagrangian @xmath29 with base space @xmath5 .",
    "solutions to this model have been constructed in @xcite , @xcite , and below we just review the results which we need in the sequel .",
    "+ concretely , the static equations of motion may be rewritten in the form @xmath30",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 the last expression may be simplified @xmath34 thus , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an integration constant .",
    "one can proceed further and solve this equation .",
    "however , for the topologically nontrivial configurations the complex field @xmath4 should cover the whole target space @xmath2 at least once .",
    "this requirement gives a condition for the integration constants leading to the solutions @xmath37 in the case when @xmath38 we arrive at the very simply formula @xmath39 moreover , such a complex field being a map from @xmath5 ( the base space parameterized by @xmath40 coordinates ) to the target @xmath2 can be classified by a topological invariant known as the hopf index .",
    "in fact , solution ( [ ansatz u ] ) , with ( [ sol f1 ] ) , ( [ sol f2 ] ) is known to carry a non - vanishing hopf index @xmath41 let us now turn to the field equation for the real scalar @xmath3 .",
    "first of all one can observe that this expression leads to an ordinary differential equation for @xmath42 only if @xmath43 in the solution for the @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , only the solution ( [ sol f2 ] ) is admissible .",
    "then , the @xmath44-dependence in the second term of ( [ eq xi1 ] ) cancels and we get @xmath45 introducing the new variable @xmath46 we find that @xmath47 this equation has been recently analyzed in the context of compact domain walls @xcite .",
    "the corresponding compacton solution located at @xmath48 reads @xmath49 \\\\ 1 & \\alpha x \\geq \\alpha x_0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\end{array } \\right.,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 finally , the 4 dimensional compacton solution is @xmath51 \\\\ 1 & \\alpha \\ln r \\geq \\alpha x_0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\end{array } \\right.,\\ ] ] ( where @xmath52 ) , together with @xmath53 with the hopf index of the underlying hopf maps equal to @xmath54 .",
    "+ the size of the compact soliton , if treated as an object living in the original 4 dimensional space , varies as one changes its position .",
    "the inner and outer compacton boundary points @xmath55 are @xmath56 where @xmath52 gives a parametrisation of the center of the solution .",
    "thus the shell radius is @xmath57 as we see , the compacton is getting narrower as it approaches the origin . on the other hand its radius grows while it moves in the opposite direction .",
    "+ the energy of the solution is given as follows @xmath58 thus , @xmath59 @xmath60 it is clearly visible that the compact solution for the real scalar field is of the bogomolny type , satisfying a first order differential equation , which may be easily derived from ( [ bog ] ) using the standard bogomolny trick .",
    "+ specifically , for the one - compacton configuration we find @xmath61 interestingly , the energy depends on a non - integer power of the hopf charge of the underlying @xmath4 field , like in the vakulenko - kapitansky formula @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that this relation between energy and hopf charge does not provide an energy bound for general hopf charge , because the full field configuration is a suspended hopf map , and its topological classification is therefore given by the homotopy group @xmath62 , as we demonstrate below .",
    "+ so let us prove that the obtained configuration may be understood as a suspended hopf map , i.e. , a map from the @xmath63 base space onto the @xmath5 target space characterized by the nontrivial homotopy class @xmath64 .",
    "it is convenient to combine the fields @xmath65 into a @xmath15 matrix @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the unit matrix .",
    "thus , the @xmath66 field maps @xmath7 onto the three dimensional target sphere . for every fixed value of @xmath70",
    "the @xmath66 field is just a hopf map @xmath71 with the previously found nonvanishing topological charge . for @xmath72 ,",
    "representing the poles of @xmath5 , we get the identity map . therefore we get a full covering of the @xmath5 .",
    "the boundary condition , @xmath73 as @xmath74 , allows for compactification of the original @xmath7 space to @xmath63 .",
    "these facts render the @xmath66 a representative of the nontrivial homotopy class @xcite .",
    "we remark that topological solitons which may be classified as suspended hopf maps ( although not of the compacton type ) have been studied recently , e.g. , in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "+ interestingly , the compactons we found do not have the structure of a ball .",
    "instead , they have the form of a shell , where the energy density is radially symmetric , and is zero both inside the inner compacton boundary and outside the outer boundary .",
    "further , the one compacton solution may be easily extended to multi - compacton configurations by taking an alternating collection of sufficiently separated compactons ( which interpolate from the vacuum value @xmath75 to @xmath76 with increasing radius ) and anti - compactons ( which interpolate from @xmath76 to @xmath75 with increasing radius ) , forming an onion - like structure with one compacton or anti - compacton as the innermost shell , surrounded by further compacton and anti - compacton shells .",
    "the energy of the solution equals just the sum of the energies of all @xmath77 compact solitons .",
    "the corresponding topological charge is nontrivial if the number of compactons is not the same as the number of anticompactons , whereas it is zero if the number of compactons and anti - compactons is equal",
    ". we remark that the hopf charge of the @xmath4 field within each ( anti-)compacton may be chosen independently .",
    "+ let us also notice that the simplest compact hopf map is stable as far as linear radial perturbations are considered . in this case the stability analysis of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite holds .",
    "+ the existence of infinitely many exact suspended hopfion solutions in our model makes it interesting to further investigate its integrability properties .",
    "first we observe that the model has infinitely many symmetries and , therefore , infinitely many conserved currents .",
    "the symmetries are just the area - preserving diffeomorphisms acting on the target space @xmath2 spanned by the complex scalar field @xmath4 , and the conserved currents are the corresponding noether currents . one way to further analyse the integrability",
    "is provided by the generalized zero curvature condition of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , which gives a well - defined extension of the standard integrability criterion ( zakharov - shabat zero curvature representation ) to higher than two dimensions .",
    "the corresponding generalized zero curvature condition is the condition for the holonomy in higher loop space to be independent of the deformations of loops or , in other words , it is just a condition for the flatness of the connetion in loop space .",
    "moreover , assuming the reparametrization invariance of the holonomy , one gets local generalized zero curvature conditions , @xmath78 i.e. , flatness of a connetion @xmath79 and covariant constancy of a vector field @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a lie algebra and @xmath82 an abelian ideal ( a representation space of the lie algebra ) .",
    "a model is said to be integrable if one can rewrite the field equations as the generalized zero curvature conditions ( [ zc ] ) and if the abelian ideal used in the construction has infinite dimensions .",
    "+ one can verify that the model ( [ model ] ) admits such a generalized zero curvature formulation provided we impose an additional constraint on the fields .",
    "therefore our model , although not integrable in this sense , possesses an integrable sector defined by the following integrability condition @xmath83 in particular , the generalized zero curvature formulation of the submodel is given by @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the generators of the @xmath88 lie algebra and @xmath89 transforms under the spin-@xmath90 representation of @xmath88 .",
    "the equations of motion for the submodel are given by gzc in any spin representation , which implies the generalized integrability .",
    "the importance of this submodel emerges from the fact that our hopfions belong to it .",
    "indeed , they solve the field equation together with the constraint .",
    "+ one can compare the integrability properties of our model with the most known example of @xmath5 target space model i.e. , the skyrme model .",
    "the skyrme model does not have infinitely many symmetries , but it also has an integrable sector .",
    "however , in this case it is given by two integrability conditions @xmath91 thus , the integrable submodel is much more constrained , and this fact obviously affects the chance for the existence of exact solitons . in particular , the new condition ,",
    "that is , the eikonal equation , is rather restrictive .",
    "it leads to one exact , given solution once the nontrivial topology ( the hopf charge ) for @xmath4 is fixed ( more precisely , it leads to one fixed solution up to moebius transformations , that is , rotations of the target space @xmath2 where @xmath4 takes its values ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the first integrability condition , which is easily obeyed by a general separation of variables ansatz .",
    "this can explain why our model as well as its extention presented in the next section possess infinitely many exact solutions based on infinitely many hopf maps ( or infinitely many maps @xmath10 in the next section ) .",
    "+ the relation between the restrictions imposed by the integrability conditions and existence of exact solutions is also confirmed by recent investigations of the pure quartic ( euclidean ) skyrme model by speight [ 22 ] . in fact ,",
    "in this model , which from the point of view of the generalized integrability is exactly the same as the skyrme model , only one exact soliton with topology of the suspended hopfion has been found .",
    "it is not of the compacton type .",
    "here we want to study briefly some models which give rise to compacton solutions analogous to the case discussed in the preceding section , but in 3 + 1 dimensions , which is the case more directly relevant for physical applications .",
    "we shall discuss explicitly two cases .      in the first example , we observe that the lagrangian ( [ model ] ) of section 2 is quartic in first derivatives , therefore it is scale invariant precisely in four dimensions , which is one way to circumvent derrick s theorem and have static solutions in four dimensions . if we want to have static solutions in three dimensions , one possibility consists , therefore , in choosing a lagrangian cubic in first derivatives .",
    "this implies , however , that the resulting lagrangian is non - polynomial . for models of this type",
    "the study of time - dependent dynamics is problematic ( e.g. boundedness of the energy , or global hyperbolicity ) , therefore we shall introduce the energy functional for static configurations directly . concretely",
    ", the three - dimensional model we study has the following energy functional for static configurations @xmath92 \\label{model1 - 3d}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 .",
    "it is related to the model ( [ model ] ) of section 2 such that both terms of the model ( [ model ] ) are taken to the power @xmath94 .",
    "further , we have already reduced to the static case .",
    "if we now introduce three - dimensional spherical polar coordinates @xmath95 and use the ansatz @xmath42 , @xmath96 , then the coupling function can again be removed from the equation for @xmath4 , and this equation can be written as @xmath97^{-\\frac{1}{4}}}{(1+u\\bar u ) } \\right ) = 0 .\\ ] ] this equation is just the field equation of the model of aratyn , ferreira and zimermann ( afz ) is , in fact , precisely the energy density of the afz model . in three - dimensional ,",
    "euclidean base space , the afz model has infinitely many soliton solutions of the knot type @xcite , @xcite , whose existence is related both to the conformal base space symmetry and to the infinitely many target space symmetries of this model .",
    "here we are , however , interested in solutions on the base space @xmath2 . ] . for the ansatz @xmath98 it has the solutions @xmath99 where @xmath100 is an integer and these solutions @xmath4 describe maps @xmath10 with winding number @xmath100 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath101 reads @xmath102 the equation for @xmath103 for this ansatz is @xmath104 or , for the specific coupling function @xmath105 and the @xmath106 above , @xmath107 introducing again the variable @xmath46 , this equation becomes @xmath108 which has exactly the same compacton solution ( [ sol - x ] ) as in section 2 , where now the constant @xmath109 is @xmath110 therefore , this model has exactly the same shell - like spherically symmetric compacton solutions in three dimensions as the previous model of section 2 has in four dimensions .",
    "+ the topology of the compacton solutions is now given by maps @xmath0 .",
    "this topology may again be described by the su(2 ) matrix @xmath66 of eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , where , however , now the complex scalar @xmath4 is a map @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the solution field configuration takes its value at the north pole of the target space @xmath5 for @xmath75 ( inside the inner shell boundary ) , covers the full target @xmath5 while @xmath3 varies from @xmath111 to @xmath76 , and takes its value at the south pole for @xmath76 ( outside the outer shell boundary ) .",
    "+ also the integrability properties are exactly equivalent to the ones of the model of section 2 .",
    "the present model has infinitely many symmetries and infinitely many conserved currents , like the one of section 2 .",
    "further , the generalized zero curvature representation does not exist for the full model , but only for a submodel defined by the additional condition ( [ perp - cond ] ) , again in complete analogy with the model of section 2 .",
    "another simple modification which allows for compactons in three spatial dimensions is given by the lagrangian @xmath112 here , the term @xmath113 is just the lagrangian of the cp@xmath114 model .",
    "the above lagrangian contains one quartic term and one quadratic term in first derivatives , and so may have finite energy solutions in three dimensions , according to the derrick scaling argument .",
    "it is , however , not scale invariant nor does it have infinitely many symmetries , in contrast to the models studied above .",
    "therefore , we do not expect to find fully analytical solutions in this case , see below .",
    "+ we again use the ansatz @xmath115 , @xmath116 in spherical polar coordinates in three space dimensions . with this ansatz , the coupling function @xmath117",
    "may again be eliminated from the field equation for @xmath4 , and this equation is , therefore , just the field equation of the cp@xmath114 model on base space @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest solution of this equation is @xmath118 the cp@xmath114 energy density of this solution is @xmath119 there exist many more solutions of the cp@xmath114 model like , e.g. , higher powers of the simplest solution , but the corresponding energy densities are no longer independent of the angular coordinates .",
    "these higher solutions are , therefore , not compatible with our separation ansatz @xmath120 , and we have to restrict to the simplest solution ( [ simp - sol ] ) in what follows . for this simplest cp@xmath114 solution , we find the following euler  lagrange equation for @xmath103 @xmath121 or , after the variable transformation @xmath122 @xmath123 this equation differs from the previous ones by the explicit presence of the factor @xmath124 ( the independent variable ) in the second term , that is , it is no longer an autonomous equation . as expected , we were not able to find analytic solutions to this equation , so we will resort to a qualitative analysis and to a numerical study in the sequel .",
    "further , we shall find that its solutions are no longer topological and may , therefore , have arbitrarily small energies . + concretely , a numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ s - eq ] ) leads to the following results :    * there do not exist shell - type solutions . if one starts the integration at an inner boundary @xmath125 with @xmath126 taking one vacuum value ( e.g. @xmath127 ) , and @xmath128 , then the integration into the direction @xmath129 never reaches the other vacuum value @xmath130 . instead",
    ", a point @xmath131 is reached where @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and at this point @xmath134 becomes singular ( it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ s - eq ] ) that at a point where @xmath135 , either @xmath3 must take one of its vacuum values , or @xmath136 becomes singular ) .",
    "* there exist , however , solutions of the ball type .",
    "if one starts the numerical integration at an outer compacton boundary ( e.g. , with @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) and integrates towards @xmath139 , then the integration will simply hit the point @xmath140 .",
    "in order to see that the resulting solution is an acceptable compacton , it is more useful to reverse the integration and to start at @xmath140 .",
    "* let us assume that we start the integration at @xmath140 with some value @xmath141 and with @xmath142 .",
    "first , we observe that due to the suppression factor @xmath124 in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ s - eq ] ) , @xmath143 and @xmath144 may take arbitrary values without making @xmath145 singular ( concretely , if @xmath146 then @xmath147 ) . for @xmath148",
    ", we note that for @xmath149 it holds that @xmath150 , whereas for @xmath151 it holds that @xmath152 , as follows easily from eq .",
    "( [ s - eq ] ) . *",
    "therefore , with the initial conditions given above , the following picture emerges for an integration starting at @xmath140 .",
    "if @xmath153 is too large , then the integration curve for @xmath134 will cross the line @xmath76 and then grow forever , producing a formal solution with infinite energy . if @xmath154 is too small , the integration curve will reach a point @xmath155 where @xmath156 but still @xmath157 . at this point",
    "the integration curve becomes singular , because @xmath158 is singular .",
    "it follows that there exists a fine tuned value @xmath159 for the integration constant @xmath160 such that the integration curve touches the line @xmath76 instead of crossing it , that is , it reaches the value @xmath132 precisely at the point @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "this configuration is the compacton .",
    "the above qualitative discussion is completely confirmed by an explicit numerical integration .    in the above argument",
    ", we could start the integration at @xmath140 for an arbitrary value @xmath163 . by choosing a @xmath143 arbitrarily close to the value @xmath164 we can",
    ", therefore , make the size and the energy of the compacton arbitrarily small .",
    "these compactons are , therefore , no longer topological .",
    "this makes their stability under time - dependent perturbations more problematic ( a detailed stability analysis is beyond the scope of the present letter ) .",
    "+ _ remark : _ we chose the coupling function @xmath165 as the simplest representative of a class of coupling functions with ( at least ) two vacuum values in order to allow for topological compactons . in the last example , however , the compactons are not topological in any case , therefore the presence of more than one vacuum in the coupling function is not necessary in this case .",
    "+ _ remark : _ in the above discussion about the integration from the center @xmath140 we restricted to the interval @xmath141 just for reasons of simplicity .",
    "it presents no difficulty to extend the discussion and to cover cases where @xmath3 starts outside this interval at @xmath140 . for an adequately fine - tuned value of @xmath166 there",
    "always exists a compacton .",
    "we plot two typical compact ball solutions in figures 1 and 2 . here in figure 1",
    "@xmath3 starts at @xmath167 whereas in figure 2 it starts at @xmath168 .",
    "the qualitative discussion above is completely confirmed by the numerical solutions shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "in this paper , we found analytic solutions for compact solitons of the shell type in 3 + 1 and 4 + 1-dimensional @xmath1 field theories . to our knowledge , these are the first examples of compactons in @xmath1 field theories in those dimensions .",
    "the topology of these shell type compactons is quite interesting , being a combination of the topology of the complex field @xmath4 which lives on a compact base space ( @xmath2 or @xmath5 , respectively ) and is classified by the homotopy of maps from that base space to the target space @xmath2 , and of the topology of the real field @xmath3 which lives on the positive real line ( radial coordinate ) , and where the topology is induced by the boundary conditions implied by the finiteness of the energy .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the skyrme model , which has exactly the same field contents and the same topology .",
    "the main difference is the quartic kinetic term of the real scalar field @xmath3 in the models discussed in the present paper .",
    "further , we were able to find an infinite number of exact compacton solutions in both cases , labelled by an integer @xmath100 .",
    "the existence of these infinitely many analytical solutions is probably related to the infinitely many symmetries and infinitely many conserved currents , which are present in both models , as typically happens in models with infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "we also investigated the integrability properties of these two models and found that , although they have infinitely many conservation laws , they do not possess a generalized zero curvature representation , but a submodel defined by a further constraint equation does . in this sense , these models seem to be half way between integrable and non - integrable .",
    "+ finally we investigated a model without infinitely many symmetries , and without the scale symmetry of the models discussed above .",
    "this model does not allow for analytical solutions , but it is not difficult to find solutions numerically .",
    "it turns out that this model does not have solutions of the shell type .",
    "it does , however , possess compact solutions of the ball type , but these solutions are no longer topological solitons .",
    "the real scalar field @xmath3 may , in fact , take values on arbitrarily small intervals @xmath169 $ ] of the real axis ( here @xmath170 is the starting value at zero radius , and 1 is the vacuum value ) , so the full target space may be an arbitrary segment of @xmath5 . consequently , there exist compact balls with arbitrary size and energy . +",
    "as stated , it has been the main purpose of the present paper to establish the existence of compactons in @xmath1 field theories in higher dimensions , and to study their properties . in the case of the shells the underlying theories are scale invariant , and",
    "the dynamical generation of a scale ( the compacton size ) is by itself an important result in relativistic field theory .",
    "nevertheless , we want to discuss briefly some possible applications and further directions of investigation .",
    "as already mentioned , compactons in low ( i.e. 1 + 1 ) dimensions have been applied to brane cosmology , where the compacton acts as a domain wall such that the confinement of both gravity and field fluctuations to the domain wall ( `` thick brane '' ) is an automatic consequence of the field equations .",
    "recently , compact solutions of the @xmath171-ball type and of the @xmath171-shell type have been found in certain higher ( i.e. 3 + 1 dimensional ) gauge theories with normal kinetic terms and v - shaped potential ( for the scalar field ) , @xcite .",
    "further , in ref .",
    "@xcite the coupling of these compact @xmath171 balls and @xmath171 shells to gravity has been investigated in detail by the use of numerical methods .",
    "it was found there that the @xmath171 balls may form stable self - gravitating solutions , whereas the @xmath171 shells may not only form self - gravitating @xmath171 shells but may also dress black holes ( i.e. may contain a schwarzschild interior ) .",
    "this whole analysis is complicated by the fact that the basic solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite are ( time dependent ) @xmath171 balls and @xmath171 shells rather than static solitons ( e.g. the asymptotic metric is kerr rather than schwarzschild ) .",
    "therefore , the coupling of the solutions of the present paper ( or of related solutions of comparable simplicity ) to gravity should lead to a simpler analysis of the problem of gravitational self - coupling and probably even allow for mainly analytical calculations .",
    "this question is under current investigation .",

    "<S> the lagrangian of these models is given by a scalar field with a non - standard kinetic term ( @xmath1 field ) coupled to a pure skyrme term restricted to @xmath2 , rised to the appropriate power to avoid the derrick scaling argument . </S>",
    "<S> further , the existence of infinitely many exact shell solitons is explained using the generalized integrability approach . </S>",
