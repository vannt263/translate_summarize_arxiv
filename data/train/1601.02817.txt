    "we analyse the problem of controllability for linear finite - dimensional systems submitted to parametrised perturbations , depending on unknown parameters in a deterministic manner .",
    "in previous works we have analysed the property of averaged control looking for a control , independent of the values of these parameters , designed to perform well , in an averaged sense ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "here we analyse the complementary issue of determining the most relevant values of the unknown parameters so to provide the best possible approximation of the set of parameter - depending controls .",
    "our analysis is based on previous work on greedy and weak greedy algorithms for parameter - depending pdes and abstract equations in banach spaces ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which we adapt to the present context .",
    "although the greedy control is applicable to more general control problems and systems , here we concentrate on controllability issues and , to better illustrate the main ideas of the new approach , we focus on linear finite - dimensional systems of parameter - dependent odes .",
    "infinite - dimensional systems , as a first attempt to later consider pde models , are discussed separately in section [ infinite ] , as well as in the conclusion section .",
    "consider the finite dimensional linear control system @xmath0    in ( [ eq1f - d ] ) the ( column ) vector valued function @xmath1 is the state of the system , @xmath2 is a @xmath3matrix governing its free dynamics and @xmath4 is a @xmath5-component control vector in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , entering and acting on the system through the control operator @xmath8 , a @xmath9 parameter - dependent matrix . in the sequel , to simplify the notation , @xmath10 will be simply denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are assumed to be lipschitz continuous with respect to the parameter @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 being a compact set . however , some of our analytical results ( section [ infinite ] ) will additionally require analytic dependence conditions on @xmath17 .    here , to simplify the presentation ,",
    "we have assumed the initial datum @xmath18 to be controlled , to be independent of the parameter @xmath17 . despite of this ,",
    "the matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 being @xmath17-dependent , both the control and the solution will depend on @xmath17 .",
    "similar arguments allow to handle the case when @xmath19 also depends on the parameter @xmath17 , which will be discussed separately .",
    "we address the controllability of this system whose initial datum @xmath19 is given , known and fully determined .",
    "we assume that the system under consideration is controllable for all values of @xmath17 .",
    "this can be ensured to hold , for instance , assuming that the controllability condition is satisfied for some specific realisation @xmath20 and that the variations of @xmath2 and @xmath8 with respect to @xmath17 are small enough .    in these circumstances , for each value of @xmath17 there is a control of minimal @xmath21^m$]-norm , @xmath22 .",
    "this defines a map , @xmath23^m$ ] , whose regularity is determined by that of the matrices entering in the system , @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "here we are interested on the problem of determining the optimal selection of a finite number of realisations of the parameter @xmath17 so that all controls , for all possible values of @xmath17 , are optimally approximated .",
    "more precisely , the problem can be formulated as follows .",
    "* problem 1 *    _ given a control time @xmath24 and arbitrary initial data @xmath19 and final target @xmath25 , we consider the set of controls of minimal @xmath21^m$]-norm , @xmath26 , corresponding to all possible values @xmath27 of the parameter satisfying the controllability condition : @xmath28 this set of controls is compact in @xmath21^m$ ] .",
    "_    given @xmath29 we aim at determining a family of parameters @xmath30 in @xmath16 , whose cardinal @xmath31 depends on @xmath32 , so that the corresponding controls , denoted by @xmath33 , are such that for every @xmath27 there exists @xmath34 steering the system in time @xmath35 within the @xmath32 distance from the target @xmath36 , i. e. such that @xmath37    here and in the sequel , in order to simplify the notation , we denote by @xmath38 the control @xmath22 , and similarly we use the simplified notation @xmath39 .    note that , in practice , the controllability condition ( [ eq2f - d ] ) is relaxed to the approximate one ( [ eq2f - dap ] ) .",
    "this is so since , in practical applications , when performing numerical approximations , one is interested in achieving the targets within a given error .",
    "this fact is also intrinsic to the methods we employ and develop in this paper , and that can only yield optimal procedures to compute approximations of the exact control , which turn out to be approximate controls in the sense of ( [ eq2f - dap ] ) .",
    "this problem is motivated by the practical issue of avoiding the construction of a control function @xmath38 for each new parameter value @xmath17 which , for large systems , although theoretically feasible by the uniform controllability assumption , would be computationally expensive . by the contrary",
    ", the methods we develop try to exploit the advantages that a suitable choice of the most representative values of @xmath17 provides when computing rapidly the approximation of the control for any other value of @xmath17 , ensuring that the system is steered to the target within the given error ( [ eq2f - dap ] ) .",
    "of course , the compactness of the parameter set @xmath16 and the lipschitz - dependence assumption with respect to @xmath17 make the goal to be feasible .",
    "it would suffice , for instance , to apply a _ naive _ approach , by taking a fine enough uniform mesh on @xmath16 to achieve the goal . however , our aim is to minimise the number of spanning controls @xmath31 and to derive the most efficient approximation .",
    "the _ naive _ approach is not suitable in this respect .    to achieve this goal we adapt to the present frame of finite - dimensional control , the theory developed in recent years based on greedy and weak - greedy algorithms for parameter dependent pdes or abstract equations in banach spaces , which optimise the dimension of the approximating space , as well as the number of steps required for its construction .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ control - prel ]",
    "we summarise the needed controllability results for finite - dimensional systems and reformulate problem 1 in terms of the corresponding gramian operator .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the review of ( weak ) greedy algorithms , while their application to the control problem under consideration and its solution is provided in the subsequent section .",
    "the computational cost of the greedy control approach is analysed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains a generalisation of the approach to infinite dimensional problems followed by a convergence analysis of the greedy approximation errors with respect to the dimension of the approximating space .",
    "section 7 contains numerical examples and experiments for finite - difference discretisations of 1-d wave and heat problems .",
    "the paper is closed pointing towards future development lines of the greedy control approach .",
    "in order to develop the analysis in this paper it is necessary to derive a convenient characterisation of the control of minimal norm @xmath38 , as a function of the parameter @xmath17 . this can be done in a straightforward manner in terms of the gramian operator . in this section",
    "we briefly summarise the most basic material on finite - dimensional systems that will be used along this article ( we refer to @xcite for more details ) .",
    "consider the finite - dimensional system of dimension @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath40-dimensional state and @xmath43 is the @xmath5-dimensional control , with @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to a specific realisation of the system above for a given choice of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we omit however the presence of @xmath17 from the notation since we are now considering a generic linear finite - dimensional system .",
    "here @xmath12 is an @xmath44 matrix with constant real coefficients and @xmath13 is an @xmath45 matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath12 determines the dynamics of the system and the matrix @xmath13 models the way @xmath5 controls act on it .    in practice , it is desirable to control the @xmath40 components of the system with a low number of controls , the best possible case being the one of scalar controls : @xmath46 .    recall that system ( [ fd ] ) is said to be _ controllable _ when every initial datum @xmath47 can be driven to any final datum @xmath36 in @xmath48 in time @xmath35 .",
    "this controllability property can be characterised by a necessary and sufficient condition , which is of purely algebraic nature , the so called _ kalman condition _ : system ( [ fd ] ) is controllable if and only if @xmath49=n.\\ ] ]    when this rank condition is fulfilled the system is controllable for all @xmath24 .",
    "there is a direct proof of this result which uses the representation of solutions of ( [ fd ] ) by means of the variations of constants formula .",
    "but for our purpose it is more convenient to use the point of view based on the dual problem of observability of the adjoint system that we discuss now .",
    "consider the _ adjoint system _",
    "@xmath50    system ( [ fd ] ) is controllable in time @xmath35 if and only if the adjoint system ( [ afd ] ) is _ observable _ in time @xmath35 , i. e. if there exists a constant @xmath51 such that , for all solution @xmath52 of ( [ afd ] ) , latexmath:[\\[\\label{fdoi }     hold in all time @xmath35 if and only if the kalman rank condition ( [ rc ] ) is satisfied .",
    "furthermore , the control of minimal @xmath21^m$]-norm can be built as a minimiser of a quadratic functional @xmath54 : @xmath55 more precisely , if @xmath56 is a minimiser for @xmath57 , then the control @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the corresponding solution of ( [ afd ] ) , is such that the state @xmath42 of ( [ fd ] ) satisfies the control requirement @xmath60 .",
    "note that the minimiser of @xmath54 exists since the functional @xmath57 is continuous , quadratic and coercive , in view of the observability inequality .",
    "this characterisation of controls ensuring controllability also yields explicit bounds on the controls .",
    "indeed , since the functional @xmath61 at the minimiser , and in view of the observability inequality ( [ fdoi ] ) , it follows that @xmath62^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath63 being the same constant as in ( [ fdoi ] ) .",
    "therefore , we see that the square root of the observability constant is , up to a multiplicative factor , the norm of the control map associating to the data the control of minimal norm .",
    "summarising , the control of minimal @xmath21^m$]-norm is of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath56 being the minimiser of @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath66 be the quadratic form , known as ( controllability ) gramian , associated to the pair @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 with @xmath69 being solutions to with the data @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . then , under the rank condition , because of the observability inequality , this operator is coercive and symmetric and therefore invertible .",
    "its corresponding matrix , which we denote the same , is given by the relation @xmath72    the minimiser @xmath56 can be expressed as the solution to the linear system @xmath73 hereby , the left hand side , up to the free dynamics component , represents the solution of the control system ( [ fd ] ) with the control given by .",
    "as the solution is steered to the target @xmath36 , the last relation follows .    in our context",
    "the adjoint system depends also on the parameter @xmath17 : @xmath74 we assume that the system under consideration is controllable for all values of @xmath17 .",
    "this can be ensured to hold assuming the following uniform controllability condition @xmath75 where @xmath76 are positive constants , while @xmath77 is the gramian of the system determined by @xmath78 .",
    "as we mentioned above , this assumption is fulfilled , in particular , as soon as the system is controllable for some specific value of the parameter @xmath79 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 depend continuously on @xmath17 , and @xmath17 is close enough to @xmath20 .",
    "but our discussion and presentation makes sense in the more general setting where ( [ g - bound ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "as we restrict the analysis to the set of minimal @xmath80^m$]-norm controls , each such control can be uniquely determined by the relation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the unique minimiser of a quadratic functional @xmath83 given by , with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath84 , and @xmath85 by @xmath86 , the solution to .",
    "as explained above , the minimiser @xmath82 can be equivalently determined as the solution to the system @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the gramian associated to @xmath89 .    according to the uniform controllability condition",
    ", this defines a mapping @xmath90 , whose smoothness is transferred from the mappings of @xmath91 and @xmath84 at all levels : lipschitz , analytic etc .",
    "having assumed these maps are lipschitz continuous and the parameter @xmath27 varies on a compact set , the set of minimisers @xmath92 constitutes also a compact set in @xmath48 .    by using the 1 - 1 correspondence between the controls @xmath38 and the associated minimisers @xmath82 ,",
    "the original problem formulation can be reduced to the following one .",
    "* problem 2 * _ given a control time @xmath24 , an arbitrary initial data @xmath19 , final target @xmath25 , and @xmath29 , and taking into account that the set of minimisers @xmath92 corresponding to all possible values @xmath27 of the parameter is compact in @xmath48 , we aim at determining a family of parameters @xmath93 in @xmath16 so that the corresponding minimisers , that we denote by @xmath94 , are such that for every @xmath27 there exists @xmath95 such that the control @xmath96 given by , with @xmath97 replaced by @xmath98 , steers the system to the state @xmath99 within the @xmath32 distance from the target @xmath36 . _    in this formulation the elements of the manifold we want to approximate are @xmath40-dimensional vectors ( instead of @xmath100^m$]-functions in the first formulation ) , uniquely determined as solutions to linear systems .",
    "this enables to adapt the ( weak ) greedy algorithms and reduced bases methods for parameter dependent problems , that we present in the following section .",
    "the approximate controls we obtain in this manner do not really belong to the space @xmath101 spanned by controls associated to selected parameter values , since the selection is done at the level of @xmath102 , the control being simply the natural one corresponding to the choice of @xmath103 .",
    "in this section we present a brief introduction and main results of the linear approximation theory of parametric problems based on the ( weak ) greedy algorithms , that we shall use in our application to controllability problems .",
    "a more exhaustive overview can be found in some recent papers , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the goal is to approximate a compact set @xmath104 in a banach space @xmath105 by a sequence of finite dimensional subspaces @xmath106 of dimension @xmath31 . by increasing @xmath31 one improves the accuracy of the approximation .    determining _ offline _ an approximation subspace within a given error normally implies a high computational effort .",
    "however , this calculation is performed only once , resulting in a good subspace from which one can easily and computationally cheaply construct _ online _ approximations to every vector from @xmath104 .",
    "vectors @xmath107 spanning the space @xmath106 are called _ snapshots _ of @xmath104 .",
    "the goal of ( weak ) greedy algorithms is to construct a family of finite dimensional spaces @xmath108 that approximate the set @xmath104 in the best possible manner .",
    "the algorithm is structured as follows .    *",

    "+    the algorithm produces a finite dimensional space @xmath106 that approximates the set @xmath104 within the given tolerance @xmath32 .",
    "the choice of a new element @xmath118 in each step is not unique , neither is the sequence of approximation rates @xmath119 .",
    "but every such a chosen sequence decays at the same rate , which under certain assumptions given below , is close to the optimal one .",
    "thus the algorithm optimises the number of steps required in order to satisfy the given tolerance , as well as the dimension of the final space @xmath106 .",
    "the pure greedy algorithm corresponds to the case @xmath120 . as we shall see below",
    ", the relaxation of the pure greedy method ( @xmath120 ) to a weak greedy one ( @xmath109 ) will not significantly reduce the efficiency of the algorithm , making it , by the contrary , much easier for implementation .    when performing the ( weak ) greedy algorithm one has to chose the next element of the approximation space by exploring the distance for all possible values @xmath121 .",
    "such approach is faced with two crucial obstacles :    * the set @xmath104 in general consists of infinitely many vectors . * in practical implementations",
    "the set @xmath104 is often unknown ( e.g. it represents the family of solutions to parameter dependent problems ) .",
    "the first problem is bypassed by performing a search over some finite discrete subset of @xmath104 .",
    "here we use the fact that @xmath104 , being a compact set , can be covered by a finite number of balls of an arbitrary small radius .    as to deal with the second one , instead of considering the exact distance appearing in , one uses some _ surrogate _ , easier to compute .    in order to estimate the efficiency of the weak greedy algorithm we compare its approximation rates @xmath119 with the best possible ones .",
    "the best choice of a approximating space @xmath106 is the one producing the smallest approximation error .",
    "this smallest error for a compact set @xmath104 is called the _ kolmogorov @xmath31-width of @xmath104 _ , and is defined as @xmath122 it measures how well @xmath104 can be approximated by a subspace in @xmath105 of a fixed dimension @xmath31 .    in the sequel",
    "we want to compare @xmath119 with the kolmogorov width @xmath123 , which represents the best possible approximation of @xmath104 by a @xmath31 dimensional subspace of the referent banach space @xmath105 .",

    "in addition , it is also remarkable that the constant @xmath124 effects the efficiency only up to a multiplicative constant , while leaving approximation rates unchanged .",
    "in this section we solve problem 2 implementing the ( weak ) greedy algorithm in the manifold @xmath130 consisting of minimisers determined by the relation .",
    "the * goal * is to choose @xmath31 parameters such that @xmath131 approximates the whole manifold @xmath92 within the given error @xmath32 .    to this effect ,",
    "as already stated in the introduction , we assume that the matrices @xmath2 and @xmath132 are lipschitz continuous with respect to the parameter . in turn , this implies that the mapping @xmath133 possesses the same regularity as well , with the lipschitz constant denoted by @xmath134 .",
    "the greedy selection of each new snapshot relies on the relation , which in this setting maximises the distance of elements of @xmath92 from the space spanned by already chosen snapshots .",
    "theoretically , this process requires that we solve for each value of @xmath17 . and",
    "this is exactly what we want to avoid .",
    "actually , here we face the obstacle _ ii ) _ from previous section , since one has to apply the greedy algorithm within a set whose elements are not given explicitly .",
    "the problem is managed by identifying an appropriate surrogate for the unknown distances @xmath136 . to this effect note that @xmath137 where @xmath138 , while @xmath139 denotes equivalence of terms resulting from the uniform controllability assumption .",

    "_ waves versus heat : _ in our numerical experiments we have observed that the greedy algorithm is more efficient for the semi - discrete heat equation than for the wave one , in the sense that for the first one it stops after @xmath385 iterations while for the second one it goes up to @xmath371 .",
    "this is a natural result to be expected . indeed , for the heat equation , because of the intrinsic dissipativity of the system , the high frequency components play a minor role when , as in our experiments , dealing with approximate controllability .",
    "thus , even if the algebraic dimension of both systems , waves and heat , are the same , in practice the relevant dimensions for the heat equation is much smaller , thus explaining the faster convergence of the greedy algorithm for heat like equations . * _ extension of greedy control to pde systems .",
    "_ as we have seen the methods and ideas developed in this paper can be easily adapted to infinite - dimensional odes .",
    "the same ideas and methods can be implemented without major changes on the pde setting .",
    "however , as we have seen above , in order to quantify the convergence rate of greedy algorithms , the analytic dependence of the controls with respect to parameters plays a key role .",
    "as far as we know , this issue has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature , i.e. that of whether or not controls for a given pde controllability problem depend analytically on the parameters entering in the system . and at this level , the type of pde under consideration can play a major role . indeed , for heat equations ,",
    "even when the unknown parameters enter in the principal part of the diffusion operator , the analytic dependence of the controls can be expected .",
    "this is not the case for wave equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , note that even for the simplest first order transport equation solutions fail to depend analytically on the velocity of propagation in a natural @xmath353 or sobolev energy setting .",
    "this issue requires significant further investigation . *",
    "robust control .",
    "_ the analysis and methods developed in this paper apply to control problems where the data to be controlled are prescribed a priori , either depending on the parameters or not . in that sense , our results are the analogue to what has been done for the greedy approximation of pde solutions with given data ( right hand side terms and boundary values ) as in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "+ from the point of view of applications it would be interesting to develop greedy methods for control of potential application for all possible data to be controlled .",
    "this would require to establish a strategy for identifying the most relevant snapshots of the parameters @xmath17 for the approximation of the gramians @xmath386 , within the space of bounded linear operators . and",
    "this , in turn , requires identifying efficient surrogates .",
    "this is an interesting problem to be addressed .",
    "+ actually , as far as we know , this has not been done even in the context of the solvability of elliptic problems .",
    "the work done so far , as mentioned above , addresses approximation issues for given specific data .",
    "but the problem of applying greedy algorithms to approximate the resolvent operators , in a robust manner and independently of the data entering in the pde , has not been addressed .                                            , ( 2006 ) .",
