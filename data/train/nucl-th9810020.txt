    "over the last several decades , the standard model of weak interactions has been thoroughly tested by a vast amount of data for leptonic and semi- leptonic decays and reactions .",
    "hadronic weak interactions are in general more difficult to study experimentally since they are usually obscured by the presence of the much larger strong interaction .",
    "this requires employing processes in which the strong force can not participate due to overriding symmetry principles . in the case of the weak nucleon - nucleon interaction",
    "it was realized more than 40 years ago@xcite that the current - current form of the weak interaction dictates the presence of a weak transition between nucleons which would lead to parity impurities in nuclear states which are of first order in the weak coupling .",
    "using these parity nonconserving observables in many experiments on nuclear gamma and alpha transitions , polarized @xmath2 scattering , as well as the recent first measurement of the nuclear anapole moment@xcite , much has been learned about the weak nucleon - nucleon interaction@xcite .",
    "the situation is very different for the flavor - changing baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "soon after the discovery of hypernuclei it was recognized that the @xmath5 inside the nuclear medium decays not through its pauli - blocked mesonic decay channel , but predominantly through the @xmath11 = 1 nonmesonic transition @xmath12 , thus opening a door to the study of the weak strangeness - changing hyperon - nucleon force .",
    "however , experimental progress in this field of weak hypernuclear decays has been slow until recently due to the difficult multi - coincidence , low count - rate nature of these measurements . in recent years",
    "the situation has improved significantly due to a series of new experiments at bnl and kek . on the theoretical side it became clear that in order to unambiguously extract the weak @xmath12 transition potential significant effort",
    "must be spent to account for the nuclear structure effects as accurately as possible .",
    "when this task was recently completed@xcite it became apparent that major discrepancies between theory and experiment can not be due to the underlying nuclear structure but have to arise from the nature of the weak transition potential itself .",
    "even with the nuclear structure input under control it has become desirable to measure the process @xmath0 directly since the hypernuclear decay can only probe the reaction at one well - defined kinematic setting . though considered impossible for many years since",
    "this process is reduced in cross section by around 12 orders of magnitude from the standard elastic @xmath2 scattering , recent progress in experimental and accelerator technology may have brought measuring this process within reach @xcite .",
    "it is therefore timely to provide predictions of various observables based on the transition potential used in the nonmesonic hypernuclear decay .    in sec .",

    "the effect of the @xmath2 interaction is to reduce the cross section by a factor of about 2 .",
    "the reduction is a result of the fact that the @xmath85 pair moves with large relative momentum ( from @xmath87 mev / c to @xmath88 mev / c ) in the range of proton lab momenta explored and feels the effect of the strong repulsive short range part of the @xmath2 interaction . as a consequence , the @xmath85 wave function",

    "when compared to the thin line , one observes a substantial enhancement of the cross section in the low momentum region which turns into a moderate reduction at high lab momentum values .",
    "this is due to the fact that , close to threshold , the @xmath83 pair moves with small relative momentum , feeling the attractive component of the @xmath3 potential . as a result",
    "the wave function gets pushed in to smaller distances and the cross section is enhanced . as the proton lab momentum increases ,",
    "so does the relative @xmath89 momentum and , eventually , the repulsive core of the @xmath3 interaction becomes responsible for reducing the wave function at short distances , giving rise to smaller cross sections .",
    "the opening of the @xmath90 channel , coupled to the @xmath91 one through the strong interaction , shows up as a step in the cross section at a proton lab momentum around @xmath92 mev / c .",

    "[ fig : fig2]a we see that adding the @xmath93 meson to one - pion - exchange considerably reduces the cross section in the kinematic region studied here .",
    "including the remaining mesons does not change the cross section much , which ends up being about a factor 2 smaller than that for one - pion only .",
    "this effect appears to be surprisingly different from the moderate reduction of 15% found for the decay rate of hypernuclei when the effect of adding heavier mesons to the one - pion - exchange mechanism was studied @xcite .",
    "however , we point out that the @xmath26 correlations in the weak hypernuclear decay case were obtained from a g - matrix calculation which takes into account the pauli principle acting on the intermediate nucleon .",
    "this blocks the low relative momentum transitions between the initial @xmath26 and intermediate @xmath3 states and , therefore , the effect of the attractive part of the interaction on the correlated @xmath26 wave function is much reduced compared to those of the distorted @xmath89 wave function in free space .",
    "thus , the @xmath26 wave function in the hypernucleus is strongly suppressed at small distances , making the contribution of the heavier mesons less important .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b , the use of the bonn b @xmath2 and jlich a @xmath26 potentials give rise to different effects in the cross section as compared to those calculated using the nijmegen ones .",
    "although not shown in the figures , we have checked that , in the absence of @xmath89 distortions , the cross section calculated with the distorted @xmath94 waves , obtained from either the nijmegen 93 or the bonn b potentials , yield nearly identical results .",
    "therefore , the differences between the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a and  [ fig : fig2]b come almost completely from the different models used to distort the @xmath83 final state . already at the level of only pion - exchange ( dashed line in fig .",

    "we note here that the pion - only cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is close to the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite with one - pion - exchange , but we do not find the tremendous enhancement of a factor of 3 in the cross section when the @xmath93 meson is included .",
    "this is most likely due to the different models for the weak @xmath96 vertices used in the @xmath93-exchange mechanism .",
    "their weak coupling constants are larger than the ones used here by a factor of more than 2 for the parity conserving ones ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) and a factor 3.5 for the parity violating one ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "let us now explore the origin of the peak in the cross section around the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "nuclear matter calculations already showed some time ago @xcite that , while the @xmath5 binding energy in nuclear matter turned out to be about @xmath100 to @xmath101 mev for the nijmegen and jlich interactions , the distribution of this strength between the various partial waves was very different .",
    "the most important contribution for the jlich interactions came from the coupled @xmath102 channel , the @xmath103 contribution being negligible .",
    "however , the nijmegen interactions obtained almost equal contributions from both the @xmath104 and @xmath105 channels . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we analyze the contribution to the @xmath106 cross section from @xmath102 partial waves obtained from the nijmegen ( fig .  [",

    "the short dashed lines represent cross sections obtained by removing the @xmath108 component of the distorted @xmath83 wave function and the long - dashed lines those obtained when the @xmath109 component is removed .",
    "the thin solid line shows the small cross sections obtained when all the @xmath102 coupled channel is omitted , thus reflecting the fact that these are the most important components for the @xmath110 reaction , as already noted in ref .",
    "the stronger @xmath102 channel of the jlich interaction , relative to the nijmegen one , is the reason for the much more enhanced cross section at the @xmath111 threshold . suppressing the @xmath103 partial waves",

    "[ fig : fig3]a and  [ fig : fig3]b . in spite of the fact that the nijmegen @xmath3 interaction has a sizable @xmath103 component , its contribution to the cross section",

    "the dashed line is the result for the pion - only calculation , the thin solid line shows the effect of including the @xmath93 meson and the thick solid line incorporates the full set of six mesons .",
    "the effect of adding the rho to the pion is a reduction of a factor slightly more than 2 while adding all mesons brings the results closer to the one - pion ones , as observed earlier for the total cross section .    a measure of the amount of parity violation in the weak @xmath5 production is given by the asymmetry @xmath114 defined as @xmath115 where @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) is the cross section for positive ( negative ) helicity of the incoming proton . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we consider the one - pion - exchange mechanism in the weak @xmath13 transition and illustrate the effect of the strong distortions on the asymmtery a using the nijmegen models for the @xmath2 and @xmath26 interactions .",
    "the dashed line shows the asymmetry when neither the form factors at the vertices nor the strong distortions are included .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath2 interactions , as shown by the thin solid line , decrease the value of the asymmetry up to a beam momentum of 1130 mev / c beyond which it increases compared to the dashed line .",
    "the addition of the @xmath26 final state interaction gives rise to the particular cusp structure due to the opening of the @xmath90 channel around 1140 mev / c .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] where the @xmath2 and @xmath26 distorted waves have been generated with the bonn b and jlich a models , respectively .",
    "we observe that while the @xmath93 meson increases the asymmetry with respect to the pion - only result , the inclusion of all the six mesons produces an asymmetry which is considerably smaller .",
    "similar qualitative features are found when the nijmegen potential models are used in constructing the distorted @xmath2 and @xmath26 waves .    finally , we present in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig7]a and  [ fig : fig7]b the @xmath13 cross sections and asymmetries , respectively , obtained with the full meson - exchange weak transition potential for three different strong interaction models .",

    "it is clear that these strong @xmath3 potentials are not sufficiently constrained by the small amount of total cross section data on @xmath3 scattering .",
    "hence the different @xmath3 models which produce the total cross sections for @xmath3 scattering equally well , give rise to very different predictions when applied to other reactions that are sensitive to the @xmath3 interaction , like hypernuclear structure calculations , studies of nuclear matter with strangeness , or the weak transition @xmath13 studied here .",
    "more data on @xmath3 scattering , especially on differential cross sections and polarization observables , is highly desirable in order to constraint the @xmath3 interactions sufficiently well so that the @xmath106 reaction can be used to learn about the weak four fermion interaction .",

    "the total cross sections are sensitive to the model ingredients of the weak transition operator . including the @xmath93 meson decreases the pion - only cross sections by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "the effect of the remaining mesons depends on the strong potentials employed to distort the @xmath83 states , giving rise to cross sections that can be either very close or a factor 2 smaller than the pion - only results .",
    "the kinematical region explored by the free @xmath120 reaction is much larger than that by the inverse reaction , the nonmesonic decay @xmath121 taking place inside hypernuclei .",
    "the heavier mesons contribute very differently and are more important in the free reaction compared to the nonmesonic decay due to the different behavior of the @xmath26 wave function inside a hypernucleus compared to that in free space .    the total cross section computed with the nijmegen @xmath26 wave functions",
    "show a step - like behavior around 1140 mev / c beam momentum , where the strong @xmath122 transition opens up .",
    "the jlich @xmath26 results show a dramatic peak in this region .",

    "<S> the weak production of lambdas in nucleon - nucleon scattering is studied in a meson - exchange framework . the weak transition operator for the @xmath0 reaction is identical to a previously developed weak strangeness - changing transition potential @xmath1 that describes the nonmesonic decay of hypernuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the initial @xmath2 and final @xmath3 state interaction has been included by using realistic baryon - baryon forces that describe the available elastic scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> the total and differential cross sections as well as the parity - violating asymmetry are studied for the reaction pn @xmath4 p@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these observables are found to be sensitive to the opening of the @xmath6 production channel , the choice of the strong interaction potential and the structure of the weak transition potential .    </S>",
