    "effects of interchain coupling in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) magnets have been extensively investigated over many years .",
    "theoretically , introduction of an infinitesimal interchain coupling can bring a drastic change to the system ; emergence of a thermal phase transition and long - range magnetic order therewith at finite temperatures . in interpreting experimental results on q1d materials , which mostly exhibit anomalous behavior at finite temperatures , one often has to take the interchain effects into account as well . a standard and",
    "established approach for incorporating such a weak interchain interaction is the chain mean - field ( cmf ) approximation,@xcite in which a problem in two or three dimensions is reduced to a single - chain model in an effective field by ignoring fluctuations of order parameter between weakly coupled chains . within the cmf theory ,",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of a q1d system is approximated as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the susceptibility of a _ genuinely one - dimensional _ chain , @xmath4 the coordination number , i.e. , the number of nearest neighbor sites in directions perpendicular to the chain , and @xmath5 is the interchain coupling constant in these directions .",
    "since @xmath3 may not have any singularity at finite temperatures , the critical temperature @xmath6 of the q1d system is given as the locus of the simple pole in the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cmf - chi ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath7 is the equation which determines the q1d critical temperature .",
    "it has been confirmed that for various q1d ( and also q2d ) materials the solution of the cmf self - consistent equation  ( [ eqn : cmf - tc ] ) reproduces a qualitatively acceptable @xmath5-dependence of the critical temperature in the weak interchain coupling regime .",
    "recently , yasuda _ _ et al.__@xcite carefully reexamined the nel temperature of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets on a anisotropic cubic lattice , and found that eq .",

    "this discrepancy with the cmf theory is interpreted as a reduction of the _ effective coordination number _",
    "@xmath9 from that of the original lattice , @xmath4 .",

    "although there have been several attempts@xcite to develop theories beyond the cmf for specific models so far , our understanding of @xmath10-independent renormalization of the effective coordination number is , fairly speaking , not yet satisfactory .",

    "we employ the monte carlo method combined with the finite - size scaling analysis for evaluating unbiased critical temperatures of the q1d ising models .",
    "since the present model has only the ferromagnetic couplings and has no frustration , the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm,@xcite or the wolff cluster algorithm,@xcite is one of the best algorithms . to optimize further for the q1d general - spin ising models , we extend the cluster monte carlo algorithm in the following two points .",
    "the first optimization is for strong anisotropy .",

    "the present method satisfies detailed balance conditions and ergodicity for any finite region including the central slice .",
    "typically , we spend @xmath102 monte carlo steps for measurement after discarding @xmath103 steps for thermalization for each parameter set @xmath104 .",
    "correlation functions @xmath105 can be measured efficiently in terms of a neat technique , so called _ improved estimator_,@xcite i.e.",

    "we can further rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eqn : correlation ] ) by introducing a function @xmath111 , which takes 1 if the subspin @xmath112 is on the @xmath113th cluster and takes 0 otherwise , as @xmath114    here one must recall that in the present algorithm clusters will be built only for a part of the lattice , and there is no way to judge whether two subspins belong to the same cluster when neither is on the built clusters .",
    "therefore the above improved estimator for the correlation function is valid only if at least one of @xmath109 and @xmath110 is guaranteed to belong always to built clusters . since only the subspins on the central slice satisfies this condition , @xmath24 or @xmath115 must be zero in eqs .",

    "this method works also for the three - dimensional case ( but does not for the sq+annni lattice due to the anisotropy intrinsic to the lattice ) . on the other hand , it is practically a hard task if one works in the standard square or cubic geometry , @xmath149 or @xmath150 , for monte carlo simulations .",
    "this is another advantage of the present monte carlo method for analyzing spatial anisotropy precisely , though we will not utilize this quantity in the remainder of this paper .",

    "the decrease is found extremely slow .",
    "even at @xmath155 the critical temperature is as high as 10%20% of the isotropic case .",

    "one can indeed confirm that the analytic and numerical results for the renormalized coordination number , @xmath194 and 3.0449(4 ) for the sq and sc lattices , in the last section agrees completely with the quantum critical point of the transverse - field ising model , @xmath195 ( ref .  ) and 3.0440(7 ) ( ref .  ) or 3.0450(2 ) ( ref .  ) on the single chain and the isotropic square lattice , respectively . note that in the argument presented above , we do not assume any exact solutions except for the susceptibility of the genuinely one - dimensional model . therefore eq .",
    "( [ eqn:42 ] ) applies to arbitrary q1d ising models in any dimensions .",
    "( for example , it applies even to the models with frustration in the transverse directions . )",
    "one may expect that a spin-@xmath10 classical ising model could be similarly mapped onto a quantum ising model _ with the identical spin size_. however , this is not the case .",
    "such a naive mapping , albeit formally possible , gives no physically meaningful weak interchain coupling limit .    to see the difficulty for @xmath196 more precisely",
    ", we consider the @xmath67 case as an example . the @xmath67 local transfer matrix along chains",
    "is given by @xmath197 if this local transfer matrix is fit by an imaginary - time propagator @xmath198 by the following @xmath67 quantum hamiltonian : @xmath199 where the @xmath200 ( @xmath178 , @xmath4 ) is a spin-1 operator , @xmath189 the transverse field , and @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the longitudinal and transverse crystal fields , respectively , we obtain @xmath203 up to the leading order in @xmath204 . in the last equations ,",
    "however , one should notice that @xmath205 vanishes for @xmath59 ( so that @xmath189 itself can remain finite ) , whereas both @xmath201 and @xmath206 diverge even after being multiplied by @xmath185 .",
    "this desperate asymptotic behavior of the parameters of the mapped quantum system is due to the vanishing diagonal weight for the @xmath207 state in the transfer matrix @xmath208 .",
    "although for @xmath168 the weight of the states with @xmath209 becomes exponentially small at low temperatures , disregarding such matrix elements in the transfer matrix will mislead us into an incorrect quantum spin hamiltonian . in order to handle the anisotropic limit of the high - spin models with care , we introduce a unitary transformation defined below .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , only the two largest eigenvalues @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the local transfer matrix @xmath208 are dominant at low temperatures , and the other @xmath210 eigenvalues are exponentially small in comparison with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "now we introduce two column vectors @xmath211 and @xmath212 , which are linear combinations of the eigenvectors @xmath213 and @xmath214 associated with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , @xmath215 clearly @xmath211 and @xmath212 are orthogonal with each other by definition and furthermore they are interchanged by the spin inversion transformation , since @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under the transformation .",
    "this implies that one can interpret @xmath211 and @xmath212 as `` wave functions '' of a pseudo @xmath12 quantum spin .",
    "indeed , by a local unitary transformation by a matrix @xmath216 with @xmath211 and @xmath212 introduced above and @xmath217 for @xmath218 , the local transfer matrix at low temperatures @xmath59 is reduced to a @xmath219 matrix @xmath220 where @xmath221 .",
    "the whole transfer matrix @xmath222 of @xmath223 is also reduced to a @xmath224 matrix by the global unitary transformation using @xmath225 .",
    "we transform the diagonal matrix @xmath172 at the same time to keep the partition function  ( [ eqn : z - classical ] ) invariant . using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn:14])([eqn:17 ] ) , relevant matrix elements of @xmath172 in this new basis are calculated as @xmath226    the effective partition function of the spin-@xmath10 classical ising model in the weak interchain coupling limit thus becomes equivalent to a spin-1/2 partition function , and then is mapped onto a spin-1/2 quantum ising model , instead of spin-@xmath10 , as the same as the @xmath12 classical ising model . noticing that @xmath227 one can explicitly write down the correspondence between the spin-@xmath10 classical ising model and the spin-1/2 quantum transverse - field ising model as @xmath228 or @xmath229 for @xmath230 . furthermore , using the low - temperature asymptotic form for the correlation length of a single chain [ eq .  ( [ eqn : asym - xi-1d ] ) ] , we obtain a relation between the classical and the quantum critical point parameters as @xmath231 which reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eqn:41 ] ) for @xmath12 .",
    "the last equation suggests that two dimensionless variables , @xmath232 and @xmath233 , satisfy a scaling relation , @xmath234 with an @xmath10-independent constant @xmath235 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - scale ] , this scaling relation is tested explicitly by using the monte carlo results in the last section . for each lattice the data in the weak interchain coupling regime @xmath236 collapse on a single curve as expected from the scaling form  ( [ eqn:58 ] ) .    finally , using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : asym - chi-1d ] ) , the effective coordination number in the @xmath237 limit is obtained as @xmath238 , irrespective of the spin size , which is a proof of the @xmath10-independent renormalization of the coordination number suggested by the monte carlo simulation in the last section .",
    "one should note the nontrivial factor @xmath78 in the scaling variable @xmath239 , which cancels with the same factor in the scaling form for the single - chain susceptibility [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : asym - chi-1d ] ) ] to make the effective coordination number independent of @xmath10",
    ". we also emphasize that our final result , @xmath240 , does not depend on the scaling conjecture for the susceptibility and correlation length of a single chain ; it can be deduced more directly from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn:20 ] ) and ( [ eqn:57 ] ) instead .",
    "in this paper we presented our detailed analysis on the critical temperature and the effective coordination number of the q1d general - spin ising ferromagnets .",
    "the critical temperature is estimated down to @xmath241 with high accuracy by the cluster monte carlo method performed on infinite - length strips .",
    "it is demonstrated that as the interchain coupling is decreased the effective coordination number converges to a finite value @xmath158 , which is definitely less than the coordination number @xmath4 , quite rapidly .",
    "furthermore , we show unambiguously that the renormalized coordination number is independent of the spin size @xmath10 .",
    "this is the same as the observation for the q1d and q2d quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets , reported in ref .  , and thus is expected to be observed widely in other classes of quasi - low - dimensional magnets .",
    "we explain the origin of the renormalization of the effective coordination number by considering a mapping to quantum ising models , where the spin-@xmath10 classical ising model is rigorously shown to be mapped onto a spin-@xmath22 quantum transverse - field ising model , irrespective of the spin size @xmath10 , in the weak interchain coupling limit , and the effective coordination number is given by the quantum critical point @xmath193 of the mapped quantum ising model .",
    "it should be noticed that in the scaling relation of the critical temperature [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn:58 ] ) ] , a nontrivial factor @xmath78 appears , which can not be deduced by a naive dimensional analysis .",
    "this factor cancels out with another nontrivial factor in the single - chain susceptibility [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : asym - chi-1d ] ) ] , and then results in an @xmath10-independent scaling relation .",
    "another remarkable fact to be noticed is that corrections to the asymptotic value in the effective coordination number are much smaller than those in the single - chain susceptibility itself , which suggests existence of a more fundamental theory , describing the critical temperature of strongly anisotropic magnets , than the modified cmf relation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cmf - tc ] ) combined with @xmath242 .",
    "the renormalized coordination number is , however , found to be nonuniversal with respect to the lattice structure .",
    "this is natural from the viewpoint of the mapped quantum ising model , where the critical transverse field of a quantum critical point can not be a universal quantity ; it depends on the fine lattice structure as well as on the details of interaction .",
    "thus an introduction of a weak further neighbor interaction or an anisotropy in slices , for example , will modify the renormalized coordination number . in this sense ,",
    "the `` universality , '' discussed in the present paper , is different from that asserted for critical exponents in usual continuous phase transitions and thus inexact terminologically .",
    "finally , we emphasize again that the weak interchain coupling limit of the q1d classical ising model is _ not the weak coupling limit _ ; it is still in the strongly correlated regime , i.e. , in the vicinity of a quantum critical point , of the mapped quantum ising model .",
    "this explains why the cmf approximation remains inaccurate even in this limit .",
    "we expect a similar argument will apply to the q1d and q2d quantum heisenberg models .",
    "it is unclear and remains as an open problem , however , whether it is possible to generalize the present mapping approach to the quantum heisenberg models , where a continuous axis , the imaginary - time axis , exists intrinsically , and therefore extra care should be necessary to introduce another continuous axis representing a strong spatial anisotropy .",
