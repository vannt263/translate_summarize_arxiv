    "the field of exoplanets is blessed in these years by an impressive flow of new exciting discoveries .",
    "as the sample of known exoplanetary systems increases several interesting characteristics become evident posing new challanging issues for theories of planet formation and evolution .",
    "given their short periods and their large masses the so called hot - jupiters were the first class of exoplanets being discovered around solar type stars ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) .",
    "those among them later found to transit in front of the disk of the star ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ) also gained a special importance given that they allow us to acquire physical informations like the radius and the density of the planet which would remain otherwise inaccessible . at the time of writing this paper , there were 187 known and confirmed transiting planets , and 87 of them have a period smaller than 10 days and a mass larger than 0.7 @xmath3 .",
    "several hypothesis were endeavored to explain the origin of these objects involving scenarios where these giant planets , while originally forming in remote regions of the planetary system , were then moved to their actual position by means of different possible mechanisms which can be essentially grouped in three broad classes : ( i ) planet - protoplanetary disk interactions leading to inward migration of the giant planet ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; nelson et al .",
    "2000 ) ; ( ii ) planet - planet scattering in multi - planetary systems ( weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; chatterjee et al . 2008 ; juri & tremaine 2008 ) ; ( iii ) kozai - induced migration in inclined planetary or binary stellar systems ( kozai 1962 ; wu & murray 2003 ; fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ) .",
    "while the first class of mechanisms would produce in principle a smooth migration leading to circularized orbits preserving the original alignment between the spin axis of the star and the orbital angular momentum axis of the planet , the other two processes may result in final eccentric orbits and largely misalinged spin - orbit angles .",
    "as it was evidenced by exploiting the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( rossiter 1924 ; mclaughlin 1924 , hereafter rm effect ) , most transiting exoplanets have spin - orbit angles perfectly consistent with zero , but some of them present surprisingly large misaligned angles ( triaud et al .",
    "these differences highlight the fact that probably all these processes are playing a role in shaping the structure of these systems ( nagasawa et al .",
    "2008 ) .    to further clarify the relative importance of these different theoretical scenarios and understand under which situations one mechanism may prevail over the others , some additional and important related questions need to be carefully examinated .",
    "one of them concerns the need to understand if these objects are actually isolated or if other planets or even stellar companions are gravitationally bounded with the system . despite the importance of this topic in the framework of our understanding of hot - jupiter planets , our knowledge is still far from being complete .    in this paper , while attempting to shed new light on this problem , we considered the case of the transiting hot - jupiter wasp-3b , collecting all the photometric and radial velocity data acquired so far as well as presenting our new photometric measurements .",
    "we used this database to investigate the presence of an additional companion in this system .",
    "wasp-3b is a hot - jupiter planet with a mass of @xmath4 revolving around a main sequence star of spectral type f7 - 8v with a period of @xmath5 days .",
    "its discovery was announced in 2008 by the wasp consortium ( pollacco et al .",
    "2008 ) as a result of a photometric campaign conducted with the robotically controlled wasp - north observatory located in la palma and subsequent radial velocity follow - up obtained with the sophie spectrograph at the observatory de haute - provence .",
    "the first photometry of wasp-3b was presented in the discovery paper of pollacco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) which used superwasp - n together with iac80 cm and keele 80 cm telescopes data to refine the properties of the transiting object .",
    "two additional transits of wasp-3b were observed by gibson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with the rise instrument mounted on the fully robotic 2 m liverpool telescope .",
    "tripathi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) observed six transits of wasp-3b at the 1.2 m flow telescope and at the 2.2 m university of hawaii telescope . joining their results with those of pollacco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and gibson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) they concluded that a linear fit to the observed ephemerides was not satisfactory , and that either the errors were underestimated or there was a genuine period variation .",
    "maciejewski et al .  (",
    "2010 ) presented six new transits gathered at two 1 m class telescopes ( jena and rozhen ) pointing out that a periodic signal was present in the observed minus calculated ( hereafter o - c ) transit timing diagram , and that an outer perturbing planet in the system could have best explained the observations . later on christiansen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) discussed eight new transits of wasp-3b observed during the nasa epoxi mission of opportunity . despite the high precision of their transit timing measurements",
    ", these data have never been used so far to analyze transit timing variations of wasp-3b .",
    "recently littlefield  ( 2011 ) reported five additional transit measurements of wasp-3b which were observed with the 11-inch schmidt - cassegrain telescope at jordan hall on the university of notre dame campus . despite the larger uncertainties with respect to previous studies the analysis of littlefield apparently provided an initial modest support to the hypothesis of maciejewski et al .",

    "we decided to perform the fit twice , first following the analysis of those authors and therefore allowing for a total number of four different barycentric radial velocities .",

    "we notice that tripathi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) excluded from the fit three data points which were presenting a clearly deviant radial velocity with respect to the remaining measurements .",

    "our best - fit parameters are given in table  [ tab : results_rv ] along with the values obtained by other authors .",
    "our best - fit model corresponds to a @xmath14 for the four @xmath11 solution and to @xmath15 for the two @xmath11 solution .",
    "our results are in agreement with the literature values .",
    "the barycentric velocities for the case of the four @xmath11 solution are consistent with those derived by tripathi et al .",

    "( 2010 ) , and in the case of the 2@xmath11 solution our values for each dataset are in between the results reported by those authors for their own data . we obtained a value of the spin - orbit angle consistent with zero .",
    "we also notice that the rotation velocity we obtained for the four @xmath11 solution ( @xmath16 ) is perfectly consistent with the result of miller et al .",
    "( 2010 ) implying @xmath17 .",
    "for the two @xmath11 solution we obtained instead a larger value of the rotation velocity ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "in a first step , we analyse whether or not a quadratic departure from a linear fit is present in the transit timings .",
    "this could result from the direct interaction with a perturber on an extended orbit ( borkovits et al .",
    "2011 ) , or from the light travel timing produced by the motion of the star also induced by a hypothetical distant companion ( montalto  2010 ) .",
    "this test can be performed following the approach of pringle ( 1975 ) which measures the improvement of a fit by a quadratic parabola with respect to a simpler one by a straight line . however , the quadratic coefficient obtained by least square is already zero within the errorbars @xmath19 days .",
    "we thus conclude that there is no significant long term quadratic trend in the data .    then , we follow the analysis of maciejewski et al .",
    "we compute a lomb - scargle periodogram on the transit timing variation ( ttv ) signal in order to detect a periodic oscillation that would reflect the perturbation of a close - in undetected body in the system . for that purpose , we use the generalized version ( gls ) of the lomb - scargle periodogram ( zechmeister & k@xmath20rster 2009 ) .",
    "basically the gls fits a sinusoid to the data for each frequency by using the least square method , as the lomb - scargle algorithm , but in addition to that it allows for the presence of an additional constant term .",
    "false - alarm probabilities ( fap ) are estimated by computing gls periodograms on a large number of sets of artificial observations in which , for each epoch where a transit has been observed , we replace the measured ( o - c ) by a random value normally distributed around zero with a standard deviation equal to the uncertainty of that point .",
    "the number of periodograms containing a peak with an power above a given threshold out of the total number of trials represents our estimation of the fap for that given threshold .",
    "[ figpsd](a ) shows the gls periodogram obtained when considering only the transits used by maciejewski et al .",

    "we obtain a dominant peak at a frequency @xmath21 cycle @xmath22 , which corresponds to p@xmath23 days and an power of 0.61 , as shown by the arrow , in complete agreement with the result of maciejewski et al .",
    "nevertheless the false - alarm probability associated to that power is 27@xmath24 .",
    "there is thus more than one chance out of 4 for this peak to be fortuitous . for the sake of completeness",
    ", the false - alarm probability thresholds of 0.1 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are represented by three horizontal lines in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ figpsd ] .",
    "we did again the same analysis with all the data of the table  [ tab : midtransits ] .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figpsd](b ) . in that case , the peak with the highest power is now at @xmath27 cycle @xmath22 with a fap equal to 56@xmath24 .",
    "it thus seems that the ttv signal does not contain any significant periodic oscillations .",
    "we initially checked for the presence of either a linear or a quadratic term in the ( o - c ) radial velocity residuals by using the pringle ( 1975 ) test .",
    "we considered the 2@xmath11 solution and obtained that in both cases the coefficients are consistent with zero ( @xmath28 for the quadratic term ) and ( @xmath29 for the linear term ) .",
    "a gls periodogram was then computed .",
    "we considered initially the case of the residuals obtained fitting the 4@xmath11 solution ( sect .",
    "[ s : analysis_rv ] ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvresper ] , no significant peaks can be found in the periodogram .",
    "the highest peak is at 0.35 days and has a fap of 31@xmath24 .",
    "alternative , considering the residuals obtained by the 2@xmath11 solution , we obtained the highest peak at 0.36 days with a fap=39@xmath24 .",
    "the fap of the peaks are estimated with a bootstraping method in the same way as in the previous section .",

    "since the ttv signal does not present any long term variations , nor short period oscillations , one can not assert that the system actually contains an additional planet . and ,",
    "if such a companion does exist , its orbital parameters and its mass are poorly constrained due to the lack of expected patterns in the current available data .",
    "nevertheless , the residuals of the fit are quite large ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 for transit and rv respectively ) . as noticed also by other investigators in the past these values",
    "do not indicate a satisfactory fit to the ( o - c ) .",
    "the model is thus not complete .",
    "several causes can be at the origin of this result among which we consider here stellar activity , the presence of an additional planet or exomoon and underestimated timing uncertainties .",
    "a possible source of ttvs can be the activity of wasp-3 .",
    "indeed , the existence of spots on the surface of the star , partially covered by the planet during transits , should produce fluctuations in the luminosity leading to some errors in the determination of the times of transit minimum ( e. g. sanchis - ojeda et al .",
    "2011 ; oshagh et al .",
    ". moreover , the spots , if they exist , should not be the same between the beginning and the end of the observations given the long time span that has been covered ( @xmath32 years ) .",
    "this would explain why no periodic oscillation is detected .",
    "tripathi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported fractional transit depth variations of the order of @xmath33 , even if the same authors were not confident whether these variations were genuine or due to systematics in their data .",
    "in addition , they report a mean logr@xmath34=-4.9 from their keck spectra taken in 2008 - 2009 .    on the other hand , we reanalysed the spectra taken with sophie . from the 2007 observations ( pollacco et al .",
    "2008 ) we derived a @xmath35 value of -4.95 , whereas the 2009 - 2010 observations ( simpson et al . 2010 ) provided a higher value for the activity index of @xmath36=-4.80 .",
    "therefore it appears that the mean activity level of the star changed during these years approaching an active phase in 2010 . once considering also the upper limit on the stellar age and the rotation period reported by miller et al .",
    "( 2010 , age@xmath37 gyr and @xmath38 4.3 days ) the presence of active regions on this star may not appear a rare circumstance . despite no clear evidence of starspots crossing has been reported yet , this analysis clearly claims for a more intensive monitoring of the activity level of wasp-3 in order to understand its impact on photometric and radial velocity measurements .",
    "we now give some constraints on the mass of a hypothetical planetary perturber .",
    "for that , we use both the dispersion of the o - c radial velocity and photometric diagrams . for what concerns the radial velocity residuals we adopted here the results coming from the 2@xmath11 solution , since no significant difference was found adopting instead the 4@xmath11 solution .      in the literature ,",
    "two main approaches are used to find the detection limits in radial velocity data .",
    "one is based on @xmath39- and @xmath40-tests ( e.g. lagrange et al .",
    "2009 , sozzetti et al .",
    "2009 ) , another is based on a periodogram analysis ( cumming , marcy & butler 1999 , endl et al .",
    "2001 , cumming 2004 , narayan , cumming & lin 2005 ) . here",
    ", the second approach was chosen due to the number of measurements which is considered high enough for a reliable periodogram analysis .",
    "for each period , a fake eccentric planetary signal is inserted in the data , while the original data is treated as random noise . on these new rv series ,",
    "the power ( in the periodogram ) is calculated .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the fake signal is changed untill the fap level is reached for all eccentricities @xmath41 , times of periastron @xmath42 and longitudes of periastron @xmath43 . in this paper ,",
    "a fap of @xmath44 , determined with @xmath45 shuffled time series , is used .",
    "fake signals are tested for periods @xmath46 between 1 and 20 days .",
    "the orbital elements of the eccentric signals range , in 10 steps , as follows : @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the final semi - amplitude can be transformed in planetary mass and expresses the lower limit for detectable planets at that period with these data .",
    "@xmath50 with the planetary mass in earth mass , the semi - amplitude @xmath51 in m / s , the period @xmath46 in days , the stellar mass @xmath52 in solar masses and the gravitational constant @xmath53 in m@xmath54kg@xmath55s@xmath56 .",
    "therefore the continuous grey line in fig .",
    "[ figmmax ] denotes the limit in the perturber mass beyond which a signal would have been detected in the radial velocity data with a confidence limit equal to @xmath57 .",
    "the dashed lines shows the 1-@xmath58 uncertainty range of the radial velocity detection limit .",
    "we exclude compact systems which lead to unstable evolutions .",
    "only circular and coplanar systems have been considered since they provide the strongest constraints and because the projected spin - orbit angle measure on wasp-3b by the rossiter - mclaughlin effect is compatible with zero as demonstrated above , suggesting that if a planetary companion exists , the system is likely coplanar .    the radial velocity measurements are used to exclude any perturbers that would induce rv signal with an amplitude larger than the 1@xmath24 fap threshold .",
    "the same exercise has been performed with the o - c of the transit timing measurements .",
    "for that , we simulated a large number of o - c on a grid of parameters of the perturber .",
    "we considered 400 periods @xmath59 ranging between 1.5 and 10 @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the period of the transiting planet ) , and 100 masses @xmath62 evenly distributed in logarithm between 0.01 and 5 @xmath63 . for each period and mass ,",
    "60 simulations are performed with different initial longitudes between 0 and 360@xmath64 . among the 60 simulations ,",
    "the one giving the periodogram with the lowest maximum amplitude is kept .",
    "if this amplitude is above the 1@xmath24 fap threshold determined in section [ s : oc ] , then the corresponding perturber should have been detected in the periodogram of the o - c ( see fig .  [ figpsd ] ) , otherwise the perturber can exist but it is not detectable .    figure  [ figmmax ] ( left ) shows the results .",
    "the hatched region , which extends up to a period ratio of 1.5 , delineates the chaotic orbits which are excluded .",
    "the boundary of this region has been derived from the stability criterion of ( gladman 1993 ) .",
    "the gray curve fixes the limit of the perturber s mass from the radial velocity measurements .",
    "any perturber in the gray region would induce a periodic rv signal with a significant amplitude . and",
    "finally , the black regions delineate the perturbers that produce ttvs with significant oscillating terms . combining all the information",
    ", it turns out that the radial velocity technique excludes any perturber as massive as jupiter up to a period ratio of 10 , and the ttv measurements provide stronger constraints close to mean motion resonances .    in a second step",
    ", we focused on perturbers that do not produce any significant periodic rv signals nor periodic ttv signals .",
    "such perturbers are located in the white region of fig .",
    "[ figmmax ] ( left ) .",
    "for those perturbers , we check whether they can reproduce the o - c transit timing diagram or not . in that purpose , we use the same grid of parameters as in fig .",
    "[ figmmax ] ( left ) , and for each initial conditions , we compute the expected ttvs and the reduced chi - square with respect to the observations .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figmmax ] ( right ) .",
    "the hached and the gray regions are the same as in fig .",
    "[ figmmax ] ( left ) .",
    "the black regions correspond now to simulated ttvs above the 3-@xmath58 level .",
    "this threshold is obtained from the @xmath39-distribution with 33 degrees of freedom .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath65 , or @xmath66 .",
    "the colour scale represents the @xmath67 from the lowest values in red up to the 3-@xmath58 threshold in dark violet .",
    "the red circle shows the best fit to the observation with @xmath68 .",
    "however , such a perturber , with a mass of 0.63 @xmath63 should have been detected in the radial velocity analysis .",
    "the best fit within the undetectable perturbers is just below the rv detection threshold with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , but the corresponding reduced chi - square is only @xmath71 .",
    "the improvement is very weak .",
    "moreover , from fig .",
    "[ figmmax ] ( right ) , one can see that such values of the reduced chi - square are spread more or less randomly within the undetectable region .    as noted by maciejewski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the presence of an outer companion less massive than wasp-3b but still on a short period orbit would make the system quite unusual .",
    "multiplanetary systems containing at least a jupiter - mass planet are indeed much wider , and the less massive planet is usually the closest to the star ( e. g. lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "an exomoon is also supposed to generate a periodic oscillation in the ttv",
    ". however , maciejewski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have already discarded this hypothesis since the transits do not show any duration variations shifted in phase by @xmath72 with respect to the timing variations . here",
    ", we perform a more detailled analysis based on the results of kipping  ( 2009 ) .",
    "first of all , we check that an exomoon can have a stable orbit .",
    "if the moon is less than twice as dense as the planet the minimum distance of the moon is set by the roche limit .",
    "let @xmath73 be the semi - major axis of a hypothetical satellite divided by the hill radius , i.e. @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the semi - major axis of the moon and @xmath76 the hill radius . according to kipping  ( 2009 )",
    ", @xmath73 should satisfy the following inequality @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the roche limit . in this expression , @xmath79 is the mass of the satellite and @xmath46 is the orbital period of the planet . for an exomoon of the mass of the earth s moon , we get @xmath80 , and for an exomoon of the mass of the earth , @xmath81 . in both cases",
    "@xmath82 is lower than @xmath83 . for moons",
    "which density is more than twice that of the planet the roche limit would be inside the planet , therefore the minimum distance would correspond to the planetary radius and the above inequality would be automatically satisfied . therefore an exomoon can exist on a stable orbit around wasp-3 .",
    "then , we estimate the maximal rms amplitude ( @xmath84 ) of ttv that an exomoon on a coplanar circular orbit can produce .",
    "according to kipping ( 2009 ) , this amplitude is given by @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the sum of the planet mass and the satellite mass . without any constraint on @xmath88 , the maximum of the product @xmath89 is attained for @xmath90 , and is equal to @xmath91 . however , by definition , the moon should have a lower mass than the planet . if the transit lightcurves are those of the planet , @xmath88 should be lower than @xmath92 , and probably much lower .",
    "but let us assume that @xmath93 , this will provide the upper limit of @xmath94 .",
    "if the planet has an exomoon , the keplerian orbit derived in the previous section is that of the planet - satellite barycenter around the star .",
    "thus the fitted mass corresponds to @xmath95 . using @xmath96 , one obtains @xmath97}\\ .\\ ] ] for @xmath98 , this leads to @xmath99 min .",
    "the result is larger than the observed rms of the o - c which is equal to 1.1 min .",
    "thus , a `` satellite '' as massive as the planet ( @xmath93 ) is able to produce significant ttv with an amplitude comparable to the observed one .",
    "we now assume that the observed o - c is only due to an hypothetical satellite . expecting that this satellite should have a much smaller mass than the planet , we derive its mass for @xmath100 such that @xmath101 min .",
    "one gets @xmath102 , which corresponds to a mass ratio of @xmath103 , or @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the lowest massive satellite , on circular orbit , that can account for the observed rms of the o - c is still large .",
    "assuming the same density as a giant planet like jupiter , the radius of this satellite should be @xmath105 .",
    "such a big satellite , if it existed , would produce detectable transits in the lightcurve .",
    "we also noticed that a search for additional transiting objects in the nasa @xmath106 mission wasp-3 lightcurve resulted in a null detection ( ballard et al .",
    "2011 ) . however , we note that accordingly to domingos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) the value of the critical semi - major axis could approach the value of 0.9309 in units of the hill radius , for retrogade moons . in this case",

    "all the transits considered here were presented in referred journals and this ensures that accurate procedures like those ones reported here have been applied to estimate transit timing errors .",
    "it is our opinion however that error underestimation can not be completely ruled out .",
    "new observations will be certainly welcome to clarify this problem .",
    "in this work we provided a throughout analysis on the presence of additional bodies in the wasp-3 system .",
    "this analysis serves to improve our understanding of close - in jupiters and in particular to clarify if these planets are indeed isolated or not .",
    "in addition to present eight new transits of wasp-3b acquired at the crow - observatory - portalegre in portugal we reanalized all the photometric and radial velcocity measurements aquired so far for this system .",
    "we concluded that there is no convincing evidence of additional planetary companions in this system ; both the transit timing and the radial velocity residuals do not present significant periodicities ( fap=56@xmath24 and fap=@xmath111 for transit and radial velocity in the best case scenario respectively ) nor long term trends .    combining all transit timing and radial velocity informations , we obtained that any perturber more massive than @xmath112 and with period up to ten times the period of the inner planets is excluded at 99@xmath24 confidence limit .",
    "we also investigated the possible presence of an exomoon on this system and determined that considering the scatter of the o - c transit timing residuals a coplanar exomoon would likely produce detectable transits , an hypothesis that can be ruled out by observations conducted by other researchers . in case the orbit of the moon is not complanar the current accuracy of transit timing and transit duration measurements prevents to make any significant statement .",
    "for retrogade moons the maximum mass allowed at the critical semi - major axis is around 0.1 @xmath63 .    finally on the basis of our reanalysis of sophie data we noted that wasp-3 passed from a less active ( @xmath113 ) to a more active ( @xmath2 ) state between 2007 and 2010 . despite no clear spot crossing",
    "has been reported for this system so far we therefore pointed out the need for a more intensive monitoring of the activity level of this star in order to understand its impact on photometric and radial velocity measurements .",
