    "quantification of non - classical correlations in quantum systems is one of the main topics in quantum information theory .",
    "quantum entanglement is the most famous and best studied manifestation of such correlations , mainly because of its central role as a resource for quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , quantum entanglement is not the only type of non - classical correlation .",
    "it is now well - known that non - entangled mixed states can also exhibit non - classical features , which may be relevant in mixed - state based algorithms such as that of knill and laflamme @xcite .",
    "a great effort has therefore been devoted in recent years to understand and quantify the quantumness of correlations @xcite .",
    "various measures of these correlations beyond entanglement have then been proposed , which start with the quantum discord @xcite and the one - way information deficit @xcite .",
    "the latter has been extended to more general entropic forms @xcite , as a measure of the information loss due to a local measurement .",
    "various other related measures have also been later introduced @xcite .",
    "while these correlation measures have been intensively investigated in systems of distinguishable components , less attention has been given to their extension to systems of identical particles @xcite , and in particular to fermion systems .",
    "in these systems particles can not be accessed individually because of indistinguishability , thus preventing the straightforward extension of the correlation measures defined for systems of distinguishable components , which are based on the tensor product structure of the state space .",
    "this property no longer holds for indistinguishable components , turning the characterization of correlations more complex .",
    "various approaches for describing and quantifying entanglement in fermion systems have been introduced , based on quantum correlations and particle - like entanglement @xcite and also on mode - type entanglement @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite we analyzed the problem of quantifying entanglement in pure and mixed states of fermion systems having definite number parity , yet not necessarily a fixed particle number .",
    "the approach is based on a consistent definition of the measurement of the occupancy of a single - particle ( sp ) mode , and of the reduced state of such a mode and its orthogonal complement in the sp hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "it leads to an entanglement entropy which is explicitly invariant under particle - hole ( and also bogoliubov ) transformations , and which extends previous treatments for states with fixed particle number @xcite , providing at the same time a link between mode - based and particle based approaches .    in this work",
    "we start by considering again the correlations between a sp mode and its orthogonal complement and define an entropic measure that quantifies the loss of information in the state of the system due to the measurement of the occupancy of that mode .",
    "such loss is directly related to the entanglement generated between the system and the measurement device .",
    "we then consider the sum over all states on a given basis of @xmath0 , minimized over all such bases , of this quantity as a measure of the minimum loss of information due to an unread measurement in this basis , extending the minimization to all bases related through a bogoliubov transformation @xcite if the occupancy measurement of quasiparticle modes is also allowed .",
    "it is then shown that this measure is a non negative quantity which is zero if and only if the state of the system is a convex combination of slater determinants in the same sp basis , reducing for pure states to the entanglement entropy defined in @xcite , in analogy with its counterpart @xcite for systems of distinguishable constituents .",
    "general stationary conditions for the optimizing basis are also derived .",
    "an analytic evaluation of this measure for a mixture of a general pure state with the maximally mixed state is provided , which shows that in this case the optimizing quasiparticles are just those diagonalizing the generalized one - body density matrix , and that the present measure can be non - zero in non - entangled mixed states .",
    "explicit comparison with the fermionic entanglement of formation in a specific case is also made .",
    "two fermion states are as well discussed .",
    "we first consider a pure state @xmath1 of a fermion system with an @xmath2-dimensional single - particle ( sp ) hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "the system is described by a set of operators @xmath3 satisfying the canonical anti - commutation relations @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is an orthonormal set of one fermion states states ( @xmath6 denotes the vacuum of the operators @xmath7 ) .",
    "we will work within a grand canonical context , so the state @xmath1 does not necessarily has a definite particle number @xmath8 .",
    "nonetheless , we will always assume that @xmath1 has a definite number parity , @xmath9= \\prod_k(1 - 2c^\\dagger_k c_k)\\,,\\label{p}\\ ] ] in agreement with the standard superselection rule @xcite .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath10 the dimension of the fock space of the system .",
    "we now consider a partition @xmath11 of a particular basis of @xmath0 ( see appendix ) , where @xmath12 denotes the single mode or `` level '' @xmath13 and @xmath14 its orthogonal complement . due to the anticommutation relations ,",
    "the operators @xmath15 constitute a basic set of orthogonal projectors , defining a standard projective measurement on the level @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) projects the state onto the subspace of states with level @xmath13 occupied ( empty ) , so the set describes the measurement of the occupancy of this level .",
    "the ensuing post measurement states are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 for any operator @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) that depends only on the operators @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) we have , using ( [ p ] ) , @xmath27 where latexmath:[\\ ] ] with @xmath400 in a grand canonical ensemble , @xmath401 in an even parity ensemble and @xmath402 in a canonical ensemble .",
    "present results are then formally similar to those obtained for similar mixtures in bipartite distinguishable systems @xcite , with the slater basis replacing the local schmidt basis .",
    "we have discussed the problem of quantifying one - body discord - like correlations in general pure and mixed states of fermion systems , which may not have a fixed particle number ( but which commute with the number parity ) .",
    "first , the correlation between a single - particle mode and its orthogonal complement in the single - particle state space @xmath403 is considered .",
    "the measurement of the occupancy of a single - particle mode is properly defined and an entropic measure of the loss of information due to this projective measurement is introduced .",
    "the sum over all modes in a given basis of @xmath403 of this quantity , minimized over all such bases , is defined as the _ one - body information loss _ , a measure of the minimum loss of information due to an unread measurement .",
    "it is a non - negative quantity , invariant under arbitrary unitary transformations in @xmath403 , which vanishes if and only if the state of the system can be written as a convex combination of slater determinants in a common basis of @xmath403 , i.e. , if it remains invariant after the unread measurement of the occupancy of _ any _ sp level of this basis . for pure states it reduces to the fermionic entanglement entropy defined in @xcite .",
    "these properties still hold if quasiparticle level occupancy measurements are allowed , in which case minimization is to be extended to all bases related through a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the defined quantities are then extended to more general entropic forms , including trace form entropies and quantum renyi entropies .",
    "the general stationary condition to be satisfied by the minimizing measurement was also derived .    as application , we considered the mixture of a general pure state with the maximally mixed state for arbitrary space dimension .",
    "the minimum information loss was shown to be always reached for a measurement on the basis diagonalizing the generalized one - body density matrix , and to exhibit a universal quadratic initial increase with the mixing parameter , proportional to the quadratic entanglement entropy of the pure state .",
    "this fact implies that it can measure non classical correlations beyond entanglement , as explicitly verified for @xmath404 ( first non - trivial dimension for definite parity ) .",
    "the approach can be applied in both canonical and grand - canonical ensembles , and for general states such as mixtures of independent qusiparticle states or vacua , being then suitable for studying correlations in strongly interacting fermion systems and requiring just a sp basis optimization .",
    "its extension to more general partitions of the sp space may yield further insight into the structure of the state and is currently under investigation .",
    "we discuss here the entanglement associated to a general partition of a single particle ( sp ) space @xmath405 of a fermionic system .",
    "let us assume @xmath405 is of dimension @xmath2 , and consider a partition of @xmath405 in two orthogonal subspaces @xmath406 and @xmath407 , generated respectively by @xmath408 and @xmath409 orthogonal sp states of a given basis of @xmath405 , such that @xmath410 .",
    "any slater determinant in this basis can then be written , except for a global phase , as @xmath411 where @xmath412 is the occupation number of level @xmath413 ( @xmath414 ) and @xmath415 indicate the collection of these numbers .",
    "the full set of states @xmath416 , with @xmath417 , @xmath418 , form an orthonormal basis of the full ( grand canonical ) space of many fermion states in @xmath405 , of dimension @xmath400 .",
    "any pure fermion state @xmath1 with definite number parity can then be written as @xmath419 where the sum is restricted to states @xmath416 of the same number parity as @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath420 or @xmath421 states for @xmath1 of even parity ) .",
    "this implies that the matrix @xmath102 of elements @xmath422 is blocked in two submatrices ( @xmath423 and @xmath424 ) . after a singular value decomposition @xmath425 , with @xmath388",
    "a `` diagonal '' @xmath426 matrix of non - negative elements @xmath427 , and @xmath428 unitary matrices , we may rewrite this state as @xmath429 with @xmath430 orthonormal states .",
    "this is the schmidt decomposition associated with this partition .",
    "of course , @xmath315 and @xmath431 are also blocked , so that all states @xmath432 have the same number parity as @xmath1 .",
    "the entanglement entropy associated with the previous partition is then @xmath433 with @xmath434 the eigenvalues of @xmath435 ( or @xmath436 ) and @xmath437 the reduced states associated with subspaces @xmath406 and @xmath407 , such that any observable @xmath438 containing operators @xmath439 , @xmath440 with @xmath441 can be obtained as @xmath442 a slater determinant in a given sp basis is then completely separable , in the sense that @xmath443 for any bipartition @xmath444 of @xmath405 in this basis . on the other hand ,",
    "if a state is not a slater determinant there is no sp basis in which it is completely separable .",
    "note that @xmath445 commutes with number parity but will contain in general eigenstates of both parities .    in particular , if @xmath406 contains just a single state ( say @xmath13 ) , eq.([psimn ] ) becomes @xmath446 where @xmath447 and @xmath448 for @xmath449 .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) , equivalent to ( [ psik ] ) , is the schmidt decomposition of @xmath1 since the states @xmath450 and @xmath451 have opposite parity and are therefore orthogonal .",
    "the ensuing entanglement ( [ eab ] ) is then given by eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the entanglement of mixed states .",
    "if a partition of @xmath452 in two subspaces @xmath453 and @xmath454 is made , we may define the associated entanglement of formation of @xmath286 , @xmath455 , as the minimum of the average entanglement entropies @xmath456 over all decompositions @xmath457 , with @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath460 the reduced state of @xmath461 in the state @xmath462 and @xmath462 normalized many fermion states in @xmath407 , with the restriction ( since @xmath463=0 $ ] ) that all states @xmath462 have definite number parity .",
    "this implies that @xmath464 will be the average of the entanglement of formations for each parity , i.e. , @xmath465 if @xmath466 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath406 is a single state , eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) leads to @xmath467 with @xmath468 and @xmath451 of opposite parity .",
    "therefore , in this case the decomposition is unique and the entanglement of formation reads @xmath469 where @xmath470 , equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ sck ] ) , denotes the _ conditional _ entropy of subsystem @xmath461 after a measurement of the single level of @xmath12 in the mixed state @xmath471 , in agreement with the general result of @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that a general fermionic mixed state @xmath472 defined over a given sp space @xmath406 ( and commuting with @xmath161 ) can be purified in many ways , but in particular ( and efficiently ) by the addition of a complementary fermionic sp space @xmath407 , as is evident from the previous discussion . in a grand canonical context , if @xmath285 is , say , of rank @xmath473 , with @xmath474 eigenstates of each parity , it is sufficient to add @xmath2 orthogonal sp states generating an orthogonal sp space @xmath407 , and then form a pure state like ( [ psikk ] ) or ( [ psimn ] ) , which should have a definite number parity if physically realizable .",
    "if all eigenstates of @xmath285 are of the same parity then @xmath475 sp states should be added and just many fermion states of definite parity should be considered .",
