    "heterostructures with nanoobjects ( such as quantum dots , nanowires , molecules , etc ) hybridized to one conducting and another superconducting electrode seem to be promising testing fields where the strong electron correlations ( responsible e.g.  for coulomb blockade and kondo physics @xcite ) can be confronted with the superconducting order @xcite .",
    "coulomb repulsion between electrons in the solid state physics is known to suppress the local ( @xmath2-wave ) pairing and , through the spin exchange mechanism , eventually promotes the intersite ( @xmath3-wave ) superconductivity @xcite .",
    "mutual relation between such repulsion and the local pairing is however rather difficult for studying , both on theoretical grounds and experimentally . in nanoscopic heterostructures",
    "some of these limitations can be overcome by a suitable adjustment of the hybridization and the gate - voltage positioning of energy levels involved in the charge transfer @xcite .",
    "they enable a controllable changeover between the kondo regime and opposite case dominated by the induced on - dot pairing .",
    "quantum dot ( qd ) coupled with the strength @xmath4 to metallic conductor ( n ) and with @xmath5 to superconducting electrode ( s ) can exhibit the features characteristic both for the on - dot pairing and the kondo effect ( including their coexistence ) @xcite .",
    "their efficiency depends on the ratio @xmath6 . in the limit",
    "@xmath7 the underlying physics is controlled by on - dot pairing and manifests itself e.g.   by the particle - hole splitting of the quasiparticle levels . on the other hand for @xmath8",
    "the strong correlations take over .",
    "non - trivial aspects related to such interplay between the coulomb interactions and the proximity induced on - dot pairing has been addressed theoretically using various methods like : the mean field slave boson approach @xcite , the noncrossing approximation @xcite , perturbative scheme @xcite , constrained slave boson technique @xcite , numerical renormalization group @xcite and other @xcite .",
    "also the cotunneling regime of a coulomb blockaded quantum dot sandwiched between a normal and superconducting lead , where charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed , has been discussed emphasizing the role of in - gap resonances @xcite .",
    "as far as the experimental situation is concerned it has been less intensively explored .",
    "the earliest transport measurements for n - qd - s interface have been obtained using the multi - wall carbon nanotube deposited between au and al electrodes @xcite .",
    "those investigations concentrated however on the specific regime @xmath9 , when the coulomb correlations dominated over the proximity effect .",
    "other studies of the same group have been done for similar structures replacing a metallic electrode by a ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "several recent efforts focused on the multiterminal structures involving two normal and one superconducting electrodes as useful schemes for realization of : the crossed andreev reflections tunable via gate voltages @xcite , the cooper pair splitters @xcite , and the qd spin valves @xcite .",
    "= 6.5 cm    very useful understanding of a subtle interplay between the correlations and the induced on - dot pairing has been gained from recent measurements by r.s .",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the authors have explored the subgap transport originating from the andreev - type scattering processes for several representative ratios @xmath6 using the self - assembled inas quantum dots deposited between the golden ( n ) and aluminium ( s ) electrodes .",
    "their measurements provided the unambiguous experimental evidence for : a ) particle - hole splitting of the subgap conductance of the andreev states when @xmath10 , and b ) enhancement of the zero - bias andreev conductance due to formation of the kondo resonance at the fermi level of metallic lead , as has been qualitatively suggested by our studies @xcite and also indicated by other groups @xcite .",
    "the present work extends our former studies by taking into account interference effects arising from the additional degrees of freedom . as the simplest prototype for fano - type interference",
    "@xcite we consider the setup ( see figure [ scheme ] ) with a side - attached quantum dot contributing an extra pathway for electrons transmitted between the metallic and superconducting leads .",
    "our analysis is complementary to the previous study by y.  tanaka _ et al _ who considered the double quantum dots coupled between n and s leads in a @xmath0-shape setup but assuming @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite and in a series configuration @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the microscopic model and briefly outline basic notes on the nonequilibrium subgap transport . in the next section 3",
    "we discuss a unique way in which the fano - type lineshapes might be observed in andreev conductance , focusing on the uncorrelated quantum dots . in the last part ( section 4 )",
    "we discuss the influence of correlations at the interfacial quantum dot which seem to have remarkable influence on the low bias transport .",
    "we end with the summary and suggestions for the future studies .",
    "for description of the heterojunction illustrated in figure [ scheme ] we use the hamiltonian @xmath13 where the double quantum dot ( dqd ) is represented by @xmath14 the energies of each ( @xmath15 ) quantum dot electrons are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 stands for the usual interdot hopping .",
    "we restrict considerations of the correlation effects ( section 4 ) to the coulomb repulsion @xmath18 between opposite spin electrons @xmath19 , @xmath20 at the interfacial quantum dot .",
    "the external reservoirs n and s of charge carriers are described by @xmath21 and correspondingly @xmath22 assuming the isotropic energy gap @xmath23 .",
    "as usually @xmath24 denote the electron energies measured from the individual chemical potentials @xmath25 which become detuned @xmath26 if a bias @xmath27 is applied across the junction inducing the nonequilibrium charge flow @xmath28 .",
    "fano - type quantum interference effects originating from the hopping @xmath17 to side - coupled quantum dot @xmath29 are discussed here assuming that only the interfacial quantum dot @xmath30 is directly coupled to external leads @xmath31 in the wide - band limit approximation it is convenient to introduce the structureless coupling constants @xmath32 which shall be used here as the energy units .",
    "interplay between the proximity induced on - dot pairing , the correlations and the quantum interference effects can be in practice detected by measuring the differential conductance @xmath33 . particularly valuable for this purpose is the low voltage ( subgap ) regime @xmath34 . under such conditions the charge current",
    "is provided by the anomalous andreev scattering in which electrons from the metallic lead are converted into the cooper pairs in superconductor with a simultaneous reflection of the electron holes back to the normal lead . on a formal level",
    "the resulting andreev current can be expressed by the landauer - type formula @xcite @xmath35 , \\label{i_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the fermi distribution function and the transmittance @xmath37 depends on the off - diagonal part ( in the nambu notation ) of the retarded green s function ( [ gf ] ) of the interfacial quantum dot .",
    "fano resonances appear in many physical systems due to the quantum interference of the waves transmitted resonantly via some discrete energy level combined with transmittance contributed from a continuum of other states . in nanoscale physics",
    "such resonances are feasible in a variety of constructions @xcite .",
    "fano lineshapes are present for instance in the electron transport when two external electrodes are in parallel coupled through a quantum dot and directly via a shortcut bridge @xcite .",
    "another simple possibility takes place in the electron tunneling using two quantum dots with considerably different linebroadenings @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the narrower level is responsible for forming the fano resonance on a background of the broader level .    in this work",
    "we want to analyze similar interference effects appearing in the anomalous andreev current , which is very specific because of the particle and hole degrees of freedom mixed with one and other . to have a clear picture of the underlying physics let us start by considering the noninteracting case @xmath38 when the green s functions of each quantum dot can be determined exactly .",
    "electron transport of the setup shown in figure [ scheme ] is determined by effective properties of the interfacial quantum dot . for this purpose",
    "we compute the matrix green s function @xmath39 introducing the standard spinor notation @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the equilibrium conditions",
    "@xmath42 this function depends only on the time difference and its fourier transform obeys the following dyson equation @xmath43 where the term @xmath44 corresponds to the selfenergy of noninteracting case ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath45 accounts for the correlation effects ( discussed in section iv ) .",
    "focusing on the deep subgap regime @xmath46 we obtain that @xmath44 simplifies to ( see the appendix ) @xmath47 when the interference effects caused by the hopping @xmath17 to the side - coupled qd are neglected the expression ( [ sigma0 ] ) becomes static ( @xmath48-independent ) and nontrivial physics of this , so called _ atomic superconducting limit",
    "_ , has been explored in detail by several groups @xcite including ourselves @xcite .",
    "taking into account the quantum interference @xmath49 we show in figure [ dos ] the proximity induced on - dot pairing [ formally arising from the off - diagonal parts of ( [ sigma0 ] ) ] illustrating the energy spectrum @xmath50 obtained for strong coupling to the superconducting lead @xmath51 .",
    "such coupling @xmath52 is responsible for the particle - hole splitting of the effective quasiparticle states formed at @xmath53 whereas the coupling @xmath4 controls their broadening . in the particular case",
    "@xmath54 the quasiparticle peaks appearing at @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) are symmetric , but for arbitrary @xmath57 they are weighted by the corresponding bcs coefficients @xmath58 @xcite . on top of such behavior",
    "we clearly notice that hopping to the side - coupled quantum dot induces additional features appearing in the effective spectrum near @xmath59 as the fano resonance and antiresonance . for the case of both metallic leads there would survive just the single fano structure at @xmath60 which in very pedagogical way has been discussed by r.  itko @xcite .",
    "fano - type lineshapes ( see the lower panel in figure [ dos ] ) are present only in the weak hopping regime @xmath61 . for increasing @xmath17",
    "the fano structures gradually evolve into separate quasiparticle peaks illustrated in figure [ dos_evol ] .",
    "physically this can be assigned to the induced pairing on the side - attached qd @xmath62 transmitted there indirectly via the interfacial quantum dot .",
    "such effect again qualitatively differs from the structures of the dqd coupled to both metallic leads @xcite .",
    "interrelation between the interference and proximity effect can be practically investigated by measuring the tunneling current . in figure",
    "[ ga ] we show bias voltage @xmath27 dependence of the differential andreev conductance @xmath63 determined at zero temperature from ( [ i_a ] ) over a broad regime covering both the subgap quasiparticle peaks .",
    "figure [ ga_fano ] illustrates the resulting fano - type lineshapes @xmath64 nearby @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath67 gradually decreases upon increasing the hopping integral @xmath17 .",
    "our results can be thought as extension of the predictions obtained for the normal electron tunneling using the @xmath0-shape dqd coupled to both metallic leads @xcite onto the anomalous andreev current where the particle hole mixing has the essential importance .",
    "coulomb repulsion between electrons of opposite spins can have an important influence on the spectral and transport properties of various nanostructures .",
    "for the case of quantum dots coupled to both conducting leads such interactions are known to be responsible for : a ) the charging effect ( if a given energy level @xmath16 is attempted to be occupied by more than a single electron this costs the system an extra energy @xmath68 ) , b ) the kondo effect when the singlet state is formed between qd and itinerant electrons from the leads @xcite . in spectroscopic properties they are manifested by appearance of the coulomb satellite around @xmath69 and the narrow kondo resonance at the fermi level . for heterostructures with the superconducting electrodes the situation is more complex due to a competition between",
    "the induced on - dot pairing and coulomb repulsion .",
    "the rich interplay between the quantum interference , correlations and proximity effect for the configuration shown in figure [ scheme ] have been so far addressed using the density functional technique @xcite ( which does not capture the kondo physics ) and by the numerical renormalization group calculations @xcite . in latter case",
    "the authors focused on @xmath11 , @xmath12 when the side - attached quantum dot can indirectly form the kondo state with electrons of the metallic lead affecting the andreev transport .    to account for the correlation effects predominantly originating from the interfacial quantum dot",
    "we extend here the procedure previously used by us for studying the single quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to approximate the correlation selfenergy @xmath45 by the diagonal matrix @xmath70 such assumption ( applied also in the nrg studies @xcite ) can be thought as the simplest ansatz for the many - body selfenergy @xmath45 allowing to combine the proximity effect ( [ sigma0 ] ) with the correlations , brought separately from the particle and hole channels . in more advanced treatments",
    "one should take into account the possible feedback effects between these normal and anomalous channels .",
    "we nevertheless hope that by imposing ( [ u_correction ] ) we can get some insight at least on a qualitative level which might stimulate the future studies .    within qualitative studies of the correlation effects",
    "we can describe the coulomb blockade and kondo effects using the following equation of motion expression @xcite @xmath71 [ \\tilde{\\omega}\\!-\\!\\varepsilon_{1}\\ ! -\\!u_{1 } \\!-\\!\\sigma_{3}(\\omega)]\\!+\\!u_{1 } \\sigma_{1}(\\omega ) }   { \\tilde{\\omega}-\\varepsilon_{1 } - [ \\sigma_{3}(\\omega)+u_{1}(1\\!-\\!n_{1,\\sigma } ) ] } \\label{ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we explored the interfacial quantum dot spectrum and the related transport properties at @xmath75 , i.e.  well below the kondo temperature .",
    "specific numerical computations have been done for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and symmetric coupling to both external leads giving the optimal conditions for any low - bias features in the andreev current @xcite .",
    "this ratio @xmath78 is a reason why the particle - hole splitting is hardly visible , but otherwise ( for larger @xmath52 ) the kondo peak is either reduced or completely absent @xcite .",
    "upper panel in the figure [ corr_dos ] illustrates the fano resonance / antiresonance around @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 ) obtained for the hopping @xmath81 .",
    "these fano - type interference objects appear on top of the characteristic spectrum consisting of the kondo resonance and the broad quasiparticle peaks seen at @xmath57 and its coulomb satellite at @xmath82 .",
    "such spectrum is the result of interference effects discussed in the preceding section and the correlation features .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ corr_dos ] shows the very specific situation @xmath83 when the kondo and fano structures coincide with each other .",
    "the fano - type resonance seems to play then a dominant role .",
    "differential conductance of the andreev current ( [ i_a ] ) for the @xmath0-shaped double quantum dot system ( [ model ] ) is shown in figure [ kondo_peak ] .",
    "we notice a clear suppression of the zero - bias peak ( present for the single quantum dot case @xmath84 as indicated by the dashed lines ) because of a destructive influence of the fano - type interference ( the solid lines ) .",
    "the subgap andreev current is thus very sensitive to the interplay between the kondo and fano effects . for obvious reasons their most dramatic competition occurs when energy of the side - coupled quantum dot coincides with the kondo resonance , i.e.  for @xmath85 .",
    "quantum interference effects destroy then the kondo peak washing out the zero - bias enhancement of the andreev conductance .",
    "we have studied a unique nature in which the fano - type quantum interference manifest itself in the energy spectrum and differential conductance of the heterojunction where a metallic lead is coupled via double quantum dot to superconducting electrode . in the regime of subgap source - drain voltage",
    "@xmath86 nonequilibrium charge transport is contributed only through the anomalous andreev channel when electron from the metallic electrode is converted into the cooper pair ( propagating further in superconductor ) with a simultaneous reflection of hole back to the metallic lead .",
    "transmittance of such andreev scattering is a sensitive probe of the proximity induced on - dot pairing as well as the quantum interference and correlation effects .",
    "since on - dot pairing mixes the particle with hole states the interference effects are doubled in a comparison to similar junctions without the superconducting electrode . in particular , for @xmath0-shape configuration schematically shown in figure [ scheme ] we notice that effective spectrum of the interfacial quantum dot develops the resonance and antiresonance , correspondingly at @xmath87 ( figure [ dos ] ) .",
    "these fano - type structures are present whenever the hopping integral @xmath17 to the side - attached quantum dot ( @xmath29 ) is much smaller than the linebroadening @xmath4 ( whereas @xmath52 merely controls the induced quasiparticle splitting ) . upon increasing @xmath17",
    "the fano - type features disappear , evolving into the new quasiparticle peaks ( figure [ dos_evol ] ) being a consequence of the proximity effect indirectly spread onto the side - attached quantum dot .",
    "correlation effects play an important role with regard to the following aspects : a ) the charging effect which causes appearance of the coulomb satellite near @xmath82 , b ) the kondo singlet state ( when the interfacial quantum dot spin is effectively screened by electrons of the metallic electrode leading to formation of a narrow resonance at @xmath88 ) , and c ) eventual suppression the on - dot pairing .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that the kondo effect enhances the zero - bias andreev conductance as indeed reported experimentally @xcite . in the present work",
    "we indicate that in the double quantum dots the quantum interference can ( destructively ) affect such feature if the fano - type structures appear nearby the kondo peak",
    ".    a more detailed analysis of the fano - kondo interplay could be a challenging task in the future studies .",
    "for this purpose one should resort either to nonperturbative techniques , like the numerical renormalization group , or to some sophisticated perturbative methods capable to interpolate between the limits @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we thank b.  buka and k.i .",
    "wysokiski for instructive discussions on the fano resonances in nanophysics .",
    "this work is partly supported by the polish ministry of science and education under the grant nn202187833 .",
    "using the standard nambu notation we can express the retarded green s functions of the metallic lead @xmath92 the ( unperturbed ) side - attached quantum dot @xmath93 and the isotropic superconductor @xmath94 in the equation ( [ gs ] ) we applied the bcs coefficients @xmath95 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we then easily find that @xmath101 because , according to the kramers - krnig relation , the real part disappears .",
    "in the same way we obtain from a straightforward algebra that @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 in the extreme subgap limit @xmath46 the function ( [ gamma ] ) approaches @xmath104 and in consequence @xmath105 which proves the equation ( [ sigma0 ] ) .",
