    "the other hand gauge coupling unification permits one to incorporate susy models into superstring theories that make possible partial unification of gauge interactions with gravity . at high energies",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry in the superstring inspired models can be broken to rank5 subgroup @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "two anomaly - free @xmath7 and @xmath8 symmetries originate from the breakdown of @xmath0 and @xmath4 respectively , i.e. @xmath9 . here",
    "we concentrate on a particular @xmath0 inspired supersymmetric model with an extra @xmath1 gauge symmetry that corresponds @xmath10 . only in this exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath2ssm ) @xcite the right  handed neutrinos do not participate in gauge interactions",
    ". therefore they may be superheavy shedding light on the origin of lepton mass hierarchy .",
    "the extra @xmath1 gauge symmetry survives to low energies and forbids a bilinear term @xmath11 in the superpotential of the considered model but allows the interaction @xmath12 . at the electroweak ( ew )",
    "scale the scalar component of the sm singlet superfield @xmath13 acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath14 , breaking @xmath15 and an effective @xmath16 term is automatically generated .",
    "thus the @xmath17 problem in the e@xmath2ssm is solved in a similar way to the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , but without the accompanying problems of singlet tadpoles or domain walls .",
    "the e@xmath2ssm is based on the @xmath18 gauge group which is a subgroup of @xmath0 . to ensure anomaly cancellation the particle content of the e@xmath2ssm",
    "is extended to include three complete * @xmath19 * representations of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "each * @xmath20 * multiplet contains a sm family of quarks and leptons , right  handed neutrino @xmath21 , sm singlet field @xmath22 which carries a non  zero @xmath1 charge , a pair of @xmath23doublets @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the quantum numbers of higgs doublets and a pair of colour triplets of exotic quarks @xmath26 and @xmath27 which can be either diquarks ( model i ) or leptoquarks ( model ii ) . @xmath24 and @xmath25 form either higgs or inert higgs multiplets .",
    "we also require a further pair @xmath28 and @xmath29 from incomplete extra @xmath30 and @xmath31 representations to survive to low energies to ensure gauge coupling unification .",
    "our analysis reveals that the unification of the gauge couplings in the e@xmath2ssm can be achieved for any phenomenologically acceptable value of @xmath32 , consistent with the central measured low energy value , unlike in the mssm which requires significantly higher values of @xmath32 , well above central measured value @xcite .    since right  handed neutrinos",
    "have zero charges in the considered model they can acquire very heavy majorana masses .",
    "the heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos may decay into final states with lepton number @xmath33 , thereby creating a lepton asymmetry in the early universe . because the yukawa couplings of exotic particles are not constrained by the neutrino oscillation data the substantial values of the cp asymmetries in the considered model can be induced even for a relatively small mass of the lightest right  handed neutrino ( @xmath34 ) so that the successful thermal leptogenesis may be achieved without encountering gravitino problem @xcite .",
    "the superpotential of the e@xmath2ssm involves a lot of new yukawa couplings in comparison to the sm . in general",
    "these new interactions violate baryon number conservation and induce non - diagonal flavour transitions . to suppress baryon number violating and flavour changing processes one can postulate a @xmath35 symmetry under which all superfields except one pair of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( say @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and one sm - type singlet field ( @xmath38 ) are odd .",
    "the @xmath35 symmetry reduces the structure of the yukawa interactions to : @xmath39 + h^{e}_{4j}(h_d h')e^c_j + \\mu'(h'\\overline{h}')+w_{\\rm{mssm}}(\\mu=0 ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here",
    "we assume that all right ",
    "handed neutrinos are relatively heavy so that they can be integrated out .",
    "the @xmath23 doublets @xmath42 and @xmath43 , that are even under @xmath35 symmetry , play the role of higgs fields generating the masses of quarks and leptons after the ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the singlet field @xmath13 must also acquire large vev to induce sufficiently large masses for the exotic charged fermions and @xmath44 boson to avoid conflict with direct particle searches at present and former accelerators .",
    "this implies that the yukawa couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 should be large enough so that the evolution of the soft scalar mass @xmath47 of the singlet field @xmath13 results in negative values of @xmath47 at low energies , triggering the breakdown of @xmath1 symmetry . to guarantee that only @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath13 acquire vevs in the e@xmath2ssm a certain hierarchy between the yukawa couplings is imposed , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "after the breakdown of the gauge symmetry @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath13 form three cp - even , one cp - odd and two charged states in the higgs spectrum .",
    "the mass of the one cp  even higgs particle is always very close to the @xmath44 boson mass @xmath49 .",
    "the masses of another cp  even , cp  odd and charged higgs states are almost degenerate .",
    "as in the mssm and nmssm one of the cp  even higgs bosons is always light irrespective of the susy breaking scale .",
    "however in contrast with the simplest susy models the lightest higgs boson in the e@xmath2ssm can be heavier than @xmath50 even at the tree level . in the two ",
    "loop approximation the lightest higgs boson mass does not exceed @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "thus the sm  like higgs boson in the e@xmath2ssm can be considerably heavier than in the mssm and nmssm .",
    ".particle spectrum in the constrained e@xmath2ssm for @xmath52 ( all mass parameters are given in gev ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabular ]",
    "the e@xmath2ssm contains many new parameters .",
    "even if we neglect @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 the simplified superpotential of the e@xmath2ssm involves seven extra couplings ( @xmath56 , @xmath46 and @xmath45 ) as compared with the mssm with @xmath57 .",
    "the soft breakdown of supersymmetry gives rise to many new parameters .",
    "the number of fundamental parameters can be reduced drastically within the constrained version of the e@xmath2ssm ( cessm ) . constrained",
    "susy models imply that all soft scalar masses are set to be equal to @xmath58 at the scale @xmath59 , all gaugino masses @xmath60 are equal to @xmath61 and trilinear scalar couplings @xmath62 .",
    "thus cessm is characterised by the set of yukawa couplings , which are allowed to be of the order of unity , and universal soft susy breaking terms , i.e. @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the @xmath67quark , @xmath68quark and @xmath69lepton yukawa couplings . to simplify our analysis",
    "we assume that all parameters ( [ 3 ] ) are real and @xmath61 is positive . in order to guarantee the correct ewsb",
    "@xmath58 has to be positive .",
    "the set of the cessm parameters ( [ 3 ] ) should be in principle supplemented by @xmath56 and the associated bilinear scalar coupling @xmath70 .",
    "however since @xmath56 is not constrained by the ewsb and the term @xmath71 in the superpotential ( [ 2 ] ) is not suppressed by the @xmath0 the parameter @xmath56 is expected to be @xmath72 so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 decouple from the rest of the particle spectrum . as a consequence parameters @xmath70 and @xmath56 are irrelevant for our analysis .    in order to calculate the particle spectrum within the cessm",
    "we evolve all mass parameters from the grand unification scale to the susy breaking scale for each set of gauge and yukawa couplings at the scale @xmath59 . in our analysis",
    "we use two  loop renormalisation group ( rg ) equations for the gauge and yukawa couplings together with two  loop rg equations for @xmath73 and @xmath74 as well as one  loop rg equations for @xmath75 . at the next stage of our analysis",
    "we fix @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the vevs of the higgs fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and choose @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath61 so that the ew symmetry breaking constraints are satisfied , i.e. @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a higgs effective potential .",
    "although the correct ewsb is not guaranteed in the considered model , remarkably there is always a solution for sufficiently large values of @xmath46 which drive @xmath47 negative .",
    "finally at the last stage of our analysis we vary yukawa couplings , @xmath84 and @xmath76 to establish the allowed range of the parameters and qualitative pattern of the particle spectrum in the e@xmath2ssm .",
    "the results of our study of the particle spectrum in the e@xmath2ssm are summarised in the table  1 .",
    "we find that a set of the lightest susy particles in the ce@xmath2ssm always includes the gluino @xmath85 , the two lightest neutralino ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) and the lightest chargino @xmath88 .",
    "all other susy particles can be substantially heavier .",
    "nevertheless there exists a part of the e@xmath2ssm parameter space where exotic quarks , exotic squarks , inert higgs bosons and inert higgsinos can be also relatively light ( see scenario ii ) .",
    "if neutralino , chargino and gluino are the only lightest susy particles then one can expect to observe @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 pair production at the lhc .",
    "since each gluino will decay further into quark , antiquark and lightest neutralino ( or chargino ) the gluino pair production will result in an appreciable enhancement of the cross section of @xmath93 .",
    "if all squarks are much heavier than the gluino , i.e. particle spectrum has a very hierarchical structure , then gluinos can be relatively long lived particles because @xmath94 in the considered case . in particular their lifetime",
    "can be comparable with the lifetime of @xmath95 and @xmath96 bosons . at the same time",
    "the pair production of the second lightest neutralino also gives rise to a remarkable signature .",
    "when @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the lightest susy particles the second lightest neutralino will decay predominantly into lepton , antilepton and @xmath86 .",
    "thus @xmath92 pair production would generate an excess in the cross section of @xmath97 that should be possible to observe at the lhc .",
    "other possible manifestations of the e@xmath2ssm at the lhc are related with the presence of a @xmath44 and of exotic multiplets of matter .",
    "for instance , @xmath44 boson can be discovered at the lhc if its mass is less than @xmath98 . when the yukawa couplings of the exotic particles have a hierarchical structure some of the exotic fermions can be relatively light so that their production cross section at the lhc can be comparable with the cross section of @xmath99 production .",
    "assuming that @xmath27 and @xmath26 couple most strongly with the third family quarks and leptons the lightest exotic quarks decay into either two heavy quarks @xmath100 or a heavy quark and @xmath69lepton @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is either a @xmath68- or @xmath67-quark .",
    "this can lead to the substantial enhancement of the cross section of either @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath44 and exotic quarks predicted by the e@xmath2ssm would represent a possible indirect signature of an underlying @xmath0 gauge structure at high energies and provide a window into string theory",
