    "randomly diluted uniaxial antiferromagnets , for instance , fe@xmath5zn@xmath6f@xmath7 and mn@xmath5zn@xmath6f@xmath7 , have been much investigated experimentally and theoretically @xcite . for sufficiently low impurity concentration @xmath8 , these systems undergo a second - order phase transition at @xmath9 .",
    "the critical behaviour is approximately independent of the impurity concentration and definitely different from the one of the pure system .",
    "these results have been successfully explained by the field - theoretical ( ft ) renormalisation group ( rg ) , which predicts the presence of a single universality class associated with the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition that occurs in ising systems with quenched random dilution .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) results have been contradictory for a long time , finding model - dependent critical exponents . in @xcite this apparent non - universality",
    "was shown to be an effect of strong scaling corrections .",
    "they are slowly decaying due to the fact that the leading correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath10 is quite small : @xmath11 ( see [ omegaest ] ) .",
    "the analyses significantly gain accuracy when using improved hamiltonians , for which the leading scaling corrections are suppressed for any thermodynamic quantity , and improved estimators , which are such that the leading scaling correction is suppressed for any model in the same universality class .",
    "mc simulations of different improved hamiltonians @xcite confirmed that the static critical behaviour is model - independent , in agreement with the ft description , and provided accurate estimates of the static critical exponents , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "they are in good agreement with the ft perturbative results @xcite @xmath14 and @xmath15 obtained by the analysis of high - order ( six - loop ) perturbative expansions ( similar results are obtained at five loops @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent non - universality observed in previous numerical works was mainly due to the fact that scaling corrections were neglected .",
    "as a consequence , previous studies did not really observe the asymptotic critical behaviour and only determined effective exponents depending on all parameters of the investigated model .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to the critical dynamics .",
    "we consider a purely relaxational dynamics without conserved order parameters , also known as model a @xcite , as appropriate for uniaxial magnetic materials .",
    "experimental results are reported in rhe-92,bfjklm-88,barrett-86 . according to the ft rg ( see , e.g. ,",
    "jos-95,cg-05,fm-06 ) , the dynamic behaviour should be the same in all rdis systems , as is the case for the static criticality .",
    "moreover , the leading scaling corrections appearing in dynamical quantities should be associated with the same rg operators that control the nonasymptotic behaviour of static quantities and thus , they should be characterized by the same exponents as in the static case , i.e. , by @xmath16 and @xmath17 . as a consequence , in the case of improved hamiltonians , leading scaling corrections",
    "should also be absent in dynamical quantities .",
    "therefore , the most precise estimates of dynamic universal quantities should be obtained in improved models , as in the static case .",
    "previous mc studies @xcite of equilibrium and off - equilibrium dynamics apparently have not confirmed the ft general predictions .",
    "they have mainly focused on the dynamic critical exponent @xmath4 , which characterizes the divergence of the autocorrelation times when approaching the critical point . in most of the cases",
    "they have found that @xmath4 is model dependent and have provided estimates which range from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , depending apparently on the method , the favoured values of the dilution parameter @xmath20 , whether it is determined from equilibrium or off - equilibrium simulations , etc . in @xcite the universality of @xmath4 was verified , obtaining @xmath19 , but the leading scaling - correction exponent was not consistent with the static one , as predicted by the ft approach . moreover ,",
    "this result is inconsistent with the perturbative ft estimate obtained from analyses of the perturbative expansions @xcite at two and three loops , which suggest @xmath21 .",
    "in this paper we study three disordered ising systems whose static critical behaviour belongs to the 3d rdis universality class : the randomly site - diluted ising model ( rsim ) , the randomly bond - diluted ising model ( rbim ) , and the @xmath22 ising model along the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition line .",
    "their static critical behaviour was carefully investigated in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath23 of the dilution parameter corresponding to an improved model was determined for each of them .",
    "we simulate these models by using the metropolis algorithm ( with a suitable modification in the case of the rsim and rbim to avoid ergodicity problems , see [ appmetro ] ) , which does not satisfy any conservation law , and thus allows us to investigate the model - a dynamics .",
    "we consider cubic lattices of size @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the main purpose is to check whether the dynamic critical behaviour is consistent with the ft rg , that is with the existence of a unique model - a universality class for rdis systems .",
    "we focus on the dynamic critical exponent @xmath4 , and determine it in the rsim , the rbim , and the @xmath0 ising model .",
    "we find that the autocorrelation times extracted from the autocorrelation function of the magnetic suspectibility at @xmath26 behave as @xmath27 with a universal value of the dynamic exponent @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 and @xmath28 are consistent with the static scaling - correction exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we obtain the estimates @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively for the rsim , the rbim , and the @xmath0 ising model at @xmath32 .",
    "they are in good agreement , strongly supporting universality .",
    "results for other values of @xmath20 , both larger and smaller than @xmath23 , are consistent with the estimates of @xmath4 obtained at @xmath32 .",
    "we consider @xmath33 as our best estimate of @xmath4 for the dynamic model - a universality class of rdis systems .",
    "these results confirm the general picture that comes out of the ft analysis .",
    "however , from a quantitative point of view , our estimate significantly differs from the perturbative result @xmath34 at three loops @xcite .",
    "apparently , perturbative ft expansions at this order are not able to predict accurately the exponent @xmath4 .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 can also be determined by performing off - equilibrium simulations , since the approach to equilibrium is controlled by the same ft model jss-89,oj-95,cg-05 . as a further check of our result ( [ veryfinalintro ] ) ,",
    "we have performed off - equilibrium mc simulations of the rsim at @xmath35 , quenching @xmath2 configurations to @xmath3 .",
    "the results show that the relaxation to equilibrium is controlled by the same dynamic exponent obtained in equilibrium simulations , i.e. @xmath1",
    ". moreover , the large - time corrections are consistent with what is predicted by the ft rg , which relates them to the static leading and next - to - leading scaling - correction exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "our results therefore confirm the ft analysis of the off - equilibrium relaxational dynamics @xcite .",

    "we also consider the @xmath0 ising model , defined by hamiltonian ( [ hb ] ) with exchange interactions @xmath40 which take values @xmath48 with probability distribution @xcite @xmath49 unlike the rsim and the rbim , the @xmath0 ising model is frustrated for any @xmath20 .",
    "nonetheless , the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition line that occurs in this model for @xmath50 and @xmath51 also belongs to the rdis universality class @xcite . here",

    "we consider a relaxational dynamics without conserved order parameters , i.e.  the so - called model a. in lattice systems this dynamics is usually realized by using the metropolis algorithm . in the case of the rsim and of the rbim",

    "we use the standard metropolis algorithm with a sequential updating scheme . in this model",
    "the specific problem we observed in the rsim and in the rbim is not present ( note , however , that , to our knowledge , a rigorous proof of ergodicity is lacking for this updating scheme ; this is also the case of the pure ising model ) .",

    "] detailed balance is satisfied only if the spins are updated in random order .",
    "it is commonly accepted that these two dynamics belong to the same universality class : these violations of detailed balance are irrelevant in the critical limit .",
    "we consider the two - point correlation function @xmath65 where the overline indicates the quenched average over the disorder probability distribution and @xmath66 indicates the thermal average . near the critical point correlations develop both in space and time . they can be characterized in terms of the equal - time second - moment correlation length @xmath67 and of an autocorrelation time @xmath68 . in the infinite - volume limit",

    "therefore , we have @xmath114 .",
    "this implies @xmath115 for @xmath110 large enough .",

    "] thus , we have proved that , for any @xmath124 , the ratio @xmath96 is finite and strictly positive in the critical limit .",
    "it follows that @xmath89 diverges as @xmath95 in the critical limit .",

    "while an exponential decay of the correlations is obvious in pure ferromagnetic systems for temperatures @xmath94 , in the case of random systems some discussion is needed .",
    "indeed , in dilute systems one expects a non - exponential relaxation for large values of @xmath79 @xcite , due to the presence of rare compact clusters without vacancies that are fully magnetized at temperatures that are below the critical temperature of the pure system ( the same clusters are responsible for the weak griffiths singularities in the high - temperature free energy @xcite ) .",

    "also @xmath77 may show a non - exponential behavior for large @xmath79 in the high - temperature phase .",
    "however , note that this does not necessarily imply that the scaling function defined in ( [ scal - a ] ) decays non - exponentially . on the contrary",
    ", one can argue @xcite that the griffiths tail ( [ g - non - exp ] ) becomes irrelevant in the critical limit .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that @xmath130 and @xmath131 that appear in ( [ g - non - exp ] ) are expected to be smooth functions of the temperature that approach finite constants as @xmath132 .",
    "thus , in the critical limit , @xmath133 , @xmath132 at fixed @xmath103 , the non - analytic contribution simply vanishes . to have the form @xmath134 .",
    "the first term is the critical contribution , while the second one is the non - exponential griffiths tail .",
    "the second term dominates for @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the value of @xmath79 at which the two terms have the same magnitude . in the critical limit",
    "we have @xmath137 .",
    "since the critical limit is taken at @xmath138 fixed , the relevant quantity is @xmath139 , which diverges as @xmath140 , as @xmath132 .",
    "this means that , for any fixed value of @xmath141 , sufficiently close to the critical temperature , @xmath79 always satisfies the condition @xmath142 , i.e. belongs to the region in which the non - exponential tail ( [ g - non - exp ] ) is negligible .",
    "these considerations also indicate that one should limit oneself to times @xmath143 in studies of the infinite - volume critical behavior in the high - temperature phase .",
    "therefore , one should always choose @xmath72 so that @xmath144 for all considered systems .",
    "otherwise , the extrapolated critical behavior would be incorrect . ]    in the above - presented discussion , @xmath89 represents an infinite - volume autocorrelation time determined in the high - temperature phase .",
    "a similar discussion applies if we consider the fss behavior .",
    "for instance , at @xmath26 we have @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the lattice size . the function @xmath147 decays exponentially for any @xmath146 (",
    "this is rigorously true for an aperiodic dynamics in a discrete spin system ) .",
    "this fact does not necessarily imply that @xmath148 decays exponentially ( a non - exponential behavior could occur if the exponential decay sets in for @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) , though the discussion presented above makes this possibility quite unlikely . in any case , if @xmath148 decays faster than any power of @xmath151 , the previous proof indicates that @xmath152 is finite in the critical limit for any finite @xmath72 , and thus @xmath89 is a good autocorrelation time .    beside the integrated autocorrelation time",
    "one can also define an exponential autocorrelation time : @xmath153 this quantity is well defined in a finite volume since @xmath147 decays exponentially , but , as a consequence of ( [ g - non - exp ] ) , it diverges in the infinite - volume limit for all @xmath154 . as a consequence , in the infinite - volume limit at fixed temperature , @xmath89 diverges as @xmath155 .",
    "however , the decoupling of the non - exponential tail in the critical limit implies that @xmath156 is finite and related to the decay rate of @xmath102 for large @xmath103 .",

    ", @xmath157 is always well defined .",
    "nonetheless , this does not imply that @xmath157 is a good autocorrelation time . on the contrary , at @xmath3 we expect @xmath158 to diverge as @xmath159 .",
    "indeed , for each @xmath146 , @xmath160 is always given by the decay rate of the autocorrelation function for the slowest sample , however small is the amplitude of this contribution to the autocorrelation function ( note that , for finite values of @xmath146 , the disorder average is a finite sum ) . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath160 is the exponential autocorrelation time for a pure ising system in the low - temperature phase , which is expected to increase faster than any power of @xmath146 , as @xmath161 [ if tunnelling events dominate @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath163 as @xmath159",
    ". the irrelevance of the griffiths phenomenon in the critical limit should however imply that @xmath164 is finite and related to the decay rate of @xmath148 .",

    "the effect is however small , because of statistical correlations that also increase as @xmath59 decreases . in our work",
    "we have always considered values of @xmath59 much smaller than @xmath89 ( typically @xmath167 ) and we have verified that the estimate of the autocorrelation times are independent of the chosen ( small ) value of @xmath59 .    definition ( [ defbl ] ) provides an effective exponential autocorrelation time at a finite time scale . in the same spirit",
    ", one can also define truncated integrated autocorrelation times .",
    "define @xmath168 for any integer @xmath169 , and @xmath170 for any real @xmath79 by linear interpolation .",

    "instead , if one is not interested in determining @xmath80 but only in computing @xmath4 , @xmath72 can be taken at will .    in this paper",
    "we compute the exponent @xmath4 from the volume dependence of an autocorrelation time at the critical temperature . including scaling corrections",

    "also in this case autocorrelation times behave as in ( [ taufss2 ] ) .    in order to determine",
    "@xmath4 it is crucial to have some knowledge of the correction - to - scaling exponents that appear in ( [ taufss2 ] ) .",
    "rg predicts that the static correction - to - scaling exponents also occur in dynamic quantities .",
    "for instance , if @xmath174 behaves as @xmath175 at criticality for @xmath161 , then a correction term decaying as @xmath176 is also expected in @xmath177 for any @xmath178 .",
    "however , dynamics gives also rise to new scaling corrections and they may decay slower than the static ones ( for instance , this occurs in the model - c dynamics , see sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] ) .",
    "in this paper we make the assumption that no new scaling corrections with exponent less than @xmath179 appear , as indicated by the ft description of the model - a dynamics . as we shall see , this will be confirmed by our numerical analysis .",

    "the scaling corrections proportional to @xmath183 vanish , so that the leading correction - to - scaling exponent is @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , numerical studies of improved models are expected to provide the most precise estimates of universal quantities .",
    "of course , this is true only if the usual model - a ft description is correct ; otherwise , there could be corrections with a new dynamic exponent @xmath184 , which do not cancel and may give rise to large corrections even in models that are improved for static quantities .",
