    "the advent of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5 ) as an effective approach to qcd at low energies @xcite in hadron dynamics has allowed steady progress in the field of meson - baryon interaction @xcite . yet , an important step in the application of the chiral lagrangians at higher energies than allowed by @xmath5 is the implementation of unitarity in coupled channels .",
    "pioneering works in this direction were those of @xcite , where the lippmann - schwinger equation in coupled channels was used extracting the kernels from the chiral lagrangians .",
    "subsequent steps in this direction were done in @xcite in the study of the @xmath6 interaction with the coupled states using the bethe - salpeter equation and introducing all the channels which could be formed from the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and stable baryons .",
    "further steps in this direction in the strangeness @xmath7 sector have been done in @xcite .",
    "the works of @xcite deal only about the @xmath4-wave @xmath8 scattering , and one obtains a remarkably good agreement at low energies with the data for transitions of @xmath6 to different channels , indicating that the @xmath0-wave and higher partial waves play a minor role at these energies .",
    "the extension of these works to include @xmath0-wave or higher partial waves is thus desirable in order to see whether the agreement found with only @xmath4-wave is an accident or whether one confirms that the contribution of the @xmath0-wave is indeed small .",
    "there is also an important feature of the @xmath0-wave which is the presence of the @xmath9 resonance appearing with the same quantum numbers as those of the @xmath6 system , although only visible in @xmath10 or @xmath11 states since the resonance is below the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "the introduction of @xmath0-waves in the strangeness @xmath1 sector was done in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "only the region of energies above the @xmath6 threshold is investigated but the @xmath9 resonance region is not explored . in @xcite",
    "the decouplet of the @xmath9 is explicitly included as a field and new chiral lagrangians to next to leading order are introduced to deal with the meson - baryon scattering problem . in this latter work",
    "the around 25 free parameters of the theory are fitted to the data , although some of the parameters are constrained by large @xmath12 arguments .",
    "simplicity is one of the appealing features of the @xmath6 interactions from the perspective of chiral symmetry .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , it was found that using the transition amplitude obtained with the lowest order chiral lagrangian as a kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation , and a cut - off of about 630 mev to regularize the loops , one could reproduce the cross sections of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , together with the properties of the @xmath19 resonance , which is dynamically generated in that scheme .",
    "it is remarkable that , using the same input , one can also obtain the @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath4-wave resonances @xcite as well as the @xmath22 @xcite , which completes the octet of lowest energy @xmath4-wave excited baryons together with the @xmath23 obtained in @xcite following the same lines .    the idea here is to see whether the simplicity observed in the @xmath4-wave interaction holds also for @xmath0-waves .",
    "in other words , we would like to see what does one obtain for the @xmath0-wave amplitudes using again the lowest order chiral lagrangians and the same cut - off parameter as in @xcite .",
    "anticipating results , we can say that the @xmath0-wave amplitudes obtained with this line are in good agreement with experiments , as well as the properties of the @xmath9 resonance , thus obtaining a parameter - free description of the @xmath0-wave phenomenology in the @xmath1 sector .",
    "following @xcite we write the lowest order chiral lagrangian , coupling the octet of pseudoscalar mesons to the octet of @xmath24 baryons , as    @xmath25 \\right\\rangle        \\label{chirallag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the symbol @xmath26 denotes the trace of su(3 ) flavor matrices , @xmath27 is the baryon mass and @xmath28 \\nonumber \\ , \\\\    \\gamma_{\\mu } & = & \\frac{1}{2 } ( u^\\dagger \\partial_{\\mu } u + u\\ , \\partial_{\\mu }        u^\\dagger ) \\nonumber \\ , \\\\",

    "the results with the @xmath4-wave   alone are equivalent to those presented in @xcite . as already remarked there , the agreement with experiment is quite good , particularly taking into account that only a free parameter , the cut - off , has been fitted to the data .",

    "[ massdist ] by changing @xmath150 by @xmath151 .",

    "the ratio of the partial decay widths obtained is @xmath156 which compares well with the experimental value of @xmath157 .",
    "we have looked for poles in the complex plane in the @xmath0-wave   amplitudes and have not found any , except for the @xmath2(1385 ) which is introduced as a genuine resonance in our approach , in the same way as the @xmath56 or @xmath57 baryons are included as basic fields in the theory .",
    "this means that the strength of the lowest order @xmath0-wave  amplitudes is too weak to generate dynamical resonances , contrary to what was found in @xcite for the @xmath4-waves .",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath0-wave  amplitudes for meson - baryon scattering in the strangeness @xmath1 sector starting from the lowest order chiral lagrangian , unitarizing by means of the bethe - salpeter equation , or equivalently the @xmath3 method , and regularizing the loops with a cut - off or an equivalent method using dimensional regularization .",
    "the cut - off , or equivalently the subtraction constants in the dimensional regularization procedure , is fitted to the scattering observables at threshold . in practice",
    "we take them from earlier work @xcite where only the @xmath4-wave  amplitudes were studied in our approach .",
    "once this is done there is no extra freedom for the @xmath0-wave  amplitudes , which are completely determined in our approach .",
    "we perform some fine - tuning of the subtraction constants with respect to @xcite in order to obtain better results for the @xmath144 cross section , which however does not practically modify the @xmath0-wave  amplitudes .    the results which we obtain for the @xmath0-wave  amplitudes in this approach are consistent with experimental data for the differential cross sections .",
    "the contribution to the total cross sections at low energies is very small but in the differential cross sections its effects are clearly visible producing a slope in @xmath158 as a function of @xmath159 which is in good agreement with the data .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the @xmath0-wave  in the @xmath1 sector is the presence of the @xmath2(1385 ) resonance below the @xmath127 threshold .",
    "this resonance can not be generated dynamically from the strength of the @xmath0-wave  in lowest order of the chiral lagrangians and hence is introduced as a basic field , like the @xmath56 or the @xmath57 .",
    "it couples to the meson - baryon states with a strength obtained using su(6 ) symmetry from the standard chiral lagrangians involving pseudoscalar mesons and the octet of stable baryons . with these couplings and the unitarization procedure the @xmath2(1385 )",
    "develops a width . in this sense , the total width of the @xmath2 , as well as the branching ratios to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are predictions of the theory and they come out with values in agreement with experiment .",
    "the approach followed here corroborates once more the potential of the chiral lagrangians to describe the low energy interaction of mesons with baryons , provided a fair unitarization procedure is used to appropriately account for the multiple scattering of the many channels which couple to certain quantum numbers . in this particular case , the previous works in the @xmath1 sector in @xmath4-wave , together with the present one for @xmath0-wave ,",
    "provide a good theoretical framework to study the meson - baryon dynamics at low energies .",
    "these works show that the basic dynamical information is contained in the chiral lagrangian of lowest order , since by means of a proper unitarization procedure in coupled channels and one regularizing parameter of natural size for the loops , one can describe quite well the low energy scattering data in the different reactions with @xmath1 .",

    "<S> we perform an evaluation of the @xmath0-wave amplitudes of meson - baryon scattering in the strangeness @xmath1 sector starting from the lowest order chiral lagrangians and introducing explicitly the @xmath2 field with couplings to the meson - baryon states obtained using su(6 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 method of unitarization is used , equivalent , in practice , to the use of the bethe - salpeter equation with a cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure leaves no freedom for the @xmath0-waves once the @xmath4-waves are fixed and thus one obtains genuine predictions for the @xmath0-wave scattering amplitudes , which are in good agreement with experimental results for differential cross sections , as well as for the width and partial decay widths of the @xmath2(1385 ) . </S>"
