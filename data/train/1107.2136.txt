    "<S> we compare fully perturbative and fully nonperturbative pictures of high-@xmath0 energy loss calculations to the first results from lhc . </S>",
    "<S> while oversuppressed compared to published alice data , parameter - free pqcd predictions based on the whdg energy loss model constrained to rhic data simultaneously describe well the preliminary cms hadron suppression , atlas charged hadron @xmath1 , and alice @xmath2 meson suppression ; we also provide for future reference whdg predictions for @xmath3 meson @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , energy loss calculations based on ads / cft also qualitatively describe well the rhic pion and non - photonic electron suppression and lhc charged hadron suppression . </S>",
    "<S> we propose the double ratio of charm to bottom quark @xmath4 will qualitatively distinguish between these two energy loss pictures .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _ the current and future challenge to theoretical calculations will be to simultaneously describe the multiple high-@xmath0 observables measured at rhic and lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this will prove to be a daunting task as a simultaneous description of multiple observables at rhic is not even at hand @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , generic arguments based on rhic results naturally lead one to predict a suppression greater than that in published lhc data , regardless of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 pathlength ( i.e.  specific energy loss mechanism ) dependence @xcite . despite the difficulty of the task , the reward is potentially enormous : high-@xmath0 particles provide the most direct probe of the @xmath8 dependence of the organization of the soft - soft and soft - hard degrees of freedom in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in heavy ion collisions . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we will compare the fully weakly- and strongly - coupled pictures to the recent data from rhic and lhc ; we will find that while neither provides a fully compelling picture of the experimental results , neither is ruled out by data .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9{raa276log7forproc.png } & \\includegraphics[width=1.8in]{cmswhdg.png } \\end{array}$ ] +    @xmath10    _ perturbative picture _ in a perturbative calculation of partonic energy loss in a qgp , the high-@xmath0 parent parton loses energy via both elastic and inelastic processes ; the size of this loss in calculable using standard feynman diagram techniques . </S>",
    "<S> this in - medium energy loss is convolved with the production spectrum , also determined via pqcd , and vacuum fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> while many pqcd - based energy loss calculations describe the suppression of neutral mesons at rhic , @xmath11 , none are able to simultaneously describe quantitatively both the normalization and angular distribution of @xmath4 of @xmath12 s nor the normalization of @xmath4 for both @xmath12 s and heavy flavor electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we can quantify the generic statement about over - suppression given above using the whdg energy loss model @xcite , which includes both the collisional and radiative energy loss processes in a realistic , bjorken - expanding medium : predictions for the suppression of high-@xmath0 @xmath12 mesons assuming that the qgp density scales with the observed charged particle multiplicity , @xmath13 , with the proportionality constant between the qgp density and @xmath13 found by a rigorous statistical analysis @xcite , are given in @xcite ; these predictions are compared to the published alice data @xcite in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ raa ] ( a ) and preliminary cms data @xcite in fig .  [ raa ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> one sees in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ raa ] ( a ) that despite the over factor of 2 increase in medium density , the observed increase in suppression in published alice data from top rhic energy to lhc is small ; there is even only a small increase in suppression from preliminary @xmath14 = 62.4 agev data @xcite to @xmath14 = 200 agev data at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary cms data , with @xmath4 out to @xmath15 gev / c , shows a significant rise as a function of @xmath0 , which is in exact qualitative agreement with pqcd expectations : perturbatively , the fractional energy loss of high-@xmath0 particles goes as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the power that best approximates the power law production spectrum for partons at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the parameter - free whdg prediction at lhc energies rigorously constrained by rhic data is significantly more suppressed for 0 - 5% centrality collisions than the central values of the published alice data . as the whdg predictions are consistent with the peripheral 70 - 80% collisions , the whdg @xmath19 does not compare well with the that which one extracts from the alice data , especially as the uncertainty in the production spectra drops out of the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> however , the comparison between the whdg predictions and the preliminary cms data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ raa ] ( b ) is quite reasonable with the given experimental and theoretical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> it seems , then , that the quantitative question of whether the whdg calculation , and pqcd - based energy loss calculations in general , can describe the normalization of @xmath4 at lhc when constrained by rhic is still open . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully the answer to this question will become clearer when the p+p baseline spectrum is analyzed out to @xmath15 gev / c . however , there are two additional questions : 1 ) to what extent do initial state effects , such as those that turn off as a function of @xmath0 ( due to , e.g. , the suppression of small-@xmath20 gluons as expected from saturation physics ) , account for the qualitative rise in @xmath21 at lhc ? and 2 ) can whdg , and pqcd - based energy loss calculations in general , describe quantitatively describe multiple observables ( e.g. @xmath1 , the suppression of heavy flavors , @xmath22 , etc . ) out to very large , @xmath15 gev / c ? </S>",
    "<S> we look forward to the answer of the first question , which will come from the observation of @xmath23 gev / c direct photons and/or a measurement of suppression in p + a collisions </S>",
    "<S> . the second question has been preliminarily addressed at moderate momenta in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ v2raa ] : the parameter - free whdg extrapolation to lhc provides an excellent description of ( a ) @xmath24 of charged hadrons measured by atlas @xcite and ( b ) the suppression of @xmath2 mesons as measured by alice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the suppression of @xmath2 mesons begins to exceed that of pions at @xmath25 gev / c , due to the much more steeply falling production spectrum and the shortened formation time of the heavy quark </S>",
    "<S> . it will be interesting to see if the agreement seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ v2raa ] continues once the uncertainties and momentum reach of the measurements improve . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary results from cms on the distribution of the energy lost from a high-@xmath0 particle to very wide angles also helps constrain the energy loss mechanism in qgp . </S>",
    "<S> pqcd intuition would suggest that perturbative radiative energy loss would be concentrated at collinear angles of @xmath26 , a more detailed examination of the differential single inclusive gluon radiation distribution shows that pqcd predicts the emission of radiation at quite large angles @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27{pi0v22764050watlas.png } & \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{dmesonsc.png } \\end{array}$ ] +    @xmath10    _ nonperturbative energy loss and comparison _ fully nonperturbative treatments of heavy quark energy loss at rhic show qualitative agreement with the measured suppression of non - photonic electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ads ] ( a ) that a simple bragg model of light quark and gluon energy loss , in which the probability of escape for a parent parton is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( with appropriate proportionality coefficients found in @xcite ) provides a qualitatively consistent picture of the measured suppression of charged hadrons at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the pqcd energy loss calculations appear to have a strong dependence on the initial thermalization time and pre - thermalization conditions @xcite . additionally , </S>",
    "<S> although there may be future means of directly measuring the initial gluon wavefunction at an electron - ion collider @xcite , model calculations of observables are also dependent on the medium geometry used . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that the double ratio of charm to bottom quark @xmath21 will provide valuable  perhaps even unambiguous  evidence of the dominant energy loss mechanism at work in heavy ion collisions , with qualitatively different behavior for fully weakly and fully strongly coupled energy loss calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , perturbative qcd predicts a rapid rise to 1 in the ratio as a function of @xmath0 as the pqcd calculation becomes insensitive to the mass of the parent parton ; on the other hand , ads / cft drag results suggest a nearly @xmath0-independent ratio significantly suppressed from 1 at approximately the ratio of the quark masses , @xmath30 .    </S>",
