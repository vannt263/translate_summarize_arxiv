    "classical double radio galaxies are active galactic nuclei with regions of synchrotron - emitting plasma that can extend to thousands of kiloparsecs . these fanaroff - riley type ii radio galaxies",
    "@xcite are thought to be powered by narrow collimated jets , terminating in high surface brightness regions called ` hotspots ' .",
    "regions of low surface brightness emission lying between the galaxy center and the hotspots , called radio bridges , are believed to be a result of the accumulation of relativistic particles accelerated at the hotspots over the lifetime of an frii source that form a low - density cocoon around the jet ( see * ? ? ? * for a theoretical review ) .",
    "the ultimate motivation of our project is to study the radio bridges in frii radio galaxies and do a spectral aging analysis . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of our study and describe the global properties of our frii radio galaxy sample .    in order to comprehend the phenomenology of frii galaxies , large samples of radio galaxies",

    "results from arcsecond - scale radio observations of frii radio galaxies have been presented by many authors , for example , @xcite and @xcite , and others .",
    "previous studies of the radio bridges have included relatively low - resolution observations ( @xmath0 ) at 151  mhz and 1.4  ghz of the full bridge region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the higher resolution observations ( @xmath1 ) at 1.4 , 5 and 15  ghz have sampled the bridge emission partially ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , to empirically address and understand the different physical processes that are important at different radio frequencies , physical locations , and stages of evolution of a source , both low - frequency radio data and high - resolution radio data are required .    to this end , we observed 13 frii radio galaxies with the very large array ( vla ) in multiple configurations at 330  mhz , 1.4  ghz , 5  ghz , and 8  ghz .",
    "here we present images of the total and polarized radio intensity , spectral index between 1.4 and 5 ghz , 0.3 and 1.4 ghz , and rotation measure between 1.4 and 5 ghz .",
    "further , we probe the relationship between different global characteristics of the radio galaxies by augmenting our data with additional galaxy data gleaned from the literature",
    ". we will subsequently refer to this extended , eclectic sample as the `` combined '' dataset , while the 13 frii galaxies will be referred to as such .",
