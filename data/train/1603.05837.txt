    "with the discovery of the standard model ( sm ) higgs in the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments , we have taken one step further toward understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) through the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) mechanism in the scalar sector .",
    "the next mission for the high - luminosity large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to explore not only the detailed properties of the sm higgs , but also the new physics effects .",
    "since problems related to the origin of neutrino mass , dark matter ( dm ) , and matter - antimatter asymmetry can not be resolved in the sm , it is believed that the sm of particle physics is an effective theory at the electroweak scale .",
    "if new physics exists at the tev scale , the lhc can detect it .",
    "some potential events indicating the existence of new effects indeed have been observed in the recent atlas and cms experiments .",
    "for instance , diboson excess of @xmath20 with @xmath21 at around 2 tev was shown by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite ; the branching ratio ( br ) for lepton - flavor - violating higgs decay @xmath22 with a @xmath23 significance was presented by cms  @xcite ; a resonance at a mass of 750 gev in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum was reported by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite .",
    "although the results are not conclusive yet , these experimental measurements have inspired theorists to speculate various effects to interpret the excesses .    ever since the sm higgs was observed ,",
    "the higgs measurements have approached to the precision level .",
    "it becomes an important issue to uncover the physics beyond the sm through the higgs portal .",
    "precise higgs measurements can also give strict bounds on the new couplings ; for instance , @xmath24 in the two - higgs - doublet model has been limited to be close to the decoupling limit  @xcite , and the sm with a fourth generation of chiral fermions has become disfavored  @xcite .",
    "although the extension of the sm with chiral fermions has been severely limited , the constraint on the vector - like quark ( vlq ) models may not have the same situation due to the use of different representations and coupling structures . unlike chiral fermion models , where the appearance of chiral quarks has to accompany chiral leptons due to gauge anomaly , the gauge anomaly in vlq models is cancelled automatically .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to introduce the exotic heavy leptons into the sm when vlqs are added .",
    "due to their interesting properties , the phenomena of some specific vlqs at the lhc have been investigated from a theoretical viewpoint  @xcite . in experiments , single vlqs and pairs of vlqs",
    "have been produced at atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite .",
    "based on the sm gauge symmetry @xmath25 , the representations of vlqs can basically be any @xmath26 multiplets .",
    "however , in order to consider the vlq decays , the possible representations of vlq couplings to the sm quarks are singlet , doublet , and triplet . to interpret the excesses of dibosons and diphotons indicated by atlas and cms , we proposed a model that contains one higgs singlet and two triplet vlqs with hypercharges of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "since the representations of the vlqs are different from those of the sm quarks , the higgs- and @xmath1-mediated flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) are induced at the tree level and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is non - unitary matrix . in our earlier studies , besides the resolutions of the excesses , we focused on the leading effects , which were from the left - handed flavor - mixing matrices , and found that they led to interesting contributions to top fcncs @xmath29 and the sm higgs production and decays .    in this study , we systematically discuss the left- and right - handed flavor - mixing effects together .",
    "we revisit the constraints and present the bounds from @xmath30 processes in detail . with the values of constrained parameters",
    ", it is found that the modified top coupling to the sm higgs , which arises from the right - handed flavor mixing , can diminish the influence of the sm higgs production and the decay to diphotons by around @xmath2 and @xmath31 deviations from the sm results , respectively .",
    "we demonstrate how the changes of the sm ckm matrix elements can be smeared so that the severe bounds from the current measurements of the ckm matrix elements are satisfied  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the phenomena in flavor physics , we also investigate the single and pair production of vlqs in this work . in the proposed model ,",
    "the new quarks are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , whose associated electric charges are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be regarded as top and bottom partners , respectively . since vlqs @xmath34 and @xmath35 carry",
    "the unusual electric charges , they do not have fcnc couplings to the sm quarks . as a result , their single production and decays are only through charged weak interactions .",
    "since the top and bottom partners involve more complicated fcnc interactions , we concentrate the study on vlqs @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is found that the single production cross sections of @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be larger than the pair production cross sections , which are dominant from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in order to understand this phenomenon",
    ", we analyze each process @xmath40 for the single production of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is found that with @xmath41 tev , the cross sections for @xmath42 and @xmath43 modes can be of the order of 100 fb while the pair production cross sections are smaller by a factor of around 2 .",
    "we postpone the study of event simulation to another paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we establish the model , discuss the new flavor mixing effects , and derive the new higgs and gauge couplings in section ii .",
    "we present the constraints from low - energy and higgs measurements in section iii .",
    "we also study the implications on top - quark fcnc processes @xmath29 . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the single and pair production for vlqs @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and thoroughly analyze the production mechanism in @xmath7 collisions .",

    "vltqs in a given multiplet state are degenerate , and denoted by @xmath76 . since the mass terms of vltqs do not involve the @xmath58 field and the associated operators are dimension-3 , the discrete @xmath49 symmetry is softly broken by @xmath77 terms .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath78 results in the mixture of the sm quarks and vltqs ; consequently , the @xmath56 coupling to the top quark is modified and the @xmath56 couplings to vltqs are induced . as a result , the sm higgs production cross section via gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) and its decays will be modified . in the next subsection , we discuss the modifications in detail .",
    "we note that the @xmath49 breaking effects will induce @xmath79 term through one - loop diagrams in the scalar potential .",
    "however , in addition to the suppression factor @xmath80 , the loop effects are suppressed by the small yukawa couplings @xmath78 ( see the detailed discussions later ) . as a result ,",
    "the induced vev of @xmath58 field and the induced mixing between @xmath56 and @xmath58 are small , and the br for @xmath81 decay is a factor of two smaller than that for @xmath82 decay  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the na62 experiment at cern can achieve the @xmath246 to be a precision of @xmath2  @xcite ; and the koto experiment at j - parc for @xmath247 decays can reach the sm sensitivity .",
    "thus , it is important to search for new physics in rare @xmath248 decays . in @xmath249-meson physics ,",
    "the tree - level couplings @xmath250 with @xmath251 can contribute to @xmath252 decays .",
    "although the measured @xmath253 is consistent with the sm prediction  @xcite , a @xmath254 deviation from the sm prediction in the angular analysis of @xmath255 is observed  @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to explore the excess in our model .",
    "since the detailed analysis of flavor physics is beyond the scope of this paper , a complete analysis will be studied elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the phenomenology of which two triplet vlqs with @xmath0 and a higgs singlet are embedded in the sm . because the isospin of vlqs is different from that of the sm quarks , higgs- and @xmath1-mediated fcncs are generated at the tree level and the new ckm matrix becomes a non - unitary matrix .",
    "we find that the modifications of the ckm matrix elements coupled to the sm quarks can be smeared out if two triplet vlqs are introduced and the scheme @xmath256 is adopted , where @xmath257 are the parameters from flavor mixings .",
    "although the tree - level fcncs can not be removed , it was found that when the constraints from @xmath30 processes are applied , the upper limits of brs for @xmath258 decays are @xmath259 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental bounds . with the values of constrained parameters",
    ", we examined the influence of the model on the sm higgs production and its diphoton decay ; we found that @xmath260 and @xmath261 can have @xmath262 and @xmath31 deviations from the sm results , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the signal strength for @xmath165 is thus changed by @xmath2 .",
    "the main purpose of this work was to explore the single production of exotic vlqs @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the @xmath7 collisions at @xmath8 tev .",
    "we gave a detailed analysis for each possible @xmath6 scattering , where @xmath204 and @xmath263 are the possible initial quarks .",
    "it was found that the contributions of @xmath264-channel annihilations are much smaller than those of @xmath265-channel annihilations . from this study , we comprehend the contribution of each subprocess to the production cross section of a specific vlq . the interesting production channels are @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 , where the corresponding production cross sections for @xmath12 tev are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 fb , respectively . from our analysis , it is clear to see that the single production cross sections of vlqs are much larger than the pair production cross sections , which are through qcd processes .",
    "the dominant decay modes of the vlqs are @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "each br can be 1/2 in our chosen scheme . for illustration",
    ", we estimate the significances for the channels proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : signal ] ) .",
    "it is found that the significance for @xmath18 channel can be over @xmath19 . + * acknowledgments *        g.  aad _ et al . _ [ atlas collaboration ] , `` observation of a new particle in the search for the standard model higgs boson with the atlas detector at the lhc '' , phys .",
