    "two news have recently kindled the field of the quasars and active galactic nuclei .",
    "the first concerns the farthest objects .",
    "not only single quasars ( qss ) have been detected at redshifts out to @xmath1 , but also the statistics at @xmath2 has improved to the point of outlining the bright section of the luminosity function ( fan et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "these findings confirm that the population of the optically selected objects goes through the most sharp and non - monotonic of evolutions .",
    "the comoving density of the bright sources rises on the scale of a few gyrs from the bang , to peak at around @xmath3 ( shaver et al .",
    "1996 ) ; later on it turns over and falls by factors @xmath4 toward us ( boyle et al .",
    "a similar message comes from the radio band , see jackson & wall ( 1999 ) .    the second piece of news concerns the cores of many local galaxies , where massive dark objects ( mdos ) ranging from a few @xmath5 to a some @xmath6 had been detected within regions from a few to tens of pcs , see richstone et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . now",
    "( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ) such masses are found to correlate tightly with the velocity dispersion in the body of the surrounding host galaxies .",
    "the mdo masses fit into the framework provided by the long standing arguments ( see lynden - bell 1969 ) that indicate gravitational contraction rather than thermonuclear burning to be the dominant source of qs output .",
    "we just recall this conclusion to hinge upon the high bolometric power @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 of many such sources , and on the high compactness with sizes down to @xmath9 cm indicated for some of them ; it also requires an overall efficiency up to @xmath10 for conversion of gravitational into radiative power .",
    "but then the argument may be carried on to evaluating the masses involved ( cavaliere et al .",
    "1983 ) ; in terms of @xmath11 these read @xmath12 where we have used @xmath13 erg s@xmath8 , @xmath14 cm , and the source life time @xmath15 gyr .",
    "such masses are consistent with the mdo observations .    here",
    "we intend to link the largest values of @xmath16 with the early qss , and to discuss how such a relation is to be extended into the range of lower redshifts and smaller masses .",
    "the accreting black hole ( bh ) paradigm not only best accounts for the small sizes and the top efficiencies required , but also provides to the spent masses the stability of a terminal configuration ( rees 1984 ) . nailing down the indication from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , a bh keeps full record of the mass @xmath17 accreted over the life of an active galactic nucleus .    meanwhile , the induced bolometric luminosities @xmath18 are tuned ( even at constant @xmath10 ) by the mass @xmath19 accreted over a time @xmath20 , and cover a wide dynamic range : from eddington _ self - limiting _ conditions governed by radiation pressure that yield @xmath21 erg s@xmath8 , to _ supply - limited _ accretion ( cavaliere & padovani 1989 ) that easily allows only sub - eddington emission .",
    "thus strong gravity is not enough . equally important",
    "are the _ environmental _ conditions in , or surrounding the host galaxy ; these can drive widely ranging accretion rates from @xmath22 or less , up to some @xmath23 yr@xmath8 .",
    "in addition , it is the cosmological change of the environment that qualifies to govern the qs evolution ; in fact , both occur on time scales @xmath24 a few gyrs such that @xmath25 holds .    in turn ,",
    "the environmental conditions are described by the other paradigm , the hierarchical growth and clustering of dark matter ( dm ) halos , wherein the galaxies constitute lighter baryonic cores ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "this implies substantial dynamical events to occur , at early @xmath0 in the strong form of merging between comparable subgalactic units , later on as milder interactions of galaxies in groups .",
    "all these dynamical events tend to break on scales of kpcs the axial symmetry of the galactic gravitational potential , or enhance its steady asymmetry ; relatedly , the specific angular momentum @xmath26 providing support to the gas in the central kpc of the host is not conserved , rather it is transferred to the massive dm component .",
    "thus the necessary condition is provided for destabilizing and funneling inward a sizeable gas fraction . at smaller scales",
    "dissipative processes take over to redistribute @xmath26 ( haehnelt & rees 1993 ) , and cause the gas to reach the nuclear accretion disk and grow new bhs or refuel the old ones .    to link bh growth and qs luminosities we follow cavaliere & vittorini ( 2000 ) and disentangle the triggering dynamical events into two main _ regimes _ , roughly divided by the epoch of group formation @xmath27 , depending on cosmological / cosmogonical parameters .",
    "the _ self - limited _ regime occurs mainly at epochs before @xmath29 , when galactic spheroids are built up through major merging events between halos with @xmath30 .",
    "these events destabilize large amounts of gas , but also replenish the host structures with fresh supplies and sustain the gas amount at the cosmic level @xmath31 .    as a consequence , central bhs can form and/or accrete rapidly , growing by @xmath32 over dynamical times close to the salpeter scale , @xmath33",
    "; so after eq .",
    "( 3 ) they attain eddington luminosities @xmath34 .    in turn",
    ", @xmath16 is related to @xmath35 ; two specific models bracket the processes involved , see cavaliere & vittorini 1998 ( cv98 ) , hosokawa et al .",
    "haehnelt & rees ( 1993 ) considered bh coalescence in parallel with merging of their halos ; this process ( hereafter model a ) is described by the simple scaling @xmath36 alternatively , haehnelt , natarajan & rees ( 1998 ) proposed the feedback - constrained model b where the scaling reads @xmath37 this is because during halo merging a central bh may also accrete gas up to the limit @xmath38 this is set by gas unbinding from the halo potential well , due to the deposition of an ( uncertain ) fraction @xmath39 of the qs radiation ( silk & rees 1998 ) .    with both models ( 4a ) and",
    "( 4b ) the early qss are expected to grow in average luminosity and in number , tracking the development of protogalactic halos over the range from @xmath40 toward @xmath41 .",
    "the evolving halo mass distribution is widely taken in the form @xmath42 first proposed by press & schechter ( 1974 ) ; the positive term of its time derivative provides the rate of halo formation , and yields ( see cv98 ) the luminosity function ( lf ) in the form @xmath43 with the prefactor @xmath44 accounting for the limited source lifetime .    fig .",
    "1 shows the optical lfs provided by such models .",
    "we stress that model ( 4b ) by the very means of its non - linear transformation stretches the halo distribution into flatter , more fitting lfs and predicts a stronger ( negative ) evolution . by the same token",
    ", it also associates bright qss with the largest galactic halos , consistent with the data discussed by hamilton , casertano & turnshek ( 2000 ) .",
    "both models are normalized to the data at @xmath45 . but model ( 4b ) privileges the upper halo range where @xmath46 decreases steeply , so it provides bh numbers smaller and naturally close to _ one _ large bh per actively star forming protogalaxy of intermediate ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) or large mass ( granato et al .",
    "2001 ) . in either model ,",
    "the early mass distribution @xmath47 is directly related to @xmath42 ; the model ( 4b ) yields the result represented by the thick solid line in fig .",
    "after @xmath50 the galaxies are assembled into small groups of mass @xmath51 , where the dominant member recurrently interacts with its companions , to the effect of refueling and rekindling an old bh ; growing evidence ( referenced in cv00 ) relates many qss with interacting hosts .",
    "small groups , with their high galaxies density and low velocity dispersion @xmath52 still close to the galaxian dispersion @xmath53 , constitute preferred sites for such interactions to occur .",
    "_ supply - limited _ accretion prevails here , since now the gas mass @xmath54 in the host is depleted but no longer replenished by the interactions .",
    "still , considerable fractions of the gas initially orbiting in the host at @xmath55 kpc are destabilized and partly made available for accretion ; such fractions are easily evaluated ( see cv00 ) in the form @xmath56 this includes the host structural parameter @xmath57 , taken to be close to @xmath53 ; it also includes encounter orbital parameters : the impact parameter @xmath58 , the relative velocity @xmath52 , and the partner mass @xmath59 .",
    "truly tidal interactions imply a postfactor @xmath60 .    with @xmath61 and @xmath58 bounded by the group radius ,",
    "interactions and gas inflow both take times @xmath62 @xmath63 gyr .",
    "the above equation easily yields @xmath64 in excess of a few @xmath65 , of which about @xmath66 may reach the nucleus while the rest is likely to end up in circumnuclear starbursts , see sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) , cv00 .",
    "this is enough to produce ( see eq .",
    "3 ) outputs @xmath67 erg @xmath68 in a host still gas rich with @xmath69 .",
    "fractions up to @xmath70 are indicated by eq .",
    "( 7 ) , and in fact obtain in numerical simulations of grazing collisions , which are statistically fewer .",
    "the full probability of accreting a fraction @xmath71 is calculated by cv00 to read @xmath72 on the basis of eq .",
    "( 7 ) ; this defines range and shape of the lf .    in time , many small groups merge into richer ones where interactions are less frequent and effective .",
    "their volume density , grown rapidly later than @xmath29 , at low @xmath0 goes down into a demise @xmath73 ; in addition , the decreasing interaction rate @xmath74gyr@xmath8 lowers the number of activated sources .",
    "the result for the qs population is a moderate  density evolution \" proportional to @xmath75 . but a stronger `` luminosity evolution '' occurs since on average @xmath76 holds , and the residual host gas @xmath77 is depleted on a scale @xmath78 as it is destabilized and used up in accretion episodes and by accompanying nuclear starbursts , with no replenishment .",
    "as @xmath79 decreases and @xmath16 increases , the sources on average go toward sub - eddington luminosities , consistent with the data in salucci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , wandel ( 1999 ) .",
    "for early bhs growing at @xmath81 the models ( 4a ) or ( 4b ) imply different scaling relations , that read @xmath82 or @xmath83 respectively .",
    "these stem from the simple hierarchical scaling of @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 for the surrounding dm halos , as is appropriate for @xmath87 @xmath41 when one galaxy per halo occurs . in such conditions",
    ", it is also fair to assume @xmath88 @xmath52 , and to fix the @xmath0-dependent fuzz appearing only in eq .",
    "( 8a ) on relating the density to @xmath35 by means of @xmath89 , that holds for hierarchically formed halos ( see haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ) .    the relations ( 8a ) , ( 8b ) turn out to be in tune with the current debate concerning the mdo data .",
    "these have been recently recognized to follow a tight and steep correlation ; the precise slope is given as slightly flatter than @xmath90 by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , or close to @xmath91 by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) . in either case",
    "the scatter is found to be rather small , that is , factors @xmath92 or less in @xmath16 at given @xmath53 . note from fig .",
    "1 that lfs flat as observed at high @xmath0 obtain from model ( 4a ) only upon convolution with scatter larger than @xmath93 , as discussed by haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) .",
    "later than @xmath94 fewer new bhs are still produced , but the early ones still grow after @xmath95 , due to additional but dwindling accretion events @xmath96 caused by host interactions .",
    "the latter cause the mass distribution @xmath97 to evolve as given by @xmath98~. \\eqno ( 9)\\ ] ] following up  4 , @xmath99 is the fraction of host galaxies residing in a group , relative to total bh number including the dormant ones ; for it we take values of order @xmath100 as discussed in cv00 , based on the fraction @xmath66 of bright galaxies found by ramella et al . ( 1999 ) to reside in groups with membership 3 or larger .",
    "the right hand side describes the net change at @xmath0 of the distribution @xmath97 , due to an accretion episode of @xmath101 which upgrades the initial mass @xmath102 to the current value @xmath16 ; the probability for this to occur is @xmath103 , and the factor provided by the interaction frequency @xmath104 converts it to a rate .",
    "the numerical solution plotted in fig .",
    "2 shows how @xmath105  starting from the condition at @xmath106 computed in  3  drifts and diffuses in time toward higher @xmath16 , but only up to a cutoff ; this is due to the large values of @xmath71 being rare , and to @xmath77 being depleted from its initial value @xmath107 .",
    "so the additions @xmath108 decrease on average , and large @xmath16 are unlikely to grow much larger .",
    "we derive the corresponding @xmath109 relation noting from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that the gas masses available for accretion follow @xmath110 . on adopting the scaling @xmath111 indicated by the faber - jackson relation or produced by stellar feedback ,",
    "the result is @xmath112 .",
    "if used in full , such masses dominate at low @xmath113 km s@xmath8 , to yield maximal @xmath16 values scaling as @xmath114 see fig .",
    "the scatter is within an overall factor @xmath115 , the effective range given by the steep form of @xmath103 .",
    "truly tidal interactions ( see the comment under eq . 7 ) yield a somewhat steeper scaling @xmath116 and more scatter .",
    "but  given that enough gas is made available by the interactions as shown in  4  the mass actually accreted may still be _ constrained _ by the qs feedback , depending on the degree of coupling of the source output to the surrounding baryons . here",
    "we focus on the 90% radio quiet sources where the output is mostly radiative and roughly isotropic . at low @xmath0 the unbinding constraint similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) reads @xmath117 with @xmath118 , the masses accreted in a host with @xmath119 @xmath120 km s@xmath8 are constrained to stay under those made available by interactions and given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) ; using again @xmath121 , here the result is @xmath122 .",
    "these moderate additions drive considerably less evolution of @xmath105 as represented by the thin solid line in fig .",
    "2 ; then @xmath16 is always dominated by the initial values which follow eq . ( 8b ) , and will in fact converge to values scaling as @xmath123 .    the full scaling laws given by eqs . ( 8b ) with ( 11 ) , or by ( 8a ) with ( 10 ) , are represented in fig .",
    "they differ mostly in the lower left section , where data are difficult to obtain from the kinematics of stars or of a nuclear disk .",
    "we conclude that the relic bh masses are related to the host galaxy dispersions by the _ steep _ correlation @xmath124 if qs feedback onto the host s gas always provides the main constraint to the accretion .",
    "in other words , this form is to hold at all @xmath53 if the host potential well _ bounds _ the actual accretion rates all the way from early bh formation to later additional growth .    on the other hand ,",
    "if such a control was never the limiting factor we expect the softer ( and fuzzier ) correlation @xmath125 to hold at high @xmath53 , and this to _ soften _ yet at lower @xmath53 to the form @xmath126 set by the production rate of the available gas .    these two extremes _ bracket _ the qs and bh story .",
    "the latter is centered on one kind of engine , the bh based on strong gravity ; but it comprises different regimes of fueling , that is , of accretion and growth triggered by the environment under weak gravity .    at early @xmath127 much fresh gas",
    "is made available for full , self - limiting accretion by major merging events which build up the halos and the embedded spheroids .",
    "bhs grow rapidly , generating the upper section of the correlation @xmath128 .",
    "meanwhile , the associated qss flare up at eddington luminosities ; their lf grows in range and height , tracking the progressive halo build up .",
    "later than @xmath129 the dearth of gas curbs the accretion and bends down the qs evolution , as host interactions with group companions are still able to trigger accretion but no longer to import fresh gas . though supply - limited , the gas masses made available for accretion are still sizeable .",
    "if these are used in full , the average luminosities are still high and the bhs still grow considerably ; relatedly , the correlation is softened to @xmath130 in its lower section .    at @xmath0 lower yet , the host gas reservoirs approach exhaustion , and weaker agn activity may be sustained by lesser gas productions or smaller supplies provided , e.g. , by internal instabilities ( see heller & shlosman 1994 , merritt 1999 ) or by satellite galaxies cannibalized by the hosts ( cv00 ) .",
    "these latest and smaller accretion events can fuel many weaker agns more likely to be pinpointed in x - rays , implying widespread accretion power but moderate growth of individual bhs , as also argued by salucci et al .",
    "deep surveys in hard x - rays are now uncovering optically hidden , and even x - ray obscured accretion power , as they resolve and count the agns that dominate the hard xrb ( see giacconi et al .",
    "2001 , hasinger et al .",
    "2001 ) ; the indications are currently favoring agns of intermediate powers and redshifts as main xrb contributors ( see comastri et al .",
    "2001 ) . these findings jointly with the scanty evidence of , and the indirect bounds to a qs 2 population ( see maiolino et al . 2001 ) suggest to us that the optical - ir sampling is fair to within a factor 2 as for the outputs of early and luminous qss , and is reliable for linking these with the largest bhs .",
    "first , the largest mdos in local inactive galaxies are directly _ linked _ with the high-@xmath0 luminous qss . in particular",
    ", we have shown that _ flat _ optical lfs given by the feedback - constrained model ( 4b )",
    "are linked to the _ steep _ and _ tight _ correlation given at large masses by @xmath131 ( see eq . 8b ) .",
    "current evidence concerning high brightness of the hosts ( see  3 ) , flat shape of the high-@xmath0 lfs (  3 ) , and narrow scatter in the @xmath109 correlation (  5 ) concur to favor this specific link . but telling data will be provided by the precise slope of the upper mdo correlation observed locally in the optical band , jointly with the rate of qs decline toward high @xmath0 derived from large area surveys out to the near - ir like the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "second and concerning the lower region of the @xmath16@xmath53 plane , it is conceivable ( within the present uncertainties about @xmath132 ) that the fuel throttle to the bh engine is always controlled by the host wells as is expressed by eq . ( 11 ) ; if so , the main accretion modes may be effectively united by the feedback action . in  5",
    "we have shown that this provides the _ lower _ bound to @xmath16 expressed again by @xmath133 .",
    "on the other hand , an _",
    "bound @xmath126 is set by the condition of maximal fuel availability , eq .",
    "( 10 ) ; this includes the production of optically obscured accretion power .",
    "note that the highly obscured , wind blowing bhs suggested by fabian ( 1999 ) would be located in between .",
    "the actual feedback action will be observationally probed by the slope of the @xmath109 correlation in its lower section ; here the growing reverberation map database ( see ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 ) in current agns will be telling .",
