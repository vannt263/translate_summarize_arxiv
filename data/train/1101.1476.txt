    "casimir forces @xcite have been investigated since their inception as a macroscopic test of the irreducible fluctuations associated to quantum fields .",
    "they are geometrical in character , as they originate from the possibility to confine and shape the energy density of quantum fluctuations using proper boundary conditions .",
    "so far , the experimental attention has been mainly focused on the original parallel plate configuration @xcite , and the sphere - plane geometry @xcite , apart from the only experiment performed in a crossed - cylinder configuration @xcite .",
    "further motivations to pursue precision studies of the casimir forces are related to the possibility to discover new forces of strength similar or larger than the newtonian gravitational coupling but with short - range or different distance scaling and expected to act , according to various models , in the submillimeter range @xcite .",
    "this can be considered part of a broader program aimed at testing deviations from newtonian gravitation in the nonrelativistic limit @xcite . in",
    "the micrometer range the dominant source of background to non - newtonian gravitational forces is provided by casimir forces @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) and to discover such forces , or at least to provide reliable limits on their existence , one must control at the highest level of accuracy all systematic sources of deviation from the idealized case analyzed by casimir in his original paper .",
    "major sources of systematic errors that are still considered under partial control are the use of the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite for curved surfaces , the presence of electric forces not reflected in the purely coulombian contribution , such as patch effects @xcite , and the combined effect of finite conductivity and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the use of the pfa has been discussed at length in the literature , with several alternative methods developed to overcome its limitations , and exact solutions have been found in particular curved geometries .",
    "it is generally assumed that the pfa for the casimir force differs from the exact result by an amount smaller than 0.1 @xmath0 , an assumption compatible with the results of a dedicated experiment @xcite .",
    "the control on the pfa used to assess limits to yukawian",
    "non - newtonian gravity has not been addressed until very recently , although it has been used for many years @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the usual form of pfa can not be extended unambiguously to volumetric forces @xcite , and thereafter an alternative form of the pfa has been discussed @xcite , which , however , has been shown in @xcite to coincide with the exact formula for geometries in which one of the two bodies has translational invariance .",
    "the presence of electric forces not incorporated in the coulombian contribution has been discussed extensively in the literature , in particular in @xcite .",
    "anomalies in the electrostatic calibrations of the sphere - plane configuration have been evidenced for large radii of curvature of the sphere and small distances from the planar surface @xcite .",
    "this has triggered discussions about the nature and the universality of the observed anomalies @xcite , and the situation is still far from being clarified .",
    "the anomalous exponent optimizing the fit of the electrostatic calibrations in @xcite has _ not _ been found in another experiment using spheres of much smaller diameter located at similar distances from the planar surface @xcite , while the dependence of the minimizing potential on the sphere - plane separation reported in @xcite has been confirmed in @xcite , and for crystalline ge in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a discussion of some unpublished data from former experiments ) .",
    "the spatial and temporal variabilities of the minimizing potential has been evidenced in a centimeter - size torsional balance @xcite , which confirms the necessity for a detailed knowledge of the surfaces and their preparation @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature contribution added to the quantum fluctuations has originated a lengthy debate about the interplay of the thermal contribution with the finite conductivity properties of the surfaces ( see for instance @xcite for the initial steps of the debate ) .",
    "on the experimental side , attempts to evidence the thermal contribution discriminating various models have been reported for the sphere - plane geometry @xcite , while proposals using torsional balances in the parallel plane configuration @xcite are under development . a dedicated experiment in the parallel plane configuration using microresonators @xcite and",

    "i.e. _ the cylinder - plane geometry , has been proposed , and its experimental feasibility was investigated at gaps of the order of 20 @xmath6 m , limited by the roughness of the metallic surfaces @xcite .",
    "this geometry is very relevant from the theoretical viewpoint , since an exact solution for the casimir force has been found @xcite , also providing another example of curved geometry in which pfa may be tested against numerical techniques @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the results of electrostatic calibrations for an apparatus using the cylinder - plane geometry in a range of distances of relevance for measuring the casimir force .",
    "we observe a background originating frequency shifts of amplitude large enough to overwhelm the downshift expected from the casimir force .",
    "we also discuss the distance dependence of the contact potential in both the cylinder - plane and parallel plates configurations . the minimizing potential shows no significant distance dependence in the parallel plates configuration with respect to corresponding cases of the cylinder - plane and sphere - plane configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec , ii we briefly recall the coulomb force in the cylinder - plane geometry , and report on the upgrades to the apparatus with respect to the one described in @xcite , its overall sensitivity performance , its geometrical characterization , and the parallelization technique . in sec .",
    "iii we describe results from electrostatic calibrations , showing that in analogy to the sphere - plane case we observe that ( a ) the optimal exponent for fitting the dependence of the coulomb coupling on distance is not the one expected from the idealized situation , at least at the smallest explored distances between the cylinder and the plane and ( b ) that the minimizing potential depends on distance .",
    "we then describe the data analysis leading to force residuals after subtraction of the coulombian contribution . at the smallest explored gaps we observe residual frequency shifts of amplitude large enough to prevent the measurement of the casimir force . the presence of shifts neither of coulomb nor of casimir origin has been confirmed by implementing a measurement strategy consisting in progressively approaching the two surfaces at constant bias voltage , and measuring the resonator frequency . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss possible explanations for the unexpected scaling law of the coulomb interaction with distance .",
    "we then describe in sec . v electrostatic calibrations taken in a parallel plane geometry aimed at evidencing the dependence on distance of the minimizing potential also in this configuration , thereby completing the analysis for the three most common geometries of experimental interest .",
    "the relevance of measuring and modeling the dependence of the minimizing potential on distance in order to detect the thermal contribution to the casimir force is discussed in sec .",
    "vi . in the conclusion",
    "we put our findings in the more general framework of the recent observations of systematic effects highlighting possible future developments for the cylinder - plane geometry .",
    "the theory related to the cylinder - plane geometry and a description of the apparatus have been the subject of a former paper @xcite , while further details of the measurement technique have been reported in @xcite .",
    "the main difference from the former tests is due to the use of high - quality au - coated cylindrical lenses , with planarity and roughness comparable to the ones of the resonator , therefore allowing us to reach submicrometer gaps .    the electrostatic force between a conducting cylinder ( of length @xmath7 , radius @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ) parallel to a conducting planar surface , separated by a gap @xmath10 and kept at a fixed electrostatic potential difference @xmath11 is @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with the approximate expression in the right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) valid in the limit @xmath15 , also coinciding with the result expected from the pfa for electrostatics .",
    "since both the cantilever and the cylinder have finite size , the length @xmath7 in the previous expressions should be replaced by an effective length @xmath16 that characterizes the relative exposure between the cantilever and the lens , ( _ i.e. _ the minimum between the width of the cantilever and the length of the cylinder ) . in our initial experimental attempts",
    "this corresponded to the cantilever width .",
    "however , by visual and optical microscope analysis we noticed the presence of sharp irregularities at the border of the cantilever , most likely originated by the laser cutting process of the si wafer .",
    "we have then chosen cylindrical lenses of length @xmath5 mm smaller than the resonator width of 10 mm ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , as the lenses seem to have more regular borders , as visible at the optical microscope . at this point",
    "we should note that the curvature of our cylindrical lens is @xmath4 mm , larger than its length @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that border effects in the electrostatic interaction between the cylinder and the cantilever can be important , and the exact logarithmic expression of the electrostatic force in eq.([forcesmythe ] ) should not hold in our configuration .",
    "however , as long as the conditions for the pfa hold ( @xmath15 ) the approximate expression for the force as given by the r.h.s . in eq.([forcesmythe",
    "] ) should apply , irrespective of the relative magnitude of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "other important geometrical issues are the possible nonperfect parallelization between the cylinder and the cantilever and the use of a cylindrical lens rather than a full cylinder . in @xcite , the correction to the pfa expression for the force [ r.h.s .",
    "( [ forcesmythe ] ) ] due to nonparallelism was computed    @xmath17 , \\label{emnonparallel}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the deviation angle from ideal parallelism , and in this nonparallel case the distance @xmath10 between the cantilever and the cylinder is measured from the midpoint along the axis of the cylinder .",
    "the use of a cylindrical lens rather than a full cylinder can be simply evaluated in pfa @xcite , resulting in a subleading pfa correction ( of the order of @xmath20 for a typical separation of @xmath21 ) , and will be then discarded in what follows .    to calibrate the apparatus , a controllable electrostatic force is generated by applying bias voltages between the cantilever and the cylindrical lens . at a given separation , the frequency of a resonant mode characterized by an effective mass @xmath22 is measured both with ( @xmath23 ) and without ( @xmath24 ) the presence of the voltage .",
    "this allows for the evaluation of the square frequency difference @xmath25 , related to the voltage @xmath11 in the pfa ( @xmath15 ) as    @xmath26 , \\label{cpelectro}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the minimizing potential . for small tilting angles @xmath28 the correction to the frequency shift due to nonparallelism",
    "has a quadratic dependence on @xmath29 , given as @xmath30 .",
    "the parallelization procedure is one - dimensional , thereby simpler than in the case of two flat surfaces . rather than measuring the frequency shift induced by a constant bias voltage as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "we have opted to monitor the cylinder - plane capacitance using a capacitive ac bridge @xcite .",
    "using the pfa , the capacitance between the cylinder and the plane is given by    @xmath31    the tilting angle @xmath19 ( and therefore @xmath29 in turn ) is controlled through two motorized actuators acting in differential mode , with the goal to keep the average distance @xmath10 ( the separation between the plate and the cylinder as measured from the midpoint of the cylinder ) constant while changing the tilting angle ( see fig .",
    "the precision of the achieved parallelism is then determined by the quality of the fitting of the capacitance versus differential steps number , propagated to determine the dispersion on the number of steps at minima compatible with the fitting error",
    ".    the precision can be improved by minimizing stray capacitance between various contacts since the precision of the capacitance meter is some percentage of the total capacitance in the system , usually @xmath32 .",
    "an example of parallelization through capacitance measurements is shown in fig .",
    "the use of long - range actuators has been shown to be problematic due to large hysteresis , and therefore we have opted for a fine tuning with the use of two piezoelectric actuators as in the schematics shown in the left plot of fig .",
    "1 . an optical microscope allows to monitor the quality and cleanness of the two surfaces and for a visual , qualitative assessment of the parallelization .",

    "an important prerequisite to any casimir force measurement is the execution of high - quality electrostatic calibrations .",
    "forces are always indirectly measured via their functional relationship to more accessible observables , such as detection of deflection angles , voltages required to keep the apparatus at rest in closed loop schemes , or shifts of the frequency of a mode of a resonator as in our case .",
    "it is then crucial to convert such quantities more directly observed into the corresponding force signal by means of well - known and controllable physical signals , for instance by applying external bias voltages and comparing the measured forces with the coulombian interactions between macroscopic conducting bodies .",
    "the electrostatic calibration starts by finding the best parallelization condition at a given nominal cylinder - plane separation @xmath10 using the capacitance technique described previously .",
    "then the parallelization is further fine tuned by adjusting the two lateral piezoelectric actuators @xmath42 .",
    "once the optimal parallel condition is obtained , @xmath42 are left untouched , and the separation @xmath10 is changed via the central piezoelectric actuator @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure keeps the parallelization at the optimal value .",
    "as seen previously , in the perfect parallel situation the frequency shift of the cantilever due to pure electrostatics takes the form    @xmath44    the displacement of the central piezo @xmath43 depends linearly on the voltage applied @xmath34 , and therefore the absolute gap is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 nm / v is the actuation coefficient of the piezoelectric transducer , and @xmath47 is the pzt voltage required to make contact between the two surfaces . at a given distance ,",
    "the electrostatic calibration has been performed by measuring the frequency shift induced by a range of electric voltages @xmath11 applied between the two surfaces .",
    "the curvature coefficient @xmath48 and the minimizing potential @xmath27 can then be obtained by fitting the data with    @xmath49    where @xmath50 .",
    "this fitting procedure allows the determination of the absolute distance @xmath10 once the fitting parameter @xmath47 is obtained , and the measurement of the contact potential @xmath27 as a function of @xmath10 . a typical data plot of @xmath35 _ vs. _ @xmath34 is shown in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : optimalexponent ] .",
    "the blue curves are the best fits using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : kel_vs_d ] ) , and they deviate significantly from the data points , both including or excluding a curvature offset @xmath51 representing a hypothetical background electric field .",
    "moreover , the effective mass calculated from the fitting parameter is 30 - 50 times larger than the physical mass , much larger than the expected value of the effective mass which should be comparable or smaller than the physical mass of the resonator . if instead the power exponent is left as a free parameter , rather than being fixed at 2.5 , a new fitting curve with the exponent in the 0.9 to 1.3 range is obtained ( the red curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : optimalexponent ] ) .",
    "this deviation from the expected exponent for the coulombian force has been confirmed to exist in all our electrostatic calibrations data .",
    "table i shows the fitting parameters of the electrostatic calibrations for five runs both when the exponent is fixed and left as a free parameter .",
    "the effective mass for the latter case is not well defined because of the deviation of the exponent from 2.5 , thus it is not listed .",
    "as shown in table i , the exponent , when left as a free parameter , is always smaller than the theoretical value of 2.5 , with a reduced @xmath36 smaller by about an order of magnitude with respect to the one expected from the coulombian scaling .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath36 also indicates that the errors may be underestimated , although this does not affect our conclusions about the relative comparison between coulombian and optimal exponents .",
    "while small deviations from 2.5 are expected considering all the less than ideal conditions such as imperfect parallelization and thermal and mechanical drifts , such a significant difference ( an average value of 1.03 versus 2.5 ) can not be explained as small deviations from ideality .",
    ".fitting parameters of the electrostatic calibrations using the curvature technique . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , with an al coating , the lowest value of @xmath35 achieved is much smaller than that of the au and ag mirrors .",
    "this may be due to the easiness to form oxide layers , and it could also be related to the smaller conductivity with respect to al and au . in this case",
    "the residual potential @xmath27 is also constant at small separation gaps as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : plates ] , and it is manifest that @xmath27 is significantly larger than that for au and ag mirrors .",
    "a more quantitative analysis is precluded by the strong dependence of the work function of al on the exposure time in air @xcite .    a comparison among the various minimizing potentials @xmath27 and physical parameters of the substrate is shown in the second part of table iii .",
    "the average values of @xmath27 are obtained by averaging three runs from each mirror weighted by their variance . from the table",
    "it is clear that @xmath27 for mirrors coated with au , ag , and al are significantly different .",
    "for a rough theoretical comparison , the work function and the fermi energy as well as their difference are also listed in the table .",
    "the work function of a metal is closely related to its fermi energy , but due to the presence of defects and impurities on the surface these two quantities do not coincide , with their difference largely due to the surface charge distribution and surface dipole distribution . from table",
    "iii we can see that au has the smallest difference between its work function and fermi energy while al has the largest . since this difference indicates the magnitude of the surface charge and dipole distribution which may be directly related to the residual potential @xmath27 , it could be used to explain the different value of @xmath27 measured using mirror with different coatings .",
    "in fact the average @xmath27 values for au , ag , and al mirrors is consistent with the order of this difference .",
    "regarding the best fitting exponent for the scaling of the curvature coefficient with distance , we have obtained the expected one from coulomb force , although it should be noticed that the range of distances was limited to a minimum value of about 3 @xmath6 m .",
    "our emphasis on measuring the minimizing potential at all the explored distances for the sphere - plane configuration @xcite , and for the cylinder - plane and parallel planes configurations described here , is due to the fact that the understanding of the minimizing potential dependence on distance and time is crucial for the assessment of the accuracy of the casimir force measurements at small ( below @xmath52 m ) distances , and for determining the thermal contribution at large ( in the 1 - 5 @xmath6 m range ) distances . in table",
    "iv we report the formulas for the ideal ( perfect reflectors , zero temperature ) casimir force and for the coulomb force in the three different geometries . following @xcite ,",
    "let us define the equivalent casimir voltage as the external bias voltage that can simulate the ideal casimir force .",
    "due to the different scalings with distance of casimir and coulomb forces , this equivalent casimir voltage must be specified at each distance .",
    "it is , however , important to point out that the difference between the various geometries is just a numerical factor which makes this equivalent voltage for the sphere - plane configuration about half the value of the parallel plane case ( with the cylinder - plane , as is customary , in between the two extreme cases even from this point of view ) .",
    "the formula for the equivalent casimir voltage is @xmath53 where @xmath54=360 , 192 , and 120 for the sphere - plane , cylinder - plane , and parallel plate configurations , respectively .    in the numerical example presented in the last raw of table iv , at a distance of 1 @xmath6 m , which can be considered the borderline between the short - distance regime and the long - distance regime in which the thermal contribution starts to play a significant role , this equivalent casimir voltage ranges between 10 and 17 mv depending on the geometry . at 3 @xmath6 m , where the thermal contribution is expected to contribute as 10 - 20 @xmath0 of the total force signal , with an absolute value still large enough to be detectable in various apparata ,",
    "the equivalent casimir voltage is three times smaller ( _ i.e. _ between 3 and 6 mv ) .",
    "this voltage is of the same order of magnitude of the variation of the minimizing potential in a range of few micrometers . to take into account this contribution to properly subtract it from the data",
    ", it is therefore necessary to model the minimizing potential at the few percent level accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , such stringent theoretical characterization of the minimizing potential is not yet available",
    ".    a further degree of uncertainty is also related to the fact that , as pointed out in @xcite , the minimizing potential may depend on time , a fact that , for instance , could be attributed to temperature drifts .",
    "it has been experimentally shown in @xcite using a heated atomic force microscope tip that the contact potential depends on temperature , with a slope estimated to be of the order of 4 mv/@xmath55c . to perform high - precision tests of the casimir force ,",
    "one therefore needs a stringent temperature stability of the apparatus during the entire measurement run . in @xcite , the observation of fast changes in the contact potential",
    "have been conjectured as due to the effect of background cosmic rays impinging on the apparatus . for a release of about 10@xmath56 c/@xmath57 through ionization by cosmic rays at sea level , and considering the small values of the capacitances ( order of hundreds pf ) , sudden changes of order 0.1 - 1 mv",
    "could be expected ( see @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "a careful control of the minimizing potential will then require also surrounding the apparatus with lead shields to reduce the radiation background or particle detectors to veto the apparatus during large ionization events , especially for apparata using microspheres .",
    "in this paper we have summarized the main outcomes from our effort to measure the casimir force in the cylinder - plane configuration .",
    "the presence of uncontrollable frequency shifts of electric origin at the smallest explored gaps , evidenced both from the analysis of the residuals of the electrostatic calibrations and a fast - approach technique , prevent us from identifying a casimir - like contribution at small distance . at large distances",
    "thermal drifts are large , if compared to the expected casimir force , and a careful control of the dependence of the minimizing potential on distance is also required to extract meaningful information about the casimir force and its thermal corrections . while unsuccessful , our search for the casimir force in this geometry , apart from the development of some data taking and analysis techniques applicable elsewhere , has evidenced a number of features which may be of more general interest , as we try to summarize in the following .    first , we have observed anomalous behavior for the best fitting exponent with which the electrostatic coefficient is scaling as a function of the cylinder - plane separation .",
    "the exponent is significantly smaller than the coulombian one at small distances , while it retains its expected value at the largest explored gaps . in the case of the sphere - plane measurements , the exponent was slightly smaller than the expected value but it retained its value in the entire explored range of distances , this last being smaller than in the cylinder - plane case due to the smaller electrostatic signal available in the sphere - plane configuration @xcite .",
    "second , we have observed a dependence of the minimizing potential on the cylinder - plane distance , similarly to the sphere - plane case .",
    "although its dependence is milder at small distances , it still retains a strong dependence on distance at larger gaps , and this requires a careful modeling to subtract its contribution when studying forces in the 1 - 5 @xmath6 m range of interest to discriminate among the various models proposed to incorporate the thermal contribution .",
    "finally , we have also explored the case of flat surfaces with a rough parallelization and we have found that in this case no anomalous behavior is observed for both the scaling exponent and the minimizing potential , even using different substrates for the surfaces . the range of explored distances is definitely limited by the approximate two - dimensional parallelism achievable with our setup , and it is therefore unclear if anomalous scaling could be instead observed as in the case of the smaller explored gaps in the sphere - plane and cylinder - plane configurations . both apparata built to study the casimir forces in a parallel plane configuration have not observed dependence of the minimizing potential on distance @xcite .",
    "our findings should be then related to recent outcomes from various experiments confirming the presence of nontrivial , formerly unidentified systematic effects in the electrostatic calibrations @xcite .",
    "several recent experiments are also showing that the observation of casimir or casimir - polder forces is less trivial than previously stated , for instance , with regards to the dependence on the optical properties of the substrates @xcite and the presence of dielectric layers on the substrates @xcite .",
    "theoretical arguments have been recently provided for the nontrivial interplay between thermal fluctuations and geometry @xcite , thermal , conductivity , and roughness corrections @xcite and the role of the statistical properties of the conducting surfaces @xcite .",
    "deviations from the pure coulombian contribution and from the hypothesis of a constant minimizing potential have also been observed in atomic force microscopy for sharp tips , for instance , due to capillary forces @xcite .",
