    "each of the repeaters will be moving at a smaller speed than the original ship ( see figure [ redchan ] , left ) and the analysis is totally equivalent to the gravitational well example . with a few repeaters we can greatly improve the capacity until we are close to the limiting case with no relativistic effects .",

    ", we have an additional source of delay , which is the time it takes the data to zigzag through all the repeaters .",
    "additionally , if capacity tends to infinity , we also need an infinite buffer at the repeaters .    taking these factors into account , the scenarios of the previous section where @xmath73 seem more natural .",
    "the space journey example , for instance , is close to what we can expect for a real interplanetary mission , where distant repeaters have not been deployed and we have a limited speed ( below the speed of light ) .",
    "we have seen the differences between relativistic and nonrelativistic communication .",
    "the maximum communication rate between two observers depends on their state of motion and whether there is a gravitational field or not .",
    "communication between observers going away from each other or climbing up a gravitational potential is less efficient than the communication between observers with no relative motion and far from any mass . a transmission between approaching observers or a communication going down a gravitational potential can be done at a higher rate .    introducing intermediate nodes with a decode - and - forward strategy",
    "has no effect in the nonrelativistic capacity . in relativistic channels where",
    "only the receiver adds noise , we can improve the less efficient cases and , in some cases , we can even attain arbitrarily high capacities .",
    "there are many interesting generalizations to the repeater channel we have introduced .",
    "our starting point has been a nonrelativistic decode - and - forward strategy .",
    "the decode - and - forward channel is a particular , trivial case of the relay channel @xcite .",
