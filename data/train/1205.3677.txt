    "in the cuprates , high - temperature superconductivity is separated from antiferromagnetism by a pseudo - gap regime .",
    "it has been conjectured that the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom in the pseudo - gap regime are responsible for superconductivity as well . reliably identifying those degrees of freedom by theoretical investigations",
    "is a highly non - trivial task , because unbiased first principles analytic or numerical calculations in microscopic systems such as the hubbard or @xmath1-@xmath2 model are presently out of reach . in lightly doped antiferromagnets , on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is more favorable .",
    "first of all , precise numerical simulations of undoped antiferromagnets @xcite,(such as the heisenberg model ) are possible with the loop - cluster algorithm @xcite , and individual doped holes can also be simulated reliably @xcite .",
    "second , the low - energy dynamics of lightly doped antiferromagnets can be described with a systematic effective field theory for magnons and holes .",
    "the pure magnon effective field theory has been developed in @xcite and is completely analogous to chiral perturbation theory for the goldstone pions in qcd @xcite . in the past few years",
    ", the systematic effective theory for magnons and doped holes has been constructed @xcite in complete analogy to baryon chiral perturbation theory  the effective theory for pions and nucleons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous attempts to construct effective theories for magnons and holes in a square lattice antiferromagnet @xcite , the construction of @xcite is based on a systematic symmetry analysis and provides a complete set of all terms contributing to the effective action at leading and sub - leading order . as a result ,",
    "the predictions of the effective theory are exact , order by order in a systematic derivative expansion .",
    "in particular , the low - energy physics of any lightly doped antiferromagnet is described quantitatively once some low - energy parameters ( such as the spin stiffness or the spinwave velocity of the underlying microscopic system ) have been fixed either by experiment or by numerical simulations .",
    "the effective theory has been used in systematic studies of magnon - mediated two - hole bound states @xcite and of spiral phases @xcite .",
    "earlier ( but somewhat less systematic ) studies had been presented in @xcite .",
    "systematic effective field theories have also been constructed for antiferromagnets on a honeycomb lattice @xcite , as well as for lightly electron - doped antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , before one enters the high - temperature superconductor or even just the pseudo - gap regime , both antiferromagetism and the systematic effective theory that describes it break down . while one might expect that one can hence not learn anything about high - temperature superconductivity or the pseudo - gap regime from the effective theory , the situation may not be entirely hopeless .",
    "in particular , the effective theory still contains information about what objects may form when the theory is about to break down . in this way",
    ", we can identify new candidate low - energy degrees of freedom for which another effective theory with an extended validity range can be constructed . in this paper , we do not yet attempt to construct an effective field theory for the pseudo - gap regime . instead , we concentrate on the identification of new low - energy objects that may form when antiferromagnetism is about to break down .    when antiferromagnetism is weakened , the spin stiffness @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "in particular , if antiferromagnetism is ultimately destroyed in a second order phase transition , @xmath3 vanishes at the transition .",
    "a small value of @xmath3 favors topological excitations in the staggered magnetization  the order parameter for antiferromagnetism . in @xmath4 dimensions ,",
    "the topological excitations of the staggered magnetization vector are skyrmions which carry a topologically conserved winding number @xmath5 = { { \\mathbb{z}}}$ ] in the second homotopy group of the order parameter manifold @xmath6 .",
    "the coset space @xmath7 arises because in an antiferromagnet the @xmath8 spin symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the subgroup @xmath9 .",
    "the possible role of skyrmions as relevant excitations in quantum antiferromagnets has been discussed in several publications @xcite .",
    "haldane was first to realize that skyrmions in an antiferromagnet are associated with a geometric phase @xcite .",
    "when skyrmions proliferate , antiferromagnetic order is destroyed .",
    "read and sachdev showed that on a square lattice the skyrmion s geometric phase then implies a competing valence bond solid order with 4-fold degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the interplay of geometric phases and competing orders has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the suppression of skyrmions has been related to unconventional deconfined quantum critical points @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that a hole localized near a dopant stabilizes a skyrmion texture in the staggered magnetization @xcite .",
    "the analogies between pions in qcd and magnons in ferro- and antiferromagnets have been investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was argued that skyrmions endowed with fermion number 2 may act as preformed cooper pairs of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "experimental evidence for skyrmions in the lightly doped insulating antiferromagnet @xmath10 in an external magnetic field has been reported in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possible role of skyrmions for the superconductivity of @xmath11 based pnictides and chalogenides has been discussed in @xcite . in this paper , for the first time , we investigate the localization of holes on a skyrmion using the low - energy effective theory for lightly hole - doped antiferromagnets on a square lattice . in particular , we carefully quantize the skyrmion s collective modes , which allows us to unambiguously determine the quantum numbers of single holes as well as hole pairs localized on a skyrmion .    at the classical level ,",
    "the mass of a skyrmion is given by @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath3 becomes small , these excitations hence become energetically favorable .",
    "skyrmions are beyond reach of the systematic derivative expansion of the low - energy effective theory for magnons and holes . indeed , when skyrmions become relevant low - energy degrees of freedom , antiferromagnetism as well as the effective theory that describes it are about to break down .",
    "still , the effective theory correctly describes the way in which holes couple to a skyrmion excitation in the staggered magnetization order parameter .",
    "in particular , holes may get localized on a skyrmion .",
    "when two holes get localized on the same skyrmion , they form a bound state which may represent a relevant low - energy degree of freedom even when antiferromagnetism gives way to the pseudo - gap phase . in particular , such bound states are a potential candidate for preformed pairs whose condensation may ultimately lead to high - temperature superconductivity . in order to decide whether this is a viable scenario , in this paper we investigate the symmetry properties of skyrmion - hole bound states in great detail .",
    "we find that the p - wave states of two holes localized on a skyrmion with winding number @xmath0 transform exactly like the two - hole states weakly bound by one - magnon exchange .",
    "two holes localized on a skyrmion may also have s- or d - wave symmetry . which of these states is energetically most favorable depends on the details of the dynamics , and",
    "will remain a subject for future investigations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the effective theory for the staggered magnetization order parameter",
    "is introduced and skyrmions are discussed as classical solutions . the hopf term is introduced and the collective modes of a rotating skyrmion are then quantized . in section 3 doped holes",
    "are added to the effective theory . in section 4",
    "states of single holes as well as a pair of holes ( residing in two different hole pockets ) localized on a static or rotating skyrmion are constructed and their symmetry properties are investigated .",
    "possible relations to the mechanism responsible for high - temperature superconductivity are also discussed .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "finally , the case of two holes residing in the same hole pocket is investigated in appendix a.",
    "in this section we discuss the collective mode quantization of skyrmions in the low - energy effective theory for antiferromagnetic magnons .",

    "magnons are small fluctuations around the vacuum configuration .",
    "it should be noted that , in contrast to a ferromagnet , antiferromagnetic magnons have a `` relativistic '' dispersion relation .",
    "the most important symmetry of the action is the spontaneously broken spin symmetry @xmath8 . in the following",
    ", global transformations in the unbroken subgroup @xmath9 will play an important role .",

    "consequently , its unbroken @xmath9 subgroup ( which is analogous to isospin in particle physics ) should also be viewed as an internal symmetry .",
    "because of the analogy with isospin , we denote transformations in the unbroken subgroup @xmath9 by @xmath22 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath8 spin symmetry , the effective action has other symmetries as well .",
    "first of all , due to the relativistic dispersion relation of antiferromagnetic magnons , the leading terms in the effective action have an emergent accidental poincar symmetry which is not present in the underlying hubbard or @xmath1-@xmath2 model , and which will thus be explicitly broken by higher - order terms in the effective action containing a larger number of derivatives .",
    "the remaining symmetries are the discrete translations and rotations of the underlying quadratic lattice .",
    "similar to the spin symmetry , the displacements @xmath23 by one lattice spacing in the @xmath24-direction are also spontaneously broken in an antiferromagnet .",
    "they act on the staggered magnetization field as @xmath25 since the shift symmetries @xmath23 are spontaneously broken in an antiferromagnet , it is convenient to also introduce modified shift symmetries @xmath26 which combine @xmath23 with an @xmath8 spin rotation @xmath27 such that @xmath28 spatial translations by an even number of lattice spacings , on the other hand , remain unbroken .",
    "such translations @xmath29 by a distance vector @xmath30 act as @xmath31 similarly , parametrizing @xmath32 , spatial rotations by an angle @xmath33 act as @xmath34 and a spatial reflection at the @xmath35-axis is represented by @xmath36 finally , time reversal , which changes the direction of a spin , acts as @xmath37 the effective action of eq.([effact ] ) is invariant under all these symmetries",

    "the identification of skyrmions as baryons can even be established within the framework of chiral perturbation theory , by investigating the electromagnetic interactions of pions which are affected by a goldstone - wilczek current @xcite .",
    "since the underlying qcd theory has a conserved baryon number current , the conservation of the topological skyrme current is guaranteed beyond the semi - classical regime .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the winding number @xmath44 \\in \\pi_2[s^2]$ ] of the skyrmions in an antiferromagnet can also be identified with a conserved quantity of an underlying microscopic system , such as the hubbard model . in particular , in analogy to particle physics",
    ", one might suspect that the winding number can be identified with the fermion number of doped holes .",
    "however , this is not the case because the winding number and the fermion number have different symmetry properties . in particular , the winding number changes sign under a shift @xmath23 by one lattice spacing , while the fermion number does not .",

    "the conservation of the topological current also plays a central role in the scenario of deconfined quantum criticality @xcite in which dynamically generated gauge fields and deconfined spinons are conjectured to appear at a new type of quantum phase transition outside the realm of the standard ginsburg - landau - wilson paradigm .",

    "as discussed in appendix a , two holes of the same flavor can also get localized on a skyrmion",
    ". it will be the subject of a subsequent publication to decide which of the various states is energetically most favorable .",
    "while in this paper we have concentrated on a detailed symmetry analysis , we also want to get at least a crude estimate of the binding energy of two - hole states localized on an @xmath0 skyrmion . ignoring contact interactions between the two holes , the total energy of the bound state of two holes and a skyrmion",
    "can then be estimated as @xmath312 while two free holes ( not localized on a skyrmion ) just have their rest energy @xmath313 . using the result of eq.([bindinge ] )",

    "similar instabilities are related to the formation of spiral phases in the staggered magnetization order parameter . in particular , in @xcite we have shown that the ground state with a spatially constant staggered magnetization becomes unstable against the formation of a 45 degrees spiral phase for @xmath315 .",
    "since antiferromagnetism is weakened upon doping , @xmath3 is expected to eventually go to zero . before this happens ,",
    "pairs of holes will get localized on a skyrmion .    in order to get at least a rough idea of the involved energy scales ,",

    "it may involve some wishful thinking to assume that the d - wave state of two holes localized on an @xmath0 or 2 skyrmion will not only turn out to be energetically favorable , but also ready to condense at sufficiently large doping .",
    "however , we think that it is worthwhile to take this possibility seriously .",

    "we have performed a detailed study of the localization of holes on a skyrmion in an square lattice antiferromagnet . when two holes get localized on the same skyrmion , they form a bound state .",
    "interestingly , in some cases , the quantum numbers of these topologically non - trivial bound states are the same as those of the topologically trivial bound states resulting from one - magnon exchange between two holes .",
    "the ground state of two holes weakly bound by one - magnon exchange has p - wave symmetry and may evolve into a strongly bound state of two holes localized on an @xmath0 skyrmion at strong coupling .",
    "magnon - mediated two - hole bound states which are excited in the angular motion have s- or d - wave symmetry . remarkably , s- and d - wave states are degenerate due to an interplay of the various symmetries . similarly , there are strongly bound states of two holes localized on an @xmath0 or 2 skyrmion which also have s- or d - wave symmetry , and are again degenerate",
    ". which of these states is energetically most favorable will be an interesting subject for future studies .",
    "if a d - wave state turns out to be the ground state at sufficiently strong doping , two holes localized on a skyrmion are a promising candidate for a preformed cooper pair in the pseudo - gap regime .",
    "interestingly , the effective theory provides detailed predictions for the anatomy of these objects .",
    "in particular , their angular structure follows unambiguously from our symmetry analysis , and is insensitive to the details of the radial dynamics .",
    "understanding the dynamical mechanism responsible for high - temperature superconductivity has proved to be one of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics .",
