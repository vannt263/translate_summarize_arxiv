    "there now exists a highly developed and indefinitely generalisable ` inversion ' technique which makes it straightforward to carry out @xmath0-matrix to potential inversion over a very wide range of energies and for a wide range of projectile - target combinations .",
    "this is the ` iterative perturbative ' , ip , method .",
    "inversion by means of the ip method offers many possibilities for increasing our physical understanding of nuclear scattering and inter - nuclear potentials , both for stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "here we support this claim by : ( 1 ) briefly indicating the underlying principles of ip inversion ; ( 2 ) giving an overview of the range of applicability of the ip method  this amounts to specifying what we mean by ` inversion ' , an increasingly general concept ; ( 3 ) indicating with typical examples the two basic ways it can be applied , i.e.  to theoretical and empirical @xmath2 ; and , ( 4 ) presenting a case study to show how a joint study of theoretical and empirical @xmath2 brings potential models centre stage as we fit data that had never been fitted and at the same time evaluate a theoretical model for which there had been no satisfactory evaluation . in doing this , we show the power of potential models once freed of historical limitations .",
    "the case study concerns d + @xmath1he scattering .",
    "the deuteron is , of course , the archetypal weakly bound projectile and the d + @xmath1he system is one where there is some chance of a fully microscopic description , and also where there is a large amount of data .",
    "it is therefore an ideal testing ground for some of the physics relating to more exotic highly polarizable nuclei .    to date",
    ", most of the applications have not been to nuclei far from stability ; we draw attention to the exceptions .",
    "there is considerable potential for applications to exotic nuclei and there will be many applications that we are unaware of .",
    "the method is implemented in a very general code imago  @xcite which we are making portable .",
    "historically , fixed-@xmath3 inversion refers to the formal determination of the potential @xmath4 which leads via schrdinger s equation to @xmath2 for some fixed @xmath3 and all energies @xmath5 ; fixed energy inversion is the determination of @xmath4 from @xmath2 for all @xmath3 at some fixed energy .",
    "practical versions of formal methods  @xcite for fixed-@xmath3 and fixed energy inversion that can handle , for example , finite ranges of energy or of @xmath3 have disadvantages and progress toward practical means of treating spin has been slow .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 which are imprecise or defined over small @xmath3 ranges are difficult to handle , so the number of applications yielding real physical insight has been small .",
    "a less formal method , iterative perturbative ( ip ) inversion , has been developed  @xcite .",
    "ip inversion is very general and is readily extended to include spin .",
    "it can , moreover , give meaningful results with @xmath2 given over small ranges of @xmath3 and also for @xmath2 which are imprecisely determined .",
    "this last point turns out to be a crucial advantage in many situations , particularly when experimental data is fitted .",
    "the ip method has been described a number of times  @xcite , so we do no more than briefly outline the underlying concepts .",
    "the key idea is iteratively to correct a potential @xmath4 by adding terms@xmath6 where @xmath7 are members of a suitable set of ` basis functions ' and @xmath8 are amplitudes derived from linear equations arising from the response , assumed linear , of the elastic scattering @xmath0-matrix to small changes @xmath9 in the potential : @xmath10 in equation  [ integ ] , the radial wavefunction for angular momentum @xmath3 is normalised according to @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the incoming and outgoing coulomb wavefunctions .",
    "the notation is simplified : @xmath4 stands for real and imaginary , central and spin - orbit terms which can be expanded in different bases ; for the cases where spin and many energies are treated see the papers cited above .",
    "ip inversion is indefinitely generalisable .",
    "the possibilities include :    i. fixed energy inversion : :    for one energy and for finite set of @xmath3 ,    @xmath14 .",
    "the problem at low energies is    that there are too few partial waves to yield a usefully defined    potential .",
    "ii . mixed case ( energy bite ) inversion : :    the problem noted for fixed energy inversion can be solved where ( as    is often the case ) one has available the set @xmath2 over a    range of energies ( ` energy bite ' ) . for a narrow bite , this is    tantamount to including @xmath15 as input    information into the inversion .",
    "energy dependent inversion : :    often , one expects the potential , particularly the imaginary parts , to    vary over the relevant energy range . in this case , ip inversion can be    extended to determine directly an energy dependent potential . in    published cases",
    "@xcite , this is limited to the factored form    @xmath16 for each component , but this limitation will be    lifted in the future .",
    "iv . inversion to fit bound state and resonance energies : :    bound state and resonance energies can be included in the input    information for the inversion . v. direct data to potential inversion : :    this new development is discussed in section  [ direct ] .    ip inversion can be applied to spinless projectiles , @xmath14 , or spin 1/2 projectiles , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is complex if @xmath19 . inversion for spin 1 and spin 3/2 projectiles leading to vector spin - orbit potentials has been carried out and the generalisation to tensor forces is under development .    for the case of identical bosons",
    ", one can determine potentials given @xmath2 for even @xmath3 only .",
    "for many pairs of interacting nuclei , it is possible to determine wigner and majorana terms for each component , symbolically : @xmath20 .",
    "both theory and experiment make majorana components obligatory in many cases .",
    "indeed , it often emerges that inverting some given @xmath2 presents a choice between oscillatory pure wigner potentials and relatively smooth potentials which having majorana components . in some cases ,",
    "highly oscillatory @xmath3-independent potentials which are @xmath2-equivalent to explicitly parity dependent phenomenological potentials have been determined .",
    "theory and experiment both provide @xmath2 , and it is often fruitful to compare @xmath4 inverted from both sources for the same scattering situation .",
    "examples are p + @xmath1he , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and d + @xmath1he , described in section  [ rgmtheory ] .",
    "one key point is that the best basic theory ( typically rgm ) can not closely fit the data .",
    "but many qualitative features can be extracted by inversion of rgm @xmath2 , see section  [ pfrommt ] .",
    "these can be compared with the same features extracted from experimental data by the use of inversion techniques , often the _ only _ way of extracting these properties .",
    "a local representation of the dynamic polarization potential , dpp , arising from the coupling to specific channels , follows immediately by inverting the elastic @xmath2 given by cc , crc , cdcc , adiabatic model etc .   and subtracting the bare potential .",
    "of relevance to halo nuclei is the fact that the real part of the dpp arising from the breakup of loosely bound projectiles tends to have  @xcite a characteristic pattern of repulsion in the far surface and attraction at smaller radii .",
    "the geometric properties of the real potential are thereby modified and so therefore are deductions concerning the nuclear size .      often , the most direct and efficient means of finding the local equivalent of a non - local potential is inversion .",
    "in particular , we have determined  @xcite the energy dependent local potential that represents the perey buck non - local potential and verified that its energy dependence agrees well with that derived from rgm ( see below ) and also the phenomenological energy dependence .",
    "certain theories of nuclear reactions do not naturally yield a local potential model , yet potentials still provide an essential link to phenomenology . for _ ab initio _ calculations of scattering involving light nuclei ,",
    "the best existing model is probably the resonating group model , rgm .",
    "agreement with experiment is qualitative as a result of the necessary use of schematic interactions and the omission of important configurations .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that rgm does yield qualitatively correct features emerges when one determines potentials from rgm @xmath21 .",
    "recent rgm studies include : ref .",
    "@xcite which assesses the majorana terms for helion and alpha scattering from nuclei as heavy as @xmath22o ; ref .",
    "@xcite which determines the majorana term for the nucleon - nucleus potential for nuclei as heavy as @xmath23ca .",
    "both papers analyse the contribution of specific exchange or coupling terms in the rgm kernel to the strength and energy dependence of specific wigner or majorana terms in the inter - nucleus potential .",
    "the agreement between rgm and experiment for p + @xmath1he  @xcite is mentioned in section  [ twostep ] .        as an alternative to standard model - independent optical - model phenomenology",
    ", one can fit the elastic scattering differential cross - section with an @xmath0-matrix function @xmath24 and then invert .",
    "the second step is by far the more straightforward .",
    "concerning the first step , the good news is that phenomenology is liberated from prejudices concerning the form of the potential ; the bad news is the immense range of ambiguities which emerges .",
    "what was originally impossible to fit precisely becomes all too easy to fit .",
    "in fact , the realization of just how profound the ambiguities are , even at the level of essentially perfect fits , is a clear lesson which emerges .",
    "one must therefore judiciously reinstate some prejudices , such as continuity with energy , and , most usefully , a relationship between the behaviour of @xmath25 ( and to a lesser extent @xmath26 ) and the same quantities derived from the static approximation glauber model .",
    "this has been done for @xmath22o + @xmath22o  @xcite , @xmath27c + @xmath27c  @xcite , and @xmath28li scattering from @xmath27c and @xmath29si  @xcite . referring to the figures in ref .",
    "@xcite , one sees that it is indeed all too easy to get essentially perfect fits to the data , radical ambiguities existing even at the @xmath2 level .",
    "we argue in ref .",
    "@xcite that our least unreasonable fit to @xmath28li elastic scattering data corresponds to a potential with a long tail in the real potential .",
    "this feature can not be explained on the basis of current theories of @xmath28li .",
    "similar potentials for @xmath28li + @xmath27c were found by mermaz  @xcite by quite different means .",
    "there was no evidence for such a tail in the non - halo @xmath28c + @xmath27c case .",
    "it is widely believed that these fits reflect faulty data and that new data will be fitted by a potential more in line with current theory .",
    "we keenly await the arrival of such new data , preferably for as wide as possible an angular range , and for as many energies as possible .",
    "the full information content of such data can be exploited . since the @xmath28li work  @xcite",
    ", we have learned new ways to incorporate information from many energies , see section  [ direct ] .",
    "the ambiguity problem is much reduced when data at a series of energies is fitted with a functional form @xmath30 to which one applies ` mixed case ' or energy dependent inversion .",
    "such forms of @xmath30 for few nucleon systems are typically @xmath31-matrix or effective range fits .",
    "there are limits to the energy over which smooth @xmath30 exist , but one can also incorporate @xmath32 for discrete energies @xmath33 ( one can also fit just the discrete @xmath32 blurring the distinction from the previous category . ) for p + @xmath1he scattering , a majorana term , falling quite rapidly with energy , emerges , in agreement with that found by inverting rgm @xmath21 .",
    "the energy dependence of the wigner term , largely due to knock - on exchange , is consistent with nucleon - nucleus phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "recently , a generalisation of the ip method for direct observable to potential inversion has been developed  @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that the linear equations by which amplitudes @xmath8 are determined at each iteration arise from the minimisation of the goodness of fit quantity @xmath34 : @xmath35 \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_k}{\\partial s_l(e_k)}\\frac{\\partial s_l(e_k ) } { \\partial c_i } + 2\\sum_{n , k , l}\\left[\\frac{p_{kn}-p_{kn}^{\\rm in}}{(\\delta p_{kn}^{\\rm in})^2 } \\right ] \\frac{\\partial p_{kn}}{\\partial s_l(e_k)}\\frac{\\partial s_l(e_k ) } { \\partial c_i } \\label{new}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the input experimental values of cross sections and analyzing powers respectively ( @xmath38 indexing the spin related observables for spin 1 systems ) , and @xmath39 since we are fitting data for many energies at once , the index @xmath40 indicates the energy as well as angle .",
    "the power of this approach will be evident from the d + @xmath1he case study described below , but we note that it has yielded the best phenomenological description of p + @xmath22o scattering to date  @xcite .",
    "here we bring together rgm theory , the adiabatic model of breakup and a large compilation  @xcite of experimental data to present an emerging picture of d + @xmath1he scattering .",
    "this is work in progress with many issues to be settled .",
    "the rgm @xmath21 are from the multi - configuration rgm ( mcrgm ) study by kanada _",
    "@xcite , hereafter kkst , of elastic scattering of deuterons by @xmath1he .",
    "up to 8 pseudo - states in the deuteron wavefunction were coupled to the elastic scattering to represent s - wave breakup . a phenomenological imaginary potential was included in order to represent the effects of omitted open channels .",
    "the n - n interaction was somewhat schematic in line with the demands of rgm calculations of this complexity .",
    "in particular , there was a spin - orbit but no tensor nn force .",
    "both the @xmath1he nucleus and the deuteron were pure s - wave and there was no breakup into deuteron d - states . in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed the inversion of the kkst @xmath21 for deuteron laboratory energies of 29.4 and 56 mev and presented complex potentials with spin - orbit components , plus majorana terms for each component .",
    "it follows from figures 1 and 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite that the real , wigner , central part of the potentials varied in a reasonable way with energy . at 29.4 mev ,",
    "the volume integral per nucleon pair was @xmath41 mev @xmath42 and the rms radius was 2.905 fm ( c.f .",
    "section  [ fitting ] ) .",
    "the real wigner spin - orbit potential was unusual in form , having a deep minimum at the nuclear centre , but was reasonable in magnitude .",
    "it is relevant for what follows below that this shape seemed to be well determined and was almost identical for both energies and very similar to the corresponding term determined from @xmath21 for the no - breakup rgm calculations of lemere _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "we note two provisos concerning the spin - orbit form : the spin - orbit potential is not determined for @xmath43 the turning point for p - waves , @xmath44 fm , so the inner cusp is just a smooth continuation of the potential further out .",
    "secondly , tensor forces are omitted ; while there are no off - diagonal matrix elements generated by the rgm calculations , the vector potential might well be mocking up effects which are of tensor nature  @xcite .",
    "unlike the real spin - orbit terms , other components were different at the two energies , probably because of the marked increase with energy of flux into reaction channels .",
    "the mcrgm of kkst gave qualitative fits to experiment .",
    "the question then arises : how well do these calculations describe d + @xmath1he elastic scattering ? it could be claimed that the fits are what one might expect of any potential with correct overall strength and radius and a freely fitted additional imaginary term .",
    "we give an account below of the extent to which kkst mcrgm calculations do lead to a potential model consistent with good description of d + @xmath1he elastic scattering .",
    "how important is the omission of d - wave breakup in the rgm calculations ? to estimate this , we performed adiabatic model breakup calculations@xcite using the code adia  @xcite .",
    "inversion of @xmath2 ( spin was ignored ) led to the conclusion that as far as the real potential was concerned , the contribution of s - wave breakup is largely confined to the central region , @xmath45 fm , where it generates a considerable extra attraction , a feature also found in rgm by kukulin _",
    "et al _  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "d - wave breakup induces extra attraction over a wide radial range , but repulsion in the surface region .",
    "the effect is therefore to reduce the rms radius of the real potential .",
    "the effect on the imaginary central potential of adding d - wave breakup is similar to the effect on the real part . instead of being confined to the centre of the nucleus , as it is for s - wave breakup ,",
    "we find added absorption at all radii within the nucleus . however , according to the adiabatic model , one characteristic effect of adding deuteron breakup is the generation of a very deep absorptive region near the nuclear centre .",
    "such a deep feature is not found in the mcrgm results , section  [ rgm ] , nor , at lower energies at least , empirically , section  [ fitting ] .",
    "it remains to be studied whether it is the adiabatic assumption or the neglect of exchange which is responsible for the difference .",
    "not only does mcrgm predict a less absorptive region near @xmath46 , but sometimes local emissivity , a phenomenon associated with strong non - local effects which are often very different from the perey effect .",
    "we conclude that d - state breakup is not ignorable in d + @xmath1he scattering .",
    "the contributions to the local d + @xmath1he potential induced by breakup are generally consistent with generic effects  @xcite for heavy target nuclei .",
    "the fact that s - wave breakup induces attraction plus absorption only at the nuclear centre while d - wave breakup induces a polarization potential for all @xmath47 is due in general terms to the fact that the intermediate state partial wave @xmath3 can change by @xmath48 in the latter case , but a more detailed explanation would be welcome .",
    "there is much experimental data for d + @xmath1he elastic scattering .",
    "it has been carefully assembled and evaluated by kuznetsova and kukulin  @xcite who also present a phase shift analysis , psa .",
    "the serious problems arising with such analyses motivate work in preparation , see ref .",
    "@xcite , in which this data is fitted in the course of demonstrating how inversion leads to a solution of the phase shift analysis problem . here",
    ", our concern is to exploit potential models to confront experiment with rgm . of the many available data sets we have fitted two :",
    "one ( set ` j ' ) comprises the angular distributions and vector analysing powers of jenny _ et al _",
    "@xcite at 5 deuteron laboratory energies between 6.24 mev and 10 mev .",
    "the second ( set ` sg ' ) combines the differential cross sections at 19 energies between 2.935 and 11.475 mev  @xcite and vector analysing powers at 12 energies between 3.0 and 11.5 mev  @xcite , 539 data in all . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the differential cross sections and analysing powers of one of the two ( j or sg ) data sets for all energies are fitted to a single potential ( which we designate respectively as the j or sg potential ) using the direct data - to - potential form of ip inversion described in section  [ direct ] .",
    "we have not exploited the possibility  @xcite of determining a fully energy dependent potential , the real components all being energy independent .",
    "however , the imaginary components are energy dependent . when fitting the sg data , all imaginary components are assumed to be zero below @xmath50 , @xmath50 being the inelastic threshold energy . for both j and sg data , all imaginary components are proportional to @xmath51 above @xmath50 .",
    "tensor observables are not fitted and we include no representation of tensor forces , these being understood to have a small effect on vector analysing power .",
    "the starting potential for the ip procedure was that described in section  [ rgm ] as fitting the 29.4 mev kkst @xmath21 .",
    "although it is possible to include the s - wave bound state energy of @xmath52 mev in the inversion input data , mostly we did not do this .",
    "instead , the bound state energy was monitored to verify the consistency of the inversion .",
    "the possible dependence of the results on the starting potential must be borne in mind in the following discussion .",
    "remarkably , the inversion process converged very rapidly to a potential that was rather close to the starting potential , in spite of the merely qualitative initial fit .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the fit , for representative energies , to the sg data with the sg potential ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 mev . the j potential",
    "fitted the j data equally well , @xmath55 and @xmath56 mev .",
    "we comment below on the values of @xmath57 . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath58 are calculated using uncertainties which do not represent all the errors discussed in the source references . in figures 3 ( wigner terms ) and 4 ( majorana terms )",
    "we compare the starting potential , i.e. the inversion potential for kkst mcrgm at 29.4 mev , with the j and sg potentials .",
    "the ( energy dependent ) imaginary terms are evaluated at 8 mev .",
    "the j and sg potentials are very similar and we compare them jointly with the rgm starting point . for the sg potential ,",
    "the real , w , central potential had volume integral per nucleon pair @xmath59 mev @xmath42 and rms radius 3.01 fm ; these values for potential j were 556.5 mev @xmath42 and 2.86 fm . if the energy dependence of ref .",
    "@xcite applies to @xmath60 and to scattering from @xmath1he , the value at 30 mev lab energy would be roughly 535 mev @xmath42 , rather more than the rgm value of 499.72 mev @xmath42 , ( c.f .",
    "section  [ rgm ] ) .",
    "the volume integral of the mcrgm real central w potential is thus a little less than the j and sg data , together with general deuteron scattering phenomenology , suggest . while it is true that d - state breakup would appreciably increase the depth over much of the radial range , the adiabatic model for 40 mev suggests little modification to @xmath60 due to the influence of repulsion in the far surface on the @xmath61 weighted integral for @xmath60",
    ". nevertheless , overall the rgm and empirical potentials are similar in shape .",
    "the most striking difference lies in the w , central , imaginary part ; this is reasonable since the flux into inelastic channels must increase markedly between 8 and 29.4 mev .",
    "the emissive region at the nuclear centre for this imaginary term is firmly established by inversion .",
    "this is not unusual in rgm inversion studies and there is a nearly emissive feature at the centre of the mcrgm potential , probably due to non - locality .",
    "there is nothing comparable in the unsymmetrised adiabatic breakup calculations .",
    "the w spin - orbit terms broadly follow the rgm shape .",
    "we have pointed out that the spin - orbit potential is not determined for @xmath62 fm and the central cusps are probably an artifact of the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "one curious feature is that fact that potential j has @xmath60 which is slightly smaller in magnitude than that of potential sg .",
    "this is , of course , consistent with the higher mean energy of the data to which it is fitted , but the associated deeper binding for potential j is somewhat counter - intuitive .",
    "from another perspective it is not , perhaps , surprising that the potential ( sg ) which is constrained by data reaching to lower energies gives a better fit to the experimental binding energy , @xmath52 mev .",
    "however , the calculation of @xmath60 and , even more the rms radius , demands that the potential be very well determined in the far surface ; we can not absolutely guarantee this at present .",
    "concerning the much smaller m terms in figure 4 : unsurprisingly , the j and sg potentials jointly differ more from the 29.4 mev starting potential , and are probably poorly determined for @xmath63 fm . the attractive real central term for @xmath64 fm , where j and sg agree with rgm , seems to be well established .",
    "these studies are continuing ; the energy range will be increased , and the possibility that some irregular features in the potential are artefacts of an inadequate energy dependence and/or lack of tensor interaction studied .",
    "observable - to - potential ip inversion will find a local potential to fit any elastic scattering data .",
    "if data for several energies are available , so much the better , since continuity with energy is a useful criterion in evaluating ambiguities when what was otherwise impossible to fit precisely becomes all too easy to fit . in some cases , other _",
    "a priori _ information can be incorporated .",
    "ip inversion can contribute to a theoretical understanding of potentials .",
    "it readily yields local potentials corresponding to any theoretical model whatever ; thus one can relate modifications to the model to changes induced in the potential .",
    "this opens the way to finding a rich variety of generic properties of the dpp or exchange contributions ( especially for rgm ) , pointing to what is required to make good the difference between theoretical and empirical potentials .",
    "inversion for both experiment and theory for the same reaction makes local potentials of special value .",
    "the p + @xmath65he case discussed elsewhere , and the d + @xmath1he case discussed here show this .",
    "we have concluded that the kkst model gives a very good description of d + @xmath1he scattering even though the fits presented by kkst seem mediocre .",
    "for example , theory and data substantially agree the on the nature of the real majorana terms ; the imaginary majorana terms probably require d - state breakup which we know is required in a complete description .",
    "a host of interesting theoretical puzzles arise from this work : for example , just how do non - locality effects lead to an emissive region at the nuclear centre rather than the deep absorptive region firmly predicated by unsymmetrised breakup calculations ?    we are grateful to the epsrc for grant gr / h00895 supporting dr cooper .",
    "we are particularly indebted to professor v.i .",
    "kukulin of moscow for providing numerical data and much inspiration .",
