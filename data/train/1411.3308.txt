    "in this paper we study the distribution of finite type invariants of random knots and links . our purpose is to investigate properties of _ typical _ knots , avoiding biases caused by focusing attention on a limited set of commonly studied examples .",
    "while tables of knots with up to 16 crossings have been compiled @xcite , and much is understood about infinite classes of knots , such as torus and alternating knots , we suspect that our view of the collection of all knots is distorted by the choices that simplicity and availability have given us .",
    "we have little knowledge of the distribution of knot invariants such as the jones polynomial , or the linking number , among highly complicated knots and links .",
    "studying a model of _ random knots _ allows us to probe for typical behavior beyond the familiar classes .",
    "as we elaborate below , the spectacular success of the probabilistic method in combinatorics makes us hopeful that it has much to offer in topology as well .",
    "a variety of models for random knots and links have been studied by physicists and biologists , as well as mathematicians .",
    "common models are based on random 4-valent planar graphs with randomly assigned crossings , random diagrams on the integer grid in @xmath3 , gaussian random polygons  @xcite , and random walks on lattices in @xmath0 @xcite . while many interesting numerical studies have been performed , and interesting results obtained in these models , there have been few rigorous derivations of associated statistical measures .    in this paper",
    "we study a model of random knots and links called the _",
    "petaluma model _ , based on the representation of knots and links as petal diagrams that was introduced by adams and studied in @xcite .",
    "the petaluma model has the advantage of being both universal , in that it represents all knots and links , and combinatorially simple , so that knots have simple descriptions in terms of a single permutation .",
    "we obtain here what appears to be the first precise formulas in any random model for the distributions of knot and link invariants .",
    "we first derive a formula for the limiting distribution of the linking number of a random two component link .",
    "this is shown to have an unexpected connection to a distribution previously studied by physicists in another context .",
    "as it turns out , the distribution of the linking number is identical to that of the signed area enclosed by a random path on the integer lattice in the plane .",
    "this has a physical interpretation as the flux of a vector field through a random planar curve .",
    "we develop a variation of the approach of mingo and nica to a closely related problem on signed area  @xcite , in order to analyze this model and to obtain the linking number distribution .",
    "we then study the distributions of the two simplest knot invariants of finite type , namely the order-2 casson invariant @xmath4 and the order-3 invariant @xmath1 , associated to the jones polynomial .",
    "we are able to find expressions for the expectation , variance and higher moments of these two invariants .",
    "we present these results after describing our model for random knots and links and reviewing the construction of finite - type invariants .",
    "a _ knot _ is a simple closed curve in @xmath0 , up to equivalence generated by an isotopy of @xmath0  @xcite , while a _ link _ is a disjoint union of simple closed curves , with the same equivalence .",
    "the curves can be taken to be either smooth or piecewise - linear ( polygonal ) .",
    "knots and links are commonly represented by _ diagrams _ , which are projections of a knot or link to the plane in which a finite number of points have two preimages , and each such _ crossing point _ is marked to indicate which point lies above the other in @xmath0 .",
    "a diagram suffices to recover a knot or link up to an isotopy of @xmath0 .",
    "adams et al",
    ".  showed that an embedding of a knot or link in @xmath0 can be chosen so that its projection has a single crossing , though the multiplicity with which the knot projects to this crossing is now allowed to be larger than two @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of knots , the projected arcs can be arranged so that they trace out a rose - like curve .",
    "a _ petal diagram _ is a planar curve , comprised of @xmath5 straight segments crossing at a single point , and arcs connecting consecutive pairs of segment tips .",
    "this creates @xmath5 loops with disjoint interiors , called _",
    "petals_. figure  [ fig_petal1 ] shows a petal diagram with @xmath6 petals .",
    "along with its projection , a petal diagram comes with information on how to construct a knot in @xmath0 that projects to the diagram .",
    "the additional information specifies the height of the arcs passing above the single crossing .",
    "the ordering of these heights is specified by a permutation @xmath7 , with @xmath8 giving the knot s height as it passes over the center for the @xmath9th time .",
    "this representation is _ universal _ , so that all knots are realized by some petal diagram ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .",
    "each permutation determines a knot , and in the _ petaluma model _ we define a random knot @xmath10 to be a knot with a @xmath5 petal diagram and permutation @xmath11 , drawn uniformly at random .",
    "this construction extends to links . a _ two - component petal diagram _ consists of two planar curves , each of which transversely passes @xmath12 times through a single point , as shown in figure  [ fig_petal2 ] for @xmath13 .",
    "note that this diagram is not composed of two standard petal diagrams , as its restriction to each component is a _ pre - petal diagram _",
    "@xcite , with one big loop whose interior contains the other loops . however , the transition between pre - petal and petal diagrams is immediate , and this diagram is the closest to a petal diagram that one can get for links having more than one component .    as with a knot , a two - component link",
    "is uniquely determined by a permutation @xmath14 .",
    "the strands of the first component pass above the crossing at heights @xmath15 and the strands of the second at heights @xmath16 .",
    "this gives a universal model for two - component links  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) , and the petaluma model for a random two - component link @xmath17 , is obtained by drawing @xmath18 uniformly at random from @xmath19 .",
    "this model can be adjusted to allow for unequal numbers of petals in the two components , or a higher number of components .    in one of its key properties ,",
    "the petaluma model differs from other models of random knots such as closed random walks in @xmath0 .",
    "the typical step length in the petaluma model is of the same order as the diameter of the whole knot .",
    "models which take substantially shorter steps tend to create small local entanglement which significantly affect the nature of the generated knots .",
    "a _ knot invariant _ associates to a curve a quantity , such as a real number , a polynomial , or a group , that depends only on the knot type of the curve .",
    "many invariants have been introduced to help in understanding the structure of knots , including the knot group , knot polynomials , the knot genus , the bridge number and the crossing number .",
    "link invariants are similarly defined .",
    "an important class of knot and link invariants , called _ finite type invariants _ , were introduced by vassiliev  @xcite , and have since been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "many knot invariants are finite type , including the coefficients of the conway and of the modified jones polynomials .",
    "the first two non - trivial finite type knot invariants , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are determined by coefficients of these polynomials .",
    "two - component links admit a non - trivial order-1 invariant , the linking number @xmath22 .",
    "a description of finite type invariants appears at the start of section  [ linksect ] .",
    "we study the behavior of finite type invariants of knots and links in the petaluma model .",
    "we view a knot invariant as a random variable on the set of all diagrams with @xmath5 petals , and ask for its distribution and for its asymptotic growth as @xmath23 .",
    "recall that the @xmath24th _ moment _ of a random variable @xmath25 is the expected value @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the moments of an invariant give a concrete indication of its value on a randomly sampled knot or link .",
    "to understand the distribution of an invariant as @xmath27 we must determine how to normalize it as @xmath28 grows .",
    "the following theorems determine the order of growth of the finite type invariants @xmath29 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 .",
    "[ moments1 ] @xmath30 $ ] is a polynomial in @xmath28 of degree @xmath31 .",

    "there is equality for @xmath24 even , while the odd moments are @xmath36 .",
    "we also determine the leading term of the @xmath37 $ ] polynomial .",
    "this yields the limits of the moments of the normalized invariant @xmath38 . for @xmath39",
    "we find @xmath40 \\xrightarrow{n \\to \\infty } 1/24 $ ] , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "similarly we obtain the limiting variance @xmath43 \\xrightarrow{n \\to \\infty } 4649/2721600 $ ] .    in the case of the linking number of two - component links ,",
    "we can do more .",
    "we exactly describe the limiting distribution of the properly normalized first order invariant @xmath44 as  @xmath45 .    [ linking ] the limiting probability distribution of the normalized linking number @xmath46",
    "is given by @xmath47 \\;\\xrightarrow{\\;n\\rightarrow\\infty\\;}\\ ; \\int^{\\beta}_{\\alpha } \\frac{\\pi}{\\cosh^2(2 \\pi x)}dx \\;=\\ ; \\frac{\\tanh(2 \\pi \\beta ) - \\tanh(2 \\pi \\alpha)}{2 } \\;\\;.\\ ] ]    theorem  [ linking ] resolves a difficulty that was encountered in the uniform random polygon model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it gives the first explicit description of the asymptotic probability distribution for any knot or link invariant .",
    "our proof of theorems  [ moments1 ] and  [ linking ] is an adaptation and simplification of mingo and nica s study of the area enclosed by a random curve  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ moments2 ] shows that @xmath48 typically grows as @xmath49 , while theorem  [ moments3 ] show that @xmath50 grows as @xmath51 . in combination with theorem  [ linking ] , these results naturally suggest the following conjecture :    [ limitdist ] let @xmath52 be a knot invariant of order @xmath53",
    ". then @xmath54 weakly converges to a limit distribution as @xmath55 .    in section  [ cassonsect ]",
    "we discuss computational evidence for the existence of a limit distribution for @xmath38 .",
    "it is illustrative to note the _ extremely atypical _ behavior of the above - mentioned torus knots . whereas @xmath4 is typically quadratic , it is of order @xmath56 for @xmath57 torus knots .    by considering the _ blackboard framing _ of petal diagrams",
    "we obtain a universal model of  _ framed knots _",
    "this allows us to analyze finite type invariants of random framed knots , e.g. , the _ writhe _  @xcite .",
    "this analysis can be carried out using methods similar to those employed for knots .",
    "we will not discuss the framed case in this paper .",
    "the analysis of knot invariants in this paper is part of a project to apply the probabilistic method in topology .",
    "this methodology begins by defining a probability distribution on the objects of study .",
    "parameters and invariants of interest then become random variables on this probability space .",
    "tools of probability theory are then applied to investigate the distribution of these random variables .",
    "this general approach has yielded unexpected results in graph theory and many other areas .",
    "it has often provided existence proofs of objects with unexpected properties , such as expander graphs , or graphs of arbitrarily high girth and chromatic number . in many cases , such as for lower bounds for ramsey numbers , finding matching explicit constructions",
    "remains open .    in view of the great success of this paradigm in discrete mathematics ,",
    "it is natural to consider its application to the study of random geometric objects . in this direction ,",
    "the probabilistic method has played a major role in the theory of normed spaces for some time  @xcite .",
    "more recently there have been interesting attempts to study random simplicial complexes  @xcite , random 3-manifolds  @xcite and more .",
    "our focus here is to bring this approach to random knots and links , and to associated knot and link invariants .",
    "the random knots and links investigated in this paper are based on the petaluma model , which determines a knot or link from a petal diagram and a permutation .",
    "it is important to consider to what extent our results are model dependent , and to investigate what might happen if we switch to a different model .    to test the extent of model dependency of our statistics , we ran numerical studies on the distribution of the @xmath4 and @xmath1 invariants in a second random model , the grid model , discussed in section  [ cassonsect ] .",
    "our numerical experiments yield a distribution for @xmath4 in the grid model .",
    "this distribution shares many features with the distribution obtained for the petaluma model .",
    "we also derive some statistical measures in the star model , a related model introduced in section  [ cassonsect ] .",
    "the similarities between these three models are discussed in section  [ cassonsect ] .",
    "we note for example that in both the petaluma and grid models the casson invariant of a random knot appears to be positive more often than negative , at roughly a @xmath58 ratio .",
    "it remains unclear how the choice of a random model determines the statistics of a knot and link invariant , and whether universality principles apply across a wide range of models .      in sections",
    "[ linksect ] ,  [ cassonsect ] , and  [ j3sect ] , we investigate invariants of order @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively , in the random model : the linking number in section  [ linksect ] , the casson invariant @xmath4 in section  [ cassonsect ] , and @xmath1 in section  [ j3sect ] . at the end of section  [ cassonsect ] , we present some calculations of @xmath4 moments and numerical results , and discuss their relations to other models .",
    "before describing the linking number , we provide some general background on finite type invariants , an important family of knot and link invariants that includes the linking number .",
    "finite type invariants were introduced by vassiliev  @xcite and have been the subject of intensive study .",
    "these invariants are convenient to define via their extension to the more general context of singular knots and links , as we describe below .",
    "a _ singular knot _ is a smooth map of the circle @xmath62 to @xmath0 with finitely many _",
    "double _ points of transversal self intersection .",
    "this is considered up to isotopy that preserves the double points . the more general definition of a _ singular link _ is similar .",
    "a double point @xmath63 on a singular link @xmath64 can be _ resolved _ in two different ways , by locally pushing one of the strands in one direction or in the other .",
    "locally , these resolutions come in two distinct well - defined forms : positive  , and negative  . for such a double point @xmath63 , we denote the resulting links by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , each having one less singularity than  @xmath64 .    every link invariant is extended to singular links via the recursion @xmath67 .",
    "the value of @xmath68 on a singular link with @xmath69 double points is thus a signed sum of its value on @xmath70 non - singular links .",
    "a knot ( or link ) invariant is of _ finite type _ , or _ finite order _",
    "@xmath69 , if it vanishes on all singular knots ( or links ) with @xmath71 double points .",
    "the first non - trivial finite type knot invariant is the casson invariant @xmath20 , the second coefficient of the conway polynomial  @xcite .",
    "it is an invariant of order  2 .",
    "see section  [ cassonsect ] for a constructive definition .",
    "the next independent invariant , of order  3 , is determined by the third coefficient of the modified jones polynomial , to be discussed in section  [ j3sect ] . in order  4",
    "there are already three new invariants .",
    "vassiliev s conjecture states that finite type invariants distinguish knots . for more details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "a well - known invariant of two - component oriented links , the linking number @xmath22 , is an invariant of order  @xmath59 .",
    "the linking number counts the number of times that one component winds around the other , a number that is symmetric in the two components .",
    "it is defined here via link diagrams .",
    "recall that a _ link diagram _ is a projection of the link to a plane , that is one - to - one except for a finite number of double - points where two strands cross each other transversely . at each such _ crossing point _",
    "it records which strand is upper and which is lower in the original link .",
    "a crossing is _ positive _ or _ negative _ according to the orientation of the upper and lower strands as an ordered basis of the plane .",
    "the linking number of a two - component link @xmath64 can be computed from its link diagram as follows .",
    "pick arbitrarily one of the components , and consider the crossings where it passes over the other one .",

    "the @xmath75 strands pass at the center at @xmath75 different heights , where strand @xmath9 passes above strand @xmath76 if @xmath77 .",
    "the strands are numbered according to the following rule .",
    "choose two base points on the large external loop of each component , say , at the two uppermost points of the diagram .",
    "start travelling from the upper right base point along the entire component , then take a similar trip throughout the other component .",

    "the heights occurring in the two components are thus given by @xmath78    note that the two components go alternatingly back and forth along two orthogonal axes .",
    "we thus define a function that records the direction @xmath79 of the strand at each height @xmath80 , @xmath81 for example , if the strand at height @xmath82 is directed sw to ne @xmath83 , then @xmath84 .",
    "likewise , @xmath85 for a strand at height @xmath86 with direction se to nw @xmath87 . in our model , @xmath74 , @xmath79 , @xmath25 , and @xmath88",

    "a slight perturbation of @xmath74 near the center yields a link diagram with @xmath89 simple crossings , of which @xmath90 involve both components . if @xmath91 for strands @xmath92 , the sign of the corresponding crossing is @xmath93 .",
    "we thus obtain the following formula for the linking number @xmath94 this expression involves only the variables @xmath79 , @xmath25 , and @xmath88 with no direct reference to @xmath18 .",

    "the linking number as given by this formula depends only on the partition of @xmath96 = \\{1,\\dots,4n\\}$ ] into the four parts of size @xmath28 each , @xmath97 the @xmath98 possible choices of @xmath18 split into @xmath99 equal - sized subclasses , where the permutations in the same class yield the same linking number .",
    "the sum in   has an interesting interpretation .",
    "we associate with the link @xmath74 a random walk @xmath100 on the grid .",
    "the walk starts at the origin @xmath101 , and makes @xmath75 steps related to the @xmath75 strands at the center of @xmath74 s two - component petal diagram .",

    "@xmath102 this walk is _",
    "balanced_. it takes @xmath28 steps in each of the four directions , and returns to the origin at @xmath103 .",
    "note that @xmath74 induces a uniform probability distribution on the @xmath99 different walks .",
    "connecting every two consecutive lattice points that @xmath104 visits determines a polygonal path in the  @xmath105-plane .    the _ algebraic area _",
    "@xmath106 enclosed by a closed grid walk , is the sum of @xmath104 s winding numbers around all grid squares .",
    "for example , if @xmath104 is self - avoiding and oriented counterclockwise , it coincides with the regular notion of area enclosed by a curve . in general",
    ", it can be computed by a `` discrete green s theorem '' .",

    "this yields @xmath110 the distribution of the algebraic area is clearly symmetric around @xmath36 , as seen by reflecting @xmath104 around the @xmath80-axis .",
    "thus the minus sign can be ignored and the equality of distributions @xmath111 and @xmath112 follows for every @xmath28 .    an imbalanced case of this problem appears in the literature .",
    "let @xmath113 be a uniformly chosen closed @xmath114-step random walk in @xmath115 with @xmath116 steps to the left , right , up and down , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath117 is even , since @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "in the imbalanced case we do not demand that all four are equal .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of @xmath120 is known to be @xmath121 \\;\\xrightarrow{\\;n\\rightarrow\\infty\\;}\\ ; \\int^{\\beta}_{\\alpha } \\frac{\\pi}{\\cosh^2(2 \\pi x)}dx \\;=\\ ; \\frac{\\tanh(2 \\pi \\beta ) - \\tanh(2 \\pi \\alpha)}{2}\\ ] ]    this beautiful formula was established by three different approaches : by comparison to brownian motion in the plane  @xcite , through the harper equation  @xcite , and via the method of moments  @xcite",

    "some of our new ideas will be used later on when we investigate higher - order invariants .",
    "an interesting consequence of theorem  [ linking ] is that a random link is almost surely non - trivial , since the probability that the linking number vanishes tends to zero .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations ( figure  [ fig : l256 ] ) suggest even a _ local _ limit distribution law for @xmath111 .",
    "we note also that theorem  [ linking ] can be extended to the case of imbalanced random links , with @xmath128 and @xmath129 loops in the two - component petal diagram . replacing @xmath28 by @xmath130 ,",
