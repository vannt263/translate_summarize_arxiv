    "in recent years , two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in the quantum hall ( qh ) regime have attracted considerable interest in connection with the possibility of developing highly sensitive terahertz ( thz ) detectors based on the photo - induced change in conductivity@xcite . unlike conventional absorption experiments , this technique combines magneto transport with spectroscopy and provides us with a unique tool to investigate not only the bulk cyclotron resonance ( cr ) of the 2deg .",
    "it is now possible to resolve even spectral features , which are related to effects of the edge states in the qh effect@xcite , as well as excitations of collective magneto plasmon modes@xcite and spin - flip transitions@xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper , we use spectrally resolved photoconductivity measurements on a 2deg formed in a gaas / algaas heterostructure to investigate the thz excitation process in the qh regime .",
    "we use a sample structure , which is topologically equivalent to a corbino geometry , however , the circumference is greatly enlarged by a meander - like patterning .",
    "this sample structure provides us with a high sensitive of @xmath0  v / w for thz radiation@xcite and allows us to investigate not only one dominant resonance  which we identify as the bulk cyclotron resonance ( cr )  but reveals also a second , very weak resonance , situated on the high - energy side of the cr peak .",
    "we will present measurements on the magnetic field dispersion and the carrier density dependence of this high - energy resonance .",
    "additionally , we will present measurements in tilted magnetic fields , which exclude spin effects as the origin of the high - energy resonance .",
    "finally , we show that the high - energy resonance observed in the present experiments can be interpreted as a unusual magneto plasmon excitation , where the characteristic length scale of the plasmon modes is given by the depletion length of the 2deg at the sample boundary .",
    "the samples are fabricated from two different molecular - beam - epitaxially grown gaas / algaas heterostructures a and b , using standard photolithography and wet chemical etching .",

    "we use a bruker ifs113v fourier - transform spectrometer ( fts ) , and the sample itself as a photo detector to obtain spectrally resolved photoresponse measurements . at fixed magnetic fields ,",
    "the broadband thz radiation of a mercury lamp was modulated by the fts and the corresponding change in the non - local voltage @xmath9 was ac coupled to a high - impedance ( @xmath10 ) voltage preamplifier .",
    "the preamplified signal was recorded as an interferogram , which was fourier transformed to obtain the photoconductivity spectrum . in the spectral range of interest ,",
    "the light source and all optical components have a very weak dependence on wavelength , so that the recorded signal will be dominated by the spectral response of the sample itself .",
    "a system of mirrors and polished stainless - steel tubes , acting as oversized waveguides , guides the thz radiation to the sample , mounted inside a @xmath11he cryostat with a superconducting magnet , to apply fields up to @xmath12  t. optionally , a commercial si bolometer can be mounted below the sample to perform transmission measurements .",

    "the dispersion of the high - energy resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b_dispersion_mp ] ) can be fitted in different ways using eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_cbr ] ) . on the one hand",
    ", the spin - orbit parameter @xmath29 can be used as a free parameter , taking the well - known @xmath31  factor of @xmath32 for bulk gaas@xcite .",

    "t ( blue curve ) and the field direction parallel to the surface normal , comparing a spectrum measured at @xmath37  t and a tilt angle of @xmath38 ( red curve ) . ]",
    "+ to rule out the possibility of such an enhanced @xmath31  factor ( e.g. , observed by nicholas @xmath39.@xcite ) as the origin of the high - energy resonance we use the fact that , in a tilted magnetic field , the cyclotron resonance position only depends on the magnetic field component normal to the 2deg while a spin contribution should depend on the total magnetic field@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilted_field ] we compare two photoconductivity spectra of sample b.1  , one with the magnetic field direction normal to the surface ( blue curve ) and the other with a magnetic field tilted by @xmath40 ( red curve ) . for a direct comparison",

    "( [ eq : def_cbr ] ) with a spin - orbit parameter of @xmath34  evm  ( ref . ) and a @xmath31  factor resulting from the above fit of the magnetic field dispersion ( @xmath36 ) we would expect at least a shift of @xmath41 to higher frequencies for the spectrum taken in the tilted magnetic field .",
    "experimentally , however , we do not observe any shift of the high - energy resonance for the tilted magnetic field measurement ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tilted_field ] ) .",
    "this clearly rules out an enhanced @xmath31  factor as the origin of the high - energy resonance observed in the present experiment . despite the similarity of our photoconductivity spectra [ figs .",
    "[ fig : b_sweep_schulter ] ( b ) and [ fig : b_sweep_n_sweep_cbr_dispersion ] ] with the spectra obtain from inas quantum wells@xcite , the assumption of a cbr could not explain the high - energy resonance observed in the present experiment on gaas heterostructures .",
    "+ therefore , a different approach is needed to explain the observations in the present work . in the following ,",
    "we suggest to interpret the high - energy resonance in terms of a collective many - body excitation , i.e. the magneto plasmon resonance ( mp ) .",
    "the @xmath42-field dispersion of the mp is given by @xcite @xmath43 with the plasmon frequency at zero magnetic field@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the plasmon wave vector , @xmath46 is the 2d electron density , and @xmath47 is the effective dielectric constant .",
    "performing photoconductivity measurements on conventional hall bar samples allows for the investigation of the mp without the need of a grating to couple the incident radiation with plasmons of a wave vector @xmath45 .",
    "as described , e.g. , by vasiliadou @xmath39.,@xcite the boundaries of a hall bar themselves provides the coupling and determine the frequency of the confined plasmon .",

    "( [ eq : def_mp ] ) and ( [ eq : def_p ] ) with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the width of the hall bar . but",
    "as shown in the previous section ( see fig . [",
    "fig : vgl_l_m ] ) , no shift of the high - energy resonance can be observed in the present experiment if the channel width is reduced from @xmath7 m ( sample b.1  ) to @xmath8 m ( sample b.2  ) , while a shift by the factor of @xmath50 is expected for @xmath51  [ see eq .",
    "[ eq : def_p ] ] .",
    "furthermore , we would expect to find the confined plasmon frequency in the ghz regime for our samples@xcite .",

    "( [ eq : def_mp ] ) , yields a plasmon frequency of @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath52  thz . for the mp picture to hold",
    "we need a characteristic length scale which is independent of the geometrical definition of the mesa and which is short enough to cause a plasmon frequency in the thz regime . + as reported by elliott @xmath39.@xcite an edge - induced magneto plasmon resonance ( eimp ) can be observed in measurements on a circular sheet of @xmath11he@xmath53 ions , where the resonance frequency is determined by the depletion length of the electron density profile at the sample edge .",

    "the solid red line represents the calculated eimp frequency as a function of the carrier density using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : def_p ] ) and ( [ eq : def_lcsg ] ) .",
    "the calculated values resembles the experimentally determined ones quite well , without the need for any fit parameter .",
    "the agreement over a broad range of carrier densities and also for different samples suggests that the origin of the high - energy resonance observed in the present experiment is indeed the excitation of a collective magneto plasmon oscillation , where the plasmon wave vector and thus the resonance frequency @xmath51 is given by the depletion length at the sample edge .",
    "so far , the microscopic excitation mechanism at the sample boundary and the influence of the compressible and incompressible stripes at different filling factors are not fully understood .",
    "as shown , e.g. , in ref . , the edge reconstruction in the quantum hall regime can have a pronounced influence on the photoconductive properties of 2degs beyond the collective bulk excitations .",
    "further theoretical work on thz response of the reconstructed edge in the quantum hall regime is therefore highly desirable .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the weak thz photoresponse , situated on the high - energy side of the cyclotron resonance , using spectrally resolved photoconductivity measurements in the quantum hall regime .",
    "we find that the magnetic field and the carrier density dependence of the resonance position is in a good agreement with an edge - induced magneto plasmon excitation , where the characteristic length scale ( plasmon wave vector @xmath45 ) is determined by the depletion length of the 2deg at the sample boundary .",
