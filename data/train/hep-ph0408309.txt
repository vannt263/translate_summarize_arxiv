    "the question of how constituent quarks arise dynamically has always been one of the most intriguing problems of qcd .",
    "the issue has prompted perturbative and nonperturbative approaches both in the continuum as well as on the lattice .",
    "politzer  @xcite was the first one to compute the quark mass function using the operator product expansion ( ope ) in the high momentum regime in terms of the quark condensate @xmath7 in the landau gauge .",
    "this calculation was corrected and extended to a general lorentz gauge by pascual and de rafael  @xcite .",
    "the gauge - independent gluon condensate @xmath6 was included by lavelle and schaden  @xcite , where it was also forseen that a dimension-2 condensate , @xmath0 , should be present .",
    "originally it was interpreted as a signature of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the dimension-4 mixed quark - gluon condensate , @xmath8 , was included in the analysis of lavelle and oleszczuk  @xcite .",
    "more recently , schwinger - dyson approaches ( for reviews see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) have been intensely applied in an attempt to understand the nonperturbative physics in the infrared domain .",
    "the phenomenological success of this approach has triggered a lot of activity on the lattice where the quark propagator has recently been computed after gauge fixing  @xcite .",
    "however , the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the matching to the ope is limited to the mass function .",
    "remarkably , the dimension-2 @xmath0 condensate is related to the quark wave function renormalization  @xcite .",
    "early implications of a non - vanishing dimension-2 condensate have been explored by celenza and shakin @xcite .",
    "more recently chetyrkin , narison , and zakharov @xcite found that the inclusion of a tachyonic gluon mass parameter @xmath9 improves the phenomenology of the qcd sum rules in mesonic channels .",
    "for heavy quarks @xmath10 is proportional to the string tension of a short string , so it provides the short - range behavior of confining forces .",
    "other phenomenological determinations of a non - vanishing gluon mass can be traced from the review  @xcite .",
    "although the dimension-2 @xmath0 condensate navely breaks gauge invariance in the perturbative sense , a detailed analysis reveals that this is not so . as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , there exists a nonlocal gauge invariant condensate , @xmath11 which reduces to the @xmath0 condensate in the landau gauge . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the group element .",
    "a physical meaning has also been attached to this condensate by a perturbative gauge - covariant redefinition of the gluon field  @xcite . further mounting evidence for the existence and physical relevance of the dimension-2 condensate in qcd",
    "has been also gathered from the lattice calculations  @xcite , analytic estimates  @xcite , purely theoretical considerations  @xcite , and microscopic approaches  @xcite .",
    "anomalous dimensions for the @xmath13 condensate were calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the comparison of numerical lattice qcd calculations with analytic continuum approaches , such as the perturbation theory , the operator product expansion , or the dyson - schwinger approaches , requires a local gauge fixing condition on the lattice .",
    "thereafter it is possible to give a meaning of quark and gluon correlation functions .",
    "however , it is well known that there is no known local gauge fixing condition free of the gribov copies ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , one should keep in mind that when fixing the gauge there may still be differences in physical observables which become non - analytic functions of the coupling constant due to the influence of the gribov copies .",
    "if one restricts , however , to the fundamental modular region by a partial local gauge fixing , there may still be gauge - invariant operators under the residual subgroup and the brst transformation  @xcite . in the landau",
    "gauge the only dimension-2 operator satisfying the above condition is precisely @xmath14 .    in the present work we extract the dimension-2 @xmath15 condensate by comparing the lattice results for the quark propagator in the landau gauge , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the ope results of refs .  @xcite .",
    "our determination yields a novel estimate of the gluon mass , @xmath16 , as well as provides the first determination of the mixed dimension-4 condensate , @xmath17 ( hereafter @xmath12 denotes the strong coupling constant ) .",
    "the inverse quark propagator can be parameterized as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , dependent on the quark momentum , have the meaning of the vector and scalar quark self - energies .",
    "an equivalent parameterization is via the wave - function renormalization , @xmath21 , and the mass function , @xmath22 , defined as @xmath23    the quark propagator was calculated in landau gauge using the `` asqtad '' improved staggered action .",
    "the gauge ensemble is made of 100 quenched , @xmath24 lattices with a nominal lattice spacing @xmath25 , set from the static quark potential .",
    "this data was first published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath22 and @xmath21 as functions of the euclidean momentum @xmath26 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mz ] at various values of the current quark mass @xmath27 . the data for @xmath22 asymptote at large @xmath26 to the value of @xmath27 , indicated by the horizontal lines .",
    "we note that the data at highest values of @xmath26 are not perfect , with some visible wiggles and a tendency of falling off at the end , which may be attributed to the finite - size effect . yet , up to @xmath28 the tails in @xmath22 and @xmath21 look very reasonably , reaching plateaus before `` hitting the wall '' .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the tail in @xmath22 in the `` fiducial '' region of @xmath29 was used successfully in ref .",

    "this shows that the data is accurate enough to be verified against the perturbative qcd predictions .    the data for @xmath38 from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mz ] . a very weak dependence on @xmath27 has been noted , except perhaps at low @xmath26 .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath39 , as requested by the canonical normalization of the quark fields . at lower values of @xmath26",
    "the departure of @xmath21 from unity is sizeable , with a long - range tail clearly visible .",
    "in our further analysis we will work with the function @xmath40 .",
    "the data for the vector quark self - energy @xmath40 may be parameterized at sufficiently large values of @xmath26 as @xmath41    in the fitting procedure we must decide on the matching region in @xmath26 .",
    "certainly , this choice will affect the results , yielding a systematic error .",
    "the values of @xmath26 can not be too large due to finite - size effects , nor too small , where the expansion  ( [ aexp ] ) is no longer accurate .",
    "we perform the @xmath42 fit in the range @xmath2 , which yields the optimum values @xmath43 the errors have been calculated by jackknife .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is @xmath45 , but one can see from the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] that there is a sizeable correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we have also performed the fit with three terms , appending formula ( [ aexp ] ) with the term @xmath48 .",
    "the result is @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 with errors that overlap with the central values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) .",
    "however , due to large correlations between @xmath47 and @xmath52 , no reliable information may be extracted from this three - parameter fit .",
    "more accurate data and a larger range of momenta will allow for a better determination of the @xmath53-expansion .",
    "next , we will compare the obtained values of eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) to theoretical predictions and extract estimates for the landau - gauge condensates . at @xmath54 the vector self - energy read out from the propagator of ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath55 where @xmath35 denotes the renormalization scale . comparing to eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) we find for three colors @xmath56 or @xmath57 and @xmath58 since @xmath59 @xcite , the contribution of the @xmath6 condensate to eq .",
    "( [ conda4 ] ) is negligible compared to the mixed - condensate term .",
    "the errors quoted throughout the paper are statistical .",
    "in addition , there are certain systematic errors originating from the choice of the fitted function @xmath40 of eq .",
    "( [ aexp ] ) and from the choice of the fiducial region in @xmath26 .",
    "quantities quoted in physical units are also subject to the uncertainty in scale that goes with quenched lattice simulations .",
    "the landau - gauge condensates considered in this paper are not renorm - invariant quantities , thus their values evolve perturbatively with the scale .",
    "the qcd evolution for @xmath15 has been worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the leading - order result @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond to evolution with no flavor .",
    "we use @xmath63)$ ] , with @xmath64 for the evolution at the leading order . the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) is equal to 9/44 , hence the evolution is very slow .",
    "for instance , the change of @xmath65 from @xmath66 up to @xmath3 results in a reduction of @xmath67 by 10% only .",
    "most estimates in the literature refer to the gluon mass , related to the @xmath15 by the formula @xmath68 . our estimate ( [ conda2 ] ) , when evolved with eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) from 2 to 10  gev@xmath69 , yields @xmath70 evolution from 1 to 10  gev@xmath69 gives @xmath71 , while evolution from 4 to 10  gev@xmath69 produces @xmath72 .",
    "these values are close to many estimates made in other approaches . in particular , most of the numbers listed in table  15 of the review of ref .",
    "@xcite and obtained by very different techniques are in the range 0.5 - 1.5  gev .",
    "we have attempted to match the ope to the quenched lattice data for the vector quark energy in the landau gauge . the obtained value of the dimension-2 landau - gauge gluon condensate , @xmath15 , of eq .",
    "( [ conda2 ] ) and the corresponding estimate for the gluon mass of eq .",
    "( [ mg ] ) are consistent with other estimates in the literature .",
    "thus the lattice provides an independent way of determining this condensate . the estimate for the dimension-4 mixed quark - gluon condensate of eq .",
    "( [ conda4 ] ) , made to our knowledge for the first time , is an order of magnitude larger compared to the @xmath6 condensate .",
