    "we highlight the important properties of dissipative solitons which justify the choice of our experimental parameters to realise soliton production .",
    "the polariton density varies strongly across the bright soliton profile reaching its maximum at the center , while the pump beam profile tends to hold the density at a quasi - constant level across the much larger pump spot @xcite .",

    "the role of the writing beam is to create a local perturbation of the pump state , which in turn results in soliton formation due to scattering from the pump state ( fig . [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "it has been shown numerically for linearly polarised polariton solitons that their velocity is close to the group velocity of the polaritons at the pump momentum @xcite . to test this prediction , we changed the momentum of the writing beam to half of the pump momentum , @xmath40 ( figs .",

    "the pump intensity is insufficient to maintain the system within the bistability region and thus to sustain solitons .",

    "whereas localisation in the x direction described above arises from the interplay between the negative effective mass and repulsive interactions , the origin of localisation along y is different .",

    "in order to provide further insight into our experimental observations , we have performed a series of numerical simulations .",
    "this is important since the previous theoretical studies of polariton solitons @xcite are restricted to the linearly polarized case , while in the present setting , with orthogonally polarised pump and writing beams , coupling between the two polarisations is important and leads to the formation of elliptically polarised solitons .",

    "firstly , we set the system to the upper state ( fig .",

    "<S> microcavity polaritons are composite half - light half - matter quasi - particles , which have recently been demonstrated to exhibit rich physical properties , such as non - equilibrium bose - einstein condensation , parametric scattering and superfluidity . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , polaritons have some important advantages over photons for information processing applications , since their excitonic component leads to weaker diffraction and stronger inter - particle interactions , implying , respectively , tighter localization and lower powers for nonlinear functionality . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first experimental observations of bright polariton solitons in a strongly coupled semiconductor microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the polariton solitons are shown to be non - diffracting high density wavepackets , that are strongly localised in real space with a corresponding broad spectrum in momentum space . unlike solitons known in other matter - wave systems such as bose condensed ultracold atomic gases , they are non - equilibrium and rely on a balance between losses and external pumping . </S>",
    "<S> microcavity polariton solitons are excited on picosecond timescales , and thus have significant benefits for ultrafast switching and transfer of information over their light only counterparts , semiconductor cavity lasers ( vcsels ) , which have only nanosecond response time .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    non - spreading localised wave - packets or solitons occur in a variety of non - linear classical and quantum photonic and matter - wave situations , where they reflect the distinct physical properties of the system under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> light only solitons were first discovered @xcite and most actively researched in optical fibers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fibers provide a very good experimental realisation of the one dimensional ( 1d ) nonlinear schrodinger ( nls ) equation - a paradigm model in soliton physics , which has simple soliton solutions shaped by opposing dispersive spreading and nonlinearity induced self - phase modulation of optical pulses . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the concept of optical solitons has been extended into the spatial domain , where diffraction of propagating beams can be compensated by nonlinear changes in the material refractive index @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> formally , anomalous group velocity dispersion is equivalent to diffraction : both require positive ( self - focusing ) kerr nonlinearity to form either temporal or spatial bright solitons @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , matter wave solitons have been demonstrated in bose condensed atomic gases , where the dispersive spreading of the localized wavepackets induced by the kinetic energy of positive mass atoms is balanced by the attractive interatomic interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interactions between the atoms used in condensation experiments are often repulsive . in order to create bright solitons in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the effective atomic mass must be made negative , as demonstrated using optical lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same effect can be achieved for light in photonic crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strong exciton photon coupling in microcavities results in an unusual and advantageous lower polariton branch dispersion exhibiting regions of either positive or negative effective mass @xcite depending on the values of transverse momentum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from positive to negative mass is associated with the point of inflection of the energy - momentum diagram , shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the negative mass of polaritons coupled with repulsive polariton - polariton interactions favour the formation of the bright solitons which we realise in the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> recent discoveries made with microcavity polaritons include condensation @xcite , vortices @xcite , superfluidity @xcite and follow a pathway similar to the one which led to the observation of coherent matter wave solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of low threshold bistability , polarization multistability @xcite and parametric scattering @xcite of polaritons have further prepared the necessary foundations for the realisation of half - light half - matter solitons . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to atomic systems , polariton microcavities operate under non - equilibrium conditions . </S>",
    "<S> atomic systems are typically described by conservative hamiltonian models , such as nls or gross - pitaevskii equations , while the polariton system is intrinsically non - hamiltonian . in the photonic context , this system is often referred to as dissipative , which implies the importance of losses , but also implicitly assumes the presence of an external energy supply @xcite . theoretically , conservative half - light half - matter solitons have been predicted in ref . </S>",
