    "the cold and superdense inner cores of compact stars are likely to consist of color superconducting quark matter . assuming that the very strong surface magnetic fields found in magnetars ( @xmath0  g ) can be transmitted to the their inner cores , it is worth studying whether the effects of strong magnetic fields on color superconductors are important for understanding the physics of magnetars . in ref .",
    "the effects of moderately strong magnetic fields on the properties of color - flavor locked ( cfl ) superconductors ( ref .  ) were studied numerically in the framework of a nambu - jona - lasinio model .",
    "it was shown that the ground state of 3-flavor quark matter undergoes a continuous crossover from the cfl phase into the magnetic cfl ( mcfl ) phase , which was initially introduced in ref .  .",
    "the free parameters of the model ( the diquark coupling constant and the ultraviolet cutoff ) were set to yield a cfl gap of either @xmath1  mev or @xmath2  mev when the quark chemical @xmath3 mev and @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the mcfl gaps display de haas - van alphen oscillations with respect to @xmath5 ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the magnetization of the system @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the one - loop quark contribution to the free energy evaluated at the stationary point .",
    "our numerical results for the magnetization are presented in fig .",
    "[ figmag ] .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the magnetization of hadronic matter is negligible even for magnetar conditions , i.e. , @xmath9 for @xmath10 . in the case of",
    "quark matter , however , the situation is very different . in fig .",
    "[ figmag ] we plotted @xmath11 versus @xmath5 for a mcfl superconductor .",
    "the magnetization is significantly larger in this case and it displays de haas - van alphen oscillations with very large amplitude .",
    "the large magnitude of these magnetic oscillations create regions in which @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the magnetic field present in the outer layers of the star .",
    "these regions correspond to unstable or metastable states where , depending on the geometry of the system , a transition into a magnetic domain configuration may occur .",
    "this could lead to a wealth of different physical phenomena .",
    "for instance , successive phase transitions coming from discontinuous changes of @xmath14 during the star s evolution can release a vast amount of energy that would heat up the star , which would then cool down by for example the emission of neutrinos . therefore , sudden bursts of neutrinos coming from magnetars with color superconducting cores even after the deleptonization period could be expected . on the other hand ,",
    "if a mixed phase with microscopic domains of nonequal magnetizations is formed , the relative size of domains with different magnetizations would change with @xmath15 in order to keep the average induced magnetic field @xmath14 continuous . in either case , since the magnitude of the fields involved is enormous the system could potentially release an immense amount of energy . if observed , this type of phenomena could help to distinguish magnetars with quark cores from their purely hadronic counterparts .",
