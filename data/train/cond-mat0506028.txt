    "during the last decade or so , the search and interest in the superconductivity of non - cu based oxides has extended from an effort to understand the pairing mechanism in the cuprates to a broader search of superconductivity in materials in which electron correlations are thought to play a determining role . to this end",
    ", researchers try to exploit a diverse range of factors , from the orbital degrees of freedom to the crystal structure of the material .",
    "a particularly interesting example is the recently discovered family of superconducting os - oxide @xmath5-pyrochlores _",
    "a_os@xmath1o@xmath2 , with @xmath0 = k , rb , and cs,@xcite which have superconducting transition temperatures @xmath6 k , 6.3 k , and 3.3 k , respectively . the pyrochlore structure is a network of corner sharing tetrahedra and is a geometrically frustrated spin system if the ions bear a localized magnetic moment interacting antiferromagnetically with their nearest neighbors .",
    "further , the os ions  located at the tetrahedra vertices  possess a formal oxidation state of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . as pointed out by hiroi and co - workers,@xcite compared to other transition metal pyrochlore oxides",
    ", this places these materials between cd@xmath1re@xmath1o@xmath9 ( re@xmath10 ) , which is a good conductor at low temperatures@xcite ( becoming superconductor at @xmath11 k ) and cd@xmath1os@xmath1o@xmath9 ( os@xmath12 ) , which is an insulator at low temperatures and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering.@xcite    while the several experimental results@xcite reported during the past year provide key information , the pairing mechanism in these materials is still under debate .",
    "these experiments indicate similarities but also differences among the compounds with different alkali metal , tending to single out kos@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "let us mention briefly some of the observations that should be taken into account by any proposed pairing mechanism .",
    "firstly , the very change in @xmath4 upon substitution of the alkali atom ( @xmath0 ) may be initially counterintuitive .",
    "indeed , the negative chemical pressure leads to an increase of the lattice constant with the ionic radius of @xmath0 , so that one may expect @xmath4 to increase because band narrowing should lead to an increase of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath3 ) . as shown by the reported @xmath4 s above",
    ", however , the opposite occurs . in line with these findings ,",
    "the change in @xmath4 under applied hydrostatic pressure is found to be positive initially in all these materials.@xcite this has been interpreted as suggesting that the pairing mechanism in these materials is unconventional , or non - bcs - like.@xcite of interest is the fact that in kos@xmath1o@xmath2 the increase of @xmath4 with pressure reaches a maximum at 0.56 gpa and tends to vanish gradually at higher pressures.@xcite       we thank lin - hui ye , s. h. rhim , j. b. ketterson , and w. halperin for helpful discussions .",
    "we are also grateful to b. barbiellini and g. grimvall for their suggestions and to b. battlogg and m. brhwiler for sharing data with us prior to publication .",
    "this work was supported by the department of energy ( under grant no .",

    "after the submission of this manuscript , muramatsu and co - workers reported new high pressure measurements ( pressures up to 10 gpa ) , showing that @xmath4 follows a similar trend in all three compounds with @xmath0=k , rb , and cs , and that under appropriate normalization the plots of @xmath4 _ vs. _ @xmath13 appear to fall under a same universal curve .",

    "* 30 * 561 ( 1984 ) .",
    "this result calls for similar measurements on the other os oxide @xmath5-pyrochlores , not least because , in addition , a second peak is observed in the @xmath14 curve , below the superconducting @xmath4 , which could indicate a further first - order or @xmath15-type phase transition .",
    "there are several formulas to calculate @xmath16 in the case of compounds [ see m .-",
    "huang , h. j. f. jansen , and a. j. freeman , phys .",
    "b * 37 * , 3489 ( 1988 ) , and references therein ] . in our case ,",
    "we think it is more sensible to take the average mass @xmath17 instead of the atomic masses @xmath18 , because it is known that the latter overweights the contribution of light atoms like o.      an estimate of a zero temperature @xmath19 from the elastic constants of these materials shows that it decreases with increasing size of @xmath0 , and one can expect @xmath20 to follow the same trend . however , it is known that @xmath20 generally decreases quadratically with temperature at low temperatures ( see , e.g. , g. grimvall , _ thermophysical properties of materials _ ( elsevier , amsterdam , 1999 ) , p. 97 ) , so that the observed decrease of @xmath4 with the size of @xmath0 is expected to result in @xmath20 at @xmath4 moving upward , tending to compensate the first effect .",
    "thus , we use the same @xmath20 for all the compounds in our calculations .",
    "it is difficult to know beforehand whether the correction of @xmath21 over @xmath22 is small or not for a given compound .",
    "however , the account presented here of the trends observed in experiment allows us _ a posteriori _ to expect that the correction will not be too large and that the physical content of our description will be preserved .                  in ref .",
    ", a calculation of the bare band susceptibility along the @xmath24-@xmath25 direction is reported for kos@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "although it appears not to suggest electronic instabilities , it does show clear nesting effects .",
    "we note that the constriction between the two closed fermi surfaces discussed above may have effects on the nesting ; in particular , it may degrade any nesting along the [ 111 ] direction in the case of the heavier alkali metals ."
