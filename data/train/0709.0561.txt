    "biological systems are inherently noisy , or _ stochastic_. a primary source of this noise is the random nature of molecular interactions that predominates when molecular copy numbers are low , so - called  intrinsic \" noise @xcite .",
    "intrinsic noise has been implicated as the source of non - genetic variability in clonal cell populations @xcite and can profoundly affect the dynamical behavior of a biological system , both to its benefit as well as its detriment @xcite . for example , stochastic effects in gene expression have been shown to speed the response of yeast cells to a challenge , allowing them to survive in conditions where they otherwise could not @xcite .",
    "conversely , noise can interfere with the workings of circadian clocks @xcite , systems whose reliability is essential for survival . as such , nature has developed regulatory mechanisms to attenuate the noise @xcite .",
    "all in all , accounting for the effects of stochasticity is _ essential _ for gaining a clear understanding of the design principles underlying many biological processes .",
    "nevertheless , biological - systems modeling today continues to be performed primarily at the continuous - deterministic scale , usually in the form of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "these formalisms explicitly _ ignore _ stochastic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , the practice understandably persists because the methods are well established and numerous easy - to - use algorithms are available at little to no cost . moreover , established stochastic methods , such as gillespie s stochastic simulation algorithm ( ssa ) @xcite , are in many cases simply too computationally intensive to apply to realistic models of biological networks @xcite .",
    "there is great interest , therefore , in developing accelerated stochastic simulation methods that can accurately capture noise effects but at significantly reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches .",
    "ultimately , it is hoped that these methods will supplant odes as the default method of choice in computational systems biology .",
    "approaches that have been proposed in this regard include ( but are not limited to ) : ( i ) modification and optimization of gillespie s original ssa @xcite , ( ii )  leaping \" methods which ignore the exact moments at which reaction firings occur @xcite , and ( iii )  hybrid \" methods which couple different simulation techniques ( e.g. , the ssa and odes ) into a single , overarching algorithmic framework @xcite . of these",
    ", leaping methods are particularly popular , presumably because of the sound theoretical foundation on which they stand @xcite .    despite their popularity , however , very few practical applications of leaping have appeared in the literature to date @xcite .",
    "this is a curious fact that has yet to be fully explored or explained .",
    "moreover , those applications that have appeared ( e.g. , @xcite ) are generally brief in their presentation of the algorithms used and do not report much by way of the capabilities and limitations of the method .",
    "thus , it is difficult , if not impossible , to project the potential utility of the approach onto other and more complex biological networks .    here",
    ", we address this issue by using the  partitioned leaping algorithm \" ( pla ) @xcite , a recently - introduced extension and variant of the @xmath0-leaping method of gillespie and co - workers @xcite , to systematically investigate the effects of stochasticity in two model biochemical reaction networks . the systems that we consider are intuitively simple yet they contain attributes that are ubiquitous to complex biological networks , such as enzyme catalysis and feedback control .",
    "we perform a detailed and in - depth investigation using leaping with the aim of illuminating both the capabilities and limitations of the method and , hence , aiding and motivating future applications of the approach .",
    "the pla operates on the same basic principles that underlie all leaping algorithms and its performance with respect to these systems can thus be seen as generally reflective of the entire class of method .",
    "that being said , there are certain aspects of the pla , which we will expound upon below , that make it particularly appealing from a practical point of view .",

    "the systems that we investigate are a core model for calcium oscillations in hepatocytes introduced by @xcite and the three - gene  repressilator \" of @xcite .",
    "these systems are relatively simple , yet they are not  toy \" problems in the sense that they contain non - trivial features that are ubiquitous to biochemical systems , such as enzyme catalysis and feedback control . moreover ,",
    "both systems emit large - amplitude oscillations which give rise to the kinds of wide disparities in species populations that leaping algorithms are specifically designed to cope with @xcite .",
    "all in all , these systems provide an ideal testbed for investigating the practical utility of leaping methods in computational systems biology .",
    "our investigation entails using the pla to probe behavioral changes that arise in these systems due to changes in various system properties .",
    "specifically , we investigate the transition from stochastic to deterministic behavior that accompanies increases in the system volume ( i.e. , population levels ) in the calcium - oscillations model and increases in the gene - protein binding and unbinding rate constants in the repressilator .",
    "the salient feature of our investigation is that we are able to ascertain , in a systematic way , the performance characteristics of the leaping algorithm over a wide spectrum of conditions .",

    "incorporating stochasticity into models of calcium oscillations is thus of high interest .",

    "@xcite , it was posited that large disparities in rate constants would prove to be the prime bottleneck for leaping algorithms .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : reptimings ] by the declining performance of the pla with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "it is for exactly this reason that we consider the reduced model of table  [ table : repreduced ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : repstatsdet ] and [ fig : repstatsadair ] , we have seen that the behavior of the full model approaches that of the reduced model with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "now , in fig .",
    "[ fig : reptimings ] we see that the performance of the pla is greatly enhanced by the model reduction .",
    "depending on exactly how we choose to implement the pla ( see @xcite for an explanation ) , we can achieve gains of between one and four orders of magnitude in both simulation steps and run times .",
    "additionally , it is important to note that reducing the model has very little effect on the performance of the ssa .",
    "in fact , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : reptimings ] that while the numbers of simulation steps required for the ssa remain virtually unchanged upon reducing the model , the cpu time actually _ increases _ by @xmath98% because of the higher complexity rate expressions in table  [ table : repreduced ] which impose additional computational burdens on the algorithm .",
    "our results indicate , therefore , that there is a distinct advantage to using model reduction in conjunction with leaping which is absent with regards to the ssa .",
    "using the scarcity of published practical applications of leaping as a backdrop , our aim in this article was to investigate the performance characteristics of a particular leaping algorithm , the pla , when applied to two non - trivial biological models under a variety of conditions .",
    "our hope was to identify the conditions under which leaping proves particularly beneficial and where it falters and , hence , provide a kind of guide that will aid and motivate future applications of the method .",
    "our use of the pla , as opposed to a different leaping algorithm , was based purely on expediency , given that we developed the method @xcite .",
    "however , the pla operates on the same basic principles as all leaping algorithms and its performance can thus be seen as generally reflective of the entire class of method .",
    "in other words , the accelerations that we have reported here are not wholly unique to the pla but are characteristic of the leaping methodology in general .",
    "similarly , the bottlenecking that we experienced in the face of fast - reversible reactions in the repressilator system can be expected to afflict all leaping algorithms .",
    "that being said , there are attributes of the pla that we believe set it apart from its various counterparts , and we would be remiss in not emphasizing these .",
    "foremost among these is its simplicity of implementation and ease of use .",
    "the algorithm is concise , straightforward and overcomes various technical difficulties ( e.g. , negative populations @xcite ) without the need for extensive auxiliary machinery @xcite .",
    "using the pla requires little more than a system definition ( reactions ) , rate expressions ( elementary or non - elementary ) and definition of three simple model - independent parameters [ ` @xmath99 ' , ` @xmath100 ' , ` @xmath101 ' ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) ] @xcite .",
    "also significant is the ability to force the algorithm to perform both deterministic and exact - stochastic simulations by simple manipulation of the classification parameters ( e.g. , setting ` @xmath99'@xmath102 or ` @xmath100'@xmath103 ) . in our case , this significantly simplified the noise quantification and step and timing analyses .",
    "tangibly speaking , our results clearly illustrate the great potential that leaping methods hold in computational systems biology .",
    "for both the calcium - oscillations model and the repressilator , we observed orders - of - magnitude accelerations relative to the ssa ( figs .",
    "[ fig : catimings ] and [ fig : reptimings ] ) that made quantifying stochastic effects in these systems possible . in the calcium - oscillations case ,",
    "this gave us access to subtle effects of stochasticity that would have been indiscernible otherwise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : castats ] ) . for the repressilator",
    ", we actually saw the greatest gains in situations where stochastic effects were _ most _ prevalent ( small @xmath59fig .",
    "[ fig : repstatsdet ] ) .",
    "this is a particularly intriguing result .",
    "gene regulation is a common feature of many biological models and our results indicate a great potential advantage to using leaping in cases of slow transcription - factor binding and unbinding ( such as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a critical aspect of the present study was our ability to identify conditions under which the leaping algorithm did _ not _ perform particularly well .",
    "in many ways , this may be more valuable in terms of advancing the use of leaping methods than is highlighting its strengths .",
    "the leaping algorithm clearly falters when applied to the full repressilator model ( table  [ table : reprxns ] ) with large telegraph factor @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reptimings ] ) . intuitively , it is easy to understand why this is .",
    "the basic strategy underlying all leaping algorithms is to allow , at each simulation step , as many reaction firings as possible without the reaction rates in the system changing  appreciably \" @xcite .",
    "however , in this case there is only a single copy of each gene .",
    "thus , only a single binding / unbinding event is possible at each simulation step because one firing changes the binding / unbinding rates from either finite values to zero or vice versa , which is obviously appreciable .",
    "when @xmath59 is small , this is not a problem because the time interval between successive binding and unbinding events is large enough so that many transcription , translation and degradation reactions can fire .",
    "when @xmath59 is large , however , this is no longer the case .",
    "the numbers of reaction firings become limited due to the high frequency of binding and unbinding , and in the extreme limit the effect is such that the performance of the algorithm approaches that of the ssa ( i.e. , one reaction firing per step  fig .",
    "[ fig : reptimings ] ) .",
    "we can generalize this observation by saying that small reaction subnetworks ( pairs of reversible reactions in this case ) that have small populations and large rate constants are prime bottlenecks for leaping algorithms .",
    "fortunately , our results also illustrate how one can surmount such problems . by applying a simple rapid - equilibrium assumption to the first four reactions of table  [ table : reprxns ]",
    ", we were able to recover the behavior of the full model for @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : repstatsadair ] ) at significantly reduced computational cost ( fig .  [ fig : reptimings ] ) @xcite .",
    "this includes accurately capturing stochastic effects associated with finite numbers of mrnas and proteins .",
    "interestingly , we also showed that reducing the model has little effect on the performance of the ssa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reptimings ] ) .",
    "thus , the chief benefit to using model reduction in this case was _ not _ in reducing the number of reactions that had to be considered , but rather in increasing the size of the time step that could be traversed at each simulation step .",
    "this is a different perspective on the issue than is usual and strongly suggests that leaping and model reduction should be viewed , not as alternative approaches to the problem of timescale separation ( as is common ) , but as _ complementary_. integrating leaping with advanced model - reduction schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ) is thus an area of great future interest . as a final note , we did observe some ( small ) disagreement between the pla and the ssa results ( figs .",
    "[ fig : castats]_a _ , [ fig : castats]_b _ and [ fig : repstatsdet]_d _ ) which may be due to the inclusion of the reduced reaction types .",
    "this is an issue that will be investigated further in the future .",
    "so , given the effectiveness of the leaping algorithm as demonstrated in this article , why are practical applications of leaping so scarce in the literature ?",
    "the answer is likely multifaceted .",
    "first , the approach is relatively new and many researchers may simply be unaware , or only vaguely aware , of its existence .",
    "second , newer incarnations of the method are becoming increasingly complex , to the point that , even if aware of their existence , a non - expert may be unable to implement them .",
    "third , it has been our experience that there is a common misperception that stochastic simulation algorithms can only be applied to sets of _ elementary _ reaction types .",
    "indeed , it is common practice when investigating the stochastic characteristics of an established biochemical model to first  deconstruct \" it into elementary reaction steps . while this is not , in fact , strictly necessary , it is possible that attempts to use leaping algorithms in this way have befallen the bottleneck of fast - reversible reactions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : reptimings ] .",
    "it is our hope that this article alleviates , to some extent , each of these hindrances to the expanded use of leaping algorithms in computational systems biology .",
    "for we believe that the future of these methods is bright .",
    "leaping methods represent a small but important piece of the larger puzzle that is comprehensible and actionable models of complex biochemical processes . coupled with advanced model - reduction techniques that address the problem of rate constant disparities",
    ", they can provide a sound and practical means by which the problem of timescale separation in biological systems can be overcome .",
