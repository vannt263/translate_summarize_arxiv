    "more than a decade of extensive search for extra - solar planets has resulted in nearly 300 planets .",
    "majority of the contribution to the extra - solar planet count comes from radial velocity method .",
    "radial velocity data is traditionally analyzed first by a periodogram @xcite for the orbital period and then for the other orbital parameters using conventional optimization methods .",
    "bayesian methods for the estimation of orbital parameters of extra - solar planets were introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their work shows that these methods provide us a framework to tackle the problems associated with the traditional methods in a transparent and robust manner .",
    "exofitlahav / exofit.html ] of @xcite is the first publicly available package for bayesian estimation orbital parameters from radial velocity measurements . in this article",
    "we discuss the application of exofit to the radial velocity data of hd155358 and compare our results with the published orbital solution @xcite .",
    "we also show , by analyzing a randomly selected sample of radial velocity data from _ www.exoplanet.eu _ that exofit disagrees with the published orbital eccentricities in many instances while the orbital periods from exofit matches closely with the published ones .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section  [ modeling ]",
    "we give a brief introduction to radial velocity modeling .",
    "section  [ sec : paraest ] describes bayesian approach to parameter estimation .",
    "exofit is introduced in section  [ sec : exofit ] and its application to the radial velocity data is discussed in section  [ sec : hd155358 ] .",
    "section  [ sec : exofitvseu ] explains the analysis of radial velocity data of a sample of stars taken form",
    "_ www.exoplanet.eu _ using exofit .",
    "we conclude this article in section  [ sec : summary ] and provide an outline on planned work .",
    "radial velocity data consists of a set of measured radial velocity entries , corresponding time of observation and the uncertainty in each measurement . observed radial velocity data is modeled by the equation @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the measured radial velocity data for the @xmath3th instant of time @xmath4 , @xmath5 is true radial velocity of the star , @xmath6 is the measurement error assigned by the observer and @xmath7 represents any unknown noise present ( e.g. , signal from another planet ) in the data . for a statistician , @xmath7 is a nuisance parameter .",
    "the true radial velocity can be simulated using a mathematical model . disregarding any interactions between planets , the radial velocity of a star for a typical @xmath8-planet model",
    "can be approximately written as a linear combination of @xmath8 single planet radial velocities .",
    "thus , @xmath9 where @xmath10 represent the systematic velocity , amplitude , true anomaly , eccentricity and the longitude of periastron respectively . for the full formalism see the user s guide to exofit .",
    "bayesian paradigm has its origins in an article published posthumously by rev .",
    "thomas bayes in 1763 .",
    "since then the theorem has played a central part in probabilistic inference .",
    "for latest examples in cosmology see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "bayesian methods for the estimation of orbital parameters of extra - solar planets were introduced by @xcite and @xcite and their research show that this approach has an edge over the traditional methods when dealing with for e.g. , highly eccentric orbits .",
    "these methods also provide a straight forward way of dealing with nuisance parameters and a robust way of estimating uncertainties associated with the estimates of orbital parameters .",
    "bayes theorem for a set of parameters @xmath11 in model @xmath12 and data @xmath13 can be written as , @xmath14 in the above equation @xmath15 is the posterior probability distribution of parameters , @xmath16 is the likelihood of the data , @xmath17 represents the prior probability distribution of the parameters and @xmath18 is called the bayesian evidence . for parameter estimation problems",
    "we could simply write the above equation as @xmath19    computing the right hand side of equation  [ eqn : posteriorprob ] is the central point of any bayesian parameter estimation .",
    "analytical solutions can be derived for some special cases . however , in general we use numerical methods to compute the posterior distribution .",
    "although many approximation methods exist , this area is dominated by markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) and other sampling methods .",
    "these rely on the a random walk through the parameter space and make use of the fact that posterior density is proportional to the number of points visited in the volume considered .",
    "we calculate the marginal posterior distribution of each parameter by simple plotting a histogram of the final set of samples .",
    "bayesian modeling of the problem consists of defining each of the components mentioned in equation  [ eqn : posteriorprob ] .",
    "this will be discussed from the context of estimation of orbital parameters when we apply exofit to the published radial velocity data of hd155358 in section  [ sec : hd155358 ] .",
    "exofit is an easy to use documented software for estimating the orbital parameters from radial velocity measurements and it is freely available .",
    "it is based on bayesian mcmc method and is implemented in an object oriented framework in c++ .",
    "it can be easily extended to analyze the radial velocity data of more than two planets as well as data from transit photometry .",
    "output of exofit is a set of posterior samples .",
    "these can be analyzed using any standard statistical software .",
    "this explained in user s guide which can be download from exofit websitelahav / exofit.html ] .",
    "we also provide sample script for r statistical environment to analyze posterior samples . improved parameterization for the problem and novel sampling techniques for exofit are under development .",
    "in this section we develop a bayesian model for the parameter estimation and apply exofit to extract the orbital parameters of the companions of hd155358 .",
    "we start by defining the likelihood of the data .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ modeling ] we assume that the data consists of true radial velocity and some noise .",
    "the component of noise arising from the known measurement errors @xmath6 is assumed to be normally distributed with standard deviation @xmath20 for the @xmath3th entry in the data .",
    "the probability distribution for the unaccounted noise component @xmath7 is chosen to a gaussian distribution with finite variance @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the distribution of the combination @xmath22 can be considered as a gaussian with a variance of @xmath23 .    assuming each measurement error @xmath6 to be independent and since they follow a gaussian distribution , the likelihood of data can be written as a product @xmath24 gaussians@xcite where @xmath24 is the number of entries in the data .",
    "therefore , @xmath25\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26\\,.\\ ] ] thus , our parameter space is @xmath27 , first 11 from the mathematical model and last one representing the nuisance parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter is @xmath28 is defined for computational purposes and marks the periastron passage time as function period @xmath29 . for more details",
    "please consult exofit user s guide .",
    "table  [ tab : prior12 ] , taken from @xcite gives the prior probability distributions of each parameter in the model .",
    "these priors are chosen in such a way that they allow likelihood term in the equation  [ eqn : posteriorprob ] to dominate the posterior distribution and thus ensuring inference to be drawn from the observed data .",
