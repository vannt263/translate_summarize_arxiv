    "for a long time there was a general opinion that effect of electromagnetic field on a superconductor should always lead to a reduction of the energy gap @xmath0 , the critical current @xmath1 , the critical magnetic field @xmath2 and the critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "however , an increase of the critical current of a thin narrow superconducting bridge near its critical temperature under an influence of high - frequency electromagnetic field has been reported in 1966 in reference @xcite . later this phenomenon has been observed in almost all types of superconducting weak links .",
    "this effect has been explained in the aslamazov ",
    "larkin theory only in 1978 @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of enhancement of superconductivity has also been found in narrow superconducting channels ( single - crystal filaments ( whiskers ) and thin ( the thickness @xmath4 ) , narrow ( the width ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) films ) .",
    "here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the coherence length and the penetration depth of a weak magnetic field perpendicular to the film , respectively , @xmath9 the london penetration depth . in 1970",
    "eliashberg g.m . has proposed a microscopic theory @xcite , which considers the effect of electromagnetic irradiation on the energy gap @xmath0 of a superconductor .",
    "the eliashberg theory explained the phenomenon of enhancement in a superconducting channel , and this theory did not exclude a possibility of its existence in wide films .",
    "however , decades had passed , but this phenomenon could not been found in wide films .",
    "after the discovery of high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) , which caused an increased research activity , there has been a series of works devoted to the experimental study of an effect of microwave irradiation on the superconducting properties of htsc films .",
    "reference @xcite was among the first which mentioned the finding of the effect of superconductivity enhancement in htsc films . that paper shows a family of i - v characteristics ( ivc ) for wide ( w@xmath10 m ) and long ( l@xmath11 m ) bridge of an epitaxial film of @xmath12 .",
    "in the ivc it is seen that for low ( @xmath13  w ) power the critical current @xmath1 as well as the superconducting one @xmath14 increase compared to the values in the absence of microwave irradiation , indicating the enhancement of superconductivity by an electromagnetic field . with a further increase in power of microwave irradiation the critical superconducting current decreases , and harmonic and sub - harmonic steps of the current appear at voltages on the bridge @xmath15 related to the frequency of an external electromagnetic field @xmath16 by the josephson relation : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are integers",
    ", @xmath19 is planck s constant , @xmath20 is the electron charge .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite suggest that the mechanism responsible for the increase of @xmath1 and @xmath14 in the investigated bridges of htsc is an energy diffusion of quasiparticles in a contact area caused by a `` jitter '' of the potential well due to microwave irradiation @xcite .",
    "it is this mechanism of enhancement of superconductivity that was also found in cuprate htsc by other experimenters .",
    "for example , in studying the dependence of the superconducting current on the irradiation power in @xmath12 samples @xcite .",
    "it was found that it is the aslamazov ",
    "larkin mechanism of enhancement @xcite characteristic of superconducting weak links that is responsible for increasing the superconducting current under microwave irradiation .",
    "unfortunately , preliminary studies of the effect of superconductivity enhancement in cuprate htsc caused by the aslamazov  larkin mechanism @xcite have not been continued .",
    "the phenomenon of superconductivity enhancement by microwave irradiation in quasi - one - dimensional films ( narrow channels ) already belongs to classical effects in the physics of superconductivity .",
    "the experimental manifestation of this effect in a narrow channel is an increase of its critical temperature @xmath3 and the ginzburg -landau critical current @xmath21 .",
    "when a current flowing through a channel is greater than the current @xmath21 , the narrow channel comes to the resistive current state caused solely by the appearance of phase - slip centers .",
    "in contrast , in high - quality superconducting wide films ( @xmath22 ) in excess of the critical current @xmath23 the vortex state appears , so - called flux flow regime .",
    "a wide film is in this regime until the transport current reaches the maximum current @xmath24 at which in a wide film a vortex structure of the resistive state vanishes @xcite , and the first phase slip line ( psl ) appears . in 2001",
    "it has been experimentally observed @xcite , that in response to a microwave field not only the critical current @xmath23 increases but the maximum current of existence of the vortex resistivity @xmath24 does so . in this connection ,",
    "the problem of superconductivity enhancement in wide films is particularly interesting , as it requires consideration of behavior in a microwave field of both the critical current @xmath23 and the maximum current of existence of the vortex resistive state @xmath24 .",
    "a microscopic theory of superconductivity enhancement of films , uniform in the order parameter , by a microwave field was proposed by eliashberg @xcite and developed in references @xcite .",
    "the theory applies to relatively narrow @xcite and thin ( @xmath25 ) films in which the spatial distribution of microwave power and accordingly the enhanced gap are uniform over the film cross section . at the same time , the length of scattering of an electron by impurities @xmath26 should be small compared with the coherence length .    to understand properly behavior of superconductors with an energy gap in an alternating electromagnetic field it was necessary to take into account both the processes of absorption of electromagnetic energy by quasiparticles ( electrons ) , and the inelastic processes of scattering of the absorbed energy .    to illustrate the physical nature of the effect of superconductivity enhancement",

    "this shift in the electron distribution function , as seen in equation , results in an increase of the gap and thus enhances the superconducting properties .",
    "a change of @xmath31 is proportional to the field intensity @xmath32 ( for not too large @xmath33 ) and the relaxation time of energy excitations @xmath30 .",

    "this expression for the parameter @xmath80 will be used below in the formula for enhanced critical current in its comparison with experimental results .",
    "it is interesting to note that prior to reference @xcite , to our knowledge , the temperature dependencies of the enhanced critical current , arising from , were not compared directly with experimental data for @xmath81 .",
    "we point out , however , that attempts to compare , at least qualitatively , experimental dependencies @xmath81 with the eliashberg theory have been made .",
    "for example , in reference @xcite the authors presented the pair - breaking current of ginzburg  landau , using for the equilibrium gap , in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the magnetic flux quantum . since the temperature dependence of the enhanced critical current in a narrow channel appeared to be close to equilibrium in its shape , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the superconducting transition temperature in a microwave field , the @xmath81 was approximated by an expression similar to @xmath86 where the stimulated energy gap @xmath87 was calculated in the eliashberg theory at zero superconducting current ( at @xmath88 ) .",
    "after that , assuming @xmath89 and using the value of the microwave power as a fitting parameter , the authors of reference @xcite fitted calculated values of @xmath81 to experimental data with a certain degree of accuracy .",
    "it is clear that such a comparison of experimental results with the eliashberg theory is only a qualitative approximation , and can not be used to obtain quantitative results @xcite .",

    "second , the pair - breaking curves @xmath91 in the equilibrium state ( p = 0 ) and with a microwave field are very different @xcite .",
    "finally , as shown in references @xcite for @xmath92 the enhanced order parameter @xmath87 tends to a finite ( but small ) value @xmath93 and abruptly vanishes at @xmath94 , while the critical current vanishes continuously ( without a jump ) at @xmath95 and , therefore , can not in general be satisfactorily described by the formula of the type .",
    "this is evidenced by a marked deviation of the dependence from experimental points in the close vicinity of @xmath3 . in this review",
    ", an analysis of experimental data is based on the exact formula with using the numerical solution of .",
    "upon enhancement of superconductivity by an electromagnetic field the superconducting gap @xmath0 is , strictly speaking , variable in space and time .",
    "however , for sufficiently thin and narrow superconducting samples the dependence of @xmath0 on coordinates can be neglected . moreover ,",
    "near @xmath3 the relaxation time of the order parameter @xmath96 is large compared to the inverse frequency of stimulating microwave radiation ( @xmath97 ) , and the temporal oscillations of @xmath0 can also be neglected .",
    "therefore , the microscopic theory of eliashberg @xcite included neither the time nor spatial variations of the order parameter in a sample .    to realize experimentally the case discussed in this theory of a spatially homogeneous non - equilibrium state of a superconductor in a high - frequency field it was necessary to ensure the constancy of the energy gap over the sample volume ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is a purely technological problem .",
    "it was also important to ensure a uniform distribution of the transport current through the sample volume .",
    "failure to do so resulted in a non - uniform distribution of @xmath0 due not to technological reasons , but because of the dependence of the energy gap on the transport current @xmath99 .",
    "finally , it was important to provide an efficient heat transfer from a sample .",
    "it was shown that narrow superconducting film channels deposited on relevant substrates best met these requirements .",
    "the theory proposed in @xcite has been fully confirmed in experimental studies of such samples ( see , e.g. , references @xcite and @xcite ) .    for wider films , electro dynamical changes of @xmath0 over the film width with a non - uniformly distributed current and with the presence of intrinsic vortices can not be neglected .",
    "therefore , the theory @xcite , strictly speaking , does not apply in the case of wide films . yet , although it is difficult to develop a theory in the case of a non - uniform distribution of @xmath0 in a superconductor , in principle there should also be an effect of enhancement of superconductivity in this case .    in 2001 , the enhancement of superconductivity by an external electromagnetic field has also been found in wide , @xmath100 , high - quality superconducting films of tin @xcite with a non - uniform spatial distribution of @xmath99 over the sample width .",
    "it has been experimentally shown that under an external electromagnetic field not only the critical current @xmath1 increases but also the current of formation of the first phase - slip line ( see ) does so . in reference",
    "@xcite , this current is designated as @xmath101 .",

    "a physical meaning of the current @xmath103 is that it is the maximum current , at which a steady uniform flow of intrinsic vortices of the transport current across a wide film is still possible . if it is exceeded , @xmath104 , the vortex structure collapses , and in its place there appears a structure of phase - slip lines @xcite .",
    "it is the phase that determines the resistivity of a sample for a further increase in the transport current .    in this connection",

    "in contrast , the current @xmath103 is the maximum current at which a uniform flow of vortices across the film is still possible .",

    "it lies in increasing the energy gap , caused by the redistribution of nonequilibrium quasiparticles to higher energies under a microwave field @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is not entirely obvious for wide films with a non - uniform current distribution across the sample width .",
    "a similarity of enhancement mechanisms in narrow channels and wide films can be supported by the following observations . despite an increase of the current density , near the edges of a wide film the main current , both transport and induced by a microwave field ,",
    "is distributed over the entire film width .",
    "thus , the nonequilibrium of quasiparticles in a wide film , as in a narrow channel , is excited by a microwave field within an entire volume of a superconductor , and therefore , the effect of enhancement in wide films undergoes a certain quantitative modification due to non - uniform current distribution . in this regard ,",
    "we emphasize a significant difference in the conditions of formation of nonequilibrium under a microwave field in wide films and bulk superconductors , in which up to now the effect of enhancement was not observed . in the latter case ,",
    "the total current is concentrated in a thin meissner layer of the thickness of @xmath226 near the surface of the metal , which leads to an additional relaxation mechanism : the spatial diffusion of nonequilibrium quasiparticles excited by the microwave field , from the surface into the equilibrium volume .",
    "an intensity of this mechanism is determined by time @xmath227 during which quasi - particles leave meissner layer , which at typical temperature is three to four orders of magnitude less than the inelastic relaxation time .",
    "this high efficiency of the diffusion mechanism of relaxation , apparently , leads to suppression of the effect of enhancement in bulk superconducting samples @xcite .",
    "the current state of a wide film , despite the semblance with the meissner state of a bulk current - carrying superconductor is qualitatively different from the latter .",
    "while in a bulk superconductor the transport current is concentrated in a thin surface layer and decays exponentially at a distance of the london penetration depth @xmath9 away from the surface , in a wide film the current is distributed over its entire width @xmath106 according to approximating power law @xmath228^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath229 is the transverse coordinate @xcite .",
    "thus , the characteristic length @xmath230 ( @xmath107 is the film thickness ) , called in the theory of the current state of wide films usually as a penetration depth of perpendicular magnetic field , in fact defines not a spatial scale of the current decay for outgoing from the edges , but a magnitude of the edge current density , acting as a `` cut - off '' factor in the above - mentioned law of the current density distribution at distances @xmath231 away from the film edges @xcite .    being based on a qualitative difference between the current states in bulk and thin - film superconductors , one can argue that moderate non - uniformity of the current distribution in wide films does not cause fatal consequences for the effect of enhancement , and that the diffusion of nonequilibrium quasiparticles excited in the whole bulk of a film , making only minor quantitative deviations from the eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite used a modeling approach to account for these deviations by introducing a numerical form factor of the current distribution in for the enhanced critical current of eliashberg .",
    "they evaluated this form factor by fitting the limiting case of at zero - power microwave irradiation , i.e. , for measured values of the equilibrium critical current .",
    "they then used the obtained values of the form factor in for @xmath232 , to yield a good agreement with the experimental data ( see ) .",
    "noteworthy is the question of how the eliashberg s mechanism `` works '' in a wide film in narrow channels the superconductivity is destroyed due to the mechanism of homogeneous pair - breaking of ginzburg - landau , while in a wide film the superconductivity is destroyed due to the emergence of vortices .",
    "we believe that in this case the enhancement of the energy gap leads to a corresponding increase of the barrier for entering vortices , and that enhances the critical current in a wide film @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are no significant features in the curves @xmath23 , when upon decreasing the temperature the films go from the regime of a narrow channel to the regime of a wide vortex film .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the transition between the regimes of a uniform pair - breaking and vortex resistivity affect neither the value nor the temperature dependence of the critical current .    to complete the discussion of the effect of superconductivity enhancement ,",
    "we attract an attention to the empirical fact that all the theoretical curves for @xmath81 , derived from the equations of the eliashberg theory , are well approximated by a power law @xmath233 .",
    "this law is very similar to the temperature dependence of the pair - breaking current of ginzburg - landau , in which the critical temperature @xmath3 is replaced with its enhanced value @xmath85 .",
    "the explicit expressions for such approximating dependencies with numerical coefficients are given in the captions to and .",
    "the other important result of these studies is significant expansion of temperature range near the superconducting transition temperature , where a film behaves as a narrow channel during enhancement of superconductivity : in a microwave field , the crossover temperature in the wide film regime @xmath220 is significantly reduced compared to its equilibrium value @xmath154 , while @xmath234 . at first glance , this result is somewhat contrary to the criterion of the transition between the different regimes of a superconducting film : @xmath235 @xcite since an increase of the energy gap upon irradiation implies a reduction of the @xmath169 and , consequently , reduction of the characteristic size of vortices .",
    "this obviously makes easier the conditions for entry of vortices into a film .",
    "consequently , the crossover temperature is expected to increase in a microwave field .",
    "however , it appears that the mechanism of an influence of microwave radiation on vortices is somewhat different .",
    "so , it was found that a wide film with a vortex region in ivc under a microwave field behaves like a narrow channel : the vortex region in ivc disappears ( see , e.g. , ,   ( @xmath147 ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that this kind of ivc may be in two cases . in the first case , under the influence of a microwave field",

    "this behavior of @xmath81 suggests that under the microwave field of @xmath16 = 12.9  ghz in the temperature range @xmath239 there are no vortices in the sample snw10 .",
    "otherwise , in , in the temperature range @xmath240 the values of @xmath81 would be lower compared with the theoretical curve 5 calculated within the eliashberg theory .",
    "moreover , the crossover would be seen in the dependence @xmath81 upon entering vortices .",

    "it turns out that the critical current enhanced by a microwave field in this case can also be well approximated by a similar dependence : @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath212 in a wide film there is a linear temperature dependence of the equilibrium critical current @xcite . almost at the same temperatures the enhanced critical current can also be approximated by the linear dependence @xmath257 @xcite",
    "based on the above experimental facts , one can also try to approximate the temperature dependencies of the current @xmath258 , enhanced by a microwave field , by a dependence similar to for the equilibrium case .",

    "first , we consider the behavior of the current at which the first psl appears , @xmath24 , without an external electromagnetic field ( see , ( ) ) .",

    "since the theory @xcite , in which the definition @xmath24 is introduced , assumes a linear temperature dependence of the critical current @xmath271 then , strictly speaking , should be applicable only in the temperature range @xmath212 , where such a dependence of the critical current is observed .",
    "however , as seen in , for the equilibrium dependence @xmath24 and  for the case of enhancement of @xmath258 by an electromagnetic field sufficiently well describe the experimental dependencies in the case of @xmath272 too .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that at @xmath212 and @xmath272 the resistive current states at @xmath273 differ little from each other : both of these states are characterized by fairly uniform current distribution over the width of the sample due to the quite dense filling of the film by a lattice of vortices @xcite .",
    "thus , the experimental temperature dependencies of the enhanced current @xmath258 are well approximated by ",
    ", similar to formula for the equilibrium case of the aslamazov ",
    "lempitsky theory @xcite , where the critical temperature @xmath3 is replaced by the enhanced critical temperature @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "consider the behavior of @xmath258 of the sample snw5 in a microwave field with the frequency @xmath16=9.2  ghz ( ( @xmath147 ) ) .",
    "it can be seen that upon irradiation of the film by microwave power there is the enhancement of @xmath274 up to @xmath165=3.708  k. at temperatures @xmath275  k the enhancement of @xmath258 was not observed . for the irradiation of the sample snw5 by microwave field with the frequency @xmath16=12.9  ghz the enhancement of @xmath276 is observed up to @xmath165=3.690  k. at lower temperatures the enhancement of @xmath258 was not found . for the irradiation of the sample snw5 by microwave field with the frequency @xmath16=15.2  ghz ( , ( @xmath125 ) ) enhancement of @xmath277 is observed up to @xmath165 = 3.655  k. at temperatures @xmath278  k the enhancement of @xmath258 was not observed .",
    "it should be noted that in it is seen that @xmath279 .",
    "thus , an absolute value of @xmath258 increases with the irradiation frequency , and the temperature region of enhancement of @xmath258 is extended toward lower temperatures @xcite . by the way",
    ", in the same way behaves a critical current @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "let us try to find an explanation for this .",
    "we take into account two factors .",
    "first of all , as already noted , in wide films at @xmath273 the current distribution across the width of the film is close to uniform . in this case",
    "it is wise to make use of the knowledge accumulated for narrow channels .",
    "second , the source of enhanced critical parameters @xmath258 and @xmath81 of a superconductor is a non - equilibrium distribution function of quasiparticles over energy . in this case",
    ", first of all the value of the energy gap increases @xcite .",
    "= 9.2  ghz ; curve 3 , @xmath16=15.2  ghz ) . , height=288 ]    with taking into account the above arguments , in the curve 1 represents a temperature dependence of the equilibrium gap @xmath280 ( in frequency units ) , and the curves 2 and 3 show temperature dependencies of the enhanced gap @xmath281 for the sample snw5 at the irradiation frequencies of 9.2 and 15.2  ghz , assuming a uniform distribution of the transport current density over the cross section . in the figure",
    "it is seen that the upper branch of the temperature dependence of the energy gap enhanced in a superconductor , @xmath281 , intersects with a similar dependence of the equilibrium gap @xmath280 .",
    "moreover , the higher the irradiation frequency , the lower in the temperature is the point of intersection of dependencies @xmath281 and @xmath280 ( @xmath282 ) , where the enhancement of the energy gap ceases .",
    "it should be noted that the temperature ranges where the non - equilibrium values of the energy gap and the currents exceed the equilibrium values do not coincide .",
    "the reason for this lies in a significant difference between the curves of pair - breaking @xmath283 in equilibrium and non - equilibrium cases @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the maximum enhanced critical temperatures @xmath284  k at the irradiation frequency of 9.2  ghz and @xmath285  k at the frequency of microwave field 15.2  ghz , derived from theoretical curves 2 and 3 in , are in a good agreement with the values of @xmath85 , obtained by fitting the experimental curves @xmath258 ( see ) .",
    "in the present review , the behavior of the critical current @xmath1 and the maximum current @xmath103 at which in a wide film a vortex structure of the resistive state disappears and the first phase - slip line arises is analyzed in thin superconducting films of different width , located in a microwave field .",
    "a enhancement of superconductivity by an external electromagnetic field was found in wide @xmath22 , superconducting films @xcite with a non - uniform spatial distribution of the current over the sample width .",
    "the superconductivity enhancement in a wide film increases not only the critical current @xmath1 , but also the maximum current at which there is a vortex resistive state , @xmath103 @xcite . in the framework of the eliashberg theory an equation for the enhanced critical current was derived and expressed in terms of experimentally measured quantities @xcite . a comparison of experimental temperature dependencies of the enhanced critical current with those calculated in the framework of the eliashberg theory revealed a good agreement between them @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that near the superconducting transition the temperature dependence of the enhanced critical current in not very wide films ( @xmath286 ) appears to be numerically very close to the law @xmath287 for the equilibrium pair - breaking critical current when @xmath3 is replaced with the enhanced critical temperature @xmath85 .",
    "it was found @xcite , that for sufficiently wide films ( @xmath288 ) the enhanced critical current has a linear temperature dependence @xmath289 , similar to that in the equilibrium theory of aslamazov  lempitsky with replacement of @xmath3 by @xmath85 .",
    "experimental dependencies of the enhanced critical current @xmath290 and the enhanced current of formation of the first psl , @xmath291 , on power and frequency of microwave irradiation were obtained in thin ( thickness @xmath292 ) superconducting films of different width @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "it was found experimentally that when the film width increases , the range of irradiation power , at which the effect of superconductivity enhancement is observed , shrinks abruptly , and hence the probability of its detection decreases @xcite .",
    "this statement is an answer to the question on much delayed discovery of the enhancement effect in wide films .",
    "it is established that with an increase of the film width the ratio @xmath123 , at which there is a maximum enhancement effect , is reduced , and the effect of enhancement of the critical current in wider films is observed at lower irradiation power , since in the microwave range the value of @xmath128 is practically independent of frequency @xcite .",
    "the power , at which the maximum effect of enhancement is observed , increases with the frequency of microwave irradiation .",
    "it was found that when the film width increases , the curvature sign of a descending section in the dependence @xmath293 is changed @xcite .",
    "studies of the critical current enhanced by a microwave irradiation confirmed an earlier conclusion , based on studies of the equilibrium critical current ( in the absence of external irradiation ) @xcite , that narrow channels are films which satisfy to the relation @xmath294 . for them , according to a theory @xcite the calculated values of lower boundary frequencies of superconductivity enhancement correspond to experimental values . in much wider films",
    "there appears a dependence of characteristic parameters of enhancement effect on the film width . in this connection , to describe a non - equilibrium state of wide films ( @xmath295 ) in electromagnetic fields it is necessary to develop a theory , which in contrast to the eliashberg theory @xcite initially takes into account a non - uniform current distribution and the presence of vortices of its own magnetic flux .",
    "an unexpected effect of electromagnetic field on the current @xmath103 , which can not be considered as a trivial influence of the irradiation on the @xmath21 and @xmath155 , was found @xcite .",
    "the experimental temperature dependencies of the enhanced current @xmath258 are well approximated by formulas which are similar to the formula ( 22 ) for an equilibrium case of the aslamazov ",
    "lempitsky theory @xcite , in which the critical temperature @xmath3 is replaced by the enhanced critical temperature @xmath85 .",
    "it was found that an absolute value of @xmath258 increases with the irradiation frequency , and the temperature region of enhancement of @xmath258 is extended toward lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "one more important fact is worth mentioning .",
    "references @xcite present the main results of a study of superconductivity enhanced by microwave irradiation in wide films . in those works , the equilibrium critical current in wide films reached a maximum possible value - a value of the pair - breaking current , and corresponded to the critical current of the aslamazov  lempitsky theory .",
    "a significant excess of this pair - breaking critical current obtained in the aslamazov ",
    "lempitsky theory in the absence of external fields was observed under microwave irradiation .",
    "this indicates the existence of superconductivity enhancement in wide films and the negligible effect of overheating , if it occurs , including an overheating of an electronic system in a superconductor .",
    "thus , experimental studies of films with different width showed that the effect of superconductivity enhancement by microwave irradiation is common , and occurs in both the case of uniform ( narrow films ) and non - uniform ( wide films ) distribution of the superconducting current over the film width .",
