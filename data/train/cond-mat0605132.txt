    "the extended hubbard model @xcite is the simplest hamiltonian that takes into account non - local coulomb interactions .",
    "its relevance to the description of cuprate superconductors , fullerides and materials presenting charge ordered phases ( rare - earth pnictides , vanadium oxides , manganites , magnetite , bechgaard salts ,  ) is widely recognized in the literature @xcite .    in this paper , we study the model , at half - filling in one and two dimensions , by means of the 2-pole approximation within the composite operator method ( com ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the latter , starting from the consideration that the original electrons lose their identity in presence of strong correlations , uses composite operators ( i.e. , operators built as products of the electronic ones ) to describe the effective elementary excitations of the interacting system under analysis .",
    "the non - canonical algebra satisfied by the composite operators dictates constraints ( i.e. , algebra constraints @xcite ) that are systematically used to fix the representation where the propagators are realized and self - consistently compute the unknown parameters appearing in the theory @xcite .    in the next sections , we will , first , briefly present the model and the method and , then , discuss the phase diagrams obtained by the application of the latter to the former .",
    "the rank of the transitions between homogeneous and charge ordered phases are studied together with the relation between such transitions and the paramagnetic metal - insulator one .",
    "the relevant features of the diagrams ( critical points and reentrant behavior ) are also analyzed in detail .",
    "the extended hubbard model reads as @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the chemical potential , @xmath5 is the creation electronic operator in spinorial notation , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a lattice vector of a @xmath8-dimensional square lattice , @xmath9 is the hopping integral , @xmath2 is the onsite coulomb interaction , @xmath1 is the intersite one , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the number operator for electrons of spin @xmath12 .",
    "hereafter , the hopping integral will be used as reference unit for all energies .",
    "we have used the notation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 can be any operator and @xmath15 is the projector on the first @xmath16 neighbor sites on the lattice .",

    "the spectral weights @xmath35 can be computed as @xmath36 where the matrix @xmath37 has the eigenvectors of @xmath38 as columns @xcite . for the sake of brevity , we do not report the complete expressions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which can be found in ref .",
    "the parameters appearing in the theory , and not connected to the green s function under analysis ( @xmath41 and @xmath42^\\alpha c_\\downarrow ^\\dagger ( i)c_\\uparrow ^\\dagger ( i ) \\rangle$ ] ) , will be self - consistently computed ( the first ) by calculating the density - density correlation function within the one - loop approximation @xcite and ( the second ) by means of the local algebra constraint @xcite @xmath43 .",
    "the set of self - consistent equations , fixing the parameters appearing in the theory , is highly non - linear . according to this ,",
    "it is not strange at all that it admits two distinct solutions that , hereafter , we will call com1 and com2 .",
    "the composite operator method tries to give answers in the whole space of model and physical parameters and the presence of two solutions should be seen as a richness of the method . for the one - dimensional system we will consider only com2 solution as with this",
    ", for the simple hubbard model , we got excellent agreements with the bethe ansatz exact solution @xcite .",
    "for the two - dimensional case , we will study both solutions as they will permit us to analyze two different behaviors that could be both observed experimentally .",
    "com2 solution for the one dimensional system reports a phase transition from the mott insulating phase to a inhomogeneous charge ordered state of checkerboard type for positive values of the intersite coulomb potential greater than some critical one .",
    "this result is consistent with many other studies @xcite .",
    "the nature of this phase transition is not well understood yet and currently under intense investigation @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram in the plane @xmath1-@xmath2 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 - 2 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the phase transition is of the second order up to @xmath44 ; it becomes of the first order for higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "the kind of phase transition that we are here analyzing is completely different from the one usually reported in the literature in proximity of the @xmath45 line as this latter occurs between an inhomogeneous charge ordered phase and an homogenous spin ordered phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 2 ] ( right panel ) we report the phase diagram in the plane @xmath0-@xmath1 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for @xmath46",
    "the transition is second order for all values of @xmath0 . for @xmath49 we can see a first signature of a reentrant behavior . by this latter",
    "we mean a situation in which by increasing the temperature we can first enter and then exit a phase when within another . for @xmath50 the reentrant behavior is clearly evident .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the transition is continuous if there is no reentrant behavior .",
    "when instead there is a reentrant behavior , the transition is discontinuous up to the turning point , then becomes continuous .",
    "it is worth noticing that the transition is clearly marked by a discontinuity in the nearest - neighbor density - density correlation function .",
    "com2 solution for the two - dimensional case has similar characteristics to that observed in the 1d case .",

    "the system undergoes a metal - insulator transition at some critical value of the onsite coulomb potential @xmath2 , which depends on the intensity of the intersite potential @xmath1 .",
    "with respect to the @xmath57 case ( the simple hubbard model ) , the metallic region is compressed by the presence of the intersite interaction and disappears for @xmath58 . by further increasing the intersite coulomb potential , the system undergoes a transition to a charge ordered state",
    "the complete phase diagram in the plane @xmath1-@xmath2 is shown in fig .  [ fig4 - 5 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the diagram is characterized by two critical curves , which separate the different phases .",
    "the lower one controls the mit , the upper one controls the transition to a charge ordered state .",
    "the first transition is first order for @xmath59 and second order for higher values of @xmath2 ; the second one is first order for @xmath60 and second order for lower value of @xmath2 .",
    "the phase diagram in the plane @xmath0-@xmath1 is shown in fig .  [ fig4 - 5 ] ( right panel ) . for @xmath61",
    "there is no metallic phase and we have a critical temperature where a transition from an insulating to a charge ordered state is observed .",
    "the transition is first order up to @xmath62 , then becomes continuous .",
    "a reentrant behavior is observed with the same characteristics previously discussed .",
