    "vector mesons have played a very important role in hadron physics from the early days on @xcite and were theoretically studied using model lagrangians for vector fields , or employing dispersion and/or current algebra techniques .",
    "they were sometimes also interpreted as gauge bosons of a hidden local symmetry @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive review . nowadays , a convenient tool to describe low - energy reactions and properties of hadrons is given by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , the low - energy effective field theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( see e.  g. @xcite for a recent review ) . in this framework , the pions ( and in the case of three dynamical quark flavors also the kaons and the eta meson ) are considered as the goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the latter is an exact symmetry of the qcd lagrangian when the light quark masses are set to zero and no electroweak interaction is present - a situation that was sometimes called a `` theoretical paradise '' @xcite . in the real world , the masses of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the @xmath3 - quark are nonzero , but small compared to a typical hadronic scale of @xmath4 gev , while the `` heavy '' quarks ( @xmath5 ) are not active as dynamical degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) and can be integrated out of the theory .",
    "moreover , quarks and gluons are confined inside the hadrons , so that the long - range part of the strong interaction is dominated by the goldstone boson dynamics .",
    "this situation allows an effective - field - theory treatment of the interactions among hadrons , where the light quark masses and goldstone boson momenta are treated as small quantities compared to @xmath6 .",
    "one has to write down the most general effective lagrangian consistent with chiral symmetry and all other symmetries of the underlying field theory ( qcd ) , and imposes a suitable power - counting scheme to order the perturbation series in a low - energy expansion in the small quantities ( meson momenta , quark masses etc . ) .",
    "vector mesons were included in chpt at an early stage @xcite as massive matter fields interacting with the light goldstone bosons .",
    "however , when the massive particles appear in a loop graph , it becomes non - trivial to keep the low - energy power counting manifest due to the introduction of a new `` heavy '' mass scale ( the vector meson mass in the chiral limit ) .",
    "this phenomenon was also observed when incorporating baryons in chpt on the one - loop level @xcite . to solve this problem , and to preserve the usual low - energy power counting scheme , a `` heavy vector meson theory ''",
    "was designed @xcite , while schemes preserving the power counting _ and _ manifest lorentz covariance when including vector mesons were worked out some years later @xcite .",
    "all these schemes face a problem in the resonance energy region , due to the fact that the @xmath7 vector meson is not a stable particle under the strong interaction and can decay into two light goldstone bosons ( pions ) which , by energy - momentum conservation , can not be both of `` soft '' momentum ( this problem does not occur for baryons since a decay into goldstone bosons is prohibited by baryon number conservation ) : the imaginary part of the loop diagram which generates the decay width of the vector meson does not scale as expected from the nave application of the low - energy counting rules to the diagram . in the language of the infrared regularization scheme @xcite this part should belong to the `` regular part '' of the loop integral , which is usually simply dropped in infrared regularization , with the argument that it only contains analytic terms which can be absorbed in the local operators of the effective lagrangian . in the present case ,",
    "however , it is in general complex , and contains relevant physics .",
    "this problem is discussed in @xcite . while it is argued in @xcite that the power - counting violating portion of the imaginary part can be absorbed in renormalized masses and couplings ( which then become complex ) , without spoiling perturbative unitarity ,",
    "this procedure is certainly only valid when the resonance mass is far above the decay threshold , e.g. @xmath8 . in the present contribution",
    ", we want to study the vector meson masses for three dynamical flavors , within a chiral lagrangian framework , to one - loop accuracy , using lattice data from the qcdsf collaboration @xcite .",
    "we will see that for most of the data points , the above requirement given by the inequality is not met . of course , one could object that in this case the chpt treatment is not valid any more , and some model dependence is involved in the quark mass region where the vector mesons suddenly `` become stable '' .",
    "we are aware of that matter and consider our study as an exploratory one , which , however , fully incorporates all the one - loop effects relevant for the vector meson masses , widths and mixing amplitudes . in conclusion , it seems that the usual low - energy power counting of meson chpt is not adapted to the analysis of the physics we want to investigate here .",
    "we will explain our approach to this problem in sect .",
    "[ sec : extform ] .",
    "note that the relevance of the non - analyticities due to resonance decay thresholds for chiral extrapolations was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ an alternative way of examining the properties of meson resonances , instead of explicitly including them as fields in some lagrangian , is to study a scattering process ( or form factor ) where these resonances show up , using some model scattering amplitudes which obey two - particle unitarity . for example",
    ", one can use a convenient model amplitude for @xmath9 scattering to examine the properties of the ( modelled ) @xmath7 resonance .",
    "such ideas are more than fifty years old @xcite and have been revived some time ago employing `` unitarized chpt '' in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the quark mass dependence of the @xmath7 and @xmath10 resonance masses was studied within such an approach .",
    "it would be very nice to see a consistent picture emerge when comparing the chiral lagrangian framework to such non - perturbative approaches .",
    "however , it is not clear a priori that the subset of feynman graphs that is effectively resummed in the unitarized scattering amplitudes is sufficient to generate the correct quark mass dependence of the resonance parameters .",
    "for example , when studying the quark mass dependence of the @xmath7 mass , one must take care that @xmath11 terms are included , which are nonanalytic in the quark masses and are generated by the @xmath12 sunset graphs , but not by the purely pionic loops ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we will not make use of such non - perturbative methods , and restrict ourselves to the one - loop level of perturbation theory to study the quark mass dependence of the vector meson self - energies . for some earlier studies of vector meson self - energies on the one - loop level , outside the framework of chpt , we refer to @xcite .",

    "[ tab : wtadpolesa]-[tab : wotadpolesb ] .",
    "an extension of the present calculation to a next - to - leading one - loop calculation , without assuming a large-@xmath161 scaling , meets some difficulties : first , many additional tadpole graph contributions appear , and to fix the corresonding new lecs , one would need e.g. data on @xmath259 .",
    "second , fan plot data at different values of the average quark mass @xmath106 would be needed to fix all the quark mass insertions at the fourth chiral order . moreover , at this order , one might also want to include electromagnetic contributions , and isospin breaking due to the light quark mass difference , which we have completely neglected here ( of course , these effects are also not present in the lattice data used here ) . for numerical estimates of these effects , we again refer to @xcite ( see also @xcite for the corresponding contributions to @xmath260 mixing ) . in a future study , finite - volume corrections should also be included , although these were claimed to cancel to a large extent in the mass ratios leading to the fan plots @xcite . in summary , the results of the present exploratory study , together with the results obtained on the extrapolation of baryon mass ratios in our previous work @xcite , lead us to conclude that the simulation strategy proposed and examined in @xcite , namely the extrapolation from the symmetric point ( instead of the chiral limit ) to physical quark masses is very promising , and that chiral perturbation theory can be used as a reliable tool to guide such an extrapolation , while the uncertainties for an expansion around the chiral limit are probably too large in the three - flavor case ( see also the discussion in @xcite for the case of baryon masses , and references cited therein ) . in particular , for vector mesons we have the further advantage that these particles are ( almost ) stable particles at the symmetric point , so that the widths are given by symmetry - breaking corrections calculated perturbatively , and are dominated by two - particle channels in the vicinity of this reference point . of course",
