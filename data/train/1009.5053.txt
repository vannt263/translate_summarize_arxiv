    "since donald knuth in 1971 @xcite published a set of open problems with computational flavor , the problem of generating a permutation string with the least length has attracted a great deal of attention . for the past four decades , some algorithms have been introduced for tackling this problem but still many ambiguities remain .",
    "in addition to the beauty of the problem , its applicability in the security area motivated researchers to focus on this combinatorics problem . + newey @xcite and adelman @xcite proved an upper bound ( n@xmath0 - 2n+4 ) for the length of a @xmath1-complete word . later on some other proofs",
