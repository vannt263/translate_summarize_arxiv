    "silicene takes part of an emerging category of materials called `` topological insulators '' . in these materials ,",
    "the energy gap @xmath2 between the occupied and empty states is inverted or `` twisted '' for surface or edge states basically due to a strong spin - orbit interaction @xmath6 ( namely , @xmath7 mev for silicene ) .",
    "the low energy electronic properties of a large family of topological insulators and superconductors are well described by the dirac equation @xcite , in particular , some 2d gapped dirac materials isostructural with graphene like : silicene , germanene , stannene , etc .",

    "actually , the transition in silicene is associated with a non - analytic contribution to the conductivity from the zero landau level ( zll ) topological edge or surface states , as a result of a band inversion . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the hall conductivity jumps from @xmath18 to @xmath19 at the cnp , by tuning the electric field , thus reflecting the transition the from a trivial insulator to a hall insulator at the cnp .",

    "we shall combine spin - orbit coupling and electric potential into the band gap @xmath28 , so that the explicit dependence of @xmath29 on the spin @xmath30 is masked and we can simply write @xmath31 .",
    "we also consider a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 , which is implemented through the minimal coupling @xmath32 for the momentum , where @xmath33 is the vector potential in the symmetric gauge .",
    "since @xmath34 commutes with angular momentum , in order to solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath35 , we choose energy eigenspinors [ we use polar coordinates @xmath36 @xmath37^t\\ ] ] ( @xmath38 means transpose ) which also are eigenstates of angular momentum with eigenvalue @xmath3 ( an integer ) .",

    "we have numerically solved the berry - mondragon boundary condition @xmath47 and computed the energy @xmath46 spectrum of a silicene qd of radius @xmath48 nm as a function of the gap @xmath2 for magnetic field @xmath49 t ( figure [ fig2 ] , top panel ) and @xmath50 t ( figure [ fig2 ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to angular momentum @xmath51 and valley @xmath52 . for the valley @xmath53 the results are equivalent swapping @xmath54 and the gap @xmath55 .",
    "+    as we have commented , the topological phase transition in silicene is associated with a non - analytic contribution to the conductivity from the zero landau level ( zll ) . in absence of boundary conditions",
    ", the zll corresponds to the energy @xmath56 @xcite , and the band inversion at zero gap @xmath4 entails a topological phase transition . the zll still remains in the qd ( note the straight diagonal line along the second and fourth quadrants of figure [ fig2 ] for @xmath52 ) , but boundary conditions introduce chirality , which means that positive and negative angular momentum @xmath3 states have a different behavior . for low magnetic fields , below a critical value @xmath57",
    "[ see later on eq . for a semiclassical explanation ] , there only exists a band inversion , ( that is , the ordering of the conduction and valence bands is inverted by the tunable band gap which depends on the spin - orbit coupling and the electric field ) for positive angular momentum ( @xmath58 ) zlls at @xmath4 ; all these levels are degenerate with common energy @xmath59 at valley @xmath52 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "actually , this can also be analytically checked by realizing that @xmath60 vanishes only if @xmath58 , using properties of associated laguerre polynomials . on the contrary ,",
    "negative angular momentum zlls detach more an more from the line @xmath59 as @xmath61 ( large negative electric field ) , forming an equally spaced energy band with interlevel spacing of @xmath62 ( they correspond to the energy levels labeled by negative @xmath3 s in figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in going from @xmath49 t ( figure [ fig2 ] , top panel ) to @xmath50 t ( figure [ fig2 ] , botom panel ) we find a band inversion of some negative angular momentum zlls at certain nonzero gaps @xmath63 ( corresponding to given negative electric fields ) .",
    "for the case @xmath48 nm , this band inversion starts for the zll @xmath64 at the particular critical magnetic field @xmath65 t . summing - up , for a given @xmath20 and for @xmath66",
    ", there only exists a band inversion for positive angular momentum zlls at @xmath4 .",
    "the situation changes for @xmath67 , when more and more @xmath68 zlls become conductive , @xmath69 , at a given gap @xmath70 , for increasing values of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , as it can be appreciated in figure [ fig2 ] bottom panel , for @xmath71 , the zlls @xmath64 and @xmath72 have suffered a band inversion at certain values of @xmath73 ( i.e. , at certain values of the electric potential @xmath74 ) .",
    "these states must contribute to the conductivity for these critical values of the magnetic field .",
    "let us provide a semiclassical argument that explains the aforementioned band - inversion phenomenon for negative angular momentum zlls and provides an analytical expression of the magnetic field critical values @xmath75 at which @xmath68 zlls suffer a band inversion for a given qd radius @xmath20 .",
    "massless dirac electrons in silicene make cyclotron motion with frequency @xmath76 in an external magnetic field @xmath0 , where @xmath77 is the magnetic length ( the `` radius '' of the cyclotron motion for the ground state ) .",
    "the probability of finding the electron with angular momentum @xmath3 , at a given radius @xmath78 in the lowest landau level , has a sharp peak at @xmath79 .",
    "is is clear that the corresponding circular trajectory does not fit the qd when @xmath80 ( the qd size ) .",
    "this threshold provides a critical magnetic field depending on @xmath20 and @xmath3 given by @xmath81 where we have also introduced the valley index @xmath11 for completeness .",
    "note that , as we have mentioned before , chiral symmetry is broken , which means that , for positive magnetic fields @xmath5 , only negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) angular momentum @xmath68 zlls suffer band inversion at valley @xmath52 ( resp .",
    "@xmath53 ) at certain negative ( res . positive ) values @xmath63 of the gap . for negative magnetic fields we have the complementary situation , according to the general formula .",
    "we have numerically checked the semiclassical formula for different negative angular momenta @xmath3 and qd radii @xmath20 at valley @xmath52 .",
    "the band inversion for @xmath68 zlls occurs for @xmath82 at certain negative gaps @xmath83 [ see figures [ fig2 ] ( bottom panel ) and [ fig4 ] ] . at the critical point @xmath84 , we have that the energy @xmath85 of the @xmath68 zll vanishes only for large ( negative ) electric fields , that is , @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , in order to check the prediction , we have numerically solved the boundary condition for large ( negative ) electric potentials and several values of @xmath3 and @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical results ( points ) in figure [ fig1 ] confirm the semiclassical prediction ( lines ) in eq . with high accuracy for several @xmath3 and @xmath20 .",
    "for a given qd size ( for example @xmath48 nm ) we have found out that , when the value of the magnetic field increases , there are more and more band inversions of @xmath68 zlls at certain gaps @xmath70 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) , corresponding to increasing values of @xmath87 with @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , for a given @xmath68 , @xmath63 goes to zero as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this calculation has been done by numerically solving the boundary condition for @xmath88 and valley @xmath52 .",
    "we have illustrated this result in figure [ fig4 ] for angular momentum zlls @xmath64 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and for a silicene qd of radius @xmath48 nm .",
    "we have studied the energy spectrum of a silicene qd of radius @xmath20 in the presence of perpendicular magnetic @xmath0 and electric @xmath1 fields , the last one providing a tunable band gap @xmath2 .",
    "we have established the existence of critical magnetic fields , given by the semiclassical formula @xmath92 , above which angular momentum @xmath3 zlls of a silicene qd of radius @xmath20 suffer band inversion and contribute to the conductivity .",
    "boundary conditions introduce chirality , thus distinguishing positive and negative angular momentum edge states .",
    "when sign@xmath93sign@xmath94 , all angular momentum zlls are degenerate , with energy @xmath56 , and all of them suffer a band inversion at gap @xmath4 for any value of the magnetic field . when sign@xmath95sign@xmath94 [ matching the formula for @xmath75 ] , the degeneracy is broken and a band inversion occurs at nonzero gap @xmath83 for @xmath97 . as @xmath0 increases , more and more angular momenta @xmath3 zlls suffer band inversion at gaps @xmath83 , which go to zero as @xmath0 increases",
    "we have performed our calculations in the continuous model , which is a long - wave approximation of the more fundamental tight binding model .",
    "therefore , we have disregarded the effect of lattice termination on the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that the effect of the boundary irregularities on the spectrum is negligible when the radius @xmath20 is much larger than the lattice constant , and our results on band inversion at critical magnetic fields remain valid at least in this regime . of course ,",
    "a more detailed calculation inside the tight binding framework with more realistic edge termination , like the one done in ref .",
    "@xcite for silicene in magnetic field , is necessary to account for the robustness of the band inversion phenomenon .",
    "we think that this question deserves a separate study and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "anyhow , we believe that these critical phenomena in a silicene qd can lead to interesting nanotechnological applications .",
