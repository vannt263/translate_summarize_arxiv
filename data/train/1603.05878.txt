    "the efimov effect has been predicted by v. efimov in a series of papers  @xcite and experimentally confirmed more than 35 years after its prediction  @xcite . at present",
    "there is an intense experimental activity  @xcite aiming at understanding the behavior of few - body systems close to the unitary limit in which the two - body scattering length @xmath0 diverges . around this limit",
    "the systems show universal behavior ; very different systems such as atomic or nuclear systems present similar features .",
    "the study of these characteristics is a very active field of research nowadays . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the behavior of a few - body system in the limit of large scattering length can be formulated in the framework of the renormalization group using an effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . using this language ,",
    "one of the main striking properties of three identical bosons in the unitary limit is the discrete scaling invariance ( dsi ) shown by the spectrum : an infinite series of bound states ( trimers ) appears distributed geometrically with accumulation point at zero energy .",
    "the ratio of binding energies for two consecutive states is @xmath2 , with the universal number @xmath3 .",
    "explicitly , the total angular momentum @xmath4 spectrum of three identical bosons in the zero - range limit can be described by the efimov radial law    @xmath5    [ eq : energyzr ]    the main ingredients in these equations are the universal function @xmath6 and the binding momentum @xmath7 , called the three - body parameter , defining the energy @xmath8 of level @xmath9 at the unitary limit , @xmath10 being the boson mass .",
    "dsi manifests from the fact that the function @xmath6 is the same for all @xmath11 levels .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum described by these equations is not bounded from below , this characteristic is known as the thomas collapse  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the universal function @xmath6 in the interval @xmath12 limited by the two- and three - cluster continuum can be obtained by solving the skorniakov - ter - martirosian ( stm ) equation or equivalently by using effective field theory ( eft ) as reported in ref .",
    "this equation describes the @xmath4 state of a three - boson system in the zero - range limit . to avoid the thomas collapse",
    "it is a common practice to introduce a cutoff in the solution of the stm equation and the universal function @xmath6 is computed looking at the second or even third excited state  @xcite where the cutoff effects are negligible .",
    "a parametrization of it can be found in ref .",
    "in the same way potential models can be used to solve the schrdinger equation looking at the high part of the spectrum , where finite - range effects are negligible .",
    "the extension of the zero - range theory to four bosons has been discussed in refs .",
    "the main conclusion of these works is that the four - boson spectrum presents a two - level tree structure .",
    "for each three - body level @xmath13 there are two four - body states ( tetramers ) , one deep ( @xmath14 ) and one shallow ( @xmath15 ) , with binding energies @xmath16 . the universal ratios of these binding energies in the unitary limit have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and they are @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the present work we would like to analyze the complete interval between the four - body continuum and the dimer - dimer thresholds in order to extend eq.([eq : energyzr ] ) to the four - boson system and , if possible , to determine the corresponding universal function .",
    "the present study is done using potential models with variable strength . in this way a path to reach the unitary limit is defined .",
    "it has been recently shown that a two - parameter potential captures the essential ingredients of the few - boson dynamics close to the unitary limit  @xcite . accordingly , here we define two different potentials , a local gaussian and a nonlocal gaussian used to solve the schrdinger equation along the path .",
    "for the lowest states finite - range effects are appreciable . for this case",
    "it is possible to define level functions that absorb those effects and can be used to estimate the spectrum of a real system close to the unitary limit . for higher states finite - range effects can be neglected and the solution tends to the zero - range limit therefore the level functions tend to the universal zero - range function . in order to illustrate the procedure we first analyse the two - body system and",
    "then the analysis is extended to the three- and four - boson systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii the particular path used to reach the unitary limit",
    "is studied in the two - body system . in sec .",
    "iii and iv the spectra of the three- and four - boson systems are computed using the two potential models , local and nonlocal . from the results a zero - range equation for the four - boson system",
    "is proposed .",
    "the conclusion and perspectives are given in the last section .",
    "in the two - body system the @xmath4 spectrum within the zero - range theory can be defined through the relations    @xmath19    [ eq : energy2bzr ]    the first relation establishes that there is a bound state ( @xmath20 ) or a virtual state ( @xmath21 ) with binding energy @xmath1 fixed by the scattering length @xmath0 . at positive energies , @xmath22 ,",
    "the @xmath23-wave phase - shift @xmath24 is determined by the scattering length as well .",
    "accordingly , the scattering length @xmath0 emerges as a control parameter in terms of which the observables as the cross section or mean square radius can be computed .",
    "the zero - range theory describes the extreme situation in which the two particles are always outside the interaction range .",
    "if the two - body quantum system , interacting through a short - range potential , has a shallow state , there is a big probability of finding the particles outside the interaction range .",
    "in fact , when @xmath1 is very small or , equivalently , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the interaction range , the two - body wave function has a very long tail and the two particles have a large probability of being at relative distances greater than @xmath26 .",
    "when a shallow state is present , the scattering length verifies @xmath27 too , and @xmath28 , with eq.([eq : energy2bzra ] ) approximately fulfilled .",
    "the extension of eq.([eq : energy2bzr ] ) in the case of finite - range interactions and at low energies is    @xmath29    [ eq : energy2bfr ]    with @xmath30 being the effective range . in the case of shallow states",
    "the second equation can be used to relate the effective range to @xmath31 , @xmath32 from which we obtain the relation @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the above discussion stressed the fact that in the low energy limit or large scattering length limit the dynamics of the two - body system depends on two parameters : the scattering length and the effective range @xmath30 ( or the length @xmath35 ) .",
    "the scaling limit is defined by @xmath36 whereas in the unitary limit @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the first case , for each value of @xmath0 the two - body energy is determined by the zero - range condition @xmath39 . when @xmath40 , the unitary limit can be reached by different paths determined by the functional relation @xmath41 .",
    "having in mind that we intend to study the structure of few - boson systems , we construct a two - parameter potential able to reproduce the minimal information given by one specific set of @xmath0 and @xmath31 values . then the potential strength can be varied in order to reach the unitary limit .",
    "we define local ( given in coordinate space ) and nonlocal ( given in momentum space ) gaussian potentials @xmath42 with the strengths @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the ranges @xmath26 , @xmath45 determined to describe the particular value of @xmath0 and @xmath31 of a two - boson system .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 can be varied in order to reach the unitary limit . with this procedure",
    "the functional relation @xmath41 is determined .",
    "it should be noted that with the potentials defined above the lengths , momenta and energy scale with @xmath26 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the local gaussian defines a particular path to the unitary limit that encompasses all local gaussians and the same for the nonlocal one .",
    "in particular , the values of the effective range and strength at unitary are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] for the cases in which there are @xmath11 bound states in the two - body system .",
    "note that the nonlocal potential , being rank - one separable potential , supports only one bound state at most .",
    ".universal values of the effective range ( in units of @xmath26 or @xmath45 ) and potential strength ( in units of @xmath48 or @xmath50 ) for local and nonlocal gaussians at the unitary limit for different bound state numbers @xmath11 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    in the following we consider the @xmath51 case , however the other cases can be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "we are interested in the functional relation @xmath52 as @xmath53 . defining @xmath54 the value of the effective range at the unitary limit , from eq.([eq : reff ] )",
    "we can define @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , the quantity @xmath57 can be expanded around the unitary limit as @xmath58 inserting the above expansion in eq.([eq : reffru ] ) the effective range expansion in terms of the inverse of the scattering length becomes @xmath59 if the length @xmath35 were constant along the path , the coefficient @xmath60 would be @xmath61 and @xmath62 as well as higher terms .",
    "differences from these values indicate a non constant behavior of @xmath35 .",
    "for example the study of the van der waals ( vdw ) potential shows a quadratic relation between @xmath30 and the inverse of the scattering length .",
    "explicitly it results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) @xmath63 with @xmath64",
    ". therefore the coefficients in eq.([eq : reffx ] ) are @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the case of the lg and nlg potentials",
    "the behavior is almost linear ( @xmath67 ) , with the coefficient @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the relation @xmath41 can be analyzed starting from the following definition @xmath70 defining @xmath56 and @xmath71 , and considering the expansion of @xmath57 given above , this relation , at first order in @xmath37 , results @xmath72 in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] the quantity @xmath73 is shown for different potential models around the unitary limit",
    ". the results of the different potential models collapse in the curve given by eq.([eq : unixy ] ) showing that up to first order the relation @xmath74 is well verified . in the study we have included the lm2m2 helium - helium interaction from aziz  @xcite",
    ". we can conclude that eq.([eq : unixy ] ) can be seen as a universal relation describing the path to the unitary limit fixed by the relation @xmath75 .",
    "potentials with variable strength follow this path with reasonable accuracy , however first order corrections could be of the order of a few percent for the lg potential and up to @xmath76 in the case of the nlg potential .     and @xmath0 ( in units of @xmath77 ) for the different potential models .",
    "all the computed values collapse on the curve @xmath78 . ]",
    "the analysis of the two - boson system indicates that a two - parameter potential as local or non - local gaussian can be used to study the low - energy dynamics around the unitary limit .",
    "we will extend the analysis to the three- and four - boson systems .",
    "the numerical results for the local gaussian are obtained solving the schrdinger equation in the coordinate space framework using the hyperspherical harmonic expansion  @xcite while the predictions for the non - local gaussian are obtained solving faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) @xcite or alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite using momentum - space methods from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 spectrum of three identical bosons in the zero - range limit can be described by the efimov radial law given in eq.([eq : energyzr ] ) . in the case of a system with a finite range interaction , this equation",
    "can be seen as describing the asymptotic spectrum of the three - boson system close to the unitary limit .",
    "in fact , the solution of the schrdinger equation can be used to determine the universal function @xmath6 looking at the excited states of the spectrum as , for these states , finite - range effects are negligible . in this context the description of few - body systems with potential models close to the unitary limit can be seen as a particular regularization scheme .",
    "accordingly it is possible to modify the efimov radial law as ( see refs .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath79    [ eq : energyfr3 ]    where @xmath80 is the dimer binding energy for positive values of @xmath0 whereas for negative values it is the two - body virtual state energy",
    ". modifications at the three - body level are introduced by the parameters @xmath81 who absorb the scaling factor @xmath82 defining the energy of level @xmath11 at the unitary limit , @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore the finite - range character of the interaction slightly modifies the ratio @xmath84 from its universal value of @xmath85 .",
    "the main modification in the above equations is the introduction of the level function @xmath86 . for the ground state ( @xmath51 ) it could be very different from the zero - range function @xmath6 . as we will see below the differences",
    "are much reduced considering the first excited state ( @xmath87 ) and , starting from @xmath88 , both functions almost coincide .",
    "the level function can be calculated using the corresponding solutions of the schrdinger equation as @xmath89    it should be noticed that for @xmath90 this function depends on the particular potential used to calculate the spectrum or , in the case of the stm equation , the cutoff .",
    "it depends also on the particular path selected to reach the unitary limit , for example , potentials with variable strength as discussed in the previous section . however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , following this particular path different potentials do not produce too much spread in @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore the lg potential defines a unique gaussian function @xmath86 for each level @xmath11 independent of the range , @xmath26 , of the potential .",
    "in particular , for the first two levels @xmath90 , the binding momenta at the unitary limit are @xmath93 and @xmath94 and the ratio @xmath95 .",
    "these values have been obtained with the potential acting only in @xmath23-waves , they are slightly different when the lg potential is taken to act in all waves ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . also the nlg potential acting in @xmath23-wave defines a unique nonlocal gaussian function with the following universal ratios @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . from the above discussion",
    "the following picture emerges : a two - parameter potential as the local or nonlocal gaussians can be used to construct level functions for each level @xmath11 of the three - boson system .",
    "for @xmath90 these functions are different from the zero - range universal function and are also different among themselves . for @xmath88",
    "they converge to the zero - range universal function showing a universal behavior . in order to analyze this fact quantitatively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] the level functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 are shown for the case of the lg , nlg and lm2m2 potentials .",
    "the trend discussed above is visible in the figure , for the ground state the level functions @xmath91 spread in a narrow band and are rotated with respect to the universal function @xmath6 , given by the red solid curve  @xcite . in the case of the first excited state",
    "the level functions @xmath92 spread also in a very narrow band very close to @xmath6 .",
    "the level function @xmath99 calculated using the nlg third excited state ( red diamonds ) completely overlaps with the zero - range universal function .     for different levels and potentials .",
    "the zero - range universal function @xmath6 is shown as the red solid curve . ]",
    "the efimov radial law is a one - parameter equation .",
    "the knowledge of the universal function @xmath6 allows for a complete determination of the spectrum after assigning a value to @xmath7 ( or to one of the energies @xmath13 ) .",
    "eq.([eq : energyfr3 ] ) applies mostly to @xmath90 and works slightly differently . in first place",
    "it is necessary to calculate the level functions for the ground and first excited state .",
    "this can be done using for example the lg or nlg potentials . at this point",
    "the equation is a one - parameter equation and the @xmath51 and @xmath87 spectrum can be completely determined from the knowledge of one energy .",
    "one can argue that if we use eq.([eq : energyfr3 ] ) to describe a particular system , the respective potential could be used to compute the level function @xmath91 or @xmath92 by varying the strength in order to reach the unitary limit .",
    "however , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , close to the unitary limit the three - boson system has universal behavior and therefore a two - parameter potential captures the essential ingredients of the dynamics absorbing finite range effects . as an example we can use @xmath100 computed using the lg or nlg potentials to estimate the three - body parameter @xmath101 of a system composed by three @xmath102he atoms . as given in ref .",
    "@xcite the result using the lg potential is @xmath103a@xmath104 ( a@xmath105    is the bohr radius ) . using the nlg",

    "<S> two- , three- , and four - boson systems are studied close to the unitary limit using potential models constructed to reproduce the minimal information given by the two - body scattering length @xmath0 and the two - body binding energy or virtual state energy @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the particular path used to reach the unitary limit is given by varying the potential strength . in this way the energy spectrum in the three- and four - boson systems is computed . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy states show finite - range effects absorbed in the construction of level functions that can be used to study real systems . </S>",
    "<S> higher energy levels are free from finite - range effects , therefore the corresponding level functions tend to the zero - range universal function . using this property a zero - range equation for the four - boson system </S>",
    "<S> is proposed and the four - boson universal function is computed . </S>"
