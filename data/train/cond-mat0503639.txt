    "this nonequilibrium transition displays universal critical behavior as in equilibrium _ continuous _ transitions , with the medium s mean velocity @xmath1 acting as an order parameter @xcite . in overdamped elastic media ,",
    "the sliding state is unique and no hysteresis can occur @xcite .",
    "the elastic medium model is often inadequate to describe real physical systems that exhibit plastic response on various scales .",
    "plasticity , used here in a loose sense , may arise in systems with an underlying periodic structure , such as vortex lattices or charge density waves , for strong disorder .",
    "this yields large deformations of the driven medium with the proliferation of topological defects , which are continuously generated and healed by the interplay of drive , disorder and interactions.@xcite in other situations , such as crack propagation in heterogeneous solids@xcite , and the motion of a helium-4 droplet contact line on a rough surface @xcite , the dissipative elastic medium model is made inadequate by the presence of inertial effects or other nonlocal stress propagation mechanisms . in both cases",
    "the depinning transition may become discontinuous and sometime hysteretic .",
    "several coarse - grained models of driven extended systems that can lead to history - dependent dynamics have been proposed in the literature . here",
    "we examine two classes of such models . in the first class of models the displacement of",
    "the driven medium from some undeformed reference configuration remains single - valued , as appropriate for systems without topological defects , but the elastic interactions are modified by assuming local underdamped dynamics .",
    "this is modeled via a linear stress - strain relation , where the stress transfer between displacements of different parts of the manifold is nonmonotonic in time .",
    "models of this type have been used to incorporate the effect of inertia or elastic stress overshoot in crack propagation in solids @xcite .",
    "a related model was proposed by the author and collaborators as an _ effective _ description of topological defects in the driven system @xcite .",
    "below we show that the presence of topological defects in a solid can be described as a viscous force that allows a moving portion of the medium to overshoot a static configuration before relaxing back to it , so that these two models are identical . in the second class of models topological defects",
    "are explicitly allowed by removing the constrain that displacements are single - valued .",
    "we consider a simple realization of this type of models proposed some time ago in the context of charge density waves , where the scalar displacement describes the phase of the electronic condensate and the system only exhibits one - dimensional periodicity along the direction of motion .",
    "it is obtained by assuming a nonlinear coupling among neighboring displacements that incorporates the crucial feature that the displacement becomes undefined at the location where the amplitude of the order parameter collapses .",
    "this is incorporated in the model as an instantaneous jump of the displacement or phase of an amount equal to its period , knows as phase slip .",
    "the two classes of models exhibit remarkably similar behavior in the mean - field limit , where the interaction are assumed to have infinite range . as a function of disorder strength",

    "depinning is continuous at weak disorder with mean - field critical exponents that are identical to those obtained for a dissipative elastic medium . above a critical disordered strength ,",

    "the origin of the hysteresis is , however , different in the two models , as discussed below .",
    "preliminary numerical work also suggests that differences may arise in finite dimensions .",

    "the microscopic dynamics is always assumed to be overdamped , but velocity - dependent couplings can arise upon coarse - graining .",
    "the equation of motion in the laboratory frame is written by balancing all the forces acting on each segment of the driven medium as @xcite @xmath6 where time has been scaled so that the friction coefficient is unity , @xmath7 is the external driving force , @xmath8 is the pinning force , and @xmath9 represents the stresses due to interactions with the neighbors .",

    "the resulting phase diagram for a piecewise parabolic pinning potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_pd ] .",
    "we see immediately that this is richer than the phase diagram for the ve model , as now both disorder - driven transitions between static coherent and incoherent phases as well as force - driven transitions between static and moving phases can occur .",
    "although , as shown in @xcite , the detailed shape of the phase boundaries depends on the specific form of the pinning potential in mean field , the types of phases and the schematic topology of the phase diagram are general . at low driving forces both coherent ( cs ) and incoherent ( is ) static phases are stable .",
    "= 5.5 cm    = 5.5 cm    the transition from the coherent phase at weak disorder to the incoherent phase at strong disorder is discontinuous for piecewise parabolic pinning .",
    "it also becomes hysteretic for most other pinning potentials.@xcite when the driving force is ramped up adiabatically from the coherent state , the system depins continuously at @xmath115 to a unique sliding state and the coherence grows smoothly towards unity .",
    "when the force is ramped up from the incoherent static state , where @xmath109 , the system depins discontinuously at @xmath116 , with @xmath117 the single particle threshold , given by the maximum pinning force .",

    "the hysteresis may indeed be an artifact of the mean field approximation that yields a sharp distinction between coherent and incoherent static states .",
    "in finite dimension this may be replaced by a smooth growth of local coherence over a broad range of length scales , without discontinuous jumps .",
    "the mean - field tricritical point may then become a strong crossover between continuous depinning transitions characterized by ( nonuniversal ) exponents @xmath119 at weak disorder to @xmath120 at strong disorder @xcite .",
    "hysteresis seems more robust in the ve model , or in general in models with local inertia .",
    "preliminary numerical simulations of an anisotropic version of the ve models in two dimensions indicate a stubborn persistence of hysteresis with increasing system size even for relatively weak disorder . in this case",
    "the existence of hysteresis may not be a good test of the precise nature of the depinning transition @xcite .",
    "once local inertia or topological defects are introduced in the model , various depinning scenarios are possible",
    ". the depinning may be discontinuous with hysteresis ( like an equilibrium first order phase transition ) or with hysteresis that vanishes in the infinite system limit .",
    "another possibility is that the transition in continuous and critical , in the sense that it is possible to identify diverging correlation lengths as the depinning threshold is approached adiabatically from above or from below . finally ,",
    "as originally suggested by ramanathan and fisher @xcite and more recently explored by maimon and schwarz @xcite , even critical behavior with hysteresis that survives in the infinite system limit is possible . sorting out this various scenarios for the models discussed will require more extensive numerical studies in finite dimensions .",
