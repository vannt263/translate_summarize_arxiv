    "adiabaticity is an essential and ubiquitous concept in quantum dynamics . in the current era of many novel non - equilibrium experimental possibilities , _ deviations _ from adiabaticity in slow parameter changes",
    "have attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "the question of non - adiabaticity is of fundamental interest , but also has practical implications .",
    "many experimental protocols involve adiabatically changing a parameter in order to reach a desired quantum state .",
    "since non - adiabatic heating can rarely be completely avoided , it is essential to understand deviations from adiabaticity in slow ramps .",
    "while the effect of quantum critical points in the ramp path has been considered in much detail @xcite , settings for non - equilibrium experiments in isolated systems tend to be mesoscopic rather than macroscopic , without true quantum critical points .",
    "understanding non - adiabatic ramps in _",
    "finite _ quantum systems is therefore vital .",
    "also , since cold atoms dominate experimental non - equilibrium studies , a harmonically trapped many - particle system is the most important paradigm today for studying quenches and ramps",
    ". a few studies of ramps in finite and trapped systems have appeared in the very recent literature @xcite , indicating an emerging recognition of the importance of the adiabaticity issue in finite systems . in addition , in the past couple of years , reports of experimental investigations of finite - rate interaction ramps have started to appear , both in the continuum @xcite and in optical - lattices @xcite , with harmonically trapped atoms .    in this work ,",
    "we consider non - adiabatic ramps in several _ distinct _ interacting many - particle systems , confined in isotropic harmonic traps . in each case",
    ", we consider ramps of the interaction from an initial value @xmath0 to a final value @xmath1 , occurring in time scale @xmath2 .",
    "we focus on large but finite @xmath2 ( near - adiabatic ramps ) .",
    "we study deviations from adiabaticity through the heating @xmath3 , which is the final energy at time @xmath4 minus the ground state energy of the final hamiltonian .",
    "this quantity is also called the residual energy or excess excitation energy @xcite , and may be thought of as the `` friction '' due to imperfect adiabaticity @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath5 is a quantitative characterization of minimal corrections to adiabaticity .",
    "@xcite reports measurements of excess energies after ramps , which may be regarded as the first experimental approach to this quantity .",
    "we find that the asymptotics of @xmath5 is common to all the compressible systems that we considered .",
    "the @xmath5 function has overall power - law decay , @xmath6 , with the exponent @xmath7 depending on the shape of the ramp .",
    "for certain ramp shapes , @xmath5 has oscillations superposed on top of the power - law decay .",
    "we present results for a range of systems , interactions , and dimensionalities , which make clear that the universal features are independent of system details and generally do not depend on the initial and final values of the interaction , as long as the trapped system remains in the same phase .",
    "since the effects are universal over a wide range of trapped systems , they should be due to some type of dynamics that is prevalent in many harmonically trapped systems .",
    "we show that the relevant dynamics is the size oscillation or breathing - mode oscillation of the trapped cloud .",
    "almost all trapped systems have `` soft '' breathing modes due to vanishing density at the edge , irrespective of the nature of intrinsic modes of the system .",
    "our results show that , in the slow ramp limit , the breathing modes due to trapping dominate the near - adiabatic response of many systems . to show that the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath5 are due to size dynamics",
    ", we will use a variational description for one of the systems ( the bose condensate ) , treating the extent ( radius ) of the many - particle cloud as a time - dependent variational parameter .",
    "such a `` radius dynamics '' description will be shown to reproduce the universal @xmath5 behaviors in thorough detail .",
    "an equivalent formulation is not easy to set up for all the systems ; nevertheless , the commonality of the @xmath5 features , and the success of the radius description for at least one case , is convincing argument that the same dynamics type is the relevant feature in each case .",
    "trapped atoms are by far the most promising setup for experimentally exploring isolated - system dynamics in general and non - adiabaticiy issues in particular . a universal excitation mechanism that is dominant in generic trapped systems is thus an important baseline perspective for understanding the many further non - adiabatic ramp experiments expected in the near future .",
    "contemporary theoretical treatments of non - adiabaticity in many - particle systems almost invariably appeal to cold - atom experiments for motivation . yet",
    ", our results show that in a real trapped - atom experiment , radius dynamics dominates over the intrinsic heating mechanisms that may be important in individual uniform systems .",
    "in other words , the power - laws and many other results that have become available in the literature for @xmath5 for uniform systems ( e.g. , refs .",

    "we employed imaginary time evolution to find the initial ground state , and then runge - kutta ( with adaptive timestep size ) to evolve the coupled equations for @xmath140 in real time with changing @xmath141 .",

    "the imaginary part in the wave function is necessary because time evolution from a real wave function produces an imaginary component .",
    "however , the two parameters turn out to be not independent but simply related ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "there is thus effectively a single dynamical parameter describing the system , namely the cloud radius @xmath25 .",

    "the time - dependent dft formulation has been used successfully for the unitary fermi gas ( reviewed in ref .",
    "we do not consider the unitary limit in this work because the interaction is fixed at infinity and thus can not be ramped as a time - dependent parameter .",
    "we focus on weakly interacting gases so that we can use the relatively simple hartree approximation and the interaction @xmath141 appears explicitly and can be ramped . in this work",
    "we have restricted ourselves to 3d and to equal populations of the two components .    using the hartree approximation for the chemical potential ( main text eq .  ) , the hydrodynamic equation becomes @xmath149\\psi\\ ] ] with @xmath150 , and @xmath32 here is the total density of the two spin states .",

    "in contrast to the bose condensate case , it is not consistent to normalize @xmath153 to unity .",
    "this means that there are no factors of @xmath24 absorbed in the definition of @xmath22 in the continuum fermionic system , as opposed to the continuum bose condensate .",
    "this difference is responsible for the rather different ranges of values for the @xmath141 of becs in figure [ fig_heatcurves](d ) and the @xmath141 of the 3d fermi gas in figure [ fig_heatcurves](e ) .    as in the bose condensate case",
