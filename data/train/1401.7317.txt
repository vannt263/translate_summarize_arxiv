    "current understanding of physics at the fundamental level is based on two distinct theories : general relativity ( gr ) and the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "it is commonly believed that these two theories arise as the low - energy limit of an underlying planck - scale framework that consistently merges gravity and quantum mechanics . since direct measurements at this scale",
    "are presently impractical , experimental research in this field relies largely on ultrahigh - precision searches for planck - suppressed effects at attainable energies .",
    "one possible effect in this context is a minute breakdown of lorentz invariance .",
    "lorentz symmetry is a fundamental feature of both gr and the sm , so that any observed deviation from this symmetry would imply new physics .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches to physics beyond the sm , such as strings  @xcite , noncommutative field theories  @xcite , cosmologically varying scalar fields  @xcite , quantum gravity  @xcite , random - dynamics models  @xcite , multiverses  @xcite , brane - world scenarios  @xcite , and massive gravity  @xcite , are believed to allow for small violations of lorentz invariance at low energies .",
    "searches for such violations are also motivated by the apparent fundamental character of lorentz symmetry .",
    "consequently , lorentz invariance ought to be supported as firmly as possible by experimental evidence .",
    "it is natural to expect that lorentz - violating effects can be described within effective field theory , at least at currently attainable energies  @xcite .",
    "the framework generally adopted in this context is the standard - model extension ( sme )  @xcite , which contains both gr and the sm as limiting cases .",
    "the additional lagrangian terms present in the sme include all operators for lorentz violation that are scalars under coordinate changes .",
    "the sme has constituted the basis for the analysis of numerous experimental searches for lorentz breakdown  @xcite .    paralleling the conventional lorentz - symmetric case ,",
    "perturbative quantum - field analyses within the sme also rely on a few key theoretical concepts .",
    "some of these , such as canonical quantization  @xcite and renormalization  @xcite , have previously been studied and generalized to the sme .",
    "another such core concept concerns the treatment of external states .",
    "they span the asymptotic hilbert space , so their determination is of fundamental importance for perturbation theory .",
    "for example , explicit s - matrix calculations require a separate , independent determination of the external legs up to the desired order .",
    "this special status of external - leg physics is highlighted by the usual feynman rules : external - leg corrections can not be incorporated into the diagram for a scattering process ; the rules for s - matrix calculations specifically call for  amputed \" diagrams .",
    "the usual treatment of radiative corrections to external legs involves sophisticated theoretical concepts like the klln ",
    "lehmann representation  @xcite and the lehmann ",
    "symanzik  zimmermann ( lsz ) reduction formalism  @xcite .",
    "although a number of prior investigations have considered radiative corrections from various other perspectives  @xcite , we are unaware of any dedicated study to generalize the lorentz - invariant external - leg treatment to lorentz - violating field theories .",
    "a second need for a proper understanding of the asymptotic hilbert space in the presence of lorentz breakdown derives from its phenomenological importance : external - state effects govern the physics of free particles and are therefore also crucial for numerous lorentz tests .",
    "examples include various kinematical threshold effects in cosmic rays  @xcite , photon birefringence and dispersion  @xcite , collider kinematics and interferometry  @xcite , and neutrino propagation  @xcite . paralleling the conventional lorentz - symmetric case ,",
    "all previous analyses have been performed under the tacit assumption that the physics of free particles is determined by the quadratic pieces of the corresponding lagrangian @xcite .",
    "however , this approach disregards the self - interactions of the particle , although such effects are always present , even for asymptotic states .",
    "consequently , they need to be considered , e.g. , in any scattering process beyond tree level . in a conventional renormalizable quantum field theory ( qft )",
    ", lorentz symmetry implies that the quadratic lagrangian can only acquire a mass shift and a field - strength factor , both of which can be treated by renormalization of existing quantities .",
    "the external qft legs are then identical in structure to the quadratic - lagrangian solutions , which therefore indeed describe the propagation of free particles correctly .",
    "a nonperturbative rigorous justification for this feature is given by the aforementioned lsz reduction formalism  @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of lorentz violation a similar line of reasoning fails , and the question regarding the determination of free - particle properties arises .    the present work is intended to initiate a theoretical investigation of these issues . in particular , we demonstrate that in the absence of lorentz symmetry the external legs in perturbative quantum field theory exhibit a different structure than the plane - wave solutions arising from the quadratic lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "this result is in accordance with a recent work  @xcite in which a generalization of the klln  lehmann representation for the propagator was derived for a field - theoretic model with fermions that are coupled to the same lorentz - violating sme coefficients as the ones we are considering in this work .",
    "in fact , we will use the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite to extract consistently the one - particle poles at first order in lorentz violation .",
    "these poles define the external states of scattering amplitudes . to this end",
    ", we generalize the conventional lsz reduction formula to include lorentz - breaking sme corrections at linear order .    for this analysis , we restrict ourselves to a subset of the minimal sme s electrodynamics sector for simplicity .",
    "moreover , we are primarily focused on effects that may potentially be of phenomenological relevance and affect the usual perturbative expansion of quantum field theory .",
    "our analysis is therefore performed at first order in sme coefficients , an approach justified on observational grounds .",
    "a future nonperturbative treatment of these issues within formal field theory would be interesting , but lies outside our present scope . throughout",

    "our summary and an outlook are contained in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "supplemental material is collected in various appendixes .",
    "our model is based on the bare gauge - invariant flat - spacetime lagrange density for single - flavor quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) within the minimal sme : @xmath2 the label @xmath3 denotes bare quantities , @xmath4 is a dirac spinor and @xmath5 a gauge - field strength .",
    "we have also implemented the conventional notation for the u(1)-covariant derivative @xmath6 and for the dual field - strength tensor @xmath7 .",
    "the lorentz - violating effects are contained in the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 as well as in the generalized gamma matrices @xmath10 and the generalized mass matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the latter are given by the explicit expressions @xmath12 the nondynamical spacetime constant quantities @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 control the type and extent of lorentz and cpt breakdown .",
    "it has been shown that this flat - spacetime lagrangian is multiplicatively renormalizable at one - loop order  @xcite and that this renormalizability property is maintained in curved spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "the complete one - loop structure of lagrangian  ( [ bare - lagrangian - msme ] ) would be of interest , but lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our present goal is rather to initiate the study of finite radiative corrections in the presence of lorentz violation by highlighting several theoretical issues that can arise within this context . for such illustrative purposes",
    ", it seems appropriate to simplify the model  ( [ bare - lagrangian - msme ] ) such that tractability , phenomenological importance , and theoretical relevance are optimized .",
    "considerations along these lines are presented next .",
    "a key simplification is setting to zero all lorentz - violating coefficients , with the exception of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we may also take the @xmath23 coefficient to be symmetric because its antisymmetric piece can be removed from the lagrangian by a field redefinition at leading order  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will choose @xmath24 to be of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is taken as symmetric , traceless , and given by @xmath27 we remark that the above choice of lorentz - violating couplings is compatible with the structure of the renormalization constants , as will become apparent below .",
    "in particular , no additional operators are needed to absorb ultraviolet divergences in the perturbative quantum - field expansion of the model .",
    "the above choice of sme coefficients also requires a number of additional considerations , which we present next .",
    "first , we note that eqs .",
    "( [ special - k_f ] ) and ( [ ktilde ] ) are incompatible in spacetime dimensions @xmath28 .",
    "when dimensional regularization is employed , it might then appear that this could lead to interpretational difficulties with previously determined @xmath29 and @xmath23 counterterms  @xcite in the context of minimal subtraction , affect finite radiative corrections , or may even be associated with trace anomalies .",
    "however , it turns out that such spurious issues can be avoided altogether by considering a model with @xmath26 in its own right rather than as the limit of the full @xmath29 lagrangian . throughout this work",
    ", we follow this latter , independent interpretation of our model .",
    "second , the identification of observables in lorentz - violating field theories requires special care due various types field redefinitions and reinterpretions  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "it turns out that the @xmath30 and @xmath31 coefficients are observationally indistinguishable at leading order in any fermion  photon system ; only their difference @xmath32 can be measured within the context of lagrangian  ( [ bare - lagrangian - msme ] ) .",
    "this feature has previously been discussed from various perspectives  @xcite .",
    "for example , suitable coordinate rescalings can eliminate the @xmath30 coefficient in favor of @xmath31 , or vice versa .",
    "such coordinate redefinitions can be exploited to simplify calculations . in what follows , however",
    ", we will for the most part avoid the choice of a particular coordinate scaling by keeping both @xmath30 and @xmath31 nonzero .",
    "this will provide an independent partial test of our results , since coordinate - scalar expressions for physically observable radiative effects should only depend on @xmath32 .",
    "third , we also note that various experimental investigations have sought to constrain @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , measurements have been performed in the context of resonance cavities  @xcite , kinematical threshold studies at colliders  @xcite , synchrotron radiation  @xcite , compton - edge investigations in electron ",
    "photon scattering  @xcite , and astrophysical observations  @xcite . through these investigations ,",
    "all components of @xmath32 are currently obeying bounds at the levels of @xmath33 . at present",
    ", @xmath32 nevertheless remains the parameter combination in lagrangian  ( [ bare - lagrangian - msme ] ) with the weakest experimental limits providing additional phenomenological justification for dropping the other sme coefficients from our analysis .",
    "we finally mention that further constraints on @xmath32 may , for example , also be determined with spectroscopic studies of hydrogen  @xcite and ultrahigh - energy photon - shower measurements  @xcite .    paralleling the conventional case , perturbative calculations within the present model",
    "are conveniently performed by fixing a gauge and allowing for the need to regularize infrared divergences . for the general description of massive lorentz - violating photons ,",
    "a modified stueckelberg procedure has recently been developed  @xcite .",
    "it essentially consists of amending any lorentz - violating qed lagrange density by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes a gauge parameter and @xmath36 parametrizes the gap in the photon dispersion relation .",
    "the tensorial structure @xmath37 can involve small , but otherwise arbitrary lorentz - breaking contributions @xmath38 .",
    "note that both the @xmath35 and the @xmath36 term need to contain the _ same _ tensor @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath40 in the present context needs to be compatible with the specific purpose of the @xmath36 term as a regulator : no lorentz violation in addition to @xmath41 and @xmath42 should be introduced .",
    "one obvious possibility would be the lorentz - symmetric choice @xmath43 .",
    "another possibility is to match the lorentz - violating structure of the effective kinetic term of the photon . at leading order in @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ", this kinetic term depends on the combination @xmath44 .",
    "if radiative corrections are included , the @xmath21 coefficient may also appear , but only in the combination @xmath45 , as discussed above .",
    "these considerations suggest the following choice for @xmath38 : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is a free multiplicative coefficient that may for example be chosen to match the radiative corrections to free - photon propagation . in the present work , it will be convenient to select the choice  ( [ delta_eta ] ) .",
    "since our primary focus is the fermion two - point function , we will set @xmath48 .",

    "( an actual perturbative calculation of this function will have to wait until the next section . ) to set up perturbation theory for calculating the radiative corrections to the two - point function we have to make a suitable choice of a zeroth - order system with known solutions , such that the remaining piece can be considered a small perturbation relative to this zeroth - order system . while usually one takes as the zeroth - order system the full quadratic part of the action , in the case at hand there are at least two reasonable choices one might consider .",
    "in the first scheme , one defines as a basis the renormalized quadratic lagrangian of the conventional lorentz - symmetric case .",
    "all lorentz - violating contributions to the lagrangian are then taken as perturbations .",

    "the dispersion relation of the incoming momentum remains lorentz symmetric , but the @xmath42 propagator modifies the internal kinematics of the self - energy diagram . in particular , the internal photon and fermion lines can now go on - shell simultaneously for physical incoming momenta in certain regimes .",
    "this is evident from the well - established result  @xcite that photons that are slowed down by certain values of @xmath42 lead to vacuum cherenkov radiation at ultrahigh energies : a real free fermion can now emit a real photon .",
    "the nonzero cross section for this effect is then directly related to imaginary contributions to the fermion self - energy via the optical theorem .",

    "we have limited our present study primarily to theoretical techniques for determining quantum corrections to external states in lorentz - violating backgrounds .",

    "nevertheless , the model discussed in this work could still exhibit other observables , such as ones involving the one - loop eigenspinors , in which the lorentz - breaking correction dominates the tree - level effects . in the context of more general models involving the parity - odd weak interaction ,",
    "the radiatively induced terms are likely to display a greater variety of structures since they do not necessarily have to share the same c , p , and t properties of the tree - level lorentz violation .",
