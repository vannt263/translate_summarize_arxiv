    "in order to model hard scattering processes and fragmentation , we use the pythia event generator @xcite .",

    "we compare the invariant @xmath0 spectra for pions produced running pythia with its standard settings with the recently measured phenix @xmath13 data @xcite . for our studies here we are only interested that the shape of the pythia spectra is similar to the data , so the pythia spectrum is normalized to match the real data at @xmath14 gev / c .",
    "as seen , the pythia event generator with default settings does a reasonable job in describing the measured rhic data between 4 and 8 gev / c .",
    "data and pythia .",
    "the pythia spectrum is arbitrarily normalized.,width=302 ]    our main goal in this paper is to investigate azimuthal correlations among high @xmath0 hadrons . in figure [ c2decay ]",
    "we compare the azimuthal correlations measured by the star collaboration @xcite to those produced by the pythia event generator .",
    "the pythia calculations use identical kinematic cuts as the star collaboration ( pseudorapidity @xmath15 ) .",
    "events with a high @xmath0 trigger hadron with @xmath16 gev / c are found .",
    "we then calculate the azimuthal separation of other hadrons in these events with @xmath17 gev / c .",
    "the resulting azimuthal distribution is normalized to the number of trigger hadrons . in both the star data and the pythia calculations",
    "there are strong azimuthal correlations near @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the correlated back - to - back hadrons arise from the fragmentation of back - to - back dijets .",
    "the correlated small - angle pairs can be produced via two mechanisms . during jet fragmentation , the produced hadrons will be collimated thereby producing azimuthally correlated particle pairs .",
    "such correlated pairs , however , can also be the result of the decay of resonances . in figure [ c2decay ]",
    "we investigate the role of resonance decays in the pythia calculations . within this model , stable hadrons ( @xmath20 )",
    "are produced directly during string fragmentation and also during the decay of unstable resonances produced during string fragmentation . in figure [ c2decay ]",
    "we show two different pythia calculations .",
    "the standard pythia setting includes decay of unstable resonances and we see a strong near - angle and back - to - back correlation peak .",
    "we also ran pythia in a mode where no resonances produced during fragmentation were allowed to decay . in this mode near - angle and back - to - back correlations",
    "are also observed .",
    "these correlations , however , are greatly suppressed .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the suppression factor is identical for the near - angle and back - to - back hadron pairs . since the back - to - back hadron pairs can not arise from low mass resonance decay (",
    "the invariant mass of the parent would need to be greater than 5 gev ) we conclude that the near - angle correlations observed in pythia arise primarily from the jet fragmentation and are not due to resonance decay . turning on the resonance decays leads to the observation of more charged hadrons per event and hence increases the strength of the near - angle and back - to - back azimuthal correlations .",
    "analogously , if we were to include @xmath21 in the construction of the azimuthal distribution , we would see a _ trivial _",
    "50% increase in the near - angle and back - to - back correlation strength .",
    "the increase of the azimuthal distributions is due primarily to the observation of the extra hadrons from resonance decay and not from the correlations induced by these decays .",
    "it should be noted that the absolute per - trigger yield of associated particles differs between pythia and the star data . in the case of pythia with decays ,",
    "the per - trigger yield of associated particles is larger for pythia compared to the star data . in the case of pythia without decays , the per - trigger yield of associated particles is smaller than the star data .",
    "no attempt was made to adjust the pythia fragmentation settings to rectify this difference .",
    "these azimuthal distributions are normalized to the number of  trigger hadrons \" , and these mostly arise from the case where the leading hadron carries a large fraction of the parton momentum .",
    "this is the region where the experimental data on parton fragmentation functions is most uncertain , and pythia fragmentation functions are tuned to experimental data .",
    "thus any discrepancy between measured dihadron correlation data and the pythia calculations is not of fundamental concern .",
    "the hadronic rescattering model @xcite that we will use to understand high @xmath0 hadron propagation in a dense hadronic medium has been described elsewhere and was shown to reproduce many of the low @xmath0 experimental observables at rhic including transverse momentum distributions for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the hanbury - brown twiss radii@xcite .",
    "we briefly review some of the features of the model below .",
    "rescattering is simulated with a semi - classical monte carlo calculation which assumes strong binary collisions between isospin - averaged hadrons .",
    "relativistic kinematics is used throughout .",
    "all calculations are made to simulate rhic - energy au+au collisions in order to compare with the results of rhic data .",
    "the initial stage of the rescattering calculation employs simple parameterizations to describe the initial momenta and space - time of the hadrons .",
    "the initial momenta are assumed to follow a thermal - like transverse momentum distribution for all particles , @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a `` temperature parameter '' , and a gaussian rapidity distribution for mesons , @xmath26}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the rapidity width .",
    "two rapidity distributions for baryons have been tried : 1 ) flat and then falling off near beam rapidity and 2 ) peaked at central rapidity and falling off until beam rapidity .",
    "both baryon distributions give about the same results . the initial longitudinal particle hadronization position ( @xmath28 ) and time ( @xmath29 )",
    "are determined by the relativistic equations , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the hadronization proper time . from equations 2 and 3",
    ", it is seen that longitudinal invariance is _ not _ assumed in the initial conditions for the present calculations .",
    "calculations were carried out using isospin - summed events containing at freeze - out about 5000 pions , 500 kaons , and 650 nucleons ( @xmath32 s were decayed ) .",
    "the hadronization model parameters which were found to reproduce the rhic data were @xmath33 mev , @xmath27=2.4 , and @xmath31=1 fm / c .",
    "we now compare rhic high @xmath0 data to calculations from the pure rescattering model .",
    "in other words , for these calculations hard scattering and fragmentation is not implemented . in figure [ rescattspectra ] we compare the phenix @xmath34 data to the pure rescattering model calculations for au+au collisions with impact parameter @xmath35 fm . for high @xmath0 @xmath21 production at rhic ,",
    "the spectral shape is similar in central au+au and p+p collisions .",
    "we are only interested in spectral shapes , so the rescattering model calculations are arbitrarily normalized to the phenix data at @xmath14 gev / c ( the integral of the @xmath0 spectra and hence the total yield is used to adjust the initial conditions of the calculation ) .",
    "we see that the rescattering model produces copious high @xmath0 hadrons and exhibits a power law behavior .",
    "the rescattering model over - predicts the yield of high @xmath0 hadrons .",
    "this is probably due to the treatment of the densest stage of the collision in terms of @xmath36 binary hadronic collisions whereas a more correct treatment would model this stage using many - body collision dynamics .",
    "it has been verified numerically that this approximation does not affect the bulk dynamics of the collision @xcite as measured by low @xmath0 observables .",
    "data and a pure rescattering model calculation for au+au collisions with b=4 fm .",
    "the rescattering model spectra is arbitrarily normalized.,width=302 ]    the pure rescattering model calculations also show near - angle ( but not back - to - back ) azimuthal correlations .",
    "figure [ c2rescatt ] compares the measured azimuthal distributions for p+p collisions @xcite and the azimuthal correlations produced in the rescattering model calculation for @xmath37 at @xmath35 fm .",
    "the near - angle correlations in the rescattering model come from the decay of resonances .",
    "we have confirmed this by considering rescattering particles that do not come directly from a resonance decay , in which case no azimuthal correlations are observed .",
    "these correlations are both stronger and broader than those measured in the p+p data .",
    "we have fit the rescattering model near - angle azimuthal distribution with a gaussian and get a width of @xmath38 .",
    "in contrast star has measured the widths of the near - angle azimuthal correlation in p+p , d+au , and central au+au collisions and gets a width in all cases of @xmath39 for these kinematic cuts .",
    "the large discrepancy in the widths of these correlations indicates a fundamentally different origin . in the rescattering model ,",
    "the correlations come from resonance decay , whereas for the rhic data the correlations seem to arise primarily from jet fragmentation .",
    "the near - angle azimuthal correlation strength is related to the yield of resonances at @xmath40 .",
    "the fact that the pure rescattering model produces an invariant @xmath0 spectrum of hadrons and resonances that is harder than that measured in the data leads to a somewhat artificial increase in the near - angle correlation strength .",
    "this model is certainly incorrect for calculating moderate to high @xmath0 particle production in au+au collision at rhic , so we chose to make no attempt to correct the model for its possible shortcomings .",
    "the rescattering model will only be used as a rough estimate of the environment that a jet fragmentation product would see if it was able to fragment inside such a dense hadronic medium .",
    "nonetheless , we note that this pure rescattering model does produce azimuthal correlated particle pairs due to resonance decay , and that these correlations are broader and stronger than those seen in the real data .",

    "the blue line shows a gaussian fit to the azimuthal distribution from the rescattering model.,width=302 ]",
    "pythia events are embedded into these rescattering events , with the production vertices chosen to account for the initial nuclear overlap geometry .",
    "the embedded pythia events are required to have a high @xmath0 hadron with @xmath41 3 gev / c .",
    "the particles coming from these pythia events are tagged as such , and any resonance produced via the interaction of a pythia particle is tagged as a  pythia resonance \" .",
    "the decay products of these pythia resonances are tagged as pythia particles , and in the plots that follow we only look at the final - state pythia particles .",
    "thus , the artificially large high @xmath0 particle production seen in the pure rescattering model does not invalidate our subsequent calculations .",
    "the main theoretical uncertainty in these studies is the space - time development of hadrons in parton fragmentation . in the standard pythia fragmentation scheme",
    ", no attempt is made to describe the space time aspects of jet fragmentation .",
    "there are many theoretical models of how jet fragmentation develops , but little experimental support for any single idea . in the conventional qcd model , hadrons from parton fragmentation",
    "are formed at time @xmath42@xcite , where @xmath43 is the parton energy and @xmath44 is hadronic size .",
    "thus , very high @xmath0 hadrons would necessarily form well outside the medium produced in a au+au collision at rhic . in another picture",
    "colorless pre - hadrons are formed very early@xcite in which case hadrons would form deep inside the medium produced at rhic .",
    "the pre - hadrons form instantly in the limit where @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the fraction of the parton momentum carried by the leading hadron .",
    "one argument against such a hadron formation picture at rhic is that hadrons should not exist in a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the instantaneous formation of a colorless pre - hadron is based on the notion of vacuum energy loss and motivated by the string picture . in a quark - gluon plasma",
    ", debye screening leads to the modification of the string tension and would reduce the rate of vacuum energy loss .    here",
    "we adopt a naive picture of hadron formation , investigate its consequences , and rule it out along with any similar fragmentation picture . in these calculations ,",
    "the hadrons from the pythia events initially form at proper time , @xmath47 , and at ( z , t ) as given by equation 3 with @xmath48 fm / c , to be consistent with the rest of the calculation . in the transverse direction , the ( x , y ) position of the embedded pythia events are randomly selected using the nuclear overlap model .",
    "the individual hadrons in each pythia event are further smeared in a circle of radius 1.5 fm .",
    "this radius is determined by the condition that it is large enough such that hadronic rescattering within a pythia event is small .",
    "figure [ raafig ] shows the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 for pions from these calculations as well as phenix @xmath37 data @xcite at a similar impact parameter . for the model calculations , @xmath3 is defined as : @xmath49 with this definition , we consider only the modification of the spectra of the embedded pythia events , and do not consider the contribution to particle production coming from the rescattering model .",
    "because we inject triggered pythia events into the rescattering model , we only consider @xmath3 for @xmath50 gev / c .     for pions .",
    "the open squares show phenix @xmath37 data for the 10% most central collisions , and the solid circles show the results of the rescattering model with embedded pythia events . only particles tagged as originating from pythia or a pythia - particle induced resonance",
    "are included in the rescattering+pythia calculation.,width=302 ]    figure [ raafig ] shows similar features to the calculations of gallmeister et al.@xcite .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath3 is well reproduced in the moderate @xmath0 region ( @xmath51 gev / c ) , but @xmath3 trends upwards with increasing @xmath0 , a trend not seen in the experimental data .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence arises from our treatment of the space - time development of hadrons in jet fragmentation .",
    "higher @xmath0 hadrons are not able to interact until proper time @xmath47 and they thus travel a distance of @xmath52 in the laboratory frame ( here @xmath53 is the lorentz factor ) .",
    "figure [ c2rescattwithpythia ] shows the two - particle azimuthal distributions from the star collaboration @xcite and from the rescattering events with embedded pythia jets . for the model calculations , we only look at hadrons produced directly from the pythia event or produced via the decay of a pythia particle induced resonances . in the model calculations all hadrons are considered ( charged and neutral ) whereas for the star measurements",
    "only charged hadrons are used .",
    "this should lead to @xmath54 stronger correlations in the model compared to the real data .    as pointed out by star ,",
    "the correlations near @xmath18 are indicative of jet fragmentation , and are very similar in magnitude and width for proton - proton and central au+au collisions .",
    "the azimuthally back - to - back dihadron pairs ( @xmath19 ) , indicative of dijet production , are present in the proton - proton collisions but absent in the most central au+au collisions .",
    "this feature is well reproduced in the rescattering model + pythia jet calculations .",
    "focusing , however , on the region @xmath18 reveals a striking difference between the rescattering+pythia calculations and the star data .",
    "while the star data shows little or no modification of the correlation structure in central au+au collisions compared to the proton - proton reference , the rescattering model leads to a broadening and enhancement of the near - angle correlations .",
    "this is exactly the structure observed in the pure rescattering model calculations ( where no pythia jets were embedded into the events ) .",
    "these correlations are due primarily to the resonances produced during the rescattering stages of the collisions , and do not come from the initial jet fragmentation .",
    "we thus conclude that the near - angle correlation structure observed by star in central au+au collision is due to jets that fragment outside the medium .",
    "if the jets were to fragment inside a dense hadronic medium they would produce resonances that lead to broad azimuthal correlations .",
    "the broad resonance induced correlations seen in the pythia+rescattering calculations are not seen in the central star au+au data .",
    "the failure of this model to describe in detail all aspects of high @xmath0 particle production at rhic is not surprising .",
    "it is unlikely that a @xmath55 hadronic scattering description is valid in the early stages of a rhic collision . for low @xmath0 observables such as elliptic flow and hbt this model",
    "does seem to work . at high @xmath0 , however , we show that this model does not work and we feel that no purely hadronic model can describe the  jet quenching \" observables seen in central rhic collisions .",
    "the nuclear suppression factor will have an unwanted @xmath0 dependence .",
    "in addition , the unavoidable copious resonance production will lead substantial modification in the two - particle high @xmath0 azimuthal correlations .",
    "in particular , we find that resonance decays lead to broader high @xmath0 azimuthal correlations , and there is no evidence in the rhic data for large broadening of the azimuthal correlations .",
    "in general , we find that only correlation and fluctuation measurements , of which high @xmath0 azimuthal correlations are one example , are able to distinguish between a purely hadronic description of rhic data and an interpretation in terms of novel forms of nuclear matter such as the quark - gluon plasma .",
