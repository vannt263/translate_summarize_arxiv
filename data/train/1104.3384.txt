    "quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) is expected to be formed at sufficiently high temperatures and densities and considered to play an important role in the early universe and in the core of neutron stars . in heavy - ion collision experiments , the qgp created is expected to cause a suppression of @xmath1 creation due to the dissociation of charmonia in the deconfinement phase of qcd @xcite .",
    "suppression of @xmath1 particles was actually observed in several experiments at the super proton synchrotron @xcite and the relativistic heavy ion collider @xcite . here ,",
    "not only @xmath1 but also @xmath3 and @xmath4 states contribute to the total yield of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "to investigate properties of these charmonia in the deconfinement phase , hadronic spectral functions are studied at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "spectral functions on the lattice are calculated conventionally by using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite in which spectral functions are extracted from euclidean correlation functions using a bayesian probability theory . with the mem",
    ", the temperature dependence of charmonia spectral functions has been investigated in quenched @xcite and two - flavor qcd @xcite . from these studies ,",
    "the s - wave charmonia ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) are suggested to survive up to temperatures higher than about 1.5@xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the critical temperature . on the other hand , the p - wave charmonia ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 )",
    "are suggested to dissolve just above @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the spectral functions from the mem are continuous as expected in infinite - volume field theories . in the finite volume ,",
    "on the other hand , the spectral functions consist of discrete spectra only , since the degrees of freedom of the theory is finite .",
    "therefore , the meaning of the continuous spectral functions from the mem is not quite clear .",
    "this is problematic , in particular , in cases when the mem leads to ambiguous results depending on , e.g. , the choice of the default model .    in this paper , we propose a method to directly calculate spectral functions at discrete spectra on the lattice , applying a variational method .",
    "variational method is a powerful tool to extract information of low - lying discrete spectra @xcite . in our previous paper",
    ", we studied the temperature dependence of charmonium wave functions for the ground and first excited states using a variational method @xcite .",
    "we extend the method to evaluate spectral functions , i.e. , the location and the height for each low - lying discrete spectra .    with the variational method , information for low - lying spectra",
    "is extracted by diagonalizing correlation matrices between various smeared operators .",
    "the spectral functions are defined in terms of correlation functions between pointlike operators .",
    "we thus include pointlike operators among the smeared operators .",
    "we calculate spectral functions from the element of the correlation matrices corresponding to the pointlike source and sink operators .",
    "we show that the accuracy and reliability of the resulting spectral functions can be systematically improved by increasing the number of smeared operators .    at nonzero temperatures ,",
    "the spectral function for a meson operator @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy of the state @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the finite temperature partition function . as @xmath12 is increased , we expect that the height of each pole varies and , simultaneously , more poles at @xmath13 appear in addition to the zero - temperature poles at @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ground - state energy .",
    "when a particle dissociates , we may expect that the corresponding spectral function shows a drastic change around the dissociation temperature : the height of the pole corresponding to that particle will become lower and will be eventually buried by nearby poles .",
    "our final goal is to clarify the fate of various charmonia at high temperatures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce our method to calculate locations and heights of the peaks of meson spectral functions with the variational method in the next section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : free ] , we first test the method for the case of free wilson quarks .",
    "we construct meson correlation matrices using various gaussian smearing functions and compare the results of spectral functions with analytic solutions .",
    "we then apply the method to calculate the charmonium spectral functions in quenched qcd at zero and finite temperatures in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",

    "a preliminary report was presented in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we introduce a method to calculate locations and heights of the peaks of meson spectral functions with a variational method @xcite .",
    "the euclidean meson correlation function is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pointlike meson operator for channel @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 correspond to pseudoscalar ( ps ) , vector ( ve ) , scalar ( sc ) and axial - vector ( av ) channels , respectively . for ve and av channels",
    ", we average the correlation functions over @xmath21 .",
    "then , the meson spectral function @xmath22 is related to its fourier transform @xmath23 by @xmath24}{\\sinh[\\frac{\\omega}{2t}]}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the temperature . setting the lattice spacing @xmath25",
    ", we have @xmath26 with @xmath27 the temporal lattice size .",
    "on finite lattices , the spectral function consists of discrete spectra only .",
    "therefore , the integral over @xmath28 in ( [ eq : corr0 ] ) is actually a summation over discrete values of @xmath28 .",
    "for the zero momentum case , @xmath29 , we rewrite ( [ eq : corr0 ] ) on finite lattices as @xmath30}{\\sinh[m_k n_t/2]}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .    .smearing parameters @xmath33 for the test of the variational method .",

    "as discussed in sec .  [ sec : free ] , we choose @xmath35 as large as possible in the region where signals of @xmath36 and @xmath37 up to the second excited states ( @xmath38 , 2 , 3 ) are both stable for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 up to @xmath41 .",
    "we use @xmath42 to extract asymptotic values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "our choices of @xmath35 for the @xmath45 lattice are summarized in table  [ t0:20128 ] . on the @xmath46 lattice ,",
    "we adopt @xmath47 for all channels and all values of @xmath40 .    results of the effective mass @xmath36 and the effective spectral function @xmath48 as functions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are given in figs .",
    "[ t_dep_ps:20128 ] and [ t_dep_sc:20128 ] for the ps and sc channels .",
    "results for the ve and av channels are similar to those for the ps and sc channels , respectively .    when we adopt @xmath35 larger than the value given in table  [ t0:20128 ] , we encounter unstable signals at several intermediate values of @xmath39 . an example is shown in fig .  [ level_crossing ] .",
    "we find that a strange level appears at intermediate values of @xmath39 .",
    "as we vary @xmath39 , the strange level crosses the ordinary levels which have milder dependences on @xmath39 .",
    "we find that the strange levels are suppressed when we adopt a sufficiently small @xmath35 , or limit ourselves to smaller values of @xmath40 .",
    "these strange levels disturb the naming of low - lying states and the reliability of the signals . to avoid such levels for all @xmath40 up to @xmath41",
