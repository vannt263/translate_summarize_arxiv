    "x  ray binaries are binary systems harbouring a neutron star or black hole compact object that accretes matter from either a low or a high  mass companion star ( lmxb and hmxb , respectively ) .",

    "owing to the detection of type  i x  ray bursts , the compact object in cir  x1 likely is a neutron star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x  ray and radio behaviour of the source is complex . the long  term x  ray lightcurve of the source has been discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "one of the striking features of the x  ray lightcurve is the periodic appearance of dips . in radio ,",
    "an arc minute scale radio nebula was found ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a relativistic outflow has been detected on scales of arc seconds that is aligned with the arc minute scale jet ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination of the jet with respect to the line  of  sight has to be less than 5@xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of relativistic outflows detectable as synchrotron emission in the radio band argues against a high magnetic field neutron star in cir  x1 ( cf .",
    "furthermore , the detection of type  i x  ray bursts from cir  x1 suggests that the neutron star has a low magnetic field , since the thermonuclear instability giving rise to type i x  ray bursts is suppressed by dipole magnetic fields @xmath9 gauss ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in accordance with this ,",
    "type i x  ray bursts are not found in hmxbs .",
    "the low magnetic field of the neutron star in cir  x1 suggests that it is old and hence the companion star is not an early type star .",
    "so far , clear spectroscopic evidence on the nature of the companion star is lacking .",
    "it has been suggested that cir  x1 has a supergiant companion ( ) .",
    "however , it can be argued ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the source is too faint in the optical bands for the distance of 810 kpc that has been derived from the type  i x  ray bursts ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , found emission lines in the near  infrared spectrum that are consistent with a mid  b super giant .",
    "however , these authors concluded that these features must have arisen in the accretion disc and/or in outflows from the disc .",
    "in this manuscript we present phase resolved very large telescope ( vlt ) photometric and spectroscopic observations obtained with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) .",
    "we have obtained vlt / fors2 spectra of the peculiar x  ray binary cir  x1 using the 1028z holographic grism with a slit width of 1 .",
    "the observations were obtained in service mode on 21 different nights in the period ranging march 15may 15 , 2005 ( mjd 5344653507 ) . in order to sample the @xmath1016.6 day long binary orbital period of cir  x1 we obtained one spectrum per night with an exposure time of 1730 seconds .",
    "exceptions were may 13 and april 4 . on may 13 we obtained 9 spectra with an exposure time of 1675 seconds since that night cir  x1 was close to periastron ( according to the ephemeris of @xcite ) . on april 4 ,",
    "three spectra were obtained since the seeing was higher than the specified conditions on 2 of the 3 occasions . to minimise the light coming from an unrelated nearby field star ( star 2 in ) ,",
    "observations were obtained under good seeing conditions ( seeing between 04 and 13  as measured from the point spread function full  width  at  half  maximum of the acquisition images ) .",
    "the dispersion was 0.86    per pixel .",
    "with the 1  slit width the resolution is about 120 km s@xmath11 at 8800   .",
    "the spectra have been reduced with iraf .",
    "we used the overscan area of the charge coupled device ( ccd ) for bias subtraction .",
    "the data were flatfield corrected and optimally extracted ( @xcite ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using lines from he , ar & ne lamp spectra that were obtained during daytime the day after the observations with the same instrument set  up , as is customary for vlt service mode observations .",
    "the rms scatter of the wavelength calibration was in the range of 0.050.08   .",
    "the extracted spectra were further reduced and analysed using the software package molly .",
    "we corrected the wavelength calibration for potential shifts caused by flexure by cross correlating the spectra over the wavelength ranges 90509160    and 93009500    with the first object spectrum . that part of the spectrum is dominated by features from the night sky which should have the same wavelength in each spectrum .",
    "note that this does not account for uncertainties in the wavelength calibration caused by centroiding or star tracking inaccuracies .",
    "we did this for both the spectra of cir  x1 and that of star 2 that was also in the slit .",
    "next , the observation times were corrected to the heliocentric julian date time frame ( using utc times ) and we normalised and rebinned the spectra to a uniform velocity scale removing the earth s velocity .",
    "correlation of the spectra of star 2 with the first spectrum of that star over the range 80009000    shows that the remaining rms velocity differences are 2.5 km s@xmath11 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] we show the normalised spectra as a function of the orbital period . to fold the spectra we used our best ",
    "fit epoch of periastron ( t , see below ) and an orbital period of @xmath12 days as found by extrapolating the x  ray dip ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "we binned the data in 15 phase bins .",
    "however , none of the spectra fall in the phase range 0.600.85 , hence only 11 phase bins are shown .",
    "the most striking feature is the large change in the profile of the paschen lines . at phase zero ,",
    "large , broad ( possibly double peaked ) emission lines are present .",
    "superposed is an absorption line spectrum that could originate in the companion star .",
    "this absorption line spectrum can be seen clearly at phases 0.20.6 . besides the paschen absorption lines that are often seen in b and a stars , small absorption lines often seen in supergiants can be seen as well , e.g.  near 8777    (; ; compare the cir  x1 spectrum with that of the supergiant system xte  j1739302 in @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is most likely due to he  i.    we investigated the behaviour of the equivalent width of the luminosity indicator paschen12 at 8750    as a function of the orbital phase . at phase 0.40.6",
    "the equivalent width of the absorption line is largest .",
    "assuming that the paschen lines are formed in the companion star , the contamination of the accretion disc at phase 0.40.6 is thus minimal but not necessarily zero .",
    "hence , the measured equivalent width of 2    at phase 0.40.6 is a lower limit . using @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and",
    "we find that the spectra at phase 0.40.6 resemble most that of late b / early a stars . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] , the lines are very narrow and from this we conclude that the star must be a supergiant .",
    "however , we can not exclude that the absorption line spectrum is from an accretion disc .",
    "nevertheless , in order to test what spectral type would describe the observed spectrum best under the assumption that the absorption lines are stellar , we obtained template stellar spectra from .",
    "we optimally subtracted the spectra of 9 stars ( see table  [ tab : ref ] ) with spectral type ranging from b1ib ",
    "f5ia from the cir  x1 @xmath13    spectrum at phase 0.40.6 .",
    "the optimal subtraction is performed on normalised spectra , minimising the residuals using the following recipe : @xmath14 , where a is the assumed accretion disc contribution and b is the fraction of light from the companion star . from the residuals of the optimal subtraction it was clear that the ia supergiants matched the narrow absorption lines better than those of the ib stars . between the ia supergiants we found that the spectra of those of spectral type mid ",
    "b provided the best fit .",
    "the multiplicative factor in the optimal subtraction was consistent with unity .",
    "however , systematic uncertainties prevent us from obtaining formal ( reduced chi  squared , @xmath15 ) fits . since the template star spectra and the cir  x1 spectrum",
    "are not obtained with the same telescope ",
    "instrument combination the instrumental broadening of the line profile is different .",
    "furthermore , the broadening due to the rotational velocity of the stars is different for the different stars .",
    "spectral type & henry draper identification +    .template stars from . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have used the 32 @xmath0band images that were obtained to acquire the source to construct a lightcurve .",
    "the images were corrected for bias using the values from the overscan regions and flatfielded using sky flats taken within one or two days from the science images . to determine instrumental magnitudes of cir  x1 and stars in its relative crowded vicinity",
    ", we used the point  spread ",
    "function ( psf ) fitting routines from daophot  ii ( @xcite ) , running inside midas .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were placed in a common photometric system by removing small magnitude differences between the different images , due to e.g.  differences in the psf and the exposure times , by matching stars between these images and comparing their magnitudes .",
    "this common system was then calibrated using observations of standard star fields ( pg0942@xmath16029 and l110 ; using the calibrated magnitudes by @xcite ) , which were imaged during photometric nights ( march 27 , april 11 and 12 , 2005 ) . as cir  x1",
    "is only imaged in the @xmath0band , we have not determined colour terms . the uncertainty in the zeropoint is estimated to be about 0.2mag . the derived evolution of the @xmath0band magnitude as a function of time and orbital phase is shown in the _ middle panels _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : radvel ] .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0band magnitude is constant except for a brief period that coincides with the x  ray dip and periastron passage .",
    "we have obtained vlt phase resolved optical @xmath0band spectra and images of the x  ray binary cir  x1 . the observed x  ray flux was low compared to that observed during other earlier spectroscopic observations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; ) . if this lower x  ray flux corresponds to a lower intrinsic x  ray luminosity the optical light from the accretion disc thought to be caused in large by reprocessing of the x  ray luminosity might be lower as well .",
    "hence , the putative companion star might be more readily observable now compared with high x  ray flux episodes .",
    "the spectrum we observed varies strongly as a function of orbital phase .",
    "strong emission lines appear near periastron passage , filling  in the absorption line spectrum observable at other orbital phases .",
    "correlation of the absorption features in the 87008900    range gives a radial velocity curve with an orbital eccentricity of @xmath1 , @xmath17 lightseconds and a mass function of 0.019 m@xmath4 .",
    "the question is ; is this the radial velocity curve of the companion star , is it associated with the compact object / neutron star , or are the absorption lines caused by a circumbinary disc ?",
    "the detected absorption line spectrum is consistent with a stellar spectrum if that star is a b5a0 supergiant .",
    "this provides evidence for a supergiant companion star in cir  x1 . similarly , found emission lines in the near  infrared spectrum of cir  x1 that often occur in mid",
    " b supergiants",
    ". those results are consistent with our findings ( but favoured a scenario where the emission features arise in the accretion disc / flow . )",
    "previously , proposed that the companion star of cir  x1 is an early type supergiant .",
    "however , the then known counterpart was later resolved into three stars reducing the magnitude associated with the companion star ( ) which led people to discard the supergiant model for cir  x1 . on the other hand ,",
    "an interstellar extinction of a@xmath18 was used .",
    "this value was derived on the basis of the lowest n@xmath19 measured in the seventies . that n@xmath19 was determined from an x  ray spectrum obtained from aerobee rocket data .",
    "no error was given on n@xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recent n@xmath19 measurements from x  ray spectral fits with more sensitive satellites with a good soft response such as rosat , asca and _ chandra _ give an n@xmath19 in the range 1.62.2@xmath20 @xmath21 (; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite again found a significant lower value for n@xmath19 modelling _ beppo_sax data .",
    "as we will show below there are three independant measurements that are consistent with the higher n@xmath19 for cir  x1 .",
    "first of all , as mentioned by @xcite , a significantly lower value for n@xmath19 would not be compatible with the strength of the dust scattering halo in cir  x1 as found by .",
    "secondly , the distance that would be derived from the low n@xmath19 value is @xmath64 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "this distance is too low to explain the type i x  ray bursts , those require a lower limit to the distance of d=7.810.5 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the equivalent width of the diffuse interstellar band at 8620    that we find in the optical spectrum is correlated with @xmath22 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this provides an a@xmath23 for cir  x1 ( taking r=3.1 ) , consistent with the higher value derived from n@xmath19 which using the conversion of n@xmath19 to a@xmath24 from gives @xmath25 .",
    "for these reasons and since the modelling of the x  ray spectrum is model dependent as mentioned in @xcite we think that the higher value for n@xmath19 and hence a@xmath24 is more likely to be right .    from the distance",
    "to cir  x1 from the type i x  ray bursts ( d=7.810.5 kpc ) , a@xmath26 , and @xmath0=17.6 , one gets an absolute magnitude @xmath27 ( taking into account that @xmath28 is nearly 0 for mid ",
    "b / early a type stars , and using the relative extinction from @xcite a@xmath29a@xmath24 ) .",
    "an absolute magnitude of -2.5 would be too low and even -4.9 is on the low side for standard b5a0 supergiants ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , considering the preceding binary evolution involving significant mass transfer from the neutron star progenitor to the initially less massive companion star and the current x  ray heating especially at periastron the companion star of cir  x1 is not likely to be a standard supergiant",
    ".    let us investigate the consequences of the assumption that the absorption line spectrum and the radial velocity curve track the companion star of cir  x1 .",
    "kepler s third law , the measured a@xmath30 _ i _ and p@xmath31 define a relation between the inclination of the orbit with respect to the line  of  sight and the mass of the companion star ( the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : massinc ] ) . from the spectral classification b5a0i we find @xmath32 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this gives @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is in the range of 1015 ) . to avoid the neutron star going through the companion star at periastron , we constrain the radius of the companion star to be smaller than or equal to the periastron distance @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 r@xmath4 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : massinc ] this yields @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 for m@xmath42 , 5 , 2 and 1.4 m@xmath4 , respectively . the inclination is constrained to be @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a 10 , 5 , 2 , and 1.4  m@xmath4 compact object , respectively .",
    "a normal b5a0 supergiant has a mass of @xmath610 m@xmath4 which would hence fit  in with a neutron star compact object of cir  x1 . on the other hand",
    "it is conceivable that if the companion star of cir  x1 has indeed spectral type b5a0i it is no ordinary star due to the preceding evolution ( as mentioned above ) .    the observed type  i x  ray bursts ( @xcite ) are evidence of a neutron star nature of the compact object .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in the introduction the neutron star has to have a magnetic field @xmath47 gauss",
    ". also the presence of a strong radio jet is not compatible with a high magnetic field neutron star .",
    "these findings seem to be at odds with a supergiant ( thus young ) companion star .",
    "we conclude that if the presence of a supergiant companion star in cir  x1 is confirmed the neutron star magnetic field either decayed quickly to below @xmath47 gauss or the neutron star was born with such a low field .    assuming that a neutron star kick at birth did not give the binary system a large systemic velocity",
    ", one can calculate the radial velocity for local standards of rest along the direction of cir  x1 ( see for instance @xcite ) to find that the systemic radial velocity of @xmath48 km s@xmath11 at the location of cir  x-1 gives a distance of either @xmath49 kpc or @xmath611.8 kpc .",
    "a distance of 11.8 kpc is close to the distance derived from the observed type i x  ray bursts ( @xcite ; 7.810.5 kpc @xcite ) .",
    "the optical i  band lightcurve ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : radvel]e ) shows a clear brightening near periastron .",
    "this is similar in shape to the lightcurves published by and @xcite , although one has to bear in mind that those lightcurves were obtained when the observed x ",
    "ray luminosity of the source was much higher and that the data was phase folded using different ephemerides .",
    "the increase in i  band light corresponds to the phase where paschen emission lines start to become apparent in the spectrum .",
    "hence , it is probable that the enhanced mass transfer rate near periastron is responsible for both effects .",
    "for instance , the emission lines could be formed in the accretion stream from the companion star to the compact object and the enhanced i  band emission could be both due to these emission lines as well as due to enhanced continuum emission related to the stream impact site .     compact object .",
    "the dots are solutions if imposing the radius of the companion star to be smaller than or equal to the periastron distance @xmath35 ( we took the least constraining case of b5i , the radius of a a0i is somewhat larger hence the dots would all move to lower inclinations ) . for each of the solid line ",
    "dot combination the allowed parameter space is that on the solid line and below the dot .",
    "this yields the following constraints on the companion star mass for a 10 , 5 , 2 and 1.4 m@xmath4 compact object ; @xmath50 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the inclination is constrained to be @xmath52 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a 10 , 5 , 2 , and 1.4  m@xmath4 compact object , respectively .",
    "taking an aoi star instead of a b5i would change the inclination and companion star mass constraint to @xmath53 m@xmath4 for the 10 m@xmath4 compact object . under the assumption that the measured @xmath54 is not @xmath55 but @xmath56 , the constraint on the companion star mass as a function of inclination is given by the dotted line ( taking @xmath57).,width=264 ]    in principle",
    "it can not be ruled out that the absorption line spectrum originates in the accretion disc .",
    "e.g.  the @xmath0band spectrum of the high inclination ( accretion disc corona ) source 2s  0921630 shows paschen absorption lines at orbital phases near 0.9 that could well be caused by the line of sight passing through the accretion disc rim ( @xcite ) .",
    "those paschen absorption lines are not present in the k1iii spectral type that has been derived for the companion star in 2s  0921630 ( although x  ray heating effects may result in different spectral types being observed at different orbital phases , cf .  the observed spectral type in cyg  x2 changes from a5f2 @xcite ) . however , in radio observations of cir  x1 superluminal motion has been observed which limits the inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight to @xmath58 ( @xcite ; the limit @xmath58 has been derived assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc , if cir  x1 is indeed further away as is indicated by the burst properties , then the limit on @xmath59 is more stringent still ) .",
    "if our line  of  sight also goes through the accretion disc rim ( at all orbital phases ) it implies that the jet  axis is nearly in the plane of the orbit .",
    "hence , it implies that the jet ploughs through the accretion disc if it originates close to the compact object .    nevertheless , if we assume that the @xmath54 we measured is associated with the binary motion of the accretion disc / neutron star we can derive a limit on the mass of the companion star assuming the neutron star mass is 1.4 m@xmath4 .",
    "this limit is a function of the binary inclination and is given by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : massinc ] . from the discussion above",
    "it would seem that the companion star mass is @xmath100.4 m@xmath4 since the binary inclination must be high in this scenario .",
    "a star of such a mass can not have evolved off the main  sequence in a hubble time unless the star was more massive initially ( at least 0.8 m@xmath4 ) and more than 0.4 m@xmath4 has been transfered already . however , it is unclear whether such an amount of mass can have been transfered while the orbital eccentricity is still 0.45 .",
    "finally , in this paragraph we consider other possible formation scenarios for the absorption line spectrum .",
    "e.g.  in the peculiar x  ray binary ss  433 evidence for a circumbinary disc has been found ( @xcite ) , perhaps the absorption lines are formed in such a disc .",
    "however , @xcite have obtained i  band spectra of ss  433 and their spectra are markedly different from those that we observe from cir  x1 . in ss  433",
    "the paschen lines are double peaked and in emission whereas we find them to be in absorption except near periastron passage . on the other hand the inclinations at which we observe ss  433 and cir  x1 are different .",
    "in this respect it is interesting to note that according to @xcite we will be observing the system through the material that is swept up by the approaching radio jet .",
    "however , it is difficult to imagine that that material is dense enough and has a velocity low enough to cause the narrow absorption lines",
    ". finally , in all these scenario s the velocity changes of the absorption lines with orbital phase are difficult to explain .    a potential way to determine whether the measured radial velocity curve is associated with the companion star is to obtain a high resolution spectrum .",
    "such a spectrum could reveal narrow spectral features and allow for a better spectral classification e.g.  the observed absorption feature near 8685    consists of a blend of several narrow lines if the spectrum is from the companion star ( ) and if the companion star is an a ",
    "star the ca  ii absorption triplet can be separated from the paschen lines .",
    "furthermore , the rotational broadening of the spectral lines could be measured . finally , due to precession of the orbit ( i.e.  apsidal motion ) ,",
    "the anomalous period as measured by the time between periastron passages is different from the period that would be measured by eclipse timing ( i.e.  the sidereal period ) .",
    "hence , if the x  ray dips in cir  x1 are due to ( grazing ) eclipses the sidereal period will over time differ from the anomalous period .",
