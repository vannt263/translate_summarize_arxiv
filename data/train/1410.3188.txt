    "the experiment has been carried out at the vepp-2000 @xmath1 collider  @xcite with the snd detector  @xcite in novosibirsk .",
    "snd ( spherical neutral detector ) ( fig .  [ snd2k ] ) is a general - purpose nonmagnetic detector for a low energy collider .",
    "it consists of a tracking system , a three - layer spherical nai(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) and a muon detector .",

    "they correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 10 pb@xmath27 .",
    "the typical collider luminosity near the nucleon threshold was about @xmath28 @xmath29s@xmath27 .",
    "the signature of @xmath0 events in the detector is atypical of @xmath1 annihilation processes . both final particles , neutron and antineutron , cross the tracking system without interaction and give signals deeply inside the emc .",
    "so , a @xmath5 event does not contain `` central '' ( originating from the @xmath1 interaction region ) charged tracks and photons .",
    "the neutron interacting in the calorimeter material gives a low energy deposition , while the antineutron annihilates producing several pions with the total energy up to 2 gev .",
    "therefore , the total energy deposition in emc ( @xmath30 ) for a @xmath5 event is usually large .",
    "but its distribution over the calorimeter crystals is strongly nonuniform , i.e. the event momentum calculated using energy depositions in the calorimeter crystals ( @xmath31 ) significantly differs from zero .",

    "[ lann ]  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that in the vepp-2000 energy range the absorption lengths are much shorter than the effective calorimeter thickness , about 40 cm .",
    "this leads to a high ( about 90% at 2 gev ) absorption efficiency of produced particles in the snd detector .",
    "the selection of @xmath5 candidates is based on the event properties described above .",
    "we select events with at least two reconstructed photons .",
    "an event must have a large energy deposition ( @xmath32 mev ) and a large unbalanced momentum in the emc ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the condition on @xmath30 provides full rejection of beam - background events and significant suppression of cosmic - ray background .",
    "most background events from @xmath1 annihilation are rejected by the requirement that an event may contain only one charged track with @xmath34 cm , where @xmath35 is the distance between the charged particle track and the beam axis .",
    "for further reduction of cosmic - ray background we use the veto from the muon system , the condition that the number of fired emc layers in an event equals 3 , and the requirement that there is no cosmic track in the calorimeter .",

    "a nonmonotonic behavior of the detection efficiency as a function of energy in 2011 and the difference between the efficiencies for 2011 and 2012 runs are due to variations of experimental conditions during the data taking period , in particular , due to dead calorimeter channels",
