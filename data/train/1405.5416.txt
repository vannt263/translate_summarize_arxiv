    "ever since the discoveries of the first extra - solar planets ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , exoplanetary science has been one of the hot topics in astronomy in the past two decades .",
    "high - precision instruments and missions such as harps @xcite , corot @xcite , kepler @xcite and the future plato - mission have allowed the number of known exoplanets to grow rapidly .",
    "up to date , the exoplanet encyclopaedia ( _ exoplanet.eu _ ) lists a total of 1822 planets in 1137 planetary systems .",
    "better instruments and enhanced observational techniques are pushing the boundaries of detectable planets down to the super - earth group . in order to achieve this goal , target host stars decrease in mass .",
    "m - dwarfs , and also brown dwarfs @xcite , are suggested as they have smaller radii , masses and are less luminous , presenting opportunities for detecting smaller planets orbiting around them , possibly even within their respective habitable zones .",
    "the solar neighbourhood has been photometrically , spectroscopically and astrometrically studied by the recons team @xcite in order to understand the distribution of stellar types nearby .",
    "their latest finding @xcite indicate that m and later type stars account for 60 - 70% of the stellar population within 10pc of the sun .",
    "the fact that they are so numerous additionally increases the chances of planet detections , making m - dwarfs and brown dwarfs even more desirable survey targets . on the other hand , habitability on planets around these stars",
    "will be limited by their magnetic activity ( see @xcite for details ) .    the exoplanet encyclopaedia list",
    "a total of 36 confirmed planets around m - dwarfs with about 2/3 of them with masses under 0.2m@xmath7 .",
    "there are no detections of planets around brown dwarfs so far .",
    "data from kepler suggests that early m - dwarfs have an occurrence rate of , on average , 0.90@xmath8 planets per star with planet parameters in range 0.5 - 4r@xmath9 and p @xmath10 50days @xcite . @xcite",
    "combine radial velocity and adaptive optics direct imaging observations for a sample of 111 m stars .",
    "they report that 6.5 @xmath11 3.0% of the m - dwarfs host a gas giant with mass between 1 - 13m@xmath7 and semi - major axes of less than 20au , corresponding to 0.083 @xmath11 0.019 planets per star in that parameter space .",
    "these results suggest that planets around m dwarfs are abundant , motivating future studies to characterize them in detail ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the evaluation of planet parameters is tightly correlated with the host star s parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore our knowledge about extrasolar planets is limited by how well we can characterize the host stars .",
    "the challenge of determining fundamental stellar parameters is not new ( see @xcite ) and not restricted to planetary host stars ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite generate evolutionary tracks for brown dwarfs and very low mass stars ( vlms ) for different atmospheric metallicities with and without clouds . by comparing observational data to these tracks",
    ", their study demonstrates a variety of plausible stellar radii , and narrowing down this range for a given mass depends on precise estimates of stellar age and metallicity .",
    "@xcite use inverse modelling of directly - imaged data for hr 8799b .",
    "their results indicate that reasonable fits to the data can be obtained for both cloudy and cloud - free atmospheres but with different values for metallicities and element abundances .",
    "such studies indicate the difficulty of inferring precise values for stellar parameters based on atmospheric models .",
    "both , variations in underlying physical assumptions between models and different parameter values , within the same model can lead to a spread in estimates for stellar mass and radii .",
    "it is therefore important to be aware of the limitations of model atmospheres and how they compare to each other .",
    "this paper focuses on the comparison of different model atmosphere families with some focus on the m - dwarf parameter space : effective temperature t@xmath12k , surface gravity spans log(g)@xmath13 ( included young m - dwarfs , log(g)@xmath144.0 , and brown dwarfs , log(g)=5.0 ) , and metallicity [ m / h]@xmath15 ( appendix  [ appa ] ) .",

    "the following model atmosphere families are included in the comparison study presented in this paper : +      all models assume lte , hydrostatic and chemical equilibrium and obey radiative and convective flux conservation .",
    "they model a homogeneous , 1d oxygen - rich atmosphere in plane - parallel geometry .",
    "phoenix models were available in spherical symmetry .",
    "the grid of atlas models utilised spans the following range of stellar parameter : t@xmath6 = 3500 k@xmath14000 k , log(g ) = 3.0@xmath15.0 , [ m / h ] = @xmath16 .",

    "the drift - phoenix models are aimed specifically at late - type stars ( m - dwarfs , brown dwarfs ) and giant planet atmospheres as they also model dust cloud formation . the drift module deals with dust treatment , calculating a consistent cloud structure and passing it to the main radiative transfer code ( phoenix ) .",
