    "as is well known , the deflection of light by a gravitating body was one of the first predictions of einstein s general theory of relativity to be observationally confirmed .",
    "later on , einstein himself predicted what is called today a _",
    "microlens _ : the momentarily increase in apparent brightness of a background star as it passes close to a foreground massive body  einstein . both the deflection of light , and the change in apparent brightness of a radiation source by an external gravitational field , are collectively known as a _ gravitational lens_.    nowadays , _",
    "gravitational lensing _ is a very active area of research , and it has found applications ranging from the search of extrasolar planets and compact dark matter to estimate the value of the cosmological parameters @xcite . in most of these applications",
    "it is only necessary to assume that the gravitational field is weak and that the deflection angle ( due to a spherically symmetric body of mass @xmath1 can be approximated by : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the impact parameter  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that for a schwarzschild black hole , the deflection angle diverges as @xmath4 , allowing photons to orbit the black hole many times before reaching the observer .",
    "this gives rise to an infinite set of images at both sides of the black hole  @xcite .",
    "notice that in this region the gravitational field is no longer weak , and the above approximation fails .",
    "recently , a paper by virbhadra and ellis have renewed interest in such images , which they called _ relativistic images _  @xcite .",
    "later on , bozza  @xcite and eiroa , romero and torres  @xcite developed an approximation method for the case of strong _ spherically - symmetric _ gravitational fields .",
    "in fact , by expanding the deflection angle near the point of divergence , these authors were able to find analytic expressions for the positions and magnifications of the resulting relativistic images .",
    "interestingly , such images were only characterized by the number of windings around the black hole  .",
    "although several authors have began to study gravitational lenses with a rotating black hole as a gravitational deflector ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , most of their approaches to this subject still use the weak field approximation , and focus only in null geodesic motion at the black hole s equatorial plane . in passing ,",
    "we shall mention for the interested reader a nice discussion of a kerr black hole as a gravitational lens by bray  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in this work there are approximations that are valid only for small deviations from the straight line path , and therefore are not suited for studying relativistic images . if we want to consider the phenomenology of the relativistic images in the strong gravitational field of a kerr black hole , no approximations can be taken and we need to work with the full equations of motion for null rays .",
    "there have been numerous articles about the motion of null rays in the gravitational field of a kerr black hole  @xcite .",
    "although some of them have address the gravitational lens problem , most have concentrated in the observational effects on accretion disks and sources orbiting at the equatorial plane of the black hole and have not discussed the phenomenology of the relativistic images .",
    "recently , bozza  @xcite studied  quasi - equatorial \" orbits of photons around a kerr black hole and provided analytical expressions for the positions and magnifications of the relativistic images .",
    "however , these approximations fail when the observer and the source are located far away from the equatorial plane .",
    "moreover , as we show in sec .",
    "v , bozza s procedure begins to fail when the black hole s angular momentum increases near its maximum value , even if the observer and the source are close to the rotating black hole s equatorial plane .    in this paper , we shall discuss the phenomenology of the relativistic images by using the exact null equations of motion , with the assumption that the observer and the source are far away from the black hole .",
    "although this new procedure is far more complicated than previous works on this subject , it allow us to calculate , estimate , and discuss for the first time the observational properties of the relativistic images for arbitrary source and observer inclinations in a kerr gravitational lens .",
    "therefore the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , to extend the study of relativistic images for the case when the gravitational deflector is a rotating kerr black hole . secondly , since the trajectory of a photon will not always will be confined to a plane , we shall also be concerned with photon trajectories off the black hole s equatorial plane . as a consequence of this undertaking",
    ", we show below that all relativistic images deflected by a rotating kerr black hole are characterized by only two integers numbers : namely , the number of turning points in the polar coordinate @xmath0 , and the number of windings around the black hole s rotation axis .    to facilitate reading this paper is divided as follows : in sec .",

    "v , we calculate the positions and magnifications of the relativistic images for several special cases , and compare our results with those in the literature . finally , in sec .",
    "vi a discussion of our results is undertaken .",
    "an appendix is also included to show how the null equations of motion can be solved in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "in this section we briefly review the equations of motion for light rays in the kerr space - time .",
    "we use the usual boyer - lidquist coordinates which , at infinity , are equivalent to the standard spherical coordinates .",
    "we also discuss about the relevant range of coordinates and constants of motion for the case of an observer and a source located far away from the black hole .",
    "details about the relation between the null geodesic equations , the gravitational lens geometry , and observable quantities are given in the sec .",
