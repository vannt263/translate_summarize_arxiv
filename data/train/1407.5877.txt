    "@xmath93 the portfolio @xmath270 ( indicated by a dot on the graph of the boundary of @xmath271 in table [ tab:1 ] ) is rebalanced into a portfolio @xmath272 as can be seen in table [ tab:1 ] , for this particular path the set @xmath273 is a singleton at time steps @xmath274 and @xmath275 , which means that there is only one choice for @xmath182 . at time steps @xmath276 and @xmath277 this set is a convex polytope , and the choice of @xmath182 is no longer unique , which means that other considerations ( e.g.  a preference for holding one asset over another , or a preference not to trade ) may be used to select @xmath182 in @xmath273 . in this demonstration",
    "we adopted a minimum - trading rule , that is , whenever possible we selected @xmath278 . at the final time step @xmath279 we have @xmath280    .superhedging strategy along a path [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we briefly present and compare the result of @xcite and @xcite concerning the representation of the superhedging price of a european option in terms of risk - neutral expectations of the payoff  @xmath149:@xmath281 where @xmath282 is the set of pairs @xmath145 consisting of a probability measure  @xmath140 and an @xmath105-valued martingale  @xmath283 under  @xmath140 satisfying the conditions of theorem  [ th:2012 - 10 - 03:ftap ] and such that @xmath284 for each @xmath228 .    in theorem  6.1 of @xcite this result",
    "was proved under the so - called robust no - arbitrage condition of @xcite and subject to the simplifying assumption that the solvency cone @xmath125 contains no lines for any  @xmath93 ( that is , the transaction costs are non - zero for any  @xmath93 ) .",
    "their proof is based on the scalarisation procedure of @xcite for the dual representation of the set @xmath285 of superhedging portfolios .    by comparison ,",
    "the result in @xcite is free of these restrictions : it works under the assumption that there is no arbitrage opportunity as defined in section  [ sect : curr - mod ] , which is weaker than the robust no - arbitrage condition , and without the need to assume that the solvency cone @xmath125 contain no lines .",
    "it is also a much more general result that applies to american type derivatives , which reduces to  ( [ eq : price - repr ] ) for european options .",
    "the proof is based on the dual construction from section  [ sect : primal - dual - constr ] , which can in fact be used to produce a pair @xmath145 that realises the supremum in  ( [ eq : price - repr ] ) ( though in general such a pair does not lie in @xmath282 as @xmath140 may be a degenerate measure , absolutely continuous with respect to but not necessarily equivalent to  @xmath141 ) .",
    "we have established a close link , indeed an equivalence between the three approaches : the above primal and dual constructions and the shp - algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the primal construction involves primal objects only .",
    "the dual construction deals exclusively with dual objects ( support functions ) . meanwhile , the shp - algorithm switches back and forth between primal and dual objects ( in this case the lower images of the dual problem  ( [ eq : d * ] ) ) . by proposition  [ prop1-ver2 ] , these two types of dual objects are in one - to - one correspondence , which means that the apparent differences between the algorithms are merely superficial .",
    "moreover , all three approaches lend themselves well to numerical implementation : the primal and dual constructions utilise available software libraries for handling convex sets , whereas the shp - algorithm makes an innovative use of benson s procedure . in",
    "both approaches the procedure limiting computational efficiency is vertex enumeration .",
    "an advantage offered by benson s algorithm is the ability to control the accuracy versus efficiency by choosing an error level . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ maple _ package _ convex _ used by @xcite employs exact arithmetic with rational numbers , hence there is no rounding beyond the conversion ( as accurate as one needs it to be ) of input data from real to rational numbers .",
    "while accurate rational arithmetic carries obvious computational overheads , the primal and dual algorithms are efficient enough so this does not become a problem in realistic multi - step and multi - asset examples that have been investigated , where the computation times were of the order of a couple of minutes on a standard pc machine .",
    "one major difference as compared with the shp - algorithm approach is that the primal and dual constructions have been developed in @xcite for the much wider class of american type options , and can handle early exercise problems . in this context ,",
    "european options are a particularly straightforward special case .",
    "it remains an open question whether or not the shp - algorithm of @xcite could be extended to american options , at least in the case of hedging and pricing the seller s position .",
    "it would be exciting to see this happen .    on the other hand , there are limits to what can be expected of the shp - algorithm .",
    "american options present a particular obstacle that this approach is unlikely to be able to overcome .",
    "namely , the case of hedging and pricing the buyer s ( rather than the seller s ) position in an american option leads to a non - convex optimisation problem , which is unlikely to yield to the power of linear vector optimisation methods and geometric duality .",
    "for the same reason , the dual construction collapses as there are no convex dual objects to work with in the first place .",
    "nonetheless , the primal construction can still be adapted to handle this case ; see example  7.1 in @xcite for details .",
