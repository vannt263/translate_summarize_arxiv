    "a measurement of @xmath5 opens an important window on the non - perturbative strong physics involving heavy quarks .",
    "the basic framework of the theory is well understood , however , there is still much speculation - predictions for the width range from @xmath34 to @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we know the @xmath0 width is dominated by strong decays since the measured electromagnetic transition rate is small , @xmath36% @xcite .",
    "the level splitting in the @xmath37 sector is not large enough to allow real strong transitions .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the width of the @xmath0 gives unique information about the strong coupling constant in heavy - light systems .",
    "the total width of the @xmath0 is the sum of the partial widths of the strong decays @xmath3 and @xmath38 and the radiative decay @xmath39 .",
    "we can write the width in terms of a single strong coupling , @xmath40 , and an electromagnetic coupling , @xmath41 : @xmath42 using the isospin relationship @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fine structure constant , and the momenta are those for the indicated particle in the appropriate @xmath0 decay in its rest frame . the contribution of the electromagnetic decay can be neglected to note that the width of the @xmath0 only depends on @xmath40 @xcite .    prior to this measurement ,",
    "the @xmath0 width was limited to be less than @xmath45 at the @xmath46 confidence level by the accmor collaboration @xcite .",
    "the limit was based on 110 signal events reconstructed in two @xmath47 decay channels with a background of 15% of the signal .",
    "this contribution describes a measurement of the @xmath0 width with the cleo ii.v detector where the signal , in excess of 13,000 events , is reconstructed through a single , well - measured sequence , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "consideration of charge conjugated modes are implied throughout this paper .",
    "the level of background under the signal is less than 3% in our loosest selection .",
    "figure  [ fig : widths ] compares the cleo ii.v signal with signal from the previously published limit .",
    "the challenge of measuring the width of the @xmath0 is understanding the tracking system response function since the experimental resolution exceeds the width we are trying to measure .",
    "candidates with mismeasured hits , errors in pattern recognition , and large angle coloumb scattering are particularly dangerous because the signal shape they project is broad and the errors for these events can be underestimated , resulting in events that can easily influence the parameters of a breit - wigner fitting shape .",
    "we generically term such effects `` tracking mishaps . ''",
    "a difficulty is that there is no physical calibration for this measurement .",
    "the ideal calibration mode would have a large cross - section , a width of zero , decay with a rather small energy release to three charged particles one of which has a much softer momentum distribution than the other two , and the other two would decay through a zero width resonance with a measurable flight distance .",
    "such a mode would allow us to disentangle detector effects from the underlying width but no such mode exists .    therefore , to measure the width of the @xmath0 we depend on exhaustive comparisons between a geant @xcite based detector simulation and our data .",
    "we addressed the problem by selecting samples of candidate @xmath0 decays using three strategies .",
    "first we produced the largest sample from data and simulation by imposing only basic tracking consistency requirements .",
    "we call this the _ nominal _ sample .",
    "second we refine the nominal sample selecting candidates with the best measured tracks by making very tight cuts on tracking parameters .",
    "there is special emphasis on choosing those tracks that are well measured in our silicon vertex detector .",
    "this reduces our nominal sample by a factor of thirty and , according to our simulation , has negligible contribution from tracking mishaps .",
    "we call this the _ tracking selected _ sample .",
    "a third alternative is to select our data on specific kinematic properties of the @xmath0 decay that minimize the dependence of the width of the @xmath0 on detector mismeasurements .",
    "the nominal sample size is reduced by a factor of three and a half and , again according to our simulation , the effect of tracking problems is reduced to negligible levels .",
    "we call this the _ kinematic selected _ sample .    in all three samples the width",
    "is extracted with an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the energy release distribution and compared with the simulation s generated value to determine a bias which is then applied to the data .",
    "these three different approaches yield consistent values for the width of the @xmath0 giving us confidence that our simulation accurately models our data .",
    "the cleo detector has been described in detail elsewhere .",
    "all of the data used in this analysis are taken with the detector in its ii.v configuration @xcite .",
    "this work mainly depends on the tracking system of the detector which consists of a three layer , double sided silicon strip detector , an intermediate ten layer drift chamber , and a large 51 layer helium - propane drift chamber .",
    "all three are in an axial magnetic field of 1.5 tesla provided by a superconducting solenoid that contains the tracking region .",
    "the charged tracks are fit using a kalman filter technique that takes into account energy loss as the tracks pass through the material of the beam pipe and detector @xcite .",
    "the data were taken in symmetric @xmath1 collisions at a center of mass energy around 10 gev with an integrated luminosity of 9.0/fb provided by the cornell electron - positron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the nominal sample follows the selection of @xmath50 candidates used in our @xmath51 mixing analysis@xcite .",
    "our reconstruction method takes advantage of the small cesr beam spot and the kinematics and topology of the @xmath52 decay chain .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath54 are required to form a common vertex .",
    "the resultant @xmath47 candidate momentum vector is then projected back to the cesr luminous region to determine the @xmath47 production point .",
    "the cesr luminous region has a gaussian width @xmath55 m vertically and @xmath56 m horizontally .",
    "it is well determined by an independent method@xcite .",
    "this procedure determines an accurate @xmath47 production point for @xmath47 s moving out of the horizontal plane ; @xmath47 s moving within 0.3 radians of the horizontal plane are not considered .",
    "then the @xmath57 track is refit constraining its trajectory to intersect the @xmath47 production point .",
    "this improves the resolution on the energy release , @xmath58 , by more than 30% over simply forming the appropriate invariant masses of the tracks .",
    "the improvement to resolution is essential to our measurement of the width of the @xmath0 .",
    "our resolution is shown in figure  [ fig : errorcompare ]    and is typically 150 kev .",
    "the good agreement reflects that the kinematics and sources of errors on the tracks , such as number of hits and the effects of multiple scattering in detector material , agree between the data and the simulation .    to further improve the quality of reconstruction in our sample",
    ", we apply some kinematic cuts to remove a small amount of misreconstructed background .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppisoft ] shows the distribution of the momentum    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : systematic ]    uncertainties on the width of the @xmath0 and @xmath59 .",
    "we have measured the width of the @xmath0 by studying the distribution of the energy release in @xmath3 followed by @xmath60 decay .",
    "we have done this in three separate samples , one that is minimally selected , a second that reduces poorly measured tracks due to misassociated hits and non - gaussian scatters in the detector material , and a third that takes advantage of the kinematics of the decay chain to reduce dependence on mismeasurements of kinematic parameters .",
    "the resolution on the energy release is well modeled by our simulation , with agreement between the sources of the resolution as predicted by the simulation and analytic calculations .",
    "the largest sources of uncertainty are imperfect modeling of the dependence of the mean energy release on the kinematics of the decay chain , the simulation of the error on the energy release , and correlations among the parameters of the fit to the energy release distribution . with our estimate of the systematic uncertainties for each of the three samples being essentially",
    "the same we chose to report the result for the sample with the smallest statistical uncertainty , the minimally selected sample , and obtain @xmath61 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "we note that if we form an average value taking into account the statistical correlations among our three measures we get a result that is nearly identical with equation  [ eq : result ] since the average is dominated by the result with the smallest statistical uncertainty .",
    "this result is preliminary .",
    "this preliminary measurement is the first of the width of the @xmath0 , and our measurement corresponds to a strong coupling@xcite @xmath62 this is consistent with theoretical predictions based on hqet and relativistic quark models , but higher than predictions based on qcd sum rules .",
