    "let us briefly review the pde model for restoring the degraded ( noisy ) images in @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the degraded image @xmath1 as a real valued function on a given bounded domain @xmath2 of @xmath0 with the smooth boundary @xmath3 .",
    "the restored ( denoised ) image is denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the problem of recovering @xmath6 from @xmath1 , via variational and regularization ( smoothing ) techniques , is a fundamental problem in image processing .",
    "if @xmath7 , then the domain @xmath2 corresponds to two dimensional images , while in the case @xmath8 we have three dimensional images which are of interest in medical imagistic .",
    "we note also that the case @xmath9 considered here corresponds to gray value images , while if @xmath10 , @xmath11 , the restoring process refers to colour images .",
    "the classical denoising procedure is via linear heat equation ( linear diffusion filter ) @xmath12 applicable also on bounded domains @xmath2 if we take in the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath13 on @xmath3 or the neumann boundary condition @xmath14 on @xmath3 .",
    "the solution to is given by @xmath15where @xmath16 is the gaussian kernel @xmath17(here , @xmath18 is the euclidean norm of @xmath19 )    it should be noticed that this restoring method is related to the variational approach @xmath20where @xmath21 is a scale parameter .",
    "indeed , by the classical dirichlet principle , the minimization problem considered on the sobolev space @xmath22 is equivalent to the linear elliptic problem @xmath23while the solution @xmath6 to the parabolic boundary value problem with homogeneous neumann s boundary conditions is given by@xmath24where @xmath25 is the solution to the finite difference scheme @xmath26 in other words , @xmath27the linear diffusion filter , though has a strong smoothing effect on the initial image @xmath1 , has several disadvantages and most important is that it blurs the edges and so it makes hard their identification .",
    "this limitation of linear filters was partially removed by nonlinear diffusion filters designed on similar variational principles as .",
    "namely , the idea was to replace by @xmath28where @xmath29 is a given continuous function and @xmath6 is taken in an appropriate sobolev space @xmath30 on @xmath2 or , more generally , on the space @xmath31 of functions with bounded variations on @xmath2 ( see section 4 below ) .",
    "formally , the euler  lagrange conditions of optimality in are given by the @xmath32where @xmath33    the corresponding evolution equation is @xmath34    if the minimum in formula is taken on the sobolev space @xmath35 , then in the neumann boundary condition @xmath36 on @xmath3 is replaced by the homogeneous boundary condition @xmath37 on @xmath2 with the corresponding modification in .    in specific applications",
    "to image restoring , the continuous image @xmath38 is viewed as a discrete image @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath41 , where @xmath42 display the gray values at each pixel @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the @xmath45 grid spacing .",
    "then the gradient @xmath46 at @xmath47 , @xmath48 is approximated by    @xmath49(here and everywhere in the following , by @xmath46 we mean the gradient of@xmath50    it should be observed that implies , likewise , a smoothness constraint @xmath51 , which is important for restoring the initial degraded image @xmath1 . in terms of the evolution equation , this property is implied by a smoothing effect on initial data @xmath1 of the flow @xmath52 generated by differential equations of gradient types .",
    "the first nonlinear filter of this form was proposed by perona and malik @xcite .",
    "their model is of the form , where @xmath53that is , @xmath54where @xmath55the perona - malik model , was successful in many specific situations and it is at origin of a large variety of other models derived from ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references given in these works ) .",
    "it should be said , however , that a severe limitation of the model is that problem is , in general , ill posed .",
    "indeed , by a simple computation it follows that the mapping @xmath56 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath0 for @xmath57 which , as is well - known , implies that the forward cauchy problem is ill posed in this region . in order to avoid this inconvenience , which has as principal effect the instability of the finite difference scheme associated to , later on in literature ,",
    "equation was replaced by the regularized version ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )    @xmath58    where @xmath16 is the gaussian kernel . a related version of is the parabolic system @xmath59one can prove that this modified model given by , is well posed , but we omit the details .",
    "we shall see , however , in section 3 that the original model is locally well posed in a sense to be made precise .",
    "it should be said , also , that the peron  malik model as well as other restoring models of the form , which are defined on sobolev spaces @xmath60 , @xmath61 , are quite inefficient in edge detection and this fact has the  simple mathematical explanation : a function @xmath62 is continuous along rectifiable curves in @xmath2 and so it can not detect edges which represent discontinuities arising in image domain . for this reason , in @xcite",
    "one chooses in @xmath29 convex , continuous and such that @xmath63where @xmath64 is the conjugate of @xmath65 . in this way",
    ", the minimization problem reduces to @xmath66 , which provides in a certain sense a smooth restoring image with weaker continuity properties along rectifiable curves . from the point of view of edge detection ,",
    "the best choice for ( though hard to treat from the computational point of view ) is _ the total variation model _",
