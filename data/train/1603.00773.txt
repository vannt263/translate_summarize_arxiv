    "the alternating current ( ac ) power flow equations , which model the steady - state physics of power flows , are the linchpins of a broad spectrum of optimization problems in electrical power systems .",
    "unfortunately , these nonlinear equations are the main source of nonconvexity in these problems and are notorious for being extremely challenging to solve using global nonlinear programming ( gnlp ) solvers . therefore , the research community has focused on improving interior - point based nonlinear optimization methods to compute feasible solutions efficiently @xcite . however , these methods only guarantee local optimality and therefore provide no bounds on the optimal solution .    due to these challenges ,",
    "the electricity industry resorted to two main approaches for finding a good tradeoff between computational complexity and quality of lower bound .",
    "the first approach consists of methods for approximating the power flow equations , such as the direct current optimal power flow ( dc opf ) .",
    "the dc opf exploits some physical properties of power flows in typical power systems , such as small bus voltage magnitude ranges and small bus voltage angle differences , to approximate the ac opf by a linear program ( lp ) . under normal operating conditions and some adjustments of the lines losses , the dc opf can approximate the ac active power flow equations with reasonable accuracy @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dc opf can be extended to a mixed - integer linear programming ( milp ) model to suit a wide variety of optimization applications in power system operations such as optimal transmission switching ( ots ) , capacitor placement , transmission and distribution network expansion planning , optimal feeder reconfiguration , power system restoration , and vulnerability analysis , to name a few . in summary ,",
    "the dc opf is particularly attractive because it leverages the high computational efficiency of lp and milp solvers . on the downside",
    ", the dc opf fails to capture important physical aspects of power flow , such as the reactive power and voltage magnitude , which are crucial in many applications to ensure voltage stability and ac power flow feasibility .",
    "additionally , the accuracy and feasibility of the dc opf under congested or unstable operating conditions are questionable . for these reasons",
    ", the dc opf can return solutions that are infeasible in the original space and is proven to be inadequate in applications such as optimal transmission switching @xcite .",
    "the second , more recent approach consists of developing computationally efficient convex relaxations .",
    "in particular , the second - order cone programming ( socp ) and the semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations have garnered considerable attention in the electricity industry .",
    "the increased interest in this line of research stems from the fact that the sdp relaxation is proven to be exact ( i.e. yields a zero optimality gap ) on a variety of case studies @xcite .",
    "however , in many practical opf instances , the sdp relaxation yields inexact solutions @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "an ac feasible solution can not be recovered from the sdp relaxed solution .",
    "the sdp relaxation can be strengthened by solving a hierarchy of moment relaxations at the cost of larger sdp problems @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of the sdp relaxation is that it can not be readily embedded in mixed - integer programming ( mip ) models as easily as lp models .",
    "furthermore , mixed - integer sdp technology is still in its infancy compared to the more mature milp technology .    even more recently , increased attention was given to the computationally less demanding socp relaxation initially proposed in @xcite .",
    "the socp relaxation in its classical form @xcite is shown to be dominated by the sdp relaxation but recent strengthening techniques @xcite have shifted this paradigm .",
    "the attractiveness of the socp relaxation is also due to the fact that socp models can be easily extended to mixed - integer quadratically constrained programming ( miqcp ) models to suit applications with discrete variables , mentioned earlier .    against this background",
    ", this paper aims at narrowing the gap between lp approximations and convex relaxations of ac power flow equations by retaining the good lower bounds of the socp relaxation and relishing the computational efficiency of lp solvers . in more detail , this paper proposes two lp approximations for the opf problem based on tight polyhedral approximations of the second - order cone ( soc ) constraints @xcite .",
    "the first lp model is a direct lp approximation of the classical socp relaxation in @xcite , whereas the second lp model employs strengthening techniques inspired by @xcite which aim at preserving stronger links between the voltage variables through convex envelopes of the polar representation . as shown in @xcite , a model adopting these strengthening techniques neither dominates nor is dominated by the sdp relaxation .",
    "it is important to note that in this context the term `` tight '' designates the high accuracy of the lp approximation of the opf compared to its respective parent socp relaxation .",
    "this paper is not the first attempt to approximate both active and reactive power flow equations in the opf problem .",
    "the lp approximation in @xcite is based on outer approximations which are strengthened by incorporating several different types of valid inequalities . however",
    ", both the computation time and the accuracy of the approximation seem to vary arbitrarily with system size .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , the accuracy of the lp models in this paper does not exceed @xmath16 in the worst case and the computational efficiency is comparable to , if not better than , that of the socp models in most test instances .",
    "in summary , the contributions of this paper are twofold :    * the two lp models are tested on instances from matpower @xcite and nesta v0.5.0 archive @xcite with up to @xmath0 buses and different operating conditions and are shown to consistently produce high approximation accuracies in the order of @xmath17 on average .",
    "* numerical results show that the computational efficiency of the lp models is comparable to , if not better than , that of the socp models in most instances .",
    "this performance is ideal for milp extensions of these lp models since milp is computationally more efficient than miqcp .",
    "the paper progresses with the opf problem formulation in section  [ sec : opfproblem ] , followed by a review of the different types of relaxations proposed in the literature in section  [ sec : relaxations ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : polyhedralformulations ] and  [ sec : lpopf ] describe the polyhedral formulations of the opf problem and section  [ sec : evaluation ] showcases the numerical results .",
    "finally , the paper concludes in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in a power network , the opf problem consists of finding the most economic dispatch of power from generators to satisfy the load at all buses in a way that is governed by physical laws , such as ohm s law and kirchhoff s law , and other technical restrictions , such as transmission line thermal limit constraints .",
    "more specifically , the opf problem is written as in model  [ model0 ] , where @xmath18 is the complex tap ratio of a phase shifting transformer .",
    "[ eq : opf ] @xmath19    problem   is a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem that is proven to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "therefore , solving large - scale instances of this problem to optimality is intractable .",
    "consequently , applying interior - point methods ( ipm ) @xcite to this problem provides no bounds or guarantees on the optimality of the solution , which incited researchers to channel considerable effort on convex relaxation methods .",
    "the next section presents two of the most extensively studied relaxations of problem  , namely , the sdp and the socp relaxations .",
    "the sdp relaxation was first introduced in @xcite and later formalized in @xcite . an equivalent formulation of problem , described in @xcite , starts by setting @xmath20 and requiring that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the sdp relaxation is then obtained by dropping the rank constraint .",
    "the main setback of applying the sdp relaxation to very large systems is that the matrix @xmath23 is dense even when all the data matrices are sparse . to this end",
    ", sparsity exploiting methods have been proposed in @xcite to reduce the computational burden . however , even after applying sparsity exploiting techniques , the computational efficiency of current primal - dual interior - point methods for large - scale sdp is still substantially lower than that of state - of - the - art socp solvers .",
    "therefore , in an effort to exploit the sparsity of the power network and leverage the higher computational efficiency of socp solvers , @xcite proposes further relaxing some selected positive semidefinite ( psd ) conditions in the psd constraint matrix @xmath23 to soc constraints @xcite .",
    "the first condition is that every @xmath24 principal submatrix of a psd matrix is also a psd matrix .",
    "the second condition is that the positive semidefiniteness of each @xmath24 symmetric matrix can be represented by a soc constraint .",
    "more specifically , @xmath21 is replaced by @xmath25 constraints of the form @xmath26 it was also observed in @xcite that the resulting socp relaxation is tantamount to the socp relaxation proposed earlier in @xcite for radial networks .",
    "the soc representation of the power flow constraints [ eq : lf_pij , eq : lf_qij , eq : lf_pji , eq : lf_qji ] was initially introduced in @xcite as follows :    @xmath27    however , is not convex because it describes the surface of a rotated soc .",
    "therefore a convex relaxation of was proposed in @xcite by relaxing the equality into an inequality as in . by defining    @xmath28    the socp relaxation of problem",
    "can be written as in model  [ model1 ] , where , introduced in @xcite , is the equivalent of .",

    "the strengthened socp relaxation of problem   is shown in model  [ model2 ] .",
    "the next section describes how to tightly approximate models  [ model1 ] and  [ model2 ] by lps .",
    "[ eq : socp - s ] @xmath37",
    "this section describes how to tightly approximate a 3-dimensional soc by a polyhedral set .",
    "this formulation is also extended to approximate a 4-dimensional rotated soc .",
    "additionally , this section also describes a polyhedral approximation of the cosine term .",
    "a 3-dimensional soc @xmath38 is a subset of @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 .",
    "one ostensible way to approximate @xmath38 is by a regular circumscribed @xmath41-polyhedral cone @xmath42 , which is described by @xmath41 inequalities",
    ". the polyhedron @xmath43 therefore contains @xmath38 , that is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an @xmath46-relaxed @xmath38 and @xmath47 is the approximation accuracy .",
    "however , this approach requires @xmath48 linear inequalities even for a relatively modest accuracy of @xmath49 .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , the key to decreasing the number of inequalities is to lift the approximating polyhedron into a higher dimensional space by introducing several additional variables and projecting it onto the 3-dimensional subspace of the original variables @xmath50 .",
    "this polyhedral formulation is modified in @xcite to require fewer variables and linear inequalities . in more detail , for an integer @xmath51 ,",
    "let @xmath52 be defined as @xmath53 as identified by @xcite , the projection of set @xmath54 on the subspace of @xmath50 is a polyhedral approximation of @xmath38 with accuracy @xmath55 .",
    "polyhedron @xmath54 in   requires @xmath56 variables , @xmath57 linear inequalities and @xmath58 linear equalities .",
    "this formulation can be reduced even further using and to replace @xmath59 in for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 in .",
    "the resulting polyhedron now requires @xmath62 variables @xmath63 and @xmath57 linear inequalities .",
    "now , an accuracy of @xmath49 would require @xmath64 inequalities and @xmath65 additional variables ( or @xmath66 variables including the @xmath67 original ones ) , i.e. @xmath68 .      the formulation in section  [ sec:3dsoc ] can be further extended to approximate a 4-dimensional rotated soc @xmath69 @xcite , which is a subset of @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 .",
    "the rotated soc @xmath69 can also be expressed as @xmath72 now , and can each be approximated by @xmath54 and coupled by to construct a polyhedron @xmath73 with @xmath74 variables @xmath75 , @xmath76 linear inequalities and @xmath67 linear equalities to approximate @xmath69 .",
    "a function of the form @xmath77 can be approximated by a polyhedron @xmath73 as described in section  [ sec : rotatedsoc ] .",
    "however , numerical simulations have shown that the increased accuracy of approximating by a polyhedron @xmath73 has very little effect on the accuracy of the overall solution .",
    "this stems from a combination of two factors .",
    "the first is the small range of the voltage magnitude ( e.g. [ 0.95,1.05 ] in practice ) and the second is that might be dominated by . to this end",

    "one obvious way is to approximate the quadratic term in by a polyhedron @xmath84 as described in section  [ sec : x2 ] .",
    "however , since the benefit of relaxing the cosine into its convex hull becomes more prominent when @xmath32 is small , a direct approximation of the cosine can still achieve a high accuracy under these conditions ( i.e. when the domain of the cosine function is small ) . in more detail ,",
    "a direct polyhedral approximation of the cosine term is constructed as follows : the subscript @xmath3 is dropped for notational simplicity . ]",
    "@xmath85 points @xmath86 are selected in the interval @xmath87 $ ] and each cosine term @xmath88 is replaced with a corresponding new variable @xmath89 , which allows adding @xmath90 constraints of the form @xmath91 the approximation in requires no additional variables , and numerical simulations have shown that it can result in a high overall accuracy for @xmath92 .",
    "given the building blocks in section  [ sec : polyhedralformulations ] , a tight lp approximation of the opf problem is now possible .",
    "the only remaining step is to substitute the quadratic terms in the objective function by corresponding variables and rotated soc constraints .",
    "this substitution now enables leveraging the techniques in section  [ sec : polyhedralformulations ] to tightly approximate the quadratic terms in the objective function by polyhedrons and thereby obtaining a lp approximation of the opf problem .",
    "specifically , @xmath93 variables and constraints of the form @xmath94 are introduced along with @xmath95 variables @xmath96 and constraints of the form @xmath97 finally , the lp approximations of socp-@xmath98 and socp - s are shown in models  [ model3 ] and  [ model4 ] respectively , and their accuracy and computational efficiency are evaluated in the next section .",

    ", @xmath54 approximates @xmath38 with accuracy @xmath102 . ] all simulations are carried out on an intel core i7 , 3.70ghz , 64-bit , 128 gb ram computing platform .",
    "matpower is used to solve the original nonconvex ac model in problem  , which provides an upper bound on the optimal solution .",
    "additionally , ipopt @xcite via the matlab toolbox opti @xcite is used to compute upper bounds on instances where matpower diverges or fails to compute a solution .",
    "these locally optimal solutions are not shown in this paper due to space limitations .",
    "interested readers are instead referred to @xcite for a complete list of ac ( locally optimal ) solutions with the exception of matpower s case1354pegase and case9241pegase whose solutions are @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "on the other hand , both cplex 12.6 @xcite and gurobi 6.0.5 @xcite are considered for solving the socp and the lp models .",
    "an interesting observation is that the polyhedral approximations described in sections  [ sec:3dsoc ] and  [ sec : rotatedsoc ] , which are the cornerstones of lp-@xmath98 and lp - s , make these models particularly difficult to solve using the primal or dual simplex methods .",
    "this could be due to the large coefficient ranges and/or due to the irrational coefficients ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) introduced by these polyhedral formulations .",
    "for the lp models , both cplex and gurobi use their default concurrent optimization algorithms which invoke multiple methods ( primal simplex , dual simplex and parallel barrier ) simultaneously on multiple cores , and return the optimal solution from the method that finishes first .",
    "therefore , in this scenario , only the parallel barrier method is chosen instead of the default concurrent optimization algorithm to solve the lp models .",
    "ultimately , cplex is chosen to solve the lp models due to a better performance of its parallel barrier method , for these specific lp models , as compared to gurobi s parallel barrier method .",

    "it is evident from tables  [ opfmatpower ] and  [ opfnesta ] that both lp-@xmath98 and lp - s tightly approximate their parent socp models , socp-@xmath98 and socp - s respectively .",
    "however , the values marked by * designate instances where the socp relaxation s solution does not match the lp one despite the `` optimal '' exitflag or vice versa . in these cases ( * ) , both gurobi and ipopt are used to ascertain that the lp solution is in fact the accurate one in most cases .",
    "this is also corroborated by results in the literature , namely in @xcite for socp-@xmath98 and @xcite for socp - s .",
    "these discrepancies are due to numerical stability issues despite the solver reporting reaching an optimal solution .",
    "this is not surprising since it was also pointed out in @xcite that ipopt is numerically more stable than both cplex and gurobi s qcp for large systems , and was ultimately used for solving their socp models .",
    "however , cplex is still used to solve the socp models in this paper for the sake of comparison .",
    "also , the fact that gurobi and cplex are both state - of - the - art lp ( and milp ) solvers , it would not make sense to use ipopt to solve the lp models . in fact , the approximation accuracy is in the order @xmath110 when the solution of both socp models and lp models does not run into numerical stability issues .",
    "moreover , tables  [ opfmatpower ] and  [ opfnesta ] also show that the computational efficiency of the lp models is comparable to , if not better than , that of the socp models in most cases .",
    "this performance is ideal for milp extensions of these lp models , which gives more edge over the miqcp extensions of the socp models because state - of - the - art miqcp technology is still not as mature as state - of - the - art milp technology .",
