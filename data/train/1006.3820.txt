    "the details of an interparticle potential of finite range @xmath0 are largely irrelevant in few - body systems when the two - body scattering length @xmath1 .",
    "this feature , which is referred to as universality , and its associated simplicity make such systems fertile testing ground for methods designed to tackle larger ones .",
    "while the measured two - nucleon scattering length happens to be large compared to the inverse of the pion mass , use of magnetic fields to create feshbach resonances in cold , trapped atomic systems has opened up the possibility of dialing two - atom scattering lengths to values much larger than the typical range of the van der waals potential .",
    "a recent ground - breaking achievement @xcite is the ability to further confine just a few atoms in nearly isolated sites of optical lattices formed by laser beams . at low temperatures ,",
    "the lattice sites may be considered as harmonic oscillator ( ho ) traps .",
    "as long as the ho length @xmath2 is large , @xmath3 , a trapped system still displays universal properties , although for @xmath4 these are rather different from those in a large trap or free space .    at sufficiently low energies ,",
    "an effective field theory ( eft ) has been formulated which uses the separation between the scales @xmath5 and @xmath0 to build an expansion in powers of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it replaces the underlying interparticle potential by a series of contact interactions with increasing numbers of derivatives of delta functions , akin to the multipole expansion in classical electrodynamics . except for isospin , which does play a role in the relative relevance of few - body forces , the version of this eft used in nuclear physics @xcite is formally indistinguishable from the one describing atomic systems @xcite .",
    "( nevertheless , the underlying theories for the two cases are very different . )    as a consequence , atomic systems characterized by large scattering lengths can be studied with techniques developed in nuclear physics and , conversely , can provide tests for few- and many - body methods that can be further applied , with little or no change , to the description of nuclear systems at low energies .",
    "one such method is the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) , in which the solution to the non - relativistic schrdinger equation for many - nucleon systems is obtained by numerical diagonalization using a discrete single - particle basis , typically a ho basis @xcite .",
    "this method is characterized by its flexibility , being able to reach medium - mass nuclei with no limitation to closed or nearly - closed shells and , at the same time , handle local and non - local interactions on the same footing .",
    "the cost of diagonalization is controlled by restriction to a `` model space '' with a maximum number @xmath7 of accessible shells above the minimum configuration .",
    "the ncsm is well suited to handle eft interactions @xcite , which are in general non - local ( in the sense of involving momenta ) and always defined up to a maximum momentum @xmath8 , the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we formulated an eft for two particles that support @xmath9-wave interactions with @xmath1 in a ho trap of length @xmath3 .",
    "the eft interactions are defined within a model space with cutoff @xmath10 .",
    "we considered explicitly the first three orders in the expansion , up to which point only the @xmath9 wave is modified by the short - range potential . in leading order ( lo ) , there exists only one , non - derivative contact interaction , which captures the physics of the scattering length and thus reproduces the results @xcite obtained with a pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "subleading orders involve derivatives of contact interactions treated in perturbation theory .",
    "the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) corrections account for the physics of the effective range @xmath11 and lead to generalized pseudopotential results @xcite .",
    "higher orders can be calculated similarly .",
    "we showed how convergence of the theory as function of @xmath7 can be improved systematically , and is in fact better than for an exact diagonalization of subleading orders .    in this paper",
    "we discuss systems of three and four two - state fermions in a trap . for these fermions , which we can think of as having spin @xmath12 , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite applies and we again consider explicitly the eft to nnlo . thanks to the pauli principle , three- and higher - body interactions appear only at higher orders @xcite , so the properties of few - body systems can be predicted .",
    "at lo , we solve the few - body problem using the ncsm formalism , as done before @xcite . beyond lo , we employ many - body perturbation theory .",
    "a critical aspect is the use of different values of the model - space cutoff for systems with different number of particles , which leads to improved convergence .",
    "this is because the spectator particles in a many - body system can carry some of the excitation energy , leaving less available to an interacting pair .",
    "if the two - body and many - body spaces are cut off at the same number of quanta , some states of the two - body system will simply be omitted from the many - body space without their effects being taken into account by renormalization .",
    "one way to avoid this is to use a cutoff for the space where the many - body system is solved that is higher than that in the two - body subsystem where the two - body interaction was defined . a related approach , in which the two - body cutoff is taken to depend on the state of the spectators , was originally considered within the ncsm formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it was later abandoned in favor of the simpler approach with equal cutoffs .",
    "we calculate the lowest levels of the three- and four - fermion systems allowing for finite values of both @xmath5 and @xmath11 . at unitarity",
    ", our three - fermion results converge to the semi - analytical values of ref .",
    "our improved convergence allows to better pinpoint the scattering length at which the ground - state parity changes , a phenomenon first identified in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequently confirmed @xcite .",
    "we also investigate atom - dimer scattering and compare with ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of four fermions ,",
    "we find a ground - state energy similar to values in the literature @xcite , and give an example of an excited level .",
    "systems with larger numbers of fermions can be dealt with at the expense of more computer time .",
    "our approach has similarities to the one followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an effective short - range interaction is fitted to several levels of the pseudopotential at unitarity , but diagonalized exactly . to the extent that they are model - independent , results from finite - range potentials @xcite should be equivalent to ours .",

    "the ho introduces an energy scale @xmath15 , or equivalently a length scale , the ho length @xmath23 we are interested in systems where @xmath3 , the range of the force between the particles .",
    "we discuss in this section the construction and solution of @xmath21 for few - particle systems .",
    "the interactions are constructed using eft for the trapped few - fermion system . in free space",
    "the two - body interaction can be characterized by its scattering phase shifts . for small enough values of the on - shell momentum , @xmath24 ,",
    "the phase shifts can be described by the effective range expansion ( ere ) @xcite .",
    "potentials that generate the same values for the ere parameters can not be distinguished at low energies : they all lead to the same wavefunction for distances beyond the range of the force , @xmath25 .",
    "this universality can be made manifest by taking , instead of a specific finite - range potential , an interaction expanded as a taylor series in momentum space .    for two - state fermions",

    "@xcite , as long as we interpret the @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ hami ] ) as a sum over pairs of particles in different states . in this case ,",
    "an @xmath9-wave interaction is allowed and dominates . in the cm of the two fermions , and expressed in terms of relative coordinates , the interactions considered in this paper are @xmath27 \\delta(\\vec{r } )      + \\delta(\\vec{r}\\ , ' ) \\left[\\nabla^2\\delta(\\vec{r})\\right]\\right\\ }           \\nonumber\\\\ & & + c_4 \\left\\{\\left[\\nabla\\,'^4\\delta(\\vec{r}\\,')\\right ] \\delta(\\vec{r } )           + \\delta(\\vec{r}\\ , ' ) \\left[\\nabla^4\\delta(\\vec{r})\\right ]    + 2 \\left[\\nabla\\,'^2\\delta(\\vec{r}\\,')\\right ]          \\left[\\nabla^2\\delta(\\vec{r})\\right ] \\right\\ } + \\ldots , \\label{taylorcoord}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are parameters and ``  '' denote terms of higher orders .",
    "since these interactions are singular , a regularization procedure is introduced in form of a uv cutoff @xmath8 .",
    "this separates the short - distance physics , which is not included explicitly in the dynamics of this problem at low energy , and the long - distance physics , which is . in order for observables to be renormalization - group invariant ,",
    "i.e. _  independent of the arbitrary cutoff , the parameters @xmath31 must depend on @xmath8 .",
    "the ho provides a natural basis on which to expand wavefunctions : its eigenfunctions @xmath32 , which can be labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath33 ( radial ) and @xmath34 ( orbital ) , have energies @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the ho basis in turn offers a natural cutoff in the form of a maximum number of shells included in the basis : there exists a maximum relative momentum @xmath37 with @xmath38 the number of quanta of the highest energy state in the basis .",
    "the wavefunction of the interacting system is a superposition of ho eigenfunctions within the model space , determined by a solution of the schrdinger equation with the potential ( [ taylorcoord ] ) .    in the case",
    "we are interested in , @xmath1 , @xmath9-wave interactions are enhanced by powers of @xmath5 over their natural size @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the lo interaction is the @xmath28 term in the potential ( [ taylorcoord ] ) , which represents the physics of the scattering length @xmath5 .",
    "the other terms are corrections , in particular @xmath29 at nlo and @xmath30 at nnlo , both of which contain the effective range @xmath11 .",
    "higher @xmath9-wave ere terms and interactions in higher partial waves appear only beyond nnlo . to nnlo , then , the energies of the interacting system in waves with @xmath39 are not changed relative to the ho energies .    for @xmath40 , on the other hand , the two - body energies @xmath41 are determined from the solution of the schrdinger equation with a superposition of ho wavefunctions up to a maximum @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the largest radial quantum number carried by states in the two - body basis .",
    "the solution at lo is obtained by an exact diagonalization considering only the @xmath28 term in the potential ( [ taylorcoord ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 is fixed by imposing that one known energy , which we take as the ground - state energy , be reproduced at any @xmath45 . at nlo , the @xmath29 term is included in first - order perturbation theory and @xmath46 is fitted to a second known energy , which we take as the first - excited - state energy . at nnlo , @xmath29 is treated in second - order perturbation theory while the @xmath30 term is included in first - order perturbation theory , @xmath47 being fitted to a third level , which we take as the second - excited - state energy .",
    "the energies used as input are the exact two - body energies in the limit @xmath48 .",

    ", the two - body interaction is determined at each @xmath45 from the ere ( _ i.e. _  scattering ) parameters , and can be used as input into the calculation of @xmath51 systems . in general , for the latter we also have to include few - body interactions . for two - state fermions",
    ", however , the pauli principle requires three- and more - body contact interactions to involve derivatives , so that the extra fermions are placed in states with different orbital quantum numbers .",
    "the extra bodies and derivatives come with extra factors of @xmath0 , and the corresponding interactions are suppressed @xcite . to nnlo , no few - body interaction needs to be included here .",
    "with @xmath21 so constructed , we can predict the energy levels of larger systems . we need to solve",
    "exactly for the lo potential , and then higher - order corrections are calculated in perturbation theory , just as in the two - particle case @xcite .    in a shell - model approach ,",
    "energy eigenstates are obtained by direct diagonalization in a many - body basis constructed with ho wavefunctions .",
    "there are essentially two equivalent ways to construct the basis states .",
    "in one , the basis states are slater determinants constructed from single - particle ho wavefunctions in the lab frame .",
    "this leads to the wavefunction of the cm of the system factorizing exactly from the internal coordinates , as long as one performs an energy truncation of the basis states such that all states up to a given energy @xmath52 , @xmath7 being an integer , are included .",
    "while antisymmetry is easily built into this approach , the dimension of the basis space grows quickly .",
    "none - the - less , this method can be applied efficiently to systems of more than five particles . in the second approach",
    ", one considers states that depend only on internal ( jacobi ) coordinates and the dependence of each of these is described by a ho wavefunction @xcite . for up to five particles ,",
    "this is more effective than a slater - determinant basis , but the antisymmetrization becomes increasingly difficult as the number of particles grows .",
    "as long as the same energy truncation is applied to both , the slater - determinant and jacobi bases give identical results for the intrinsic state of any system .",
    "since in the current paper we investigate only systems with three and four particles , we describe in some detail the internal - coordinate approach .",
    "the novel truncation that we employ in the few - body system becomes more transparent in jacobi coordinates .",
    "we work with jacobi coordinates defined in terms of differences between the cm positions of sub - clusters within the @xmath13-body system : @xmath53 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\vdots & &   \\nonumber\\\\ \\vec{\\xi}_{a-1}&= & \\sqrt{\\frac{a-1}{a } } \\left[\\frac{1}{a-1}\\left(\\vec{r}_1+\\vec{r}_2+\\cdots+\\vec{r}_{a-1}\\right ) -\\vec{r}_{a}\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these , the ho hamiltonian ( [ hami0 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the momentum canonically conjugated to @xmath56 .    to illustrate the construction of the basis ,",
    "let us consider three particles of spin @xmath57 .",
    "in this case , two jacobi coordinates @xmath58 , @xmath59 are necessary to describe the internal motion .",
    "the basis states @xmath60_{l } |(s s ) { \\cal s}s;s\\rangle\\right\\ } \\label{eq : basis3b}\\ ] ] have the spatial part constructed using ho wavefunctions with quantum numbers @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 respectively , with the angular momentum coupled to @xmath63 , while the spin part is constructed by coupling three spins @xmath57 to total spin @xmath9 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis3b ] ) , @xmath64 stands for the operator that antisymmetrizes the three - particle wavefunction . if particles 1 and 2 are already described by an antisymmetric wavefunction , fulfilling the condition @xmath65 then @xmath64 ensures the correct behavior of the three - body state under exchange of particles 1 or 2 and 3 .",
    "the basis states thus constructed are eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath66 and the energy of each three - body state can be written as @xmath67 where the quantum number @xmath68 is defined by @xmath69 details of the construction of a fully antisymmetrized basis from the states ( [ eq : basis3b ] ) , the calculation of two - body matrix elements of the interaction @xmath21 in this basis , and the generalization to more particles and three - body forces can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because the ncsm is based on a direct numerical diagonalization , the basis must be truncated to a computationally tractable size . for a system of @xmath13 particles",
    ", the model space is truncated by introducing a cutoff @xmath70 defined as the largest number of quanta in the eigenstates of @xmath66 used to construct the @xmath13-body basis . again using the three - body system as a concrete example , truncating the three - body basis at @xmath71",
    "means keeping only states with ho energies such that @xmath72 .",
    "after the truncation of the many - body space , characterized by @xmath73 , the natural question is what would be the consistent two - body interaction .",
    "since the two - body interaction is defined in the two - body system , it is characterized by @xmath38 . in the conventional ncsm approach ,",
    "it is customary to choose the truncation in the two - body system so that the many - body space is the minimal required to include completely the two - body space .",
    "for example , if we consider just @xmath9-wave interactions , @xmath74 when one describes positive - parity states ( @xmath71 has to be even ) , and @xmath75 for negative - parity solutions ( @xmath71 has to be odd ) .",
    "this was also the procedure used in refs .",
    "@xcite .    however , one has to consider that the renormalization of the two - body system means that states lying above the cutoff @xmath76 have been  integrated out \" rather than simply discarded .",
    "their effects are thus included implicitly in the effective two - body interaction .",
    "when these two interacting particles are embedded in a system with a larger number of particles , the spectators will carry energies associated with the ho levels they occupy .",
    "for example , of the @xmath67 total energy of one of the basis states ( [ eq : basis3b ] ) , @xmath77 is carried by the relative motion of the spectator . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum energy available to the two - body subsystem is smaller than that allowed by the @xmath13-body cutoff @xmath78 and some of the states removed by the truncation will not be accounted for by the renormalization .",
    "one way to correct for this is to use the interactions renormalized with a state - dependent two - body cutoff @xmath79 , as first suggested within an ncsm approach in ref .",
    "however , the resulting state - dependent interaction is difficult to handle in jacobi coordinates for systems with more than three particles , and can not be incorporated in a slater - determinant basis . in order to account for all the two - body physics beyond our cutoff without the use of such an interaction , we simply decouple the cutoff of the many - body problem from that of the subcluster defining any interaction .",
    "such a prescription has some similarity to the truncation used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "each of our calculations is characterized by two cutoff parameters : @xmath45 for the two - body subsystem , and @xmath78 for the few - body system . to the order we work",
    ", no three - body forces appear and so we do not need to consider a separate cutoff for renormalization of a three - body subsystem , when considering larger systems . since to this order",
    "one has to include only @xmath9-wave interactions , @xmath38 is even , and @xmath78 is even ( odd ) for few - body states with even ( odd ) @xmath63 .",
    "our final results are obtained by first increasing @xmath78 at fixed @xmath45 until they converge , and then increasing @xmath45 . for two - body states with @xmath80",
    ", we simply set the interaction matrix elements to zero .",
    "as we increase @xmath78 ( at fixed @xmath38 ) from either @xmath81 or @xmath82 , we observe a rapid dependence on @xmath78 until it is somewhat larger than @xmath38 , the difference reflecting the typical number of quanta carried by the spectators .",
    "for low - lying many - body states , further enlarging @xmath78 makes little difference because we are adding only two - body states where the two - body potential is switched off .",
    "having achieved results for any observable of interest that are stable with respect to @xmath78 for each @xmath38 , we can then take the limit of those values for large @xmath38 .",
    "examples are given next .",
    "in this section we present explicit results for energies of systems made of a few two - state fermions in a harmonic trap .",
    "our goal is to show convergence as we increase the uv cutoff , @xmath45 , and its systematic improvement as the order in the eft increases .",
    "nothing in our method is specifically tied to unitarity ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) and we can carry out calculations for finite scattering length , as well as finite range , as long as @xmath85 .",
    "we can in fact obtain the @xmath86 and @xmath87 dependences of any state , improving on the @xmath84 results of ref .",
    "@xcite because of both the accelerated convergence stemming from subleading orders and the inclusion of the finite range of the interaction ( which in the absence of @xmath11 arises from the truncation of the two - body space ) . in this first study of subleading orders we limit ourselves to three and four fermions , where we can more extensively confront existing results .",
    "systems of more particles can be attacked with larger computer resources .",
    "we consider first a system composed of three fermions , which allows us to illustrate the basic ideas of the method . before considering the more realistic cases of finite scattering length and small effective range , we start with the unitary case , where semi - analytical results exist @xcite .",

    "we also use three - body energies to show how scattering information can be extracted for trapped few - body systems .      the ground state of the three - fermion system at @xmath83 and @xmath84 has @xmath89 and negative parity .",

    "indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ three_fermion_evol ] , the energy decreases until convergence is reached for a large enough three - body model space . the value of @xmath90 for which the convergence is obtained depends on the particular value of @xmath38 .",

    "even though for fixed @xmath45 the errors induced by the three - body cutoff are eliminated , the errors induced by the truncation in the two - body sector , where the interaction is defined , can be eliminated either by taking @xmath45 to large values or by adding corrections that take into account physics left out by the truncation to a certain order , or by combination of the two .",
    "figure [ three_fermion_per_nmax ] shows the convergence with respect to @xmath45 for the ground - state energy at unitarity .",

    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the ground - state energy had a faster running to the exact value : since convergence in @xmath97 is from below but in @xmath90 from above , increasing @xmath90 at fixed @xmath38 pushes the ground - state energy further away from the exact result .",
    "for example , when @xmath98 the lo ground state is at @xmath99 in ref .",

    "for the same @xmath98 , the energy at nnlo is @xmath101 , very close to the exact solution @xmath102 found in ref .",

    "our use of higher orders in perturbation theory allows us to pinpoint this inversion to @xmath136 , very close to our original estimate of 1.5 @xcite .",

    "improvement is significant and systematic .",
    "we have considered systems made out of a few two - component fermions in a ho trap of length @xmath2 using interactions generated by the application of effective field theory up to nnlo . to this order ,",
    "the interactions are purely two - body and determined by the two - body scattering length @xmath5 and effective range @xmath11 .    calculations at lo were performed by solving the many - body schrdinger equation via a direct diagonalization , similar to the ncsm approach , whereas higher - order corrections were treated as perturbations .",
    "we have seen that , as in the two - body case @xcite , convergence is sped up by adding corrections to the potential .",
    "we have shown the necessity of using different values for the two- and many - body uv cutoffs in order to allow for enough two - body states in the many - body environment to match the two - body physics included in the construction of the interaction .    by doing so , results at unitarity for the three- and four - fermion systems agree very well with other solutions , either semi - analytical @xcite or using other numerical methods @xcite .",
    "we also have presented results for finite values of @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "we were able to more precisely determine the ratio @xmath86 where , with vanishing effective range , there is a parity inversion in the ground state of the three - body system @xcite . if the range is known , its effect on the location of this point can be calculated . on either side of this transition",
    "the ground state is universal in the sense of being the same regardless of the details of the potential , as long as its range @xmath170 .",
    "however , the existence of the transition shows that the trap can lead to qualitatively different behavior compared to the free system .    above the transition point , the ground state is the one expected from one atom moving in a @xmath9-wave around a dimer .",
    "we were able to use our calculated three - body energy levels to obtain an estimate for the atom - dimer scattering length comparable to the value found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this work can be extended in various directions .",
    "first , as more data on trapped few - fermion systems @xcite appear , one could determine @xmath11 for specific atoms and predict its effects on the few - body dynamics .",
    "second , one can apply the same method to other systems , such as bosons or fermions with more components . in these cases",
    "a three - body force appears already at lo @xcite , whose parameter needs to be determined from the three - body system itself . the corresponding uv limit - cycle behavior @xcite is expected to survive the presence of the trap .",
    "a system of particular interest is the atomic nucleus , where @xmath11 is known and the lo three - nucleon force can be determined either from the triton binding energy @xcite or from the neutron - deuteron scattering length ( through the lowest energy levels of the trapped system of two neutrons and one proton ) .",
    "we can now calculate such systems systematically to high orders .",
    "we thank calvin johnson and dick furnstahl for useful discussions , and especially petr navrtil for providing us with a code to solve the four - body system . the work reported here benefited from hospitality extended to its authors by the national institute for nuclear theory at the university of washington , and to uvk by the kernfysisch versneller instituut at the rijksuniversiteit groningen .",
