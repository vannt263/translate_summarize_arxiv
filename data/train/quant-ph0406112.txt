    "the development of reliable methods to transfer quantum states is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory .",
    "usually , flying qubits such as photons , ballistic electrons and guided atoms / ions are considered for this purpose .",
    "however , converting back and forth between stationary qubits ( of say a quantum computer or as held by the communicating parties ) and mobile carriers of quantum information and interfacing between different physical implementations of qubits is very difficult and may not be really worth for short communication distances .",
    "an attractive alternative is to use a finite array of interacting but stationary qubits as an information bus .",
    "it would , however , not be very useful if the interactions between various pairs of stationary qubits have to be repeatedly switched on and off to perform the communication , because gating errors will then accumulate .",
    "moreover , the local control required will be as high as that of a quantum computer .",
    "only if we can utilize systems with permanently coupled material qubits ( such as molecular spin chains ) , or systems without local control ( such as josephson junction arrays or optical lattices ) with minimal global switchings , can we have a communication bus much before a quantum computer .",
    "in such schemes , both the amplitude and the phase damping ( mechanisms of decoherence ) can be ensured to be no worse than that of a single moving qubit , by ensuring that there is at most one excitation in the array during the communication process . with the above view in mind",
    ", recently the use of spin chains @xcite and harmonic chains @xcite as quantum wires have been proposed .",
    "the initial system independent proposal @xcite was inspired by the natural setting for spin chain molecules ( and optical lattices ) : regular arrays without local accessibility .",
    "single spin encoding was assumed to avoid quantum gates .",
    "for this simplicity , its specific realizations is already being proposed @xcite .",
    "however , it allows only imperfect communication fidelity and necessitate the use of entanglement distillation from a large ensemble , which destroy its simplicity .",
    "later approaches of perfecting fidelity require either the engineering of the couplings @xcite , or an encoding of a qubit to several spins @xcite . independently ,",
    "local measurements on each qubit along the chain @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the above deviate either from naturalness or from simplicity .",
    "we are thus sorely in need of a scheme which remains natural and simple , yet achieves perfect quantum communication .",
    "this is achieved in this paper by using a dual - rail encoding .    the outline of the article is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "scheme - for - conclusive ] , we suggest a scheme for quantum communication using two parallel spin chains of the most natural type ( namely those with constant couplings ) . we require modest encodings ( or gates ) and",
    "measurements only at the ends of the chains .",
    "the state transfer is _ conclusive _ , which means that it is possible to tell by the outcome of a quantum measurement , without destroying the state , if the transfer took place or not .",
    "if it did , then the transfer was _",
    "perfect_. the transmission time for conclusive transfer is no longer than for single spin chains . in section [ sec : arbitrarily - perfect - state ] , we demonstrate that our scheme offers even more : if the transfer was not successful , then we can wait for some time and just repeat the measurement , without having to resend the state . by performing sufficiently many measurements , the probability for perfect transfer approaches unity .",
    "hence the transfer is _",
    "arbitrarily perfect_. we will show in section [ sec : estimation - of - the ] that the time needed to transfer a state with a given probability scales in a reasonable way with the length of the chain .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : decoherence - and - imperfections ] we show that encoding to parallel chains and the conclusiveness also makes our protocol more robust to decoherence ( a hitherto unaddressed issue in the field of quantum communication through spin chains ) .",
    "we intend to propose our scheme in a system independent way with occasional references to systems where conditions required by our scheme are achieved .",
    "we assume that our system consists of two identical uncoupled spin-@xmath2-chains @xmath4 and @xmath5 of length @xmath1 , described by the hamiltonian@xmath6 the term identical states that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same apart from the label of the hilbert space they act on .",
    "the requirement of parallel chains instead of just one is not problematic , since in many experimental realizations of spin chains , it is much easier to produce a whole bunch of parallel uncoupled @xcite chains than just a single one .",
    "we assume that the ground state of each chain is @xmath9 , i.e. a ferromagnetic ground state , with @xmath10 and that the subspace consisting of the single spin excitations @xmath11 is invariant under @xmath12 an arbitrary qubit at the site @xmath13 of system @xmath14 can be written as@xmath15 the dynamics restricted to this subspace can be expressed in terms of the transition amplitudes@xmath16 the aim of our protocol is to transfer quantum information from the @xmath17st ( `` alice '' ) to the @xmath1th ( `` bob '' ) qubit of the first chain,@xmath18 to achieve this , we need @xmath19 ( which is valid for a heisenberg chain , for example @xcite ) .",
    "an advantage of heisenberg ferromagnetic chains over a non - interacting qubit array is that some xxz anisotropy can make the states @xmath20 and @xmath21 stable against excitations at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "even a small anisotropy in the coupling @xmath22 may suffice ( as @xmath22 itself can be as high as @xmath23 @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , one can prevent thermal excitations by applying an uniform magnetic field to the chain .",
    "the initial state of the system is @xmath24 .",
    "the first step of the protocol is to encode the input qubit in a `` dual - rail '' @xcite by applying a not gate on the first qubit of system @xmath5 controlled by the first qubit of system @xmath4 being zero , resulting in a superposition of excitations in both systems , @xmath25 this is assumed to take place in a much shorter timescale than the system dynamics . even though a 2-qubit gate in solid state systems is difficult ,",
    "such a gate for charge qubits has been reported @xcite .",
    "for the same qubits , josephson arrays have been proposed as single spin chains for quantum communication @xcite . for this system , both requisites of our scheme",
    "are thus available .",
    "in fact , the demand that alice and bob can do measurements and apply gates to their local qubits ( i.e. the ends of the chains ) will be naturally fulfilled in practice since we are suggesting a scheme to transfer information between quantum computers .    under the system hamiltonian , the excitation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : superposition ] ) will travel along the two systems .",
    "the state after the time @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "we can decode the qubit by applying a cnot gate at bob s site .",
    "the state thereafter will be @xmath29 bob can now perform a measurement on his qubit of system @xmath30 if the outcome of this measurement is @xmath17 , he can conclude that the state @xmath31 has been successfully transferred to him .",
    "this happens with the probability @xmath32 if the outcome is @xmath33 , the system is in the state @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the probability of failure for the first measurement .",
    "if the protocol stopped here , and bob would just assume his state as the transferred one , the channel could be described as an amplitude damping channel , with exactly the same fidelity as the single chain scheme discussed in @xcite .",
    "but success probability is more valuable than fidelity : bob has gained knowledge about his state , and may reject it and ask alice to retransmit .",
    "however , as we will show in the next section , this is not necessary .",
    "because bob s measurement has not revealed anything about the input state , the information is still residing in the chain . by letting the state ( [ eq : firstmeas ] ) evolve for another time @xmath36 and applying the cnot gate again , bob has another chance of receiving the input state .",
    "the state before performing the second measurement is easily seen to be @xmath37 hence the probability to receive the qubit at bobs site at the second measurement is@xmath38 if the transfer was still unsuccessful , this strategy can be repeated over and over .",
    "each time bob has a probability of failed state transfer that can be obtained from the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : second_meas ] ) to an arbitrary number of iterations .",
    "the joint probability that bob fails to receive the state all the time is just the product of these probabilities .",
    "we denote the joint probability of failure for having done @xmath39 unsuccessful measurements as @xmath40 .",
    "this probability depends on the time intervals @xmath41 between the @xmath42th and @xmath43th measurement , and we are interested in the case where the @xmath41 are chosen such that the transfer is fast .",
    "it is possible to write a simple algorithm that computes @xmath40 for any transition amplitude @xmath44 figure [ fig : heisenberg ] shows some results for a heisenberg spin-@xmath2-chain with equal nearest neighbor couplings , @xmath45 this model is exactly solvable , and the transition amplitude is given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "however , the results are valid for a wide class of anisotropies and in the presence of a uniform magnetic field , too .",
    "an interesting question is whether the joint probability of failure can be made arbitrary small with a large number of measurements .",
    "since @xmath40 is a bounded , monotonic decreasing series , it must have a limit .",
    "in fact , the times @xmath41 can be chosen such that the transfer becomes arbitrarily perfect .",
    "this has been proven in @xcite , where a generalization of the above scheme and a much wider class of hamiltonians is considered . in the limit of large number of measurements",
    ", the spin channel will not damp the initial amplitude , but only _ delay _ it .",
    "the achievable fidelity is an important , but not the only criteria of a state transfer protocol . in this section ,",
    "we give an heuristic approach to estimate the time that it needs to achieve a certain fidelity in a heisenberg spin chain .",
    "the comparison with numeric examples is confirming this approach .",
    "let us first describe the dynamic of the chain in a very qualitative way .",
    "once alice has initialized the system , an excitation wave packet will travel along the chain . as shown in @xcite",
    ", it will reach bob at a time of the order of @xmath46 with an amplitude of @xmath47 it is then reflected and travels back and forth along the chain .",
    "since the wave packet is also dispersing , it starts interfering with its tail , and after a couple of reflections the dynamic is becoming quite randomly .",
    "this effect becomes even stronger due to bobs measurements , which change the dynamics by projecting away parts of the wave packet .",
    "however , @xmath48 ( the time it takes for a wave packet to travel twice along the chain ) remains a good estimate of the timescale in which significant probability amplitude peaks at bobs site occur , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : peak ] ) remains a good estimate of the amplitude of these peaks .",
    "therefore , the joint probability of failure is expected to scale as@xmath49 in a time of the order of @xmath50 if we combine eq .",
    "( [ eq : probscale ] ) and ( [ eq : timescale ] ) and solve for the time @xmath51 needed to reach a certain probability of failure @xmath0 , we get @xmath52 we compare this rough estimate with exact numerical results in fig .",
    "[ cap : timefit ]    .",
    "the best fit is given by@xmath53",
    "if the coupling between the spins @xmath22 is very small , or the chains are very long , the transmission time may no longer be negligible with respect to the decoherence time ( see section [ sec : estimation - of - the ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dual - rail encoding then offers some significant general advantages over single chain schemes .",
    "since we are suggesting a system - independent scheme , we will not study the effects of specific environments on our protocol , but just qualitatively point out its general advantages .    at least theoretically , it is always possible to cool the system down or to apply a strong magnetic field such that the environment is not causing further excitations . then , there are two remaining types of quantum noise that will occur : phase noise and amplitude damping .",
    "phase noise is a serious problem and arises here _ only _ when an environment that can distinguish between spin flips on the first chain and spin flips on the second chain .",
    "it is therefore important that the environment can not resolve their difference . in this case ,",
    "the environment will only couple with the total @xmath54-component@xmath55 of the spins of both chains at each position @xmath13 .",
    "this has been discussed for spin - boson models in @xcite but should also hold for spin environments as long as the chains are close enough .",
    "the qubit is encoded in a decoherence - free subspace @xcite and the scheme is fully robust to phase noise . even though this may not be true for all implementations of dual - rail encoding",
    ", it is worthwhile noticing it because such an opportunity does not exist _ at all _ for single chain schemes , where the coherence between two states with different total z - component of the spin has to be preserved . having shown one way of avoiding phase noise , at least in some systems , we now proceed to amplitude damping .",
    "the evolution of the system in presence of amplitude damping of a rate @xmath56 can be easily derived using a quantum - jump approach @xcite . like for phase noise",
    ", it is necessary that the environment acts symmetrically on the chains .",
    "the dynamics is then given by an effective non - unitary hamiltonian@xmath57 if no jump occurs , and the effect of a jump is given by the operator@xmath58 which will put the system in the ground state .",
    "as this can be solved analytically , we do not go into numerics .",
    "the state of the system before the first measurement conditioned on no jump is given by@xmath59 and this happens with the probability of @xmath60 ( the norm of the above state ) .",
    "if a jump occurs , the system will be in the ground state @xmath61 the density matrix at the time @xmath62 is given by a mixture of ( [ eq : jump1 ] ) and ( [ eq : jump2 ] ) . in case of ( [ eq : jump2 ] ) ,",
    "the quantum information is completely lost and bob s error check qubit will never show success .",
    "if bob however measures a success , it is clear that no jump has occurred and he has the perfectly transferred state .",
    "therefore the protocol _ remains conclusive _ , but the success probability is lowered by @xmath63 this result is still valid for multiple measurements , which leave the state ( [ eq : jump2 ] ) unaltered .",
    "the probability of a successful transfer at each particular measurement @xmath39 will decrease by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the time of the measurement .",
    "after a certain number of measurements , the _ joint _ probability of failure will no longer decrease .",
    "thus the transfer will no longer be _ arbitrarily _ perfect , but can still reach a very high fidelity .",
    "some numerical examples of the minimal joint probability of failure that can be achieved , @xmath66 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : losses ] . for @xmath67 nearly perfect transfer is still possible for chains up to a length of @xmath68 . in a single heisenberg chain using the scheme described in @xcite , this system could only achieve a fidelity of @xmath69 when transferring an exitation .    even if the amplitude damping is not symmetric ,",
    "its effect is weaker than in single spin schemes .",
    "this is because it can be split in a symmetric and asymmetric part .",
    "the symmetric part can be overcome with the above strategies .",
    "for example , if the amplitude damping on the chains is @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 the state ( [ eq : jump1 ] ) will be@xmath73 provided that @xmath74 using a chain of length @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 we would have to fulfill @xmath79 .",
    "we could perform approximately @xmath80 measurements ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : timescale ] ) ) without deviating too much from the state ( [ eq : nodeviation ] ) . in this time",
    ", we can use our protocol in the normal way . the resulting success probability given by the finite version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : plimit ] ) would be @xmath81% .",
    "a similar reasoning is valid for phase noise , where the environment can be split into common and seperate parts .",
    "if the chains are close , the common part will dominate and the seperate parts can be neglected for short times .",
    "finally , let us mention another advantage of our scheme .",
    "in single chain schemes , bob has to extract the state precisely at an optimal time to obtain it with high fidelity .",
    "our scheme is robust to the errors in this . even if bob measures to extract his state at an incorrect ( non - optimal ) time , he will receive the perfect state conditional on his measurement outcome .",
    "if he is unsuccessful , he simply tries again , without having alice to resend .",
    "also , due to the conclusive nature of the protocol , once bob has received the state , the rest of the channel is automatically in the ground state and does not need to be reset for the next transfer ( as opposed to many of the existing schemes @xcite ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a simple and efficient scheme for conclusive and arbitrarily perfect quantum state transfer . to achieve this , two parallel spin chains ( individually amplitude damping channels )",
    "have been used as one _ amplitude delaying channel_. we have shown that our scheme is more robust to decoherence and imperfect timing than the single chain schemes . even though the encoding is simple , it has made spin - chain based communications _ both _ realistic and perfect at the same time .",
    "our strategy can be generalized to graphs interconnecting many different users , and to many other systems . as an example",
    ", we will now briefly mention how our scheme can be adapted to a _ single",
    "_ chain of qutrits .",
    "the correct generalization of the exchange interaction for a chain of 3-level quantum system is a su(3 ) chain @xcite .",
    "for example , a chain of atoms with three internal levels , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 in an optical lattice , where the atoms can hop from site to site but more than one atom can not occupy a single site , will form a su(3 ) chain .",
    "if we relabel our parallel spin chain states @xmath85 by @xmath86 , @xmath87 by @xmath88 and @xmath89 by @xmath90 , then our protocol can be mapped to a single chain of qutrits interacting via su(3 ) exchange .",
    "though the state is no longer encoded in a decoherence free subspace as before , in an optical lattice implementation , one can use three hyperfine ground states of atoms as @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 to completely avoid amplitude damping .",
