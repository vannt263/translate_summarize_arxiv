    "bars are believed to be very important with regard to the dynamical and secular evolution of disk galaxies , particularly in redistributing the angular momentum of the baryonic and dark matter components of disk galaxies @xcite .",

    "additional evidence for secular evolution is provided by box- or peanut - shaped bulges in inclined galaxies .",
    "these features are commonly attributed to the orbital structure , resonances , and vertical instabilities in a barred potential @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", it is possible to model some aspects of the evolution of disks and bars , and their interactions ( e.g. , the corresponding simulations are able to reproduce certain broad features of barred disks ) .",
    "however , it remains unclear why a specific galaxy has a bar , but a seemingly similar galaxy is unbarred ; or why some barred galaxies have a classical bulge , whereas others harbor a disky bulge , etc .",
    "this might indicate that specific properties of the disks or the particular processes involved in their formation have a strong impact on their ability to form a bar . in order to investigate , how disk and bar formation are related , it is not only important to determine the fraction of disk galaxies that are barred , but also to relate bar and disk properties .",
    "there are different methods to find and characterize bars .",
    "the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rc3 ) uses three bar strength families ( sa , sab , and sb ) to characterize bars based on a visual inspection of blue light images . using",
    "this classification @xcite showed that the optical fraction of strong bars in disk galaxies rises from sc galaxies towards later - types .",
    "more quantitative measures , such as the gravitational torque method @xcite , or fourier dissection @xcite , were also used , not only to find bars , but to quantitatively determine bar strengths and bar lengths .",
    "similarly , the method of fitting ellipses to galaxy isophotes provides a tool to characterize the length and shape of bars @xcite .",
    "these efforts were able to shed light on the fraction , shapes , and structures of bars in local disk galaxies of early to intermediate hubble types .",
    "first attempts were made to relate the presence of a bar or its structural properties to other galaxy characteristics .",
    "however , there were three important limitations .",
    "firstly , samples used in earlier studies were small ( @xmath30 to 200 objects ) and mostly composed of bright galaxies of early to intermediate hubble types ( sa to sc ) , with fairly prominent bulges .",
    "one could barely get decent number statistics for bars in early - type disk galaxies , while the bins of disk - dominated late hubble types were dominated by poisson noise ( e.g. , see figure 16 in mj07 ) . secondly , with such small samples",
    ", it was difficult to bin galaxies in terms of the galaxy host properties .",
    "thirdly , earlier samples were drawn from a very small volume , and could be highly impacted by cosmic variance .    in the present study",
    ", we use a sample of @xmath4 galaxies , at @xmath31 with @xmath32 to @xmath33 mag .",
    "the first advantage of this study is that it provides a factor of 10 improvement in number statistics and reduces the effect of cosmic variance by selecting galaxies drawn from a larger volume .",
    "secondly , with @xmath4 galaxies , we can for the first time have @xmath34 galaxies per bin , while binning galaxies in terms of host galaxy parameters , such as luminosity , measures of bulge - to - disk ( @xmath14 ) ratios , size , colors , surface brightness , etc .",
    "this allows us to conduct a comprehensive study of barred and unbarred galaxies as a function of host galaxy properties .",
    "thirdly , our sample has a large number of galaxies , which are relatively faint ( @xmath35 mag ) or / and appear disk - dominated , characteristic of late hubble types .",
    "this allows us to shed light on what happens to bars at the fainter end of the luminosity function and in the regime of disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "a fourth goal of our study is to provide a reference baseline for bars at @xmath21 in the _ rest - frame optical _ for intermediate redshift @xmath22 surveys using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , such as the tadpole field @xcite , the galaxy evolution from morphologies and seds ( gems , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and cosmos @xcite , which trace bars in the rest - frame optical band at @xmath26 ( look - back times of 38 gyr ) .",
    "we use sdss to provide the reference point at @xmath36 in the @xmath5-band , complementing the one in the @xmath37-band of mj07 .",
    "our @xmath37- and @xmath5-band results can be directly compared to @xmath22 acs optical studies of bars in bright disks at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the validity of this comparison is reinforced by the fact that we use the same procedure of ellipse fits ( @xmath29 [ meth ] ) that were used by these studies .",
    "we also note that the reference @xmath36 point for bars in the near - infrared band @xcite is not appropriate for comparison with the above @xmath22 acs surveys , which trace the rest - frame optical rather than the rest - frame near - infrared .    the outline of the paper is as follows : in @xmath29 [ samsel ] we present our sample selection .",
    "the method used to find and characterize bars is explained in @xmath29 [ meth ] . in @xmath29 [ resol ]",
    "we discuss the detection limits .",
    "our results and more detailed assessments of specific findings are presented in @xmath29 [ resul ] .",
    "we discuss our results in @xmath29 [ discu ] and summarize our conclusions in @xmath29 [ sum ] . throughout the paper",

    "our sample of local disk galaxies is drawn from the low - redshift catalog of the new york university value - added catalog ( nyu - vagc , * ? ? ?",

    "the low - redshift catalog consists of 28089 galaxies at distances of 10200 mpc ( @xmath45 ) , which have been determined by correcting for peculiar velocities . for each galaxy",
    ", background subtracted and deblended images in @xmath46 as well as individual psf - frames are available .",
    "we selected galaxies in the redshift range @xmath47 , having @xmath48 mag .",
    "the typical seeing ( @xmath49 ) corresponds to 290 to 840 pc over @xmath2 .",
    "this is adequate for resolving large - scale bars , which are the focus of this study .",
    "large - scale bars have diameters @xmath50 2 kpc and their lengths encompass at least 2.5 independent psfs , allowing them to be resolved and fitted .",
    "we note that bars with diameters below 2 kpc or semi major axis @xmath51 kpc are typically considered as nuclear rather than large - scale bars @xcite .",
    "nuclear bars are not the focus of this study and are excluded from our results .",
    "hence , it is not a source of concern , if some of them are unresolved by the data .",
    "the selected sample is complete down to @xmath48 mag in the chosen redshift range and consists of 3692 objects .",
    "the magnitude distribution covers @xmath52 to @xmath33 mag ( figure [ cmd ] ) .",
    "we use the galfit @xcite software to perform single component srsic fits of the form @xmath53\\ ] ] to the 2d - images , which provide srsic indices ( @xmath54 ) and half - light radii ( @xmath12 ) for the galaxies .",
    "@xmath55 is the pixel surface brightness at @xmath12 and @xmath56 is a dependent variable and coupled to @xmath54 .",
    "the optical bar fraction is defined as the sample of disk galaxies that host large - scale bars , hence we must first define a sample of disk systems .",
    "there are two common methods to separate disks and elliptical galaxies . for giant galaxies ,",
    "the first method is to use the srsic index from single component fits and define giant disk galaxies to have @xmath57 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second method is to apply a color cut defined in color - magnitude space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming that disk galaxies are predominantly bluer , star - forming systems .",
    "both methods have limitations .",
    "the color cut may miss out disk systems that are red due to the presence of a dusty starburst .",
    "the srsic cut may be contaminated by some bright and rather blue dwarf ellipticals and miss out certain galaxies with point - like agn sources .",
    "we applied both methods to our sample as illustrated in figure [ cmd ] and [ cuts ] .",
    "the corresponding disk samples have an overlap of @xmath58 ( figures [ cuts ] and [ magd ] ) . in figure [ cuts ] the color - selected and srsic - selected samples are plotted in the @xmath59 versus @xmath54 plane , with the color - selected galaxies in blue , and the good overlap is evident .",
    "figure [ magd ] shows the similar magnitude distributions of the color - selected and srsic - selected disk samples from sdss .",
    "figure [ magd ] also illustrates a crucial property of the sdss disk sample .",
    "the sample covers a magnitude range of @xmath60 mag , but is clearly dominated by fainter galaxies ( @xmath52 to @xmath61 mag ) .",
    "furthermore , visual inspection shows that a large fraction of these galaxies seems to be disk - dominated , with little or no bulge visible .",
    "we do not have hubble types for these sdss galaxies , but these characteristics are typical of late type galaxies ( sd , sm ) .",
    "this is a crucial point and has to be kept in mind for the discussion of the results presented below . as discussed in @xmath29 [ intro ] , such galaxies are underrepresented in most studies of bars in local disk galaxies carried out to date . as an illustration , the magnitude distribution in @xmath62 of spirals in the osu bright spiral galaxy survey ( osubsgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is overplotted in figure [ magd ] .",
    "this sample is often used as a reference sample for bars at @xmath36 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mj07 ) .",
    "we finally opted for the color cut , since the contamination of @xmath57 objects in the sample is slightly smaller than the fraction of red sequence galaxies in the sample defined by @xmath57 .",
    "we applied the color cut @xmath63 @xcite , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is used in this paper .",
    "this cut is parallel to the red sequence in the color - magnitude diagram and stems from an empirical fit to the evolution of the color - magnitude relation for galaxy clusters at different redshifts .",
    "it therefore corresponds to a definition of the red sequence based on a number of nearby and distant clusters , but shifted by 0.25 mag to the blue .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for our sample is shown in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "the solid line indicates the color cut .",
    "the resulting sample of disk galaxies contains 1961 objects .",
    "the sample in this paper only includes galaxies in the redshift range @xmath66 . for completeness , we mention that the analysis outlined in @xmath29 [ resul ] has also been performed on the 1890 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath67 to 0.04 , and yields essentially the same results .",
    "we did not include these galaxies in the sample of this paper because the seeing at @xmath68  0.04 ( @xmath49 or 1.1 kpc ) is in the limiting range where we can still resolve large - scale bars of diameter @xmath50  2 kpc , but the fit may not be as robust .",
    "the method used to find and characterize bars in disk galaxies is based on fitting ellipses to the isophotes on the @xmath5-band images of our sample galaxies , along with a set of quantitative criteria outlined below .",
    "we opted for the @xmath5-band , because it provides deeper images than observations in the other sdss filters .",
    "many observational studies have used and refined the method of fitting ellipses to characterize bars @xcite .",
    "there is also a strong body of theoretical evidence @xcite supporting this approach , as outlined in mj07 . in particular , @xcite studied orbits in analytic potentials of barred galaxies and showed that generalized ellipses are a good representation of the main bar - supporting stellar orbits .",
    "the departure of ellipses fitted by the iraf task ellipse from these generalized ellipses is characterized by the value of the harmonic amplitudes a3 , b3 , a4 , and b4 , and we find that they are small ( typically @xmath69 ) .    when using ellipse fits to characterize bars and disks , we use the method and steps developed by @xcite and described in detail in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we give a short description .",
    "we use the standard task ellipse to fit ellipses to the images out to a certain radius @xmath70 , which is determined to be the radius where the galaxy isophotes reach the sky level .",
    "an iterative wrapper is used to run ellipse up to 300 times for each object in order to get a good fit across the whole galaxy .",
    "we performed ellipse fits for the subsample of 1961 disk galaxies defined by the color cut . for 101 ( @xmath71 ) galaxies ,",
    "no ellipses could be fitted , mainly due to the fact that the fitting routine could not find the galaxy center .",
    "this is typically the case for strongly disturbed galaxies , or on images where a foreground object was not properly removed . in both cases ,",
    "the surface brightness of the galaxies is not steadily decreasing from the center toward larger radii , but is rather oscillating between higher and lower values impeding a proper ellipse fit .",
    "the remaining 1860 galaxies have then been classified in the way described below . from the best fit for each galaxy ,",
    "we plot the associated radial profiles of surface brightness ( sb ) , ellipticity ( @xmath72 ) , and position angle ( pa ) .",
    "furthermore , the fitted ellipses are overplotted onto the galaxy images to generate overlays .",
    "examples of the radial profiles and the overlays are shown in figures [ pincl ] , [ pbar ] , and [ punbar ] . during the classification process , the plots , the images , and overlays of the fitted ellipses onto the images ,",
    "are displayed using an interactive visualization tool @xcite , and used to classify a galaxy as ` inclined ' , ` barred ' , or ` unbarred ' .",
    "we use the ellipticity in the outer disk to estimate the inclination @xmath73 .",
    "we adopt the standard procedure of excluding all objects with an inclination @xmath74 , as morphological and structural analysis are unreliable in highly inclined galaxies .",
    "figure [ pincl ] shows an example of such a case .",
    "we find 648 galaxies ( @xmath75 ) with @xmath74 . in figure [ incl ]",
    "we show the luminosity and color distributions of the galaxies with @xmath74 compared to the ones with @xmath76 .",
    "the distributions in terms of absolute magnitude are very similar , whereas the more inclined galaxies tend to be redder than the more face - on objects .",
    "this is expected due to the dust extinction in the disks .    in the next step ,",
    "we classify the galaxies with @xmath76 as unbarred or barred , based on the following quantitative criteria : ( 1 ) the ellipticity increases steadily to a global maximum greater than 0.25 , while the pa value remains constant ( within @xmath77 ) , and ( 2 ) the ellipticity then drops by at least 0.1 and the pa changes at the transition from the bar to the disk region ( figures [ pbar ] and [ punbar ] show examples of a barred and unbarred galaxy , respectively ) .",
    "criterion ( 1 ) is based on the fact that in the region where bars are dominated by the ` @xmath78 ' family of periodic stellar orbits @xcite , we expect the ellipses to be aligned along the bar pa and to become increasingly eccentric toward the end of the bar .",
    "therefore , the ellipticity should reach a global maximum and the pa should not fluctuate strongly . this is intuitively evident from the fact that bars appear morphologically as linear elliptical features centered on the galaxy .",
    "the requirement that the pa must remain constant in the bar region is important for excluding other features , such as spiral arms that may have a high global ellipticity .",
    "criterion ( 2 ) is applied , because the disks are mostly more circular than the bar for moderately inclined galaxies and the disk and bar have different pa in general . after having classified a galaxy , we use the interactive display tool to measure the ellipticity ,",
    "pa , and semi - major axis of its outer disk . for galaxies classified as barred we measure the same quantities , as well as the maximum ellipticity , @xmath79 , of the bar and the radius , @xmath80 , of maximum bar ellipticity .",
    "we use @xmath79 as a partial measure of the bar strength and the radius @xmath80 as an estimate for the semi - major axis of the bar .",
    "a detailed theoretical and empirical justification of this approach is provided in @xcite and mj07 .",
    "some of the galaxies exhibit all features required to be classified as barred , except the ` constant pa ' criterion , i.e. their pa twists .",
    "these galaxies are classified as ` twisted ' , but regarded as unbarred .",
    "however , some of these galaxies could be weakly barred , since in weak bars the dust lanes on the leading edge of the bar are curved @xcite , which could cause an isophotal twist .",
    "the number of such objects is not very high ( @xmath81 ) and therefore they do not significantly affect the results .",
    "we note that the classifications and the measurements of sizes , ellipticities etc .",
    "are performed on the _ observed _ images and profiles , which are affected by projection effects .",
    "we did not attempt to deproject our galaxies , since it is difficult to determine the pa in the outer disks accurately enough , in order to obtain a reliable deprojection .",
    "this is particularly true for disks with ellipticities @xmath82 , for which the uncertainty of the pa determination can reach up to 3040 degrees in our data .",
    "furthermore , mj07 have shown that the statistical results before and after deprojecting their galaxies are very similar .",
    "finally , we note that our undeprojected results can be directly compared with studies of barred galaxies at intermediate redshifts , where deprojection has not been carried out @xcite .    out of our sample of 1860 disk galaxies",
    ", we find 553 to be barred , 591 to be unbarred ( including 76 classified as twisted ) , and 648 to be too inclined ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we did not classify the remaining 68 galaxies for the following reasons . for 30 galaxies ,",
    "the ellipse fits obviously failed or the profiles were extremely messy : this occurred , when foreground / background objects are not completely removed or for galaxies , with very low surface brightnesses and very irregular shapes .",
    "the other 38 galaxies were ambiguous cases where deprojection might make a large difference .",
    "specifically , in these galaxies , the ellipticity rises smoothly to a _",
    "maximum while the pa stays relatively constant , but this maximum ellipticity is less than that of the outer disk . in such cases",
    ", deprojection may turn the local maximum into a global maximum , particularly if the bar is perpendicular to the line of nodes .",
    "these objects are further discussed in @xmath29 [ resol ] .    in table",
    "[ basic ] we give the median values of the basic properties for the barred , unbarred , inclined , and unclassifiable objects .",
    "when using optical images , the obscuration of bars by dust and star formation can prevent their unambiguous detection . comparing the results of quantitative bar studies conducted in the optical and in the near - infrared , shows that the nir bar fraction can be a factor of @xmath83 higher than in the optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore clear that we miss bars due to dust extinction and that our bar fraction has to be considered as a lower limit .",
    "furthermore , our results can only be compared to studies , which have also been performed using observations in the optical .",
    "apart from dust , the ability to detect a bar in a galaxy depends on its distance , its inclination , the angle @xmath84 between the line of nodes and the pa of the bar , as well as on the point spread function ( psf ) or seeing of the images used .",
    "we discuss each of these factors below .",
    "the largest allowed inclination in our sample is @xmath73  =  @xmath85 .",
    "when computing the smallest measurable bar diameter @xmath86 , we assume that a bar is detectable only if its diameter can encompass at least 2.5 times the psf ( @xmath49 ) of the images .",
    "the median seeing or psf of the @xmath5-band images from sdss is @xmath49 , which corresponds to @xmath87 pc at @xmath88 ( our lower redshift limit ) and to @xmath89 pc at @xmath67 ( our upper redshift limit ) .",
    "if a bar , which would be detectable in a face - on disk , happens to be perpendicular to the line of nodes in an inclined disk ( i.e. @xmath90 ) , projection effects will reduce its apparent length and ellipticity compared to the intrinsic value , and this length may fall below the detection limit . for values of @xmath84 below @xmath91 , these effects are less severe .",
    "the variation of the detection limit @xmath86 as a function of @xmath84 , @xmath73 , and @xmath92 is shown by the 5 diagonal lines in figure [ see ] .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the minimum bar diameter ( 2 kpc ) of large - scale bars , and ideally , we want the detection limit to lie below this line at all redshifts .",
    "the two solid diagonal lines indicate the detection limits as a function of redshift for two different inclinations ( @xmath73  =  @xmath93 and @xmath73  =  @xmath85 ) and the worst case scenario of @xmath84  =  @xmath91 . in that case , with @xmath73  =  @xmath93 and @xmath84  =  @xmath91 , we start missing the smallest large - scale bars at @xmath94  0.02 .",
    "the two dashed diagonal lines on figure [ see ] represent the detection limits for a more moderate @xmath84 of @xmath95 . in that case , with @xmath73  =  @xmath93 and @xmath84  =  @xmath95 , we start missing the smallest large - scale bars at @xmath96  0.027 . finally , the dotted diagonal line on figure [ see ] represents the face - on case ( @xmath73  =  @xmath97 ) where , independent of @xmath84 , bars with diameters @xmath98 kpc are detectable out to @xmath67 .    in figure",
    "[ red ] , we plot histograms of the absolute bar diameters in three different redshift bins and for the whole sample ( the bin boundaries have been chosen in order to obtain roughly the same number of objects per bin ) .",
    "the vertical lines indicate our bar diameter limit of 2 kpc .",
    "figure [ red ] shows that we do not miss significant numbers of small bars with increasing redshift .",
    "we find roughly the same number of bars with @xmath99 kpc in the lowest and in the highest redshift bins .    in order to gauge the impact of projection effects on the derived bar ellipticities , we plot the distributions of barred and unbarred galaxies as a function of disk ellipticity in figure [ ell]a .",
    "the cutoff at disk ellipticities ( @xmath100 ) at 0.5 is due to the fact that highly inclined disks with @xmath101 are discarded from our sample ( @xmath29 [ meth ] ) .",
    "as @xmath100 varies from 0 to 0.5 , the total number of barred objects decreases only slightly at @xmath102 .",
    "this fall could be attributed to two related factors . for a feature",
    "to be classified as a bar , our criterion ( 1 ) in @xmath29 [ meth ] requires its maximum ellipticity to reach a _",
    "global _ maximum , which is higher than the ellipticity @xmath100 of the outer disk .",
    "at high inclinations , where @xmath100 is high , this criterion may not be satisfied even if the feature is truly a bar .",
    "some of the 38 ` unclassifiable ' galaxies that we discussed at the end of @xmath29 [ meth ] fall in this category .",
    "a second factor is that if @xmath84 is close to @xmath91 , then at high inclination @xmath73 or @xmath100 , the bar ellipticity is lowered significantly , making it fail criterion ( 1 ) .",
    "however , it is clear from figure [ ell]a , that the number of bars we might miss in the two highest ellipticity bins ( @xmath103 ) is not very high .",
    "the distribution of bar ellipticities ( @xmath79 ) in disks of different ellipticities ( @xmath100 ) is shown in figure [ ell]b .",
    "the vertical line at @xmath104 indicates the exclusion of highly inclined disks .",
    "the diagonal solid line is defined by @xmath100  =  @xmath79 .",
    "all detected bars lie to the left of this line , reflecting the criterion ( 1 ) that the bar ellipticity @xmath79 must be a global maximum .",
    "we note that the maximum @xmath79 is similar at different @xmath100 , indicating that the detection of strong bars is not biased to the more inclined disks .    in the next sections , we perform checks to verify that the results presented are not dominated by the afore - discussed detection limits .",
    "we verify , for instance , that the results over @xmath2 , also hold in the lower redshift bins @xmath105 .",
    "we also verify that derived properties of bars hold for bars with a wide range of diameters , and are not biased by the smallest large - scale bars with diameters close or slightly higher 2 kpc , since the latter bars are more susceptible to detection problems .",
    "as noted in @xmath29 [ samsel ] , our sample includes both bright early - type galaxies with bulges , and many disk - dominated galaxies of late hubble types , while samples in earlier studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we find 553 bars among 1144 moderately inclined disk galaxies .",
    "hence , the optical @xmath5-band bar fraction , averaged over our sample , which is biased toward late - type disk dominated galaxies , is @xmath106 .",
    "this number could be a lower limit , due to missing weak bars with isophotal twists .",

    "however , as discussed in @xmath29  5.4 , the maximum ellipticity or bar strength is on average higher in faint quasi - bulgeless galaxies than in galaxies with bulges ( see figure [ visp2]d ) .    in order to be able to normalize the bar size",
    ", we determine the isophotal radius , at which the surface brightness reaches 24 mag / arcsec@xmath42 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "since we are using @xmath5-band images , this radius corresponds roughly to @xmath114 , the radius , where the @xmath37-band surface brightness reaches 25 mag / arcsec@xmath42 . in figure",
    "[ r24]a we plot @xmath113 versus the bar size .",
    "there is no strong correlation between these two parameters , however , the bar length is typically much smaller than @xmath113 .",
    "figure [ r24]b shows the ratio @xmath115 versus the absolute @xmath116-band magnitude .",
    "most objects have values in the range 0.2 to 0.4 ( median 0.32 ) , which is consistent with the results of mj07 and @xcite .",
    "theory predicts that the bar ends between the 4:1 and the corotation resonance ( cr ) .",
    "furthermore , studies of the pattern speeds of bars suggest that the bar ends very near the cr , as they find that the ratios between the bar length and the cr are in the range 0.7 to 0.9 @xcite .",
    "if these values are representative , then our result that @xmath115 is primarily well below 1 , suggests that the cr lies well inside @xmath113 in most disks .",
    "the large number of disk galaxies in our sample allows us to perform for the first time a statistically significant study of the dependence of the bar fraction on other galaxy properties , such as luminosity , measures of bulge - to - disk ( @xmath14 ) ratios , size , colors , surface brightness , etc . in effect",
    ", we can bin the data as a function of different parameters with up to 100 galaxies in each bin .",
    "we note that this was not possible in earlier studies , which have total sample sizes of @xmath118 galaxies .",
    "our study can therefore help to understand , which galaxies are more likely to form or maintain a bar and how the presence of a bar relates to the evolution of a galaxy .",
    "for all the results presented in this paper , we omit objects with half light radii @xmath119 kpc .",
    "as we will show in @xmath29 [ visual ] , this regime is strongly contaminated by non - disk galaxies , such as dwarf spheroidals . without these galaxies",

    "we show the optical @xmath5-band bar fraction ( @xmath7 ) as a function of specific galaxy properties . in all panels",
    "the numbers next to the points indicate the total number of objects in the corresponding bins .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the total optical bar fraction ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "we only plot bins with more than 10 objects .",
    "figure [ barf]a shows the optical @xmath5-band bar fraction as a function of the half - light radius ( @xmath12 ) derived from the single - component 2d srsic fit ( @xmath29 [ samsel ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath12 encloses half of the total light of the galaxy and is a measure of the central light concentration of the galaxy .",
    "figure [ barf]a shows that the optical bar fraction rises steadily , from @xmath3  40%50% in galaxies with small @xmath12 ( 23 kpc ) to @xmath3  60% for galaxies with large @xmath12 ( @xmath121 kpc ) . at a given luminosity , galaxies with a large bulge - to - disk ( @xmath14 ) ratio typically have a smaller @xmath12 than disk - dominated galaxies with no bulge or only a very low @xmath14 . at this point ,",
    "one may be tempted to ask whether the drop in the optical @xmath5-band bar fraction in figure [ barf]a , as @xmath12 drops from 4 to 2 kpc , is due to the bar being too small to be detected .",
    "this is not the case because _ @xmath12 is not equivalent to the size of the disk or bar component_. in particular , galaxies with a large @xmath14 and low @xmath12 may have an extended disk and a large bar .",
    "this is shown in figures [ bsize]a and [ bsize]b , where @xmath12 is plotted against the bar semi major axis @xmath122 for 2 redshift bins .",
    "it is evident that for @xmath123  2 to 4 kpc , @xmath122 ranges from 1 to 5 kpc , and is easily resolved .",
    "thus , the trend in optical bar fraction with @xmath12 in figure [ barf]a seems to be a solid one .",
    "we further investigate this below using @xmath124 .    in figure [ barf]b , we plot the optical bar fraction as a function of the normalized @xmath12 , using @xmath13 as normalization . at a given luminosity , @xmath124 is a measure of the relative light distribution in the bulge and disk , and hence a rough measure of the @xmath14 light ratio .",
    "the ratio @xmath117 is not correlated to @xmath125 ( not shown ) .",
    "figure [ barf]b is very similar to figure [ barf]a , also showing a steep increase of the bar fraction towards larger , more extended galaxies .",
    "in fact , the effect is more pronounced in figure [ barf]b , where the optical bar fraction reaches only @xmath17 for the most compact disks and rises to more than @xmath126 for the most extended disks .",
    "this shows that the increase in bar fraction is not primarily a luminosity effect , but is related to the structure of the disk .",
    "therefore , figure [ barf]b can be interpreted as indicating that the _ optical bar fraction is higher in disk - dominated systems_. visual classification , as discussed in detail in @xmath29 [ visual ] , confirms this interpretation .    in figure [ barf]c , @xmath7 is roughly constant at @xmath127 mag ( neglecting the brightest bin , which is very small ) and increases towards the fainter end of the magnitude range , reaching almost @xmath126 for the faintest bin .",
    "this is consistent with the above interpretation of a higher bar fraction in disk - dominated galaxies , since the latter dominate at fainter magnitudes .    in figure [ barf]d we plot the optical @xmath5-band bar fraction as a function of @xmath59 color .",
    "notice the sharp increase in bar fraction as the @xmath59 color gets bluer from 0.55 to 0.30 .",
    "there are 2 potential interpretations of this trend .",
    "one interpretation is that star - forming galaxies host an excess of bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the star formation is bar - induced . however , looking at the @xmath116-band images of our sample galaxies , we do not find that barred late - type disks show more centrally concentrated star formation than unbarred galaxies .",
    "another more likely interpretation is that the higher optical bar fraction in late - type , disk - dominated galaxies , suggested by figure [ barf]b , naturally leads to a higher optical bar fraction for bluer colors , because late - type galaxies tend to be bluer and have higher specific star formation rates @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xmath29  5.6 and figure [ split ] further support this interpretation .",
    "the fact that the relationship between optical bar fraction and blue colors has not been reported in earlier studies ( mj07 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is likely due to the fact that their samples were dominated by brighter earlier - type galaxies , while ours has a large number of late - type disk - dominated galaxies ( @xmath29 [ samsel ] ) .      in figure [ normfcsb]a , we plot @xmath7 as a function of the srsic index @xmath54",
    ". the low @xmath7 for @xmath129  2.5 are likely due to blue spheroids contaminating the color - selected sample of disk galaxies ( see also figure [ cuts ] ) .",
    "the rise in @xmath7 at @xmath130  1.5 is consistent with a larger bar fraction in disk - dominated systems .    in order to further investigate the assumption that the bar fraction is related to the presence and size of a bulge",
    ", we measure the central surface brightnesses ( @xmath128 ) of the galaxies directly on the @xmath5-band images .",
    "this is an important test as the measurement of @xmath128 provides a measure of the central light concentration , which is _ model - independent _ and not affected by the bar itself .",
    "in contrast , the half light radius @xmath12 was derived from a srsic fit , and it is possible that parameters , such as @xmath12 or @xmath113 , are affected by the details of the fit or the presence of a bar .",
    "for instance , bars dominating the light distribution in disks could automatically lead to larger @xmath12 and @xmath113 , because they efficiently disperse the luminosity . this would , however , only be the case in galaxies , where the bar is much more luminous than the bulge and the underlying disk .",
    "we measured @xmath128 on the same physical size ( 1 kpc@xmath42 ) for all galaxies . in figure",
    "[ normfcsb]b , we plot the optical bar fraction as a function of @xmath128 .",
    "the bar fraction is steadily rising for decreasing @xmath128 .",
    "this result is similar to the ones for @xmath12 and @xmath117 .",
    "however , the change of the bar fraction with respect to @xmath128 is less steep , but more continuous .",
    "this result lends support to the view that bars are more likely to be found in disks with relatively small bulges .      in @xmath29 [ bfp ] and [ ertest ] , we interpreted the higher optical bar fraction at larger @xmath12 ( figure [ barf]a ) and @xmath12/@xmath13 ( figure [ barf]b ) as meaning that disk - dominated galaxies with very low bulge - to - disk ( @xmath14 ) ratio have a higher optical bar fraction . the most rigorous way to test",
    "this claim is to perform 3 component bulge+bar+disk decomposition on the 2d light distribution of the galaxy , and derive a @xmath14 .",
    "however , this task is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "instead , we perform a first order test by visually classifying @xmath131 of our sample , which includes galaxies with @xmath12 in the range 2 to 10 kpc . our main goal in this visual classification is to identify late - type disk - dominated galaxies with no significant bulge , as well as early - type galaxies with bulge and disk components , so that we can compare their bar fractions .",
    "we also classify the sub - group of systems with @xmath119 kpc , which we excluded from our sample in @xmath29 [ bfp ] , on the ground that this group is strongly contaminated by pure bulge / spheroidal galaxies , such as dwarf spheroidals or dwarf ellipticals .",
    "a secondary goal of the visual classification is to identify pure bulge systems and verify that they indeed cluster at @xmath119 kpc .",
    "visual inspection does not allow one to classify galaxies in fine grids of @xmath14 ratios , but it does allow one to reliably classify galaxies into three broad visual classes ( vcs ) :    class 1 : : :    pure bulge or spheroid : steady decrease of the surface brightness from    the center outward , with no obvious break in the surface brightness    profile class 2 : : :    disk galaxy with bulge class 3 : : :    pure disk with no bulge : no bright , distinct , and roughly round    central object    the classification has been performed by all three authors , making sure that each object is classified by at least two classifiers . a small fraction of the objects have been classified twice to test the robustness of the results .",
    "the agreement between classifiers is very good ( @xmath132 ) and the final result represents an average of all classifications . in figure",
    "[ i m a ] we show images of 16 representative objects .",
    "the galaxies in the first row have been classified as pure spheroids ( class 1 ) , objects in row two and three are in class 2 , and the fourth row shows examples of pure disks ( class 3 ) .",
    "the first result of our visual classification is that our sample of 1144 disk galaxies ( with @xmath76 ) , which was color selected ( @xmath29 [ samsel ] ) , only has a small contamination of @xmath81 by pure spheroids ( class 1 ) .",
    "many of these objects in class 1 are relatively blue and faint",
    ". these objects could be dwarf ellipticals , which experienced a recent episode of star formation and whose luminosity is therefore dominated by rather blue stars .",
    "it is also interesting to note that almost all of these objects have @xmath57 and would also have been included in our sample of disk galaxies if we had used a srsic cut to select the sample ( e.g. , see figure [ cuts ] ) .",
    "the main point to note is that the small fraction ( @xmath81 ) of class 1 objects would not have any significant impact on our globally - averaged results , such as the global optical bar fraction ( @xmath29 [ glob ] ) .",
    "however , the contamination particularly affects the results in the lowest @xmath119 kpc bin as @xmath133 of the class 1 ( pure spheroids ) objects are very compact and fall in this bin .",
    "this results in a spheroid contamination of up to @xmath134 for objects with @xmath119 kpc , which makes the bar fraction for this subsample very uncertain .",
    "thus , throughout this paper ( @xmath29 [ bfp ] onward ) , we excluded all objects with @xmath119 kpc from the plots and subsequent analysis .",
    "we estimate that the contamination by spheroids for the remaining sample is @xmath135 .",
    "next , we discuss the galaxies that are visually classified as class 2 ( bulge+disk ) and class 3 ( bulgeless ) galaxies . in the sample of 886 galaxies with @xmath136 kpc ,",
    "@xmath20 of galaxies fall in class 3 ( bulgeless ) , while the remaining fall in class 2 .",
    "it is remarkable that _ the optical bar fraction of the class 3 ( bulgeless ) disk galaxies is @xmath137 , compared to @xmath138 for class 2 ( bulge+disk ) galaxies .",
    "_ this striking difference supports the basic conclusion of @xmath29 [ bfp ] and [ ertest ] : _ disk - dominated galaxies with no bulge or a very low @xmath14 display a much higher optical bar fraction than galaxies with significant bulges_. in fact , it appears that a pure disk is twice as likely to be barred than a disk galaxy with a bulge .",
    "we note that the higher bar fraction found for class 3 objects is also consistent with the high bar fractions in late - type galaxies reported by @xcite and @xcite based on rc3 visual bar classes and rc3 hubble types .",
    "another way to illustrate the results is to look at the difference in disk properties between barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "figure [ visp ] shows the percentage of class 3 ( bulgeless ) and class 2 ( bulge+disk ) galaxies among barred galaxies ( solid histograms ) and unbarred galaxies ( dashed histogram ) .",
    "the fraction of bulgeless galaxies in much higher ( @xmath139 vs @xmath140 ) in barred than unbarred systems . figures [ visp2]a and b show the distributions of @xmath12/@xmath13 among barred galaxies ( solid histograms ) and unbarred galaxies ( dashed histograms ) for galaxies brighter than the median luminosity of the sample ( a ) and for galaxies fainter than the median ( b ) .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with large @xmath12/@xmath13 ratios is higher in barred than unbarred systems , particularly for the fainter subsample .",
    "figures [ visp2]c and d show the distributions of bar ellipticities for galaxies in class 3 ( solid histograms ) and galaxies in class 2 ( dashed histograms ) , again for the bright and faint subsamples .",
    "these figures indicate that the bars in bulge - dominated galaxies are generally weaker than in disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "it seems that the presence of a bulge weakens the bar , in particular in fainter galaxies ( panel d ) .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that @xmath79 has been determined including the bulges and that the measured bar ellipticities may be affected by the bulges , in the cases where the end of the bar is close to the bulge .    in summary ,",
    "the visual classifications have provided two important results .",
    "they show that the contamination from non - disk galaxies is small and confined to the regime @xmath119 kpc .",
    "these galaxies do not impact our result as the regime @xmath119 kpc is excluded from all analysis in this paper .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , the visual classifications support the claim , made in @xmath29 [ bfp ] and [ ertest ] , that disk - dominated galaxies with a very low @xmath14 display a significantly higher optical bar fraction ( 60% to 70% ) than galaxies with a significant bulge ( 40% to 50% ) .",
    "the associated ramifications are discussed in @xmath29 [ discu ] .",
    "the mass of galaxy disks is one of the fundamental parameters controlling their evolution .",
    "we use the prescription of @xcite to derive stellar mass - to - light ratios using the @xmath59 color : @xmath141 this mass - to - light ratio is then used to derive the stellar masses of the galaxies using the following relation : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the absolute @xmath5-band magnitude of the sun .",
    "the optical bar fraction as a function mass is shown in figure [ massp ] . over the mass range @xmath144 to @xmath145 @xmath146 ,",
    "the optical bar fraction rises for lower masses .",
    "this trend is expected from our earlier findings ( @xmath29 [ bfp ] and [ ertest ] ) of a higher optical bar fraction in galaxies , which are more disk - dominated , less centrally concentrated , bluer , and fainter .      in @xmath29 [ bfp ] to [ fmass ] , we showed that the optical bar fraction rises with lower bulge - to - disk ratios , as characterized visually ( figure [ visp ] ) and also via @xmath12/@xmath13 ( figure [ barf]b ) ; with lower central surface brightness ( figure [ normfcsb]b ) , and with bluer @xmath59 colors ( figure [ barf]d ) .",
    "there is also a weaker trend with fainter absolute magnitude @xmath147 ( figure [ barf]c ) and with lower masses ( figure [ massp ] ) .",

    "a similar fraction of 15% for bulgeless galaxies was reported in the study of inclined disks by @xcite .",
    "another aspect of bulge formation not usually addressed by hierarchical models is the formation of disky bulges with high @xmath150/@xmath151 ( or ` pseudobulges ' ) .",
    "there are significant differences between classical bulges and disky bulges .",

    "our results show that more bars are present in late - type disks where typically disky ` pseudobulges ' lie , a fact consistent with a bar - driven origin for ` pseudobulges ' .",
    "one of the main results of our study is that the optical bar fraction rises from @xmath107 in early - type galaxies to a significantly higher value ( @xmath152 ) in late - type galaxies , which appear quasi - bulgeless , and seem to have a low bulge to disk ( @xmath14 ) ratio , as measured by @xmath12/@xmath13 , and confirmed by visual inspection .",
    "the optical bar fraction shows a similar but shallower trend with mass , rising in low mass galaxies ( figure [ massp ] ) .",
    "our conclusion is also supported by @xcite , who finds that the frequency of bars roughly doubles from sc to sm galaxies , using the rc3 bar classifications and hubble types .    in this section ,",
    "we discuss how our findings can be interpreted in the context of bar formation scenarios .",
    "as one moves from early / intermediate type galaxies ( e.g. , sa to sc ) to late - type ( e.g. , sd , sm ) systems , several important properties change : the gas mass fraction in the disk rises , the @xmath14 ratio falls , and the total mass falls .",
    "in addition , it is also found that the dark matter ( dm ) fraction rises in lower luminosity systems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , but the scatter in such relations is large @xcite . how do these changes along the hubble sequence impact the susceptibility of a disk to form bars and the subsequent bar evolution ?",
    "the higher gas mass fraction present in late - type disks makes the disk dynamically cold and lowers the toomre @xmath153 parameter @xcite , defined as @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the disk mass surface density , @xmath151 is the gas velocity dispersion , and @xmath56 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "a low @xmath153 ( e.g. , @xmath156  2 to 3 ) favors the onset of bar instabilities and allows strong amplification in the context of the swing amplifier @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the swing amplifier @xcite model may be relevant for bar formation .",
    "in such a scenario , a bar forms via a resonant cavity of swing amplifying spiral density waves that reflect off the center and the corotation radius . one way to suppress bar formation in this model is to introduce an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , which absorbs the spiral density waves , thereby killing the feedback loop .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that a disk with a sharp central density is completely stable to bar formation . in the context of the swing amplifier",
    ", a late - type galaxy with a low @xmath14 ratio would have a shallow rotation curve , and may not harbor an ilr , thus favoring bar formation .",
    "the dm halo can have a large impact on the growth of a bar .",
    "the early work of @xcite suggested that the presence of a dynamically important unresponsive dm halo can suppress the bar instability in a disk galaxy .",
    "however , the evolution of a bar is a highly non - linear process , which depends on the exchange of angular momentum with the outer disk and the dm halo via resonances ( e.g. , weinberg 1985 ; athanassoula 2002 , 2003 ; debattista & sellwood 1998 , 2000 ; berentzen , shlosman , & jogee 2006 ; berentzen , shlosman , & martinez - valpuesta 2007 ) .",
    "work with live halos has showed that there is resonant transfer of angular momentum between the bar , the dm halo , and the outer disk ( e.g. , debattista & sellwood 1998 , 2000 ; athanassoula 2002 ; 2003 ) : the angular momentum absorbed by the dm halo makes an existing bar grow and slow down .",
    "in fact , in the simulations with live halos of @xcite , a strong bar grows even in disks whose dm halo mass within the optical radius exceeds that of the disk mass .",
    "it should also be noted that even if the dark matter only becomes important outside the bar radius , it can still interact with outer resonances in the bar potential , causing the bar to grow .",
    "thus , it appears that the larger dark matter fraction in late - type disks would favor the growth of a bar , if one already exists .",
    "it still remains unclear , however , whether a massive dm halo would promote the formation of a bar in the case of an unbarred disk .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the dm halo ( triaxial or axisymmetric ) also has an important impact ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that cosmological simulations of galactic disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show extensive bar - forming activity , but there has not been any specific prediction of how the bar fraction would vary as a function of hubble type .",
    "it is also important to consider whether our results could be explained in terms of the evolution and destruction of bars rather than their initial formation .",
    "most simulations @xcite indicate that _ present - day _ bars are relatively robust against the type of central mass concentrations ( cmcs ) and @xmath14 that exist in _ present - day _ galaxies today or in the recent past ( see also the discussion in @xmath29  [ impl ] ) . specifically , as outlined in @xcite and @xcite , the super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , central , dense stellar clusters , gaseous concentrations , and inner parts of bulges , which exist in present - day galaxies , fail significantly to generate the required cmcs for bar destruction .",
    "this does not exclude , however , the possibility that at very early epochs ( e.g. , @xmath157 ) when disks were still assembling , the different prevailing physical conditions ( e.g. , large cmcs and gas inflows ) might destroy bars ( e.g. , bournaud et al . 2005 , but see debattista et al 2006 ; heller , shlosman , & athanassoula 2007 ) .",
    "lenses , which are preferentially found in early - type disks @xcite , are sometimes interpreted as dissolving bars . within this framework , our results of a higher optical bar fraction of bars in quasi - bulgeless",
    ", late - type galaxies may reflect the fact that bars in early - type galaxies were destroyed more frequently during their earlier assembly .",
    "we note that in our study , the bar maximum ellipticity is on average higher in faint quasi - bulgeless galaxies than in galaxies with bulges ( figure [ visp2]d ) .",
    "the evolution of the optical bar fraction with redshift is a subject of active study .",
    "early small studies reported that the optical fraction of bars shows a striking decline at @xmath158 @xcite , and undergoes a dramatic order of magnitude decline from @xmath159 to below @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies @xcite ruled out a dramatic order of magnitude decline , and reported a fairly constant optical fraction of strong bars or prominent bars ( @xmath161 to 30% ) over @xmath162 to 1.0 ( look - back times of 3 to 8 gyr ) . the results of such studies allowed , within the error bars , for modest factors of @xmath28 variation in the optical fraction of strong bars or of all bars . for example , for bright ( @xmath163 ) disks ,",
    "@xcite find a rest - frame optical fraction of strong ( @xmath164  0.4 ) bars of @xmath3  36%  @xmath165  6% at @xmath166 , and @xmath3  24%  @xmath165  4% at @xmath167 , allowing a range of 42% to 20% for the optical fraction of strong bars , and yielding an average values of @xmath3  30% .",
    "a similar result was found for the completeness cut of @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "however , not much weight was given to a possible factor of @xmath28 variation due to the small number statistics and due to redshift - dependent systematic effects that may cause an artificial loss of optical bars in the higher redshift bins .",
    "these include the increasing obscuration by dust and star formation , with the average star formation rate increasing by a factor of @xmath169 over @xmath170 to 0.8 ( jogee et al . 2007 ) , the degradation of the psf ( @xmath171 ) from 300 to 680 pc , and the surface brightness dimming by a factor of 5 from @xmath170 to 0.8 .",
    "recent studies using cosmos data @xcite with a significantly larger sample of bright ( massive ( @xmath172 ) galaxies report a moderate decline by a factor of 2 or 3 in the optical fraction of strong bars ( from @xmath173 at @xmath170 to @xmath174 at @xmath68  0.8 ) .",
    "they also report a decline in the optical fraction of ( strong+weak ) bars from @xmath175 at @xmath21 to @xmath176 at @xmath177 .",
    "if this decline is not caused by the afore mentioned redshift - dependent systematic effects , it implies that the frequency of both strong and weak bars is lower at earlier times .",
    "we can compare our globally - averaged optical bar fraction at @xmath21 ( @xmath29 [ glob ] ) to the results at intermediate redshifts , but it is critical to note two things .",
    "firstly , these studies are carried out in the rest - frame _ optical _ band and therefore should be compared to the _ optical _ bar fraction at @xmath21 .",
    "secondly , comparisons should be made for galaxies of the same luminosity or / and mass range .",
    "we first compare the sdss results with the study by @xcite on strong bars , where they find a rest - frame optical fraction of strong ( @xmath178 ) bars of @xmath3  36%  @xmath165  6% at @xmath166 , and @xmath3  24%  @xmath165  4% at @xmath167 .",
    "if we restrict our sample to galaxies with @xmath179 mag and only consider bars that are strong ( ellipticity @xmath180 ) and large enough ( semi - major axis @xmath181 kpc ) to be characterized via ellipse - fitting out to @xmath177 , we get an optical @xmath5-band fraction for strong bars of @xmath182 .",
    "( for @xmath183 , a value of 31% is obtained , but number statistics are low and based on only 54 galaxies ) .",
    "the value of 34% is only slightly higher , by a factor of 1.4 , compared to the value of @xmath3  24%  @xmath165  4% seen in the higher redshift bin ( @xmath167 ) of the @xcite study .",
    "thus , we find that once the loss of bars due to poor resolution is taken into account , the data are consistent with the optical fraction of strongly barred galaxies suffering at most a decline by a factor of @xmath184 out to @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , as discussed in mj07 , if one assumes a further modest loss of optical bars due to increasing obscuration , the data may even allow for a rise in the total fraction of strong bars out to @xmath23 .",
    "the study by @xcite focuses on massive and bright galaxies , with masses in the range @xmath185 to @xmath186 @xmath146 , and @xmath187 in the range @xmath188 to @xmath189 mag .",
    "the sdss sample of 2000 disk galaxies over @xmath88 to 0.03 has very few such bright galaxies ( figures [ magd ] and [ barf]c ) , and thus a comparison over the same luminosity range is not possible .",
    "however , we can compare the optical bar fraction over the mass range @xmath185 to @xmath190 @xmath146 , where the sdss and @xcite data overlap .",
    "the sdss - based optical bar fraction over this mass range is @xmath191 over @xmath192 to 0.03 .",
    "this is similar to the value of @xmath175 in the first redshift bin ( @xmath193 to 0.37 ) of the @xcite study . if we consider only bars that are large enough ( semi - major axis @xmath194 kpc ) to be reliably characterized via ellipse - fitting out to @xmath177 , the sdss - based optical bar fraction falls from @xmath191 to @xmath195 . for comparison ,",
    "the optical bar fraction is @xmath196 in the last bin ( @xmath197 to 0.84 ) .",
    "thus , once the loss of bars due to poor resolution is taken into account , the observed value of @xmath196 is consistent with the optical bar fraction declining by at most a factor of ( 39%/25% ) or @xmath198 over this mass range .",
    "we have used the @xmath5-band images from the nyu - vagc of a sample of 3692 galaxies with @xmath1 mag and redshift @xmath2 to find and characterize bars . while most studies of bars in the local universe have been based on relatively small samples that are dominated by bright early type ( sa to sc ) galaxies with bulges ,",
    "the present sample also includes many galaxies that are disk - dominated and of late hubble types .",
    "furthermore , the sample is @xmath3  10 times larger and samples a larger volume than earlier local samples we used a color cut in the color - magnitude diagram to select @xmath4 disk galaxies .",
    "we cross - check that srsic cuts would yield a similar sample .",
    "we identify and characterize bars and disks using @xmath5-band images and a method based on ellipse fits and quantitative criteria . the typical seeing ( @xmath49 or 290 to 840 pc over @xmath2 ) is adequate for resolving large - scale bars , whose typical diameters are @xmath50 2 kpc",
    ". smaller nuclear bars are not the focus of this study . after the standard procedure of excluding highly inclined ( @xmath6 ) systems , we find the following results .    1",
    ".   the average optical @xmath5-band bar fraction ( @xmath7 ) in our sample , which primarily consists of late - type disk - dominated galaxies , is @xmath8 .",
    "the bars have diameters @xmath9 of 2 to 24 kpc , with most ( @xmath10 ) having @xmath11 2 to 6 kpc ( figure [ barp]a ) .",
    "the bar length is typically much smaller than @xmath113 ( figure [ r24]a ) and most galaxies have a @xmath115 in the range 0.2 to 0.4 ( figure [ r24]b ) .",
    "when galaxies are separated according to normalized @xmath12/@xmath13 , which is a measure of the bulge - to - disk ( @xmath14 ) ratio , a remarkable result is seen : the optical @xmath5-band fraction rises sharply , from @xmath3  40% in galaxies that have small @xmath12/@xmath13 and visually appear bulge - dominated , to @xmath3  70% for galaxies that have large @xmath12/@xmath13 .",
    "visual classification of @xmath131 of our sample ( with @xmath76 ) confirms our result that _ late - type disk - dominated galaxies with no bulge or a very low @xmath14 display a significantly higher optical bar fraction ( @xmath16% vs 40% ) than galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "_ it also shows that barred galaxies host a larger fraction ( 31% vs 5% ) of quasi - bulgeless disk - dominated galaxies than do unbarred galaxies .",
    "the bar ellipticities or strengths are on average higher in faint disk - dominated galaxies than in bulge - dominated galaxies ( figure [ visp2]d ) .",
    "similar trends in the optical bar fraction are found using the central surface brightness and color .",
    "bluer galaxies have higher bar fractions ( @xmath199 at @xmath200 ) than the redder objects ( @xmath201 at @xmath202 ) ( figure [ barf]d ) .",
    "the optical @xmath5-band fraction also shows a slight rise for galaxies with fainter luminosities ( figure [ barf]c ) and lower masses ( figure [ massp ] ) .",
    "this is expected from ( 2 ) , given that late - type galaxies are fainter , bluer , and less massive .",
    "the significant rise in the optical bar fraction toward disk - dominated galaxies is discussed in terms of their higher gas mass fraction , higher dark matter fraction , and lower bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "while many hierarchical @xmath19cdm models of galaxy evolution models fail to produce galaxies without classical bulges , our study finds that in the range @xmath1 mag and redshift @xmath2 , @xmath20 of the 1144 moderately inclined disk galaxies appear to be `` quasi - bulgeless '' , without a classical bulge .",
    "our study of bars at @xmath21 in the optical @xmath5 band provides a reference @xmath21 baseline for intermediate redshift @xmath22 acs surveys that trace bars in _",
    "bright _ disks in the rest - frame optical bands ( @xmath203 ) out to @xmath23 . by applying the same cutoffs in magnitude , bar ellipticity ( @xmath204 ) , and bar size ( @xmath205 kpc ) , which are applied in @xmath26 studies in order to trace strong bars with adequate spatial resolution in bright disks",
    ", we obtain an optical @xmath5-band fraction for strong bars of @xmath27 .",
    "this is comparable to the values of @xmath17 at @xmath26 , @xmath3  36%  @xmath165  6% at @xmath166 , and @xmath3  24%  @xmath165  4% at @xmath167 .",
    "our result implies that the optical fraction of strong bars in bright galaxies does not suffer any dramatic order of magnitude decline out to @xmath68  1 .",

    "<S> we present a study of large - scale bars in the local universe , based on a large sample of @xmath0 galaxies , with @xmath1 mag and redshift @xmath2 , drawn from the sloan digitized sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> while most studies of bars in the local universe have been based on relatively small samples that are dominated by bright galaxies of early to intermediate hubble types with prominent bulges , the present sample is @xmath3  10 times larger , covers a larger volume , and includes many galaxies that are disk - dominated and of late hubble types . </S>",
    "<S> both color cuts and srsic cuts yield a similar sample of @xmath4 disk galaxies . we characterize bars and disks by ellipse - fitting @xmath5-band images and applying quantitative criteria . after excluding highly inclined ( @xmath6 ) systems , we find the following results . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 )  the optical @xmath5-band fraction ( @xmath7 ) of barred galaxies , when averaged over the whole sample , is @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the bars have diameters @xmath9 of 2 to 24 kpc , with most ( @xmath10 ) having @xmath11 2 to 6 kpc . ( 2 )  when galaxies are separated according to half light radius ( @xmath12 ) , or normalized @xmath12/@xmath13 , which is a measure of the bulge - to - disk ( @xmath14 ) ratio , a remarkable result is seen : @xmath7 rises sharply , from @xmath3  40% in galaxies that have small @xmath12/@xmath13 and visually appear to host prominent bulges , to @xmath3  70% for galaxies that have large @xmath12/@xmath13 and appear disk - dominated . </S>",
    "<S> visual classification , performed for @xmath15 galaxies , confirms our result that disk - dominated galaxies with no bulge or a very low @xmath14 display a significantly higher optical bar fraction ( @xmath16% vs 40% ) than galaxies with prominent bulges . </S>",
    "<S> it also shows that barred galaxies host a larger fraction ( 31% vs 5% ) of quasi - bulgeless disk - dominated galaxies than do unbarred galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 )  @xmath7 rises for galaxies with bluer colors ( by @xmath17 ) and lower masses ( by @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) the significant rise in the optical bar fraction toward late - type galaxies is discussed in terms of their higher gas mass fraction , higher dark matter fraction , and lower bulge - to - disk ratio . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) while hierarchical @xmath19cdm models of galaxy evolution models fail to produce galaxies without classical bulges , our study finds that @xmath20 of disk galaxies appear to be `` quasi - bulgeless '' . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 )  our study of bars at @xmath21 in the optical @xmath5-band provides the @xmath21 comparison point for @xmath22 acs surveys ( e.g. , gems , goods , cosmos ) that measure the rest - frame optical bar fraction in bright galaxies out to @xmath23 . after applying the same cutoffs in magnitude , bar ellipticity ( @xmath24 ) , and bar size ( @xmath25 kpc ) , which are applied in @xmath26 studies in order to trace strong bars with adequate spatial resolution in bright disks </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an optical @xmath5-band bar fraction of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to the value reported at @xmath26 , implying that the optical fraction of strong bars does not suffer a dramatic order of magnitude decline in bright galaxies out to @xmath23 . </S>"
