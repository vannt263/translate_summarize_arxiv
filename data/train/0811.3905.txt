    "recently the transverse distribution of particle production from strong constant chromo - electric fields has been explicitly calculated in ref .   for soft - gluon production and in ref .",
    "for quark ( antiquark ) production .",
    "this particle production method , originally discussed by heisenberg and euler  @xcite , schwinger  @xcite and weisskopf  @xcite , has a long history as a model of the production of the quark gluon plasma following a relativistic heavy ion collision  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture considered here is that of two relativistic heavy nuclei colliding and leaving behind a semi - classical gluon field which then non - perturbatively produces gluon and quark - antiquark pairs via the schwinger mechanism  @xcite . at high energy",
    "large hadron colliders , such as rhic ( au - au collisions at @xmath3 = 200 gev )  @xcite and lhc ( pb - pb collisions at @xmath3 = 5.5 tev )  @xcite , about half the total center - of - mass energy , @xmath4 , goes into the production of a semi - classical gluon field  @xcite , which can be thought to be initially in a lorentz contracted disc .",
    "the gluon field in su(3 ) is described by two casimir invariants , the first one , @xmath5 , being related to the energy density of the initial field , whereas the second one , @xmath1 ^ 2 $ ] , is related to the su(3 ) color hypercharge left behind by the leading particles .",
    "so the question we want to study in this short note is how sensitive the transverse distribution is to this second casimir invariant @xmath2 . in a future paper",
    "we will discuss how the results for the transverse distribution are modified by the back reaction problem for the chromo - electric field .",
    "some of the history of previous work on pair production in qcd is found in the papers of  @xcite .",

    "the difference in sign in the logarithm between the gluon distribution and the quark distribution is related to bose _ vs. _",

    "we find that in the quark case , because of the quark mass , the forward production depends on @xmath29 and on @xmath10 , whereas the normalized gluon distribution in the forward direction depends only on @xmath10 for a given initial energy density .",
    "the value of @xmath29 can be estimated from the initial center - of - mass energy of the colliding ions , and the volume of the lorentz contracted nuclei .",
    "for example for gold , @xmath31  fm and at rhic the center - of - mass energy is @xmath32  gev per nucleon .",

    "these values of @xmath10 give the minimum and maximum values for the gluon production rate given in eq .  .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the percentage variation of the magnitude of the normalized ( to the maximum ) distribution in the forward direction for gluon pair production as a function of @xmath10 .",

    "the maximum variation on @xmath10 of the pair production rate occurs in the forward direction and is approximately 15% .",

    "[ fig4 ] we show the percentage variation of the magnitude of the normalized ( to the maximum ) distribution in the forward direction for quark production as a function of @xmath10 . for quarks ,",
    "this quantity depends on both @xmath10 and @xmath29 but becomes independent of @xmath29 as the initial energy density increases at which point the mass of the quark becomes irrelevant .",
    "the maximum value of the quark production rate occurs at the endpoints @xmath37 and @xmath19 . for quarks ,",
    "the maximum percentage variation , which occurs between @xmath18 and @xmath43 is a function of  @xmath29 .",
    "this percentage variation asymptotes as a function of @xmath29 to a value of approximately 13% , as shown in fig .",
    "we have considered the dependence of the pair production rate of quarks and gluons from a strong chromo - electric field and have discovered that the effect of the second casimir invariant of su(3 ) , which was not present in the electric field problem , effects the distribution by less than 15% .",
    "this event by event dependence of the transverse momentum distribution of jets on @xmath2 may be something of interest at heavy ion colliders .",
