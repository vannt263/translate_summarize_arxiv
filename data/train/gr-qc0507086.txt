    ", any initial configuration would decay to the static solution of the wave equation , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the potential of the mirror ; and this static solution is stable under perturbations . in the self - gravitating case we will show there is a critical value of kink potential @xmath4 about which the system displays a classic example of a turning point instability  @xcite , responsible for the above phenomena . above this critical potential",
    ", there are no equilibria and all configurations collapse to a black hole .",
    "the behavior of this system illustrates the remarkable richness of the physical properties that result from the mixture of long range gravitational forces and nonlinearity .",
    "our theoretical model is the null - timelike initial value problem for a spherically symmetric space - time satisfying the coupled einstein - klein - gordon equations for a massless scalar field .",
    "we pose this mixed boundary value problem in the region of space - time outside a timelike inner boundary and to the future of an initial null hypersurface .",
    "the mathematical details of this problem have been described before in an investigation of the decay of scalar wave tails  @xcite . in that case , the scalar field was set to zero on the inner boundary , so that the boundary acted as a perfectly reflecting mirror . here , by holding the inner boundary at a fixed potential , its role as a mirror is unchanged due to the local gauge invariance of the system with respect to the transformation @xmath5 .",
    "however , the potential difference with respect to infinity introduces nontrivial global effects .",
    "we set the geometry of the mirror to correspond to a surface of radius @xmath1 enclosing a flat region of spacetime .",
    "the evolution of the system then depends uniquely upon the characteristic data for the scalar field on the initial null hypersurface , which extends from the mirror to future null infinity @xmath6 .",
    "we describe this system in terms of a null coordinate system with the spherically symmetric line element @xmath7 in these coordinates , the einstein - klein - gordon equations reduce to  @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 and the scalar wave equation @xmath10 , which takes the form @xmath11    the initial null data necessary for evolution consists of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , at initial time @xmath14 .",
    "( we take @xmath15 ) . at the mirror , we set @xmath16 , with the gauge condition that @xmath17 .",
    "we adopt the coordinate condition @xmath18 . the condition that the metric match continuously to a flat interior for @xmath19 requires @xmath20 .",
    "( the normal derivatives of @xmath0 and the metric do not match continuously across @xmath21 in accord with the sheet stresses associated with the mirror ) .    with these conditions",
    "the scalar field and metric components have a unique future evolution .",
    "the resulting metric does not have an asymptotic minkowski form at @xmath6 .",
    "this is characterized by the quantity @xmath22 which relates bondi time @xmath23 at @xmath6 to the proper time @xmath24 at the reflecting boundary according to @xmath25 .",
    "bondi time is the physically relevant time for distant observers .",
    "the bondi mass of the system can be expressed in either an asymptotic or integral form  @xcite : @xmath26 ( note that the mass content of a null hypersurface only depends upon field values in the hypersurface and is independent of their time derivative ) .    in the flat space limit , ( [ eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : v ] )",

    "furthermore , the second variation of the mass about this state is positive , so that it represents a stable equilibrium , which the system approaches after radiating its excess energy to infinity .    in sec.[sec :",
    "energ ] , we show that for small kink potentials these features extend to the curved space , self - gravitating case .",
    "but , above the critical kink potential , equilibria do not exist .",
    "we show that this critical potential marks a turning point instability about which the equilibrium configurations bifurcate into stable and unstable form . in sec.[sec : collap ] , we present numerical simulations of the evolution of stable and unstable kinks .",
    "at the initial retarded time , the null data @xmath39 and the constrained kink potential @xmath40 uniquely determine the future evolution of the system . in order to discuss the energetics of these states",
    "it is convenient to describe the corresponding configuration space in terms of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is considered the independent variable . here",

    "the affine freedom is fixed by the boundary conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where we denote @xmath45 .",
    "then ( [ eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : v ] ) can be reexpressed as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 which determines @xmath49 uniquely in terms of the initial data .",
    "the mass of of the state @xmath50 can be obtained by inserting the solution @xmath49 of ( [ eq : r ] ) into the first version of ( [ eq : mint ] ) , which gives @xmath51 when reexpressed with @xmath42 as the independent variable .      we now show that the asymptotically flat static solution @xmath52 of the einstein - klein - gordon system is an extremum of the energy , subject to a fixed kink potential .",

    ", we obtain for the first variation of the bondi mass @xmath85 but direct calculation gives @xmath86 so that ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) integrates to yield @xmath87 .",
    "thus the static solutions are equilibrium configurations . for sufficiently small values of @xmath60 , the second variation of the bondi mass will be positive , as in the flat space case . in that regime ,",
    "small perturbations can be dissipated by mass loss due to scalar radiation . however ,",
    "if there exists a perturbation which lowers the bondi mass the static equilibria can not be stable since further radiative mass loss would drive the system away from equilibrium .",
    "we next see that this indeed occurs in the strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "the one - parameter family of static equilibria has kink potential @xmath88 , given by ( [ eq : kink ] ) , which increases monotonically with @xmath60 from @xmath89 until it reaches a maximum at the turning point @xmath90 satisfying @xmath91 . above @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath88 monotonically decreases to @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "thus , below @xmath95 , there are two static equilibria for each kink amplitude .",
    "similarly , the mass @xmath96 increases monotonically from @xmath97 to a maximum at the same turning point @xmath92 and then decreases monotonically to the black hole limit , @xmath98 , as @xmath94 .",
    "the quantity @xmath99 , defined by @xmath100 , plays an important role in the stability of this system .",
    "explicitly , @xmath101 denoting @xmath102 , it is easy to verify that @xmath103 for @xmath104 .    these are precisely the criteria for the application of a theorem  @xcite regarding the onset of instability at a turning point in a one - parameter family of equilibria .",
    "we present here a finite dimensional version of the argument behind the theorem as applied to the present case .",
    "proofs for both the finite dimensional and function space cases are given by sorkin  @xcite .",
    "consider then the configuration space @xmath105 whose elements for each choice @xmath106 represent a function @xmath107 with boundary conditions @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 represent the one parameter family of static equilibria , regarding @xmath111 as functions of @xmath60 .",
    "we now show that for some @xmath112 all the equilibria in the range @xmath113 are unstable .    the proof is based upon the equilibrium conditions , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 . differentiating these conditions with respect to @xmath60 along the equilibrium sequence gives @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 represents the second variation of the mass with respect to the perturbation @xmath121 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) implies that @xmath122 at the turning point where @xmath123 , , so that this mode has neutral stability .",
    "taking a further derivative of ( [ eq : mdot ] ) and evaluating at the turning point , we obtain @xmath124 as remarked above , @xmath125 at the turning point so that ( [ eq : deltadot ] ) implies the instability of this mode in a neighborhood @xmath126 .",
    "since there are no other turning points , these general considerations suggest that the equilibria @xmath52 are stable below @xmath92 and unstable above @xmath92 , although the theorem only strictly implies the onset of instability in a neighborhood of @xmath92 . in order to provide further insight",
    ", we now consider specific behavior of the second variation of @xmath127 .    for an arbitrary perturbation , @xmath72 , we can follow the approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : equil ] which led to the expression ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) for the first variation of the mass and proceed further to determine the second variation . at order @xmath128",
    ", this leads to @xmath129 where @xmath81 is given by the integral ( [ eq : deltar ] ) .",
    "because @xmath81 depends nonlocally on the perturbation @xmath130 , ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) does not give straightforward information regarding the sign of the second variation .",
    "however , the first term in the integrand is positive definite and depends locally on the perturbation .",
    "therefore , for perturbations confined to a sufficiently compact region , the first term dominates the @xmath81 term and the second variation is positive .",
    "this leads us to consider large length scale perturbations in the search for unstable modes .",
    "one such perturbation can be obtained from the static solution by combining a change in @xmath60 with a translation , @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 adjusted to set @xmath134 so that the kink potential is held fixed .",
    "this requires @xmath135 for this perturbation , the change in @xmath136 can be worked out analytically to second order ( using maple ) from ( [ eq : wronsk ] ) , although the final expression is too lengthy to present here .",
    "the important point is that the second order variation of @xmath136 is positive for @xmath137 , vanishes precisely for @xmath104 and turns negative in a neighborhood @xmath126 .",
    "this corroborates our expectation that perturbations are stable below @xmath92 and go unstable as we pass through the turning point .",
    "( it is curious that beyond the turning point @xmath138 again becomes positive for values of @xmath60 greater than approximately @xmath139 ) .",
    "we now examine the behavior of this system numerically , using a null cone evolution algorithm for nonlinear scalar waves developed in ref s",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based upon the compactified radial coordinate @xmath140 , so that @xmath6 is represented by a finite grid boundary , with @xmath141 at the mirror and @xmath142 at @xmath6 .",
    "the code has been tested to be globally second order accurate , i.e. the error in global quantities such as the bondi mass is @xmath143 in terms of the grid spacing @xmath144 .    in the case of a mirror boundary at zero potential ( no kink ) , as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , a weak scalar field radiates completely to infinity , so that the final mass of the system is zero .",
    "however , above a critical strength , the scalar field undergoes gravitational collapse to form a horizon . in this case , some of the scalar energy is radiated to infinity and the remainder crosses the horizon and contributes to the final black hole mass .",
    "the mirror itself must fall into the horizon for otherwise it would continue to reflect the scalar field until all scalar energy were radiated to infinity .",
    "near the critical strength , the sensitivity of the final mass is somewhat analogous to the critical behavior studied by choptuik  @xcite , except there is now a mass gap because the final black hole must have a mass larger than @xmath145 in order to contain the mirror . in the present case of a mirror with nonvanishing kink potential",
    ", we would expect this behavior to be modified in several ways .",
    "first , we consider kink potentials @xmath146 . in this case",
    ", two static equilibrium states @xmath147 and @xmath148 are possible , @xmath149 , with the former expected to be stable and the latter unstable .",
    "the double valued behavior of @xmath150 is graphed in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "it shows that @xmath151 .",
    "consequently , the following scenarios are expected .",
    "a state close to @xmath147 should return to @xmath147 but a state close to @xmath148 could either evolve toward @xmath147 or collapse to a black hole .",
    "these scenarios have been confirmed by the following numerical simulations .",
    "( all these simulations are run setting @xmath152 ) .    with kink potential @xmath153 for @xmath154 , we study the stable equilibrium by evolving initial data of the form @xmath155 . for values of @xmath156",

    ", the state @xmath148 makes a transition to the stable state @xmath147 .",
