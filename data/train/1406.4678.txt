    "semi - inclusive deep inelastic production of hadrons in lepton - nucleon collisions plays a key role in the determination of polarized sea quark densities . in the perturbative qcd approach ,",
    "valid in the kinematic region of large momentum transfer to the nucleon , the cross - section to produce a hadron @xmath3 is expressed , in leading order ( lo ) , as a product of parton densities @xmath4 , functions of bjorken-@xmath5 , and fragmentation functions @xmath6 , reflecting the probability of a quark @xmath7 to fragment into the hadron @xmath3 carrying a fraction @xmath2 of its energy .",
    "this factorized form is modified into a convolution when going beyond lo and , of course , the parton densities and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , develop a slow logarithmic dependence on the scale @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the 4-momentum transfer from the lepton to the nucleon .    in studying the latest hermes data on @xmath10 production on protons and deuterons @xcite",
    "we have found that the application of the standard perturbative qcd analysis to the differences of the multiplicities @xmath11 using , as usual , isospin invariance for the ffs , leads to a poor description of the data at low @xmath2 .",
    "relaxing the demand for isospin invariance leads to violations of isospin conservation at a level which is simply not credible .",
    "the violation is biggest at small values of @xmath2 and this has led us to suspect that the apparent violations are an artifact of using the factorized qcd treatment in a kinematic region where it is unjustified . indeed ,",
    "many years ago , berger @xcite proposed criterium for delineating the kinematic regions where the standard approach should be valid , and we have found that for the hermes data , the data bin corresponding to the smallest values of @xmath2 i.e. @xmath12 lies outside berger s safe region , as will be explained in detail in the paper .",
    "the multiplicities @xmath13 of pions using a proton ( deuteron ) target are defined as the number of pions produced , normalized to the number of dis events , and can be expressed in terms of the semi - inclusive cross section @xmath14 and the inclusive cross section @xmath15 : @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ m_exp_th ] ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the semi - inclusive and the usual nucleon structure functions , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are expressed in terms of the unpolarized parton densities and fragmentation functions , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given by the unpolarized parton densities .",
    "it turns out that the pion multiplicities are measured with enough precision so that one can directly extract from their differences @xmath11 the nonsinglet ffs @xmath23 .",
    "knowledge of these is important to test whether the additional assumptions for the favored and unfavored ffs which are usually made in the qcd analyses of the multiplicities @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are or are not correct .    using the charge conjugation invariance of the strong interactions in the case of the pion fragmentation functions @xmath26 and the assumption @xmath27 for the strange unpolarized parton densities , the following expressions for the proton and deuteron semi - inclusive structure functions hold in nlo qcd @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the valence unpolarized parton densities , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the wilson coefficient functions @xcite .",
    "note also that the arguments @xmath33 for the parton densities and @xmath34 for the ffs in the equations above are omitted .",
    "the remarkable properties of these semi - inclusive structure functions are that the gluon fragmentation function does not contribute into the structure functions themselves , nor to the @xmath35 evolution of the nonsinglet quark fragmentation functions @xmath36 .    according to isospin @xmath37 symmetry @xmath38 and then eqs .",
    "( 3 - 6 ) take the following simple form : @xmath39 where the unpolarized valence quark densities @xmath40 and the nonsinglet fragmentation function @xmath41 satisfy the nlo qcd evolution equations .    in lo",
    "qcd approximation the longitudinal proton and deuteron structure functions @xmath42 are equal to zero and we obtain for the differences of the pion multiplicities : @xmath43(x , q^2 ) } , \\label{diff_mplo}\\\\ m_{d}^{\\pi^{+}-\\pi^{-}}(x , q^2,z)&=&\\frac{3(u_v+d_v)(x , q^2)d^ { \\pi^{+}}_{u_{v}}(z , q^2)}{[5(u+\\bar u+d+\\bar d ) + 4s](x , q^2 ) } , \\label{diff_mdlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath44 is used for the nonsinglet fragmentation function @xmath45",
    "so , if isospin symmetry holds we have two independently measured quantities , the multiplicities @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the one nonsinglet fragmentation function @xmath48 which can thus be determined in lo qcd directly and independently from the data at measured values of @xmath35 without using an input parametrization for @xmath48 and its @xmath35 evolution .",
    "in our analysis we have used the @xmath49 $ ] presentation of the hermes proton and deuteron data on pion multiplicities @xcite , corrected for exclusive vector meson production .",
    "the pion multiplicities are given for 4 z - bins [ 0.2 - 0.3 ;  0.3 - 0.4 ;  0.4 - 0.6 ;  0.6 - 0.8 ] as functions of @xmath35 . note that to any measured value of @xmath35 the corresponding value of the bjorken variable @xmath5 is attached .",
    "the total number of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data points for the proton and deuteron targets is 144 , 72 for @xmath50 and 72 for @xmath51 data .",
    "so , there are 36 data points ( 9 for every z - bin ) for the multiplicity @xmath52 , as well as for @xmath53 .      our results on the fragmentation function @xmath54 extracted from the proton data using eq .",

    "1 only the statistical errors of the multiplicities have been taken into account .",
    "the extracted nonsinglet ffs should coincide within the errors . as seen from fig .",

    "blue ( red ) points correspond to the data using a proton ( deuteron ) target , respectively . ]",
    "we have performed the same analysis in nlo qcd using for the nonsinglet semi - inclusive structure functions eqs .",
    "( [ f1p]-[fld ] ) and the nlo qcd expressions for the usual nucleon structure functions ( @xmath55 ) . for the unpolarized pdfs",
    "the nlo mrst02 set @xcite was used . in the nlo case",
    "one can not extract the nonsinglet fragmentation function @xmath48 directly from the data , and we have to parametrize it at some fixed value of @xmath35 .",
    "the following parametrization for @xmath48 at @xmath56 was used : @xmath57 , \\label{duv_parq0}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath58 are free parameters to be determined from the fit to the data .",
    "the double mellin transform technique @xcite has been used to calculate the nonsinglet semi - inclusive structure functions eqs .",
    "( [ f1p]-[fld ] ) from their moments .",
    "we have found that using only the very tiny statistical errors one can not achieve a satisfactory description of the data .",
    "we obtain the following values for @xmath59 per point : @xmath60 from the fit to proton data , @xmath61 from the fit to deuteron data , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 from the _ combined _ fit to the proton and deuteron data on the differences of pion multiplicities @xmath64 .",
    "we would like to mention , however , that the statistical errors for the hermes data are between two and three times smaller than the systematic ones .",
    "so , to obtain reasonable results from the fits to the data , the systematic errors in this case have to be taken into account .    in fig .",
    "2 the best fit curves ( solid lines ) of our nlo qcd _ combined _ fit to the proton and deuteron data on the differences of pion multiplicities using the total errors are compared with the data . the best fit curves ( dashed lines ) obtained from the separate fits to the proton and deuteron data are also presented .",
    "[ ht ]        the numerical results for the combined fit are given in table 1 . while in the case of separate fits to the proton and deuteron data an excellent description for _ all _ z - bins of the proton as well for the deuteron data is achieved:@xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see the dashed curves in fig .",
    "2 ) , in the combined fit to the data the situation is different . a good description of the data",
    "is achieved except for the lower z bins , @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 $ ] , for the deuteron target , for which @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ h ]     symmetry .",
    "the solid curves correspond to the @xmath37 symmetric fit to the same data . ]    as seen from table 2 and fig . 5 ,",
    "a significant improvement in the fit to the deuteron data for the first two z - bins is achieved and a good description of both the proton and deuteron data is obtained . however , as seen from fig . 6 , where the extracted nonsinglet ffs @xmath41 and @xmath71 are presented , the violation of @xmath37 symmetry is at a level , especially for the values of @xmath72 , which is hardly credible .",
    "the relation between the two nonsinglets at @xmath73 obtained from the fit to the data is : @xmath74 remember that when su(2 ) symmetry holds : @xmath75 .",
    "we think that what appears as a non - credible violation of isospin symmetry could be a consequence of using the factorized qcd treatment of the data in kinematic region where it is unjustified . indeed , according to berger",
    "s phenomenological criterium @xcite proposed a long time ago , there is a strong correlation between @xmath76 , the invariant mass of the hadrons @xmath77 produced in the fully inclusive lepton nucleon process @xmath78 , and the region z , where one can clearly separate the quark and target fragmentation effects , i.e. where the hard scattering and the hadronization factorize and the usual factorized qcd treatment is valid .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the smaller the values of z , the larger the values of w have to be for a clean separation between the current and target jets . in @xcite plots ( fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 ) are presented showing the z - values for which it is probably safe to use the factorized approach , for a quark fragmenting into different hadrons @xmath79 , produced in sidis processes , for values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . as seen from these plots , in the case of pions ,",
    "values of @xmath82 are needed for a clean separation of the quark and target fragmentation effects in the data , and an unambiguous extraction of the collinear fragmentation functions @xmath83 for @xmath84 . keeping in mind that",
    "for the hermes data on pion multiplicities in the region @xmath85 the corresponding values of @xmath76 are in the region @xmath86 , one sees that berger s criterium is not satisfied for the smaller values of z , and certainly for the first z - bin , @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that in the @xmath37-symmetry case we have found good agreement between the nonsinglet @xmath41 extracted directly from the data on the differences of the pion multiplicities @xmath11 and that obtained as a difference between the favored @xmath87 and unfavored @xmath88 fragmentation functions extracted from our fit to @xmath89 and @xmath90 data @xcite .",
    "the nonsinglets extracted in these two different ways are shown in fig .",
    "7 ( note that the highest value of @xmath2 for the data is 0.7 ) .",
    "the agreement shown in fig ( 7 ) confirms that the usual assumption about the unfavored fragmentation functions @xmath91 made in our fit @xcite to the @xmath89 and @xmath90 data , is acceptable , but at the same time the agreement is surprising given the problems reported earlier about fitting the deuteron data on the difference of pion multiplicities in the lowest z bins , when imposing isospin invariance .",
    "our nlo _ favored _ and _ unfavored _ pion ffs , extracted from the hermes data on multiplicities @xmath89 and @xmath90 have been discussed in our paper @xcite and compared to those determined by hkns ( hirai , kumano , nagai , sudoh ) @xcite and dss ( de florian , sassot , stratmann ) @xcite which were obtained respectively from the semi - inclusive @xmath92 annihilation data alone , and from the global fit to the semi - inclusive @xmath93 annihilation data , the data on single - inclusive hadron production in hadron - hadron collisions and the _ unpublished _",
    "hermes05 data on semi - inclusive lepto - production of hadrons .    in fig .",
    "8 we compare our nlo nonsinglet fragmentation function @xmath94 extracted _ directly _ from the hermes data on the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities to those of hkns and dss obtained as differences between their favored @xmath87 and unfavored @xmath95 nlo fragmentation functions .",
    "note that in the dss analysis @xmath37- symmetry was broken and eq .",
    "( [ su2 ] ) does not hold .",
    "that is why the nonsinglet fragmentation function @xmath96 for dss is also presented in fig .",
    "8 . as seen from fig .",
    "8 , the discrepancy between the nonsinglets , is significant .",
    "it is important to mention that the semi - inclusive @xmath93 annihilation data give no information how to disentangle qiark @xmath97 from anti - quark @xmath98 fragmentation , and only their sum @xmath99 can be determined from the data , while the important role of the semi - inclusive dis processes is that they allow to separate @xmath100 from @xmath98 .",
    "we think that this is the reason for the large difference between our nonsinglet ff and the hkns one . as for the inconsistency between our and the dss nonsinglet ffs , that is a consequence of the fact that the dss group has used in their analysis the unpublished hermes05 data which are not consistent with the final hermes data which we have used @xcite .    we feel it is important to mention a totally different issue which might be the source of the entire problem in the perturbative qcd description of the hermes data , namely the fact that there appears to be an inconsistency between the two ways hermes has chosen to present their data .",
    "it appears to us that the @xmath101 $ ] and the @xmath49 $ ] presentations are incompatible @xcite .",
    "this could be a signal that maybe there is something wrong with the data .",
