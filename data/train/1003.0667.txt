    "the generic model for radio galaxies assumes that twin jets emanating from an active galactic nucleus propagate outward in two opposite directions . the jets , which initially propagate at a relativistic speed , interact with the surrounding medium leading to formation of a diffuse emission region .",
    "radio galaxies appear to have two classes : low- and high - luminosity radio galaxies , commonly referred to as fr i and ii sources , respectively @xcite .",
    "the jets in high - luminosity radio galaxies have relatively homogeneous morphology ; they are well collimated and propagate through the surrounding medium  initially in the cores , then halos of their parent galaxies and then the intergalactic medium ( igm)creating pair of large lobes .",
    "the jets are dim until the end of the lobes where there are bright hot spots .",
    "classical double radio sources are a typical example of this class .",
    "by contrast , low - luminosity radio galaxies are characterized by jets that are bright close to the nucleus of their parent galaxy .",
    "the jets have diverse morphologies , a feature that can be interpreted as deceleration of jets due to entrainment of the external medium .",
    "the jets are initially laminar near the nucleus and then subject to turbulent disruption when passing through the flare region that is thought to be the main acceleration site for relativistic particles .",
    "the jets beyond the flare region spread out , resembling smoke arising from a chimney mixing with the ambient medium .",
    "the key issues in the understanding of radio galaxies include the evolution of radio galaxies and the underlining physics that distinguishes these two classes .",
    "one suggestion is that these two classes of source are intrinsically different , primarily in their jet dynamics , evolving along different tracks @xcite .",
    "however , there are suggestions that some of the high - luminosity radio sources with weak jets may evolve into low - luminosity sources @xcite .",
    "some radio sources exhibit mixed features of fr is and iis .",
    "for example , there are souces with one - side jet showing the fr i features and the other showing the fr ii features .",
    "this leads to an opinion that such classification may not be clear cut as previously thought @xcite .",
    "it is well accepted that the radio emission in radio galaxies is due to synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons ( or positrons ) injected from the jets .",
    "the total synchrotron power @xmath0 evolves with time as the injection of a mixture of kinetic energy and magnetic energy competes against the losses due to volume expansion and radiation . when the losses dominate , the total power is a decreasing function of time as the source ages .",
    "since the typical evolutionary time scale is @xmath1 , it is not practical to measure how the total power changes in time directly by observations . one may study the temporal evolution of radio galaxies from the total spectral power , @xmath0 , as a function of the source s linear size @xcite .",
    "the linear size here is defined as the dimension of the lobe along the jet axis .",
    "since the linear size @xmath2 increases as the source expands , a radio source should evolve along a particular track in the @xmath0@xmath2 diagram .",
    "there are many discussions in the literature on the time evolution of high - luminosity radio galaxies ( or fr ii sources ) @xcite . in the existing models ,",
    "there are three relevant regions where the physical processes determine the evolution of the source .",
    "these include the hot spots where particles are assumed to be accelerated and radiate , the head region that contains the hot spots , and the lobe  an emission volume inflated by the input of the jet , where relativistic particles are injected and the volume of the emitting plasma expands .",
    "since the hot spots appear at the end of the jet , their distance to the center can be identified as the linear size of the lobe .",
    "thus , the modeling of the time evolution of the lobe size is reduced to the problem of modeling of changes in the location of the hot spots .",
    "one of the widely - discussed models is the self - similar expansion model in which the jet creates a bow shock by sweeping up the ambient material @xcite .",
    "so , the location of the shock is completely determined by the jet power and the density of the surrounding medium .",
    "this allows one to establish the source size as a function of time .    in this paper",
    "we consider the evolution of low - luminosity radio galaxies ( or fr is ) .",
    "we derive the radio power as a function of the source s size , @xmath3 , which can be directly compared with the power - size diagram inferred from observations .",
    "in contrast to friis , there are few discussions on the evolution of the low - luminosity sources , mainly because of the lack of quantitative models that relate the linear sizes to the jet dynamics .",
    "one of the defining features of fr is is that the flare region , the hot - spot equivalent as compared to high - luminosity sources , is located close to the nucleus , which indicates that the jet is decelerated to the subsonic flow regime relatively close by the nucleus . since the jet continues to expand well beyond the flare region ,",
    "forming a diffuse emission region further beyond , the size of a fr i source is not directly related to the location of the flare region and should be determined separately from the expansion of the diffuse region . here",
    "we continue to refer to this diffuse emission region as the lobe as in fr iis despite the significant difference between their morphologies . for low - power jets ,",
    "the physical conditions of the surrounding medium play a critical role in defining the change in the lobe size .",
    "if the medium is warm , the expansion proceeds at near pressure balance against the ambient pressure and the volume increases more slowly with time than the self - similar expansion in the high - luminosity sources . as a result ,",
    "the low - luminosity sources grow in size , by comparison , much more slowly than the high - luminosity sources .    in sec 2",
    ", we discuss a generic model for both high - power and low - power jets . the evolution of the emitting plasma in the lobes is considered in sec 3 , with application to high - power jets in sec 4 .",
    "the evolution of low - luminosity radio sources is discussed in sec 5 .",
    "we consider a generic model of extragalactic radio sources , in which a relativistic jet emanates from the central engine , inflating a large diffuse radio emission region . in the current models of fr iis @xcite , it is generally assumed that particles are accelerated by shocks .",
    "the accelerated particles diffuse through the surrounding region , referred to as the head region where hot spots are located , and are injected into the lobe .",
    "one assumes that these basic ingredients are also true for fr is ( cf .",
    "sec 5 ) except that for low - power jets the shocks occur close to the nucleus and the jets beyond the shocks continue to decelerate .",
    "a schematic diagram for a low - power jet is shown in figure [ fig : frjet ] .",
    "the region where shocks occur is referred to as the flare region . in observations ,",
    "the bright spots in the flare region can be regarded as the hot spot counterparts when compared to high - luminosity sources .",
    "the diffuse emission region , which extends well beyond the shock , is regarded as the lobe in analogy with fr iis .      for radio sources driven by high - powered jets ,",
    "the effect of the pressure of the surrounding medium on the expansion of the lobes is negligible . as a result ,",
    "the jet - driven lobe expands in a self - similar manner .",
    "the distance from the central engine to the shock can be derived using the self - similar expansion argument @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define a working surface at the shock , separating the jet from the lobe .",
    "such hypothesis may appear to be oversimplified , especially for multiple shocks that may occur , but it is useful in formulating a global model that links the various components of the jet - lobe system based energy conservation .",
    "the input power by the jet across the surface is @xmath4 and remains constant over the lifetime , where @xmath4 is the jet power .",
    "the work done by the jet against the ram pressure is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the radial distance to the surface , @xmath7 is the advancing speed of the jet and @xmath8 is the opening angle of the jet . the density profile of the ambient medium , i.e. the halo of its parent galaxy , can be modeled as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the core density and @xmath11 is the core radius , typically about a few kpc @xcite . the profile index @xmath12 is between 1 and 2.5 .",

    ".     much larger than the jet opening angle @xmath26 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the outer boundary of the diffuse emission region that separates it from the external medium , i.e. the galaxy halo or intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "in contrast to high - power jets , no shock develops at the boundary .",
    ", width=302 ]      the self - similar model considered in sec 2.1 may not be applicable for low - power jets .",
    "the pressure in the lobes inflated by the low - power jets can drop rapidly to about the pressure of the external medium . since the density decreases from the core @xmath16 , the pressure of the external medium decreases .",
    "we assume that the pressure in the lobes continues to balance the external pressure that decreases outward .",
    "we refer this scenario to as the pressure - limiting expansion .",
    "the argument for the pressure - limiting expansion can be understood as follows .",
    "assume that the lobe expansion starts with near pressure balance @xmath27 .",
    "if a significant imbalance @xmath28 develops as a result of substantial drop in the external pressure as the lobe expands into the underdense region , the expansion will accelerate and the system will relax to near pressure balance on a time much shorter than the age of the source .",

    "since the emitting particles suffer expansion losses , the luminosity increases gradually untill the synchrotron or ics losses become dominant .",
    "\\2 ) the constant - pressure expansion model ( with @xmath250 ) generally predicts an overabundance of small - size fr i radio sources with a relatively high radio power and at the same time underpredicts the large - size fr i sources .",
    "these features are not consistent with observations ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : pd2 ] ) .",
    "\\3 ) in the pressure - limiting expansion model , the physical conditions of the external medium , e.g. @xmath296 , play an important role in the evolution . by assuming equipartition , one expects to see a direct link between the radio power and the external pressure , i.e. the higher external pressure the higher radio power .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath2 track would also turn over at a much smaller size .",
    "it is interesting to compare the model prediction for low ",
    "luminosity sources with that of high - luminosity sources . for low - power jets ,",
    "the lobes expand slowly in near pressure equilibrium with the external pressure .",
    "thus , fr is evolve much more slowly compared with fr iis .",
    "our model predicts that the radio power of fr is may increase throughout most of their life time .",
    "by contrast , the radio power of fr iis declines in most of their life time ( except for the brief initial rise ) and can be well described by two power - laws .",
    "the initial rise for fr iis is very brief , less than 0.1 myr for the parameters adopted in figure  [ fig : pd1 ] , while for fr is , this can last more than 100 myr .",
    "these differences suggest that these two types of source evolve differently .    in our global model ,",
    "both the details of the particle injection and the effect of spatial diffusion are not treated .",
    "the effect of spatial diffusion can be important in particle transport  this is particularly the case when particle acceleration is confined to a localized site , say the flare region ( ` hot spot ' ) @xcite .",
    "the accelerated particles need to diffuse across the region surrounding the acceleration site . note that this requirement may be relaxed if particles are accelerated by multiple weak shocks distributed over an extended region in the lobe .",
    "particle diffusion should strongly depend on plasma turbulence in the region concerned . to obtain the solution for particle diffusion",
    ", one needs to deal with the full diffusion - loss equation that includes particle diffusion in plasma turbulence @xcite .",
    "one should emphasise that the pressure in the energy equation ( [ eq : el ] ) is the total pressure that may consist of radiating and nonradiating particles as well as magnetic pressure . for convenience ,",
    "we consider only one species of particles ( radiating particles ) .",
    "x - ray observations suggest that in some of the known fr i sources , the equipartition pressure in the lobe is substantially lower than the external pressure @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is that the missing pressure may be provided by nonradiating particles due to entrainment .",
    "although in principle , the case can be treated in a similar way to that presented here for single species of particles by choosing a low @xmath199 and @xmath298 , an extension of this model to including multi - component plasmas in the lobe will be considered in future work .",
    "finally we comment on the equipartition assumption adopted in the calculation of the radio power .",
    "the magnetic fields are assumed to be completely entangled ( i.e. we ignores the effect of the mean field ) .",
    "the equipartition assumption is reasonable as recent _ chandra _ x - ray observations suggest that the magnetic fields in lobes are close to the equipartition field @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the frozen flux argument would suggest that the magnetic energy density in an expanding lobe decreases with time much faster than @xmath299 . to maintain equipartition ,",

    "<S> a model for the evolution of low - luminosity radio galaxies is presented . in the model , </S>",
    "<S> the lobes inflated by low - power jets are assumed to expand in near pressure - balance against the external medium . </S>",
    "<S> both cases of constant external pressure and decreasing external pressure are considered . </S>",
    "<S> evolution of an individual source is described by the power - size track . </S>",
    "<S> the source appears as its lobe is inflated and radio luminosity increases to above the detection level ; the source then moves along the track and eventually disappears as its luminosity drops below the detection limit . </S>",
    "<S> the power - size tracks are calculated including the combined energy losses due to synchrotron radiation , adiabatic expansion , and inverse compton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in general , the constant - pressure model predicts an excess number of luminous , small - size sources while underpredicting large - size sources in the power - size diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted spectra are steep for most sources , which is inconsistent with observations . by comparison </S>",
    "<S> , the pressure - limiting model fits observations better . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> low - luminosity sources undergo substantial expansion losses in the initial phase and as a result , it predicts fewer luminous , small - size sources . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant spectra are flat for most sources except for the oldest ones , which seems consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> the power - size tracks , in contrast to that of high - luminosity radio galaxies , are characterized by a slow increase in luminosity for most of the source s life , followed by a rapid decline when the synchrotron or inverse compton scattering losses set in . </S>"
