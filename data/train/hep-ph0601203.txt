    "the production of charmonium and bottomonium states in high - energy collisions has always been the subject of considerable interest  @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    ", charmonium decays into lepton pairs offer very clean signatures that are used not only for triggering and calibration but also to perform important physics studies .",
    "the decay @xmath2 , for instance , provides an easy handle to qcd studies of @xmath3 production and to the precise determination of some of the ckm parameters , such as @xmath4 .    the importance of quarkonium is widely recognized also by the theoretical community .",
    "charmonium and bottomonium states offer a unique laboratory for testing our understanding of qcd , and in particular of the interplay between the perturbative and non - perturbative regimes , which describe the physics of heavy - quark creation and that of bound state formation , respectively .",
    "the so - called color - singlet model  @xcite has been superseded by a rigorous framework , based on the use of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite , an effective field theory that consistently includes relativistic corrections and provides a solid ground for accurate theoretical analyses .    however , despite the theoretical developments and successes , not all the predictions of the nrqcd factorization approach have been firmly established .",
    "the first example is the universality of the non - pertubative matrix elements , on which the predictive power of this approach relies .",
    "measurements at the tevatron in proton - proton collisions suggest larger values for the color - octet matrix elements than those obtained at hera in electron - proton collisions  @xcite . even more problematic",
    "is the measurement of  polarization at the tevatron .",
    "nrqcd predicts a sizable transverse polarization for s at high-@xmath5 , in contrast with the latest data that now clearly indicate that s are not transversely polarized  @xcite .",
    "while there is no quantitative and accepted explanation for this behaviour , it is generally argued that because the quarkonium mass is still not very large with respect to the qcd scale , in particular for the charmonium system , non - factorizable corrections may not be suppressed enough and/or the expansions in nrqcd may not converge very well .    in the light of the present uncertain status , detailed studies on the range of applicability of the nrqcd approach , above all for charmonium states , are certainly welcome . in this work ,",
    "we perform the nrqcd analysis of charmonium production data as obtained from experiments at fixed - target ( with the exclusion of that induced by pion beams ) and from @xmath0 collisions at low energy .",
    "our purpose is twofold .",
    "first , we present an up - to - date collection of the experimental data on charmonium production in fixed - target experiments .",
    "second , we study whether data are consistent with the nrqcd approach and in particular we extract information on the color - octet contributions , to be compared with that obtained from other experiments .",
    "our analysis represents an improvement with respect to the previous studies presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , both in terms of accuracy of the theoretical predictions and for the more complete and comprehensive treatment of the experimental data .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the framework of the nrqcd approach and state the theoretical results and assumptions that enter into our predictions . in section  [ sec : experiments ] we discuss the experimental data . in section",
    "[ sec : fit ] we describe the fit strategy and present the results .",
    "we draw our conclusions in the last section .",
    "in the nrqcd approach , the cross section for the production of a quarkonium state @xmath6 in a nucleon - nucleon interaction is expressed as a sum of terms , each of which factors into a short - distance coefficient and a long - distance matrix element : @xmath7 + x)\\ , \\langle { \\cal{o}}^{h}\\,[n]\\rangle ,   \\label{eq_fac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indexes @xmath8 run over all the partonic species and @xmath9 denotes the color , spin and angular momentum state of an intermediate @xmath10 pair .",
    "the short - distance cross section @xmath11 can be calculated as a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling @xmath12 .",
    "the nrqcd matrix elements @xmath13 \\rangle$ ] ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for their definition ) are related to the non - perturbative transition probabilities from the @xmath10 state @xmath9 into the quarkonium @xmath6 .",
    "they scale according to a definite power of the intrinsic heavy - quark velocity @xmath14 ( @xmath15 for charmonium and @xmath16 for bottomonium )  @xcite . the general expression ( [ eq_fac ] )",
    "is thus a double expansion in powers of @xmath12 and @xmath14 . while a formal and general proof of eq .",
    "( [ eq_fac ] ) is still lacking , it has been recently shown  @xcite that it holds for high-@xmath5 quarkonium production up to its two - loop description . in this work",
    ", we simply assume that soft effects do not spoil factorization and eq .",
    "( [ eq_fac ] ) holds true also for total cross sections .",

    "our analysis can not be considered as fully at nlo and should be updated once the nlo calculation for the color singlet term will be available . on the other hand ,",
    "this is not an important limitation to our results , as will be made clear in the following .",
    "the non - perturbative matrix elements have to be extracted from the data . for the color - singlet terms",
    "this is straightforward .",
    "it can be easily shown that , up to relativistic corrections of order @xmath22 , they can be related to those appearing in the corresponding decay rates and therefore can be extracted from measurements of decay widths .",
    "on the other hand , color - octet matrix elements can only be extracted from production processes , such as photoproduction or hadroproduction .",
    "the factorization hypothesis implies that the values extracted from different experiments should be universal .",

    "the fact that transverse momentum distributions coming from cp - even states ( @xmath25}$ ] and @xmath26}$ ] ) and the @xmath27}$ ] have different shapes , has been exploited to obtain information on their relative size .",
    "an equally detailed information can not be extracted from fixed - target results , normally limited to the total production rates .",
    "the analysis performed here is based on a code implementing the nlo calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the theoretical inputs",
    ", we make the following choices .",
    "we use @xmath28 with @xmath29 gev as our central value for the renormalization , factorization and nrqcd scales ( all taken equal ) .",
    "we estimate the associated uncertainty by varying the scales between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath32 is tuned to the one used in the pdf sets , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we exploit spin symmetry to reduce the number of independent non - perturbative matrix elements , @xmath33 and consider only leading color octet corrections .",
    "we take the non - perturbative matrix elements collected in tab .  [",
    "tab : vevs ] as our reference values .",
    "color - singlet matrix elements are kept fixed .",
    "for the color - octet matrix elements we adopt the relative normalization as that obtained from tevatron measurements , but for the @xmath18-wave color - octet matrix - element two overall multiplicative numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 are introduced to be fitted with the fixed - target data .",
    "the term @xmath36 is left fixed to its reference value extracted from the tevatron data . with the above assumptions ,",
    "the data are fitted with only two free parameters , the @xmath37 s , which can be interpreted as the fractions of the `` overall tevatron octet contribution '' for @xmath38 and @xmath39 necessary to explain the fixed - target data .",
    "the following theoretical expressions for the cross sections are used : @xmath40 where the superscript d refers to the direct contribution . for the branching ratios we use  @xcite @xmath41",
    "the measurements of  hadroproduction have been performed in a time period spanning about thirty years .",
    "over such a long period , several different experimental techniques have been used and different input information was available at the time of the measurements .",
    "therefore , comparing results of different experiments on an equal footing requires an update of the published numbers on several aspects .",
    "for example , the charmonium branching ratios have changed with time and the treatment of the nuclear effects are not homogeneous . in our compilations , we update all the measurements with the current best knowledge of branching ratios and nuclear effects .",
    "the cross section for  production on a nuclear target of mass number a is parametrized as @xmath42 for this comparison the most precise measurement of @xmath43  @xcite at @xmath44 is used , assuming its independence of the cms - energy .",
    "if an experiment has published cross sections obtained from different targets , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pa ] ) is applied to obtain a combined result .",
    "this is the case for the experiments cern - ps  @xcite ( h , c , w ) , na50  @xcite ( be , al , cu , ag and w ) and  @xcite ( c , ti and w ) . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , we combine the results of na51  @xcite ( h , d targets ) and na38  @xcite ( c , al , cu , w ) .    the results collected in tab .  [ tab : sumexp ] are updated with the latest branching fractions  @xcite ( @xmath45 for  and @xmath46 for ) .",
    "if only the forward cross section (  @xmath47 0 ) is given , we assume a symmetric @xmath48 distribution and multiply the forward cross section by two to obtain the total cross section .",
    "the cross sections of na38 , na50 and na51 are only quoted for a limited phase - space . in order to obtain total cross sections , the extrapolation discussed in the na51 paper",
    "is performed  @xcite .",
    "unless it is clearly stated in the publications , we assume that the quoted uncertainties on branching ratio and atomic mass dependence were taken into account in the systematic uncertainty . therefore we consistently update them in tab .",
    "[ tab : sumexp ] .",
    "the updated results for mid - rapidity and total cross sections are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqsxsect ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" ,",
    "]     the  of the fit is poor for both fits , since , as previously discussed , the measurements of  are not internally compatible .",
    "a reasonable explanation is that in some cases the experimental uncertainty might have been underestimated . with this assumption",
    ", we increased the uncertainties of the fit results by a scaling factor ( @xmath49=2.05 and @xmath49=2.51 respectively ) , obtained following the pdg prescriptions  @xcite .",
    "the ratios of the matrix elements ( , ) provided by the fits differ by about a factor two mainly because of the different scales used .",
    "nevertheless , in both fits the color octet matrix elements are found to be much smaller ( @xmath50 ) than those extracted at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "given that the  pdf shows a worse adaptation to the data , we have decided to choose the  pdf fit as our baseline fit , while the results from the  pdf have been considered in the systematic uncertainties determination .",
    "the fit results as a function of the cms - energy are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : resfit ] for the  pdf . in the top plot",
    "the  cross section is shown . in the bottom - left plot",
    "the  cross section is shown , while the  ratio is displayed in the bottom - right plot .",
    "the open circles in the two bottom plots represent the results calculated from the published papers and not used in the fit ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : sumexp2 ] ) .",
    "the dot - dashed line indicates the nrqcd predictions without any octet contribution in the charmonium production , while the solid line is the result of the fit .",
    "the two dashed lines are obtained by independently varying the scales @xmath51 and @xmath52 between @xmath30 and @xmath53 .",
    "0.2 cm    as one can see the curves obtained from the fit can well reproduce the general trend of the  and  cross sections as a function of the cms - energy . in order to fit the data",
    "the production from singlet states seems to be not sufficient and contributions from octet states must be considered .",
    "however , the fit shows that the amount of octet production is small compared to the results from tevatron data  @xcite and is in agreement the results on charmonium production obtained at hera  @xcite , where the octet contributions were negligible .",
    "the stability of the results with respect to our baseline fit and the systematic uncertainties have been checked with detailed studies , mainly by changing the selection of the measurements to be fitted and the pdf .",
    "first we excluded the experimental results which show a bad partial  ( @xmath54 ) and consequently are not compatible with the nrqcd calculations .",
    "following these prescriptions the four  cross section measurements from the e331  @xcite , e705  @xcite , e595  @xcite and e771  @xcite experiments were left out , obtaining a much improved  ( @xmath55 ) , with only a few percent variation on  and .",
    "similar results have been obtained by excluding the four clearly incompatible measurements of  at 20.6 , 23.8 and 24.3 gev ( e331  @xcite , e444  @xcite , e705  @xcite and ua6  @xcite ) discussed in the previous section .",
    "more fits have been performed by changing the cms - energy range of the measurements and by using different target selections with the  and the  pdf .",
    "again the results showed a very good stability on the cross sections ; the only significant change observed is , as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : fitpdf ] , the dependence of the  and parameters on the actual scales ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and pdf used .",
    "no significant variation of the results is observed when we include in the fit , in addition to  data , only   or only  measurements . in the quoted uncertainties ,",
    "the correlations between different experimental results , due to the dilepton decay branching ratios and to the luminosity and efficiencies determinations for different measures performed by the same experiment , have been found to have a small impact .",
    "once the stability of the fit procedure and its precision have been established , one can obtain predictions for other quantities . as a first application , in fig .",
    "[ fig : resdsdy ] we show the comparison between the differential cross sections @xmath56 at @xmath57=0 , as a function of the cms - energy , and the theoretical predictions at nlo .",
    "the data shown in the plot have not been used in the fit and therefore this result is an important check of the overall consistency of theory and experimental data . as a further application of our analysis , we present the predictions for the  and  cross sections and their ratio at @xmath58 = 41.6 gev , where  @xcite has obtained the most recent result on the  cross section from a minimum bias data sample .",
    "the values obtained from the fit are the following : @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where the quoted errors include the uncertainties due to the fit , to the data selection and to the pdf .",
    "the systematic uncertainties due to the pdf have been obtained following the so called `` les houches accord '' prescriptions as discussed in ref .",
    "in this paper we have collected all available data on  and  production in hadron collisions ( with the exception of data obtained in pion - nucleus collisions ) and updated them in the light of the most precise determinations of nuclear effects .",
    "we have then presented their analysis in the context of nrqcd , using nlo predictions for the short - distance cross sections and fitting the color - octet non - perturbative matrix elements . in order to ease the comparison with the available determinations , we have chosen the values extracted at the tevatron as our reference .",
    "we find sizeable systematic uncertainties associated both to the experimental data , which sometimes are marginally consistent among themselves , and to the fixed - order nature of theoretical predictions .",
    "nevertheless , our results clearly indicate that the amount of color - octet contributions needed to explain fixed - target data is only about 10% of that fitted at the tevatron .",
    "one can certainly argue that part of this discrepancy might be associated to the fact that the tevatron analysis is based on lo calculations only . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference is too large to be resolved by the inclusion of higher - order corrections .",
    "in addition , it is plausible to speculate that once the nlo corrections to the color - singlet production were computed and included in the analysis , there would be very little room left for color - octet contributions to fit the fixed - target experiments , in close analogy to what happens in photoproduction  @xcite and in agreement with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite where a different approach is used .",
