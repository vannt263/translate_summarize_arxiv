    "one of the main topics at the lhc is the production of @xmath0-quarks , both to search for cp violation , looking at @xmath0 decays , and to test qcd , by studying the production mechanism@xcite .",
    "bottom quarks are also a large source of background to several processes of interest , as in various promising channels for higgs detection@xcite .",
    "the production mechanism of heavy quarks in hadronic collisions pose , on the other hand , non trivial problems already at smaller energies , where also the simplest observable quantity , the integrated inclusive cross section , is not reproduced trivially .",
    "the inclusive cross section of @xmath0-quarks production has been evaluated in pqcd at the next to leading order in @xmath1@xcite .",
    "unfortunately comparisons with the recent experimental data of the d0 collaboration@xcite at tevatron have shown that the nlo pqcd calculations underestimate the cross section by a factor @xmath2 , showing that nnlo corrections , whose explicit evaluation is still an open question , give a large contribution to the cross section .",
    "a complementary approach to heavy quarks production , which keeps explicitly into account that transverse momenta and virtualities of the interacting partons become increasingly important in the kinematical regime of @xmath3 , and includes terms at every order in @xmath1 in the calculation of the cross section , is the @xmath4-factorization , where the interaction is factorized into un - integrated structure functions and off shell matrix elements  @xcite@xcite@xcite . from the phenomenological point of view @xmath4-factorization is not inconsistent with hera and tevatron data , allowing one to reproduce both the value of the integrated inclusive cross section and various differential distributions , including the correlation in the azimuthal angle between the produced @xmath0 quarks , where different approaches are less successfully compared with experiment ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , although the value of the integrated inclusive cross section can not be obtained trivially , one may find several cases where the overall effect of higher order corrections amounts to a simple rescaling of the lowest order parton model result .",
    "there are in fact several distributions , derived either using the @xmath4-factorization approach or by working out the cross section at the nlo pqcd , which are rather similar ( apart form the normalization factor ) to those obtained with a simplest lowest order calculation@xcite .",
    "hence , in a few cases , the whole effect of higher order corrections is ( approximately ) reduced to a single numerical value , the so - called @xmath5 factor : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inclusive cross section for @xmath8 production and @xmath9 the result of the lowest order calculation in pqcd .",
    "when looking at extrapolations of the cross section at high energies , one finds that the result is affected by several uncertainties , as the knowledge of the parton structure functions at very small @xmath10 and the values of the heavy quark mass and of the running coupling constant . although the expected inclusive cross section of @xmath0 production is hence still pretty uncertain at lhc energy , all estimates point in the direction of rather large values , as a consequence of the high parton luminosity@xcite .",
    "the fairly large flux of partons make it also plausible to expect a sizable rate of events , where two or more @xmath8 pairs are produced contemporarily by different partonic collisions in a given @xmath11 interaction@xcite .",
    "although at present stage all quantitative predictions for this much more structured interaction process are unavoidably pretty uncertain , the large cross sections foreseen at the lhc is , in our opinion , a strong motivation to make an attempt of giving a few quantitative indications on the production rate of multiple @xmath8 pairs trough multiparton interactions at the lhc , comparing with the rates to be expected by the more conventional single parton scattering mechanism .",
    "since the details of the elementary production of heavy quarks are still a matter of debate , we limit our considerations , for the production of multiple @xmath8 pairs , to the simplest cases , where the whole effect of higher order corrections is taken into account by the overall normalization factor .",
    "given the lack of information on higher order corrections in the @xmath12 processes , we make moreover the assumption that the @xmath5 factors of the @xmath13 and of the @xmath14 processes are equal .",
    "hence we work out the @xmath14 process in the @xmath4-factorization approach , fixing the input parameters by comparing with the tevatron data , and extrapolate the cross section at lhc energies , identifying a few distributions where the effect of higher order corrections reduceds to a simple rescaling of the lowest order result .",
    "the value of the @xmath5-factor derived in this way is then used to renormalize the double @xmath15 and the single @xmath16 parton scattering cross sections , which we evaluate by working out all feynman diagrams at order @xmath17 .",
    "in the @xmath4-factorization approach the @xmath8 production cross section is expressed as@xcite@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unintegrated structure function , representing the probability to find a parton with momentum fraction @xmath10 , transverse momentum @xmath21 at the factorization scale @xmath22 , while @xmath23 is the off - shell partonic cross section of the process @xmath24 .    to work out the inclusive cross section we use two different prescriptions for constructing the @xmath4-distributions from the usual integrated parton densities .",
    "the first prescription is based on the conventional dglap evolutions equations@xcite , with virtual corrections re - summed in the survival probability factor @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "hence the un - integrated structure function for the parton @xmath26 reads @xmath27\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the splitting function , @xmath29 the integrated structure function and @xmath30 a cutoff parameter introduced to give sense to the integral .",
    "although not written explicitly also @xmath31 depends on @xmath30 , in such a way the @xmath32 is a smooth function when @xmath30 becomes small .    as for the second prescription we follow ref.@xcite , where the un - integrated structure functions are obtained from the leading order bfkl equation and",
    "are expressed as the convolution of the usual collinear gluon densities @xmath33 with the universal function @xmath34 @xmath35 the weight factors @xmath36 have a known analytic expression , in double - logarithmic approximation , in terms of bessel functions and depend on the quantity @xmath37 , which in the bfkl formalism is a fixed parameter , related to the pomeron intercept @xmath38 , where @xmath39 in leading log approximation is @xmath40 .",
    "following@xcite we take the value @xmath41 .    to generate the un - integrated structure functions we have used the parton distributions set grv94@xcite with factorization scale @xmath42 . hence in evaluating the cross sections , in the @xmath4-factorization approach , we have set the renormalization scale equal to the gluon virtuality . to obtain the cross section at the lowest order in pqcd we have used the mrs99 parton distributions  @xcite , with factorization and renormalization scale equal to the transverse mass of the @xmath0-quark . comparing the total cross section values in the two approaches ,",
    "we have obtained for the @xmath5-factor the value @xmath43 .    in fig.[tev ] we plot the integrated cross section of @xmath44 production at tevatron(@xmath45tev ) and at lhc(@xmath46tev ) , as a function of the minimum value of the transverse momentum @xmath47 of the @xmath0-quark .",
    "the dotted curves represent the cross section derived using the unintegrated gluon structure function , according with the bfkl prescription of eq(4 ) , whereas the dashed lines have been obtained by using the prescription in eq(3 ) .",
    "the continuous lines represent the result of the lowest order calculation multiplied by the @xmath5 factor . at tevatron energy",
    "the @xmath0-quark distributions are within the rapidity interval @xmath48 and are compared with the d0 experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the same distributions , extrapolated at lhc energy , are then plotted as a function of @xmath47 within the pseudorapidity interval @xmath49 , corresponding to the acceptance of the alice detector .    in fig.[etapm ]",
    "we show the rapidity@xmath50 and pseudorapidity@xmath51 distributions normalized to one and within @xmath49 . here",
    "the continuous histograms refer to the result of the lowest order calculation , rescaled by the @xmath5 factor , whereas the dashed histograms represent the distributions evaluated with the @xmath4-factorization approach .",
    "as one may see also in this case the whole effect of higher orders reduces to a simple rescaling .",
    "the leading order qcd process to produce two pairs of heavy quarks is given by the single parton scattering term at the fourth order in the coupling constant@xcite .",
    "a competing mechanism at the lhc energy is the double parton scattering@xcite .",
    "we compare the two mechanisms in proton - proton collisions in the kinematical range of the alice and of the lhcb detectors , namely at center - of - mass energies of @xmath53 and @xmath54 tev , within the pseudorapidity regions @xmath49 and @xmath55 , down to very low transverse momenta .",
    "the single scattering pqcd sub - processes at the lowest order in @xmath56 , in @xmath57 , are the quarks initiated process , @xmath58 , whose amplitude is given by the sum of @xmath54 feynman diagrams for each flavor in the initial state , and gluon fusion , @xmath59 , represented by @xmath60 diagrams altogether , the latter amplitude giving the dominant contribution to the cross section at small @xmath10 .",
    "to evaluate the cross section we have generated the matrix elements of the partonic amplitudes with madgraph  @xcite and helas  @xcite and we have used the mrs99 parton distributions  @xcite , with the factorization scale equal to the renormalization scale @xmath61 , which we have kept fixed at the value of the transverse mass of the produced @xmath0 quark . for the mass of the bottom quark we have used the value @xmath62 gev .",
    "the multi - dimensional integrations have been performed by vegas  @xcite and the resulting cross section has been finally multiplied by the @xmath5 factor obtained as described in the previous section .",
    "the evaluation of the double parton scattering contribution to the cross section is considerably more uncertain because of the unknown non perturbative input to the process , given by the two - body parton distribution functions @xmath63@xcite , where @xmath64 are the fractional momenta of the two partons belonging to the same hadron and @xmath65 their distance in transverse space .",
    "although not explicitly written , the distributions depend also on the scale factors characterizing each elementary interaction and on the different kinds of partons involved . given the large parton population at low @xmath10 , to proceed",
    "further we make the usual simplifying assumption of neglecting correlations in fractional momenta and we factorize the two - body parton distribution as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 are the usual one - body parton distributions and @xmath68 is a function normalized to 1 and representing the parton pair density in transverse space . with these assumptions the cross section acquires the simplified form@xcite @xmath69 where the indices @xmath70 label the different cases where each @xmath8 pair is originated either by a @xmath71 annihilation , discriminating the cases of sea and valence , or by two gluons and @xmath72 represents the inclusive cross sections for @xmath8 production in a hadronic collision , with the index @xmath73 labelling a definite parton process .",
    "the weight factors @xmath74 have dimension an inverse cross section and result from integrating the product of the two - body parton distributions in transverse space , while the factor @xmath75 is a consequence of the symmetry of the expression for exchanging @xmath73 and @xmath76 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath74 on the indices @xmath70 accounts for the possibility , for different pairs of partons in the hadron structure , to be characterized by different values of their relative average transverse distance  @xcite @xcite .",
    "notice that by measuring the double parton collisions one has access to a new information on the hadron structure , summarized in these weight factors , which can not be obtained in hard processes with a single parton interaction only .",
    "the experimental information on the double parton scatterings is due to the four - jet production measurement in @xmath11 collisions at @xmath77 gev , performed by the afs collaboration@xcite , and to the study of final states with three minijets and one photon in @xmath78 collisions at @xmath79 gev , due to cdf @xcite@xcite . in both cases",
    "the cross section was expressed as @xmath80 where @xmath81 if the two parton processes @xmath82 and @xmath83 are identical , while @xmath84 if they are different and @xmath85 is the single scattering inclusive cross section .",
    "the overall output of the experiment hence reduces to the value of a single parameter , the scale factor @xmath86 , whose value is @xmath87 mb for afs , while @xmath88 mb for cdf .",
    "the two experimental results are not inconsistent , given the different content of partons in the two cases , mainly valence quarks in the former case and mostly gluons and sea quarks in the latter ; the experimental indication hence pointing in the direction of a sizable dependence of the factors @xmath74 in ( [ sdouble ] ) on the different elementary processes .",
    "interestingly , the measurement of @xmath86 for different final states , as a function of the c.m . energy and cuts applied , allows one obtaining the values of the scale factors @xmath74 , letting in this way access to the three dimensional structure of the proton@xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath89 production at the lhc is gluon fusion , so , for the present purposes , the sum in ( [ sdouble ] ) may be approximated well by a single term , where the scale factor could not be strongly different with respect to the case of the cdf experiment .",
    "hence , to evaluate the double scattering cross section , we have used the simplest expression    @xmath90    where for @xmath86 we have taken the value reported by cdf . notice that since @xmath91 is proportional to @xmath92 , the effect of higher order corrections is enhanced on @xmath91 : + @xmath93 where @xmath94 refers to the lowest order expressions of the cross section .",
    "in fig.[4becm ] we plot the expected rise of the total @xmath95 production cross section as a function of the c.m .",
    "the continuous curves refer to the double parton scattering contribution , while the dotted curves to single scattering . in each case",
    "the lower curve refers to the value @xmath96 , while the higher curve to @xmath97 , which are the typical estimate of the nlo - qcd and the result of our calculation within the @xmath4-factorization approach .",
    "notice that at the lhc the double parton scattering gives a contribution to the integrated cross section about ten times larger than the single scattering .    to see how the cross section depends on the transverse momenta",
    "we have plotted in fig.[4bpt14 ] the two contributions to the integrated cross section , as a function of @xmath47 , the minimum value of the transverse momenta of the @xmath0 quarks ( which we require to be all inside the pseudorapidity interval @xmath49 ) , for the center - of - mass energy values of 14 and 5.5 tev .",
    "the continuous histograms refer to the double parton scattering contribution , while the dotted histograms to single scattering .",
    "the double parton cross section decreases faster with @xmath47 than the single parton cross section , the two contributions being of the same order at @xmath98 gev .",
    "pseudorapidity , and rapidity distributions at 14 and 5.5 tev are plotted in fig.[4beta14 ] ( always requiring for the two @xmath0-quarks @xmath49 ) , where continuous and dashed histograms have the same meaning as in the previous cases .    to see how the results depend on rapidity ,",
    "we have plotted in fig[4blhcb ] the same rapidity ( @xmath99 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath100 ) distributions at @xmath101 tev , requiring both @xmath0-quarks to be in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath55 , which corresponds to the acceptance of the lhcb experiment . in the same figure",
    "we also compare the two contributions of single and double parton scattering , integrated within the rapidity acceptance of the lhcb , as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the overall indication which one obtains from the present study is that double parton scatterings dominate the @xmath89 integrated cross section by a large factor , both in the central rapidity region and at the larger rapidity values of the lhcb experiment . in both cases",
    "the contribution of the single parton scattering term becomes important only after applying cuts to the transverse momenta of the order of 8 - 10 gev .",
    "the large values expected for the @xmath89 cross section , which at @xmath54 tev are of the order of one @xmath22b , inside the alice and the lhcb detectors , and the localization of the double scattering contribution at relatively low @xmath102 values , suggest that heavy quark pairs production at the lhc might represent an efficient tool for studying the gluon initiated double parton scattering process .",
