    "early - type galaxies obey a tight linear relation in 3-d log - space , the fundamental plane ( fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",

    "are possible .    over the past twenty years",
    "a significant effort has been devoted to understand the physical processes involved in this empiric relationship in the nearby universe .",
    "previous works of field early - type galaxies at higher redshift up to @xmath5 found evidence for a mass dependent evolution ( e.g. , treu et al . 2005 ; di serego alighieri et al .",
    "recently , fritz et al . ( 2009a ) detected recent star formation in less - massive field early - type galaxies up to @xmath6 .",
    "this rejuvenation accounts for 5 - 10% in the total stellar mass budget of these galaxies , possible triggered through agn feedback .",
    "target galaxies were selected from the gemini / hst galaxy cluster project . this project is an extensive observational campaign to investigate the formation and evolution of distant galaxies in rich galaxy clusters from @xmath7 to the present - day ( jrgensen et al .",
    "2005 ) . for 15 massive , @xmath8-ray luminous galaxy clusters ( @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 ) from @xmath11",
    "to 1 , intermediate - resolution gemini / gmos spectroscopy and hst / acs or wfpc2 imaging were obtained .",
    "the mos masks included primarily expected cluster members , while vacant space was filled with slits for objects that have similar brightnesses but slightly bluer or redder colours than expected for early - type cluster members .",
    "out of three cluster fields , rxj0152.7 - 1357 , rxj1226.9 + 3332 and rxj1415.1 + 3612 , we have extracted 20 galaxies with early - type morphology and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) which are used in the following .",
    "the high @xmath14 and intermediate resolution galaxy spectra ( @xmath15 ) allows us to study in detail the internal kinematics and stellar populations of the galaxies .",
    "using deep hst / acs imaging , we fit model profiles to the galaxies to derive the effective parameters ( chiboucas et al .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the fp for field early - type galaxies ( squares ) in rest - frame johnson @xmath16-band , compared to 116 early - type galaxies in the coma cluster ( triangles ) .",
    "the slope of the fp for field galaxies at high redshift is steeper than that for their local counterparts .",
    "we interpret the slope difference between the distant and local relation as a mass - dependent evolution .",
    "less - massive field galaxies ( @xmath17 ) evolve faster than their more massive counterparts .",
    "the @xmath18 evolution with @xmath19 is under investigation .",
    "similar results have been found for galaxy clusters at @xmath20 ( jrgensen et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; fritz et al .",
    "this suggest that environmental effects play only a minor role on the evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "a combined analysis of the fp and absorption line strengths for the field galaxies will be presented in fritz et al .",
