    "introducing the notion of non - commutative space in string theories have made fruitful and remarkable results in these years . among them , solitons in various non - commutative theories have played a central role in understanding the physics of non - commutative theories and certain situations of string theories .",
    "one of the applications is the string field theories in which introducing the non - commutativity makes it possible to construct d - branes as solitons @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - commutative field theories are interesting subjects by themselves , especially when they are realized as the low energy description of d - branes in string theories .",
    "solitons in these theories have interpretation of the brane configurations , and using the brane configuration techniques new phenomena such as the non - locality of the non - commutative monopoles @xcite and the resolution of the small instanton singularity in the moduli space of the non - commutative instantons @xcite have been investigated .    in the sequence of the above study",
    ", some exact solutions for finite non - commutativity parameters have been constructed . among them",
    ", the transformation proposed recently by harvey , kraus and larsen ( hkl ) @xcite is particularly interesting , because it transforms a trivial solution ( such as a vacuum solution ) into a non - trivial classical solution of equations of motion .",
    "we summarize their method briefly here .",
    "let us consider a general action written in terms of various fields @xmath0 which are represented by operators on the the non - commutative space .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath1 the hkl transformation is defined using the `` almost '' unitary operator u as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , however @xmath4 . under this transformation ,",
    "the equations of motion remain intact : @xmath5 since to show the invariance of the equations of motion one uses only @xmath3 , the opposite combination @xmath6 is not necessarily a unity . because @xmath7 , the combination @xmath6 must be a projection operator . therefore ,",
    "if we adopt some non - trivial projector @xmath6 , the transformation ( [ eq : tra ] ) generates new solitons of equations of motion . note that we have assumed that there is no source term for the field @xmath0 in the action .",
    "if the source term is present , then a part of the equations of motion coming from the source term is not invariant under the hkl transformation .    in general",
    ", the hkl transformation generates non - bps solutions .",
    "this is because the bps equations in non - commutative gauge theories generally contain a constant term which becomes a source term in the bps equations mentioned above .",
    "however , in this paper , using a simple trick , we show that the bps fluxon solution @xcite which represents a d - string piercing a d3-brane can be reconstructed by the hkl method .",
    "a virtue of this reconstruction is that we can find variations of the fluxon solutions .",
    "these solutions have interesting brane interpretation . using the seiberg - witten map @xcite which relates the non - commutative description to the ordinary description , we study the width of the fluxon and clarify the reason why there is no corresponding solution in the ordinary description .",
    "let us consider the 1 + 3 dimensional non - commutative gauge theory with a scalar field @xmath8 .",
    "we introduce non - commutativity only in the @xmath9-@xmath10 plane : @xmath11=i\\theta$ ] .",
    "the equations of motion in the operator representation are written as @xmath12+[\\phi,[\\phi , d_\\mu ] ] = 0,\\\\ { } [ d_\\mu,[d_{\\mu } , \\phi ] { } ] = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have defined covariant derivatives @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) where the gauge field @xmath15 is anti - hermitian .",
    "one recognizes that this equations of motion are that of ikkt iib matrix model @xcite . when written in terms of operator language ,",
    "the equations of motion can be expressed always in the form of matrix models .",
    "this indicates a close relation between non - commutative gauge theories and matrix models .",
    "assuming static configurations @xmath16 and no electric field excitation @xmath17 , the above equations of motion are consistent with the following first order bps equation @xmath18 = 0 , \\label{eq : bps0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the magnetic field and @xmath20 . taking the gauge @xmath21 , the bps equations become @xmath22 + \\frac{1}{\\theta } , \\quad { \\partial}_3 d_1 = -i [ d_2 , \\phi ] , \\quad { \\partial}_3 d_2 = -i [ \\phi , d_1 ] .",
    "\\label{eq : bps1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defining @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we write these equations in a simple form for the latter convenience as @xmath25 + \\frac{1}{\\theta } , \\quad { \\partial}_3 d = [ d , \\phi ] .",
    "\\label{eq : bps2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hkl transformation applied to this theory is @xmath26 so as to keep the @xmath21 gauge , the transformation operator @xmath27 has to be independent of @xmath28 .",
    "one notices immediately that , though this transformation keeps the equations of motion ( [ eq : eom ] ) invariant , it changes the bps equations ( [ eq : bps2 ] ) .",
    "this is simply because the constant term @xmath29 exists in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bps2 ] ) .",
    "this constant term behaves as if it is a source term in the equation . generally , bps equations are the first order equations and contain field strengths which are not in commutators .",
    "so the bps equations in the non - commutative space have the constant term which is not invariant under the hkl transformation .",
    "this shows that the hkl transformation generates non - bps solutions of equations of motion in general .",
    "however , in our case , there is a certain method to obtain bps solutions using the hkl transformation .",
    "note that above bps equations ( [ eq : bps1 ] ) are precisely the nahm s equations for the non - commutative monopoles @xcite .",
    "the trick used in the papers was to redefine one of the ingredients as @xmath30 in terms of this @xmath31 , the bps equations ( [ eq : bps2 ] ) do not include the constant term @xmath29 and they look as if they are in the commutative space .",
    "@xmath32 , \\quad { \\partial}_3 d = [ d , \\phi ] .",
    "\\label{eq : posbps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence we can apply the hkl transformation on these equations without the constant term .    before applying the transformation ,",
    "let us see simple solutions to be transformed .",
    "one of them is @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are real constant parameters and @xmath36 is a creation operator : @xmath37 .",
    "some particular choices of these parameters exhibit interesting solutions .",
    "first , the choice ( i ) @xmath38 provides us with a trivial vacuum solution with @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the second choice ( ii ) @xmath41 , @xmath42 is interesting . in this case",
    "@xmath43 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sol1]-(ii ) ) and we have a constant field strength @xmath44+\\frac{1}{\\theta})=-1/\\theta$ ] .",
    "note that the surface expressed by the scalar @xmath8 has the constant slope which is exactly the same slope as the one that a fluxon solution @xcite has .",
    "the fluxon solution represents a d - string piercing the d3-brane , therefore our solution ( ii ) represents a brane configuration that all the world volume is filled with many parallel piercing d - strings .",
    "we can not see the d3-brane ! how this situation is possible in the non - commutative theory and impossible in the equivalent ordinary theory will be addressed later .",
    "( -96,90)@xmath34 ( -96,140)@xmath8 ( -270,140)@xmath8 ( 0,45)@xmath28 ( -190,45)@xmath28 ( -60,0)@xmath9 , @xmath10 ( -234,0)@xmath9 , @xmath10 ( -300,0)(i ) ( -130,0)(ii )    then let us perform the hkl transformation on this solution ( [ eq : solution ] ) . taking the simplest nontrivial transformation @xmath45 , the result for the choice ( i ) is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the projection operator onto the state @xmath48 .",
    "this is precisely the bps fluxon @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sol2]-(i ) ) .",
    "thus we have reproduced the bps fluxon solution using the hkl transformation . for the choice ( ii )",
    ", the result is @xmath49 note that the magnetic field is not changed from the one before the hkl transformation . from the configuration of @xmath8 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sol2]-(ii ) , we interpret this solution as the smeared many parallel d - strings with a single d - string protruded out of them in parallel .",
    "this solution is similar to the non - bps solutions found in ref.@xcite : a certain moduli of the solution is corresponding to the transverse separation of the object from the main brane . in our case ,",
    "the parameter @xmath34 measures the separation of a single d - string from the other smeared surface of the d - strings .",
    "again , we can not see the d3-brane surface . to our best knowledge",
    ", no similar solution has been found in the ordinary theories .",
    "( -96,90)@xmath34 ( -96,140)@xmath8 ( -270,140)@xmath8 ( 0,45)@xmath28 ( -190,45)@xmath28 ( -60,0)@xmath9 , @xmath10 ( -234,0)@xmath9 , @xmath10 ( -300,0)(i ) ( -130,0)(ii )    we can generalize the above construction easily to the non - abelian case . adopting a simple solution ( we are working in @xmath50 gauge group for simplicity ) @xmath51 after the hkl transformation we obtain a generalized fluxon which represents a d - string piercing two parallel d3-branes .",
    "the fluxon solution was originally constructed by observing an asymptotic behavior of the non - commutative @xmath52 monopole solution in ref .",
    "@xcite . at @xmath53 ,",
    "the non - commutative monopole solution becomes extremely simple and have the form of eq.([eq : fluxon ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath8 is given by the projection operator @xmath47 which is a gaussian of the width @xmath54 whose center is located at the origin of the non - commutative plane ( @xmath9-@xmath10 plane ) . therefore the fluxon has the width of @xmath54 .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this non - commutative theory has an equivalent ordinary description with the ns - ns 2-form @xmath55-field , not with the non - commutativity .",
    "this is the ordinary dirac - born - infeld theory with the @xmath55-field , and in this theory a solution corresponding to the non - commutative monopole through the seiberg - witten map was constructed @xcite .",
    "the construction of this solution is due to the performance of the rotation in the target space .",
    "in fact , the solution satisfies a non - linear bps equation , and this rotation in the target space relates the non - linear bps equation to the linear one , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath55-field .",
    "the solution of this linear equation is @xmath58 the first term ( `` spike '' of the bion ) shows the d - string ending on the d3-brane @xcite .",
    "the second term represents a slope of the d3-brane surface . performing on the above linear solution ( [ eq : solor ] ) the rotation in the target space so that the d3-brane surface become horizontal , one obtains the solution of the non - linear bps equations @xcite .",
    "this configuration with the horizontal d3-brane corresponds to the non - commutative monopole of ref .",
    "@xcite through the seiberg - witten map .",
    "as is seen in the following , in the ordinary description , we can not obtain a solution representing a d - string piercing the d3-brane .",
    "if one wants to pierce the d3-brane , one has to add @xmath59 to the above solution ( [ eq : solor ] ) .",
    "this @xmath59 term represents the d - string elongating in the @xmath60 direction .",
    "however , this term cancels the first term in ( [ eq : solor ] ) and the whole spike vanishes .",
    "another argument is as follows : the fluxon solution is obtained by seeing the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath61 ) of the non - commutative monopole .",
    "if one see the corresponding asymptotic behavior of the solution of the ordinary side in refs.@xcite , it is easy to find that at the positive infinity of @xmath28 the solution becomes singular .",
    "the width of the bion is getting thinner and thinner in this asymptotic region .",
    "these arguments show that the fluxon solution in the ordinary description does not exist .",
    "however , if one believes the validity of the seiberg - witten map , the fluxon can be mapped to some configuration in the ordinary description .",
    "then what happens to the seiberg - witten map ?",
    "the hint for answering this question is in the solution of the choice ( ii ) above ( fig .",
    "1-(ii ) ) .",
    "that solution consists simply of many parallel d - strings , no d3-brane .",
    "let us pay attention to the field strength of that solution .",
    "as in ref.@xcite , the seiberg - witten map can be exactly solved for constant field strength .",
    "particularly , when @xmath62 , it was shown that there is no corresponding ordinary description : @xmath63 .",
    "this is the case for the choice ( ii ) .",
    "thus there is no solution like this ( ii ) in the ordinary description . in this sense , this solution ( ii ) is proper to the non - commutative gauge theory .",
    "now , let us see the seiberg - witten map of the monopole solution ( [ eq : solor ] ) .",
    "as in the same manner , when @xmath64 in the ordinary description , the seiberg - witten map becomes singular and the non - commutative field strength diverges @xcite . at the infinity @xmath65 the solution ( [ eq : solor ] ) satisfies @xmath66 ( we have assumed @xmath67 for simplicity ) .",
    "so we can not reach the region @xmath68 in the non - commutative description",
    "because at the point @xmath64 the seiberg - witten map becomes singular .",
    "the region @xmath69 is almost a ball with a radius @xmath70 in the world volume . at the surface of this ball",
    "the non - commutative field strength is diverging .",
    "so this radius corresponds to the size of the flux tube in the non - commutative description . using the essential relation @xmath71 @xcite in the seiberg - witten map",
    ", we expect that the width of the fluxon is @xmath54 .",
    "this is in agreement with the explicit solution of the fluxon ( [ eq : fluxon ] ) .",
    "this argument shows also that the non - commutative monopole solution of ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to only a part of the d3-brane surface of the solution in the ordinary description : in the region @xmath69 of the solution ( [ eq : solor ] ) there is no non - commutative counterpart which is properly defined also at @xmath65 .",
    "in sec .  2 , we have applied the hkl transformation to the bps equations of the non - commutative monopoles .",
    "it needs the trick of redefinition of the scalar field to apply the transformation .",
    "usually bps equations are the first order equations , and therefore contain terms consisting merely of field strengths @xmath72 . on non - commutative space the field strength is defined using the commutator of the derivatives which now gives a constant term . due to this constant term in the field strength",
    ", the bps equations are not left intact under the hkl transformation , though the equations of motion are invariant on the contrary because they are usually the second order equations . taking a commutation of @xmath72 , then the troublesome constant terms is always dropped .",
    "hence , usually the hkl transformation does not generate solutions satisfying bps equations .",
    "a natural question is the following : when can we apply the hkl transformation to bps equations ? in sec .  2 , we have used the trick to absorb the constant term by noting that the nahm s equation is in the same form as the bps equations of the non - commutative monopoles ( [ eq : bps1 ] ) .",
    "this coincidence is because these two are related with each other by a non - commutative analogue of the nahm s transform @xcite .",
    "( the nahm s equation can be understood as a bps equation on d - string worldsheet gauge theory @xcite . to deal with the non - commutative monopoles in string theory , one needs to put d - strings ending on parallel d3-branes , in the @xmath55-field @xcite .",
    "the above nahm s transform is possibly understood as t - dualities with the @xmath55-field in terms of string theory ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which exchange the roles of d - strings and d3-branes . )",
    "the nahm s equation parameterize the moduli space of monopoles .",
    "the trick in sec .",
    "2 was used to show that the non - commutativity does not affect the moduli space @xcite .",
    "hence , this suggests that if the non - commutativity does not change the moduli space then we can use the hkl transformation to obtain bps solutions .",
    "this argument is consistent with the self - dual instanton solution @xcite which is bps but can be obtained by the hkl transformation .",
    "note that in this case the non - commutativity @xmath73 is also self - dual , thus the self - dual equation describing this non - commutative instanton is not modified . consistently with the nahm s transform ,",
    "the adhm equation is not modified by the self - dual non - commutativity parameter @xcite , thus the moduli space of this instanton is not changed and includes a small instanton singularity @xcite .",
    "the above argument is applied only for the bps equations which can be obtained by the dimensional reduction of the self - dual instanton equation in 4-dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "one of the other examples of such theories is the bps non - abelian vortex described by the hitchin equation .",
    "the non - commutative version of this bps equation contains a constant term explicitly which can not be removed by any field redefinition .",
    "so this bps vortex can not be treated by the hkl transformation .",
    "one of the other types of the bps equations is on the vortex of the 1 + 2-dimensional non - commutative abelian - higgs model @xcite : @xmath74=[\\bar{d},\\phi]=0,\\quad b=\\phi\\bar{\\phi}-\\phi_0 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{eq : vortex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath75 is the bottom of the potential for the complex scalar field @xmath76 , and only for the special choice of the coefficient of this potential we can achieve the saturation of the bps bound with the above equations @xcite . since the definition of the magnetic field in the non - commutative space is @xmath77 - 1/\\theta$ ] , we observe that if and only if @xmath78 , the constant term in eq .  ( [ eq : vortex ] ) vanishes and we can apply the hkl transformation to obtain bps solutions .",
    "we shall not write the explicit solutions here because a similar solution has already been obtained in ref.@xcite .    not only the fluxons , but also the bps non - commutative monopole solution itself @xcite is possibly generated by the hkl transformation using the trick of sec .  2 .",
    "the non - commutative monopole solution depends on @xmath28 , thus accordingly the soliton - generating operator @xmath27 should be @xmath28-dependent . in sec .  2 we have chosen a @xmath28-independent @xmath27 so as to keep the @xmath21 gauge .",
    "however , we can choose another prescription of the application of the hkl transformation : assume that @xmath79 is not transformed by any @xmath27 . then the remaining equations ( [ eq : posbps ] ) is invariant under the hkl transformation if @xmath80 =    [ d , u^\\dagger{\\partial}_3 u ] = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : x3dep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way one can generate @xmath28-dependent bps solutions .",
    "however , the above constraint ( [ eq : x3dep ] ) on @xmath81 is turned out to be difficult to be solved even for a specific choice of @xmath8 and @xmath82 ( such as the vacuum solution ) .",
    "we leave this issue for the future study .",
    "we would like to thank d.  j.  gross and p.  kraus for useful comments .",
