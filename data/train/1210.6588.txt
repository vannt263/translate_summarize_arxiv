    "bondi - hoyle accretion is the evolution of a homogeneously distributed gas moving uniformly toward a central compact object @xcite .",
    "depending of the relation existing between the velocity of the gas and the sound speed a shock cone can be formed .",
    "specifically , when the fluid is supersonic , a shock cone appears , otherwise it does not .",
    "when the compact object is rotating , an interesting phenomenon , called flip - flop instability can appear @xcite .",
    "this effect consists in the oscillation of the shock cone orientation .",
    "various studies of this effect have been carried out under different conditions and for different purposes .",
    "for example , in newtonian gravity , considering the density and velocity field to be non - uniform , they found that the shock cone might achieve a disk - like topology @xcite ; also the dependence of the appearance of the flip - flop behaviour in terms of the size of the object has been studied @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical relevance of the flip - flop of the shock cone is associated for example with the fluctuations observed in the x - ray emission of pulsing systems such as vela - x1 and exo 2030 + 375 , that are not associated to the orbital period of the binary system @xcite .",
    "the flip - flop effect can also happen within a relativistic scenario .",
    "particularly interesting is the case when the compact object is a black hole .",
    "this case was first reported in @xcite and we consider this is a very important subject to be studied in detail , because the oscillations ( of different nature ) of a gas around a black hole may potentially explain the oscillatory behaviour of high energy sources , like quasi periodical oscillating sources ( qpos ) or bursts when the shock cone is unstable .",
    "moreover , we consider the treatment involving the curved background space - time to be a very important step , which uses a truly black hole space - time background instead of the commonly used pseudo - newtonian paczyski - wiita type potentials .",
    "we are in the position of analyzing the case where the gas is truly allowed to enter the black hole s event horizon , this is what we do in this paper . in the relativistic bondi - hoyle accretion ,",
    "the flip - flop instability in the equatorial plane was briefly reported by @xcite .",
    "however , the coordinates used to describe the rotating kerr black hole are not appropriate , because the boyer - lindquist coordinates are singular at the event horizon , and as a consequence it is necessary -as in the newtonian cases- to apply boundary conditions at an inner time - like artificial boundary outside and near the horizon .    in this work",
    "we study the bondi - hoyle accretion process using the kerr - schild penetrating coordinates in the equatorial plane , in these coordinates the fluid naturally falls into the black hole .",
    "we also study the case of using the singular boyer - lindquist coordinates in order to reproduce the flip - flop effect and measure its amplitude and phase .",
    "we reproduce the morphological behaviour in @xcite , and measure the amplitude of the flip - flop oscillations using boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "however , when using ks coordinates , there are some oscillations with a frequency that is not comparable to that observed when using bl coordinates associated to the flip - flop effect ; we observe that these oscillations are due to numerical artifacts because their amplitude converges to zero when resolution is increased .",
    "in fact , there is a precedent within the newtonian regime where it has been found that shock cone instabilities can be associated with the implementation of boundary conditions at the surface of the accretor , and may also influence the attached or detached nature of the shock to the compact object or numerical parameters in the calculations @xcite .",

    "the election of both the interior boundary at @xmath61 and the exterior one at @xmath62 deserves a careful analysis .",
    "first of all , the interior boundary may be space - like or time - like , depending on whether it lies inside the black hole event horizon or outside respectively . in most of previous analyses",
    "such boundary is time - like because the coordinates used are boyer - lindquist , which are singular at the event horizon , and as a way to avoid dealing with the coordinate singularity there , @xmath55 is chosen simply to be outside the event horizon ; the price to pay with such an election is that this internal boundary requires the implementation of boundary conditions for the fluid variables in a region where the gravitational field is strong and the gradients of the variables involved are big , which eventually implies the propagation of numerical errors .",
    "our approach involves the use of ks horizon penetrating coordinates for a rotating black hole .",
    "what can be done is to define @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the radius of the event horizon at the equatorial plane , and defines a sphere where the light cones point toward the singularity of the black hole , which automatically implies that material particles approaching such boundary have no other fate than moving also toward the singularity and there is no need to impose a boundary condition there ; this is a well known numerical technique used in numerical relativity called black hole excision @xcite .",
    "it is clear that even though the spatial slices penetrate the horizon we can not include the singularity as a part of the numerical domain , and we choose @xmath65 .",
    "this implies indirectly that the election of @xmath55 will depend on the rotation parameter of the black hole @xmath51 that defines the event horizon radius @xmath64 .",
    "the possibility to choose @xmath55 inside the event horizon is the core of this paper , because we want to investigate whether or not the flip - flop instability of the shock cone in the relativistic bondi - hoyle accretion is due to the use of inappropriate coordinates .    with respect to the external boundary",
    ", the election of @xmath56 is also restricted .",
    "the formation of a shock cone strongly depends on the condition that on the one hand the gas has to move at supersonic speed and on the other , not all the material has to be accreted by the black hole , which can happen by simply considering @xmath66 , where @xmath54 is the radius of accretion within which all the material is captured by the black hole and is defined in relativity by @xcite    @xmath67    the boundary conditions used at this boundary are outflow in the downstream region and we inject gas with the initial density and velocity in the upstream region @xcite .    the numerical grid is uniformly spaced in the @xmath53 and @xmath68 directions .",
    "in particular we use the base resolution of @xmath69 in @xmath53 direction and @xmath70 in the @xmath68 direction for the evolution of all the models .",
    "we use a constant time step given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a fixed and constant courant factor estimated empirically @xmath73 .",
    "finally , in order to avoid the divergences in our variables along the evolution , due to the definition of the specific enthalpy , we introduce an artificial atmosphere , that is , we impose the rest mass density to be no smaller that the minimum value @xmath74 .",
    "we have found similar results as done in the past , particularly , in the supersonic case , a shock cone characterized by a zone of high density shows up at the rare part of the black hole .",
    "this behaviour appears to be a sort of late - time attractor behavior . in order to compare with previous research",
    "we show various examples . as illustrative cases we show in figure [ fig : contour ] two examples of the shock cone morphology using ks coordinates , for two different values of the adiabatic index @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "several other cases were studied by changing the velocity of the wind and the rotation parameter of the black hole , see table 1 .",
    "the morphology of the rest mass density is consistent with previous analyses @xcite .    .",
    "the radial coordinate in units of the accretion radius @xmath54.,width=321 ]    another important check is the measure of the mass accretion rate across a circle in the equatorial plane @xmath21 , @xmath77 , as an indicator of the accretion process during the evolution .",
    "we measure the mass accretion rate in terms of the proper time @xmath78 at a given detector . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdotb ] we show the accretion rate for three different values of the initial velocity of the gas in order to illustrate the dependence of the accretion rate on the velocity of the wind .",
    "our measurements are performed at a detector located at @xmath79 for three different models .",
    "the figure shows that the higher the velocity of the wind the smaller the accretion rate .",
    "again these results are consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the flip - flop motion of the shock cone consists in the oscillation of the cone itself along the angular direction .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : bl ] snapshots of the shock cone morphology at various times for the model bl2 .",
    "it can be clearly observed that the shock cone oscillates considerably in the angular direction .",
    "similar results in the relativistic regime were reported recently for the first time in @xcite .",
    "something that called our attention is the possibility that the flip - flop behaviour might be due to the numerical implementation of boundary conditions near the event horizon , because both in @xcite and in fig .",
    "[ fig : bl ] , bl singular coordinates at the event horizon are being used .",
    "particularly important is that in order to simulate accretion processes it is necessary to use a radial domain such that @xmath80 $ ] with @xmath81 , which implies that the inner boundary is time - like ; moreover , if one wants to track the evolution of the gas up to regions near the black hole , the metric functions in non - penetrating coordinates tend to diverge and the gradients of the hydrodynamical variables are high .",
    "then errors coming due to the implementation of a time - like artificial boundary near the event horizon are expected to contaminate the simulations in the numerical domain .    , top - right panel @xmath82 , bottom - left panel @xmath83 and bottom - right panel @xmath84 ) are shown .",
    "the motion of the shock cone along the angular coordinate is called the flip - flop behavior .",
    "we claim in this paper that the amplitude of such oscillations are highly dependent on the coordinates used to describe the black hole space - time , because they are singular at the event horizon .",
    "the units of the spatial coordinates are rescaled with @xmath54.,width=321 ]    in order to investigate this , we measure the oscillations along the angular direction of the shock cone when penetrating ks coordinates are used . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ks ] we show snapshots of what happens for the model ks2 , physically equivalent to that in fig . [",
    "fig : bl ] .",
    "the oscillations are rather small compared to those observed when bl coordinates are used . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] we show the amplitude of the oscillations when using the two coordinate systems for two representative cases in our table . what we measure is the position of the maximum of the rest mass density along the angular coordinate in radians on a circle of radius @xmath85 ; the maximum is located within the shock cone and is therefore a good quantity to be monitored ; we plot it versus the proper time measured by a detector located at @xmath85 , which appears in figs .",
    "[ fig : bl ] and [ fig : ks ] as a circle .",
    "we identify flip - flop oscillations as those that clearly show the motion of the shock cone in the angular direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] we distinguish at least two important modes when using bl coordinates , one with high frequency and small amplitude and the other with big amplitude and low frequency .",
    "the later is the one associated to the flip - flop motion .",
    "the important observation here , is that when using ks coordinates , only the high frequency mode is observed , that is , the flip - flop mode does not happen .",
    "this clearly indicates that coordinates influence the motion of the shock cone , or what can be more interesting is that a true process of accretion , that is , allowing the gas to really enter the black hole , implies that the flip - flop effect does not take place .",

    "we study numerically the relativistic bondi - hoyle accretion on the equatorial plane on a space - time corresponding to a rotating black hole . our analysis is focused on the shock cone motion of a supersonic gas that is being accreted onto the rotating black hole , and its dependence on the coordinates used to describe the space - time .",
