    "one of the basic points of the standard model is the existence of quarks ( and , of course , corresponding antiquarks ) of 6 different kinds ( flavors ) with different masses : 3 quarks @xmath0 having the electric charge @xmath1 and 3 quarks @xmath2 with the charge @xmath3 .",
    "further , it is widely accepted at present that every ( at least well - studied ) meson consists of one quark and one antiquark having , generally , different flavors .",
    "there is only one exception here : the heaviest @xmath4-quark is so short - living that it has not enough time to produce any hadrons .",
    "such a simple picture provides limitations for quantum numbers of both mesons and baryons .",
    "for instance , baryons can not have positive strangeness @xmath5 , or isospin @xmath6 higher than 3/2 ; mesons can not have @xmath6 higher than 1 , their @xmath5 may be only @xmath7 .",
    "limitations arise also for @xmath8 values : @xmath9 mesons can have , _ e.g.",
    "_ , @xmath10 , but can not have @xmath11 .",
    "note , however , that such a picture is inconsistent with any version of relativistic field theory , where one can not exclude presence of an arbitrary number of virtual quark - antiquark pairs and/or gluons .",
    "therefore , adequate description of any hadron should use a fock column , where lines correspond to particular configurations ( but with the same `` global '' quantum numbers , like @xmath12 and so on ) .    when describing the lower hadron states by the constituent quark model , the model parameters and interaction potentials",
    "are usually chosen so that higher fock components can be ignored , with some accuracy .",
    "it is not evident , however , whether the same approach , with the same parameters and potentials , may be applicable for excited states as well .",
    "up to now , there have been found no mesons with `` non - canonical '' quantum numbers , which could not exist in a quark - antiquark system . nevertheless , there is a tendency to explain any anomalous features of a meson resonance by presence , or even dominance , of tetraquark ( _ i.e. , _ two quark - antiquark pairs ) component(s ) in its structure . as an alternate , one could consider hadron molecules , bound states of two ( or more ) hadrons .",
    "for the first time , such hypotheses were applied to the scalar mesons @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( the corresponding story is briefly presented in the introduction to ref.@xcite ) .",
    "though the discussions are still continuing , the necessity of the tetraquark nature of the scalar mesons stays unproven ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , conclusions in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "later , the tetraquark configurations were searched for in excited @xmath15-mesons , such as @xmath16 and heavier .",
    "the corresponding discussions still arise again and again , but any definite conclusion has not been reached yet , just as for the scalar mesons .",
    "new , and numerous , class of states appropriate to search for tetraquark configurations was revealed about ten years ago , initially in studies at @xmath17-factories .",
    "they are denoted by the symbols @xmath18 .",
    "these states are mainly found in @xmath17-meson decays , but also as a part of cascades in the process @xmath19 .",
    "their common property today is presence of the charmed @xmath20-quark pair among decay products .",
    "the charm may be hidden , as a charmonium state , or open , as a charmed meson pair ( there have been found also several states with the @xmath21-quark pair in decay products ) .",
    "the whole list of observed new states and their decay modes may be found in a number of reviews on this new spectroscopy ( some of more recent talks and papers see , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "even more papers and talks discuss the @xmath18 studies at particular experimental facilities .",
    "all observed states of this group are included also in the report of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that those states are usually seen as peaks in the mass spectra of decay products . meanwhile ,",
    "as known , peaks might arise not only due to resonance states , but also because of some kinematic effects .",
    "it is important in this respect , that the resonance character of the peak has been demonstrated for at least one of @xmath22 states , @xmath23 , by the energy dependence of the phase of the corresponding amplitude  @xcite .",
    "all other peaks @xmath24 are only supposed today to be true resonances ( see , however , more general theoretical arguments against pure kinematic effects in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "but even if all those states were proved to be just resonances it would not mean that we understand their internal structure .",
    "each of them might consist of a familiar quark - antiquark pair , or be a more complicated system .",
    "the most frequent pictures considered in the literature are tetra quarks , bound states consisting of two quarks and two antiquarks , or hadron molecules , bound states of two ( or more ) hadrons .",
    "clear physical discrimination of these pictures is usually not discussed , but methods of calculation may be different .",
    "for instance , tetraquarks are frequently described by sum rules , though various other approaches have been applied as well .",
    "many publications pretend to give satisfactory description of a particular state , but nobody could present a picture of the @xmath18 states as a whole .",
    "thus , their theoretical status stays uncertain .",
    "representative , in this respect , is the fate of ref.@xcite .",
    "its first version was able to see one @xmath22 state , as a result of lattice calculations , while its second version sees no such states in the whole investigated region .",
    "all known states of these kinds are neutral .",
    "being tetraquarks ( with one pair @xmath27 ) or hadron molecule ( of two charmed mesons ) , they could have isospin @xmath28 or 1 .",
    "decay modes do not give a definite answer .",
    "for instance , @xmath29 can decay both to @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 in the final state ) and to @xmath32 ( with @xmath28 ) , which means , of course , isospin violation in one of the channels .",
    "were the @xmath29 isovector , it should have a charged companion .",
    "however , despite intensive searches , no charged companions have been found for any of @xmath33 states .",
    "this favors @xmath28 ( if so , isospin violating should be the decay to @xmath30 ) .",
    "a meson with such quantum numbers and with charmed quark pair ( open or hidden ) in all decay modes could be just an excited state of charmonium .",
    "indeed , the measured @xmath33 masses are close enough to calculated ( alas , model - dependent ) levels of charmonium . for one of such mesons , @xmath34 ,",
    "the particle data group have even made their minds to identify it with a charmonium level , @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "however , calculated ( again , model - dependent ) decay properties differ from the observed ones ( for the particular case of @xmath34 , see ref.@xcite ) . thus ,",
    "identification of @xmath33 mesons as charmonium levels stays questionable , though admissible .",
    "a harder problem is the nature of states @xmath22 .",
    "they have neither strangeness , nor charm , nor beauty , but all their decay modes , observed up to now , contain open or hidden charm ( for @xmath36 states ; there have been found also a couple of states @xmath37 , which decays produce open or hidden beauty ; this makes the problem more general ) . however , all the @xmath22 states are charged and have isospin @xmath31 ( for one of them , @xmath38 , the neutral component , @xmath39 , has been found as well  @xcite ) . therefore , they definitely can not be charmonium ( or bottomonium ) levels .",
    "on the other hand , all the @xmath22 states have rather large widths ( typically , some tens of mev or even more ) .",
    "thus , their decays are governed by strong interactions , which conserve every flavor .",
    "therefore , the final @xmath20- or @xmath21-quarks could not arise as a result of flavor changes in the decay ( as could be in weak decays ) . on the other hand ,",
    "pair production of heavy flavors should be suppressed , according to the zweig - iizuka rule .",
    "these facts provide a hint of presence of the heavy quark pair just in the initial state . were the hint true",
    ", the @xmath22 states would indeed be tetraquarks ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath40 ) or hadron molecules with the same quark content .",
    "such situation is believable , but is not proven yet and stays uncertain . in any case , nobody could achieve general description of the @xmath22 states along such lines .",
    "in the space - time picture , higher fock components are related to quantum fluctuations . when considering hadrons in qcd , those fluctuations may be described either as containing additional @xmath9 pairs and/or gluons ( compare to virtual photons and/or @xmath41 pairs in qed ) , or as two- or multihadron systems .",
    "the fluctuations arise and then disappear after some characteristic time . according to the well - known energy - time uncertainty relation ,",
    "the lifetime of a fluctuation ( in terms of virtual hadrons ) is the shorter , the larger is difference between the initial state mass and physical mass of the virtual hadronic state .",
    "if a hadron under consideration is a resonance state , it has itself some finite lifetime .",
    "let us assume that the resonance has just a canonical quark - antiquark pair as the basic fock component .",
    "now , if a fluctuation develops a ( virtual ) hadron system with its physical mass far above the resonance mass , then the fluctuation has very short lifetime .",
    "it arises and disappears before the resonance decays .",
    "of course , such fluctuation affects properties of the resonance , but only as a correction .",
    "if , just opposite , the resonance mass is far above the threshold of a hadron system in fluctuation , then the arising hadrons turn out to be real .",
    "they rapidly run away after the fluctuation has arisen .",
    "sure , the resonance lifetime in such a case is mainly related not to the time of running away , but to the time ( and probability ) of producing the corresponding fluctuation .",
    "these two extreme considerations show that thresholds may play a special important role . indeed ,",
    "if the fluctuation produces a hadron system in a limited mass range near its threshold , then the fluctuation lifetime may be near or even longer than the resonance lifetime .",
    "in such a case , when describing the resonance , one should consider the fluctuation as permanent . in other words , a near - threshold fluctuation can not be averaged out , it becomes effectively enhanced and `` stabilized '' .",
    "the corresponding fock column for the resonance can not be considered as one - component ; even minimally , it should be two - component . of course , presence of additional fock components should be accounted for when calculating masses and decay properties of the resonances .",
    "phenomenologically , this situation arises if the resonance breit - wigner peak overlaps a threshold . to some extent ,",
    "the case is similar to the known cusp effect , which provides enhancement of an elastic cross section in a narrow energy range near an inelastic threshold ( discussion of the @xmath22-states in respect with cusps may be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "just as for cusps , the largest contributions to the higher fock components should come from hadron pairs in the near - threshold @xmath5-wave state .    among the `` old '' resonances , some cases seem to encounter just such threshold effects .",
    "they are , first of all , the scalar resonances @xmath14 and @xmath13 , mentioned above as `` prehistoric '' tetraquarks .",
    "their masses and widths  @xcite are such that the breit - wigner peaks overlap the @xmath42 threshold . moreover , the resonance masses are so close to the kaon - pair threshold(s ) that the resonance properties are affected by the difference of thresholds for the charged and neutral kaon pairs .",
    "this distorts isotopic relation between kaons and produces apparent isospin violation , thus generating the observable @xmath43-@xmath44 mixing .",
    "the other interesting example is the hyperon resonance @xmath45",
    ". its decay to @xmath46 has , formally , no energy release and , therefore , vanishing final - state phase space . at first sight ,",
    "it should be kinematically forbidden or , at least , suppressed . however , the branching ratio for the mode @xmath47 is unexpectedly large , about 10%  @xcite",
    ". it could be just a result of the threshold enhancement .",
    "this discussion shows that higher fock components can not be completely expelled .",
    "one may be able to construct a model and adjust its parameters so to describe the lowest hadron states ( nearly ) without higher components .",
    "but for excited states , those components , most probably , will occur non - negligible .",
    "of course , such expectations are equally applicable to both mesons and baryons .",
    "note that the arising picture differs from the two approaches most popular in the literature .",
    "for instance , a meson with such structure is not a canonical tetraquark , since it contains a quark - antiquark component .",
    "hence , it may have only quantum numbers which are admissible for the quark - antiquark pair ; in terms of the @xmath48 , it can belong only to the lowest multuplets . on the other side , the hadron component of such",
    "a meson is not a bound molecule , it is dominated by the hadron near - threshold system .",
    "let us apply the above viewpoint to the @xmath29 , with mass @xmath49  mev , width @xmath50  mev , and @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "we assume that its lowest component corresponds to @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "then , it overlaps the threshold of @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) at 3871.8  mev , but not the threshold of @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) at 3879.9  mev  @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath29 , because of its spin - parity , is not coupled to @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the corresponding fock component can contain only neutral @xmath15-meson contribution ( in terms of the quark content , it may be considered as the tetraquark configuration @xmath57 ) .",
    "evidently , it is composed of two isospins , @xmath28 and @xmath31 , with equal intensity .",
    "this may explain why the decays of @xmath29 to @xmath58 and @xmath59 have near the same branchings , if these decays go mainly through rescattering of @xmath15-mesons .",
    "on the other side , radiative decays to charmonium states could be mainly determined by the @xmath60 component .",
    "thus , accurate studies of the resonance decays may reveal presence of several essential fock components and separate their contributions .    as another example , let us consider a particular @xmath22-state , @xmath61 with @xmath62 , observed in decays to @xmath63 ( experimental information on this state is briefly reviewed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it has mass about 4480  mev and width about 200  mev  @xcite .",
    "evidently , its main decays should be governed by strong interactions . most probably , they conserve isospin and , therefore , @xmath64-parity . if so , then the @xmath61 has @xmath65 .",
    "if widths of both initial and final mesons are taken into account , then the @xmath23 overlaps the threshold of @xmath66 ( or charge conjugate )  @xcite .",
    "one may expect that these final states are related with the higher fock component of the @xmath23 ; then they will provide more intensive modes in decays of @xmath23 than @xmath67 ( though more difficult for observation )",
    ". it would be important to search for this decay by detailed studying the produced system @xmath68 .    in terms of quark content ,",
    "both @xmath69 and @xmath70 provide evidence for the tetraquark fock component @xmath71 in @xmath72 .",
    "if this meson contains also a canonical quark - antiquark component , it should be @xmath73 .",
    "such component may develop decays of @xmath23 without any charm , with final states ( m.b .",
    ", through cascade stages ) of pure pion systems .",
    "positive @xmath64-parity means that there should be an even number of final pions .",
    "the lightest meson with @xmath65 , @xmath74 , has mass about 1230  mev , width about 140  mev , and decays mainly to @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "having the heavier mass , @xmath72 , most probably , produces @xmath76 pions , at least one of which should be neutral .",
    "it seems to be very difficult to search for such heavy resonance in such multipion system ( note , in particular , enormous combinatorial background ) .",
    "this was not even attempted up to now .",
    "however , it is worth to do , since detection of the pure pion decays would clarify the nature of @xmath23 , as well as other @xmath18 mesons .",
    "canonical picture of mesons as quark - antiquark systems is not self - consistent in relaticistic theories .",
    "it can ( and seems to ) be , nevertheless , a good approximation for light mesons , after appropriate adjustment of parameters for the corresponding models .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the situation changes for heavier mesons , where one or more higher components of a fock column should be accounted for .",
    "it is especially so , if the breit - wigner peak of the meson ( or baryon as well ) resonance overlaps a threshold of pair of lighter hadrons .",
    "then the higher fock component(s ) , with multi - quark content , may be most readily presented as a near - threshold hadron pair in the @xmath5-wave state .",
    "such a picture opens a new possible direction to investigate the mysterious set of mesons @xmath77 different from tetraquark or molecular approaches , popular in the literature .",
    "accurate ( though difficult ) experimental study of their various decay modes can allow to separate various fock components . to demonstrate existence of a genuine tetraquark ( without a @xmath9 component ) one should find a meson with non - canonical flavor quantum numbers , forbidden for a quark - antiquark configuration , either appended by gluon(s ) or not .",
