    "recent experiments@xcite with yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3-nb ramp long josephson junctions ( ljj ) fabricated in zigzag geometry ( if viewed from the top ) clearly demonstrated that such a ljj consists of alternating facets of @xmath5 , @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 junctions .",
    "the presence of alternating @xmath5 and @xmath0-facets results in a set of @xmath0-discontinuities of the josephson phase at the corners where @xmath5- and @xmath0-facets join .",
    "these are the points where the order parameter of the anisotropic high-@xmath4 superconductor changes its sign because the direction of the josephson contact changes by @xmath7 .    in the _ short facet limit _",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the zigzag ljj was investigated theoretically and experimentally@xcite . due to alternating @xmath5 and @xmath0 facets",
    "the critical current @xmath9 has a rather small value at zero magnetic field @xmath10 , while the main peaks of @xmath9 are found at a finite field , the expression for which was derived too and fits well with numerical simulations and experiments ( considering flux focusing ) .",
    "a striking property of 0-@xmath0 ljj is the spontaneous generation of half - integer flux quanta , further called semifluxons ( sfs ) , at the corners of a zigzag .",
    "the presence of sfs was demonstrated experimentally@xcite by scanning squid microscopy on ljjs in the _ long facet limit_. sfs were also experimentally observed in the so - called tri - crystal grain boundary ljjs @xcite . in both experiments the samples were electrically disconnected .    in this work",
    "we investigate numerically the behavior of positive and negative sfs ( psf and nsf ) in a ljj of zigzag geometry .",
    "the polarity of sfs is defined so that the psf roughly corresponds to spontaneous magnetic flux @xmath11 , while nsf corresponds to @xmath12 . in particular , we study the various ground states in which sfs of different polarity can be arranged in ljjs with many discontinuity points .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the bias current , and show that it may provoke formation of sfs even in the cases when the ground state has a piecewise constant phase at zero bias .",
    "the rearrangement of the psfs and nsfs under the effect of uniform bias current at zero voltage is discovered and may be observed in experiments similar to the one of ref .  . throughout the paper",
    "we consider separately the cases of infinitely long jj and of ljj of finite length . among different ground states we focus on antiferromagnetically ordered chains of sfs ( at zero bias ) and on chains of unipolar sfs .",

    "to understand the formation of ground states in various configurations it is important to be able to calculate the energy of the system . since the sine - gordon eq",
    "( [ eq : final : mu : norm ] ) differs from the usual equation only by a factor in front of @xmath53 , the energy of the system in the general case can be written as @xmath54 now we present the results on the observation of different ground states and the spontaneous formation of sfs .      when we speak about infinitely long jj we mean that its both edges are very far from the positions of discontinuity points , fluxons , sfs and any other `` interesting '' locations .",
    "for our purposes we used @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) as a good approximation provided that sfs are at least @xmath57 apart from the edges .",
    "for some cases we repeated the simulations using @xmath58 and @xmath59 , but the results were _ quantitatively _ the same with accuracy of few percents .",

    "note , that in principle the polarity of sf does not depend on the sign of the @xmath0-discontinuity . both psf and nsf may be pinned at a @xmath17 or a @xmath63 discontinuity ( [ eq : theta1 ] ) and have the same energy .",

    "( [ eq : u_sf ] ) .",
    "this is the rest energy of a sf .",
    "second , we simulated a ljj with * two discontinuity points * at @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the initial phase distribution was chosen so that @xmath73 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath74 when we look at the temporal evolution of the system we see that such a state is meta - stable and occasionally degrades into two sfs of opposite polarity : a psf and a nsf .",
    "the polarity of a particular sf does not depend on its position and on the direction of @xmath0 jump , but depends on the initial perturbation which we used to disturb the meta - stable state .",
    "for example , when we applied a tiny uniform bias current @xmath75 , we got a nsf at @xmath76 and a psf at @xmath77 .",
    "if we apply a bias current of opposite polarity , @xmath78 , we get a psf at @xmath76 and a nsf at @xmath77 .",
    "this looks natural since , for our choice of current direction , the lorenz ( driving ) force associated with the positive current pushes positive ( semi-)fluxons to the right and negative ones to the left .",
    "thus , the final configuration always corresponds to a pair of sfs pulled apart by the bias current .",
    "the states of two sfs discussed above , and naturally denoted as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , are stable only when the distance between sfs is rather large , @xmath81 . otherwise , in the short facet limit , @xmath82 , the state without sfs is energetically more favorable .",
    "the numerical simulations show that the critical separation is @xmath83 .",
    "the superscript stands for @xmath84 , as below we also calculate @xmath85 for the case of more than two corners .",
    "we have also checked that there is no hysteresis ( local energy minimum ) around @xmath85 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if we start with two sfs at @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , the system relaxes to the @xmath65 state ( [ eq : flatstate ] ) . inversely ,",
    "if we start from the flat state ( [ eq : flatstate ] ) at @xmath88 , it relaxes to the @xmath80 or @xmath79 state .",
    "continuing our reasoning in a similar fashion , we conclude that for odd @xmath21 in an infinite ljj , the formation of at least one sf is always energetically profitable . in a ljj with even @xmath21 ,",
    "there is a crossover distance @xmath85 ( which is a function of facet number , size and location ) which determines the ground state . for equidistantly distributed corners",
    "the crossover distances @xmath89 were calculated numerically for different number of corners @xmath21 .",
    "they have the following values : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 . for odd @xmath21 the state with @xmath21 afm - ordered sfs",
    "is always favored , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath93 . in the general case ,",
    "the situation can also be mixed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf - nsf - o - pi ] , _ i.e. _ , the shorter facet @xmath94@xmath95 with @xmath96 has constant @xmath97 , while the longer facet @xmath98@xmath99 with @xmath100 has a psf - nsf pair at the discontinuity points .        another case which we did nt consider up to now",
    "is * two psf * @xmath101 ( or two nsf @xmath102 ) .",
    "these states are stable for any separation @xmath103 . for @xmath104 , the profile of two",

    "the energy of the @xmath80 state changes from @xmath108 down to 0 as @xmath103 decreases from infinity to zero , having @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "although , the energy of the @xmath101 state is always higher than the one of the @xmath80 state , it is still stable and represents a local energy minimum .",
    "we consider here only the case of equidistant distribution of the corners along the length of the ljj .",
    "the @xmath21 corners can be distributed in two different symmetric ways with the positions of the corners : @xmath112 where @xmath103 is the facet length ( the distance between corners ) , and @xmath113 . in the first case ,",
    "all facets have equal length ( ef stands for `` equal facets '' ) , but for even @xmath21 the total lengths of @xmath5- and @xmath0-facets are not equal @xmath114 . in the second case , the first and the last facets are twice shorter , but the total lengths of 0- and @xmath0-facets",

    "the case of one corner@xcite is degenerate and belongs to both categories .    in the analysis below",

    "later we also analyze unipolar states .",
    "all other configurations , although stable , are outside the scope of this paper .",

    "_ at @xmath116 the ground state consists of afm - ordered sfs , since it is not profitable to have long facets with @xmath97 .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath121 .",
    "thus the ground state is a flat phase state .",
    "since we have different limiting behaviors at @xmath111 and @xmath116 , there should be a crossover distance @xmath122 and a corresponding crossover ljj length @xmath123 .",
    "our simulations for @xmath84 show that @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . for @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . for @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "\\(b ) _ facets of equal length , odd @xmath21 , @xmath115 .",
    "_ the simplest example @xmath132 was already investigated@xcite . at @xmath116 the ground state",
    "consists of afm - ordered sfs . at @xmath111 the flat phase state and",
    "the afm - ordered sf states have the same energy ( in the first approximation ) , so it is reasonable to assume that for all @xmath103 @xmath133@xcite , and the ground state is a @xmath134 chain .",
    "this is also confirmed by numerical simulations of a @xmath134 sf chain put in ljjs of different lengths .",
    "\\(c ) _ twice shorter edge facets , @xmath115 . _",
    "the ground state is equivalent to the previous case and confirmed by simulations .",
    "the last state which we wish to consider is @xmath101 ( or @xmath102 ) .",
    "to avoid problems with initial conditions , we have created a @xmath101 state in a ljj of @xmath135 , and have slowly reduced the length of the ljj in steps of @xmath136 , allowing the system to relax after each small contraction .",
    "we have found that for each separation @xmath103 there is a critical ljj length @xmath137 , such that at @xmath138 two psfs can not stay inside the junction .",
    "they emit a fluxon and revert either to @xmath80 state or to the flat phase state .",
    "the plot of @xmath139 _ vs. _ @xmath103 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc(a ) ] .     still exists on the distance @xmath103 between sfs . ]    at @xmath104 our two psfs are equivalent to a fluxon .",
    "the pinning disappears too , as a @xmath140-discontinuity is equivalent to a continuous phase for our problem .",
    "a fluxon placed in a ljj of any finite length is in a metastable state because it is attracted by two images situated behind the left and the right edges of the ljj .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 of course , in the experiment , the force pulling the fluxon towards the boundary is exponentially small for large @xmath142 , and the fluxon gets pinned by non - uniformities or other mechanisms , provided they have a stronger effect than _",
    "e.g. _ thermal fluctuations , which depin the fluxon .    in the opposite limit @xmath143 ,",
    "two psfs become independent and @xmath144 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we should solve a problem of sf stability near the edge of a semi - infinite ljj .",
    "this problem , in turn , is equivalent to the problem of stability of a psf - nsf pair ( the nsf appears as an image ) in the infinite ljj analyzed above .",
    "therefore , the sf is stable at the distance from the edge which is larger than @xmath145 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath143 , @xmath139 grows linearly with @xmath103 , but is shifted by @xmath146 .",
    "the asymptote @xmath147 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lc(a ) ] and demonstrates excellent agreement of our arguments with numerical simulation .",
    "an interesting question is what happens when a uniform dc bias current is applied to the system .",
    "the current acts like a driving force which tries to push sf in a certain direction ( just like with fluxons ) which depends on the polarity of the sf and on the polarity of the bias current . on the other hand sfs",
    "are pinned by the phase discontinuity points and , it seems , the maximum what can happen is that the sf changes the shape ( deforms ) a little bit .",
    "in contrast , we found that the sf can also ( a ) spontaneously flip and generate a fluxon which starts moving along the ljj under the action of a bias current , and ( b ) several psfs and nsfs can hop simultaneously , if they are situated close enough , resulting in a structural rearrangement .",
    "first , we simulated a ljj with only one discontinuity point . according to the results presented in the previous section ,",
    "the ground state is a sf . without loosing generality",
    "let us assume that it is a psf .",
    "when we apply the positive bias current from zero up to @xmath148 the psf just changes shape . at @xmath149 the psf becomes unstable and splits into a positive fluxon and a nsf , so that the total flux is conserved .",
    "the fluxon moves away to the right under the action of the driving force . the nsf is still pinned but exposed to the same driving force @xmath150 which tries to push it to the left .",
    "correspondingly the nsf splits into a negative fluxon ( anti - fluxon ) and a psf .",
    "the anti - fluxon moves away to the left being driven by the bias current .",
    "thus , after emission of a fluxon and an anti - fluxon , the system returns to the initial state with one trapped psf .",
    "since @xmath150 , the whole process is repeated again , _",
    "i.e. _ , a sf of any polarity at @xmath150 emits two trains of fluxons : fluxons to the right and anti - fluxons to the left .     shows the emerging sfs for @xmath151 in ljj of @xmath55 with the distance @xmath96 between corners .",
    "the pre - critical state at @xmath152 is shown by thicker line . ]",
    "second , we simulated the behavior of a ljj with two corners at a distance @xmath103 between them . when the distance @xmath153 ( we took @xmath96 for simulations ) , the ground state corresponds to the flat phase profile . nevertheless , if one applies a bias current , a nsf ",
    "psf pair is formed .",
    "the sfs of this pair are pinned at the corresponding discontinuity points and the polarity of the sfs is such that the bias current pulls them apart . the amplitude ( the field at the center of the psf ) of the nsf ",
    "psf pair grows smoothly with the applied bias current and reaches the value @xmath154 at @xmath155 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bearingsfs ] .",
    "this value of field is only twice smaller than the field in the center of an isolated sf , which is equal to @xmath156 .",
    "this means that _ even in the short facet limit a nsf ",
    "psf pair can be observed experimentally@xcite by applying a uniform dc bias current through the junction_. at @xmath150 , the nsf ",
    "psf pair emits fluxons to the right and anti - fluxons to the left ( for positive bias current ) , and , thus , switches to the non - zero voltage state .",
    "another possibility is that the distance between two corners @xmath103 is larger than @xmath146 ( we took @xmath100 for simulations ) . in this case",
    "the ground state can be either of @xmath102 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath101 , depending on the history of the system . under the action of the applied bias current , the states @xmath102 and @xmath101 behave very similar to a single sf state discussed above .",
    "the most interesting thing happens when we apply the bias current to the @xmath79 or @xmath80 configuration , especially if the initial order of nsf and psf is not natural with respect to the direction of bias current .",
    "suppose that we have the state @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath157 the direction of driving force is such that the nsf and the psf are pushed towards each other , but still they can not move since they are pinned at the corners .",
    "only their shape changes a little bit as @xmath158 increases . at @xmath159 ,",
    "we observe that the sfs flip synchronously , and exchange their location .",
    "we can denote such a process as @xmath80@xmath160@xmath79 .",
    "this process can be thought as an exchange by a _ virtual _",
    "fluxon which transfers a quantum of magnetic flux from the psf to the nsf : @xmath161 @xmath162 we use the word _ virtual _ because ( a ) no actual soliton is formed ( only a quantum of magnetic flux spills over ) , and ( b ) this happens at the value of @xmath158 which is much less than the fluxon creation current @xmath163 discussed above .",
    "the process of flipping ( or hopping psf@xmath164nsf ) of sfs is accompanied by emission of plasma waves in both directions , but they decay with time , so that the final state @xmath79 is stable . in this new state",
    "the bias current pulls the sfs apart and only when @xmath158 exceeds @xmath165 the system switches to non - zero voltage state .",
    "if the system was initially in the state @xmath79 , no structural rearrangement takes place for @xmath166 and the system switches to the resistive state at @xmath167 .",
    "thus , _ by sweeping the bias current back and forth between @xmath168 and @xmath169 one may observe@xcite the structural rearrangements of sfs being in zero voltage state_.    similar rearrangements we observe for the states involving many sfs .",
    "usually we start from an array of afm - ordered sfs at @xmath170 with the distance @xmath100 between nearest neighbors .",
    "then we increase the bias current to obtain the following structural transformations .    for 4 sfs : @xmath171 with @xmath172 from the state @xmath173 .    for 6 sfs : @xmath174 with @xmath175 from the state @xmath176 . in the latter case the bias",
