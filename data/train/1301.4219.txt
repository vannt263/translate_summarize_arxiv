    "extremely large size waves ( commonly known as freak , rogue or giant waves ) are very common in the open sea or ocean and they pose major hazard to mariners . as early as 1976 , peregrine @xcite suggested that in the region of oceans where there is a strong current present , freak waves can form when action is conncentrated by reflection into a caustic region .",
    "a variable current acts analogously to filamentation instability in laser - plasma interactions @xcite .",
    "freak waves are very steep and is a nonlinear phenomena , hence they can not be represented and described by a linear water wave theory .",
    "zakharov @xcite in 2009 has noted that in the last stage of their evolution , their steepness becomes ` infinite ' , thereby forming a ` wall of water ' .",
    "however , before such an instant in time , the steepness is higher than one for the limiting stokes wave and before breaking the wave crest reaches three to four ( sometimes even more ) times higher than the crests of neighboring waves .",
    "the freak wave is preceded by a deep trough appearing as a ` hole in the sea ' . on the other hand ,",
    "a characteristic life time of a freak wave is short , typically ten of wave periods or so .",
    "for example , if the wave period is fifteen seconds , then their life time is just few minutes .",
    "freak wave appears almost instantly from a relatively calm sea .",
    "it is , therefore , easy to appreciate that such peculiar features of freak waves can not be explained by means of a linear theory .",
    "even the focusing of ocean waves is a preconditions for formation of such waves .",
    "it is now quite common to associate appearance of freak waves with the modulation instability of stokes waves .",
    "this instability ( known as the benjamin  feir instability ) was first discovered by lighthill @xcite and the detail of theory was developed independently by benjamin and feir @xcite and by zakharov @xcite .",
    "zakharov showed slowly modulated weakly nonlinear stokes wave can be described by nonlinear shrdinger equation ( nlse ) and that this equation is integrable @xcite and is just the first term in the hierarchy of envelope equations describing packets of surface gravity waves .",
    "the second term in this hierarchy was calculated by dysthe @xcite .    since the pioneer work of smith @xcite , many researchers attempted ( both theoretically or numerically ) to explain the freak wave formation by nlse . among diverse results obtained by them",
    "there is one important common observation which has been made by all , and that is , nonlinear development of modulational instability leads to concentration of wave energy in a small spatial region .",
    "this marks the possibility for formation of freak wave .",
    "modulation instability leads to decomposition of initially homogeneous stokes wave into a system of envelope solitons , or more strictly quasi - solitons @xcite .",
    "this state can be called ` solitonic turbulence ' , or ` quasisolitonic turbulence ' .    in this letter , we consider the problem of a single solition in a homogeneous media , being subjected to modulational instability which eventually leads to formation of a system of soliton .",
    "we will show that the supercritical instability leads to maximum formation of soliton , concentrated in a small region . in going through subcritical instability the solitons coagulate to early stages of supercritical instability .",
    "moreover , we investigate the full dynamics of nonlinearly interacting deep water waves subjected to modulational / filamentation instabilities , and we find that random perturbations can grow to form inherently nonlinear water wave structures , the so called freak waves , through the nonlinear interaction between two coupled water waves .",
    "the latter should be of interest for explaining recent observations in water wave dynamics .",
    "in a pioneering work , a theory for the modulational instability of a pair of two - dimensional nonlinearly coupled water waves in deep water , as well as the formation and dynamics of localized freak wave packets was presented @xcite .",
    "the two wave packets were investigated in the context of nonlinear optics by @xcite , in bise - einsten condensates by @xcite , in transmission by @xcite , and in plasmas by many other authors @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the two - dimensional cnls equations in the following form @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the amplitudes of the slowly varying wave envelopes .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 components of the group velocity are given respectively by @xmath6 and the group velocity dispersion coefficients are @xmath7 also , the nonlinearity coefficients ( as in @xcite ) are given by @xmath8 and @xmath9    here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are wavenumbers and @xmath12 is the wave frequency .",
    "they are related by @xmath13 ( the dispersion relation for deep water waves @xcite ) with @xmath14 the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath15 the wavenumber norm given by @xmath16 . for detail description of the formulation of the problem",
    ", we refer to the original works @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear strongly coupled system of equations ( [ cnlse1 ] ) and ( [ cnlse2 ] ) will be computed using a fast numerical algorithm based on the spectral method @xcite which is explained below .",
    "we first noticed that by letting @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the system ( [ cnlse1 ] ) and ( [ cnlse2 ] ) becomes symmetric , obtained from ( [ cnlse1 ] ) and ( [ cnlse2 ] ) @xmath19 where @xmath20\\ ] ]    then , we reduce the above system of pdes ( [ eq1])([eq2 ] ) into a system of odes using the fourier transform of @xmath21 which is defined by @xmath22 with the corresponding inverse @xmath23 the function @xmath24 can be interpreted as the amplitude density of @xmath25 for wavenumbers @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "now , we take the fourier transform of both ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) as @xmath28 @xmath29    letting @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) can be written in the matrix form as @xmath32    computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors the solution to ( [ eq8 ] ) can be written as @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we exploit the symmetry of the nonlinear function @xmath36 from ( [ eq5 ] ) in developing a numerical procedure to solve the system of odes ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "we discretize the spatial domain @xmath37 \\times [ -l/2,l/2]$ ] into @xmath38 uniformly spaced grid points @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 even , and @xmath42 the length of the rectangular mesh @xmath43 .",
    "given @xmath44 , we define the 2d discrete fourier transform ( 2dft ) of @xmath25 as @xmath45 and its inverse 2dft as @xmath46 in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) the wavenumbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the spatial indexes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , take only integer values . +      we solve the initial value problem of the ode system ( [ eq8 ] ) using the classical fourth order runge - kutta ( rk4 ) method and exact treatment for the linear part @xcite .",
    "given @xmath49 , we discretize the time domain @xmath50 $ ] with equal time steps of size @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and define @xmath53 and @xmath54 . initializing @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we compute the fourier transforms of the nonlinear terms @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and advanced the ode ( [ eq8 ] ) in time with time step @xmath51 using the explicit rk4 for the nonlinear part , together with an exact solution for the linear part as shown in ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the numerical code for the above procedure is implemented in fortran 90 and executed on a linux cluster .",
    "the initial profiles for @xmath2 and @xmath3 were taken as gaussians , @xmath59    in the simulations reported here , we used the parameter values @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and a grid of @xmath68 nodes in the computational domain @xmath69\\times[-1,1]$ ] with the time step size @xmath70 .    for each simulation",
    "we monitor the energies @xmath71 and @xmath72 , calculated as @xmath73 @xmath74    observing a finite energy will reveal stability of a solution . as soon as the solution becomes unstable , the energy diverges . when the solution dissipates the energy approaches to zero .",

    "we remark for considerable period after the initial step , waves @xmath2 and @xmath3 are qualitatively the same ( with @xmath87 ) before the nonlinear wave - wave interactions set in which results to wave break - up .    in summary",
    ", we presented a numerical procedure to solve cnls equations describing modulational instabilities of a pair of nonlinearly interacting two - dimensional waves in deep water .",
    "the simulation results of the full dynamical system reveals that even waves that are separately modulationally stable can , when nonlinear interactions are taken into account , give rise to novel behavior such as the formation of large - amplitude coherent wave packets with amplitudes several times the initial waves .",
    "this behavior is quite different from that of a single wave ( the case for the original benjamin - feir instability ) which disintegrates into a wide spectrum of waves .",
    "these results are relevant to the nonlinear instability arising from colliding water waves thereby producing large - amplitude oceanic freak waves ."
