    "much on our speculations on _ how _ bulges originated depend on what we believe on _ when _ they formed . some scenarios prefer bulges to be young , or middle age , late comers anyway .",
    "others prefer a rapid , early build up of bulges , and push back to very early times the epoch of their formation . for this reason i will mostly concentrate on reviewing evidence on ages , leaving the last section to speculations on origins .",
    "while they may provide additional clues , some morphological and dynamical properties  such as bars , ripples , or peanut shapes  are largely ignored in this review .",
    "section 2 focuses on the galactic bulge , the one we can study best , and in all details",
    ". next closer bulge to us is that of m31 , to which section 3 is dedicated .",
    "no other prominent bulge exists in the local group ( m33 does not really have a bulge ) , and section 4 emphasizes that most bulges of spirals are quite similar to ellipticals , so the problem of bulge ages merges with that of dating ellipticals , and becomes the more general problem of dating _",
    "spheroids_. this is the subject of section 5 , i.e. dating spheroids at low , as well as high redshifts . in section 6 cluster and field early - type galaxies",
    "are compared to each other , and section 7 , on speculations , is last .",
    "overall , a wide body of observational evidences is presented showing that the bulk of stellar populations in galactic spheroids are very old .",
    "this is true all the way from the bulge of our own galaxy to high redshift cluster ellipticals .",
    "the main issue that remains open is whether star formation and assembly of spheroids were concomitant events , or whether the bulk of stars formed in smaller entities that then hierarchically coalesced , with this process extending over much of the cosmological time .",
    "dating of bulge stars is complicated by several factors , such as crowding , depth effects , variable reddening , metallicity dispersion , and contamination by foreground disk stars . in an attempt to circumvent some of these limitations ortolani et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have selected the bulge globular clusters ngc 6528 and ngc 6553 for hst study .",
    "these clusters are respectively located at @xmath1 and @xmath2 from the galactic center , and their overall metallicity [ m / fe ] is about solar ( barbuy et al .",
    "1999 ) , close to the average for stars in baade s window ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) . like most other clusters within @xmath3 kpc from the galactic center , they belong to the population of bulge globular clusters , having the same kinematical properties and metallicity distribution of bulge stars ( e.g. minniti 1995 ) .",
    "( to qualify these clusters as _ disk clusters _ is clearly a misnomer . )",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "1 shows the cmd of ngc 6553 as sampled by the pc1 chip of wfpc2 , that combines good statistics with relatively low differential reddening .",
    "superimposed on it is the mean locus of the cmd of ngc 6528 as sampled by the wf2 chip of wfpc2 .",
    "the data points of ngc 6553 have been dereddened as indicated in the lower panel so to make its turnoff color equal to that of ngc 6528 .",
    "then the cmd of this latter cluster has been shifted vertically to bring its horizontal branch ( hb ) to coincide with that of ngc 6553 .",
    "note that the mean locus of ngc 6528 provides an excellent fit to the ngc 6553 data , from the ms all the way to the tip of the rgb .",
    "the virtual identity of the cmd of the two clusters is further demonstrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 , where the men loci of the two clusters are compared to each other .    also shown in the lower panel of fig . 1 is the mean locus of the inner halo globular cluster 47 tuc ( [ fe / h]=0.7 ) , which has been shifted in color and magnitude in order to bring into coincidence its hb with that of the two bulge clusters .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the luminosity difference between the hb and the main sequence turnoff of the the bulge clusters is the same ( or even slightly larger ) of that of 47 tuc .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that the two bulge clusters are as old as the halo clusters ( to within @xmath4 gyr ) , and therefore the bulge underwent rapid chemical enrichment to solar abundance and beyond , very early in the evolution of our galaxy . due to the _ relative _ nature of the dating procedure ,",
    "this conclusion is independent of uncertainties in reddening , distance , and _ absolute _",
    "age determinations .",
    "the next step in the ortolani et al .",
    "study is represented by an attempt at dating the bulge _ field _ stellar population itself , still in a relative fashion with respect to the clusters .",
    "2 shows that the ms luminosity function of the cluster ngc 6528 is indistinguishable from that of the stars in baade s window ( the low - reddening bulge field at @xmath5 from the galaxy center ) , that was obtained from observations with the eso ntt with superb seeing ( @xmath6 ) . from this comparison ortolani",
    "et al . infer that the whole bulge formed quickly , some 15 gyr ago ( if this is the age of the halo clusters ) , and set an upper limit of @xmath7 by number to any intermediate age population in the bulge .",
    "indeed , a larger proportion of intermediate age stars would have resulted in a shallower fall off of the bulge luminosity function around to ( i.e. , for @xmath8 ) , where instead it coincides with that of the cluster .",
    "further insight on the formation time scale of the bulge comes from the detailed abundance studies of bulge stars . in 12 field",
    "k giants mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) find a moderate @xmath9-element enhancement ( [ mg / fe]@xmath10[ti / fe]@xmath10 + 0.3 , but with [ ca / fe]@xmath10[si / fe]@xmath11 ) , moderate r - process element enhancement , while s - process elements appear solar with respect to iron .",
    "barbuy et al . ( 1999 ) have analyzed 2 stars in ngc 6553 finding somewhat more enhanced @xmath9-element overabundance , with [ na / fe]@xmath10[al / fe]@xmath10[ti / fe]@xmath10 + 0.6 and [ o / fe]@xmath10[mg / fe]@xmath10[si / fe]@xmath10 + 0.3 .",
    "note that different systematcs may go a long way towards explaining the differences between these two studies .",
    "general consensus exists on the interpretation of @xmath9-element and r - process element enhancements as due to a _",
    "quick _ star formation and metal enrichment , with elements produced by type ii supernovae being incorporated into new stars before the bulk of iron from type ia sns is produced .",
    "however , how quick is _ quick _ remains uncertain .",
    "basically , the bulk of stars must form before the explosion of most snta s , but the actual _ distribution _ of snia explosion times following a burst of star formation remains empirically indetermined and theoretically very model dependent ( cf .",
    "greggio 1996 ) .",
    "according to general wisdom it takes at least @xmath12 gyr for a fair fraction of snia to release their iron .",
    "if so , at least 90% of the bulge stars formed within the first gyr of the object that we now call the milky way . in conclusion , the _ fossil _ evidence tells us that the whole galactic spheroid is pretty old indeed , and formed on a rather short timescale",
    ".    there are important lessons to draw from these conclusions .",
    "our milky way is a rather late - type spiral galaxy in a very loose group that is located rather away from major density peaks in the distribution of galaxies . nevertheless , her whole spheroidal component looks @xmath13 one hubble time old , from the halo globular clusters all the way to the inner bulge . with a mass of @xmath14 ,",
    "the old age for the bulk of the spheroidal population implies an average star formation rate @xmath15 at the epoch of spheroid formation , some 14 - 15 gyr ago ( having assumed @xmath16 yr for the duration of the star formation process ) .",
    "this value is as small as the smallest star formation rates of @xmath17 galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "such galaxies have also effective radii of 1 - 3 kpc ( typical of galactic bulges , cf .",
    "giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 ) , and it is rather tempting to speculate that with lyman - break galaxies one may have caught bulge formation in the action . with the galactic spheroid accounting for @xmath18 of the stellar mass of the milky way , one can conclude that @xmath19 of all stars in our galaxy have formed `` at fairly high redshift '' .",
    "in ground based and pre - costar hst studies the suspicion had been advanced for the presence in the bulge of m31 of a major intermediate - age component , as suggested by the detection of putative bright agb stars ( e.g. rich & mould 1991 ; rich , mould , & graham 1993 ; rich & mighell 1995 ; davidge et al .",
    "however , bright agb stars ( @xmath20 ) are also produced by old , metal rich globular clusters , such as the bulge clusters discussed in the previous section ( frogel & elias 1988 ; guarnieri , renzini , & ortolani 1997 ) . moreover , with insufficient angular resolution blends of rgb stars can be mistaken for bright agb stars ( e.g. renzini 1998b ) , and the presence of an intermediate age population in the bulge of m31 could not be unquestionably proven with such data .",
    "wfpc2 observations of the bulge of m31 are now becoming available .",
    "jablonka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have obtained deep cmds for various locations in the bulge of m31 , confirming that what on low resolution images appeared as _ bright agb stars _ are indeed blends of fainter stars .",
    "3 shows one of such cmds , relative to the field in the vicinity of the very metal rich globular cluster g170 , located at a projected distance of 1.55 kpc from the center of m31 .",
    "the cmd of the field near the cluster g177 ( at 0.8 kpc from the center ) is virtually identical .",
    "perhaps the most stryking aspect of this cmd is the predominance of a fairly homogeneous metal rich population , with the upper rgb bending down in the @xmath21 cmd due to strong tio blanketing as typical of metal rich globular clusters ( see fig .",
    "very few metal poor star appear to be present , while the bulk of stars are more metal rich than [ fe / h]=0.25 .    in conclusion",
    ", there is no evidence for an intermediate age population in the bulge of m31 .",
    "its almost uniformly metal rich population points to the presence of a `` g - dwarf problem '' , which may be a general characteristics of ( at least ) the inner regions of galactic spheroids ( e.g. greggio 1997 ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the m31 bulge may provide important insight for understanding the formation process .",
    "it rises two intriguing questions : 1 ) where are the stars that produced the metals now locked in the bulge stars we see ? and 2 ) where have the metals produced by this bulge sellar population gone ?",
    "the tentative answer to the first question is `` they are out in the halo of m31 '' , which could be tested extending deep hst imaging to larger galactocentric distances ( but see rich , mighell , & neill 1996 ) .",
    "the tentative answer to the second question is `` they have been ejected out in the igm by an early galactic wind '' .",
    "if these are the correct answers , then the even more tentative conclusion is that the bulge formed outside - in by dissipative merging and collapse of mostly gaseous pregalactic lumps . with the resulting starburst then ejecting the residual gas and a lot of metals along with it .",
    "the properties of bulges are extensively reviewed at this meeting , and there is no point trying to summarize them here . in this section",
    "i would like to emphasize only one aspect : the close similarity of the bulges of spiral galaxies with elliptical galaxies . while also this aspect is further illustrated by others at this meeting , fig .",
    "4 gives a very direct impression of the extent to which bulges are similar to ellipticals ( from jablonka , martin , & arimoto 1996 ) , and therefore may share a common origin .",
    "the bulk of bulges appear to follow precisely the same mg@xmath22 relation of ellipticals , with just a minority of them ( i.e. 5 out of 26 in the jablonka et al .",
    "sample ) having mg@xmath0 values appreciably lower than those of ellipticals of similar luminosity .",
    "the same similarity also exists between the mg@xmath23 relations of bulges and ellipticals ( jablonka et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "as well known , the mg@xmath0 index depends on both age and metallicity ; actually on both the age and metallicity _ distributions_. therefore , the close similarity of the mg@xmath22 relations argues for spiral bulges and ellipticals sharing a similar star formation history and chemical enrichment .",
    "one may argue that origin and evolution have been very different , but differences in age distribution are precisely compensated by differences in the metallicity distributions",
    ". this may be difficult to disprove , and i tend to reject this alternative on aesthetic grounds .",
    "it requires an unattractive cosmic conspiracy , and i would rather leave to others the burden of defending such a scenario .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears legitimate to look at bulges as ellipticals that happen to have a prominent disk around them , or to ellipticals as bulges that for some reason have missed the opportunity to acquire or maintain a prominent disk .",
    "therefore , we can legitimately refer to _ spheroids _ as the class of objects that includes ellipticals and the bulge+halo component of spirals . in this mood ,",
    "the problem of the origin of bulges becomes the problem of the origin of spheroids .",
    "great progress has been made in recent years towards charting and modeling galaxy formation and evolution . yet",
    ", the origin of the galaxy morphologies , as illustrated by the hubble sequence , has so far defied a generally accepted explanation .",
    "this is also the case for spheroids , i.e. bulges and ellipticals alike , with two quite different scenarios still confronting each other . in one scenario spheroids",
    "come from the destruction of pre - existing disks or part of them . in the case of ellipticals , by merging spirals , a widely entertained notion since the original proposal by toomre ( 1977 ) . in the case of bulges , by some bar instability randomizing the orbits of stars originally in the inner part of a disk ( e.g. combes et al .",
    "1990 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; hasan , pfenninger , & norman 1993 ) , or by being merger remnant ellipticals that managed to re - acquire a new disk .",
    "this latter scenario is now motivated by hierarchical clustering cosmologies , and ellipticals are modeled to form through a series of merging events ( between spirals ) taking place over a major fraction of the cosmological time ( e.g. baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 ; kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "the other scenario assumes instead the whole baryonic mass of the galaxy being already assembled at early times in gaseous form , and for this reason it is sometimes qualified as _",
    "monolithic_. the original idea can be traced back to the milky way collapse model of eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage ( 1962 ) , with early examples including the models of larson ( 1974 ) and arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) . in this case , the disk of spirals is a late comer , somehow acquired later by a more ancient spheroid .    through the 1980 s much of the debate focused on the age of ellipticals as derived from the integrated spectrum of their stellar populations . in general , advocates of the merger model favored an intermediate age for the bulk of stars in ellipticals , but the matter remained controversial given the well know age - metallicity degeneracy and the crudeness of stellar population models of the time ( for opposite views see oconnell 1986 , and renzini 1986 ) .",
    "a first breakthrough came from noting the tightness of the color-@xmath24 relation of ellipticals in the virgo and coma clusters ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) .",
    "this demands a high degree of _ synchronicity _ in the star formation history of ellipticals , that is most naturally accounted for by pushing back to early times most of the star formation . making minimal use of stellar population models , this approach provided for the first time a _ robust _ demostration that at least _",
    "ellipticals are made of very old stars , with the bulk of them having formed at @xmath25 .",
    "the main lines of the bower et al .",
    "argument are as follows",
    ". the observed color scatter of cluster ellipticals is related to the age dispersion among them by the relation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the age of the `` oldest '' and `` youngest '' galaxies , respectively . here by age one intends the luminosity - weighted age of the stellar populations that constitute such galaxies .",
    "the time derivative of the color is obtained from evolutionary population synthesis models , which give @xmath29 mag / gyr for @xmath30 .",
    "the observed color scatter is @xmath31 mag , consistent with pure observational errors .",
    "hence , one gets @xmath32 gyr , and if the oldest galaxies are 15 gyr old , the youngest ones ought to be older than 13 gyr , from which bower et al .",
    "conclude they had to form at @xmath25 .",
    "if the oldest galaxies were instead as young as , say 5 gyr , then the youngest should be older than at least 3 gyr , which would require a high degree of synchronicity in their formation , which seems unlikely .",
    "evidence in support of the bower et al .",
    "conclusion has greatly expanded through the 1990 s , and is now compelling .",
    "this came from the tightness of the fundamental plane relation for ellipticals in local clusters ( renzini & ciotti 1993 ) , from the tightness of the color - magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters up to @xmath33 ( e.g. , aragon - salamanca et al . 1993 ; taylor et al .",
    "1998 ; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) , and from the modest shift with increasing redshift in the zero - point of the fundamental plane , mg@xmath34 , and color - magnitude relations of cluster ellipticals ( e.g. , bender et al .",
    "1997 ; dickinson 1995 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ; pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ; kodama et al . 1998 ) .",
    "all these studies agree in concluding that most stars in ellipticals formed at @xmath35 , though the precise value depends on the adopted cosmology .",
    "5 illustrates the case of the mg@xmath34 relation for ellipticals in two clusters at @xmath36 , while fig .",
    "6 documents the constancy of the color disperion of cluster ellipticals all the way to @xmath33 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that all these studies follow the methodological approach pioneered by bower et al .",
    "they focus indeed on the tightness of some correlation amomg the global properties of cluster ellipticals , which sets a robust constraint on their age dispersion as opposed to an attempt to date individual galaxies .",
    "moreover , the move to high redshift offers two fundamental advantages .",
    "the first advantage is that looking at high @xmath37 provides the best possible way ( i should say _ the _ way ) of removing the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "if spheroids are made of intermediate - age , metal rich stars , they should become rapidly bluer and then disappear already at moderate redshift ( e.g. kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "the observational opportunity of studing galaxies at large lookback times makes quite obsolete attempts at finding combinations of spectral indeces that may distinguish between age and metallicity effects in nearby galaxies .",
    "the second advantage is that at high redshift one gains more _ leverage _ : for given dispersion in some observable one can set tighter and tighter limits to the age dispersion .",
    "this comes from the color time derivatives being larger the younger the population .",
    "for example , the derivative @xmath38 is @xmath39 times larger at @xmath40 gyr than it is at @xmath41 gyr ( e.g. maraston 1998 ) , and therefore a given dispersion in this rest - frame color translates into a @xmath39 times tighter constraint on age and therefore on formation redshift .",
    "this is further illustrated also by the case of isolated high redshift ellipticals .",
    "for example , spinrad et al . (",
    "1997 ) found a _",
    "( i.e. passively evolving ) elliptical at @xmath42 for which they infer an age of at least 3.5 gyr , hence a formation redshift in excess of @xmath43 .",
    "an even much higher formation redshift may be appropriate for the extremely red galaxy in the nicmos field of the hdf - south , which spectral energy distribution is best accounted for by an old , passively evolving population at @xmath44 ( stiavelli et al .",
    "much of the evidence discussed in the previous section is restricted to cluster ellipticals . in hierarchical models ,",
    "clusters form out of the highest peaks in the primordial density fluctuations , and cluster ellipticals completing most of their star formation at high redshifts could be accommodated in the model ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998a ) . however , in lower density , _ field _ environments , both star formation and merging are appreciably delayed to later times ( kauffmann 1996 ) , which offers the opportunity for an observational test of the hierarchical merger paradigm .",
    "the notion of field ellipticals being a less homogeneous family compared to their cluster counterparts has been widely entertained , though the direct evidence has been only rarely discussed .",
    "visvanathan & sandage ( 1977 ) found cluster and field ellipticals to follow the same color - magnitude relation , but larson , tinsley , & caldwell ( 1980 )  using the same database  concluded that the scatter about the mean relation is larger in the field than in clusters .",
    "more recently , a larger scatter in field versus cluster ellipticals was also found for the fundamental plane relations by de carvalho & djorgovski ( 1992 ) .",
    "however , at least part of the larger scatter among field ellipticals certainly comes from their distances being more uncertain than for clusters .    taking advantage of a large sample ( @xmath45 ) of early - type galaxies with homogenously determined mg@xmath0 index and central velocity dispersion , bernardi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have recently compared the mg@xmath23 relations ( which are distance independent ! ) of cluster and field galaxies , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "8 . as it is evident from the figure , field , group , and cluster ellipticals",
    "all follow basically the same relation .",
    "the zero - point offset between cluster and field galaxies is @xmath46 mag , with field galaxies having lower values of 2 , a statistically significant , yet very small difference .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the offset of @xmath47 mag , obtained by jorgensen ( 1997 ) using 100 field and 143 cluster galaxies .    using the time derivative of the mg@xmath0 index from synthetic stellar populations , bernardi et al .",
    "conclude that the age difference between the stellar populations of cluster and field early - type galaxies is at most @xmath12 gyr .",
    "the actual difference in the mass - weighted age ( as opposed to the luminosity - weighted age ) could be significantly smaller that this .",
    "it suffices that a few galaxies have undergone a minor star formation event some gyr ago , with this having taken place preferentially among field galaxies .",
    "the comparison between these empirical findings and the theoretical simulations is somehow complicated by the rather loose way in which cluster , group , and field environment are defined in the observational studies on the one hand , and in the theoretical simulations on the other .",
    "for example , in the models of kauffmann ( 1996 ) there is a @xmath48 gyr age difference between model ellipticals now residing in a @xmath49 dark matter halo and those residing in a @xmath50 halo .",
    "this age difference would correspond to a difference @xmath512@xmath52 mag , which bernardi et al .",
    "data exclude at the @xmath53 level .",
    "however , in kauffmann & charlot ( 1998a ) cluster and field are defined as those dark matter halos with circular velocity @xmath54 km s@xmath55 and @xmath56 km s@xmath55 , respectively , and the age difference between model ellipticals in such two environments is greatly reduced . empirically , bernardi et al .",
    "have assigned to the field those galaxies that do not belong to known clusters or groups , and one does not know what the average circular velocity is in such environments . clearly , the problem is to find a common language between observers and model makers , i.e. a common way of defining cluster and field environments before comparing to each other data and simulations .",
    "as documented in the previous sections , compelling evidence now exists for the bulk of stars in galactic spheroids being very old , i.e. formed at redshifts beyond @xmath3 , and possibly even much beyond this value .",
    "this applies to ellipticals and bulges alike , in clusters as well as in the lower desity regions still inhabited by spheroids , including the bulge of our own galaxy .",
    "this is what was expected ( actually postulated ) in the monolithic collapse scenario , while it appears to be quite at variance with most realizations of the hierarchical merging scenario .",
    "the fact that spheroids are made of old stars does not necessarily invalidate the hierarchical merging paradigm , which actually offers a still unique description on how large galaxies could have been assembled .",
    "one possibility to comply with with the observations may be to tune hierarchical models to mimic the monolithic model , by pushing most of the action back to an earlier cosmological epoch . with most of the merging taking place at high redshifts , among still mostly gaseous components , merging itself",
    "would promotes widespread starburst activity .",
    "the natural observational counterparts of these events may be represented by the lyman - break galaxies at @xmath17 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) , where star formation rates could be as high as @xmath57 ( dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "it remains to be explored whether such tuning of algorithms and parameters of the hierarchical model could produce model universes fulfilling all other observational constraints .",
    "alternatively , stars now in spheroids do indeed form at very high redshifts , but they are assembled into big spheroids only at much later times ( as favored , e.g. by kauffman 1996 ) .",
    "one testable prediction of the hierarchical merging model is that  obviously  bigger galaxies form later by assembling smaller pieces , and their stellar populations are appreciably younger than those of smaller galaxies .",
    "therefore , intrinsically brighter galaxies should get bluer at a faster rate with increasing @xmath37 , compared to fainter ones . as a consequence , the color - magnitude , color-@xmath24 , mg-@xmath24 and fundamental plane relations should _ flatten _ with increasing redshift ( lookback time ) .",
    "no such effect has been detected yet : the slope of the color - magnitude relation appears to be the same all the way to at least @xmath58 ( see bottom panel in fig .",
    "the predicted flattening is actually a consequence of the postulate that ellipticals are made by merging spirals , with the gas in the disks being turned into stars when the two dark matter halos merge .",
    "hence , in this frame late merging implies late star formation as well . on the other hand",
    ", it remains to be seen whether dissipationless merging of gas - free galaxies can produce the spheroids we see at low redshift , with their very high phase - space density .",
    "if so , the color - mag and similar relations should actually get _ steeper _ with increasing redshift .",
    "the other prediction of the hierarchical model is that big galaxies should progressively disappear with increasing redshift , and several claims have been made pros and cons the actual disappearence of elliptical in various redshift surveys .",
    "unfortunately , this approach is less conclusive than it may appear at first sight : when ellipticals are selected following either color or morphological criteria a small residual star formation should suffice to let otherwise old galaxies to drop out of the selected samples , even if their main ( spheroidal ) body is already in place .    to overcome the intrinsic weakness of this approach , kauffmann & charlot ( 1998b )",
    "avoid using either color or morphology criteria , and adopt a pure @xmath59band magnitude limited selection criterion . in this way the number evolution of massive galaxies is followed , independently of morphology or trace star formation , hence providing a more fundamental test of the models . comparing to a @xmath60 sample of galaxies with measured redshift",
    ", they conclude that their pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) models are excluded by a large margin .",
    "such models would predict @xmath61 of the galaxies in the sample to be at @xmath62 , while only @xmath7 is observed , hence they argue for number evolution due to merging being at work .",
    "the same test can be attempted on the somewhat bigger @xmath59band magnitude limited sample of cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which includes 195 objects down to @xmath63 . among these objects ,",
    "24 turned out to be stars and for 34 objects no redshift could be determined . among the residual 137 objects ,",
    "21 have @xmath62 .",
    "the vast majority of objects without a measured redshift are likely to be galaxies at @xmath62 , whose strong spectral features have moved out of the range of the optical spectrograph .",
    "if so , the sample would have @xmath64 out @xmath65 galaxies at @xmath62 , or @xmath66 .",
    "interpolating on figure 4 in kauffmann & charlot ( 1998b ) one can roughly estimate that their ple model predicts @xmath67 of galaxies in a @xmath68 sample to be at @xmath62 , while their hierarchical model predicts @xmath7 .",
    "so , the cohen et al .",
    "sample suggests a value that is just midway between the predictions of the two models .",
    "clearly , existing samples are still too small for reaching any firm conclusion , especially when considering that large fluctuations may take place between one pencil beam survey and another due to fluctuations in the sampled large scale structures . for example , cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) emphasize that approximately half of the galaxies in their sample lie in five `` redshift peaks '' , likely due to clustering .",
    "therefore , poisson statistics may be more profitably applied to the number of sampled `` structures '' , rather than to that of galaxies .      with spheroids containing at least 30% of all stars in the local universe ( schechter & dressler 1987 ; persic & salucci 1992 ) or even more ( fukujita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) , one can conclude that at least 30% of all stars  hence @xmath69 of metals  have formed at @xmath17 ( renzini 1998a ; dressler & gunn 1990 ) .",
    "this is several times more than suggested by a conservative interpretation of the early attempt at tracing the cosmic history of star formation , either empirically ( madau et al . 1996 ) or with theoretical simulations ( e.g. baugh et al . 1996 ) .",
    "yet , it is in fine agreement with the recent direct estimates from the spectroscopy of lyman - break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) , as well as with sub - mm observations ( hughes et al . 1998 ) , where the cosmic sfr runs flat for @xmath70 , as in one of the options offered by the models of madau , pozzetti , & dickinson ( 1998 ) .",
    "[ [ the - role - of - spheroids - in - the - metal - enrichment - of - the - early - universe ] ] the role of spheroids in the metal enrichment of the early universe ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the global metallicity of the present day universe is best estimated in clusters of galaxies , where it is @xmath71 solar .",
    "this can be taken as representative of the overall metallicity since clusters and _ field _ have converted into star and galaxies nearly the same fraction of baryons ( renzini 1997 ) .",
    "with @xmath69 of all stars having formed at @xmath17 , and the metallicity of the @xmath72 universe being @xmath71 solar , it is straightforward to conclude that the global metallicity of the @xmath73 universe had to be at least @xmath74 ( renzini 1998a , c ) .",
    "damped ly@xmath75 systems ( dla ) may offer an opportunity to check this prediction , though they may provide a vision of the early universe that is biased in favor of cold , metal - poor gas that has been only marginally affected by star formation and metal pollution .",
    "metal rich objects that may exist at high redshift , such as giant starbursts that would be dust obscured , metal rich passively evolving spheroids , and the hot icm / igm obviously do not enlist among dlas .",
    "still , these objects may contain much of the metals in the @xmath76 universe as they do in the present day universe . in spite of these limitations",
    "the average metallicity of the dlas at @xmath73 appears to be @xmath77 solar ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 , see their fig .",
    "4 ) , just a factor of 2 below the expected value from the _ fossil evidence_. however , this is still much higher than the extreme lower limit @xmath78 at @xmath73 as inferred from ly@xmath75 forest observations ( songaila 1997 ) . ly@xmath75",
    "forest material is believed to contain a major fraction of cosmic baryons at high @xmath37 , hence ( perhaps ) of metals .",
    "there is therefore a potential conflict with the estimated global metallicity at @xmath79 , and the notion of ly@xmath75 forest metallicity being representative of the the universe metallicity at this redshift . scaling down from the cluster yield ,",
    "such low metallicity was achieved when only @xmath80 of stars had formed , which may be largely insufficient to ionize the universe and keep it ionized up to this redshift ( madau 1998 , but see gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "this suggests that ly@xmath75 forest may not trace the mass - averaged metallicity of high redshift universe , and that the universe was very inhomogeneous at that epoch .",
    "the bulk of metals would be partly locked into stars in the young spheroidals , partly would reside in a yet undetected hot igm , a phase hotter than the ly@xmath75 forest phase .",
    "several questions remain open at this stage .",
    "some of them can soon get answers from observations , others from new theoretical simulations , or from extracting more information from old ones . of course , the list of interesting questions could actually be much longer , and include e.g. the origin(s ) of all those structural and morphological aspects that have been set deliberately aside in this review .        of galaxy formation ?",
    "how much number evolution of spheroids has taken place between @xmath81 and @xmath72 ? what is the redshift distribution of a fair and complete sample of @xmath68 galaxies ? is the fraction of spheroids formed by merging",
    "_ spirals _ very large or very small ? at which redshift do color - magnitude ( and analogous ) relations for ellipticals begin to      clusters , and if so by how much ?",
    "are lyman - break galaxies spheroids in formation ?",
    "what is their mass ?",
    "what is the global metallicity of the universe at @xmath73 ? does an early assembly of bulges help forming the right disks ? is the early universe re - ionized and maintained ionized by forming spheroids ?",
