    "overall , in the current problem , the static approximation by itself is not a serious limitation .      a single field decomposition that is static can not in general capture instabilities in all channels .",
    "in the fflo regime the pairing , density , and magnetic channels are in principle all relevant .",
    "however , we find that for our chosen mean density , the density modulations in the fflo phase are very weak so ` density channel ' effects are not important ( they would be very important if @xmath190 ) .",
    "the presence of an additional magnetic channel may make a quantitative difference to our results .",
    "while these additional channels are readily incorporated within mft a non gaussian fluctuation theory , like ours , involving all these modes is difficult to construct .",
    "we have opted to stay with a simple decomposition so that the fluctuation theory can be better handled .    for the homogeneous bp phase we have found that there is no density wave ordering tendency at @xmath191 and the field regime that we have considered .",
    "_ fluctuations _ in density are present , as evidenced in figs.7 and 9 , but are small since the field induced magnetization suppresses the density wave susceptibility . in a more elaborate calculation the fluctuations could be numerically larger , without changing the qualitative features of our result .      the mc implementation using the bogoliubov - de gennes scheme",
    "requires repeated diagonalisation of the fermion problem . done exactly this computation scales as @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the system size , limiting one to @xmath194 , hardly adequate to access complex phases .",
    "this is a primary limitation in fflo studies and limits most finite temperature studies to mean field theory .",
    "we can access much larger size ( up to @xmath195 , say ) since we use a cluster based update scheme , discussed in the text .",
    "unfortunately the cluster size introduces another length scale , that affects access to fflo phases , but does not seem to have much impact on the uniform sc state .",

    "it shows up in the mc results as well , with @xmath0 scales suppressed due to amplitude and phase fluctuations .",

    "it thus includes classical fluctuations of arbitrary magnitude but no quantum ( @xmath272 ) fluctuations .",
    "one may consider different temperature regimes : ( 1 )  @xmath34 : since classical fluctuations die off at @xmath34 , saf reduces to standard bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) mft .",
