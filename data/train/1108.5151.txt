    "geometry and the quantum mechanics of particles have an uneasy relationship which is why general relativity is hard to incorporate into quantum field theory .",
    "string theory is an ambitious and remarkable attempt at unification with many successes but the final theory has proved mysterious and elusive .",
    "einstein and bohr fought a long battle on this front and bohr was generally deemed to have won , with the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics accepted . but einstein s belief in the role of geometry made a partial come - back with the adoption of gauge theories as models of particle physics .",
    "a more modest and limited role for geometry in nuclear physics was proposed by skyrme @xcite with the solitonic model of baryons , i.e. proton , neutron and nuclei , now known as skyrmions .",
    "these have been shown to be approximate models of the physical baryons occurring in gauge theories of quarks and gluons , and have been extensively studied @xcite with considerable success .    in this paper",
    "we explore a geometric model of particles which is inspired by skyrme s idea but with potential applications to both baryonic and leptonic particle physics .",
    "our model differs from the skyrme model in that it uses riemannian geometry rather than field theory , and so it is closer in spirit to einstein s ideas .",
    "another key difference is that we absorb the kaluza - klein idea of an extra circle dimension to incorporate electromagnetism .",
    "however , we exchange the roles of electricity and magnetism relative to the standard kaluza - klein approach , so that the extra circle dimension is magnetic rather than electric , and it is the electric charge that is topologically quantised by the famous dirac argument . we will also , initially , ignore time and dynamics , focusing on purely static models .",
    "our geometric models will therefore be 4-dimensional riemannian manifolds .",
    "we require the manifolds to be oriented and complete but not usually compact : we use non - compact manifolds to model electrically charged particles , and compact manifolds for neutral particles .",
    "both baryon number and electric charge will be encoded in the topology , with baryon number ( at least provisionally ) identified with the signature of the 4-manifold . ] and electric charge with minus the chern class of an asymptotic fibration by circles . in particular",
    ", the number of protons and the number of neutrons will therefore be determined topologically .",
    "the manifolds will also have an ` asymptotic ' structure which captures their relation to physical 3-space .",
    "the non - compact manifolds we consider have an asymptotic region which is fibred over physical 3-space , so no additional structure is required . for the compact ( neutral ) models ,",
    "however , we fix a distinguished embedded surface @xmath2 where the 4-manifold @xmath3 intersects physical 3-space .",
    "we also call @xmath4 the inside of @xmath3 .    for single particles , the symmetry group of rotations should fix all of the above data",
    ". it should act isometrically on the 4-manifold and preserve the asymptotic structure . in the non - compact cases",
    "this means that it should be a bundle map in the asymptotic region , covering the usual @xmath5-action on physical 3-space . in the compact cases",
    "it should preserve the distinguished surface @xmath2 . in order to capture the fermionic nature of the particles considered in this paper we also require spin structures on the non - compact manifolds and on the inside ( in the sense defined above ) of compact manifolds .",
    "moreover , the lift of the rotation group action to the spin bundle ( over the entire manifold in the non - compact case and over the inside in the compact case ) should necessarily be an @xmath6-action , and this is what we mean by saying that our models are fermionic .",
    "a key restriction on ( the conformal classes of ) our manifolds is that they are self - dual .",
    "recall that the riemann curvature is made up of the ricci tensor plus the weyl tensor @xmath7 , which is conformally invariant . in dimension 4",
    ", @xmath7 is the sum of self - dual and anti - self - dual parts w = w^+ w^- .",
    "a 4-manifold @xmath3 is said to be self - dual if @xmath8 .",
    "these manifolds are precisely those which have twistor spaces in the sense of penrose @xcite .",
    "the latter are 3-dimensional complex manifolds @xmath9 with a real @xmath10-fibration over @xmath3 .",
    "the complex structure of @xmath9 ( together with a real involution which is the antipodal map on each @xmath10 ) encodes the entire conformal structure of @xmath3 .",
    "even the einstein metric can be captured by complex data on @xmath9 .",
    "a simply - connected self - dual 4-manifold , for which the ricci tensor is also zero , is a hyperkhler manifold , whose structure group reduces to @xmath6 .",
    "it is a complex khler manifold for an @xmath10-family of complex structures , but for any of these complex structures , and for the complex orientation , it would be anti - self - dual . since we want self - dual manifolds we choose the opposite orientation .",
    "while some of our particles , including the proton , will be modelled by hyperkhler manifolds , we do not want to be so restrictive .",
    "instead we will only require our 4-manifold models of particles to be self - dual and einstein , so there can be a non - zero scalar curvature .",
    "our model for the neutron is of this type , distinguishing it from the proton .",
    "the neutron will of course also have electric charge zero .",
    "we should point out that reversing the orientation of a 4-manifold turns a self - dual manifold into an anti - self - dual one .",
    "this should be interpreted as giving the geometric model of an anti - particle .",
    "the existence of anti - particles follows from @xmath11 invariance , and our models are compatible with this .",
    "self - dual 4-manifolds are , in many ways , the 4-dimensional analogue of riemann surfaces , with @xmath12 replacing @xmath13 in homology .",
    "in particular there are theorems @xcite which assert that such manifolds admit connected sums although , unlike in the case of riemann surfaces , there are restrictions on when this is possible .",
    "such connected sums model composite objects , like nuclei .",
    "although we focus at present on static particles we do envisage a deformation theory , using the moduli space of self - dual manifolds , which could underlie particle interactions .    fortunately a lot is now known about self - dual 4-manifolds with many metrics explicitly calculated .",
    "this makes it possible to put forward some definite models for the proton and neutron .",
    "even though our ideas are inspired by skyrme s theory of baryons , it turns out that geometric models of leptons , i.e. the electron and ( electron-)neutrino , are even simpler , and we shall describe them too in the class of self - dual manifolds .",
    "thus , somewhat surprisingly , our framework of self - dual manifolds allows us to describe baryons and leptons in a unified fashion .    the language and spirit of our model for particles is close to that of general relativity and suggests the possibility of a unification with gravity , but we do not address this issue here . in particular , we do not specify an action functional .",
    "instead , we focus on how our model describes general features of particles such as their various quantum numbers .",
    "we are aware that a description of elementary particles as 4-dimensional riemannian manifolds is radically different from established treatments in terms of quantum field theory .",
    "what we aim to show in this paper is that such a geometric approach is possible , and that it has some surprising and attractive features , such as the possibility of describing the electron and the proton in one framework . while we do propose definite identifications of certain 4-manifolds with specific particles in sects .",
    "3 - 5 of this paper , these should be seen as illustrations of the geometric approach , not necessarily as final proposals .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .  2 we outline the genesis of our geometric models of particles , starting with the skyrme model of baryons .",
    "electrically charged particles are necessarily described by non - compact 4-manifolds in our approach , and in sect .",
    "3 we explain how to model the electron and proton in terms of the taub - nut and atiyah - hitchin manifolds , respectively .",
    "neutral particles are described by compact 4-manifolds , and this is discussed in sects .",
    "we propose @xmath0 as a model for the neutron and @xmath1 as a model for the neutrino .",
    "these are the simplest choices , but we also discuss some more sophisticated versions . in sect .",
    "6 we describe how our particle models glue into empty space , and how the particles may interact with each other .",
    "7 contains an outline of how our geometric models capture the spinorial nature of the particles they describe . in sect .",
    "8 we give the dictionary which translates topological properties of 4-manifolds into the electric charge and baryon number of particles , and discuss in some detail how these charges are related to fields and densities used in conventional lagrangian models of particle physics .",
    "9 contains our conclusion and some ideas for follow - up work .",
    "conventions and calculations are collected in appendices a , b and c.",
    "we begin by spelling out in detail how the skyrme model suggests our 4-manifold model .",
    "the skyrme model is based on a group - valued field from @xmath14 , [ skyrmefield ] u : ^3 g , where the lie group @xmath15 is usually taken to be @xmath6 , and @xmath16 as @xmath17 . the degree of @xmath18 as a map @xmath19 is identified with baryon number .",
    "the minima of the skyrme energy , for each baryon number , are called skyrmions .",
    "skyrmions are free to rotate , both in physical space and through conjugation by elements of @xmath6 .",
    "quantising this motion gives the skyrmions spin and electric charge .",
    "the proton and neutron , for example , are distinct quantum states of the essentially unique skyrmion of degree 1 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown how to generate such skyrme fields naturally by starting with an @xmath6 yang - mills gauge field on @xmath20 and calculating the holonomy along the 4th direction .",
    "suitable asymptotic behaviour on @xmath20 guarantees a well - defined map @xmath18 .",
    "although this construction does not preserve the respective energy functionals it does provide a good way of using instantons on @xmath20 ( i.e. self - dual gauge fields ) to construct approximate minima of the skyrme energy .",
    "it also identifies instanton number with the skyrme degree .",
    "see also the recent papers @xcite where the difference between the yang - mills and skyrme energy functionals is interpreted as due to an infinite tower of mesons .",
    "since the yang - mills energy functional in dimension 4 is conformally invariant we could replace the decomposition",
    "^4 = ^3 ^1 by s^4 s^2 = h^3 s^1 , where @xmath21 is hyperbolic 3-space .",
    "in fact we can vary the curvature of @xmath21 provided we rescale the circle @xmath22 the opposite way , so that large circles correspond to almost flat @xmath21 .",
    "we can now fix a gauge field on @xmath23 and take the holonomy round the circles .",
    "there are some technicalities ( due to base - points ) which we shall ignore but basically we expect to end up with a skyrmion on @xmath21 , an idea which has been explored in @xcite",
    ".    now replace @xmath24 by any riemannian 4-manifold @xmath3 which is asymptotically fibred by circles over @xmath14 .",
    "this is the kind of kaluza - klein 4-manifold we are going to consider .",
    "an @xmath6 gauge field on @xmath3 would then give a skyrme field on ` the quotient of @xmath3 by @xmath22 ' .",
    "since we do not want to assume there is a global circle fibration , this skyrme field will only be defined asymptotically outside some ` core ' . but an oriented 4-manifold has two natural @xmath6 bundles over it , the two spin bundles @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( assuming @xmath3 is a spin - manifold , i.e. @xmath27 ) . picking one of these , say @xmath25 , we then get from the connection on @xmath25 a natural construction of an asymptotic skyrme field on @xmath14 .",
    "this is roughly the genesis of our idea to model particles by 4-manifolds , but the topology of these asymptotic skyrme fields does not quite fit , and would not give integer baryon numbers as defined in our model .",
    "the reason lies in a fundamental difference between the topology of gauge bundles which can have arbitrary instanton number ( or second chern class ) and the topology of tangent bundles , where there are divisibility theorems .",
    "for example the first pontrjagin class of a 4-manifold ( compact and oriented ) is divisible by 3 and then gives the signature .",
    "an example is @xmath0 which has signature 1 and pontrjagin class 3 ( times the generator of @xmath28 ) .    in the skyrme model",
    "the basic idea is that baryon number is identified with the degree of the map @xmath18 in , or equivalently with the instanton number ( or second chern class ) of the @xmath6 bundle over @xmath20 .",
    "this differs from the 4-manifold model we want to explore , where baryon number is identified with the signature of the 4-manifold .",
    "the signature is additive under taking connected sums of 4-manifolds @xcite , and this captures the additivity of baryon number for composites of particles , for example , fusion of nuclei .",
    "the integrality of the signature is linked to it being an index of an elliptic operator .",
    "this means we are in the realm of k - theory rather than cohomology .",
    "a consequence of this change of viewpoint is that the geometry of the 4-manifold model is important for us , but we will not try to define a global 3-dimensional skyrme field @xmath18",
    ".    recall that in the skyrme model , baryon number is cohomological and electric charge arises at the quantum level . for our 4-manifold model ,",
    "electric charge is cohomological , arising , as already explained , from the first chern class of the asymptotic @xmath22-fibration , while baryon number as just indicated should be seen as an index .    to sum up our discussion , we see that our model goes beyond the skyrme model in aiming to understand topologically both the basic integer physical invariants , baryon number and electric charge .",
    "the two models are different , but possibly dual in a suitable sense .",
    "we hope to explore this in detail at a later stage .",
    "models for the basic particles should exhibit a high degree of symmetry and we expect the rotation group @xmath5 of @xmath14 , or its double cover @xmath6 , to act as isometries . for electrically charged particles , we take our geometric models to be non - compact hyperkhler manifolds . we also assume that the volume grows with the third power of the radius , to allow for an interpretation of the asymptotic region in terms of physical 3-space .",
    "as recently shown in @xcite , this forces the hyperkhler manifold to be alf .",
    "we are therefore looking for rotationally symmetric and complete alf hyperkhler manifolds .",
    "there are just two possibilities :    1 .   the taub - nut manifold @xcite depending on a positive parameter @xmath29 ( interpreted as mass in the gravitational context ) . for brevity",
    "we denote it by tn .",
    "the atiyah - hitchin manifold , the ( simply - connected double cover of the ) moduli space of centred @xmath6-monopoles of charge two @xcite . for brevity we denote it by ah .",
    "note that we could also single out tn and ah among non - compact , complete and rotationally symmetric hyperkhler manifolds by demanding that the @xmath6- ( or @xmath5- ) action rotates the complex structures , see our discussion following .",
    "this turns out to play a role in recovering the usual rotation action on physical 3-space in the asymptotic region of our geometric models , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ spinsect ] .    both tn and ah can be parametrised in terms of a radial coordinate @xmath30 and angular coordinates on @xmath6 ( for tn ) or @xmath31 ( for ah ) .",
    "details are given in appendix  [ ahtndetails ] . in terms of the left - invariant 1-forms defined in ,",
    "the metrics of both tn and ah can be written as @xmath32 with the functions @xmath33 satisfying the self - duality equations [ dual ] = ( b - c)^2 -a^2 , , where @xmath34 means we add the two further equations obtained by cyclic permutation of @xmath35 .",
    "we adopt the convention f(r)=- , where ( for reasons that will emerge later ) the radial coordinate @xmath30 has the range @xmath36 for tn and @xmath37 for ah .",
    "the self - duality equations become @xmath38    this system has solutions in terms of elementary functions [ tncoef ] a(r)=b(r ) = r c= , with parameters @xmath39 , associated to the tn manifold .",
    "the topology is that of @xmath20 , and as @xmath40 the metric tends to the flat metric . for @xmath41",
    "the manifold is asymptotic to an @xmath22 fibre - bundle over @xmath14 with the length of the circle being @xmath42 .",
    "there is a @xmath43 symmetry acting along the fibres , with just one fixed point at the origin , @xmath44 .",
    "the whole isometry group is @xmath45 .",
    "as @xmath40 the @xmath43-action becomes the scalar action on @xmath46 .",
    "the complex orientation of @xmath46 determines the orientation of tn as a self - dual manifold ; this is opposite to the orientation given by any of the complex structures in the hyperkhler family , see appendix  [ signstnah ] for a discussion . at infinity ,",
    "the @xmath43-action gives the standard hopf line bundle over @xmath47 with chern class @xmath48 ; details are given in appendix  [ conventions ] .",
    "the tn metric with coefficient functions has the following behaviour under scaling by non - vanishing real numbers @xmath49 : r r , mm , ^2 , ds^2 ^2 ds^2 .",
    "we use rescaling by @xmath50 to set @xmath51 , and rescaling by @xmath52 to set @xmath53 from now on .",
    "this amounts to picking a unit of length for the radial coordinate @xmath30 and to fixing an overall scale for the metric .",
    "our choice is motivated by the asymptotic form of the ah metric , to be discussed below .",
    "note that , with this choice , the length of the asymptotic circle , in the length units chosen , is @xmath54 .",
    "the solution which gives rise to ah has the _ asymptotic _ form , for large @xmath30 , [ ahcoef ] a(r ) ~b(r ) ~r c(r ) ~- .",
    "these asymptotic expressions , a tn metric with @xmath55 , also satisfy .",
    "however @xmath56 is not actually equal to @xmath57 , and @xmath30 only extends down to @xmath58 . for @xmath30 near @xmath58 ,",
    "is a poor approximation .",
    "instead , one finds the leading terms [ ahsmallr ] a(r ) ~2(r- ) , b(r ) ~+ 1 2 ( r- ) , c(r ) ~-+1 2 ( r- ) , which we will need later in this paper .",
    "the manifold ah is the complement of @xmath59 ( the real projective plane ) embedded in @xmath0 , and the complex orientation of @xmath0 determines the orientation of ah as a self - dual manifold . as for tn",
    "this is opposite to the orientation given by any of the complex structures in the hyperkhler family ; see our discussion in appendix  [ signstnah ] .",
    "ah has an @xmath5 symmetry with just one 2-dimensional orbit at @xmath60 , which is a minimal 2-sphere .",
    "we refer to this minimal 2-sphere , which is the totally imaginary conic in @xmath0 and determined by @xmath61 in the homogeneous coordinates introduced in sect .",
    "[ cp2sect ] , as the core .",
    "asymptotically , the manifold is fibred by circles . as further discussed below ,",
    "neither the circles nor the base space of this asymptotic fibration are oriented because of a @xmath62-identification , given explicitly in .",
    "the manifold tn is usually interpreted as the geometry of a dirac monopole at the origin @xcite . for us , with electric and magnetic charges reversed , it has to be interpreted as an electrically charged particle .",
    "since the signature of tn is zero ( we discuss this further in sect .  [ enfluxsection ] ) the particle is leptonic .",
    "we therefore interpret tn as a model for the electron . down on @xmath14 , after factoring by @xmath43 , any 2-sphere surrounding the origin has an electric flux emerging from it due to the electron , which carries charge @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that there is a sign change in going from the chern class to the electric charge .",
    "the manifold ah has the opposite asymptotic behaviour with a sign change for @xmath29 and an orientation change ( see appendix  [ conventions ] ) and so would lead us naturally to expect electric charge + 1 . also , the topology at the core is different , with a 2-sphere instead of a point . as a result ,",
    "ah has signature 1 ( again discussed further in sect .",
    "[ enfluxsection ] ) and looks like the model we want for the proton ( rather than the positron ) .",
    "however things are not quite that simple , as we shall now explain .",
    "the ` asymptotic boundary ' of ah is not @xmath64 as for tn but the boundary of a tubular neighbourhood of @xmath59 in @xmath0 , which is @xmath64 divided by a cyclic group of order 4 .",
    "moreover the base of this unoriented circle fibration is @xmath59 , not @xmath10 , and is non - orientable .",
    "this means that the 3-manifold which is the base of the asymptotic fibration is not @xmath14 , and has a fundamental group of order 2 .",
    "it is not orientable .",
    "this might seem to be a disaster , but we shall argue that , while unexpected , it is not as bad as it looks . the most convincing argument in its favour is to show that the electric charge is well - defined and equal to + 1 as hoped .",
    "this is done in detail in appendix  [ conventions ] .",
    "the lack of orientability in physical 3-space should be thought of as follows .",
    "the lack of orientation in @xmath14 locally is compensated by a corresponding ambiguity in the sign of electric charge ( non - orientability of the circle fibres ) .",
    "physically the geometric orientation is not felt .",
    "having put forward a definite proposal for the proton we now have to face the neutron .",
    "since the neutron has no electric charge any non - compact model would need to have a trivial asymptotic circle fibration .",
    "the 4-manifold should have signature 1 and it should resemble the ah model of the proton in its @xmath5 orbit structure . however , the latter requirement rules out asymptotically trivial circle bundles over physical 3-space since the generic @xmath5 orbits would be 2-dimensional in that case .",
    "we therefore consider compact 4-manifolds .",
    "in fact , there is an obvious choice which is just the complex projective plane @xmath0 with its fubini - study metric ( and its natural complex orientation ) .",
    "this is a self - dual manifold of positive scalar curvature .",
    "@xmath0 has even more symmetry than we need , since it is acted on by @xmath65 .",
    "the rotation group @xmath5 sits inside as the subgroup that preserves the real structure given by complex conjugation .",
    "this preserves @xmath59 as in the case of the proton , so we fix this @xmath59 as the distinguished surface where the 4-manifold intersects physical 3-space , thus breaking the symmetry to @xmath5 . the global @xmath65 symmetry might give us a link to quarks , but this remains to be explored .",
    "the fubini - study metric is often written in coordinates which exhibit the invariance under @xmath66 .",
    "this brings out the parallels with tn @xcite but is not the symmetry we want in our neutron model . for the interpretation of @xmath0 as a neutron and for a comparison with the ah model of the proton",
    ", we need to write the fubini - study metric in coordinates adapted to the @xmath5-action , which is discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we write the results of @xcite in the conventions used in our discussion of the ah metric .    in terms of homogeneous coordinates @xmath67 ( with the identification @xmath68 , @xmath69 )",
    "the fubini - study metric on @xmath0 is ds^2 = . for calculations we can fix @xmath70 and parametrise [ ourchoice ] = e^i r _ 0 , where @xmath71 can , in turn , be parametrised in terms of euler angles as shown in appendix b.1 .",
    "the reference vector @xmath72 ( which depends on one parameter ) should be a unit vector and we can assume , by adjusting the phase @xmath50 if necessary , that its real and imaginary parts are orthogonal .",
    "for our purpose , it is convenient to single out the 1-axis and pick [ referencevec ] _ 0 =    0 + a_2 + i a_3    , a_2 ^ 2 + a_3 ^ 2=1",
    ". then we find the following expression for the fubini - study metric in terms of the left - invariant forms on @xmath5 ( for details of an analogous calculation we refer the reader to @xcite ) : [ cp2first ] ds^2 = d a_2 ^ 2 + da_3 ^ 2 + ( a_3 ^ 2-a_2 ^ 2)^2 _ 1 ^ 2 + a_3 ^",
    "2_2 ^ 2 + a_2 ^ 2 ^ 2_3 . parametrising [ anglepick ] a_2=(+ ) , a_3= ( + ) , , we obtain , finally , the fubini - study metric in the form [ cp2second ] ds^2 = 1 4 d ^2 + ^2_1 ^ 2 + ^2(+ ) _ 2 ^ 2 + ^2 ( + ) ^2_3 .    there is a simple interpretation of the geometry of @xmath0 and its orbit structure in terms of orientated ellipses up to scale @xcite , which is useful for comparison with the ah metric .",
    "as already exploited above , we can adjust the phase in the homogeneous coordinate @xmath73 ( no longer fixed to satisfy @xmath74 ) so that the real vectors @xmath75 and @xmath76 are orthogonal : if @xmath77 this is automatic , and if @xmath78 we multiply by a unit complex number to set im@xmath79 and re@xmath80 ( we pick the negative sign to agree with the choice made in above ) .",
    "we can interpret @xmath76 and @xmath75 as the major- and minor - axis of an ellipse .",
    "this ellipse is only determined up to scale ( we can still rescale @xmath81 by any positive real number ) but it is orientated .",

    "this is the same as the orbit structure of ah compactified by an @xmath59 at infinity , although the metric is of course different .",
    "we also note that the khler form = i takes the simple form [ cp2harmonic ] = _ 2_3- d_1 , which should be compared to the expression given in @xcite in coordinates adapted to the @xmath45 symmetry of @xmath0",
    ". the form @xmath91 is invariant under the 180@xmath89-rotation about the 1-axis and hence well - defined on the generic @xmath5-orbits .",
    "it is manifestly closed , but not exact : for @xmath92 we can write @xmath93 but this expression is not valid on the exceptional @xmath5-orbit where @xmath87 , since @xmath94 is not well - defined there .",
    "the khler form is self - dual with respect to the complex orientation ( with volume element @xmath95 ) . since it is closed , it is also harmonic .",
    "the existence of a non - exact harmonic , self - dual form on @xmath0 follows from the fact that the signature of @xmath0 is 1 . in view of our interpretation of signature as baryonic charge one might expect there to be a baryonic interpretation of @xmath91 .",

    ", we will in the next section discuss how our various models are supposed to fit into conventional 3-space .",
    "so far our models are abstract objects , 4-manifolds on their own , which are supposed to model four basic particles of nature . how are we to view them in the real world ?",
    "let us begin with the easiest case , that of the electron . thought of originally as the dirac monopole , the idea is well - known .",
    "we consider kaluza - klein space as a riemannian 4-manifold with a circle action .",
    "away from matter this space is assumed to be a circle bundle over @xmath14 . outside a given region in @xmath14 which is electrically neutral",
    "the bundle is assumed to be ( topologically ) just the product space .",
    "if a region is electrically charged the circle bundle over the boundary is supposed to have a chern class equal to minus the charge .",
    "if we start from the vacuum , then inserting one electron amounts to attaching a truncated version of tn to the boundary .",
    "this truncation turns the idealized model into a more realistic model of a particle .",
    "if other particles are present , tn will be an approximation to the precise metric .",
    "this approximation is some measure of the force exerted on the electron . in a dynamic theory",
    ", forces should emerge from the equations , a task for the future .",
    "next let us move on to the proton .",
    "this is similar , using a truncated version of ah .",
    "however , as pointed out earlier , the circle fibration is now not oriented so that the asymptotic 3-space is not @xmath14 ( unless our region contains equal numbers of protons and anti - protons ) .",
    "the model for the neutron is compact , so there is no way to attach it to a boundary .",
    "instead we propose that our model neutron ( a copy of @xmath0 ) intersects our 4-space in a surface .",
    "this surface should project to a surface in 3-space which is the ` boundary ' of the neutron as seen by an observer .",
    "since we want to keep the neutron similar to the proton ( except for the charge ) it seems reasonable to take this surface to be a copy of @xmath59 .",
    "but since the charge is now zero the circle bundle over the surface should be trivial . this could arise as follows .",
    "pick a point in @xmath14 and blow it up to give an @xmath59 , so that we are modifying 3-space in this neighbourhood .",
    "keep the circle bundle trivial , so making the charge zero .",
    "lift this @xmath59 into the total space of the circle bundle and let the @xmath0 neutron model intersect 4-space in this @xmath59 , which is the distinguished @xmath59 in @xmath0 ( hence breaking the larger symmetry of @xmath0 ) . in this construction the metric on @xmath0 need not be changed .",
    "the only change that is needed is the change in metric on the background 4-space got from the blowing up process in 3-space .",
    "finally we come to the neutrino . from the other examples it is clear what is required .",
    "this time we just take a 3-ball in @xmath14 with boundary a 2-sphere .",
    "the circle bundle over it is trivial and we lift the sphere to the total 4-space .",
    "we now require the @xmath1 neutrino model to intersect our 4-space in the chosen 2-sphere .",
    "the choice of the 2-sphere in @xmath1 again breaks the symmetry , down to @xmath118 .",
    "the 2-sphere need not be a great ( geodesic ) sphere and this provides a parameter to play with .",
    "note that in this case we could reinterpret the picture as the surgery that kills off the circle and leaves a 2-sphere .",
    "this means that for the electron , the proton and the neutrino we can still think of our ` space ' as a 4-manifold .",
    "but this does not seem to work for the neutron where we have to settle for a 4-space with intersecting components like a complex algebraic surface with double curves .",
    "the four models that we have proposed for the four basic particles should be geometrically related in some way to account for the process of beta decay in which a neutron breaks up into a proton , an electron and an anti - neutrino .",
    "the opposite asymptotic behaviour of ah and tn is a good start but the difference in the asymptotic fundamental groups presents a problem .",
    "this suggests that the model of the neutrino should somehow bridge the gap and it argues against the simplicity of the 4-sphere .",
    "we hope to pursue this question .",
    "in all our models we have a natural action of the symmetry group of rotations ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) preserving the metric and the ` asymptotics ' , the details of which differ according to the cases . for the neutral , compact models we interpret ` asymptotic ' to mean the behaviour near the distinguished surface where the 4-manifold intersects 3-space , which is either an @xmath59 or an @xmath10 . for",

    "can be used to construct cartesian coordinates on physical 3-space with the physically required transformation properties under spatial rotations . here",
    "we make essential use of the fact that the complex structures on tn and ah transform as vectors under rotations , as explained at the beginning of sect .",

    "electrically charged ) models we require a spin structure on the 4-manifold while for compact ( neutral ) models we only require a spin structure on the inside , obtained by removing a distinguished surface @xmath2 from the 4-manifold . in this short section",
    "we explain why , in each of the models considered in this paper , the lift of the rotation group action to the spin bundle is an @xmath6-action .",
    "we do not attempt to construct naturally associated spin 1/2 representations , but comment on how this may be done .    for the tn model of the electron",
    ", there is nothing to do since the rotation group action on tn is an @xmath6-action . for the neutron model",
    "we view the required data as the compactification of the proton model ah , not just topologically , but also with the action of the rotation group .",
    "in particular the @xmath59 at infinity is part of the data .",
    "we now simply require the extra data of a spin structure on the inside @xmath127 , i.e. , on ah .",
    "it might be thought that , since the spin structure on ah is unique , there is nothing gained by the additional data , but this is to ignore the interaction with the symmetries",
    ". we must now require the rotation group to lift to the spin bundle , and this may require us to pass to @xmath6 , in which case we label the model as fermionic .",
    "otherwise we call it bosonic . to see that , in principle ,",
    "either case could occur , consider the two manifolds @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we take the left - translation action of @xmath5 on @xmath130 and the standard action on @xmath131 . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the tangent bundle is trivial and we can choose the trivial spin bundle ( though since @xmath130 is not simply - connected there is another choice ) .",
    "the @xmath5-action extends without going to @xmath6 , so @xmath130 is bosonic in our terminology . for @xmath131 the fixed point at the origin of @xmath14",
    "means that we can only lift to the spin bundle after passing to @xmath6 , so @xmath131 is fermionic .    for ah we have to show that , with its action of @xmath5 , it is fermionic .",
    "there are several ways to do this .",
    "perhaps the simplest ( in line with the example @xmath130 above ) is to note that the action is not free and that the isotropy group of a point on the core is @xmath132 .",
    "to lift even this subgroup to the spin bundle over the fixed point requires us to go to the double cover .",
    "a comparison between our models for the electron and proton is illuminating . as we pointed out , @xmath6 acts on the electron but only @xmath5 acts on the proton .",
    "thus the fermionic natures of our two models differ . in one case",
    "it is inherent in the symmetry while in the other it is geometric or topological .",
    "our tentative model for the neutrino is just the round 4-sphere , with a distinguished 2-sphere at infinity given by the decomposition @xmath133 and the corresponding action of @xmath5 .",
    "the inside , got by removing @xmath10 , has an infinite cyclic fundamental group so there are infinitely many spin structures , but only one extends to the whole of @xmath1 . if we pick this , then it is easy to see that the lift of @xmath5 to the spin structure requires us to pass to @xmath6 ( for example we can use an @xmath132 fixing a point at infinity and argue as with the proton ) . thus our model of the neutrino is fermionic .",
    "our discussion so far shows that our geometric approach furnishes fermionic models , but it does not establish that they necessarily give spin 1/2 .",
    "this requires constructing the 2-dimensional representation of @xmath6 and relating it to the asymptotic region .",
    "we expect that the required 2-dimensional representations can be constructed in terms of eigenspaces of the dirac operator on our model manifolds , possibly twisted by a @xmath43-bundle with curvature proportional to one of the harmonic 2-forms discussed in sects .",
