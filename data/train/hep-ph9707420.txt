    "since the last international conference on deep inelastic scattering at rome in april 1996 various new experimental and theoretical results have been obtained on the behavior of the structure functions in deeply inelastic scattering and related quantities .",
    "new measurements were performed for @xmath6 in the low @xmath5 domain , for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . furthermore a refined analysis was carried out for the structure functions in deep - inelastic neutrino scattering . on the theoretical side ,",
    "further investigations of the small @xmath2 behavior of structure functions were carried out and various studies on the description of their heavy flavor contributions were performed .",
    "several very advanced higher order calculations were carried out , among them the 4loop correction for the qcd @xmath9function in the @xmath10 scheme .",
    "different new measurements of the strong coupling constant @xmath11 were performed .",
    "the hera experiments h1 and zeus have now accumulated a substantial statistics in the high @xmath5 range , @xmath12 . as a surprise",
    "both experiments found an indication for an excess of events in this kinematic range over the rate predicted by the standard model , which was firstly reported in february this year .",
    "very intense theoretical investigations followed in the few weeks shortly after and experimental searches for signatures at tevatron , which could be related , were performed . in the following we will give a summary on these aspects which were discussed by the working group on hadron structure .",
    "results of deep inelastic structure function measurements from nmc , ccfr , and the hera experiments were presented for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath7 , and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 at low @xmath18    the zeus and h1 collaborations have now measured @xmath19 down to @xmath5 as low as 0.1 @xmath20 and @xmath2 as low as a few times @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows the hera results , as well as the measurement from e665 , in terms of the total virtual photon - proton cross section @xmath22 versus @xmath23 , the center of mass energy squared of the photon - proton system .",
    "data for real photoproduction ( @xmath5=0 ) are also shown .",
    "the agreement between the measurements from the two hera experiments is rather good .",
    "the data show a smooth transition from a slow growth of the cross section with @xmath23 of the real photoproduction data to a fast rise at higher @xmath5 corresponding to the rise of @xmath19 at low @xmath2 .",
    "the fits to the hera @xmath19 data using the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd evolution equations have been shown to work to an unexpectedly low value of @xmath5 of @xmath241 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "also shown in figure 1 are model predictions by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite , based on regge phenomenology , as well as those of glck , reya and vogt@xcite , based on perturbative qcd .",
    "these give a reasonable description at the lowest @xmath5 and @xmath25 1 gev@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28    the ccfr collaboration presented an updated analysis @xcite of data from neutrino scattering on iron with an improved estimate of quark model parameters and systematic errors .",
    "this analysis supersedes a previous extraction of structure functions @xcite in which a monte carlo technique was used to attempt to reduce the errors on the relative calibration between the hadron and muon energies .",
    "the re - analysis uses the calibration directly from the test beam data taken during the course of the experiment .",
    "the net result is a change of + 2.1% in the relative calibration and an increase in the corresponding systematic error to 1.4% .",
    "the structure functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are extracted making corrections to an isoscalar target , no strange sea , charm mass @xmath31 , and removes the qed radiative corrections and propagator @xmath32 dependence . after correcting for quark - charge and heavy - target effects ,",
    "the ccfr results agree well with those from the nmc , e665 , slac and the bcdms experiments for @xmath2 values greater than 0.1 . for @xmath2 values less than 0.1 , however , the @xmath29 of ccfr is systematically higher , with the discrepancy reaching 15% at a @xmath2 of 0.0125 .",
    "these differences were also present in the previous analysis .",
    "the discrepancy between ccfr and nmc @xcite at low @xmath2 is outside the experimental systematic errors quoted by both groups .",
    "one possibility is that the heavy nuclear target corrections in this region may be different between neutrinos and charged leptons .",
    "this issue can only be resolved with more experimental data .",
    "@xmath33 and r measurements    the nmc collaboration has presented @xcite their results on the measurement of @xmath34  @xcite , in the low @xmath35 kinematic domain ( @xmath36gev@xmath37 ) . a measurement at even lower values of @xmath2 was performed by the h1 collaboration  @xcite . in the one photon exchange approximation ,",
    "the inclusive cross section reads @xmath38 with @xmath39 . at large @xmath40 ,",
    "the weights of @xmath41 and @xmath42 in this equation become comparable .    figure  2 :  measurements of @xmath34 from nmc and h1 , see text .",
    "the h1 collaboration has first measured the cross section at low @xmath40 where @xmath34 becomes negligible in eq .",
    "( [ s1:e : cross ] ) . the structure function @xmath19 obtained in this region",
    "was then calculated using the nlo qcd evolution equations to larger values of @xmath40 .",
    "measuring the cross section at large @xmath40 allows the determination of @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the results are at much lower @xmath2 than the nmc measurements and are in good continuity with them within the h1 error bars , which are still large ,  cf .",
    "figure  2 .    in order to determine @xmath34 without assumptions",
    ", one needs to measure the cross sections at different values of @xmath40 fixing the values of @xmath2 and @xmath35 .",
    "this requires cross section measurements at different values of the center of mass energy , implying a change of beam energies .",
    "a direct change of the beam energies at hera has been widely discussed  @xcite , but is in conflict with the accumulation of integrated luminosity .",
    "another method would consist in the use of radiative events where a real photon is emitted in the initial state by the electron which reduces the beam energy @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic errors are expected to be higher within this method as compared to the measurement with a lowered beam energy . with these measurements , which in principle could be performed in the near future , it may be possible to explore the structure of @xmath43 in the low @xmath2 range  @xcite .",
    "charm contribution to @xmath44    the data collected by the zeus and h1 experiments has allowed a measurement of the charm component to the proton structure function @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "compared to the previous emc measurements , the 1994 hera data allowed an extension of the kinematic domain by two orders of magnitude ( down to @xmath46 for @xmath47 gev@xmath37 ) and show a steep rise of @xmath45 with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "the new preliminary 1995 data shown by the zeus collaboration reach even lower values of @xmath35 and @xmath2 ( @xmath48 gev@xmath37 and @xmath49 ) . the h1 and zeus data are in good agreement as illustrated in figure  3",
    ". these data also agree with the results of the nlo qcd fits performed by both collaborations .",
    "the charm treatment @xcite in the nlo fits is the same for both experiments describing @xmath8 by the boson ",
    "gluon fusion process in nlo  @xcite assuming three light flavors .",
    "it should be noted that the dominant theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath45 measurement arises from the unknown charm mass .",
    "gluon extraction from structure functions    the gluon density can be measured from the scaling violations of the structure function @xmath6 .",
    "the results of qcd fits in nlo from h1 and zeus are shown in figure  4 .",
    "the error bands due to the statistical and systematic errors are also shown .",
    "both of these fits use the fixed flavor number scheme ( see above ) for handling the charm quark . in the case of the h1 analysis , nmc and",
    "bcdms data along with their own data are used in the fit . for the zeus fit , only nmc and",
    "zeus data are used .",
    "the form of the parametrizations for the singlet , non  singlet and gluon distributions are somewhat different between the zeus and h1 fits @xcite .",
    "the two results agree within their errors but the h1 fit is systematically higher than the zeus fit .",
    "the prospects to further constrain the gluon density in the future are discussed below  @xcite .",
    "different updates of the parton parametrizations were reported during this workshop  @xcite which extend earlier analyses accounting for more dynamical effects in the heavy flavor sector .",
    "similar aspects were considered before as well in  @xcite applying the coefficient functions  @xcite in a scenario based on three light flavors . during the last year",
    "more theoretical calculations of the heavy flavor contributions to both the structure functions in neutral and charged current deep inelastic scattering were performed  @xcite and others are in progress  @xcite .",
    "the data on @xmath50 will further improve as more luminosity is collected .",
    "this will allow for more detailed comparisons between the still somewhat different theoretical predictions in the future .",
    "for the small @xmath2 range at hera , an effective parametrization of the structure function @xmath13 was derived  @xcite @xmath51 which updates an earlier analysis  @xcite .",
    "this representation depends only on three parameters , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in the range @xmath55 and the whole range of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath56 exhibits a _ logarithmic _",
    "@xmath2 dependence , and so far no power behavior is indicated .    in another contribution",
    "@xcite , a model for the low @xmath5 behavior of @xmath56 was presented .",
    "this model aims on a description of the transition from the deep - inelastic to the real photon region and describes very well part of the data .",
    "still an improvement is needed to match also the very recent hera data at @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "a unified bfkl - glap approach for the deep inelastic structure functions was presented by kwiecinski et al .",
    "@xcite . among various possibilities of such a description",
    "one well - known way consists in relating the gluon - induced parts of the structure functions to the un - integrated gluon density @xmath58 . in earlier studies , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , however , problems were encountered in the infrared region , @xmath59 , requesting cut  off procedures with a strong parametric dependence . a solution to this problem",
    "was given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the representation @xmath60 was used . for @xmath19 the collinear singularity has to be subtracted as in the case of collinear factorization . if one assumes @xmath61 the dependence of @xmath62 in eq .",

    "@xcite the study of evolution equations for observables has been proposed .",

    "the small @xmath2 resummed contributions for @xmath7 and @xmath79 were also studied in @xcite . for @xmath79 the resummation effect on the photon - specific inhomogeneous solution originates solely from the resummed homogeneous evolution operator .",
    "since the input densities are harder if compared to the proton case the small @xmath2 resummed terms emerge already in the range @xmath80 .",

    "the largest theoretical uncertainty is due to the renormalization and factorization scale , whereas uncertainties due to higher twist effects ( ht ) are estimated to contribute only marginally .",
    "the nutev neutrino experiment , which is currently running at the tevatron , will allow a number of improvements to the analysis .",

    "may be measured in the hera range with experimental errors of @xmath105 a considerable improvement can be obtained fitting systematic effects . the constraints which can be derived for the gluon density in the latter case are illustrated in figure  2 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath103 .",
    "the theoretical errors of different kind for the @xmath3 measurement were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the largest contributions are due to the use of nlo relations for @xmath3 differing in nnlo , @xmath106 and the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties , @xmath107 because these errors are larger than the expected experimental errors one would wish to be able to perform a nnlo analysis , in which these uncertainties become smaller . for this , the 3loop splitting functions have yet to be calculated .",
    "a comparison of direct photon data from a number of experiments to nlo qcd predictions reveals @xcite a pattern of systematic deviations that can not be reproduced by any modification to the parton distributions , see figure  7 .",
    "one possible explanation for the deviations is that they are due to soft gluon emissions , i.e. @xmath108 effects , similar to those encountered in drell - yan production . in the latter case",
    ", a complete description of the soft gluon effects requires a resummation - type calculation .",
    "the effects can be approximated using a gaussian smearing procedure and/or parton shower monte carlo programs .",
    "soft gluon emission steepens the direct photon cross sections at low transverse momentum and , in the case of fixed target direct photon experiments , changes the normalization .",
    "the value of the @xmath109 can be measured directly in diphoton production , as in the drell - yan process , and by measuring the properties of the away - side jet in direct photon production  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical expectation is that the average value of the @xmath109 should increase roughly logarithmically with the center of mass energy .    a complete description of direct photon data , especially at fixed target energies ,",
    "may await a complete resummation calculation of the cross sections .",
    "preliminary work in that direction has already taken place @xcite . as an intermediate step , baer and reno @xcite",
    "have added parton showering to a nlo photon production calculation and have shown that it is possible to describe the rise observed at low @xmath110 in cdf at both @xmath111 = 1800 gev and @xmath111 = 630 gev  @xcite .",
    "previous common wisdom held that fixed target direct photon data served to fix the gluon distribution in the proton , since the dominant mechanism for prompt photon production in proton - proton collisions is gluon - quark scattering .",
    "however , the @xmath109 effects mentioned above , and the residual scale - dependence at nlo of the direct photon theory , can affect both the slope and normalizations of the cross sections .    an attempt has been made to incorporate the fixed target direct photon data from the fermilab experiment e706",
    "@xcite into the cteq global fitting program , first correcting for the soft - gluon ( @xmath109 ) effects .",
    "the direct photon data probe the gluon distribution up to very high values of @xmath112 .",
    "the gluon distribution obtained from the fit agrees well with that from cteq4 m .",
    "figure  7 :  the quantity ( data - theory)/theory plotted vs @xmath113 for a number of direct photon experiments .",
    "theory corresponds to nlo order qcd with cteq2 m parton distribution functions .",
    "the average @xmath109 values used ( 1.15 gev/@xmath114 at @xmath111 = 31.5 and 1.30 gev/@xmath114 at 38.7 gev ) agree with the @xmath109 values measured in drell - yan experiments in similar kinematic regimes and with the direct determination of the event @xmath109 from the e706 data .",
    "the @xmath109-corrected cross sections describe well the slope and the normalization of the data , even at the highest values of @xmath2 .",
    "jet rates at the tevatron    the jet production at the tevatron serves as a crucial venue for the measurement of the gluon distribution , the determination of @xmath115 , and probing of parton distributions at highest @xmath2 and @xmath32 values @xcite .    the leading order cross sections for jet production are proportional to @xmath116 , and to @xmath117 for gluon - gluon scattering , @xmath118 for gluon - quark scattering , and @xmath119 for quark - quark scattering . in the mid - range of the inclusive central jet data , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 scattering dominate .",
    "this is a region where systematic errors , both theory and experiment , are smallest and where the theory agrees well with the data .",
    "the cdf and d0 cross sections are also within relatively good agreement within this range @xcite . at high values of @xmath123",
    ", cdf has reported an excess over standard theoretical predictions .",
    "the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite jet data have been included in a global parton distribution analysis ( cteq4 m ) @xcite .",
    "the jet inclusive data serve to stabilize the fits and to constrain the gluon distribution in the @xmath2 range from 0.05 to 0.22 .",
    "the inclusive jet data prefer a value of @xmath115 of 0.116 to 0.118 , consistent with the global fit results .",
    "as mentioned previously , cdf has reported an excess in the inclusive cross section at the highest values of transverse energy .",
    "this may be due to new physics or to a possible modification of the parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "the quark distributions in the @xmath2 and @xmath32 range @xmath124 corresponding to high @xmath123 central jet production are fairly well - constrained , but there is greater flexibility and uncertainty in the gluon distribution .",
    "this freedom is largely due to two sources : the theoretical uncertainties in fixed target direct photon production and the lack of other data in current global fits to constrain the gluon distribution at high @xmath2 .",
    "figure  8 :  the momentum - transfer - squared @xmath125 plotted as a function of the larger of the @xmath2 values in the parton - parton collision for the cdf differential dijet cross section . the box indicates the region of the hera excess .",
    "one can not conclude that the excess is due to gluons , just that the data currently used in the global fits allow for a description of the excess by a larger gluon distribution .",
    "no definite conclusions can be drawn about the larger gluon distribution without the use of additional data .",
    "note also that since the dominant jet production mechanism in this @xmath123 range is quark - quark scattering , any appreciable modification to the jet cross section requires a much larger modification of the gluon distribution .",
    "this exercise with the high @xmath123 jet distribution also points out the need for flexibility in the parameterization of parton distributions , especially when extrapolating to new regions of @xmath2 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "one can specifically probe high values of @xmath2 by measuring the differential dijet cross section . in the cdf differential dijet analysis @xcite , one jet ( the trigger jet )",
    "is required to be central ( 0.1 @xmath126 0.7 ) while the other jet ( the probe jet ) is allowed to have an @xmath127 value of up to 3 .",
    "the trigger and probe jets are the two highest @xmath123 jets in the event .",
    "high @xmath123 scatters in which the probe jet is at high rapidity correspond to collisions of a parton at moderate @xmath2 ( 0.050.3 ) with a high @xmath2 parton ( up to @xmath128 ) at very high @xmath32 ( up to @xmath129 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath32 values probed overlap ( and in some cases exceed ) those in the hera high @xmath2 and @xmath32 analysis , as shown in figure  8 .",
    "any modifications to the parton distributions to explain the hera high @xmath2 and @xmath32 results @xcite would have a similar impact on the differential dijet data .",
    "the data should also serve to test the hypothesis of a larger gluon at high @xmath2 .",
    "one complication is that for large trigger jet @xmath123 values and high probe jet rapidities , the cross section is dominated by multijet final states due to the larger phase space .",
    "one either needs to compare to higher order calculations or to measure the cross sections as a function of the parton light - cone momentum fractions @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and the dijet pseudorapidity difference @xmath132 * , as suggested by ellis and soper  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of this type should be less sensitive to higher order corrections and should provide a more definitive statement on the parton distributions at high @xmath2 and @xmath32 .",
    "event rates at hera    the zeus and h1 experiments have reported on an excess of events above standard model predictions at high @xmath5 and large values of @xmath2 @xcite . with a total luminosity of @xmath133",

    "results of this analysis were reported in  @xcite .",
    "the current bounds for leptoquarks associated to the 1st fermion family are  @xcite  : @xmath161 the corresponding limits for vector leptoquarks are expected to be larger  @xcite , since the pair production cross section is larger by a factor of at least @xmath162 for a factorization mass of @xmath163  @xcite . whereas leptoquarks with @xmath164 are ruled out at @xmath165 by the tevatron bounds , those with @xmath166 are still ( marginally ) allowed .",
    "r - parity violating susy    supersymmetric theories with @xmath34-parity breaking bear also scalar leptoquark states  @xcite . the tight bounds from tevatron for states with @xmath167 do not apply to this class of leptoquarks",

    "a feed  back of this uncertainty into the range of lower @xmath2 values in qcd fits is not excluded and was studied in @xcite under a series of assumptions . although more studies are needed the above mentioned uncertainty is essentially confirmed and the excess of events can not be attributed to an uncertainty in the parton densities currently .",

    "the corresponding effects at slc , lep1 and lep2 , however , are smaller than 1%  @xcite assuming the couplings  ( [ s1:e : coup ] ) and can thus not be detected for leptoquarks in this mass range .",
    "on the other hand , lep2 may constrain related contact interaction terms up to scales of @xmath187  @xcite on the basis of the data being accumulated until the end of this year .",
    "furthermore one may as well search for some specific signatures associated to leptoquarks which emerge in scenarios with supersymmetric models with @xmath34parity violation .",
    "there has been considerable progress in the measurement of the deep inelastic scattering structure functions during the last year . with the increased luminosity , which will be collected by the hera experiments until dis  98",

    "resummed anomalous dimension @xmath188 a more complete analysis of the small @xmath2 behavior of @xmath6 can be performed . to be able to analyze also the behavior of the structure functions for lower values of @xmath5 the twist4 anomalous dimensions need to be known .",
    "the most exciting question is certainly whether or not the excess of neutral current events in the high @xmath5 region of hera will persist adding in the data of the 1997 runs , and whether such an excess is also present in the charged current data",
