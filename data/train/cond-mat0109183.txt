    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices have been attracting increasing attention from both theorists @xcite and experimentalists @xcite .",
    "people are interested in how the interaction and coherence of this system affect the interesting phenomena observed with dilute cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , such as landau - zener tunneling and bloch oscillations .",
    "recent studies have shown that these phenomena are indeed strongly influenced by the interaction between atoms .",
    "a series of novel effects have been discovered , including the nonlinear landau - zener tunneling @xcite , the breakdown of bloch oscillations @xcite , and dynamical instability @xcite .",
    "there are similar nonlinear periodic systems in other fields , for example , the system of the nonlinear guided waves in a periodic layered medium @xcite .    in a one dimensional optical lattice created by two counter - propagating off - resonance laser beams ,",
    "a bec is essentially a one dimensional system when the lateral motion can be either neglected @xcite or confined @xcite .",
    "its grand canonical hamiltonian is [ eq : h ] h=_-^x  \\{^*(-12 ^2x^2+v)+c2||^4-||^2 } , where @xmath0 is the macroscopic wave function of the bec . in the above equation ,",
    "all the variables are scaled to be dimensionless with the system s basic parameters , the atomic mass @xmath1 , the wave number @xmath2 of the two laser lights , and the average density @xmath3 of the bec .",
    "the strength of the periodic potential @xmath4 is in units of @xmath5 , the wave function @xmath0 in units of @xmath6 , @xmath7 in units of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in units of @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the @xmath13-wave scattering length . a two dimensional version of this system has also received some attention @xcite .    in this brief report",
    ", we study the bloch bands and bloch waves of a bec in an optical lattice , and present new results that we were unable to obtain in our previous studies in refs.@xcite .",
    "these new results are possible now due primarily to a new development , an exact solution found in ref.@xcite .",
    "as bloch bands and bloch waves are the two most important concepts in understanding a linear periodic system , they shall also play crucial roles in the physics of the nonlinear periodic system ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "bloch waves are the extremum states of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) of the form [ eq : bloch ] ( x , t)=e^ikx_k(x ) , where @xmath14 is a periodic function of period @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the bloch wave number .",
    "each bloch wave state ( [ eq : bloch ] ) satisfies the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation [ eq : nlsp ] -12(x+ik)^2_k + c|_k|^2_k+vx_k=_k , as can be verified by variation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "bloch bands are given by the set of eigenenergies @xmath17 .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we studied the tunneling between the two lowest bands to see how it is affected by the interaction .",
    "we found that the tunneling is described by a revised landau - zener model , which we call the nonlinear landau - zener model .",
    "this model predicts a dramatic change in the band structure , which is a loop appearing at the brillouin zone edge @xmath18 for @xmath19 ( see fig.[fig : lobandk ] ) .",
    "a direct consequence of this loop structure is the breakdown of the bloch oscillations due to the non - zero adiabatic tunneling into the upper band .",
    "the loop structure is confirmed by an exact solution found recently by bronski _ et al._(eq.(10 ) of ref.@xcite ) , which assumes a much simpler form in terms of our notations , [ eq : x ]",
    "_ b(x)=a_+e^ix2 + a_-e^-ix2 , where @xmath20 . substituting it into eq.([eq : nlsp ] ) , we have @xmath21 .",
    "this solution only exists when @xmath22 , and is a bloch wave at the edge of the brillouin zone , @xmath23 .",
    "this bloch wave carries a non - zero velocity , @xmath24 , while its complex conjugate has an opposite velocity .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the behavior in a linear periodic system , in which bloch waves at the zone edge always have zero velocity .",
    "this difference confirms the looped band structure .",
    "the solution @xmath25 and its complex conjugate are the two degenerate states at the crossing point @xmath26 ( fig.[fig : lobandk ] ) . the non - zero velocity carried by this bloch wave is a manifestation of superfluidity of bec . for free particles ,",
    "the flow @xmath27 is stopped completely by bragg scattering from the periodic potential ; for the bec , the flow can no longer be stopped when the superfluidity is strong , that is , @xmath28 .",
    "this loop structure is further supported by our numerical calculation of the lowest band @xmath17 , as shown in fig.[fig : gb ] .",
    "it is evident that the slope @xmath29 at the zone edge @xmath18 becomes non - zero as the interaction strength @xmath30 is increased over the periodic potential strength @xmath4 , a clear indication of the loop structure . however , due to the limitation of our numerical method @xcite , we are unable to produce directly the loop . an improved numerical method is being developed to calculate the loop and the higher bloch bands .",
    "in our second paper @xcite , we studied the superfluidity and stability of the bloch waves in the lowest band ( excluding the loop ) .",
    "we found that the bloch waves in the middle of the brillouin zone represent super - flows , and the other bloch waves towards the zone edge have both a landau instability and a dynamical instability .",
    "moreover , we found that these instabilities can disappear from all these bloch waves when the atomic interaction is beyond certain critical values for a fixed lattice strength .",
    "for easy reference , we call the critical value for the landau instability @xmath31 , and the critical value for the dynamical instability @xmath32 . in that work ,",
    "we were unable to find these two critical values because our numerical method was not good enough to find accurate bloch waves at the zone edge .",
    "now the exact solution @xmath25 allows us to overcome the difficulty and calculate these two critical values , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is done by studying the stabilities of the bloch wave @xmath25 .",
    "since the bloch wave at the zone edge is the last one to become stable either in terms of the landau instability or dynamically , the critical values of @xmath30 for @xmath25 to become stable are just @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the physical significance of the two critical values , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , lies in the way how the bloch states at @xmath33 are achieved experimentally : the bloch state at @xmath34 is first prepared then driven to the desired bloch states at @xmath33 by accelerating the optical lattice@xcite .",
    "therefore , as the only point connecting the loop to the rest of the bloch band , a stable @xmath25 means that the bloch states on the loop can be accessed and studied experimentally by accelerating the optical lattice .",
    "we first study the landau instability by analyzing how the energy of the system deviates under a small perturbation .",
    "since the system is periodic , we are allowed to write the perturbation as [ eq : pert ] = _ b+e^ix2(u(x , q)e^iqx+v^*(x , q)e^-iqx ) , where @xmath35 ranges between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , labelling the perturbation mode , and the perturbation functions @xmath38 and @xmath4 have a periodicity of @xmath15 in @xmath7 .",
    "then the energy deviation caused by this perturbation is e=_-^dx m(q ) , where m(q)= , with ( k)=-12(x + ik)^2 -vx+c-18 and _ b^2=c+2c - vce^-ix+ c-2ce^-2ix .",
    "if @xmath39 is positive definite for all @xmath40 , the bloch wave @xmath25 is a local minimum and a super - flow .",
    "otherwise , @xmath41 can be negative for some @xmath35 ; the bloch wave is a saddle point and has a landau instability .",
    "as already noticed in ref.@xcite , the positive definiteness of the matrices @xmath39 for all @xmath35 s is guaranteed by the positive definiteness of @xmath42 .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath42 for different values of @xmath30 with a fixed @xmath4 , we obtain the critical value @xmath31 , which is shown as a dashed line in fig.[fig : cv ] .",
    "for the intersection point @xmath43 at @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 .",
    "the dynamical stability of the bloch wave @xmath25 is studied by linearizing the gross - pitaevskii equation [ eq : nlsd ] it= -12 ^ 2x^2 + c||^2+vx . with a procedure similar to the above",
    ", we arrive at the linearized dynamical equation [ eq : first ] it = m(q ) ,  = .",
    "the dynamical stability is determined by the matrix @xmath46 .",
    "if all @xmath46 for @xmath40 have no complex eigenvalues , then @xmath25 is dynamically stable ; otherwise , it is unstable .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the dynamical instability always starts at the perturbation mode @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we only need to diagonalize @xmath48 to find the critical value @xmath32 . the results are shown as the solid line in fig.[fig : cv ] , where the intersection @xmath49 at @xmath44 is precisely @xmath50 .",
    "this lower bound of the critical value @xmath32 simply means that when @xmath51 , any periodic potential brings the dynamical instability into the system .",
    "the value of @xmath32 at point @xmath49 is confirmed by analyzing the limiting case @xmath52 , where the matrix @xmath48 can be approximated with a @xmath53 matrix m(1/2 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix can be found exactly ; all of them are real only when @xmath54 .",
    "note that the point @xmath49 must be understood in a sense that @xmath55 as @xmath56 since precisely at @xmath44 the system has no dynamical instability . as one may get an impression from fig.[fig : cv ] that the asymptotic behavior of the two curves at large @xmath4 is linear , we want to stress that it is not .",
    "our numerical results show that the asymptotic behavior undergoes very small oscillations along a straight line , which we have no complete understanding .    besides the existence of the loop structure shown in fig.[fig : lobandk ] , we have not discussed the properties of the states on the loop due to the difficulty finding these loop states accurately . here",
    "we offer a glimpse of these loop states and their properties . around the crossing point @xmath26 ( fig.[fig : lobandk ] ) @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , the bloch wave can be approximated to the zeroth oder of @xmath59 as ( x)=+2e^ikx --2e^i(k-1)x , where @xmath60 .",
    "numerical investigations show that most of these loop states are all saddle points which can be either dynamically stable or unstable .",
    "more numerical calculations are needed to further confirm this .    finally , we make two remarks .",
    "first , the way of defining bloch waves and bloch bands for the nonlinear system ( [ eq : h ] ) at the beginning is a natural generalization from the linear periodic system .",
    "nevertheless , there is an essential difference due to the nonlinearity . in the linear system ( @xmath61 ) , the bloch waves are the only extremum states of its hamiltonian or the only eigenfunctions of eq.([eq : nlsp ] ) ; for the nonlinear system ( [ eq : h ] ) , there are possible extremum states that are not bloch waves .",
    "second , it is interesting to put the dynamical instability which is discussed in this report and in ref.@xcite into perspective .",
    "usually , a quantum dynamics is a regular motion because it has discrete eigenvalues thus an almost periodic motion no matter its corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic or not . in this sense",
    ", quantum chaos has been called `` pseudochaos''@xcite . on contrary , the dynamical instability that we have discussed is `` true '' quantum dynamical chaos that deserves more attention in the future .    on the other hand , with the madelung transformation @xmath62 the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nlsd ] ) can be turned into a set of equations of fluid dynamics . in this regard",
    ", the quantum dynamical instability should be related to the turbulence in the fluid dynamics , and we may call it `` quantum turbulence '' .",
