    "it is well known that the environment in which a galaxy inhabits has a profound impact upon its evolution in terms of defining both its structural properties and star - formation histories , with passively - evolving ellipticals , s0s and , at lower masses dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , dominating cluster cores whereas in field regions galaxies are typically star - forming spirals .",
    "these trends have been quantified through the morphology ",
    "density @xcite and star formation ( sf)density relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while some of the diminution in star - formation seen in cluster galaxies with respect to the field population could be attributed to the different morphological compositions of the two environments , even at fixed morphology , the star - formation rate ( sfr ) of cluster galaxies is found to be lower than in the field @xcite , indicating separate processes at least partially shape these relations .",
    "empirically the s0s of local clusters are mostly replaced by star - forming spirals at @xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may be completely absent by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "similarly , we see a marked decline in the cluster de population out to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a simple interpretation is that clusters accreted gas - rich , star - forming spirals at @xmath10.51 and then these galaxies were transformed somehow into the passive s0s and des found in clusters at @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is vital at this point that we place clusters within the current @xmath11cdm cosmological models that have proved able to successfully reproduce statistically the growth of cosmic large - scale structure . in these models",
    "structure formation occurs hierarchically @xcite , and so clusters are not isolated , but represent the most massive and dynamically immature systems , located at the intersections of filaments , continuously accreting galaxies and galaxy groups along these filaments or directly from the field .",
    "indeed , as @xcite show , @xmath120% of galaxies in local clusters were accreted since @xmath13 , meaning that their transformation must be much more wide - spread , rapid , and still ongoing .",
    "numerous mechanisms have been proposed to deplete the reservoir of gas in infalling spirals , cutting off the fuel supply for further star formation , as well as cause their morphological transformation , resulting in passive s0s and des , such as ram - pressure and/or tidal stripping , galaxy merging ( including agn feedback ) , harassment and starvation ( for reviews see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these environmental processes are predicted to quench the star formation over diverse time - scales ( e.g. @xmath14yr for ram - pressure stripping ; @xmath15yr for starvation ) .",
    "some mechanisms are additionally expected to include an intermediate starburst and possible subsequent post - starburst phase ( e.g. ram - pressure or merger - induced nuclear starbursts ) .",
    "a number of studies have attempted to distinguish among the various environmental processes by identifying and classifying various promising classes of transition galaxies , such as post - starburst and/or e+a galaxies @xcite , interaction - induced starbursts @xcite , and passive / red spirals @xcite , which seem to indicate that more than one mechanism is required . however",
    ", a critical handicap facing many of these studies is their reliance on a single indicator of current / recent star formation , which may well be sensitive towards only a certain class ( or subset ) of transition population .",
    "for example , many analyses of the impact of the cluster environment were based on spectra obtained from fibre - based spectrographs .",
    "these are largely insensitive to the ongoing effects of ram - pressure stripping , which has been observed to produce _ truncated _ h@xmath16 and hi disks in infalling spirals @xcite , but which will appear unaffected when observed through fibres covering only the galaxy cores .",
    "furthermore , early mid - infrared ( _ iso _ ) and radio studies of clusters revealed populations of luminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath17 ; lirgs ) and near - lirgs @xcite , that implied that the sfrs derived from uv or optical diagnostics ( e.g. oii ) underestimated the true sfrs by @xmath1803@xmath19 ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the age - dependence of this dust obscuration ( the stars responsible for the oii emission are younger and more obscured than those which produce absorption in h@xmath20 ) can lead to dusty star - bursts being in fact classified as post - starburst galaxies @xcite .    to fully understand the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy evolution given the above issues , and to distinguish among the diverse physical mechanisms proposed to transform cluster galaxies , a new multi - faceted approach is required .",
    "firstly , a complete census of star formation in and around clusters is mandatory , based on _ global _ sfr measures , and which fully accounts for dust obscuration .",
    "this necessitates a multi - wavelength approach including infrared data sensitive to the obscured sf component",
    ".    secondly , by comparison of the specific - sfrs ( or equivalently birthrate parameter ) to the observed tight mass - dependent sequence seen in field spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it becomes possible to distinguish among normal star - forming galaxies , starbursts , passive galaxies , and transitional galaxies ( e.g. green - valley objects ) whose specific - sfrs are intermediate between the passive and star - forming sequences , and presumably are in the process of having their star formation quenched .",
    "related to this is the ability to distinguish between normally star - forming spirals who are forming stars quiescently over their entire disks and galaxies undergoing nuclear starbursts , i.e. the _ nature _ of the star formation .",
    "even if the measured specific - sfrs are the same , whereas the former is likely evolving quiescently , the latter is likely a temporary state , possibly induced by interaction with its environment , and could thus represent one phase of the transformation of that galaxy .",
    "clearly this can be achieved by resolving where the star formation occurs within a galaxy , but even if all we have is the globally - measured spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , there are several diagnostics within the sed , such as the irx-@xmath7 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the fir ",
    "radio colours @xcite , sensitive to the intensity of the current star formation within a galaxy .    finally , to fully distinguish among the diverse environmental processes transforming galaxies",
    ", it will often be necessary to resolve its impact on the galaxy , either in terms of its dynamical state ( via measurements of its kinematics ) or its stellar population ( e.g. via colour gradients , h@xmath16 profiles ) .",
    "for example , ram - pressure stripping quenches star - formation from the outside - in , producing truncated h@xmath16 profiles , while starvation results in a global decline in the star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "neither of these processes should affect the kinematics of the galaxy . instead gravitational mechanisms such as merging , harassment or tidal forces should be recognisable by their kinematic imprints .",
    "it is with all of the above in mind that we are undertaking the access multi - wavelength survey of the shapley supercluster core ( ssc ) , the most massive and dynamically active structure in the local ( @xmath21 ) universe .",
    "the target has been chosen since the most dramatic effects of the hierarchical assembly of structure on galaxy evolution should occur in supercluster . here",
    "the infall and encounter velocities of galaxies are greatest ( @xmath22000kms@xmath23 ) , groups and clusters are still merging , and significant numbers of galaxies will be encountering the dense intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of the cluster environment for the first time .",
    "the shapley supercluster was identified as the largest overdensity of galaxies and clusters in the @xmath21 universe in an apm survey of galaxies covering the entire southern sky @xcite and confirmed by early x - ray studies @xcite . in the original abell catalogue @xcite ,",
    "the core of the shapley supercluster was found to be represented by a single cluster ( a3558@xmath24shapley  8) of optical richness  4 , inconsistent with the observed velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "early x - ray observations from _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ @xcite resolved this by discovering that the core in fact comprises of a chain three merging clusters , a3558 , sc1327 - 312 and sc1329 - 313 .",
    "the ssc in this paper refers to these three clusters , along with the two associated abell clusters on either side , a3562 and a3556 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a general description ) .    in ( * ? ?",
    "* paper i ) we introduced the survey as well as presented an analysis of the @xmath25-band data . in ( * ? ? ?",

    "ultraviolet and _ spitzer _ infrared observations of the ssc , producing both ultraviolet and infrared luminosity functions .",
    "these data were used to build a _",
    "complete _ and _ unbiased _ census of star formation in galaxies belonging to the ssc which we use here . by assembling a comprehensive panchromatic ( fuv  fir ) dataset for the ssc we were able to fully account for",
    "both obscured and unobscured star - formation , and by dealing with _",
    "global _ photometric measurements , were independent of aperture biases . using this approach",
    ", we showed that just 20 per cent of the global sfr of @xmath26 was visible directly in the ultraviolet continuum , while @xmath270 per cent was reprocessed by dust and emitted in the infrared .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of this already comprehensive panchromatic dataset and census of star formation , to which we add 1.4ghz radio continuum data from @xcite , in order to examine in unprecedented detail the _ nature _ of star formation in cluster galaxies . using several quite independent diagnostics of the quantity and intensity of star formation , we carefully develop a coherent picture of the types of star formation activity in these galaxies , measuring the relative importance of quiescent star - formation occurring within normal spiral arms and nuclear star - bursts which may have been triggered by interaction between the galaxy and its environment . in particular , we attempt to discern whether star - formation within cluster galaxies can be considered in a manner consistent with being drawn from the field population , or if there is a significant cluster - specific mode of star - formation",
    ".    in   [ sec : data ] we present our multi - wavelength datasets , and in   [ sec : bimodal ] we combine our _ spitzer_/mips 24@xmath28 m and @xmath25-band data to establish the bimodal distribution in infrared colour ( @xmath29 ) of supercluster galaxies , which can be understood as another manifestation of the well known broad division of galaxies into star - forming spiral and passively - evolving early - type populations . given the close correspondences between 24@xmath28 m and @xmath25-band luminosities to sfrs and stellar masses respectively , the inference of @xmath29 as a natural proxy for specific - sfr is clear . in the next two sections we present two apparently disparate and unrelated analyses , the irx-@xmath7 (   [ sec : irx ] ) and fir  radio (   [ sec : radio ] ) relations .",
    "these relations provide two independent diagnostics of the _ nature _ of star formation among the supercluster galaxy population , allowing us to distinguish between quiescent star formation over a spiral disk and intense nuclear starbursts and/or agn .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : discuss ] we piece together all of the lines of evidence put forward in sections  [ sec : bimodal][sec : radio ] to form a coherent picture of the dominant modes of star formation taking place within the shapley supercluster core , and the diverse populations of transforming galaxies , suggesting a variety of evolutionary pathways from infalling spiral to passive lenticular .",

    "the ultraviolet colour however is quite sensitive also to the effective age of the stellar population , leading @xcite to suggest that whereas in starbursts , the ultraviolet emission comes predominately from current star formation processes , in normal star - forming systems it comes primarily from the more evolved , non - ionizing stellar population ( @xmath120100myr ) .    in figure  [ irxbeta ]",

    "this means that if s0 bulges are to have been built up by star formation since @xmath13 , this could have occurred rapidly over a few @xmath174yr at @xmath13 or if taking place later ( @xmath175 ) must be taking place over much longer time - scales ( @xmath166gyr ) .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to transform infalling spiral galaxies into passive s0s which include intermediate starburst and possible subsequent post - starburst phases ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , starbursts could be initiated in galaxies during the early phases of ram - pressure stripping as the interaction of the intracluster gas act to compresses their molecular clouds @xcite , while gravitational shocks induced by repeated high - velocity encounters ( harassment ; * ? ? ? * ) or low - velocity encounters / mergers ( often in infalling groups  pre - processing ; * ? ? ? * ) could induce a bar driving gas inwards and feeding a nuclear starburst .",
    "observationally @xcite indicated that 5070 per cent of the infalling population in clusters were interacting or merging and triggering star formation . @xcite and @xcite found enhanced star formation along filaments feeding rich clusters and suggested that these dense galaxy environments favoured gravitational interactions that could induce the observed starbursts .",
    "@xcite identified a population of starburst galaxies at the cluster virial radius , and suggested that these were triggered by interaction between the infalling galaxy and the shock boundary between the hot , dense icm and the colder , diffuse infalling gas from outside the cluster .",
    "@xcite predicted that when clusters merge they develop shocks in the icm , which could lead to starbursts in galaxies as they pass through them , a theory supported by a number of mir / radio - based surveys who found an excess of dusty star - forming galaxies in merging clusters @xcite , but see also @xcite and @xcite for counterexamples ..",
    "we identified starburst galaxies in the shapley supercluster core via three methods : ( i ) their location above the specific - sfr@xmath4 relation or equivalently having @xmath176 ( blue symbols in figs .",
    "[ optmir70 ] and  [ irxbeta ] ) ; ( ii ) their location along the starbust irx@xmath7 relation of @xcite ( blue shaded region of fig .",
    "[ irxbeta ] ) ; or ( iii ) having unresolved 24@xmath28 m emission indicative of a nuclear starburst ( indicated by ringed symbols in fig .",
    "[ irxbeta ] ) .",
    "there is significant overlap among these three groups indicating good consistency between these classifications : two - thirds of the @xmath176 galaxies above @xmath177mjy ( where we can separate resolved and point - like sources ) remain unresolved ; while 60% of galaxies consistent with the starburst irx@xmath7 also have @xmath176 .",
    "independent of which method we consider , we identify @xmath103 starburst galaxies across the survey , contributing just @xmath185% of the global sfr within the supercluster core .",
    "we defer an investigation of the triggering of these starbursts to a future work , but note here that their location primarily along the filament connecting a3562 and a3558 is indicative of a environment - related cause .",
    "the dominant contributor ( @xmath275 per cent ) to the global sfr budget in the shapley supercluster is rather spiral galaxies undergoing normal , quiescent star formation across their disks , in a manner indistinguishable from the general field population .",
    "this is manifest firstly by the star - forming sequence identified in figure  [ optmir ] , and which comprises essentially all the star - formation in the supercluster , being indistinguishable from that obtained from the sample of local field spiral galaxies observed within sings ( green symbols in fig .",
    "[ sings ] ) , while the derived specific - sfrs ( fig .",
    "[ ssfr ] ) are consistent with the specific - sfr@xmath4 relations of local field galaxies obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . secondly the mid - infrared colours ( @xmath178 ; fig .  [ radioircols ] ) and fir  radio ratios ( fig .  [ radioircols ] ) observed for most galaxies on the star - forming sequence are best described by the @xmath179 model infrared seds of @xcite , corresponding to dust heated by relatively low - intensity and diffuse star - formation taking place over an extended disk @xcite , as observed for typical local spirals in the sings sample @xcite .",
    "finally , in the irx@xmath7 plot of figure  [ irxbeta ] we find that the bulk of the star - forming galaxies follow a single dust opacity - reddening relation that is however significantly offset from the empirical starburst relation of @xcite , having systematically redder ultraviolet colours for the same level of obscuration ( irx ) .",
    "the observed irx@xmath7 relation is similar to those seen by other surveys of local spiral galaxies , and is consistent with a contribution to the uv flux from a dominant older stellar population .",
    "these three independent lines of evidence from diverse parts of the spectral energy distribution all confirm that the bulk of star - forming galaxies in the supercluster are forming stars in a manner indistinguishable from the general field population , consistent with them being galaxies recently accreted from the field , but yet to encounter the dense icm or be affected by cluster - related processes .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions drawn by @xcite from the observed composite radial gradients in the fraction of mir luminous star - forming galaxies ( @xmath180 ) for 30 massive clusters at @xmath181 .",
    "the observed gradual increase of @xmath180 with clustercentric radius was found to be consistent to first order with the predicted radial trends from numerical simulations in which the star - forming galaxies are identified with galaxies infalling into massive clusters for the first time . from these simulations ,",
    "the fraction of infalling galaxies expected to be observed in cluster surveys is seen to increase approximately linearly with projected radius to around twice the virial radius ( to be compared with the trends of e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this association of the cluster star - forming population with the infalling field population was first made by @xcite and @xcite to explain the origin of the sf - density relation and the observed radial population gradients in star - formation rates and colours of cluster galaxies within the simple model of clusters being built up through the accretion of field galaxies . as we discussed in paper ii , the overall normalization of the infrared lf and hence cluster sfr is @xmath18253@xmath19 that which we would expect if the star - forming galaxies were simply interlopers whose line - of - sight velocities happen to lie within the redshift range of the supercluster .",
    "hence they must instead be physically associated with the observed overdensity .",
    "equally they are not evenly distributed over the whole survey region , but preferentially lie along , or close to , the filamentary structure connecting the clusters abell 3558 and abell 3562 , if not within the cores of either cluster .",
    "this points towards them being generally located in the infall regions , some @xmath320.55mpc from their nearest cluster ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "the domination of the observed cluster star - forming population by normal star - forming spiral galaxies who are on their first infall into the cluster and have yet to be affected by the dense environment makes it much more difficult to disentangle those galaxies which are _ currently _ in the process of being transformed from star - forming spiral to passive lenticular ( perhaps via a short starburst phase ) , and ultimately distinguish among the possible physical mechanisms behind this transformation .",
    "in particular it limits the sensitivity of the infrared or ultraviolet luminosity functions to these processes , and could explain the full consistency between the infrared luminosity functions observed in local clusters ( coma , abell 3266 and shapley ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) and those seen in the field , as discussed paper ii .",
    "however we identify a few candidate sub - populations which could represent diverse phases in this transformation : ( i ) galaxies with intermediate infrared colours ( @xmath183 ) lying between the star - forming and passive sequences , covering a region in colour - space that a star - forming galaxy must pass through as it is being quenched ; ( ii ) the nuclear starburst population , which could indicate a short phase of star - formation triggered via an interaction or bar instability which could serve to build up the bulge of an s0 .",
    "these sub - populations are the prime candidates for our ongoing integral - field spectroscopic survey with wifes , and will be investigated further in future papers .",
    "we have presented an analysis of panoramic _",
    "spitzer_/mips mid- and far - infrared ( mir / fir ) and _ galex _ ultraviolet imaging of the most massive and dynamically active structure in the local universe , the shapley supercluster at @xmath0 , covering the five clusters which make up the supercluster core . combining this with existing spectroscopic data from 814 confirmed supercluster members and 1.4ghz radio continuum maps , these represent the largest complete census of star - formation ( both obscured and unobscured ) in local cluster galaxies to date , extending down to @xmath1020.@xmath2 . we have taken advantage of this comprehensive panchromatic dataset and census of star formation , in order to perform the kind of detailed analysis of the nature of star formation in cluster galaxies , previously limited to local field galaxy surveys such as sings @xcite .",
    "we observed a robust bimodality in the infrared ( @xmath3 ) galaxy colours , which we were able to identify as another manifestation of the broad split into star - forming , blue spiral and passive , red elliptical galaxy populations seen in uv - optical surveys .",
    "this diagnostic also allows the identification of galaxies in the process of having their star formation quenched as the infrared analogue of the ultraviolet `` green valley '' population .",
    "the bulk of supercluster galaxies on the star - forming sequence have specific - sfrs consistent with local field specific - sfr@xmath4 relations of elbaz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and form a tight fir  radio correlation ( 0.24dex ) confirming that their fir emission is due to star formation .    using several quite independent diagnostics of the quantity and intensity of star formation",
    ", we have developed a coherent picture of the types of star formation found within cluster galaxies , showing that the dominant mode , contributing 85 per cent of the global sfr , is quiescent star formation within spiral disks , as manifest by the observed sequence in the @xmath5)(@xmath6 ) plane  the irx-@xmath7 relation ",
    "significantly offset from the starburst relation of @xcite , while their fir  radio colours indicate dust heated by low - intensity star formation . just 15 per cent of the global sfr is due to nuclear starbursts , that could represent star formation triggered by interaction of galaxies with their environment .",
    "the vast majority of star formation seen in cluster galaxies comes from normal infalling spirals who have yet to be affected by the cluster environment .    in future works",
    "we will examine the environmental trends in star formation , and identify and quantify various classes of galaxies in the process of being transformed from star - forming spiral to passive s0 .",
    "these transition galaxies are being targeted for integral - field spectroscopy as part of a long - term programme using the wifes ifu - spectrograph @xcite on the 2.3-m anu telescope at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "these detailed observations will allow the mechanism by which the global sfr in these galaxies is being quenched to be resolved and identified .",
    "for example , ongoing ram - pressure stripping can be seen as knots of h@xmath16 emission being swept off the galaxies @xcite by their passage through the dense icm @xcite , resulting in truncated h@xmath16 profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , beyond which the characteristic post - starburst signatures of deep balmer absorption - lines may be found @xcite .",

    "<S> we take advantage of this comprehensive panchromatic dataset to perform a detailed analysis of the _ nature _ of star formation in cluster galaxies of the kind previously limited to local field galaxy surveys such as sings , using several quite independent diagnostics of the quantity and intensity of star formation to develop a coherent view of the types of star formation within cluster galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe a robust bimodality in the infrared ( @xmath3 ) galaxy colours , which we are able to identify as another manifestation of the broad split into star - forming spiral and passive elliptical galaxy populations seen in uv - optical surveys . </S>",
    "<S> this diagnostic also allows the identification of galaxies in the process of having their star formation quenched as the infrared analogue to the ultraviolet `` green valley '' population . </S>",

    "<S> we show that 85 per cent of the global sfr is quiescent star formation within spiral disks , as manifest by the observed sequence in the @xmath5)(@xmath6 ) plane  the irx-@xmath7 relation  being significantly offset from the starburst relation of kong et al . </S>",

    "<S> just 15 per cent of the global sfr is due to nuclear starbursts . </S>",
