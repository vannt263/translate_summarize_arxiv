    "a radial excitation therefore shows that there are axial excitations , e.g. due to a lack of adiabaticity during the loading procedure . on the other hand , a lack of radial excitations is not strictly a proof that there are no axial excitations , since the radial heating is caused by _",

    "a non - zero value of @xmath25 indicates the occupation of neighbouring states . on the other hand",
    ", we can check for the coherence properties of such states by studying the effect of introducing a phase twist over an extension @xmath113 between them .",
    "if the two states are independent , the phase twist will not modify the energy of the system , while the contrary happens if they are coherent .",

    "the technique consists of suddenly releasing the axial harmonic confinement , while keeping both the quasi - periodic lattice potential and the radial confinement , and then observing the subsequent diffusion ( or lack thereof ) of the atomic cloud in the axial direction . in the previous experiment we observed that for vanishing @xmath9 the diffusion becomes strongly suppressed for @xmath121 .",
    "we have now observed that it continues to be suppressed for @xmath122 also for the values of @xmath9 explored in the present work , irrespective of whether the system is in the ag , fbec or bec regimes .",
    "we can interpret the absence of diffusion in the ag ( fbec ) regime as a result of the insulating nature of the system , which occupies ( partially ) localized states .",
    "in contrast , in the extended bec regime , a slow subdiffusive expansion is expected@xcite , or the expansion might be completely suppressed for some values of the parameters by self - trapping@xcite .",
    "the slow expansion however would probably not be detectable on the one second timescale of the experiments we have performed so far .",
    "the absence of a different diffusion behaviour of the system in the ag , fbec and bec regimes unfortunately does not allow us to identify the boundary between the fbec and bec regimes using this technique , nor to unambiguously prove the insulating nature of the ag and fbec regimes .",

    "<S> in the tight - binding limit , the hopping energy @xmath5 and disorder strength @xmath6 can be estimated as @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental uncertainty on @xmath13 is around 15% . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that around 30 lattice sites , corresponding to about 7 localized states , are populated during the loading of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we then define a mean interaction energy per particle @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a gaussian approximation to the on - site wannier function . </S>",
    "<S> we include coupling into the radial directions of our system , with the consequence that the interaction energy is non - linear in the scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> though this definition of the energy is strictly valid only in the localized regime , comparison with a numerical simulation of our experimental procedure has shown that it is a good approximation for all values of the scattering length up to an error of 30% . </S>",
    "<S> note that the potential energy from the residual harmonic confinement is approximately @xmath45 over a distance @xmath15 .      </S>",
    "<S> the images of the momentum distribution are taken by absorption imaging with a ccd camera after 36.5  ms ballistic expansion . at the time of release , </S>",
    "<S> the scattering length is set to below @xmath46 in less than one ms and kept there until the feshbach magnetic field is switched off 10  ms before taking the image  at this point , the system has expanded a sufficient amount to minimize the effect of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for such a free expansion , the image is approximately the in - trap momentum distribution @xmath47 ( ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the acquired images are integrated along the radial direction to obtain a profile . in momentum space , </S>",
    "<S> the width of the central peak is calculated by taking the root mean square width within the first brillouin zone . due to the quasi - periodic lattice potential , for a sufficiently homogeneous system the in - trap wavefunction </S>",
    "<S> can be decomposed into copies of a single state with real and non - negative envelope @xmath48 , spaced by @xmath15 . therefore in momentum space , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an interference term , and @xmath51 can be extracted from a fourier transform of @xmath52 ( see also supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we fit to the sum of two generalized exponential functions @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath54 denotes the centers of each of these functions , spaced by @xmath15 . from this fit , </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath16 is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from the wiener - khinchin theorem , the momentum distribution can be expressed in terms of the first order correlation function @xmath55 as @xmath56 . by taking the fourier transform of the momentum distribution itself </S>",
    "<S> , we can therefore recover the spatially averaged correlation function @xmath57 . with the same fitting function as above </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the spatially averaged correlation between two states 4.4 lattice sites apart , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the correlation function saturates at a value around 0.5 due to the finite momentum resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations in phase between neighbouring states are seen as a fluctuation of the phase @xmath22 of the interference pattern of the momentum distribution , which is directly extracted from a fit ( see also supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d graphs in figs  3 and 4 were generated by linearly interpolating a total of 130 averaged datapoints at 9 different values of disorder , changing the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> typical experimental scatter and statistical errors are seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c .      </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical calculations presented in the paper rely on a meanfield approach similar to the one of ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> this is an effective one - dimensional model which partially includes also the radial to axial coupling , and is known to provide an accurate description in the two limiting cases of anderson localization and bec . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries between the different regimes shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b are obtained by analyzing the correlation function @xmath20 and the density distribution . in the theory </S>",
    "<S> we define the anderson glass phase as the one in which the correlation @xmath25 is zero . to enter the fragmented bec ( fbec ) phase , we require @xmath59 , which implies that coherent fragments composed of adjacent localized states can start to form . for increasing @xmath9 the extension of the fragments increases , until most of the system remains in a single component , which corresponds to a macroscopic bec . to define the boundary between the fbec and the bec regimes , we first identify as fragments the parts of the system separated by low - density regions for which an applied relative phase twist does not affect the energy of the system . when one single macroscopic fragment forms , we assume the system to be in the bec regime . a more detailed description of the theoretical methods can be found in the supplementary information .    </S>",
