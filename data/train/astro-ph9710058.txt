    "sunyaev and zeldovich ( 1972 , 1980 ) showed that the passage of the photons of the cmb through clusters of galaxies distorts the spectrum of this radiation via the inverse compton interaction .",
    "this distortion can be described by a change of the brightness temperature @xmath3 of the cmb .",
    "this is known as the so - called sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "it can be used as an important cosmological probe ( e.g.  determination of the hubble constant @xmath4 ) . for",
    "a recent review of the sz effect see rephaeli ( 1995 ) .",
    "the strength of the sz effect is determined by the properties of the intracluster electron distribution .",
    "this distribution is also the source of the x - ray emission of clusters of galaxies . with an analysis of this x - rays we are able to obtain the required electron parameters . to describe the distribution of the intracluster electrons",
    "we assume the well - known isothermal @xmath5-model , where the temperature of the electrons is taken as constant over the whole cluster and the density distribution is described by a king profile .",
    "moreover , we assume only nonrelativistic electron temperatures .",
    "we analyze the x - ray emission of the two abell clusters a85 and",
    "a665 , and of the cluster 0016 + 16 . the relevant observations were made in 1991 and 1992 by the rosat pspc detector . for the x - ray analysis",
    "we apply the method described in uyaniker et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in the figures we only display the results for the best candidate ; all results can be found in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the x - ray map of cl0016 + 16 is shown in fig .",
    "the contours are very symmetrically , the strong point source to the north is the quasar qso  0015 + 162 ( see margon et al .  1983 ) .    in the next step",
    "we plot an azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile , and obtain the spatial parameters of the electron distribution with the best fit for the king profile on the data .",
    "we determine the so - called core radius @xmath6 , that describes the width of the distribution and the slope parameter @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the radial profile of cl0016 + 16 with the best fit can be seen .",
    "for a85 we find evidence for the presence of a cooling flow . here",
    "our model is insufficient : in a cooling flow cluster the temperature of the electrons is not constant . for future work on this cluster a different model",
    "is required .      for the analysis of spectral properties we use the theoretical model spectrum of the raymond - smith code .",
    "so we obtain the gas temperature @xmath7 for the clusters ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . due to the moderate energy resolution of rosat",
    "the errors in the temperatures are large .",
    "together with the small photon statistic for the cl0016 + 16 observation we obtain a 90% confidence error of about 37% . as described in uyaniker et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we calculate the luminosity distance @xmath8 , the linear extension of the core radius and the central electron density @xmath9 .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we summarize all obtained parameters with their 90% confidence errors .",
    "we do not display the values for a85 , since in that case the used model is inappropriate .",

    "the change of the brightness temperature @xmath12 towards clusters of galaxies at radio wavelength can be calculated as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the comptonization parameter and @xmath15 the pressure of the intracluster electron cloud . with the isothermal @xmath5-model for the electron distribution the integration along the line of sight @xmath16 yields for the brightness temperature    @xmath17^{-\\frac{3 \\beta}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    with @xmath18    to calculate the expected temperature distribution we use the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath9 , @xmath20 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 obtained from the x - ray analysis . for the integrated comptonization parameter @xmath21",
