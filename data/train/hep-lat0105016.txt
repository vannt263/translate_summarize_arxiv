    "from its inception , lattice gauge theory was hampered by the absence of an adequate fermion formulation .",
    "it was thought for many years that there is no discretization scheme that displays explicit chiral symmetry without either sacrificing locality or introducing non - physical doublers in the fermion spectrum .",
    "this state of affairs was summarized in the famous no - go theorem of nielsen and ninomiya  @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen major progress in the construction of lattice regularizations of fermions with good chiral properties  @xcite .",
    "domain wall  @xcite and overlap  @xcite formulations preserve chiral symmetry exactly , allowing the construction of vector gauge theories on the lattice .",
    "an idea common to these schemes is that of employing a large number of fermion flavors , one of which survives in the continuum limit as a massless fermion supporting exact chiral symmetry .    in the domain wall formulation ,",
    "the expanded flavor space may be seen as an extra dimension with a defect in a background field .",
    "one chirality of the dirac spinor is exponentially localized along the defect . if the extra dimension is periodic and of finite extent @xmath1 , the other chirality will be localized along an unavoidable second defect , while all the other dirac fermions , @xmath2 in number , stay heavy .",
    "this is also the scheme in shamir s surface - fermion variant  @xcite , which we study in this paper ; here the chiral modes are localized on the surfaces of a five - dimensional slab . in either case",
    ", the limit @xmath3 requires that the contribution of the heavy flavors be subtracted  @xcite by introducing @xmath1 flavors of pseudofermion fields , often called pauli - villars ( pv ) fields .",
    "these are bosons that have the same index structure as the fermions .",
    "domain wall fermions are equivalent to overlap fermions  @xcite in the limit that the size and lattice spacing of the fifth dimension are taken to infinity and zero , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the bulk degrees of freedom remain massive .",
    "they decouple as the four - dimensional lattice is removed , leaving a four - dimensional dirac operator describing the chiral surface modes .    in this paper",
    "we study domain wall fermions in the limit of strong gauge coupling .",
    "we adapt the classic method of kawamoto and smit  @xcite to derive an effective action for mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "a novel ingredient of the domain wall formalism is the pv bosons .",
    "we combine the fermions and pseudofermions into a supervector , and similarly group the effective degrees of freedom into a supermatrix",
    ". then the formalism of supergroups allows us easily to extend the treatment of the fermions to an analysis of the complete theory .",
    "the effective action contains all the meson - like states that can be constructed from pairs of fermions , from pairs of bosons , and from boson - fermion pairs .",
    "the interesting question is , does this theory really behave as one would expect of a theory of exactly chiral quarks ? to address this , we take the number of colors @xmath0 to infinity and look for saddle points of the effective action . following kawamoto and smit",
    ", we begin by setting the wilson parameter @xmath4 to zero and classifying the symmetries of the theory ; we display explicitly the goldstone bosons that are the fluctuations around the saddle point .",
    "the spectrum of goldstone bosons is characteristic of a theory with complete fermion doubling , which is not surprising since it is the term proportional to @xmath4 in the fermion action that breaks naive doubling in the first place .",
    "when we proceed , however , to perturb the saddle point with the @xmath4 terms , we find that the doubling persists and that the only effect of the perturbation is identical to that of adding a mass term ( _  la _",
    "shamir  @xcite ) to the domain wall action .",
    "we conclude that in the strong coupling limit , domain wall fermions are doubled and massive , with all that that implies for the mesonic spectrum .",
    "we thus confirm the conclusion reached by two of us  @xcite through study of the hamiltonian of domain wall fermions at strong coupling .",
    "unfortunately , our analysis here is more involved and perhaps less conclusive .",
    "study of the hamiltonian via rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory is straightforward and leads unambiguously to an effective hamiltonian for mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the symmetries of this effective theory are readily apparent . in the euclidean formulation",
    "some additional approximation is necessary , such as a hopping parameter expansion , mean field theory , or the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "expansion has been used in  @xcite . ]",
    "even at large @xmath0 , one might argue that there exists another saddle point with different symmetry properties .",
    "nonetheless , the euclidean study complements the hamiltonian results in that it does not require a time - continuum limit and thus does not introduce a new question regarding the order of limits .",
    "@xcite , but not in the euclidean calculation . to our knowledge ,",
    "there is no established correspondence between the perturbation series in the two formalisms . ]    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we derive the strong - coupling effective action . for pedagogic reasons ,",
    "we begin by ignoring the pv bosons .",
    "following kawamoto and smit  @xcite , we integrate out the gauge field in this limit and rewrite the resulting path integral in terms of a bosonic matrix field . that this path integral generates the same green functions as the original grassmann integral is due to an equality between generating functions that was proven in @xcite ( following @xcite ) .",
    "this path integral contains the effective action .",
    "while its derivation does not depend on a large-@xmath0 limit , we give its explicit form for this case only . in the last part of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we repeat the derivation with the bosons included .",
    "this requires a generalization to supermatrices of the identity relating generating functions , which we prove in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "since the chiral symmetry of the domain wall action arises dynamically , it is difficult to analyze the symmetry of the effective action directly . the symmetry analysis can not be divorced from the dynamics .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to deriving the symmetry breaking pattern of the theory and the spectrum of goldstone bosons .",
    "we can only make analytic progress in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "here the task at hand is to find saddle points of the effective action .",
    "again we start with an analysis of the theory without the pv bosons .",
    "we begin by setting @xmath4 to zero which makes finding a saddle point straightforward . in this limit",
    "the symmetry of the effective action is apparent ; upon introducing an _ ansatz _ for the saddle point we display the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the concomitant goldstone bosons .",
    "then we turn on the wilson term in the action and we compute its effect on the saddle point .",
    "it turns out that the degeneracy of the @xmath6 saddle point is broken by the @xmath4 term , but only in the way that a mass term breaks it , that is , by breaking chiral symmetry while leaving the doubling .",
    "we show explicitly that inclusion of the shamir mass term does the same .",
    "the extension of the calculation to include the pv bosons is straightforward .",
    "the saddle point in the enlarged field space is the obvious extension of the saddle point found above .",
    "perturbing the saddle point with the wilson term of the bosonic fields gives a mass matrix for the pseudo - goldstone bosons that is identical in form to that due to the massive fermions .",
    "we conclude with some discussion and comparison to other work .",
    "we define domain wall fermions on a five - dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "the fifth dimension has finite extent @xmath1 ; for generality we assign a lattice spacing @xmath7 to the four dimensions of euclidean space - time and a separate lattice spacing @xmath8 to the fifth dimension .",

    "one might have expected that the well - known cancellation between the fermions and the pauli - villars bosons affects the low - energy sector , but this does not occur .",
    "nonetheless , the heavy superpartners of the mesonic bound states must play an essential role in canceling the infinite number of heavy modes , thus allowing the above truncation to a low - energy effective theory .",
    "in this paper we have argued that , at strong coupling , non - abelian gauge theory with domain wall fermions exhibits explicit chiral symmetry breaking but with an enlarged spectrum of pseudo - goldstone modes characteristic of the doubling phenomenon .",
    "we derived the effective action of domain wall fermions at the leading order of the strong coupling and large-@xmath0 expansions in the limit that the lattice spacing of the fifth dimension goes to zero and its extent to infinity ; therefore our conclusions apply also to overlap fermions .",
    "our results also depend on perturbing to lowest order in the wilson @xmath4 parameter in the neighborhood of a stationary point with maximal symmetry consistent with @xmath193 .",
    "another phase , with different symmetry , might be encountered at finite @xmath4 .",
    "we consider it unlikely that moving to a saddle point with lower symmetry will restore any symmetry broken at this most symmetric saddle point",
    ". thus it would be surprising if chiral symmetry is restored at the true @xmath139 saddle point .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath112 symmetry characteristic of exact doubling could end up broken ; likewise , corrections of higher order in @xmath194 might break this symmetry .",
    "we do not know of another signal of doubling that could then be sought in the meson spectrum .",
    "our analytic results provide evidence for a phase transition from a weak coupling phase with good chiral properties to a strong coupling phase where the desired chiral properties are lost .",
    "this is based on the observation that to lowest order in @xmath4 there is an explicit breaking term identical in form to the quark mass term introduced by shamir .",
    "thus the true goldstone modes are lost . in the monte carlo simulations of domain wall fermions ,",
    "a pattern of increasing violation of chiral symmetry has been observed as the coupling is made stronger .",
    "the violations of chiral symmetry are suppressed exponentially in @xmath1 and therefore increasing the coupling requires increasing @xmath1 and consequently the computational burden .",
    "our calculation , however , has been done in the @xmath105 limit so we should not be seeing this problem . in this limit ,",
    "domain wall fermions are equivalent to overlap fermions .",
    "the locality of the ( effective ) 4d dirac operator is only guaranteed  @xcite at moderate couplings and therefore the bad chiral properties at strong coupling might be connected with the fact the theory is no longer local .",
    "since the induced breaking of chiral symmetry is identical in form to that caused by a shamir mass term , it is tempting to consider tuning the latter to cancel the former .",
    "this has been considered , in the context of finite-@xmath1 effects , by the authors of @xcite .",
    "one is reminded of wilson fermions , where the pions may be made massless by tuning the hopping parameter .",
    "wilson fermions do _ not _ regain chiral symmetry by this procedure , except in the continuum limit ; the masslessness of the pion stems from the proximity of a phase where parity and flavor symmetry are spontaneously broken @xcite",
    ". if the analogy is exact , then tuning @xmath195 to make the goldstone bosons massless will not restore chiral symmetry in the lattice domain - wall theory .",
    "neither would it restore locality to the effective overlap operator .",
    "recently , overlap fermions have been studied with a hopping parameter expansion , valid for large values of @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "our coefficients @xmath197 and @xmath198 vanish in the limit @xmath199 , so that chiral symmetry is apparently restored and our results are consistent with those of @xcite .",

    "unbroken for sufficiently large ( not necessarily infinite ) values of @xmath196 .",
    "thus there should be at least @xmath200 goldstone bosons , including a @xmath201 pseudoscalar .",
    "our results , while in agreement with the earlier hamiltonian study @xcite , stand in contradiction with those of @xcite in the common region of applicability , namely , large @xmath202 and @xmath196 .",
    "we can only conjecture some subtlety in taking the double limit @xmath203 .",
    "our strong coupling results rest on the analysis of a chiral @xmath204 super matrix model on a 4d lattice .",
    "an external field is provided by the hamiltonian in the fifth dimension .",
    "such matrix models are very interesting but notoriously hard to analyze .",
    "this supermatrix model reformulation of domain wall fermions is not peculiar to strong coupling . at any coupling , after integrating out the gauge fields , @xmath205 yang - mills theory with domain wall fermions must take the form of an effective theory , @xmath206,\\ ] ] expressed in terms of meson - like superfields .",
    "this is the ineluctible consequence of local 4d gauge invariance .",
    "the effective theory contains all the mesonic bound states@xmath207 spin - flavors of quark - antiquark pairs , a like number of pseudoquark - antipseudoquark pairs , and their superpartners .",
    "the physically interesting limit is @xmath208 , an infinite number of `` flavors . ''",
    "changing from @xmath205 to @xmath16 will introduce baryon - like superfields but these are most likely irrelevant to the low energy chiral phase structure . with this",
    "_ caveat _ , the only difference between strong coupling and general coupling is that now the 4d action , @xmath209 , is no longer restricted to nearest - neighbor couplings , becoming more and more non - local as we approach weak coupling .",
    "we expect this exact representation for @xmath205 domain wall lattice qcd to be in the correct chiral phase at weak enough coupling .",
    "the central question of this paper , whether the correct chiral symmetry pattern persists at strong coupling , is a question concerning the role of the non - locality for a @xmath210 4d supermatrix model in an external field at large @xmath211 .",
