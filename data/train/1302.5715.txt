    "we take the observation that two of the three giant flares from the sgrs were preceded by a precursor that was similar in energy ( @xmath0 ) to a typical short sgr burst ( ibrahim et al . 2001 ; hurley et al . 2005 ) as a hint that the precursor `` lights the fuse '' for the giant flare .",
    "the natural timescale for this fuse is the alfvn time of the inner magnetosphere , which for exceptionally low values of the plasma beta parameter is very small ; @xmath1s .",
    "although this is close to the rise time of the flare , this timescale is up to six orders of magnitude shorter than the delay between the precursor and the flare . of course , the symmetries of the magnetic field coupled to the plasma prevent the quasi - steady - state configuration to change this quickly unless the gradient of the magnetic field are large .",
    "so , the questions are how does the field develop large gradients and can this happen on the timescale of the delay between the precursors and the giant flares .    figure  [ fig : nsfig ] outlines a scenario where the initial sgr flare which is associated with a crustal shift injects a twist in the magnetosphere ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "this causes the external magnetic field lines to form a configuration allowing the formation of a current sheet where the field lines can reconnect and release a large amount of magnetic energy ( see for e.g. lyutikov 2006 ) .",
    "this reconnection will proceed slowly over a resistive timescale .",
    "the standard picture for this process is the sweet - parker layer denoted in figure  [ fig : nsfig ] and placed into focus in the left panel of figure  [ fig : current_layers ] .",
    "we assume that the plasma is incompressible and that the magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy . combining these assumptions with the geometry",
    "then yields a relationship between the alfvnic mach number of the reconnecting flow and the resistivity through the lundquist number , @xmath2 because the spitzer resistivity of the collisionless plasma at temperatures @xmath3 is small , this mach number is small , and the reconnection timescale is large unless some sort of anomalous resistivity is present .",
    "we will use the super - hot turbulent current layer ( shtcl ) model to introduce a source of anomalous resistivity ( somov 2006 ) . again making the same assumptions as with the sweet - parker layer but with the modified geometry of the right panel of figure  [ fig : current_layers ]",
    ", we obtain the reconnection velocity of @xmath4 which now depends on geometric considerations rather than the spitzer resistivity of the plasma .",
    "what length scales do we have ?",
    "from biggest to smallest , we have the layer width ( @xmath5 ) , the layer funnel width ( @xmath6 ) , the layer thickness ( @xmath7 ) , the proton cyclotron radius , and the electron cyclotron radius .",
    "cassak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that the sweet - parker layer can be thinned down to proton cyclotron lengthscale by convecting strong fields into the current layer .",
    "we find the critical field strength for this to occur @xmath8 . with the presence of baryons the thinned current layer undergoes hall reconnection which proceeds on an alfvnic timescale , hundreds of microseconds typically .",
    "thus , the delay between the precursor to the flare is the timescale to thin from the initial reconnection region ( this determines the total energy of the flare ) to the proton cyclotron radius .",
    "the thin shtcl provides anomalous resistivity that allows the current layer to thin on a timescale comparable to the delay for the december 27 event @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic field shear length , @xmath11 is the length of the current sheet , @xmath12 we have used the data for the december 27 event .",
    "the august 27 flare had a short and weak precursor , yielding about one percent of the baryons .",
    "furthermore , the flare was weaker too , requiring a smaller reconnection region .",
    "we get @xmath13 similar to the delay for the august 27 event .",
    "future giant flares from sgrs will improve our understanding of such correlations as well as the mechanism for the triggering of giant flares from soft - gamma repeaters .",
