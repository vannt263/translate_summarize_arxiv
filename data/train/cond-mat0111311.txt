    "the presence of adhesive forces between grains can greatly alter the physical behavior of sandpiles@xcite .",
    "although the importance of intergrain adhesion has been noted in many fields , ranging from soil science to civil engineering , the understanding of the physical principles governing the link between the macroscopic behavior of sandpiles in which adhesion is present and the microscopic attractive force distribution within the sandpile remains limited .",
    "some light has been shed on this subject recently through experimental and theoretical studies which have shown that small quantities of liquid added to a sandpile comprised of rough spherical grains can cause sufficient intergrain adhesion so that the angle of repose after failure @xcite and also the maximum static angle of stability of the sandpile before failure @xcite , known as the critical angle , @xmath0 , greatly increase . a continuum theory that links stress criteria for the macroscopic failure of the wet pile to the cohesion between grains , which in turn was attributed to the formation of liquid menisci with radii of curvature that were determined by the surface roughness characteristics of individual grains ,",
    "has provided a satisfying quantitative explanation of the increase of @xmath0 with the liquid volume fraction and air - liquid interfacial tension @xcite .    in this theory , each intergrain meniscus",
    "is assumed to exert the same average attractive force everywhere in the pile .",
    "this assumption appears to be valid for sufficiently wet sandpiles ; however , when the volume of the wetting fluid is small enough this theory is incapable of explaining the data .",
    "there are two principal features of the small  fluid  volume data that are incompatible with the continuum theory@xcite .",
    "the first is that the increase in @xmath0 with small amounts of wetting fluid is independent of the surface tension of that fluid@xcite .",
    "the second is that , in order to quantitatively fit the data , one must assume that a small fraction of the wetting fluid is sequestered on the grains in such a way that it does not participate in the formation of inter - grain menisci that contribute to the adhesive stresses within the pile .",
    "it is possible that , at vanishingly small fluid coverage , the physical / chemical inhomogeneities of the grains surface prevents the transport of the wetting fluid from one mensicus to another thereby allowing a wide distribution of inter - grain cohesive forces . to begin to understand the effect of such a broad distribution of inter - grain forces upon the macroscopic properties of the sandpile",
    ", we consider in this paper an extreme example of such a distribution in which some inter - grain contacts have an arbitrarily large cohesion while others have no cohesion at all .",
    "consistent with the notion that the non - uniform distribution of inter - grain cohesion is primarily significant at low fluid volumes , we study a system designed so that each grain has at most one strong cohesive contract .    in order to begin to investigate how nonuniform distributions of microscopic attractive forces between grains can affect the overall macroscopic stability of sandpiles , we have measured maximum stability angles of dry sandpiles made by mixing a weight fraction @xmath3 of dimer grains ( two spherical grains rigidly bonded together ) into spherical monomer grains . the measured @xmath4 gradually increases over the entire range of @xmath5 , despite a moderate drop in the total packing fraction of grains , @xmath2 , within the pile , due to the more inefficient packing of the dimers",
    ".    a detailed theoretical study of the failure mechanism of such piles leads us to the following key observations and conclusions , which enable us to quantitatively account for the increase in @xmath4 :    \\(i ) for piles consisting of perfectly rough particles ( large intergrain friction ) , the stability of the free surface upon tilting is limited by the particles on the surface layer , which fail by rolling out of the surface traps they sit in .",
    "\\(ii ) for a given surface trap geometry , dimer particles typically remain stable up to larger tilt angles ; thus , for a mixture of monomers and dimers , pile stability is limited by the monomers on the surface , provided that the dimer concentration is not too large .",
    "\\(iii ) provided that individual grains rolling out of unstable traps do not initiate avalanches , the pile will remain stable as long as the density of _ stable _ surface traps is larger than the density of monomers on the surface layer .",
    "\\(iv ) the ratio of the density of monomers on the surface layer to the total density of surface traps is @xmath6 .",
    "\\(v ) a statistical characterization of the particle - scale roughness of the surface associated with grain packing is necessary to determine @xmath0 quantitatively .",
    "the stability criteria for a pile consisting of a mixture of monomers and dimers with ideally rough surfaces can be cast as a purely geometrical problem under conditions where rolling - initiated surface failure is the primary mechanism that limits the stability of the pile . in this picture ,",
    "monomers and dimers on the surface layer occupy surface traps formed by the particles underneath , each of which have a different stability criterion associated with the trap s shape and orientation with respect to the average surface normal and the downhill direction . for a pile to be stable at a given tilt angle , all the grains on the surface have to be sitting in a stable surface trap , suggesting that the least stable surface traps would control the overall stability of the pile .    for a pile consisting of monomers ,",
    "there are actually twice as many surface traps as surface grains , and upon very gradually increasing the average tilt of the pile without disturbing the underlying grains , one finds that surface grains in traps that become unstable upon tilting can briefly roll down the pile s surface until they encounter an unoccupied stable surface trap which ends their descent , provided that at least half the surface traps remain stable so that all surface grains can be accomodated . a detailed analysis in sec .",
    "[ seccps ] shows that it is much easier to trap dimers than monomers on a perfectly ordered close packed surface of spheres .",
    "this suggests that the stability of a random mixed pile of monomer and dimers is actually limited by the monomers on the surface , which accumulate in the most stable surface traps as @xmath0 is approached .",
    "if one assumes that the dimers remain essentially stable , one might expect that only a fraction @xmath6 of the surface traps remain stable when the pile is tilted to its maximum stability angle @xmath7 ; at this angle , there are just enough to accomodate all the monomers on the surface layer . a detailed experimental characterization of the positions of surface grains of random monomer and dimer piles in sec .  [ secanalysis ] , combined with the computed stability criteria for monomers and dimers occupying surface traps in sec .",
    "[ secstability ] , provide a quantitative explanation of the measured increase in @xmath7 with no adjustable parameters up to @xmath8 , where the assumption of monomer failure begins to break down .",
    "this good agreement over a wide range of @xmath9 reflects the subtle interplay between the distribution of orientational and size fluctuations of the surface traps , some of which are stabilizing and some destabilizing .",
    "thus , accurate characterization of  grain - scale \" roughness ( as distinct from the microscopic surface roughness of the grains ) is essential to achieve quantitative agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the important role played by grain - scale roughness is also evident in the rheology of gravity - driven chute flows@xcite , where the precise nature of the bottom surface has significant influence on the resulting flow .",
    "nevertheless , the results convincingly demonstrate that the stability of cohesionless grains with large inter - grain friction is indeed controlled by surface failure , and should otherwise be insensitive to the type of grain material .",
    "in addition to clarifying the role of surface failure in the stability of piles by connecting macroscopic measurements of stability angle to grain - scale composition , these results for a well - characterized sandpile also provide a critical link between the attractive forces within the sandpile and the nonspherical geometry of a well - known fraction of constituent grains . in this respect , these measurements provide quantitative insight into similar measurements of the angle of repose after dynamic failure of less well - controlled piles of spheres and cylinders ( e.g. peas and rice ) . from this perspective",
    ", dimers may be imagined as short elongated grains that have surface irregularities of the same order as the grain size .",
    "these irregularities promote the strong interlocking of adjacent grains , which inhibits the failure of the pile more than the typical contacts between smooth cylinders and ellipsoids .",

    "we prepare the dimer grains by bonding glass spheres of radius @xmath10 mm and density @xmath11 g/@xmath12 together using methyl acrylate glue .",
    "the glue in its carrier solvent completely coats the surfaces of the glass spheres and accumulates in a contact meniscus between the spheres . after less than one day of drying",
    ", a strong shear - rigid bond between the spheres is formed .",
    "the volume of the dried glue is much smaller than the volume of the spheres , so the two bonded grains have the appearance of an ideal dimer or doublet . because the glue coats the entire surfaces of the grains and may thus alter the friction coefficient of the grains , we have likewise coated all the monomer grains with methyl acrylate so that the friction coefficient at the contact points between grains , whether monomers or dimers , is identical .",
    "the sandpiles are prepared by mixing together varying weight fractions @xmath3 of dimer grains into monomers , as determined by a balance .",
    "the mixtures are placed in a clear plastic box having a square bottom that is 6.5 cm wide and a height of 5.5 cm , yielding an average number of spheres per pile of about three hundred .    to measure the critical angle",

    "we tilt the box at an angle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpile](a ) , and shake it back and forth about five times along the direction of the lower edge ( normal to the page in the figure ) .",
    "this distributes the grains so that the surface of the pile is normal to the direction of gravity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpile](b ) .",
    "there is no noticeable size segregation of the grains introduced by the shaking .",
    "we have purposefully avoided tapping the pile in order to prevent a densification that could affect the pile s surface characteristics and stability@xcite .",
    "we then place the lower edge of the box on a table and slowly tilt it so that the bottom rests flat on the table and normal to the direction of gravity .",
    "if the pile fails catastrophically , then no measurement is recorded , but if the pile remains stable after only isolated movement and resettling of a few grains , then a measurement of the static angle of the pile , @xmath13 , is recorded , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpile](c ) .",
    "after several trials , a rough determination of the stable angle is obtained , and thereafter the initial angles are not chosen randomly , but instead are kept close to this value . using the results of ten trials , we average the values of the three largest angles to obtain the critical angle , @xmath0 .",
    "this value of the critical angle is reproducible ; the variation in the three angles used to obtain the average is about ten percent for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "this procedure yields slightly larger angles than those found in typical angle of repose measurements in which the sandpile is induced to fail .",
    "figure [ figthetac ] depicts @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we find that it increases approximately linearly , from @xmath14 , a well established value for a wide variety of dry spherical grains@xcite , to @xmath15 for a sandpile comprised completely of dimers .",
    "we have also measured the average packing volume fraction of grains , @xmath2 , in the sandpile as a function of @xmath3 by measuring the mass of water required to fill the voids in the pile as it stands in the tilted configuration shown in fig .",

    "[ figdens ] . the overall reduction in the packing fraction of about ten percent indicates that dimer grains pack less efficiently than monomer grains .    in order to experimentally characterize the surfaces of random piles of either monomer or dimer grains , we have taken stereo digital images of stable piles using top and front views in order to reconstruct the three - dimensional coordinates of the centers of all of the spheres visible on the surfaces of the piles",
    "we do not include spheres that touch walls or the bottom surface of the container .",
    "due to the significant surface roughness of the piles , especially in the case of the dimer pile , we occasionally detect the position of a sphere that lies more than one diameter below the average surface defined by all the grains .",

    ", the shape of particles in a pile has a large influence on @xmath19 and the slightly larger critical angle @xmath0@xcite .",
    "furthermore , our granular dynamics simulations of piles , made of spheres with hertzian contacts and static friction , show that @xmath19 initially increases rapidly with increasing friction coefficient @xmath21 , although it saturates at a value of about @xmath22 for @xmath23 ( see fig .  [ figthetavsmu ] ) .",
    "these observations suggest a primarily geometrical origin for the robustness of @xmath0 for perfectly rough spheres ( @xmath24 ) , which can be further studied in an idealized system in which sliding is disallowed , due either to a very large friction coefficient or to interlocking surface irregularities .",
    "the spheres in such a static pile can be classified into two groups as follows : a surface layer that consists of spheres held in place by exactly three spheres and their own weight , and interior spheres that have more than three contacts .",
    "( we do not consider the small population of  rattler \" spheres with three contacts that might exist in the interior of the pile , which will presumably not influence the stability of the pile . ) the centers of the three spheres that support each sphere in the surface layer form the vertices of what we henceforth call the  base triangle \" associated with that sphere .",
    "as the tilt angle of the pile is increased , spheres on the surface layer can move by rolling out of the surface trap formed by the three supporting neighbors .",
    "however , interior particles ( excluding rattlers ) are held in place by a cage formed by their contacting neighbors , and if the friction coefficient is sufficiently large to preclude any sliding , they can not move until this cage is destroyed by the motion of at least one of their neighbors .",
    "this suggests that initiation of failure occurs at the surface layer , provided that sliding is disallowed .",
    "if the coefficient for rolling friction is small enough to be neglected , the stability of a sphere on the surface layer , and consequently the determination of @xmath0 , becomes a purely geometrical problem . for finite values of @xmath21",

    "nevertheless , their result is in good agreement with experiments .",
    "we will address the dependence of the stability of a surface trap on some of these additional parameters in more detail in section[secstability ] .",
    "there is , however , a more serious complication with the averaging approach than the neglect of fluctuation effects : the stability of the pile requires _ all _ particles on the surface to be stable . thus , the stability of the pile should be dictated by the particle in the _ least stable _ surface trap , and not an average stability criterion",
    "one might thus wonder why the averaging approach appears to work so well .",
    "in fact , for a pile of monomers , the number of base triangles forming potential surface traps is essentially twice the number of surface particles that actually reside in them .",
    "this is easy to see in the case of close - packed layers , where each successive layer to be placed on top has a choice among two sublattice positions ; this is what gives rise to random stacking .",
    "the relationship is actually more general .",
    "if the surface of a pile is sufficiently smooth such that an average surface normal vector to the pile can be determined ( note that this is a prerequisite to actually being able to define and measure @xmath0 ) , the base triangles associated with surface traps can be identified by a delaunay triangulation of the sphere centers at the surface layer , projected onto the plane of the mean pile surface . in such a triangulation ,",
    "the number of triangles per surface layer sphere is exactly two , since the sum of all the interior angles of the triangles is @xmath31(no .",

    "[ secanalysis ] .",
    "this ratio of surface trap to surface sphere density indicates that in a stable pile , only half of the traps are actually filled .",
    "the pile will then find a stable configuration as long as at least half of the surface traps are stable at the given tilt angle of the pile , since surface spheres that are in unfavorable traps can roll down the slope until they find a vacant trap of sufficient stability , assuming that they do not gain enough kinetic energy to knock other particles off their traps and cause an avalanche .",
    "continuous failure of surface spheres will occur if there are never enough traps to stabilize the entire layer .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the stability of the pile is actually determined by the _",

    "@xcite is small ; about 1.6 degrees .",
    "before launching a full - scale analysis of the pile stability problem for random piles having random surface grain configurations , it is instructive to consider the implications and power of this new approach to stability on a simplified system consisting of a mixture of spheres ( monomers ) and dimers sitting on a triangular close - packed lattice . the stability analysis leading to eq.([eqsphere ] ) can be extended to dimers .",
    "dimers sit in surface traps such that the vector connecting the centers of the two spheres forming the dimer are always parallel to one of the edges of the base triangles , thus their orientation with respect to the downhill direction can be described by the angle @xmath26 as well .",

    "[ figstab](a ) .",
    "it is striking how much more stable dimers are compared to spheres for certain orientations of the traps .",
    "this is due to the more favorable position of the center of mass of the dimer , located where the two spheres meet , which makes it more difficult to roll out of the surface traps .",
    "an alternate , and perhaps more vivid , way of seeing the relative stability of dimers with respect to monomers is to plot the fraction of stable traps @xmath35 at a given tilt angle @xmath13 : @xmath36    in the above , @xmath35 is defined in terms of the density of surface traps at a given stability angle , @xmath37 . for this particular case ,",

    "by introducing dimer grains in a sandpile comprised of rough spherical monomer grains , we have shown that the critical angle of the sandpile can be nearly doubled in the limit of high dimer content .",
    "qualitatively , this result is not so surprising , given the significant number of previous measurements of the angle of repose of mixtures of cylindrical or spheri - cylindrical grains with spherical grains that have also shown an increase .",
    "however , the use of dimers , rather than other elongated objects , permits the random surface of the pile to be described as a collection of spheres that form triangular surface traps .",
    "these triangles have a distribution of edge lengths and yaw , roll , and tilt angles that can be directly obtained through stereo imaging and can be included in a theory . by comparing the macroscopic average property of the pile , the critical angle , with the grain - scale structure on the pile s surface obtained through imaging , we are able to show which aspects of the surface structure are important for determining the value of the critical angle .    for instance , the treatment of the critical angle of a random pile that considers only the mean angle of stability for a grain on a close packed surface , averaged over the yaw angle , may give a value close to the measured @xmath0 , but is this just a fortuitous agreement ?",
    "our results show that , by averaging over realistic distributions of yaw and tilt , the more realistic median critical angle drops below the observed @xmath0 .",
    "however , because the pile is random , the intergrain separation has a distribution itself , and the average edge length of a triangular surface trap is slightly greater than the grain diameter .",
    "this increase in the edge length of the surface trap , as compared to a perfectly close packed surface , increases the stability of a sphere in the trap .",
    "indeed , we believe that it is the combination of the destabilizing influence of the roll distribution , along with the stabilizing influence of the larger edge length that gives the random pile of rough spherical grains its rather well - established value of @xmath74 .    these results for mixed monomer - dimer sandpiles shed some light on the observed initial increase in the critical angle of wet sandpiles , independent of container size and liquid surface tension , when liquid content is below a threshold value.@xcite",
    ". the initial linear increase in @xmath1 with @xmath3 may provide a plausible mechanism , in which the fraction of strongly wetted intergrain contacts increases gradually until all intergrain contacts are nearly uniformly wetted .",
    "provided that the formed bonds are strong enough and relatively dilute , the wet pile can be expected to respond similarly to a pile with a small fraction of dimers .",
    "one would expect that clusters with grains having more than one cohesive contact with neighboring grains would form in the wet sandpile as the threshold volume fraction is approached , and , above the threshold volume fraction , the picture of an average cohesive force holding grains together everywhere in the pile would become tenable . the data in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest an equivalent @xmath3 of about 0.12 at the threshold liquid volume fraction",
    ".    it may be possible to extend the presented work to systems involving trimers and higher order clusters of grains@xcite .",
    "however , such clusters can have many different shapes , and to simplify the theoretical treatment , it may be necessary to restrict allowed shapes to close - packed or linear structures . along a different direction , reducing the grain - grain friction coefficient @xmath21 will allow sliding failure modes and thereby lower the critical angle of the sandpile .",
    "densification of the pile through tapping might also change the angles of stability . finally , developing a theoretical understanding of the reduction of the grain packing fraction with increasing dimer content would help shed light on how strong intergrain attractive forces",

    "the base triangle can be fully specified by the positions of the two remaining vertices relative to the first one ; this leaves six parameters to be determined .",

    "the original base triangle can be reconstructed ( modulo translations ) as follows : place a triangle with given edge lengths in the @xmath76plane such that the shortest edge is parallel to the @xmath77axis and  downhill \" from the vertex across it , i.e. , the @xmath83ordinate of the vertex is larger . then , rotate the triangle around the @xmath79 axis by @xmath26 , @xmath83 axis by @xmath48 and finally , @xmath77axis by @xmath13 . with the proper labeling of vertices as described above",
