    "inverse spin galvanic effect ( isge ) , referring to the electrical or optical generation of a nonequilibrium spin density in non - centrosymmetric materials , has attracted much attention over the years.@xcite it originates from the momentum relaxation of carriers in an electrical field and their asymmetric redistribution in subbands that are spin - split by spin - orbit coupling.@xcite isge was first observed in bulk tellurium and soon generalized to low - dimensional structures such as gaas quantum wells.@xcite    from an applied perspective , in ferromagnets lacking inversion symmetry isge enables the electrical control of the local magnetization through angular momentum transfer , a mechanism called spin - orbit torque ( sot).@xcite this effect has been scrutinized in dilute magnetic semiconductors such as ferromagnetic bulk ( ga , mn)as @xcite and metallic multilayers comprising heavy metals and ferromagnets@xcite . these observations have been recently extended to bilayers involving topological insulators displaying extremely large sot efficiencies @xcite .",

    "the vector @xmath3 depends on the current direction * j * and the symmetries of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "for instance , in a ferromagnetic two - dimensional electron gas ( normal to @xmath4 ) with rashba spin - orbit coupling , @xmath5.@xcite an interesting aspect of the formula given above is that the antidamping - like torque arises from the distortion of the wavefunction induced by the electric field , a mechanism closely related to the material@xmath6s berry curvature @xcite .    in parallel to the development of sot in ferromagnetic structures , the study of spin - orbit coupled transport has also been extended to low - dimensional hexagonal crystals such as graphene .",

    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is attributed to the `` breathing '' fermi surface , i.e. ,  the distortion of the fermi surface , and the modification of the band filling as a function of the direction of the magnetization when the exchange is comparable to the rashba parameters .    in the absence of valley degeneracy ,",
    "the angular dependence at k and k points differ significantly from each other ( red and blue lines in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( a , b ) and ( d , e ) ] .",
    "in contrast , the antidamping - like component of the spin density , @xmath71 , displays a non - linear dependence as a function of the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling that is very different for the two valleys and highly sensitive to the staggered potential [ see figs .",

    "it illustrates the fact that while @xmath70 and @xmath71 both originate from interband transitions , only the latter is related to berry curvature , i.e. ,  the field - like sot is purely due to isge instead of the superposition of berry curvature and isge in ferromagnetic gamnas as pointed out by kurebayashi et al.@xcite",
    "to complete the present study , we computed the magnitude of antidamping - like and field - like components of the spin density and corresponding electrical efficiencies for various graphene - like honeycomb lattices , assuming @xmath73 ev and @xmath74 ev . the results are reported in table 1 , showing that the largest sot is obtained for stanene [ @xmath75 @xmath76 . as a comparison , the corresponding efficiencies of field - like sot in ( ga , mn)as@xcite , two - dimensional rashba systems@xcite and topological insulators@xcite are of the order of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath75 @xmath79 , respectively , in agreement with the orders of experimental results@xcite .",
    "therefore , for moderate rashba and exchange parameters , honeycomb lattices seem to display large field - like torques .",
    "interestingly , the antidamping - like torque remains about one order of magnitude smaller than the field - like torque , as already observed in two - dimensional rashba gases and ( ga , mn)as @xcite .

    "the voltage is applied to the sidearms and the current flows from the lower sidearm to the upper one . in the absence of magnetization , a valley hall effect may be detected in the two horizontal terminals.@xcite in the presence of magnetization , the torque exerted on the magnetization of the magnetic insulator deposited on top of the left or right terminal will be different .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the nature of sots in two dimensional hexagonal crystals and qualitatively recovered most of the results obtained on different systems such as ( ga , mn)as and two - dimensional rashba gases @xcite . we showed that the staggered potential and intrinsic spin - orbit coupling can strongly affect the magnitude of the torque components as well as their angular dependence . in the presence of",
    "staggered potential and exchange field , the valley degeneracy can be lifted and we obtain a valley - dependent antidamping sot , while the field - like component remains mostly unaffected .",
    "this feature is understood in terms of berry curvature and we show that the valley imbalance can be as high as 100% by tuning the bias voltage or magnetization angle .",
