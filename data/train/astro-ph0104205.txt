    "white dwarf stars are the end - points of stellar evolution for the majority of all stars , and their composition and structure can tell us about their prior history . compared to main - sequence stars , white dwarfs are relatively simple objects to model . once they pass through the hot planetary nebula nucleus phase , their evolution is a slow cooling process largely uncomplicated by nuclear burning or other poorly understood effects .",
    "nature has been kind by providing several varieties of otherwise normal white dwarf stars that undergo continuous and remarkably stable pulsations .",
    "we can determine the internal structure of these pulsating white dwarfs by observing their variations in brightness over time and then matching these observations with a computer model which behaves the same way .",
    "in the past decade , the observational aspects of white dwarf seismology have been addressed by the development of the whole earth telescope @xcite .",
    "this instrument is now mature , and has provided a wealth of seismological data on the different varieties of pulsating white dwarf stars . in an effort to bring the analytical treatment of these data to a comparable level of sophistication , we have recently developed an objective global optimization method for white dwarf pulsation models based on a genetic algorithm [ see  2 of @xcite and references therein for a detailed discussion of genetic algorithms ] .",
    "@xcite applied this new approach to observations of the helium - atmosphere variable white dwarf gd  358 , allowing the stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) , the effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) , and the mass of the surface helium layer ( @xmath4 ) to be free parameters .",
    "they repeated the procedure for several combinations of core composition and internal chemical profiles . among other things",
    ", this initial study demonstrated that the fits were significantly improved by searching globally with different core compositions .",
    "the obvious next step is to extend this method to treat the central oxygen abundance as a free parameter .",
    "this has the exciting potential to place meaningful constraints on the @xmath5c@xmath6o nuclear reaction cross - section .",
    "the value of the @xmath5c@xmath7o cross - section at stellar energies is presently the result of an extrapolation across eight orders of magnitude from laboratory data @xcite . during the final stages of a red giant star ,",
    "this reaction competes with the triple-@xmath8 process for the available @xmath8-particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the final ratio of carbon to oxygen in the core of a white dwarf is a measure of the relative rates of the two reactions @xcite .",
    "the triple-@xmath8 reaction is relatively well determined at the relevant energies , so the constraint that comes from this measurement is much more precise than other methods .",
    "the initial 3-parameter fits to gd  358 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mnw ) made it clear that both the central oxygen abundance and the shape of the internal chemical profile should be treated as free parameters .",
    "we modified our code to allow any central oxygen mass fraction ( @xmath9 ) between 0.00 and 1.00 with a resolution of 1 percent . to explore different chemical profiles we fixed @xmath9 to its central value out to a fractional mass parameter ( @xmath10 ) which varied between 0.10 and 0.85 with a resolution of 0.75 percent . from this point , we forced @xmath9 to decrease linearly in mass to zero oxygen at the 95 percent mass point .    this parameterization is a generalized form of the `` steep '' and `` shallow '' profiles used in @xcite .",
    "we originally used these profiles so that our results could be easily compared to earlier work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter authors define both profiles in their figure 1 .",
    "the `` shallow '' profile corresponds approximately to @xmath11 , and `` steep '' corresponds roughly to @xmath12 .",
    "however , in our generalized parameterization we have moved the point where the oxygen abundance goes to zero from a fractional mass of 0.9 out to a fractional mass of 0.95 .",
    "this coincides with the boundary in our models between the self - consistent core and the envelope , where we describe the he / c transition using a diffusion equilibrium profile from the method of @xcite with diffusion exponents of @xmath13 .",
    "we do not presently include oxygen in the envelopes , so the    [ tab1 ]    table 1    convergence of the method on synthetic data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -12pt    _ significant _ improvement to the fit , we use the bayes information criterion ( bic ) , following @xcite .",
    "the fit in mnw used @xmath14 completely free parameters , though they also sampled several combinations of two additional parameters .",
    "this amounts to a partial optimization in 5 dimensions . to make a fair prediction of the residuals required to be considered significant we use their best - fit carbon core model , which represents the best truly 3-parameter fit",
    "this model had rms residuals of @xmath15 seconds for the periods and @xmath16 seconds for the period spacings . for @xmath17 data points , the bic leads us to expect the residuals of a @xmath18 fit to decrease to @xmath19 and @xmath20 just from the addition of the extra parameters .",
    "in fact , the fit from the new forward modeling presented in  [ fwdsec ] has @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so we conclude that the improvement is statistically significant .",
    "the results of the reverse approach presented in  [ revsec ] are harder to evaluate because we are perturbing the bv frequency directly , rather than through a specific parameter .",
    "we consider each additional point in the internal chemical profile where the composition gradient changes to be a free parameter . under this definition ,",
    "the perturbed models are equivalent to a 7-parameter fit since there are three such points in the profiles , compared to only one for the 5-parameter case .",
    "if we again use the bic , we expect the residuals to decrease from their @xmath18 values to @xmath23 and @xmath24 seconds .",
    "after re - optimizing the other four parameters using the profile inferred from the reverse approach , the residuals actually decreased to @xmath25 and @xmath26 seconds .",
    "the decrease in the period residuals is not significant , but the period spacings are improved considerably .",
    "this is evident in the bottom panel of figure [ fig4 ] .    adopting the central oxygen mass fraction from the best - fit forward modeling , @xmath27 we can place preliminary constraints on the @xmath5c@xmath7o cross - section .",
    "@xcite made detailed evolutionary calculations for main - sequence stellar models with masses between 1 and 7 m@xmath28 to provide internal chemical profiles for the resulting white dwarfs .",
    "for the bulk of the calculations they adopted the rate of @xcite for the @xmath5c@xmath7o reaction ( @xmath29 kev barns ) , but they also computed an evolutionary sequence using the lower cross - section inferred by @xcite from solar abundances ( @xmath30 kev barns ) .",
    "the chemical profiles from both rates had the same general shape , but the oxygen abundances were uniformly smaller for the lower rate . in both cases",
    "the c / o ratio was constant out to the 50 percent mass point , a region easily probed by white dwarf pulsations .",
    "the central oxygen mass fraction is lower in higher mass white dwarf models .",
    "the rate of the triple-@xmath8 reaction ( a three - body process ) increases faster at higher densities than does the @xmath5c@xmath31o reaction . as a consequence",
    ", more helium is used up in the production of carbon , and relatively less is available to produce oxygen in higher mass models .",
    "interpolating between the models of @xcite which used the higher value of the cross - section , we expect a central oxygen mass fraction for a @xmath32 model of @xmath33 .",
    "using additional calculations for the low rate ( m.  salaris 2001 , private communication ) , the expected value is @xmath34 . extrapolating to the value inferred from our new forward modeling",
    ", we estimate that the astrophysical s - factor at 300 kev for the @xmath5c@xmath35o cross - section is in the range @xmath36 kev barns ( internal uncertainty only ) .",
    "the internal chemical profiles corresponding to the best - fit models from  [ fwdsec ] and  [ revsec ] are shown in figure [ fig5 ] with the theoretical profile for a 0.61 @xmath37 model from @xcite , scaled to a central oxygen mass fraction of 0.80 . the profile from the best - fit forward modeling matches the location and slope of the initial shallow decrease in the theoretical profile .",
    "the reverse approach also finds significant structure in this region of the model , and is qualitatively similar to the @xcite profile to the extent that our parameterization allows .",
    "the extension of the genetic - algorithm - based approach to optimize the internal composition and structure of our best - fit white dwarf models to gd  358 has yielded some exciting results .",
    "the values of the 3 parameters considered in the initial study ( @xmath38 ) are unchanged in the full 5-parameter fit , so we feel confident that they are the most important for matching the gross period structure .",
    "the significant improvement to the fit made possible by including @xmath39 and @xmath10 as free parameters confirms that the observed pulsations really do contain information about the hidden interiors of these stars .",
    "the efficiency of the ga relative to a grid search is much higher for the larger parameter - space , and the ability of the method to find the global best - fit is undiminished .",
    "the application of this method to data on additional pulsating white dwarfs will help us to assess the significance of our results , so we can begin to understand the statistical properties of these ubiquitous and relatively simple stellar objects .",
    "it may also provide us with      our reverse approach to model - fitting was originally motivated by the fact that the variance of our best - fit model from the forward method was still far larger than the observational uncertainties . although this initial application has demonstrated the clear potential of this approach to yield better fits to the data , the improvement to the residuals was only marginally significant .",
    "we will continue to develop this approach , but we must simultaneously work to improve the input physics of our models .",
    "in particular , since the internal profile from this initial application is qualitatively similar to the theoretical profiles ( given what is possible with this parameterization ) , we should really include oxygen in our envelopes and eventually calculate fully self - consistent models out to the surface .    turning the central oxygen abundance into a more precise constraint on",
    "the @xmath5c@xmath7o nuclear reaction cross - section will require additional detailed simulations like those of @xcite . by determining the range of values for the cross - section that produce a central oxygen abundance within the measurement uncertainties of @xmath40",
    ", we should be able to surpass the precision of the extrapolation from laboratory data by nearly an order of magnitude . to assess the systematic uncertainties",
    ", we will also need to determine the relative importance of model - dependent details such as convection .",
    "we would like to thank ed nather and mike montgomery for helpful discussions , and m.  salaris for providing us with data files of the theoretical white dwarf internal chemical profiles .",
    "we are grateful to the high altitude observatory visiting scientist program for fostering this collaboration in a very productive environment for two months during the summer of 2000 .",
    "this work was supported by grant nag5 - 9321 from the applied information systems research program of the national aeronautics & space administration , and in part by grant ast-9876730 from the national science foundation .      at first glance",
    ", it may seem that our parameterization of the internal chemical profile might introduce large deviations from the mean period spacing due to the abrupt change in the composition gradient . to demonstrate that the models are not unusually sensitive to our profiles when compared to smooth profiles , we calculated the pulsation periods of models with the best - fit parameters from @xcite using several internal chemical profiles .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig6 ] . in the top panel ,",
    "we show the brunt - visl frequency in the region of the models that correspond to the internal chemical profile . in the bottom panel ,",
    "we show the period spacing diagrams for each of these models .",
    "we find that deviations from the mean period spacing for a model using an internal chemical profile from our parameterization have a magnitude comparable to those caused by a profile with a uniform c / o mixture out the the 95 percent mass point .",
    "the smooth profile from @xcite causes the largest deviations of the three ."
