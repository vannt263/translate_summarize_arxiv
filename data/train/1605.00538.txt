    "a quadrisecant for a knot is a line that intersects the knot in four points . in 1933",
    ", pannwitz @xcite showed that a generic polygonal knot in any nontrivial knot type must have at least two quadrisecants .",
    "this result was extended to smooth knots by morton and mond @xcite and to tame knots by kuperberg @xcite .",
    "quadrisecants was used to give lower bounds of the ropelength of a knot in @xcite .",
    "the quadrisecant approximation of a knot was introduced by jin in @xcite . for a knot @xmath0 with finitely many quadrisecants ,",
    "let @xmath1 be the set of intersection points of @xmath0 with the quadrisecants .",
    "the _ quadrisecant approximation _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath2 , is obtained from @xmath0 by replacing each subarc of @xmath0 between two points in @xmath1 adjacent along @xmath0 with the straight line segment between them .",
    "if @xmath0 has no quadrisecants ( which has to be an unknot ) , we let @xmath3 .",
    "a knot as the union of finitely many line segments is called a polygonal knot .",
    "it was showed in @xcite that almost every polygonal knot has only finitely many quadrisecants ( see also @xcite ) . in every knot type",
    ", there is a polygonal knot such that the quadrisecant approximation has the same knot type .",
    "in fact , the following conjecture was proposed in the same paper :    [ conj : ori ] if @xmath0 has finitely many quadrisecants , then its quadrisecant approximation @xmath2 has the same knot type as @xmath0 . furthermore @xmath0 and @xmath2 have the same set of quadrisecants .",
    "the conjecture were verified for some knots with crossing number not bigger than five in @xcite and for hexagonal trefoil knots in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we work on polygonal knots . for a polygonal knot ,",
    "let @xmath4 be the number of edges in @xmath0 .",
    "for a knot type @xmath5 , the edge number @xmath6 is the smallest number of edges among all polygonal knots with type @xmath5 .",
    "we show the following :    [ thm : main ] for any knot type @xmath5 , there exist polygonal knots @xmath7 and @xmath8 of type @xmath5 such that the quadrisecant approximation @xmath9 has self - intersections while @xmath10 is a knot with knot type different from @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , we can require that @xmath11 and @xmath12 . if @xmath5 does not contain the trefoil knot as a connected summand",
    ", we can require that @xmath13 .",
    "hence conjecture [ conj : ori ] does not hold in general .",
    "however , in view that our counterexamples contain redundant edges , and with the results in @xcite , the following weaker conjecture may still hold    [ conj : re ] for a polygonal knot @xmath0 of type @xmath5 with @xmath6 edges and finitely many quadrisecants , the quadrisecant approximation @xmath2 has knot type @xmath5 .    given a knot type @xmath5 , let @xmath14 be the minimal number @xmath15 for polygonal knots @xmath0 with type @xmath5 such that @xmath2 has self - intersections , and let @xmath16 be the minimal number @xmath15 for polygonal knots @xmath0 with type @xmath5 such that @xmath2 is a knot with type different from @xmath5 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] shows that @xmath17 and @xmath18 for general knots and @xmath19 for @xmath5 which does not contain the trefoil knot as a connected summand .",
    "hence the following question is natural :    for a given knot type @xmath5 , what are @xmath14 and @xmath16 ?",
    "in particular , are @xmath14 and @xmath16 always positive ?    the second question is equivalent to conjecture [ conj : re ] . on the other hand , in our examples",
    ", the knot type @xmath10 is the connected sum of @xmath8 with the trefoil knots .",
    "hence we have the following question :    given a knot type @xmath5 , what knot types can be given by @xmath2 for knots @xmath0 with type @xmath5 ? is the knot type of @xmath2 always a connected sum for which @xmath5 is a summand ?",
    "can @xmath2 be in some sense  simpler \" than @xmath0 ?",
    "in particular , can the quadrisecant approximation @xmath2 be the unknot for a knot @xmath0 with nontrivial knot type ?",
    "we remark that the examples in theorem [ thm : main ] can be modified to give corresponding examples in the smooth category , for example , by smoothing the corners .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : algorithm ] we will explain how to find all quadrisecants of a given knot . in section [ sec : unknot ] we will give two trivial knots @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 edges , such that @xmath24 has self - intersections while @xmath25 is a trefoil knot . in section [ sec : general ]",
    "we will use a carefully defined connected sum operation to generalize the examples to show theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "in this section , we give an algorithm to find all quadrisecants of a given polygonal knot .",
    "the results will be used in the construction of counterexamples in the following sections .",
    "let @xmath26 be a polygonal knot in @xmath27 .",
    "the case when @xmath28 is trivial , hence we always assume @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 , and for @xmath31 , let @xmath32 .",
    "we require that @xmath0 is in general position , namely @xmath0 satisfies following    1 .",
    "no four vertices of @xmath0 are coplanar ; 2 .",
    "the vectors for any three edges of @xmath0 are linear independent .    given three vectors @xmath33 ,",
    "let @xmath34 be their determinant .",
    "then the above two conditions are equivalent to the following :    1 .   for @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath36 2 .   for @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 is a quadrisecant of @xmath0 , then there are four edges @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath35 , such that for @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 namely the intersection point is in the interior of the edge or is the initial point of the edge .",
    "then the intersection points can be presented as @xmath46 since the four points are collinear , there exist @xmath47 such that @xmath48 by @xmath49 and the cramer s rule , we have @xmath50 @xmath51 let @xmath52 , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath55 and @xmath56 are symmetric . since @xmath35 , @xmath57 are four distinct points and @xmath58 are four distinct points . by @xmath59",
    ", we have @xmath60 hence by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are dependent on each other .",
    "and we can solve @xmath65 , then get @xmath66 .",

    "let @xmath63 vary in @xmath79 , then we get a ruled surface @xmath80 which is the union of lines passing through the corresponding @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 . if @xmath84 then by @xmath59 , we have @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    ". then @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath39 can not be a quadrisecant .",
    "if only one of the determinants is zero , then @xmath80 is a part of a plane , and @xmath81 or @xmath83 is fixed when @xmath63 varies . if both determinants are nonzero , then one can check that @xmath80 is a quadric",
    ".    hence if the equation @xmath89 has infinitely many solutions , then @xmath90 , and the four edges @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 must be linear dependent or lie on a quadric generated by @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this is also the result in @xcite that , for four edges in general position , there are at most two straight lines intersecting each of them , corresponding to two solutions of @xmath89 with @xmath91 .    by the above discussion",
    ", for a given polygonal knot @xmath0 , we have an algorithm to find all its quadrisecants , that is , to find all possible @xmath92 for every four edges of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is in general position and no edge of @xmath0 lies on a quadric generated by other three edges , then @xmath0 have finitely many quadrisecants .",
    "we can then get its quadrisecant approximation . in the following section",
    ", we will use this algorithm to determine the quadrisecant approximation of a given polygonal knot .",
    "most computations in the present paper are performed by mathematica 6.0 .",
    "in this section , we will give two polygonal unknots @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 edges respectively such that @xmath24 has self - intersections , and @xmath25 is a trefoil knot .",

    "<S> if a knot has finitely many quadrisecants , one can replace each subarc between two adjacent secant points by the line segment between them to get the quadrisecant approximation of the original knot . </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured that the quadrisecant approximation is always a knot with the same knot type as the original knot . </S>",
    "<S> we show that every knot type contains two knots , the quadrisecant approximation of one knot has self intersections while the quadrisecant approximation of the other knot is a knot with different knot type . </S>"
