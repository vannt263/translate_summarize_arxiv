    "[ concl ] .",
    "the gc extinction has been observationally obtained by @xcite ( the region 1.319 @xmath9 ) , @xcite ( 1.28 @xmath9 ) , and @xcite ( 1.225 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the latter paper contains the probable extinction profile of the 9.7  @xmath9 silicate feature for the gc .",
    "all data have been normalized by us in order to have @xmath3 at @xmath11 , @xmath12 they are plotted in all figures below .",
    "it should be note that the gc extinction was estimated from observations in different ways . as a result",
    ", the data of @xcite were mainly derived for the central 14@xmath1320@xmath14 region , the data of @xcite are averaged over the region @xmath15 , and the data of @xcite are the extinction towards the wolf - rayet star wr 98a ( @xmath16 ) extended to the line of sight to gcs3 . however , the extinction law for @xmath17 is practically the same .",
    "hence , the data can be combined , and the question on where is located the dust that produces the extinction is not as important as it could be .",
    "we base our analysis on the model of @xcite who chose the initial size distributions of silicate and carbonaceous dust that fited the mean milky way extinction curve with @xmath18 @xcite and considered dust grain size evolution due to the accretion and coagulation processes .",
    "so , our model contains two populations of grains : silicate ( si ) and carbonaceous ( c ) ones with the size distributions from @xcite . as extinction only weekly depends on the particle shape @xcite , we assume that dust grains are spherical .",
    "thus , the model has the following parameters : 1 ) the chemical composition of silicate and carbonaceous particles ; 2 ) the structure of particles ; 3 ) the relative number of silicate grains @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the column densities of silicate grains and all dust particles , respectively ; 4 ) the time of evolution .",
    "sometimes , we also included an additional population of dust .",
    "when considering the chemical composition , we mainly oriented on the optical constants obtained in jena laboratory ( http://www.astro-uni-jena.de/laboratory/ ) .",
    "information about these and many other data is collected in the heidelberg ",
    "petersburg database of optical constants ( hjpdoc ) described by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the fitting procedure was as follows .",
    "first , we fitted the extinction shortward 8.8 @xmath9 , i.e. 19 points from @xcite and all 10 points from @xcite .",
    "the values of the normalized @xmath23 given in table  [ mod ] just characterize this fitting .",
    "then , by varying the fraction of silicate grains @xmath63 , we fitted the relative strength of the 10  @xmath9 band .",
    "the position of the band was mainly fitted by the proper choice of the silicate material .",
    "the relative strength and position of the band at 10 @xmath9 were taken from @xcite .",
    "note that their data for the 18 @xmath9 band are less reliable and that many silicates have the bending bands in the range @xmath64 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we did not model the 18@xmath9 band .",
    "we have considered a number of two- and three - component models with compact homogeneous grains .",
    "we started with the standard mixture of grains of artificial silicate , astrosil , and amorphous carbon acbe@xmath30zu ( model 1 , see table  [ mod ] and fig .",
    "as expected , the wavelength dependence of extinction derived was steeper than that given by observations .",
    "the next step was to find better models by variations of the laboratory optical constants .",
    "a comparison between the models with the aliphatic and aromatic carbon ( models 2 , 3 ) showed that the near - ir ( @xmath65 ) and mid - ir extinction was much better reproduced by the model with aromatic carbon cell1000 .",
    "so , we chose this material as the basic one in the subsequent modelling .",
    "note that the carbon materials cell400 and cell1000 used by us differ in the degree of `` graphitization '' @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the former , in first approximation the imaginary part of the refractive index @xmath66 for @xmath67 , while for the latter , @xmath68 ( for graphite , @xmath69 grow with @xmath8 ) .",
    "obviously , such graphitization favours excess ir extinction .",
    "further , we examined different types of silicates : olivines and pyroxenes with different content of mg and fe ( models 3  8) .",
    "as can be seen , olivines better explain the observations as the silicate peak produced by pyroxenes is shifted to @xmath70 ( table  [ mod ] and fig .",
    "though forsterite grains ( model 5 ) well fit the observed mid - ir extinction , in this case dust grains contain no iron , which is hardly probable according to contemporary understanding of cosmic dust origin and evolution . our attempts to add iron or water ice as the third component into our silicate - carbonaceous mixture ( models 10 , 11 ) failed as mid - ir extinction always became steeper .",
    "the physical conditions in which dust grains originate and grow should lead to formation of heterogeneous particles , in particular , porous .",
    "two grain structures are generally expected : layered particles corresponding to subsequent accretion of different species , and an alternative  particles with small more or less randomly distributed inclusions . in the former case",
    "the optical properties of heterogeneous particles are modelled with the mie - like theory for layered particles ( in particular , core - mantle ) , in the latter case by using homogeneous particles with the averaged dielectric functions ( emt - mie calculations ) .",
    "we present four models with porous silicate or carbonaceous particles ( models 12 , 13 and 18 , 19 ) to illustrate that the porosity does not make the fitting much better in a comparison with compact grains , but leads to the shift and decrease of the silicate peak .",
    "we have also considered the models with the refractive indexes constructed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( models 14  17 ) .",
    "none of these models produces the flat mid - ir extinction with the worst fit to the data given by aliphatic carbon optec@xmath48 ( model 15 ) .",
    "the models 20 and 21 with core - mantle grains give a good opportunity to test the hypotheses of @xcite who predicted that in the diffuse ism large a - c : h grains are to be covered by a a - c 20 nm thick envelope and large si grains by a a - c 5 nm thick envelope .",
    "as can be seen , in this case extinction is inconsistent with the observations of the flat mid - ir extinction in the gc .",
    "note that an increase of the thickness of the a - c mantles of silicate grains leads to an increase of the mid - ir extinction as has been demonstrated in the work of @xcite , where they have also analyzed the effect of `` dirtiness '' of silicates ( due to absorbing inclusions of fes ) .",
    "however , this increase is certainly not enough , while the thick a - c mantles begin to affect the silicate bands strength ( see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "the use of multi - layered particles permits a more sophisticated treatment of the processes of grain growth and evolution .",
    "specifically , it is possible to analyse the role of iron which is one of the major dust - forming elements @xcite . the abundance of iron in the solid - phase of the ism may reach 97 ",
    "99% of the cosmic abundance @xcite .",
    "iron can be incorporated into dust grains in the form of oxides ( feo , fe@xmath40o@xmath55 , fe@xmath55o@xmath56 ) , ( mg / fe)-silicates , sulfide ( fes ) , and metallic iron .",
    "the last two cases come from the contemporary theory of dust condensation in circumstellar environments .",
    "@xcite note that fe and fes start to condense at temperatures well below the stability limits of silicates like forsterite and enstatite .",
    "this should lead to formation of layered particle . at low temperatures ,",
    "the conversion of solid iron into iron oxides may occur @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the wavelength dependence of extinction for the models with three - layered particles including of olivine and vacuum .",
    "iron is located in the particle core ( model 22 ) , intermediate layer ( model 23 ) , or outer layer ( model 24 ) .",
    "as seen , the presence of metallic iron at any place inside a particle , excluding its core , drastically changes extinction  iron totally screens the underlying layers and influences the optics of the overlying ones . as a result , one can not properly reproduce either the position and shape of the observed silicate band ( models 23 , 24 ) or the slope of the wavelength dependence of ir extinction ( models 22 , 23 ) .",
    "however , iron can be oxidized or sulfidized , which opens a way to explain the observations .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows the extinction calculated for four models with olivine particles ( olmg50 ) coated by a thin very porous layer and a thin ( 2  3 nm thick ) envelope of iron oxide or iron sulfide .",
    "it is evident that the model 25 with magnetite agrees closely with the observational data .",
    "this model well reproduces near - ir extinction and the 10@xmath9 peak and gives nearly as large mid - ir extinction as observed .",
    "the model also produces the visual extinction @xmath71 which is close to the observed median value equal to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "note that the replacement of olivine with pyroxene ( model 29 ) leads to even a better coincidence with the observed extinction at @xmath73 but does not allow one to explain properly the near - ir extinction and the position of the silicate feature .",
    "so , we see that the model 25 is practically the only way of successful fitting of the data , when keeping in mind available information on cosmic dust .",
    "considering the model 25 with the particles from olivine olmg50 and amorphous carbon cell1000 as a _ prototype _ of possible dust models for the gc .",
    "in previous modelling we ignored the distribution of the extinction along the line of sight .",
    "however , the 3-dimensional extinction map of the gc shows that about half of the extinction in the sightlines of @xcite is reached in a distance of about 5 kpc from the sun ( see fig .  9 in",
    "we assume different populations of dust grains in the foreground dusty complexes and in the central galactic region most likely the dust producing the foreground extinction is processed , in particular , the silicate grains are covered by carbon @xcite .",
    "such grains are properly described by the theoretical model 20 and give very low relative extinction in the mid - ir ( @xmath74 , see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] and * ? ? ?",
    "however , there exist several places in the galaxy where low mid - ir extinction has been observed . on fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we plotted the average extinction for three molecular clouds obtained by @xcite .",
    "it is visible that the model 20 agrees roughly with the measurements .    for the central galactic region",
    ", we applied the model 25 with freshly formed silicate dust .",
    "the total extinction for our `` two - cloud '' model was calculated as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the contribution of the foreground clouds to the total extinction . at the moment , the available data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not allow one to estimate the value of @xmath76 with a sufficient accuracy , therefore , we just use 0.5 for simplicity .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] and table  [ mod ] show the extinction produced by the two - cloud model ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "its agreement with the observational data is not perfect but good enough .",
    "according to the modern ideas on cosmic dust evolution in the diffuse ism , the silicate grains should be covered by a significant envelope from amorphous carbon on a short time scale @xcite . moreover ,",
    "amorphous olivine mgfesio@xmath56 ( olmg50 ) is a possible mineral in dust grains forming in the atmospheres of late - type giants , but it is not believed to be the main material of silicate particles in the ism ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we suggest that silicate dust in our model is `` fresh '' , i.e. recently formed in the atmospheres of the late - type stars in the gc .",
    "our suggestion is rather natural as the gc is dominated by old stars .",
    "carbonaceous particles are more processed in comparison with silicate ones that is determined by lower efficiency of their destruction @xcite .",
    "intense radiation fields in the gc are favourable for the fast photo  dissociative aromatisation of a - c(:h ) materials @xcite .",
    "obviously , the model found by us does not fit the data perfectly and one can not exclude other possible solutions to the problem of the flat mid - ir extinction towards the gc .",
    "however , we pay attention to the potential of our approach  to relate the problem solution with specific structure and composition of dust grains relying the laboratory data on optical constants and contemporary ideas on cosmic dust grain evolution .",

    "<S> we interpret the interstellar extinction observed towards the galactic center ( gc ) in the wavelength range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> its main feature is the flat extinction at @xmath1 whose explanation is still a problem for the cosmic dust models . </S>",
    "<S> we search for structure and chemical composition of dust grains that could explain the observed extinction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to earlier works we use laboratory measured optical constants and consider particles of different structure . we show that a mixture of compact grains of aromatic carbon and of some silicate is better suited for reproducing the flat extinction in comparison with essentially porous grains or aliphatic carbon particles . </S>",
    "<S> metallic iron should be located inside the particle , i.e. can not form layers on silicate grains as the extinction curves become then very peculiar . </S>",
    "<S> we find a model including aromatic carbonaceous particles and three - layered particles with an olivine - type silicate core , a thin very porous layer and a thin envelope of magnetite that provides a good ( but still not perfect ) fit to the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that such silicate dust should be fresh , i.e. recently formed in the atmospheres of late - type stars in the central region of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that this region has a radius of about 1 kpc and produces about a half of the observed extinction . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining part of extinction is caused by a `` foreground '' material being practically transparent at @xmath2 . </S>"
