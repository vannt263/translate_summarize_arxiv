    "the spin - triplet superconducting phase is believed to appear in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite , uge@xmath0 @xcite , and urhge @xcite . in the last two compounds the considered type of superconducting phase occurs as coexisting with ferromagnetism .",
    "additionally , even though u atoms in this compounds contain 5f electrons responsible for magnetism , this multiple - band system can be regarded as weakly or moderately correlated electron system , particularly at higher pressure .",
    "originally it has been suggested via a proper quantitative analysis @xcite@xmath2@xcite , that the the intra atomic hund s rule exchange can lead in a natural manner to the coexistence of superconductivity with magnetic ordering - ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism .",
    "the coexisting superconducting and magnetic phases are discussed in this work within an orbitally degenerate two - band hubbard model using the hartree - fock approximation ( hf ) , here combined with the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approach , i.e. , in the vicinity of the ferromagnetism disappearance , where also the superconductivity occurs .",
    "the particular emphasis is put on the appearance of superconductivity near the stoner threshold , where the hartree - fock - bcs approximation can be regarded as realistic .",
    "this type of approach can be formulated also for other systems @xcite .",
    "the alternative suggested mechanism for appearance of superconductivity in those systems is the pairing mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which can also appear in the paramagnetic or weakly ferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "here , the mean - field approximation provides not only the starting magnetic phase diagram but also a related discussion of the superconducting states treated on equal footing . in this approach",
    "the spin - fluctuation contribution appears as a next - order contribution .",
    "this is the reason for undertaking a revision of the standard hartree - fock approximation .",
    "namely , we concentrate here on the spin triplet states , pure and coexisting with either ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism , depending on the relative magnitude of microscopic parameters : the hubbard intra- and inter - orbital interactions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , the hund s rule ferromagnetic exchange integral @xmath5 , the relative magnitude of hybridization @xmath6 , and the band filling @xmath7 . the bare band width @xmath8 is taken as unit of energy . in the concluding section we discuss briefly , how to outline the approach to include also the quantum fluctuations around this hf - bcs ( saddle point ) state , as a higher - order contribution .",
    "the role of exchange interactions is crucial in both the so - called t - j model of high temperature superconductivity @xcite and in the so - called kondo - mediated pairing in heavy fermion systems @xcite . in this and",
    "the following papers we discuss the idea of real space pairing for the triplet - paired states in the regime of weakly correlated particles and include both the inter - band hybridization and the corresponding coulomb interactions .",
    "we think that this relatively simple approach is relevant to the mentioned at the beginning ferromagnetic superconductors because of the following reasons .",
    "although the effective exchange ( weiss - type ) field acts only on the spin degrees of freedom , it is important in determining the second critical field of ferromagnetic superconductor in the so - called pauli limit @xcite , as the orbital effects in the cooper - pair breaking process are then negligible .",
    "the appearance of a stable coexistent ferromagnetic - superconducting phase means , that either pauli limiting situation critical field has not been reached in the case of spin - singlet pairing or else , the pairing has the spin - triplet nature , without the component with spin @xmath9 , and then the pauli limit is not operative .",
    "the present model with local spin - triplet pairing has its precedents of the same type in the case of spin - singlet pairing , i.e. , the hubbard model with @xmath10 @xcite , which played the central role in singling out a nontrivial character of pairing in real space . here ,",
    "the same role is being played by the intra - atomic ( but inter - orbital ) ferromagnetic exchange .",
    "we believe that this area of research unexplored so far in detail opens up new possibilities of studies of weakly and moderately correlated magnetic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the model and the full hartee - fock - bcs approximation ( i. e. mean field approximation for magnetic ordering with the concomitant bcs - type decoupling ) for the coexistent two - sublattice antiferromagnetic and spin - triplet superconducting phase ( cf . also appendix a for details ) . for completeness ,",
    "in appendix b we include also the analysis of a simpler coexistant superconducting - ferromagnetic phase . in section 3",
    "we provide a detailed numerical analysis and construct the full phase diagram on the hund s rule coupling - band filling plane .",
    "we describe also the physical properties of the coexistent phases . in appendix c",
    "we sketch a systematic approach of going beyond hartree - fock approximation , i.e. , including the spin fluctuations , starting from our hartree - fock - bcs state .",
    "we start with the extended orbitally degenerate hubbard hamiltonian , which has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 label the orbitals and the first term describes electron hopping between atomic sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for @xmath15",
    "this term represents electron hopping with change of the orbital ( inter - site , inter - orbital hybridization ) .",
    "next two terms describe the coulomb interaction between electrons on the same atomic site . however as one can see the second term contains the contribution that originates from the exchange interaction ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the last term expresses the ( hund s rule ) ferromagnetic exchange between electrons localized on the same site , but on different orbitals .",
    "this term is regarded as responsible for the local spin - triplet pairing in the subsequent discussion .",
    "the components of the spin operator @xmath16 used in ( [ eq : h_start ] ) aquire the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the pauli matrices and @xmath19 . in our considerations we neglect the interaction - induced intra - atomic singlet - pair hopping ( @xmath20 ) and",
    "the correlation induced hopping ( @xmath21 ) @xcite , as they should not introduce any important new qualitative feature in the considered here spin - triplet paired states .",
    "what is more important , we assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , the starting degenerate bands have the same width ( _ the extreme degeneracy limit _ ) , as we are interested in establishing new qualitative features to the overall phase diagram , that are introduced by the magnetic pairing .",
    "as has already been said , the aim of this work is to examine the spin - triplet superconductivity coexisting with ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism as well as the pure spin - triplet superconducting phase and the pure magnetically ordered phases .",
    "labels defining the spin - triplet paired phases ( a and a1 ) that are going to be used in this work correspond to those defined for superfluid @xmath24he according to the refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "namely in the a phase the superconducting gaps that correspond to cooper pairs with total spin up and down are equal ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , whereas in the a1 phase the only nonzero superconducting gap is the one that corresponds to the cooper pair with total spin up ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) . in this section",
    "we show the method of calculations that is appropriate for the superconducting phase coexisting with antiferromagnetism , as well as pure superconducting phase of type a and pure antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the corresponding considerations for the case of ferromagnetically ordered phases and superconducting phase a1 are deferred to the appendix b.    from the start we make use of the fact that the full exchange term can be represented by the real - space spin - triplet pairing operators , in the following manner @xmath29 which are of the form @xmath30 furthermore the inter - orbital coulomb repulsion term can be expressed with the use of spin - triplet pairing operators and the spin - singlet pairing operators in the following manner @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the inter - orbital , intra - atomic spin - singlet pairing operators in real space . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hund_pairing ] ) and ( [ eq : u_prime ] ) one can write down our model hamiltonian in the form @xmath33 it should be noted here that for @xmath34 , the inter - orbital coulomb repulsion suppresses the spin - triplet pairing mechanism and the superconducting phases will not appear in the system in the weak - coupling ( hartree - fock ) limit . for @xmath35 electrons @xcite , @xmath36 , thus the necessary condition for the pairing to occur in our model is @xmath37 .",
    "usually , for 3d metals we have @xmath38 , so it represents a rather stringent condition for the superconductivity to appear in that situation .",
    "we use this relation to fix the parameters for modeling purposes , not limited to 3d systems .",
    "this is also because e.g. 5f electrons in uranium compounds lead to a similar behavior as do 3d electrons .",
    "one should note that the considered here pairing is based on the intra - atomic inter - orbital ferromagnetic hund s rule exchange .",
    "a simple extension to the situation with nonlocal j has been considered by x. dai et al . @xcite . also , as we consider only weakly correlated regime , where the metallic state is stable , no orbital ordering is expected ( cf .",
    "klejnberg and spaek in @xcite ) .    in our considerations the antiferromagnetic state represents the simplest example of the spin - density - wave state .",
    "in this state , we can divide our system into two interpenetrating sublattices @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the average staggered magnetic moment of electrons on each of the @xmath41 sublattice @xmath39 sites is equal , @xmath42 , whereas on the remaining @xmath41 sublattice @xmath40 sites we have @xmath43 .",
    "in accordance with this division into two sublattices , we define different annihilation operators for each sublattice , namely @xmath44 the same holds for the creation operators , @xmath45 .",
    "we assume that the charge ordering is absent .",
    "in this situation , we can write that @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath7 is the band filling . in",
    "what follows , we treat the pairing and the hubbard parts in the combined mean - field - bcs approximation . in effect , we can write down the hamiltonian transformed in reciprocal ( @xmath48 ) space in the form :    @xmath49\\\\ & + \\sum_{kll^{\\prime}(l\\neq l^{\\prime } \\sigma ) } \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}12}(a^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k}l\\sigma a}a_{\\mathbf{k}l^{\\prime}\\sigma b } + a^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k}l\\sigma b}a_{\\mathbf{k}l^{\\prime}\\sigma a})+\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}l\\sigma}\\bigg[\\frac{n}{8}(u+2u^{\\prime } -j)-\\mu\\bigg ] ( \\hat { n } _ { \\mathbf{k}l\\sigma a}+\\hat{n}_{\\mathbf{k}l\\sigma b})\\\\ & + \\sum_{\\mathbf{k},m=\\pm 1}(\\delta_{ma}^*\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}ma}+\\delta_{ma}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k}ma } ) + \\sum _ { \\mathbf{k},m=\\pm 1}(\\delta_{mb}^*\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}mb}+\\delta_{mb}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } _ { \\mathbf{k}mb})\\\\ & + \\sqrt{2}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\delta_{0a}^*\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}0a}+\\delta_{0a}\\hat { a}^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k } 0a } ) + \\sqrt{2}\\sum _ { \\mathbf{k}}(\\delta_{0b}^*\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}0b}+\\delta_{0b}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } _ { \\mathbf{k}0b})-n\\frac{n^2}{16}(u+2u^{\\prime } -j)\\\\ & + 2ni(\\bar{s}^z_s)^2-\\frac{n}{2(j - u^{\\prime})}(|\\delta_{1a}|^2+|\\delta_{-1a }        \\end{split } \\label{eq : h_hf}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the effective magnetic coupling constant and @xmath51 is the dispersion relation .",
    "the results presented in the next section have been carried out for square lattice with nonzero hopping @xmath52 between nearest neighbors only .",
    "the corresponding bare dispersion relation in a nonhybridized band acquires the form : @xmath53 as we are considering the doubly degenerate band model situation , we make a simplifying assumption that the hybridization matrix element @xmath54 , where @xmath55 $ ] is the parameter , which specifies the hybridization strength ( i.e. represents a second scale of electron energies , in addition to @xmath56 ) .",
    "this means that we have just one active atom per unit cell with a doubly degenerate orbital of the same kind ( their spatial asymmetry is disregarded ) .",
    "one should note that the sums in ( [ eq : h_hf ] ) ( and in all corresponding equations below ) is taken over n/2 independent @xmath48 states . in the hamiltonian written above we have also introduced the superconducting spin - triplet sublattice gap parameters @xmath57 the terms : @xmath58 and @xmath59 in ( [ eq : h_hf ] ) can be neglected , as they lead only to a shift of the reference point of the system energy .",
    "one should note that since the real - space pairing mechanism is of intra - atomic nature , there is no direct conflict with either ferro- or antiferro - magnetic ordering coexisting with it .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_hf ] ) can be carried out in two steps . in the first step we diagonalize the one particle part of the hartree - fock hamiltonian ( the first two sums of ( [ eq : h_hf ] ) ) .",
    "note that we have to carry out this step first , since we assume the bands are both hybridized and contain pairing part . by introducing the four - composite fermion operator @xmath60",

    "if @xmath73 is not @xmath74 , we may have four non - degenerate slater subbands , which is not the case considered here . to express the pairing operators that are present in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_hf ] ) in terms of the new quasi - particle operators",

    "one could also consider the so called superconducting phase of type b for which all superconducting gaps ( including @xmath118 ) are equal and different from zero . however this phase never coexists with magnetic ordering .",

    "therefore the superconducting b phase is absent in the following discussion .",
    "we assume that @xmath36 and @xmath119 , so there are actually two independent parameters in the considered model - @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "the energies have been normalized to the bare band - width @xmath120 , and @xmath105 expresses the reduced temperature , @xmath121 .      in fig . [",
    "fig : diag_all ] a - d we present the complete phase diagrams in coordinates @xmath122 for different values of the hybridization parameter @xmath6 .",
    "they comprise sizeable regions of stable spin - triplet superconducting phase coexisting with either ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism , as well as pure superconducting phase a. in the phase sc+af the calculated gap parameters fulfill the relations @xmath123 for the singlet paired state one would have @xmath124 , which is not the case here . for the case of half filled band , @xmath125 , the superconducting gaps @xmath126 and @xmath127 vanish and only pure ( slater type ) af survives .",
    "the appearance of the af state for @xmath125 corresponds to the fact that the bare fermi - surface topology has a rectangular structure with @xmath128 nesting .",
    "this feature survives also for @xmath129 .",
    "also , the symmetry of the phase diagrams with respect to half - filled band situation is a manifestation of the particle - hole symmetry , since the bare density of states is symmetric with respect to the middle point of the band .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : values_tab ]",
    "we have carried out the hartree - fock - bcs analysis of the hybridized two - band hubbard model with the hunds - rule induced magnetism and spin - triplet pairing .",
    "we have determined the regions of stability of the spin - triplet paired phases with @xmath130 , coexisting with either ferromagnetism ( a1+fm ) or antiferromagnetism ( sc+af ) , as well as pure paired phase ( a ) .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the effect of inter band hybridization on stability of the those phases .",
    "the hybridization reduces significantly the stability regime of the superconducting phase a , mainly in favor of the paramagnetic ( normal ) phase , ns . for large enough value of @xmath6 ( @xmath131 ) ,",
    "the a phase disappears altogether . when it comes to magnetism , with the increase of @xmath6 , the stability regime of the saturated ferromagnetically ordered phase",
    "is reduced in favor of the non - saturated .",
    "the influence of the hybridization on the low - temperature stability of the sc+af phase is not significant . when the system is close to the half filling , the sc+af phase is the stable one",
    "however , for the half filled band case ( @xmath125 ) , the superconductivity disappears and only pure antiferromagnetic state survives , since the nesting effect of the two - dimentional band structure prevails then .",
    "we have also examined the temperature dependence of the order parameters and the specific heat . for both coexistent superconducting and",
    "magnetically ordered phases ( sc+af and a1+fm ) one observes two separate phase transitions with the increasing temperature .",
    "the first of them , at substantially lower temperature ( @xmath132 ) , is the transition from the superconducting - magnetic coexistent phase to the pure magnetic phase and the second , occuring at much higher temperature ( @xmath133 or @xmath134 ) , is from the magnetic to the paramagnetic phase ( ns ) .",
    "the hybridization has a negative influence on the spin - triplet superconductivity , since it reduces the critical temperature for each type of the spin - triplet superconducting phase considered here . on the other hand ,",
    "the curie ( @xmath134 ) and the nel ( @xmath135 ) temperatures are increasing with the increase of the @xmath6 parameter , as it generally increases the density of states at the fermi level ( for appropriate band fillings ) .",
    "one sholud note that since the pairing is intra - atomic in nature the spin - triplet gaps @xmath136 are of the @xmath137 type .",
    "this constitutes one of the differences with the corresponding situation for superfluid @xmath138 , where they are of @xmath139 type @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that the paired state appears both below and above the stoner threshold for the onset of ferromagnetism ( cf .",
    "[ fig : diag_stoner ] ) , though its nature changes ( a and a1 states , respectively ) . in the ferromagnetically ordered phase only the spin - majority carriers are paired .",
    "this is not the case for af+sc phase .",
    "it would be very interesting to try to detect such highly unconventional sc phase .",
    "in particular the andreev reflection and in general , the ns / sc conductance spectroscopy will have an unusual character .",
    "we should see progress along this line of research soon .    as mentioned before all the results presented in the previous section",
    "has been obtained assuming that @xmath119 and @xmath36 .",
    "having said that the value of @xmath140 determines the strength of the pairing mechanism while @xmath141 is the effective magnetic coupling constant , one can roughly predict how will the change in the relations between @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 result .",
    "it seems reasonable to say that the larger is @xmath5 with respect to @xmath4 the stronger the superconducting gap in the paired phases .",
    "this would also result in the increase of @xmath134 and a corresponding enlargement of the area occupied by the superconducting phases on the diagrams .",
    "furthermore the increase of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath5 should result in the increase of the ratios @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "this is because in that manner we make the magnetic coupling stronger with respect to the pairing .",
    "if we however increase @xmath3 but do not change @xmath144 , then the strength of the pairing would be the same but the magnetic coupling constant would be stronger so this would favor the coexistent magnetic and superconducting phases with respect to the pure superconducting phase .",
    "quite stringent necessary condition for the pairing to appear @xmath145 ( equivalent to @xmath146 if we assume @xmath36 , as has been done here ) indicates that only in specific materials one would expect for the hund s rule to create the superconducting phase .",
    "this may explain why only in very few compounds the coexistent ferromagnetic and superconducting phase has been indeed observed . obviously , one still has to add the paramagnon pairing ( cf .",
    "appendix c ) .    it should be noted that more exotic magnetic phases may appear in the two - band model @xcite .",
    "here , we neglect those phases because of two reasons . first the lattice selected for analysis is bipartite , with strong nesting ( af tendency ) .",
    "second the additional ferrimagnetic , spiral , etc . , phase might appear if we assumed that the second hopping integral @xmath147 .",
    "inclusion of @xmath148 would require a separate analysis , as the lattice becomes frustrated then .",
