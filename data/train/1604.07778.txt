    "the concept of _ entropy _ plays a key role in describing the transition between disorder and order .",
    "specifically , the emergence of order in a random phase is indicated by a significant reduction of entropy .",
    "calculating this reduction requires to know the probability of each possible system configuration that is compatible with the given system constraints - a challenging problem both methodologically and computationally .",
    "if we consider a system of @xmath0 elements each of which can be in one of two states  for example up and down spins in a physical system , or agents with opposite opinions in a social system , or agents with the two strategies _ cooperate _ or _ defect _ in an economic system  the number of possible configurations is @xmath1 , which can be quite large . in fact , statistical physics was founded in the 19th century to provide an efficient solution based on the concept of statistical ensembles and state sums .    in this paper",
    ", we address the problem by proposing a stochastic approach that allows to decompose such probabilities for systems characterized by neighbor - neighbor interactions .",
    "our candidate model to describe this interaction is the so - called _ voter model _ which is discussed in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : voter ] . in this model , agents are in one of two discrete states , @xmath2 , denoted as `` opinions '' .",
    "they change their opinion in response to the opinions in their neighborhood . in order to define such a neighborhood ,",
    "we have chosen a one - dimensional cellular automaton ( ca ) , in which consecutively numbered cells @xmath3 represent agents ( see figure [ fig:1dca ] ) .",
    "we assume that the ca forms a ring to close the system .",
    "each agent @xmath4 then has two neighbors @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath6 i.e. their opinions @xmath7 form a _",
    "the second - order neighborhood that also takes the neighbors of @xmath5 , @xmath6 into account , then results in a _",
    "quintuplet _ of opinions @xmath9 .    ) and quintuplet ( @xmath10 ) definition of the neighborhood of agent @xmath4,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    our major assumption of the voter model is that changes in the opinion of agent @xmath4 are only caused by the first - order neighborhood .",
    "specifically , the agent responds to the _ local frequency _ of opinions in the triplet that also includes its own opinion .",
    "however , because the dynamics of agent @xmath4 depends on its neighbors , it is also coupled to their dynamics , i.e. to the second - order neighborhood of agent @xmath4 , and so forth .",
    "this specifically denotes the problem that we are going to discuss in this paper . in a stochastic approach ,",
    "we are faced with a system of @xmath0 coupled dynamic equations for the probabilities @xmath11 to find any agent @xmath4 with opinion @xmath7 at time @xmath12 .",
    "this coupling exists only through the two neighbors of each agent , i.e. changes in a far distant cell only propagate slowly through the ca by means of neighbor - neighbor interactions .",
    "so , precisely , how large should be the neighborhood taken into account for the dynamics of the ca ? or , how far reaching are correlations in the changes of opinions ?    to answer this question , in this paper we propose three different analytic approximations for the dynamics which take different neighborhood sizes into account : zero - order  no correlations between neighboring agents , first - order  correlations between an agent and one of its nearest neighbors ( so called pair approximation ) , second - order  correlations between an agent and its second - nearest neighbors .",
    "we test the validity of these dynamic approximations by comparing them to stochastic simulations of the ca , averaged over a number of runs .",
    "our emphasis is of course on the second - order approximation , which extends previous investigations .",
    "but we want to understand under which circumstances this approximation fares better than the simpler ones .",
    "therefore , we have chosen different variants of the voter model , also known as _ nonlinear voter models_. the non - linearity is with respect to the response to the local frequency of opinions .",
    "we further compare deterministic and stochastic dynamics , to show whether our analytic approximations can correctly predict the dynamics .",
    "our variable of interest is the expected fraction of opinion 1 , denoted as @xmath13 , which is an aggregated variable for which we derive the dynamics based on a stochastic approach .",
    "our paper combines , and extends , previous investigations in different directions .",
    "one line of research refers to the approximation of higher - order probability distributions by means of lower - order distributions @xcite which has been also applied to the voter model @xcite .",
    "this implies a loss of ( microscopic ) information which can be quantified by means of information - theoretic measures @xcite .",
    "the question whether the coarse - grained dynamics is still markovian can be answered by analyzing emergent macroscopic memory effects using information - theoretic measures @xcite .",
    "such measures have also been applied to voter models @xcite . in most cases , the markov chain analysis becomes quite cumbersome and therefore is restricted to one - dimensional ca @xcite .",
    "another line of research considers different forms of neighborhood approximations specifically for binary state - dynamics ( see @xcite for a good overview ) , which also has been applied to the voter model , already @xcite .",
    "we note that our pair approximation approach follows @xcite , but applies it here to a one - dimensional ca , which results in different expressions for @xmath13 and the correlations @xmath14 .",
    "compared to two - dimensional ca @xcite or even complex networks @xcite , one could find one - dimensional ca too simple .",
    "but this judgment is in fact not justified .",
    "already one - dimensional ca have proven to exhibit a really complex dynamics , with a chance to derive analytic expressions .",
    "extensions of the simple voter model , for example the sznajd model @xcite or the @xmath15-voter model @xcite , could be thoroughly analyzed for one - dimensional ca .",
    "the emphasis of our investigations is on the validity of the analytic approximations for _ nonlinear _ voter models .",
    "this non - linearity can be introduced in different ways . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors discuss it on the level of individual agents that respond to neighboring influences in a _ heterogeneous _ manner .",
    "specifically , @xcite assumes a heterogeneous inertia for agents to change their opinions , @xcite assumes a heterogeneous neighborhood size to influence agents , while @xcite assumes a heterogeneous weight for the influence of agents .",
    "compared to these approaches , we assume a _ homogeneous _ , but nonlinear response of agents on the local frequency of opinions . specifically , we consider the _ majority _",
    "rule , where the tendency of agents to change their opinion _ increases _ with the frequency of the opposite opinion .",
    "the _ minority _ rule , on the other hand , assumes exactly the opposite , i.e. a _ decreasing _ tendency .",
    "this can be simply varied by one parameter @xmath16 , which however is assumed to be the same for all agents .",
    "eventually , we would like to point out that we refrain from interpreting our model in a social context .",
    "although agents are called `` voters '' and their states are called `` opinions '' , the simplicity of the underlying assumptions does not justify to sell the model as a reflection of a social system .",
    "we see it rather as a very generic setup to better understand the impact of local feedback on emerging systemic properties , such as _ consensus _",
    "( i.e. a `` ferromagnetic '' phase ) or _ coexistence _ ( i.e. a `` paramagnetic '' phase ) .",
    "but we acknowledge that , despite this basic limitations , the voter model has been applied in various context , e.g. to model investors behavior in financial markets @xcite , emerging communication networks @xcite , or invasion of species @xcite . a good overview of spin - type models in sociophysics is given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we consider a one - dimensional cellular automaton ( ca ) consisting of @xmath0 cells , each of which is identified by the index @xmath17 ( see figure [ fig:1dca ] )",
    ". each cell shall be characterized by a discrete value @xmath18 , hence the total distribution of states is given by the vector @xmath19 .",

    "however , following the above procedure repeatedly is neither convenient nor practicable since at the end we have to consider @xmath1 possible configurations .",
    "therefore , in the next section , we present a more convenient method to determine the quintuplet probability distribution .      instead of defining the quintuplet distribution in terms of higher - order probability distributions , following the procedure of the previous section",
    ", we now make our _ 2nd assumption _ by expressing these probabilities in terms of _ lower - order distributions _ ,",
    "i.e. triplet distributions , this way arriving at a closed form description of the problem .",
    "in the following we refer to the theory of approximating discrete probability distributions already developed in the late 1950 @xcite , which was also applied to vm @xcite . the idea is to approximate an @xmath61th order probability distribution , @xmath62 by products containing the probabilities of given subsets , e.g. @xmath63 .",
    "it is known that such a product approximation contains at most @xmath61 terms , since every new term has to contain at least one variable @xmath64 not contained in previous terms .",
    "for example , the factorization @xmath65 already satisfies this condition , although it may be not a good approximation , since it holds only for ideal systems .",
    "we note that the approximation procedure is not unique , i.e. there are various ways of constructing a product approximation .",
    "for example , taking @xmath66 , this can be approximated by @xmath67 as well as by @xmath68 or by @xmath69 .",
    "which one of the above approximations is the most suitable has to be determined based on the information available about the triplet distribution @xmath66 . in some cases , there are measurements of this distribution , or additional information about the dependency between the @xmath64 as we will use below .    with reference to our quintuplet approximation using the triplets defined , we propose the following procedure : we first note that there are different triplets contained in the quintuplet configuration , for example : @xmath8 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . these are valid triplets because they consider the correct neighborhood relations , whereas for example @xmath72 would be inappropriate . out of the valid triplets ,",
    "we may choose for example the first one , @xmath73 and complete the product approximation as follows : @xmath74 in order to express the conditional probabilities using the triplet distribution , we apply bayes rule : @xmath75 which results in the final quintuplet approximation : @xmath76 we note that this product approximation is the only possible one , given that we have an ordered set of variables @xmath7 according to their neighborhood relations .      using the approximation explained above",
    ", we have reduced the higher - order description to the level of triplet distributions , @xmath77 , etc . , which results in a closed form dynamics .",
    "we now have to specify the initial conditions for the distributions .",
    "while we are able to make any suitable assumption about the initial triplet distribution , we assume here that the occupation of the different cells is initially statistically independent , i.e. @xmath78 for further investigations , we have set @xmath79 .    in order to solve the above set of equations , we have two different possibilities : we can solve the dynamics ( a ) on the level of the distribution @xmath11 , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : chap ] ) , or ( b ) on the level of the triplet distribution @xmath47 , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : chap2 ] ) .",
    "variant ( a ) requires more computational effort , since we have to replace any @xmath47 as a marginal distribution of triplets , whereas in variant ( b ) , given the reduction of the quintuplet distributions , we already have a closed form dynamics for the triplet distributions , which is computationally more efficient .    variant ( b ) , however , requires to know the transition probabilities on the level of the _ triplets _ , whereas these are usually specified on the level of single cell changes ( see also the following section ) .",
    "hence , we have to determine the propagators @xmath80 $ ] in terms of @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "since our 1st assumption specifies that the change of every cell in the triplet only depends on its nearest neighbors , we are able to factorize these transition probabilities : @xmath82=   p\\left[(\\theta_{i-1},t+1 )    \\gets ( t_{i-1},t)\\right ] \\;\\times    \\nonumber \\\\    & \\ ; \\times \\ ; p\\left[(\\theta_{i},t+1 ) \\gets ( t_{i},t)\\right ] \\ ; p\\left[(\\theta_{i+1},t+1 ) \\gets    ( t_{i+1},t)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this completes our closed form description . to calculate the time - dependent probability distribution of triplets",

    "the only remaining task is now to specify the transition probabilities for single cells , @xmath81 $ ] at which point the vm comes into play .",
    "the _ voter model _ , in its basic form , is applied to a population of @xmath0 agents , where each agent is characterized by a discrete value , its _",
    "`` opinion '' _ , @xmath83 .",
    "the _ opinion dynamics _ at the level of the agents works as follows : two agents @xmath4 and @xmath84 are _ randomly _ chosen from the population , and agent @xmath84 adopts the opinion of agent @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "after @xmath0 such update events , time is increased by 1 ( random sequential update ) .",
    "the rather simplified rule limits the applications of the voter model to any real voting process or opinion dynamics . in a well mixed population ,",
    "the probability for agent @xmath84 to adopt a given opinion @xmath2 is simply proportional to the global frequency @xmath86 of agents with the respective opinion : @xmath87 this dynamics is known to always converge to complete _ consensus _ , @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "the only interesting question is then how long it will take to reach this state dependent on the system size @xmath0 and the initial condition @xmath90 .",
    "this picture becomes more complex if instead of a well - mixed population a defined neighborhood for each agent is assumed .",
    "this can be a social network where agents have _ links _ to other agents , or simply a lattice where the neighborhood is given by the geometry that defines the nearest and second nearest neighbors of an agent .",
    "then , instead of the global frequency , the probability of an agent to adopt a given opinion depends on the _ local frequency _ , @xmath91 , of this opinion in the neighborhood of that agent : @xmath92 \\;;\\quad f_{i}^{(1{{\\kern0.1em-\\kern0.1em}}\\sigma ) } = 1 - f_{i}^{\\sigma}\\ ] ] here @xmath93 means the kronecker delta , which is 1 only for @xmath94 and zero otherwise . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the one - dimensional regular lattice , where each agent is represented by a cell @xmath4 that has precisely two neighbors .",
    "different from the basic voter rule , in the calculation of the local frequency we have taken the opinion @xmath7 of the focal cell @xmath4 into account .",
    "this adds some inertia to the dynamics as agent @xmath4 counts towards the local minority / majority .",
    "it also avoids stalemate situations where the two neighbors have different opinions .",
    "the linear voter model would assume that the transition rate @xmath95 of a focal cell @xmath4 to change its opinion from @xmath96 to @xmath97 is directly proportional to the local frequency @xmath98 , i.e. the _ opposite _ opinion in the neighborhood .",
    "the expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is a specification of the more general transition probability @xmath81 $ ] used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factor ] ) .",
    "it takes into account that for frequency dependent processes the change of @xmath7 depends not directly on the local distribution @xmath40 , but only on the _ local frequency _ @xmath98 .",
    "we are more interested in the _ non - linear _ case , where the local frequency still plays a role , however the response to the opposite opinion can be different",
    ". the linear voter model can then be generalized into a _ majority _",
    "rule where the transition toward the opposite opinion _ monotonously increases _ with the respective local frequency .",
    "different from this , the _ minority _ rule would assume that the transition toward the opposite opinion _ monotonously decreases _ with the respective local frequency ,",
    "i.e. the minority opinion is favored .",
    "eventually , we could also have _",
    "mixed rules _ with a _ non - monotonous _ frequency dependence , which become possible only if the local frequency depends at least on the opinion of three agents , as it is the case in our model .    instead of an analytical expression",
    ", we specify the transition rate @xmath99 by using free parameters @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 which cover all of the above cases in a general manner . with these",

    "the condition @xmath108 then denotes the above mentioned _ majority rule _ , because the transition rate _ increases _ with an increasing fraction of the _ opposite _ opinion @xmath109 in the neighborhood .",
    "this process is also known as _ positive freqency dependent invasion_. in ecology , it means that individuals of abundant species have a better chance to survive .",

    "our main focus was the role of local correlations in determining this outcome .",
    "for this we have used one - dimensional cellular automata ( ca ) in which each cell @xmath4 , characterized by its opinion @xmath7 , has a defined neighborhood of two cells with possibly different opinions , denoted as _ triplet_. the transition probability of a cell to change its opinion is then determined by the local _ frequency of opinions _ in its neighborhood ( including the focal cell ) and the _ non - linear response _ to this information , expressed by means of @xmath16 .",

    "i.e. , we have a non - equilibrium dynamics in which each opinion , for a certain time , can form large clusters of the majority opinion .",
    "the question then is how to describe this dynamics mathematically . in this paper , we follow a probabilistic approach , i.e. each cell has a certain probability of a given opinion @xmath227 , which also depends on the probabilities of the nearest neighbors , second - nearest neighbors , and so forth . in order to close the dynamics ,",
    "we have proposed three different approximations at different levels of the description .",
    "the first level is the aggregated description in terms of the global fraction of opinion 1 , @xmath119 , for which we derive a dynamics for the _ expected value _ , @xmath13 . on this level , we discuss two approximations . the simplest one is the _ mean - field approximation _ , in which _ no correlations _ between neighboring states are considered .",
    "so , we call this the zero - order approximation .",

    "correlations between neighbors are not considered , so we call this the 1st - order approximation .",
    "hence , we have a prediction for @xmath13 coupled to the dynamics of the pair correlations @xmath14 .",
    "the third approximation does not refer to the aggregated level , but to the stochastic dynamics of a triplet , i.e. a cell with its two neighbors , that is determined by the larger neighborhood of a quintuplet , i.e. considers also the second nearest neighbors of the cell .",
    "therefore , we call this the 2nd - order approximation . using certain assumptions , we are able to provide a _ closed form dynamics _ for this larger neighborhood in terms of a probabilistic equation",

    ", we can summarize that the zero - order approximation only predicts the stationary outcome of the minority voting correctly , but fails for the majority voting rule , both with respect to the dynamics and the stationary outcome .",
    "the first - order approximation performs comparably well in comparison to the second - order approximation only for the majority voting . the stationary outcome is correctly predicted both for the deterministic and the stochastic case , also the dynamics is covered fairly good",
    ". however , the first - order approximation fails to predict the dynamics of the minority voting .",
    "this case is only well covered by the second - order approximation that gives not only a correct description of @xmath13 , but also of the pair correlations @xmath218 .",
    "commenting specifically on the correlations , we recall again that _ both _ the first and second - order approximations lead to comparably good asymptotic results only for the majority voting . but they clearly predict a faster formation of domains , i.e. a convergence to their stationary value , as compared to the ca simulations .",
    "this limits their usability to fully understand the emergence of long - range correlations . in the case of minority voting",
    ", our first - order approximation fails , while the second - order approximation for @xmath218 could be even seen as accurate in its computational prediction .",
    "this is not so surprising if we recall that minority voting rules , different from majority voting , do _ not _ result in long - range correlations .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the quintuplet approximation that covers also the second - order neighborhood , is accurate enough to describe the dynamics of the ca on the macroscopic level .",
    "while it is of course understandable , that an approximation that considers more information is usually more accurate , we should also relate this conclusion to the computational effort . here",
    ", it turns out that the 2nd - order approximation , although stochastic , i.e. needs to be averaged over a number of runs , performs very fast because of the closed form dynamics .",
    "of course , the 1st - order approximation , the closed form of which is given in the appendix , is computationally even simpler .",
    "but there is a trade - off with the accuracy of the prediction .",
    "still , as long only majority voting is considered , the 1st - order approximation should be preferred , both for simplicity , accuracy and computational effort .",
    "our last remark is about the _ coexistence _ of the two opinions , which is the more interesting scenario compared to _ consensus _ ,",
    "i.e. the existence of only one opinion . here , we are not so much interested in the trivial case of _ random coexistence _ without any structure formation , which is characterized by @xmath141 and @xmath228 .",
