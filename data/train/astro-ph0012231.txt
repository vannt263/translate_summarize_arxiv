    "extragalactic radio sources have been studied for many years , but it is still unclear how they are formed and how they evolve .",
    "a crucial element in the study of their evolution is to identify the young counterparts of ` old ' fanaroff - riley ( fr ) class 1 and 2 extended objects .",
    "recent analyses by fanti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , readhead et al ( @xcite ) , and snellen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that good candidates for young radio sources are the gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources with symmetric morphologies .",
    "they are small in angular size as expected for young sources , and could plausibly expand to larger sizes while decreasing in luminosity as required to match the statistics of the numbers of compact and extended objects .",
    "the propagation velocities of hot - spots in some small size symmetric sources have been measured at a few tenths of the speed of light by owsianik & conway ( @xcite ) and tschager et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; these velocities indicate dynamic ages of a few hundred to a few thousand years . in a few objects we see both a gps or css component associated with the nucleus of the galaxy and extended fr1 or fr2 lobes either side of the nucleus .",
    "these sources with recurrent activity provide us with case studies of the evolution of individual objects which constrain models for the evolution of radio sources in general .",
    "one such object is 3c236 .",
    "3c236 is the largest radio source known in the universe and this in itself makes the source a powerful laboratory for the study of radio source evolution .",
    "the remarkable agreement between the orientation of the inner and outer radio structure was one of the original arguments that a massive black hole was the source of the agn energy .",
    "its angular extent of 39 arcmin corresponds to a projected size of 3.9 mpc at the redshift of its associated 17@xmath6 galaxy ( @xmath7 , hill et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath8  kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "its total radio luminosity of @xmath9  ergs@xmath3 ( mack et al .",

    "its morphology is also intermediate between fr1 and fr2 on large scales ( strom et al .",

    "@xcite ) with a component coincident with the nucleus of the galaxy and two lobes of quite different morphology , one ( se ) narrow and edge - brightened ( fr2-like ) and clearly connected to the nucleus by a low surface brightness jet visible in wsrt 92 cm data ( mack et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the other ( nw ) more diffuse and centre - brightened ( fr1-like ) and extended towards the nucleus but not obviously by a narrow jet .",
    "spectral index studies at wavelengths from 92 to 2.8 cm by mack et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that the spectral index in the nw and se lobes gradually steepens from the edge of each lobe back towards the nucleus ; in addition , the spectral index in the nw lobe is generally steeper than in the se lobe .",
    "about two - thirds of the total luminosity originates in the steep spectrum ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) nuclear component .",
    "earlier high resolution studies ( fomalont & miley @xcite ; schilizzi et al .",
    "@xcite ) have shown its overall size to be 1.3 arcsec corresponding to 2.2 kpc , with an asymmetric morphology ( barthel et al .",
    "@xcite ) which is similar in some respects to that on the larger scale .",

    "( @xcite ) with the vla and mapped in detail with the vlba by conway & schilizzi ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high angular resolution results show that most of the absorption takes place about 400 pc from the nucleus at the tip of the se jet , and is possibly due to a jet - cloud interaction .",
    "hst / wfpc-2 observations of 3c236 by de koff et al .",
    "( @xcite ) revealed the presence of a dust ring in the nucleus @xmath12  kpc in diameter and oriented perpendicular to the overall radio axis .",
    "in addition , a dust lane was observed on scales of 1 kpc seemingly connected to the dust disk by a strand of dust going from one to the other .",
    "3c236 is unusually bright at fir wavelengths ( he s et al .",
    "@xcite , willott et al .",
    "@xcite ) which implies that there is warm dust in the interstellar medium , presumably the dust seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "recent paper by odea et al .",
    "( @xcite ) presents hst stis / mama near - uv observations of the nucleus of 3c236 .",
    "four star - forming regions are found in an arc along the edge of the dust lane .",
    "the age of 3c236 is quite uncertain .",
    "an analysis of the energy and magnetic field content of the large scale lobes by mack et al .",
    "( @xcite ) led to a maximum age for particles in the source of @xmath13  years ( for the hotspot at the end of the se lobe ) . on the other hand , assuming an average propagation speed for the hotspot in the se lobe of @xmath14 ( lacey & cole @xcite , scheuer @xcite ) , the age of 3c236 is @xmath15  years .",
    "reacceleration at the hotspot or resupply of electrons to the hotspot via a jet is therefore necessary unless the speed of propagation is an order of magnitude greater than @xmath14 .",

    "global vlbi observations of 3c236 were carried out at 1.663 ghz in september 1984 using telescopes at 16 locations : jodrell bank ( 25  m mk2 telescope ) , cambridge  ( 15  m ) , defford  ( 25  m ) , westerbork-1 ( one 25  m telescope from the array ) , effelsberg  ( 100  m ) , onsala  ( 25  m ) , simeiz  ( 22  m ) , iowa  ( 18  m ) , haystack   ( 36  m ) , maryland point  ( 25  m ) , green bank  ( 43  m ) , penticton  ( 26  m ) , vla-27 ( twenty seven 25  m telescopes ) , fort davis  ( 25  m ) , owens valley  ( 40  m ) , and hat creek  ( 25  m ) .",

    "the 4.987  ghz data were recorded with mk3 equipment in mode  b ( 28  mhz bandwidth ) and correlated at the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie in bonn .",
    "an important addition to the aperture plane coverage for 3c236 was made by adding merlin data obtained at the same frequency but at a different epoch to the vlbi data .",
    "observations at 1.658 ghz were made with seven merlin telescopes in september 1993 , and at 4.996 ghz with six telescopes in september 1991 . in combining the vlbi and merlin datasets , we assume that the structure does not vary between the epochs of observation , and that the small scaling errors caused by combination of data at slightly different frequencies is acceptable . in particular , we assume that the 1 - 2% variations in the flux density of the central compact component seen at 5 ghz over a period of 8 years ( see sect . 3.2 ) have a negligible effect on the matching of the merlin and vlbi data taken 2 years apart .",
    "the phase centres of the vlbi and merlin dataset were originally matched ( schilizzi et al .",
    "@xcite ) by assuming that the peak emission in the merlin image coincided with component b2 in the vlbi data ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . there were no common baselines to verify this assumption .",
    "however , the vlba image at 1292  mhz of conway & schilizzi ( @xcite ) showed that this assumption is incorrect and that the phase centre of the merlin data should coincide with the centre of component c in the vlbi data .",

    "components b1 , b2 , and c are more clearly defined in fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] . the brightest and most compact component , b2 ,",
    "was earlier identified as the location of the nucleus of 3c236 on the basis of its spectral index and compactness ( schilizzi et al .",
    "component b1 is a slightly resolved knot in the jet to the nw , and component c appears to be a lobe with a bright spine which defines the radio jet to the se .",
    "the overall radio axis defining the long term orientation of the source is given by the line joining the prominent features in the large scale extended lobes and passing through the nuclear component ; this has a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath21 ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "@xcite , see also fig .  [",
    "fig . 9 ] ) .",
    "not all the individual components in the 2 kpc radio structure lie on this line .",
    "one that does is the slightly resolved component b1 which lies 77 mas north - west of b2 in p.a .",
    "@xmath22 . in contrast",
    ", the main ridge line of the lobe - like component c on the other side of b2 , lies in p.a .",
    "the most prominent feature in component a is about 720 mas from b2 and located north of the overall source axis .",
    "weak emission features are seen between this feature and the b1b2c complex which probably delineate the path of the jet to the north - west .",
    "closer to the nucleus , b2 , the jets appear to oscillate in direction ; the initial direction of the jets emanating from b2 to the northwest and south - east is in p.a . @xmath24 before changing smoothly to a p.a .",
    "of @xmath25 about 50 mas from b2 and back again to @xmath26 mid - way through component c. these observations suggest that the jets emanating from b2 oscillate in direction within a cone of half angle @xmath27 .",
    "note that the brightness of the jets close to b2 are very similar ( fig .",
    "the transverse structure in component c which lies 137 mas south east of b2 may be evidence of a shock propagating back through the lobe emission ( barthel et al .",

    "( @xcite ) is @xmath28  ergs@xmath3 assuming an upper limit of 100 ghz to the radio window .",
    "in contrast , on the smaller linear scales , the jet power is @xmath29  ergs@xmath3 with the same upper limit to the radio emission .",
    "this may indicate that the nucleus was more active in the past when the outer lobes were created .",
    "can we reconcile the symmetric structure seen on @xmath30  mas scales at 1.663 ghz with the one - sided structure seen at 5 ghz on 1 mas scales ?",
    "the hst image ( fig .",
    "9 ] middle ) shows convincingly that 3c236 is @xmath31 from the plane of the sky with the nw jet approaching . for radio",
    "emitting plasma moving along the jets with a bulk motion less than a few tens of percent of the speed of light , no beaming effects should be detectable .",
    "this is consistent with the symmetric morphology seen in the nucleus of the galaxy on 10  20 mas scales ( see fig .  [ fig .",
    "the direction of the one - sided structure on milli - arcsecond scales is consistent with the nw jet being the approaching one , but the brightness of the first component in the jet is @xmath32 times stronger than the noise in the receding jet direction .",
    "this is not consistent with the angle to the line of sight being 60@xmath1 , independent of the magnitude of the bulk velocity ( baum et al .",
    "a boost in intensity of a factor of 50 can be achieved if the compact jet is oriented at 35@xmath1 to the line of sight rather than 60@xmath1 , and the bulk velocity is @xmath33 0.8c .",
    "this implies a substantial change in the orientation of the small scale jet which is perhaps unlikely in view of the long term stability of the large scale jet system .",
    "however , the p.a . of the compact jet on the plane of the sky",
    "is @xmath34 different to the large scale p.a .",
    ", indicating that the jet orientation does change .",
    "a more thorough search for superluminal motion in this structure may be illuminating .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the lack of a counterjet on parsec scales is caused by free - free absorption by ionised gas in the inner region of the gas - dust disk surrounding the black hole .",
    "this is seen on vlbi scales in ngc 4261 ( jones et al .",
    "@xcite ) , cen a ( jones et al @xcite ) , and 3c84 ( walker et al . @xcite ; vermeulen et al @xcite ) . in ngc  4261",
    ", the 1.6  ghz image is symmetric about the nucleus as is the case for 3c236 , but at 8.4  ghz ngc  4261 shows the effects of free - free absorption .",
    "higher frequency observations are required to test this possibility in 3c236 .",
    "the radio structure in the nucleus of the giant radio galaxy , 3c236 , has been investigated using combinations of vlbi and merlin data at 1.663 and 4.987  ghz .",
    "the nuclear structure is dominated by two main complexes of emission whose orientation and separation are in general well aligned with the large scale structure , although differences in the projected p.a .",
    "reach @xmath35 within a few tens of milli - arcseconds either side of the nuclear component indicating that the jets oscillate about the mean direction set by the mpc scale structure .",
    "the nuclear component has been identified by its flatter spectrum and compact size in spectral index distributions made at angular resolutions of 10 and 25 mas .",
    "the emission is one - sided to the north - west on scales of a few milli - arcsconds , but symmetric on scales of a few tens of milli - arcseconds .",
    "re - examination of hst data on 3c236 taken by de koff et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reveals that the normal to the plane of the dust ring in the centre of the galaxy is at @xmath36 to the line of sight and parallel , within 15@xmath1 to 20@xmath1 , to the projected elongation of the radio structure . assuming that the radio axis is parallel to the normal to the dust disk",
    ", we identify the shorter north - west jet as being on the approaching side , and the longer south - east jet as receding .",
    "the true size of 3c236 is therefore 4.5  mpc rather than the 3.9 mpc determined assuming the source is in the plane of the sky .",
    "coincidence , within the astrometric errors , of a dust feature with the compact south - east jet ( component c ) is unlikely to be evidence that the south - east radio jet entrains dust in the first 400  pc after leaving the nucleus , rather that the jet has encountered a cloud of gas and dust which actually shapes the radio component .    the one - sided nuclear radio structure to the north - west",
    "can be explained on the basis of relativistic beaming effects , if the angle to the line of sight is @xmath37 and the bulk motion of the radio emitting plasma is highly relativistic .",
    "however , it is not clear that such a large deviation in angle to the line of sight compared to the large scale structure can be reconciled with the relatively small deviations in projected orientation of the jet system from small to large scales .",
    "if the structure is due to beaming , then we must conclude that the change from one - sided to two - sided emission implies that the angle to the line of sight has reached 60@xmath1 at a separation of @xmath38  mas from the nucleus .",
    "the alternative possibility of free - free absorption of the counter jet needs investigation .    at the resolution of wsrt data at 327 mhz by schoenmakers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the south - east jet appears essentially continuous over a distance of 2.5 mpc from the nucleus to the hotspots , making this the largest jet known in the universe .",
    "it is likely , however , that the central activity is episodic but with a shorter duty cycle than for the double - double galaxies studied by schoenmakers et al .",
    "the current central radio emission in 3c236 is evidence of a recent major burst of radio emission superimposed on a more uniform level of activity , perhaps as a result of subsuming a companion galaxy .",
