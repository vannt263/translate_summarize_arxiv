    "this paper is a tribute to bruce shore s role in establishing the concept of atomic coherence and the related techniques of irreducible tensor operators @xcite .",
    "we demonstate that this viewpoint emerges quite naturally when describing the evolution of a spinor condensate . during the past decade",
    "condensed bose gases have energed as flexible test system to explore the rich structure of many - body physics .",
    "a systematic introduction into cold gases in general and spinor condensates in particular may be found , e.g. , in the book by pethick and smith @xcite . with the development of purely optical traps @xcite",
    ", we are in the position to hold atoms with their complete hyperfine submanifold , thus entering the regime of spinor physics @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the condition under which one expects the techniques of atomic coherence @xcite to be most helpful .",
    "there are two major approximations used in the literature when describing spinor condensates theoretically : the common mean - field approximation ( mf ) and the single mode aproximation ( sma ) . within the sma ,",
    "the spatial dependence of the bose field operator describing the spinor gas is assumed given and decoupled from the internal dynamics , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "the reason one can separate the local redistribution of particles amongst hyperfine sublevels due to collisions from the long range dynamics is clear : a typical trapped alkali atom is paramagnetic , but provides only a single bohr magneton of magnetic moment .",
    "consequently the resulting magnetic dipolar interaction is very weak compared to the typical interactomic van - der - waals energy .",
    "rb condensate in the single - mode approximation.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the single mode approximation is commonly introduced on top of the mean - field approximation .",
    "one exception is the paper by koashi and ueda @xcite where the sma is introduced directly into the many - body treatment ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this , and also neglecting the quadratic zeeman part of the energy , allowed the authors to construct an explicit solution to the problem including collisions . in this paper",
    "we include the quadratic zeeman part which plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the condensate as realized with @xmath2rb or @xmath3na atoms @xcite .",
    "consequently , we are left with an interacting three mode hamiltonian , whose dynamics will be the subject of study in this article .",
    "it should be pointed out that our approach would not apply directly to the recently realised chromium bose - einstein condensate @xcite where the dipolar interaction is comparable to the van - der - waals energy .",
    "even less so in the case of heteronuclear molecules pursued by many experimental groups around the world where the dipolar interaction is expected to be the dominant mechanism .",
    "independence of the internal and spatial motion is completely lifted e.g. in the proposed einstein  de haas effect @xcite .",
    "the sma is obviously not aplicable under the conditions for condensate fragmentation and domain formation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    the article is organized as follows : in section  [ secmanybody ] we review the derivation of the three mode spinor hamiltonian . for later reference",
    ", we will also discuss the standard mean - field approximation in the language of hamiltonian mechanics in section  [ secmf ] . visualizing the results of a full many - body evolution of the three mode system",
    "is a nontrivial problem .",
    "therefore , we introduce the concepts of irreducible tensor operators in section  [ seccohev ] . finally , we discuss and compare the results of the many - body calculation in section  [ secresdisc ] .",
    "the @xmath4 bosons are described in the usual way by a field operator with the three spherical components , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( in this order ) labels the @xmath1 projection of the atomic spin .",
    "the effective low energy hamiltonian of such bosons in a homogeneous magnetic field is written as : ( cf .",

    "this is mainly the linear zeeman effect , @xmath10 , and the quadratic zeeman , or paschen - back , effect , @xmath11 .",
    "the latter is crucial for the purposes of our analyses .",

    "both @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe single - body physics .",

    "this leads to a natural separation of time scales : on smaller time scales , one may neglect @xmath16 , whereas for longer time scales it may be of crucial importance .",
    "the ultimate example of a longer time scale is the ground state of the condensate , which may be polar or ferromagnetic depending on the sign of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "an example of the opposite are experiments where the spinor condensate is prepared in a particular magnetic state , and the evolution of the condensate is then observed @xcite . in this case , an approximation commonly used in the literature is the so - called single mode approximation ( sma ) .",
    "technically , sma is recovered by assuming that the spatial dependence of the field operator is fixed , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . under the sma ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system of @xmath32 spin - one particles becomes : ( cf .",

    "in particular , @xmath40 is the full angular momentum operator , and @xmath41 is the fock - space operators of the total particle number , where @xmath42 is a 3@xmath433 unit matrix . the second line in ( [ eq : hfockspace ] ) is found using that , @xmath44 in numerical terms , constituents of ( [ eq : hfockspace ] ) are sparse matrices ; these are handled very efficiently by common high - level numerical packages .",
    "some details on how these were implemented numerically may be found in appendix [ tofock ] .",
    "in the mean field approximation , operators @xmath45 are replaced by complex numbers @xmath46 . however ,",
    "this transition is not uniquely defined . using different orderings ( normal , symmetric , etc . ) of creation and annihilation operator yields different _ functional forms _ of the quantum hamiltonian . in quantum mechanics",
    "these functional forms represent the same hamiltonian . in the mean field picture where ordering is immaterial for the complex numbers @xmath46",
    ", @xmath47 , these different functional forms result in different classical hamiltonians . in the scalar case ,",
    "the corresponding corrections are of the order of @xmath48 , where @xmath32 is the total number of atoms . for the spinor condensate ,",
    "these corrections are of the order of one over the population of zeeman sublevels .",
    "there can well be pathological cases when one level is much depleted , leading to large corrections .",
    "it is therefore of importance to have the procedure of introducing the mean field approximation for the spinor condensate clearly defined .",
    "there is a number of ways the mean field picture can be introduced .",
    "the most rigorous one is via the phase - space technique ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , where the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation appears on dropping quantum noises in the equations for the phase - space amplitudes .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to using the normally - ordered form of the interaction hamiltonian , replacing the field operators by the c - numbers , and then _ postulating _ the resulting c - number function to be the classical hamiltonian . the lack of rigour is clearly seen in the fact that this procedure leaves it unclear how quantum averages are expressed by the c - number amplitudes .",
    "some insight can be gained from the fact that if we postulate the many body state as a coherent state , @xmath49 , and then minimize the energy subject to the condition @xmath50 , the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation is recovered .",
    "this recipe is in fact general : a correct mean - field expression for the average of an operator @xmath51 is found as @xmath52 .",
    "this is equivalent to replacing field operators by c - numbers in the _ normally ordered representation _ of @xmath51 .      following the above recipe , we postulate the classical hamilton function to be , @xmath53 ,   \\end{aligned}\\label{eq : hamiltonfunction } \\end{aligned}\\]]where ( [ eq : hfockspace ] )",

    "one can verify easily , that this is a proper canonical transform , as @xmath60 with the following conventional definition of the poisson brackets , @xmath61 so we obtain the hamilton equations of motion @xmath62 by employing complex coordinates we have doubled the dimension of the phase space making the two sets of equations of motion redundant .",

    "it is then only natural to introduce effective mean - field amplitudes as eigenvectors of @xmath77 : @xmath78 in general , we have three eigenvectors of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and three related eigenvalues , @xmath81 , @xmath82 . for a mean - field approximation to be recovered , there must exist a dominant eigenvalue , @xmath83 .",
    "below in section  [ secresdisc ] we shall see that it is exactly the situation occuring at early stages of the condensate evolution . at later stages",
    "all three eigenvalues are of the same order of magnitude so that the mean - field approximation breaks down completely .",
    "the physical information contained in the correlations expressed by the single - body density matrix is _ atomic coherence _ @xcite .",
    "a natural framework for discussing such correlations is the picture of irreducible tensor operators @xcite .",
    "an irreducible tensor operator of angular momentum @xmath84 is a set of @xmath85 square matrices , @xmath86 , @xmath87 . under three dimensional rotations ,",
    "they obey the same transfomation laws as spherical harmonics @xmath88 , thus forming a natural basis for expressing any physical quantity with angular momentum @xmath84 .",

    "if at a particular time magnetisation vanishes , the mean field picture predicts that the system must be axially symmetric .",
    "hence , under the sma , absence of axial symmetry at zero magnetisation is a clear signature of many - body effects .",
    "since thermalisation via symmetric collisions can only increase the symmetry of the system , it appears plausible that this statement should survive beyond the sma . verifying this conjecture is subject to further analysis .",
    "the choice of the basis in the fock space is inherently linked to the angular - momentum properties of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hfockspace ] ) .",
    "a native bookkeeping is to introduce the basis states by the populations of the single - particle states with @xmath136 . by construction ,",

    "since @xmath143 commutes with @xmath138 and @xmath139 , states with different @xmath32 s ans @xmath144 s are not mixed by free evolution .",
    "another simplification when using this `` natural '' basis is the ease with which the many - body operators are implemented ( appendix [ tofock ] ) .    in the absence of the quadratic zeeman effect ( qze ) ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq : hfockspace ] ) conserves the full angular momentum , @xmath145 , and its component , @xmath146 . in this case",
    "the time evolution is solved @xcite by simply classifying the basis states by the eigenvalues of the three operators : @xmath147here , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",

    ", @xmath151 is not a good quantum number any more , while @xmath144 is still conserved .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq : hfockspace ] ) can then be diagonalised within subspaces of given @xmath144 of the `` natural '' basis .",
    "conversely , rotating the states by the radio - frequency field as in ref .",
    "@xcite conserves @xmath151 while mixing different @xmath144 s . using the `` angular momentum '' basis",

    "the condensate is firstly prepared in a state where all atomic spins are antiparallel to the @xmath1 axis .",
    "a radio - frequency pulse is then used to re - orient the spins antiparallel to the @xmath131 axis . in our notation , this state looks as @xmath152where @xmath153 . since the manifold of @xmath154 is non - degenerate , @xmath155 is also an eigenstate of the total angular momentum , @xmath156 . furthermore , since the evolution does not mix different @xmath144 s , @xmath155 must be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , providing us with a test of numerics .",

    "a much more convenient way is thinking in terms of the _ alignment ellipsoid_. the latter is found by diagonalising the real part of the density matrix , cf .",
    "( [ eq : rhobyref ] ) .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath103 are the alignment axes .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath103 are positive , their sum equals population , @xmath182 , and differences between them characterise alignment . in particular , three equal eigenvalues , @xmath183 , mean the atomic state has no alignment at all .",
    "the system of three orthogonal eigenvectors and three positive eigenvalues is naturally visualised as a three - dimensional ellipsoid .",
    "if we additionally shift the centre of this alignment ellipsoid by the magnetisation vector , the resulting picture contains all details of the atomic coherence , cf .",

    "an additional simplification is that the smallest axis of the ellipsoid was always found to be collinear with the magnetisation vector .",
    "this also holds if @xmath184 when the whole picture is subject to the larmor precession .",
    "thus the only parameter we need in order to fully specify the orientation of the alignment ellipsoid is the tilt angle ; the latter is defined as the angle between the largest axis of the ellipsoid and the quantisation ( @xmath1 ) axis . together with the eigenvalues of @xmath185 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : rhobyref ] ) ] and the magnetisation vector , this angle completes characterisation of the atomic coherence .",

    "[ fig : q ] . at early stages of the evolution ,",
    "the mean field picture holds with a very good accuracy . in the mean field approximation",
    ", the alignment ellipsoid reduces to a flat ellips orthogonal to the magnetisation vector .",
    "there are two characteristic moments of the mean - field evolution [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : fmeanf ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] , top row ] .",
    "if the magnetisation is maximal , the alignment axis are equal ; the alignment ellipsoid becomes a disk ( fig .",

    "if the magnetisation is zero , only one alignment eigenvalue is nonzero ; the alignment ellipsoid reduces to a straight line at @xmath181 tilt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] , top - right ) .",
    "the mean - field evolution of the atomic coherence is in essence periodic oscillations between these charateristic configurations .",
    "on later stages of the evolution the mean field picture breaks down .",
    "all three eigenvalues of @xmath103 are nonzero , so that the alignment ellipsoid acquires thickness , becoming an ellipsoid proper ( fig .",
    "[ fig : visual ] , bottom - left ) .",
    "the tilt oscillations are damped and finally cease ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] ) .",
    "the final state of atomic coherence is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : visual ] , bottom - right .",
    "the magnetisation is zero so that the ellipsoid is centered at the centre of coordinates .",
    "the larger axis is along @xmath1 , the other two are equal so that the alignment ellipsoid is axially symmetric .",
    "this state of atomic symmetry is impossible to obtain in the mean - field picture .",
    "thus in the course of the evolution atomic coherence undergoes a complete change of symmetry .",
    "initially , the system is prepared in an axially symmetric state in respect of the @xmath131 axis . at intermediate stages of the evolution ,",
    "all symmetries are broken .",
    "finally , the system again tends towards an axial symmetry .",
    "not unexpectedly , the final symmetry coinsides with the dynamical symmetry , with the symmetry axis parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "we have modelled the quantum many - body dynamics of a spin-1 condensate numerically within a single mode approximation , using the representation of irreducible tensor operators so as to conveniently visualise the condensate evolution .",
    "comparing results of the numerical simulation to those obtained within the mean field approximation shows a number of characteristic features of the many - body evolution which are impossible to obtain under the mean field approximation .",
    "in particular , the final state of the condensate coherence is of a characteristic quadrupole nature , axially symmetric in respect of the quantisation axes , whereas this kind of atomic coherence is impossible in principle in the mean field approximation .",
    "experimentally observing this state of atomic coherence would be a distinct signature of spin - mixing collisions without the mean - field approximation .",

    "to be specific , consider how mode annihilation operators , @xmath186 , are implemented in a high - level numerical package .",
    "such packages handle sparse rectangular matrices very effectively , so the first step is to replace a triple index , @xmath187 , characterising a basis state in the fock space , by a linear index .",
    "a helpful trick is to start from introducing an extended index , @xmath188 , where @xmath189 .",
    "the third index , @xmath190 , is found from @xmath191 .",
    "each value of the extended index , @xmath192 , thus corresponds to a unique triple , @xmath193this includes nonphysical entries with @xmath194 which are to be filtered out later .",
    "the advantage of using the extended indexing is that , as a rule , many - body operators written in the extended index are simple banded matrices .",
    "for example , if @xmath195 , @xmath196that is , in the extended index , @xmath197 and @xmath198 are sparse matrices with a single nonzero side diagonal . generating such matrices numerically is straightforward ;",
    "@xmath199 which is not found in such simple way can then be obtained by a suitable permutation of rows and columns of @xmath197 ( say ) . in the matrices",
    "generated using ( [ eq : amatr ] ) one should retain only columns for which @xmath200 and rows for which @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "( recall that @xmath186 acts from the subspace of @xmath32 atoms into the subspace of @xmath203 atoms . )",
    "this is equivalent to building a `` physical '' linear index , changing @xmath204 first , and @xmath205second , while watching for the condition @xmath206 ; however the property of having a single nonzero side diagonal does not hold for the physical indexing .",
    "generalisation to higher - order spin values is straightforward .",
    "there is a further subtlety in how products of field operators are implemented numerically .",
    "an unwanted by - product of introducing field operators is a formal non - conservation of the particle number .",
    "we wish to restrict ourselves to a subspace of given @xmath32 and introduce annihilation operators as acting from this subspace into the subspace of @xmath203 atoms .",
    "then , only bilinear normally ordered operator products , @xmath207 , are immediately defined for numerical purposes . viewed literally , quartic normally ordered operators products [ cf .  the first line of ( [ eq : hfockspace ] ) ] imply knowledge of the field operators acting from the subspace of @xmath203 atoms into the subspace of @xmath208 atoms and hence can not be implemented under this restriction .",
    "the solution to this problem is obvious : use commutation relations .",
    "so , with @xmath209 being the unit matrix in the subspace of @xmath32 atoms , @xmath210 etc .",
    "also the second line of ( [ eq : hfockspace ] ) ] .",
    "equations ( [ eq : commnum ] ) hold in the complete fock space , but only their right - hand sides make numerical sense under the above restriction .",
