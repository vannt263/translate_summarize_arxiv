    "historically , the opening up of the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the narrow visible region has always led to a deeper understanding of physical phenomena . nowhere is this currently more evident than in the mid - infrared ( mir ) regime where the combination of vastly superior sensitivity and spatial resolution afforded by the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , compared to previous infrared ( ir ) satellites , has transformed the study of extragalactic point sources .",
    "ground - based mir studies of supernovae ( sne ) are extremely challenging  if not impossible  even from the highest - altitude facilities .",
    "this is due to a combination of conspiring factors : strong terrestrial atmospheric absorption , generally high background in the mir , and the faintness of mir emission from sne at epochs of interest .",
    "currently , one of the most persistent questions relating to sn research is whether core - collapse sne could be major contributors to the universal dust budget .",
    "although this was suggested about 40 years ago @xcite , attempts to verify this hypothesis observationally have , until recently , remained few and far between .",
    "this has been partly due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation , and partly because , given the large amounts of dust produced in the winds of low - mass stars in the local universe , the notion that sne might produce significant dust was not widely explored . however , evidence in favor of enormous amounts of dust ( @xmath1 ) in galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath2 ) is mounting , and comes from a variety of observations such as sub - mm observations of the most distant quasars @xcite , obscuration by dust of quasars in damped ly-@xmath3 systems ( dlas ) @xcite , and measurements of metal abundances in dlas @xcite . the existence of large amounts of dust when the universe was relatively youthful poses problems for a low - mass star origin of dust , since the main - sequence evolution timescales of these stars ( up to 1gyr ) begin to become comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "sne arising from short - lived population iii stars could be a viable alternative .",
    "although estimates of the amount of dust produced per supernova are sensitive to the choice of initial mass function and grain destruction efficiencies , the current consensus is that each sn need only produce 0.11@xmath4 of dust to account for the high - redshift observations @xcite .",
    "however , for the handful of recent sne for which dust - mass estimates exist , these invariably fall short of the amounts cited above by 23 orders of magnitude .",
    "there are at least two direct methods for inferring the presence of dust in the ejecta of recent sne .",
    "the first relies on the attenuation of the red wings of optical or near - infrared ( nir ) ejecta lines during the nebular phase , betraying the presence of new dust that has condensed in the ejecta .",
    "the signature is usually pronounced , and has not yet been attributed to any other effect . while this method has been used to infer the presence of freshly formed dust , quantitative information on the amount , composition , and geometry has remained elusive .",
    "the other method is to observe the thermal emission from dust grains .",
    "although over a dozen sne have exhibited nir excesses , the challenge so far has been to distinguish between pre - existing circumstellar dust heated by the sn , and new dust condensing in the ejecta . the former scenario ( i.e. , the ir echo ) predicts a distinctive flat - topped light - curve shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus providing one means by which to differentiate between the two cases .",
    "the ideal observational requirement for this method to work is that of a long time - series of mir data . additionally , multi - wavelength mir data provide information on the evolution of the spectral energy distribution , thereby constraining the dust temperature , emissivity , and geometry .    in the case of sn  1987a ,",
    "both techniques were employed . however ,",
    "even the highest value obtained was only @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the attenuation method to infer a dust mass exceeding @xmath6  m@xmath7 in the type  iin sn  1998s .",
    "however , such events are relatively rare . for the type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) supernova sn  1999em",
    ", @xcite used the attenuation method to obtain a lower limit to the dust mass of just @xmath8 .",
    "more recently , using _ spitzer _",
    "observations , the thermal - emission approach has been applied to the type ii sn  2003gd .",
    "@xcite found that the mir flux at about 16  months was consistent with emission from just @xmath9 of newly condensed dust in the ejecta .",
    "they also showed that the claim by @xcite of a much larger mass of new dust at a later epoch was unsupported by the data .",
    "evidence for dust condensation in sn ejecta may also be acquired via the study of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "however , mir and far - ir ( fir ) studies of snrs have tended to find low dust masses .",
    "for example , for the cassiopeia  a snr , @xcite used _",
    "images at 24  @xmath10 m and 70  @xmath10 m together with other data to deduce a dust mass of @xmath11 at around 80  k in cas  a. from _ spitzer _ spectroscopy , @xcite deduce a factor of 10 larger dust mass , and suggest that the difference is due to their use of additional grain compositions necessary to fit the spectra .",
    "three studies based on _ spitzer _ data of the young snr 1e 0102.27219 reveal dust masses that vary by roughly two orders of magnitude : @xcite find no more than @xmath12 of dust at @xmath13120  k associated with the remnant , while @xcite and @xcite derive dust masses of @xmath11 at about 70  k , and @xmath14 of dust at @xmath1360  k , respectively",
    ". estimates for the crab and kepler s snrs based on _ spitzer _ mir data are similar , with @xmath15  m@xmath16 of dust for the former by @xcite , and @xmath11 at @xmath1385  k for the latter by @xcite .",
    "thus , the bulk of mir / fir studies of snrs yield dust masses which are at least a factor of 10 less than the _ minimum _ required to account for the high - redshift dust .",
    "it is possible that most of the snr dust is very cold ( @xmath1730  k ) and hence has escaped detection in these studies .",
    "attempts have been made to detect very cold dust using sub - mm measurements of the cas  a and kepler snrs .",
    "observations by @xcite using _ scuba _ led them to claim that at least 2  m@xmath16 of dust formed in the supernova , with their model including a dust component at 18  k. however , @xcite used the same data together with observations from _",
    "spitzer _ to show that most of the emission originates from a line - of - sight molecular cloud , and not from dust formed in cas  a. nevertheless , in a recent study of 850  @xmath10 m polarization in cas  a , @xcite still estimate a dust mass of @xmath131m@xmath16 .",
    "however , this estimate is subject to significant uncertainties in 850  @xmath10 m emissivity as well as in grain alignment and morphology .",
    "in particular , they point out that iron @xcite or graphite needles could reduce the dust mass required to explain the sub - mm observations . for the kepler snr",
    ", @xcite used _",
    "scuba _ to infer a dust mass of @xmath18 , where the model fit included a dust component at 17  k. however , they subsequently revised this dust mass downward by a factor of two in the sub - mm study of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that , so far , the direct sub - mm evidence in favor of large masses of ejecta dust is relatively weak . on the other hand ,",
    "several studies have highlighted the destruction of dust grains by the reverse shock as the supernova ejecta crashes into the ambient medium and makes the transition into the remnant phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the dust masses that condense in sn ejecta at early epochs ( few years ) should be several times higher than during the remnant phase .",
    "all of the above findings have rekindled the debate regarding the role of sne as dust producers , and vigorous efforts are underway to address this question .    _",
    "spitzer s _ coverage of the likely peak of thermal emission due to dust , together with the availability of flexible scheduling of observations , provided an opportunity to test the sn ejecta dust - condensation hypothesis , at least for local supernovae .",
    "we have therefore been pursuing a campaign of mir observations for a sample of core - collapse sne within the framework of the mid - infrared supernova consortium ( misc ) .",
    "fortuitously , there have been several nearby supernovae since the launch of _ spitzer _ in 2003 , which have also been well monitored at other wavelengths . in @xcite",
    "we reported early results on sn  2004dj , the first mir observations of sn ejecta since those of sn  1987a . _",
    "spitzer _ studies by @xcite and @xcite of the type  ii - p sn  2002hh revealed the complicated nature of its surroundings .",
    "however , both sets of authors concluded that the mir flux from this sn was dominated by emission from a dusty circumstellar medium ( csm ) or nearby molecular cloud , driven by the sn luminosity .",
    "this radiation swamped any prospects of detecting newly formed ejecta dust in this case .    in what follows",
    "we present the most extensive mir dataset of any sn to date , surpassed only in the timespan of observations by the type  ii - pec sn  1987a , which has been observed at mir wavelengths as late as 18 years after explosion @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be argued that since sn  2004et is of type  ii - p , the most common of all core - collapse sn types , the mir work presented here is of particular relevance to the general understanding of the role played by sne in the formation of dust grains .",
    "sn  2004et was discovered on 2004 sep .",
    "22.98 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by s. moretti @xcite and is the eighth supernova to occur in ngc  6946 since 1917 .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt an explosion date ( epoch 0  days ) of 2004 sep .",
    "22.0 ( mjd = jd-2400000.5 = 53270.0 ) .",
    "the distance to ngc  6946 has been estimated using several different techniques . however , as pointed out by @xcite , the uncertainty is large . for consistency with our earlier work on sn  2002hh in the same host galaxy @xcite a distance of 5.9  mpc",
    "is adopted @xcite . soon after discovery",
    ", the sn was spectrally classified as a young type  ii - p sn , exhibiting characteristic broad p  cygni profiles in the balmer lines @xcite .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic monitoring programs began in earnest soon thereafter .",
    "results from optical monitoring are summarized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "based on pre - explosion imaging , @xcite suggested a yellow supergiant as a candidate progenitor for sn  2004et .",
    "this has since been challenged by @xcite , who show that the point source seen in ground - based images comprises at least three separate sources .",
    "they argue that the true progenitor is actually an m - type red supergiant .",
    "x - ray @xcite and radio @xcite observations at early times have revealed the presence of a progenitor wind rendered detectable through the impact of the fastest - moving ejecta .",
    "sn 2004et was observed using the full suite of _ spitzer _ instrumentation .",
    "images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath10 m were obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ) , at 16 and 22@xmath10 m with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) peak - up array ( pui ) , and at 24@xmath10 m with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) .",
    "spectra between 5.2 and 37  @xmath10 m were acquired with the irs in low - resolution mode .",
    "imaging observations spanned epochs 64.7 to 1406.0  days .",
    "these observations were drawn from a number of programs in addition to our own , and are catalogued in table [ tab : phot ] .",
    "several pre- and post - explosion 3.6  @xmath10 m irac images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we used the post - basic calibrated data ( pbcd ) products provided by the _ spitzer _ pipeline .",
    "the serendipitous pre - explosion irac and mips images from the sings program showed evidence for spatially extended emission at and near the location of the supernova .",
    "we therefore subtracted these `` templates '' from all epochs of post - explosion imaging before proceeding with our flux measurements .",
    "the image matching and subtraction was performed as implemented in the isis v2.2 image subtraction package @xcite , and modified in a manner analogous to that described by @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the background - subtracted irac and mips images using the starlink package gaia @xcite .",
    "a circular aperture of radius 5@xmath19 was used for the photometry .",
    "this was chosen as a compromise between minimizing the effects of the residual ridge emission at the sn location at late epochs in the irac and mips data , and minimizing the the size of aperture correction needed in the final flux determination .",
    "the aperture radius corresponds to a distance of @xmath13145  pc at sn  2004et .",
    "residual background in the template - subtracted irac and mips images was measured and subtracted by using a clipped mean sky estimator , and a concentric sky annulus having inner and outer radii of 1.5 and 2 times the aperture radius , respectively .",
    "aperture corrections were derived from the irac and mips point - response function frames available from the _ spitzer science center _ , and ranged from a factor of 1.08 at 3.6@xmath10 m to a factor of 2.12 at 24@xmath10 m .",
    "fluxing errors due to uncertainties in the aperture corrections are about @xmath20 . at earlier epochs",
    "the aperture was centered by centroiding on the sn image . at later epochs , when the supernova was faint , the aperture was centered using the wcs coordinates , with the sn position given by the radio observation of @xcite .    for the pui images ( 16 and 22@xmath10 m ) , no pre - explosion data were available .",
    "we carried out standard aperture photometry on the pbcd images using the same sizes of aperture and annulus as for the irac and mips measurements .",
    "the residual background was then estimated as follows . using the same aperture and sky annulus , we measured the net fluxes at the sn location in the pre - explosion irac and mips images ( see table  [ tab : phot ] ) .",
    "the residual background at 16 and 22@xmath10 m was then found by blackbody interpolation between the irac and mips wavelengths and subtracted from the previously measured pui fluxes .",
    "the resulting sn photometric measurements are listed in table [ tab : phot ] and displayed as light curves in fig .",
    "the uncertainties shown are statistical only",
    ".      low - resolution ( @xmath21127 ) mir spectroscopy of sn  2004et covered seven epochs between 294 and 1385  days , and was obtained using the short - low ( sl ; 5.214.5@xmath10 m ) and long - low ( ll ; 1438@xmath10 m ) modules of the infrared spectrograph ( irs * ? ? ?",
    "the log of observations is given in table  [ tab : speclog ] .",
    "we began our reduction of the sl and ll spectra with the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames .",
    "starting with these frames , we first subtracted the sky background by differencing between the two nod positions . all subsequent steps ( extraction , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration )",
    "were carried out using the optimal extraction mode of the _ spitzer _ custom extractor tool , spice . given the faintness of the target by day  1212",
    ", we also experimented with subtracting the sky background by differencing between the adjacent order and carrying out subsequent extraction steps using the spectroscopic modeling , analysis , and reduction tool ( smart ) .",
    "we found the two extractions to be consistent but with the latter producing a cleaner spectrum , so we used this extraction . a possible reason for this difference may be that order - order sky subtraction is more suited for removing background emission when the background is high and variable ; see below .    despite this careful reduction procedure , the fluxes of the irs spectra and the irac photometry were not completely consistent .",
    "the main problem was that the sn lay on a ridge of emission in the host galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "while this could be removed for the irac and mips images using the template method described above , such a technique was not possible for the spectra .",
    "furthermore , this problem was aggravated by differences in the fixed sizes of the spectrograph aperture slits and the circular apertures used for the image photometry .",
    "an additional , though smaller , problem was that the spectra were generally taken a few days before or after the images , during which time the sn flux changed .    in order to correct for these difficulties , we calibrated the irs spectra against nearly contemporary photometry in the 8  @xmath10 m band , chosen since it was completely spanned by the short - low ( sl ) spectrum .",
    "the irac 8  @xmath10 m transmission function was multiplied by the mir spectra and by a model spectrum of vega .",
    "the resulting mir spectra for the sn and for vega were integrated over wavelength and compared .",
    "hence , the total sn spectral fluxes in the 8  @xmath10 m band were derived .",
    "these were then compared with the temporally nearest 8  @xmath10 m photometry to derive scaling factors by which the spectra were multiplied .",
    "correction factors were , respectively , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for sl spectra at 294 , 349 , 450 , 481 , 823 , 1212 and 1385  days , respectively .",
    "the irac photometry epochs to which these spectra were scaled were 300 , 360 , 464 , 464 , 795 , 1222 and 1395  days , respectively .",
    "the bulk of the corrections was due to errors in the original spectral flux calibration .",
    "apart from the 823  day spectrumm flux and the consequent difficulty of reliably correcting for the strong , complex background even after template subtraction , we decided to scale the day  823 spectrum to day  795 when the sn was considerably brighter .",
    "] , only a small part of these corrections was due to the shift from the spectral epochs to the contemporary photometry epochs .",
    "the large correction at day  823 may have been due to the faint sn flux around this time and the consequently strong effect of the residual ridge emission .",
    "we did not detect the source in sl order 2 on day  1212 , so the spectrum only covered about 2/3 of the 8  @xmath10 m irac band . within this restriction , we found that the spectrum provided a match to the 1222  day photometry without any scaling .    for five of the spectral epochs ( 294 , 349 , 450 , 1212 and 1385  days ) , usable contemporary long - low ( ll ) spectra , typically spanning @xmath131430  @xmath10 m ,",
    "were also available .",
    "the first three had a small overlap with the sl spectra in the 14  @xmath10 m region .",
    "these were scaled to bring them into agreement with the sl spectra in this region .",
    "the ll correction factors were , respectively , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "no sl - ll overlap was available for spectral epochs 1212 and 1385  days .",
    "instead , theses spectra were compared with contemporary 24  @xmath10 m fluxes obtained with mips . for day  1212",
    "the 1421.3  @xmath10 m portion required no correction to provide a match to the photometry .",
    "the 19.635  @xmath10 m portion was scaled by a factor of 0.75 to match the overlap with the shorter wavelength section . for day  1385",
    "the ll portion was scaled by @xmath32 to match the contemporary photometry .",
    "the spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "note that , while the epoch labels shown in fig . [ fig3 ] correspond to the original spectroscopic ones , the respective spectra have been scaled , via the above procedure , to match contemporary photometry .",
    "these corrections are important for the analysis below which makes use of both the spectra and the photometry . the day  481 spectrum was not used in the analysis below .",

    "consequently the velocities correspond to the smallest possible source radii consistent with the cool component sed .",
    "yet the required velocities are still too large for the source to be attributable to ejecta dust .",
    "also , again since these are blackbody matches , these results are independent of the nature of the dust .",
    "furthermore , there is currently no known mechanism by which newly formed ejecta dust rapidly cools , leaving behind only a small warm component that is amenable to detection at mir wavelengths . nor is it clear that such a scenario could be made to be consistent with the optical depths indicated by the mir spectra .",
    "we propose instead that , at least up to day  795 , the cold component arose from dust whose existence preceded the supernova explosion .",
    "the obvious mechanism for this radiation is an ir echo .",

    "here we represent both effects using a single hot blackbody , as before .",
    "the hot blackbody was adjusted to match the underlying continuum of the optical spectrum as discussed above .",
    "the free parameters were blackbody radius ( usually introduced as epoch and velocity ) and temperature .    for the warm component , we note from the blackbody study that in the period 300795  days , the ir emission is consistent with an origin in newly condensed ejecta dust , heated by radioactive decay .",
    "however , an alternative source could be dust in the progenitor wind ( i.e. , an ir echo ) , and we first examine this possibility . comparison with ir echo models @xcite suggests that the warm component could indeed be due to reradiation of the sn flux from pre - existing circumstellar dust . for a dust - free cavity formed by evaporation by the sn peak flux , over a range of csm density profiles ( @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) , we find that the echo model light curve actually declines too rapidly . however , if we increase the cavity size by a factor of @xmath59 , then the ir echo model can reproduce the characteristic dust temperature and sed decline over the 300795  days period .",
    "such a large cavity would have to be the result of the episodic mass - loss history of the progenitor .",
    "the problem with this scenario is the _ ad hoc _ nature of the `` fine tuning '' of the cavity size required to make it work .",
    "there is no independent evidence to support the occurrence of a mass - loss event which yielded a cavity of just the right size to account for the warm - component behavior and support the ir  echo scenario . on the contrary ,",
    "@xcite argue that line shifts to the blue in their late - time optical spectra imply dust formation in the ejecta .",
    "we have independently reexamined their spectra . in the [ o  i ]  @xmath366300 line",
    "we find that during days  314465 the red wing shifts by about 800  to the blue while the blue wing is unmoved .",
    "we therefore agree with @xcite that this is evidence of dust condensation in the ejecta .",
    "profiles , also presented by @xcite , between days  301 and 314 we find a jump of @xmath60  in the whole profile , but little sign of a progressive blueshift in the subsequent day  314465 period . during this period",
    "the shift remained at about @xmath61  ( corrected for the redshift of ngc  6946 ) .",
    "we suggest that this could simply be due to the peculiar velocity of the supernova center of mass .",
    "we have no explanation for the sudden day  301314 jump . nor",
    "do we see the `` flattening '' in the profile reported by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that there is little evidence of a progressive blueshift in the h@xmath3 line .",
    "however , given the highly extended nature of the hydrogen envelope , dust formed in the much smaller refractory - element zone of the sn would be unlikely to produce a significant modification of the profile , except perhaps a truncation of the extreme red wing . ]",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite found that in the period 310370  days the rate of decline in the optical light curves accelerated .",
    "such behavior is also suggestive of dust condensation in the ejecta , although alternative explanations for the steepening are ( a ) increasing transparency of the expanding ejecta to the gamma rays from the radioactive decay , or ( b ) the onset of the ir catastrophe . nevertheless , taken with the [ o  i ]  @xmath366300 blueshift and the necessarily specific selection of the cavity radius for the ir - echo model to work ,",
    "we conclude that the warm component during days  300795 was most likely due to newly formed , radioactively - heated dust in the ejecta .",
    "we also note that no detectable ir echo would be expected from a dusty cool dense shell ( cds ; see below ) , since the cds would not have formed until long after the bulk of the sn uv / optical flux had passed .",

    "consequently , a cold component had to be included .",
    "similar to the earlier blackbody study , we found that for the period 300795  days the cold - component flux could be reproduced with a blackbody at @xmath13110  k , radius @xmath62  cm , and luminosity @xmath63  ergs s@xmath64 .",

    "the required blackbody radius at a given epoch would require velocities as high as 12000 , far greater than the velocities of the fastest moving refractory elements .",
    "we therefore invoked an ir echo from pre - existing dust to account for the cold component .",
    "this was based on the ir  echo model of @xcite , and will be described in detail below .    to select the likely grain density distribution and grain materials for the idm , we were guided by dust condensation calculations and the explosion models upon which they are based .",

    "qualitatively similar results are reported for jet - driven explosions of red supergiants by @xcite .",
    "how this affects the dust distribution has yet to be determined .",

    "the coexistence of sio and silicates is not surprising since sio formation is an essential step in the silicate - formation sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "no sio was added to the amorphous carbon version of our model .    in order to reproduce the fading visibility of the silicate feature during the 300464  day period , it was necessary to increase the optical depth .",
    "we found that @xmath84 of silicate grains plus a few @xmath85 of sio provided good matches to the mir continua .",

    "the dust temperature fell from @xmath87  k to @xmath88  k. even as early as day  300 , the optical depth to the center at 10  @xmath10 m ( @xmath89 ) had to be set as high as 2.8 in order to reduce the silicate feature to the observed visibility . by day  464",
    "the optical depth had increased to 3.6 .",
    "also , the dust mass had grown to @xmath90  m@xmath7 .",
    "an interesting point about the mass estimates is that the silicate feature yields an additional constraint on the model at each epoch since the optical depth had to be adjusted to match the visibility of the observed 814  @xmath10 m feature .",
    "consequently , in spite of the high optical depth , within the uniformity limitation of the model the derived dust masses are actual values rather than just lower limits .",
    "moreover , since the optical depth , @xmath70 , is fixed by the silicate feature visibility and the dust mass @xmath91 ( see above ) , it follows that the dust mass is insensitive to the grain - size limits .",
    "we also stress that in the silicate dust model , most of the observed broad 7.514  @xmath10 m emission feature is produced by silicate .",
    "sio makes a relatively minor contribution ( see fig .",

    "the sio decline from about 6@xmath92 to 3.5@xmath92 over the period may also suggest that it was indeed supplying the silicate material .",
    "however , it is possible that some of the mass decline was not real but was actually due to reduced excitation as the ejecta cooled from 900  k to 650  k during this period .",
    "_ ( b ) 690795  days : _ + while we conclude that , up to at least day  464 , the newly formed grains in the ejecta of sn  2004et were dominated by silicate material , the situation at later epochs is somewhat less clear . from day  690",
    "onwards the visibility of the 814  @xmath10 m silicate feature faded quite rapidly .",
    "indeed , by day  795 there may only be a small excess remaining in the silicate region .",
    "the fading of the silicate feature could be due to ( a ) increasing optical depth as more silicate dust forms , or ( b ) an increasing contribution of ir emission from non - silicate dust in a cool dense shell ( cds ) formed by an ejecta / csm collision .",
    "a third possibility is the suppression of the silicate feature by the increased prominence of emission from undisturbed non - silicate csm dust .",
    "however , we have already dismissed above the likelihood of a _",
    "warm _ ir echo , so this mechanism is not considered further . from as early as day  690 , the hot+warm component increasingly exceeded the radioactive input luminosity . indeed , since the models were matched to the continua only , the true hot+warm luminosities are even a little larger than those shown in table  [ tab : sio ] .",
    "the growing luminosity excess relative to the radioactive input implies that an additional energy source must have come into play by day  690 .",
    "a possible explanation for the mir brightening is ir emission from dust produced in a shock - formed cds due to ejecta / csm collision ( see below ) .",
    "such a phenomenon was invoked to account for ir emission from sn  1998s @xcite and sn  2006jc @xcite .",

    "a requirement for a cds to form behind the reverse shock of the supernova is that the cooling time of the shock is shorter than the adiabatic time scale .",
    "the cooling time can be estimated as @xmath94 days @xcite , which is valid for a power - law ejecta with @xmath95 , typical of a red supergiant progenitor .",
    "the requirement that the reverse shock should be radiative until at least day  1150 , as indicated by the last spectrum , and using @xmath96 , translates into a requirement that @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "this is in agreement with both the value of @xmath99 from the radio observations @xcite , and from the x - ray observations , @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the former depends on the temperature of the circumstellar medium , @xmath101 , which is likely to be in the range @xmath102 k , resulting in at least the same mass - loss rate as the x - ray observations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the appearance of the boxy line profiles from the cds is fully consistent with previous mass - loss determinations from this object .",
    "it is , however , interesting that sn  2004et is the first sn  ii - p for which this has been observed .",
    "the question now arises : when did the cds dust begin to significantly affect the mir emission ? between days  300 and 795 the idm luminosity ( table  [ tab : sio ] ) declined roughly exponentially with a @xmath13200  day e - folding time .",
    "there is little sign of an increase in this time constant even as late as day  795 , such as one might expect if cds dust emission was becoming important .",
    "we also note that even as late as day  736 the idm luminosity was less than that of the radioactive deposition , although by day  795 it exceeded it by @xmath1325% .",
    "we therefore suggest that , while the ejecta / csm impact probably began as early as day  690 , significant emission from cds dust began somewhat later , at about day  800 .",

    "nevertheless we conclude that by day  1125 the uniform - density ejecta dust - emission model was no longer appropriate . in any case , as already indicated , by this epoch the vast bulk of the warm - component flux could not have been due to new , radioactively heated ejecta dust , and was probably due instead to cds dust .",
    "the optical spectra also provide evidence for the presence of cds dust .",
    "the tops of the box - like profiles in the day  8231146 optical spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) exhibit a decline from the blue to the red suggesting the presence of dust attenuation within the emission region .",
    "the large , high velocity widths of the boxy features in sn  2004et immediately rule out new ejecta dust as being the main source of the attenuation . fading across the h and",
    "he profiles was also seen in sn  1998s .",
    "@xcite showed that the attenuation was probably due to dust which condensed in a cds formed behind the reverse shock .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the later mir rebrightening was due to ir emission from dust formed in the cds . as the ejecta shock moved into the csm ,",
    "a cds was formed where dust could condense , resulting in the blue - to - red fading in the line profile and producing the excess infrared flux .    to make a rough estimate of the cds dust mass present during the day  11251395 period",
    ", we applied the idm to a shell of dust lying at 6000  au .",
    "adjusting the model to reproduce the mir seds suggests cds dust masses of @xmath105 ( amorphous carbon ) or @xmath106 ( silicates ) .",
    "such masses of the required refractory elements could be produced by a progenitor wind .",
    "the corresponding temperatures and optical depths at 10  @xmath10 m are 330  k and @xmath130.03 for amorphous carbon and 500  k and @xmath130.025 for silicates .",
    "the corresponding @xmath48-band optical depths are 0.6 ( amorphous carb . ) and 0.015 ( silicates ) .",
    "these are in addition to the @xmath44 mag which was present before the cds formation .",
    "we note that while the cds model can provide a fair representation of the fluxes over most of the mir range covered , in the 814  @xmath10 m region the observed `` dip '' is not reproduced .",
    "indeed , the silicate match is very poor in this region owing to the strong silicate emission feature .",
    "the observed dip may be a sign that the dust in the cds has actually condensed into optically thick clumps which , if silicate in composition , might produce a broad absorption in this region .",
    "the cds dust masses for sn  2004et are about a factor of 10 less than the lower limit for the cds dust mass obtained by @xcite for the type  iin sn  1998s . however ,",
    "at about @xmath93  cm , the radius of the sn  2004et cds is much larger than the @xmath107  cm cds radius in the case of sn  1998s .",
    "further investigation of the cds is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an intriguing result from both the warm blackbody models and idms is the remarkable constancy ( standard deviation @xmath108 ) of the model radii throughout the day  300795 era ( tables  [ tab : bb],[tab : sio ] ) , during which time the sn itself expanded by a factor of @xmath109 .",
    "how might this occur ?",
    "given the assumed uniform density , the high optical depth throughout the period implies that the mir `` photosphere '' would always lie quite close to the physical surface of the radiating dust extent of the model .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that , if the photospheric radius remained fixed , as the ejecta flowed through it the model radius would also remain roughly constant . but for this scenario to work the dust flowing beyond the photosphere would have to be replaced within the photosphere at just the right rate to maintain the fixed photospheric radius .",
    "this seems to be a rather contrived scenario .",
    "a more plausible explanation is that the dust actually formed in small , dense , comoving clumps .",
    "such clumps might arise in localized regions of density enhancement . with more efficient cooling in such regions ,",
    "the clumps might be unable to expand against the hotter , higher pressure interclump gas .",
    "we know that in the case of sn  1987a there is strong evidence that the dust formed in clumps @xcite .    in order to explore the effects of clumping on the mir sed , we extended the silicate idm so that it comprised clumps of dust grains , and calculated the seds for days  300795 .",
    "we considered a spherical `` cloud '' of spherical clumps , with a cloud radius of @xmath110 .",
    "the clumps are uniformly distributed within the cloud . at any given time",
    ", each clump has the same uniform number density of dust grains .",
    "the free parameters of the grains are the same as for the idm : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 . for this study ,",
    "the grain number density is allowed to vary , but @xmath74 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are fixed at the same values as adopted for the idm described earlier .",
    "the sed was then derived using a treatment analogous to that of the uniform idm .",
    "a clump - size distribution , @xmath113 is invoked , where @xmath114 is the number density of clumps having radius @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the clump number density scaling factor ( i.e. , it controls the total number of clumps in the cloud , @xmath117 ) .",
    "thus , the free parameters of the clumps are @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath117 .",
    "the model is restricted to the case of nonmerging clumps .",
    "the cloud radius is fixed at @xmath121 where @xmath122 , this being the extent of refractory elements indicated by the metal lines ( see above ) .",
    "the sio contributions were assumed to be the same as in the idm case .",
    "for the hot and cold components we used the same hot blackbody and echo model results as before .",
    "details of the cloud of clumps model are given in the appendix .",
    "the cloud of clumps model was matched to the data using the same criteria as for the idm case .",
    "we considered a simple case where @xmath123 ( a flat number density distribution of clumps ) . for a given @xmath117 , the model match to the sed",
    "is obtained by adjusting @xmath119 and the grain number density .",
    "this match can be maintained over a wide range of @xmath117 by adjusting the clump radius and dust density so that the total dust mass is unchanged . in this study",
    "we fixed @xmath124 for all epochs .",
    "the total dust mass was also insensitive to the choice of @xmath125 , and this was set at 0.01 . using the same model temperatures as for the idm , virtually identical matches to those of the idm were obtained .",
    "the cloud of clumps parameters are listed in table  [ tab : clo ] .",
    "as expected , there was little change in clump radii with time .",
    "@xmath119 first rose to 15% above and then fell to @xmath126% below the value at 300  days .",
    "the filling factor , @xmath127 , defined as the ratio of the volume of clumps to that of the cloud , fell monotonically from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "the clump optical depth evolution at 10  @xmath10 m increased almost monotonically with time , with the largest clumps closely matching the high optical depths of the idm .",
    "in contrast , the optical depth of the cloud decreased from 0.4 to 0.05 .",
    "as with the single - sphere idm , the need to reproduce the silicate feature placed strong constraints on the model .",
    "for example , if we decreased the clump optical depths , and at the same time increased the cloud optical depth to maintain the overall level of the sed , the silicate feature was increasingly suppressed below the observed visibility .",
    "the reverse procedure produced a silicate feature that was too strong .",
    "the total dust mass was very similar to that of the idm , increasing monotonically from @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "these results are as would be expected for a scenario where dust continues to form in clumps of fixed size and where the clumps are comoving with the expansion of the supernova .",
    "it has been believed for some time that clumping occurs in sn ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover @xcite has directly observed small knots [ @xmath132 of the extent of the dust - rich ejecta ] in the snr cassiopeia  a. however , the size distribution and evolution of such clumps is not well understood and does not allow us to constrain the clump model for sn  2004et .",
    "nevertheless , at least for a flat number distribution of uniform - density clumps , we find that the introduction of clumping has a negligible effect on the estimated mass of dust . in particular , for the 300465  days period , the derived masses are actual values rather than upper limits",
    ". it may be that by introducing nonuniform densities within the clumps , larger dust masses could be consistent with the observations , but such calculations are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , this brief study of the effects of clumping adds to the growing weight of evidence that the mass of grains produced in supernova ejecta can be only a minor contributor to the total mass of cosmic dust .",
    "to investigate the possibility that the cold component was due to an ir echo from pre - explosion dust , we used an ir - echo model similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "the model follows those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the input bolometric light curve is a parametrized version of the @xmath133 `` bolometric '' light curve ( blc ) of @xcite : @xmath134 , where + @xmath135 , @xmath136  days for @xmath137  days , + @xmath138 , @xmath139  days for @xmath140  days , + @xmath141 , @xmath142  days for @xmath143  days , + @xmath144 , @xmath145  days for @xmath146  days , + and @xmath147 for @xmath148  days .",
    "@xmath149 is in units of @xmath150  ergs s@xmath64 .",
    "we caution that , owing to the omission of the sn flux outside the @xmath133 range , this input probably underestimates the true total luminosity .",
    "shortward of the @xmath151 band the input function may be only @xmath130.5 of the true peak luminosity , but was probably closer to reality during the plateau phase . at wavelengths",
    "longer than the @xmath50  band , the input function may underestimate the true luminosity by just @xmath135% in the peak but up to 30% during the plateau .",
    "however , at these wavelengths the absorptivity of the dust grains ( size @xmath130.1  @xmath10 m ) is likely to have fallen well below unity . in the ir - echo results presented here we conservatively use just the @xmath133 blc .",
    "preliminary runs of the ir - echo model showed that , for typical grain radii ( 0.050.5  @xmath10 m ) , to reproduce the cold component of the sn sed the dust had to lie at least 10  pc from sn  2004et . in a simple ,",
    "spherically symmetric ir - echo model , a dust mass of @xmath13350m@xmath7 was required to yield the necessary luminosity , corresponding to a total mass of @xmath1360000m@xmath7 .",
    "clearly such a large mass could not have arisen in the progenitor csm .",
    "indeed , such a mass would be exceptionally large even for a star - formation nebula .",
    "a more natural explanation is that the cold component is due to an ir echo from interstellar , rather than circumstellar or otherwise local , dust .",
    "supernova - triggered interstellar ir echoes were first predicted by @xcite and @xcite .    in our interstellar ir - echo model",
    ", we invoked a uniform dust density extending from 10  pc ( see above ) to 100  pc from the supernova .",
    "evaporation by the peak sn luminosity would be unlikely to produce a cavity exceeding @xmath130.1  pc .",
    "however , a 10  pc cavity could have been caused by the progenitor wind or by neighboring stars .",
    "the 100  pc outer limit was chosen as the typical scale height of interstellar dust in a late - type spiral .",
    "( the host galaxy , ngc  6946 , is practically face - on . ) for ease of computation , the spherically symmetric geometry of the ir - echo model was retained . while not appropriate in general for the outer , presumably planar , limits of the dust in the galactic disk , for the early era",
    "being considered ( @xmath133  yr relative to the sn - cavity - edge - sn light travel time of 65  yr ) spherical symmetry provides a good approximation ; at this epoch , the echo ellipsoid is extremely elongated ( small minor / major axis ratio ) , and so the region of the spherical model outer surface intercepted by the ellipsoid is small and well approximates a plane surface .",
    "the outer radius is relatively uncritical for the match to the data : reducing the outer radius by 35% reduces the 24  @xmath10 m flux by just 20% .",
    "for ease of computation , we assumed that the grain material was amorphous carbon where , for wavelengths longer than @xmath152 , the grain absorptivity / emissivity can be well approximated as being proportional to @xmath153 @xcite . for shorter wavelengths , an absorptivity",
    "/ emissivity of unity was used .",
    "also , for simplicity a single grain size was assumed .",
    "a material density of 1.85  g  @xmath154 was adopted @xcite .    in matching the ir - echo model to the cold residual in the data ,",
    "the free parameters were ( i ) the grain size , which influenced the typical dust temperatures , and ( ii ) the grain number density , which determined the luminosity . for gas densities of @xmath155  @xmath154 and maintaining a 0.006 dust / gas mass ratio , fair fits to the residual",
    "were achieved with grain radii in the range 0.20.005  @xmath10 m with corresponding cavity radii of 816  pc and optical depths to uv / optical photons of 0.060.1 . for grain radii",
    "less than @xmath130.02  @xmath10 m the absorption cross - section to uv / optical photons falls below the geometrical value , so for grains smaller than 0.02  @xmath10 m the cavity radius had to be fixed at about 16  pc in order to prevent the dust temperature becoming too low .",
    "in addition , for grain radii less than 0.02  @xmath10 m , the total optical depth to the uv / optical photons converged on a value of about 0.1 . for cavity radii less than 8  pc , to prevent the dust temperature becoming too high the grain size had be increased beyond 0.2  @xmath10 m with a consequent increasingly implausible rise in interstellar medium ( ism ) gas density above 1  @xmath154 .",
    "we adopted a grain radius of 0.1  @xmath10 m , yielding a grain number density of @xmath156  @xmath154 and an ism gas density of @xmath157  @xmath154 .",
    "this is a typical density for the gas disk of a late - type galaxy such as ngc  6946 .",
    "the optical depth to uv / optical photons is about 0.07 , which is easily encompassed within the total @xmath158 mag derived above .",
    "the temperature of the dust grains at the inner cavity edge is 125  k.    in fig.[fig8 ] , upper panel , we show the model ( silicate idm ) match for 464  days and note that by 24  @xmath10 m the ir echo contributes more than half the total flux . in fig.[fig9 ] , where all of the total 3-component model matches ( silicate idm ) are shown , it is particularly striking that the long - wave region ( @xmath159 m ) is well reproduced by an ir - echo model having a _ single _ set of parameters for all epochs in the period 300795  days .",
    "even at days  1125 , 1222 and 1395 the long - wave flux is reasonably reproduced by the ir echo .",
    "we conclude that the cold component is indeed caused by an ir echo from interstellar dust .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite included free - free and free - bound emission in their model of the ir continuum of sn  1987a .",
    "they found that up to about 415  days post - explosion the free - free radiation dominated the total flux longward of @xmath1330  @xmath10 m .",
    "their model did not include possible emission from an interstellar ir echo .",
    "we examined the possible contribution of free - free plus free - bound emission to the sn  2004et spectrum .",
    "we assumed that such emission was dominated by ionised hydrogen in the sn  2004et ejecta .",
    "the total ( ionised+neutral ) mass of hydrogen was assumed to be in the range @xmath160  m@xmath7 and its extent was inferred from the h@xmath3 line widths .",
    "the number density and temperature were adjusted to find the maximum free - free plus free - bound flux which was consistent with the optical to mir observations and with the adopted hydrogen mass range . within these constraints ,",
    "an electron temperature of 44004700  k was obtained at 301  days cooling to 38504100  k at 795  days .",
    "we found that , prior to the ejecta / csm collision , free - free emission could account for up to @xmath1320% of the total 24  @xmath10 m flux at 301  days , declining to less than 1% by 796  days .",
    "we conclude that the long wavelength continuum of sn  2004et was dominated by interstellar ir echo emission .",
    "we would expect the ir - echo luminosity to remain approximately constant until the vertex of the echo ellipsoid reaches the boundary of the dust - free cavity",
    ". this would be in a time given by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the cavity radius .",
    "for the 10  pc dust - free cavity adopted above , and assuming a uniform dust density 10  pc to 100  pc from the supernova , we can expect the echo luminosity to remain constant for about 65 yr .",
    "we would also expect the apparent diameter of the echo to grow with time . at the latest epoch ( day  1395 )",
    "the echo would appear as an annulus having inner and outer diameters of about @xmath163 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this is well below the spatial resolution of _ spitzer _ at 24  @xmath10 m .",
    "however , for the next @xmath1310  yr the annulus would grow roughly as @xmath164 .",
    "thus , an additional test of the ir - echo hypothesis would be , in future missions , to attempt to detect and spatially resolve the mir emission from sn  2004et .",
    "we have presented the first - ever comprehensive mir study of a type  ii - p supernova , the most common of all sn types .",
    "relative to the fluxes at optical wavelengths , the mir luminosity of sn  2004et exhibited a strong and growing excess between 300 and 1395  days past explosion .",
    "we have shown that this is due to three types of supernova - dust interactions .",
    "we have also presented some of the latest - ever optical spectra for this type of supernova .    during the period 300 - 795",
    "days , the sed of sn  2004et is best described in three parts : ( a ) a hot component due to emission from optically thick gas , as well as free - bound radiation , ( b ) a warm component due to newly formed , radioactively heated dust in the ejecta , and ( c ) a cold component due to an ir echo from the ism dust of the host galaxy , ngc  6946 .",
    "there may also have been a small contribution to the ir sed due to free - free emission from ionised gas in the ejecta .",
    "while it is conceivable that the warm component might alternatively have been caused by an ir echo from dust in the progenitor csm , the fine - tuning required to make this scenario work , plus the blueshift in the [ o  i ] @xmath366300 line after day  300 and the accelerated decline in the optical light curves , persuades us that a warm source in newly formed ejecta dust is more likely .",
    "our modeling of the warm component sed for the era 300795  days demonstrates that the dust responsible for the mir radiation must be made of silicate material .",
    "this is the first time that direct spectroscopic evidence has been presented for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of a recent supernova .",
    "additional support for the silicate scenario comes from our detection of a large , but declining , mass of sio , a key compound in the silicate - formation sequence .",
    "the mass of directly detected dust grew to no more than a few times @xmath0 .",
    "a remarkable result of our analysis is that the model radius remained constant ( standard deviation @xmath165% ) throughout the 300795  day era , yet the sn itself expanded by a factor of 2.65 .",
    "we propose that this constitutes evidence that the dust formed in small , dense , comoving clumps , similar to the scenario argued for sn  1987a .",
    "such clumps might arise in localized regions of density enhancement . with",
    "more efficient cooling in such regions , the clumps might be unable to expand against the hotter , higher pressure interclump gas .",
    "we investigated the case of a flat distribution of uniform - density clumps and showed that such a scenario could indeed account for the apparent constancy of the radius of the ir emission region .",
    "moreover , we found that the derived dust masses are much the same as in the case of a uniform cloud of dust ; the invocation of uniform - density clumps does not allow us to `` hide '' larger masses of dust .",
    "we have shown that the cold residual component is well reproduced by a single ir - echo model , where the sn uv / optical flux is reradiated by the interstellar dust of ngc  6946 .",
    "the model match plus the demand that the ism number density should not exceed 1  @xmath154 ( assuming a dust / gas mass ratio of @xmath130.006 ) implies a dust - free cavity of radius 816  pc , possibly caused by the stellar winds of the progenitor and other nearby stars .",
    "while we assumed that the interstellar grains are made of amorphous carbon , we do not rule out other grain materials .",
    "the important point about our ism ir  echo model is that with a single pair of input parameters ( the dust - free cavity radius and the ism dust density ) , we can account for the cold component throughout the 3001395  day era .",
    "this gives us confidence that the ism ir - echo interpretation is correct .",
    "an interesting prediction from this result is that the echo luminosity should remain high for some decades .",
    "moreover , the diameter of the echo annulus on the sky should increase to several arcseconds over the next @xmath1310 yr , potentially resolvable by upcoming mir space missions .",
    "we note also that the occurrence of such cold ir echoes should be relatively common for sne occurring in dusty , late - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite have already pointed out that such an echo provides a natural explanation for the cool mir flux at days  670681 from sn  2003gd .",
    "after @xmath131000  days , we observed a remarkable rise in the optical and mir fluxes .",
    "in addition , by day  823 the optical spectral lines had developed wide , box - shaped profiles with evidence of dust attenuation within the line - producing region .",
    "we interpret these results as being due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitor csm , with the mir flux rise and optical line attenuation resulting from dust formation within the cool dense shell .",
    "we estimate a cds dust mass of @xmath166 , a cds radius of @xmath136000  au , and a total mass of @xmath167 . for a red supergiant wind",
    "this mass is entirely plausible .",
    "also , for a typical velocity of 10 the radius indicates a csm age of @xmath132700  yr .",
    "the work presented here adds to the growing number of studies which do not support the contention that sne are responsible for the large masses of dust in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "there may still be some possibility for the existence of large masses of undetected ejecta dust in young sne .",
    "such dust might ( a ) be formed after the end of the observations , ( b ) be hidden in nonuniform density distributions , or ( c ) exist at very low temperatures and so go undetected in mir / fir studies .",
    "but there are difficulties with each scenario .",
    "option ( a ) would be in conflict with dust - condensation models @xcite which suggest that the bulk of the dust condensation is complete within two years past explosion .",
    "our study , which includes the effects of clumping , reduces the plausibility of option ( b ) .",
    "possibility ( c ) requires most of the dust formed in the ejecta to rapidly cool to less than a few 100  k. it is not clear if this is physically possible , nor whether such a scenario could be made to be consistent with the optical depths indicated by the mir spectra .",
    "this study has demonstrated the rich , multi - faceted ways in which a typical core - collapse supernova and its progenitor can produce and/or interact with cosmic dust .",
    "the range of distance scales over which we observe these processes is also noteworthy : typically 300  au for the ejecta dust , 6000  au for the cds , and over @xmath168  au for the is ir  echo .",
    "we have shown that , at least in the case of silicate dust , through the use of mir spectra we can estimate total masses of dust even in uniform - density clumps which are optically thick _ in the mir_. we find that the mass of directly observed dust produced either in the ejecta or cds never exceeded @xmath169 .",
    "this is consistent with a steadily increasing number of similar results .",

    "<S> we present mid - infrared ( mir ) observations of the type  ii - plateau supernova ( sn ) 2004et , obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope _ between days  64 and 1406 past explosion . </S>",
    "<S> late - time optical spectra are also presented . for the period 300795  </S>",
    "<S> days past explosion , we argue that the spectral energy distribution of sn  2004et comprises ( a ) a hot component due to emission from optically thick gas , as well as free - bound radiation , ( b ) a warm component due to newly formed , radioactively heated dust in the ejecta , and ( c ) a cold component due to an ir echo from the interstellar - medium dust of the host galaxy , ngc  6946 . there may also have been a small contribution to the ir sed due to free - free emission from ionised gas in the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal the first - ever spectroscopic evidence for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of a supernova . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by our detection of a large , but progressively declining , mass of sio . </S>",
    "<S> however , we conclude that the mass of directly detected ejecta dust grew to no more than a few times @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide evidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that , after about two years past explosion , the appearance of wide , box - shaped optical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitor circumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool , dense shell was responsible for a later rise in the mir flux . </S>",
    "<S> this study demonstrates the rich , multi - faceted ways in which a typical core - collapse supernova and its progenitor can produce and/or interact with dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> the work presented here adds to the growing number of studies which do not support the contention that sne are responsible for the large mass of observed dust in high - redshift galaxies . </S>"
