    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in the doped manganite materials@xcite and subsequent study of the properties of these materials has created a great deal of interest in both the application and the underlying cause of cmr .",

    "the samples were grown by off - axis sputtering using composite targets of la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 ( lcmo ) and lamno@xmath2 ( lmo ) material mounted in copper cups .",
    "the substrates were ( 001 ) oriented neodymium gallate ( ndgao@xmath2 ) and ( 100 ) oriented strontium titanate ( srtio@xmath2 ) , silver - pasted onto a stainless steel substrate holder that was radiatively heated from behind by quartz lamps . although there was no direct measurement of the holder temperature for the runs used in this study , previous runs ( under nominally the same conditions ) using a thermocouple clamped onto the front surface of the holder indicated a temperature of 670 @xmath11c .",
    "the lmo target was radio frequency sputtered and the lcmo target was direct current sputtered in a sputter gas composed of 80% ar and 20% o@xmath12 ( as measured by flow meters ) and at a total pressure of 13.3 pa .",
    "these conditions gave deposition rates of @xmath13 17 - 50 nm / hr , with film thicknesses being typically 150 - 300 nm .",
    "after deposition , the samples were cooled in 13.3 kpa of oxygen . from previous work@xcite",
    "it is known that this process can grow manganite films that have low resistivities and high peak temperatures without the use of an _ ex - situ _ anneal in oxygen .    the ca concentration in the films , @xmath3 ,",
    "was determined by x - ray fluorescence measurements , which in turn were calibrated by rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) for companion samples deposited on mgo substrates .",
    "the samples were characterized by standard and high resolution x - ray diffraction scans ( using a philips mrd x - ray diffraction system , with a four - crystal ge 220 monochromator on the incident beam and cuk@xmath14 radiation ( @xmath15=1.5045 @xmath16 ) ) .",
    "@xmath17 scans were taken both along and at various angles to the growth direction , as well as rocking curves and @xmath18 scans ( where @xmath17 is set for a particular reflection at an angle @xmath19 to the film normal , and the film is rotated about the film normal ) to look for misoriented grains .",

    "the film quality for the samples on ndgao@xmath2 is excellent , with rocking curve widths for the ( 004 ) reflection of the order of 200 arc -seconds ( with an instrumental resolution of 15 arc - seconds ) .",
    "the films on srtio@xmath2 had broader rocking curve widths , typically of order 300 arc - seconds , partly due to the fact that the srtio@xmath2 substrates have large rocking curve widths since they are grown by a flame fusion process , rather than the czochralski method used for ndgao@xmath2 substrates .",

    "( the reason for the 4-fold rather than the expected 2-fold symmetry for both materials is due to the acceptance angle on the detector seeing both the ( 202 ) and ( 022 ) reflections . ) the rocking curve widths for the ( 022 ) lcmo reflections are similar to those seen for the ( 004 ) reflections .",
    "fig . [ rho1 ] shows the resistivity vs. temperature for several of the as - deposited films , which have low resistivities and high peak transition temperatures ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "typically , the films on srtio@xmath2 have values of @xmath5 that are @xmath13 15 k lower than films on ndgao@xmath2 , as well as higher resistivities , even though the films on ndgao@xmath2 are under more strain usually . for samples with @xmath23 ,",
    "the resistivity at low temperatures is less than 0.4 m@xmath24-cm , and show a greater than two order of magnitude reduction from the resistivity at @xmath5 , both of which have been used as measures of film quality.@xcite as was noted in the earlier work@xcite , the samples on both substrates maintain a high value of @xmath5 even for low values of @xmath3 .",
    "this report now turns to two areas of the resistivity of the samples .",
    "much work has been done to understand the interaction between the double exchange model and the cmr effect in these materials .",
    "presently the connection is made that polaron interactions are responsible for the cmr effect , which implies that above the peak temperature the resitivity should be dominated by the adiabatic small polaronic resistivity , which is given by @xmath25 .",
    "for the temperature range considered in this study , both the small polaron model as well as the arrhenius relation ( @xmath26 ) fit the data equally well . in the work by song _",
    "et al._@xcite , they found a correlation between the activation energy , @xmath27 , and the value of @xmath5 for oxygen deficient lcmo films , which they intepreted as a linear dependence .",
    "for the films in this study , fig .",
    "[ tpea ] presents a similar study , including results for films of this study that were subsequently annealed to 700 @xmath11c in oxygen , which resulted in an increase in their peak temperature .",
    "clearly in this case the dependence between @xmath5 and @xmath27 is not linear over the whole range , although there is direct relationship between the two .",
    "this dependence is very similar to what was observed by browning _",
    "et al._@xcite where they found a correlation between the activation energy ( assuming a simple arrhenius relation ) and the curie temperature of radiation damaged lcmo films .",
    "one can see that over a limited range of this plot , a linear relationship could be found , but clearly the whole range is more complicated .",
    "in fact the plot seems to show that as the polaronic hopping energy gets large enough , the metal - insulator transition is more rapidly depressed .",
    "what is interesting is that the values here are similar to those found by song _",
    "_ even though their values are for a fixed cation composition and varying oxygen contents , while the films here are for varying dopant levels .",
    "the plot also presents results for lcmo films produced in a similar manner as the films here but on different substrates or growth temperatures .",
    "these are labeled as `` lcmo '' on the plot .",
    "clearly there seems to be a behavior that is more universal than just for carefully controlled samples .",
    "several attempts have been made to describe the low temperature behavior of the resistivity for the manganate materials . in an attempt to explain data which implies a @xmath28 dependence , such as seen in schiffer et al.@xcite , wang and zhang@xcite have looked at the system with single magnon scattering and where the minority spin states near the fermi edge are anderson localized .",
    "they predict that the resisitivity will go as @xmath28 until the temperature decreases below @xmath13 60k , when the behavior changes to @xmath29 . recently ,",
    "et al._@xcite saw the resisitivity of lcmo and lsmo films grown by various techniques behaving as @xmath30 with @xmath31 for the low temperature range .",
    "et al._@xcite have also looked at the case of single magnon scattering , but in their case the minority carriers are not localized . in this model , the single magnon scattering term will go as @xmath32 , but with a temperature dependent coefficent that is due to an energy shift between the minority and majority spin bands .",
    "the signature of this type of behavior is a strong reduction in the @xmath32 term as the temperature is decreased below the minimum magnon energy that would allow scattering between the spin up and down energy bands .    as observed in earlier work@xcite and",
    "is observed here , the low temperature resisitivity for these films is better fit by @xmath33 the present data was examined to see if it can be explained by the work of wang and zhang , especially with the predicted change in temperature dependence , to no avail .",
    "what is found is that , as was seen in jaime _",
    "_ , there is a reduction in the @xmath32 term , typically below 30k .",
    "as such , the low temperature resistivity data for the films was fit using eq.[rhot ] modified by the model of jaime _",
    "the equation used is @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the term @xmath36 in jaime _",
    "et al . _ , with @xmath37 being the minimum magnon energy that would allow scattering between the spin up and down energy bands .",
    "@xmath38 represents the single magnon scattering contribution to the resistivity in the absence of any energy gap .",
    "the fit also incorporates a static impurity term , @xmath39 , and an electron - phonon term , @xmath40 .",
    "the data for @xmath41 was fit using the simplex minimization routine of nelder and mead,@xcite which minimizes an average weighted chi squared , @xmath42 where n is the number of fit points ( typically 400 ) .",
    "the program would rerun the minimization 5 times from random locations in @xmath43 and @xmath44 space to ensure the `` best '' minimization had been found .",
    "typical values of @xmath45 ( which is a measure of the rms error per point for the fit ) were 2 - 3 x 10@xmath46 .",
    "the lowest temperature used in the fitting was down to our lowest measured value ( 6 k or lower ) , unlike the work by mercone _",
    "et al . _ , who had to limit to 20 k and higher due to upturns in the resistivity .",
    "attempts to use a dependence like @xmath47 for the films gave values of @xmath45 larger by a factor of 10 than those of eq .",

    "[ lowrho2 ] the t @xmath50 50 k data for the @xmath51 sample on ndgao@xmath2 is shown , along with the results of fitting eq .",
    "[ rhofit ] , along with results of fitting eq .",
    "[ rhot ] as well as the @xmath30 behavior seen by mercone _",
    "_ one can clearly see the @xmath30 model can not reproduce the lowest temperature behavior .",
    "one can also see that at the lowest temperature , the fit from eq . [ rhot ] underestimates the data , which is due to the supression of the @xmath32 term predicted by jaime _",
    "et al . _    for the films studied here , we see that , in general , there is an increase in @xmath39 and @xmath38 and a decrease in @xmath35 as the ca concentration decreases .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath40 is roughly constant as @xmath3 is varied , with the all the values being higher for films on srtio@xmath2 ( except for @xmath35 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath40 found here is in the same range , but higher , than found by jaime _",
    "et al._@xcite , who saw a value around 1 f@xmath24-cm / k@xmath52 .",
    "our values of all our quantities are larger than seen in the lsmo / lcmo composite mixtures@xcite that were derived using eq .",
    "the increase in @xmath39 as @xmath3 decreases could be tied to the increase in strain for the samples on ndgao@xmath2 , but that would not hold for the films on srtio@xmath2 , which showed a decrease in strain as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "in addition , the fact that the values for @xmath39 being higher on films grown on srtio@xmath2 ( which had overall lower strain than the films on ndgao@xmath2 ) would imply that strain is not the dominant contributor to @xmath39 . the increased rocking curve width for samples grown on srtio@xmath2 would imply an increased static disorder due to grain misalignment , which could explain the higher values of @xmath39 . since the spin wave stiffness , @xmath53 , has been seen to be a consistent value across different materials with various doping levels ( @xmath54 170 mev-@xmath55),@xcite a decrease in @xmath35 would imply a reduction in @xmath56 , the shift in the fermi momentum between the minority and majority spin bands as the doping decreases . from jaime _",
    "the @xmath38 term is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the electron - magnon coupling energy and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the fermi energy , fermi wavevector , and effective mass for the carriers .",
    "it is expected that as @xmath3 decreases , there will be a reduction in both the values of fermi wavevector and energy , which would tend to increase the value of @xmath38 . @xmath53",
    "might be considered to be constant as discussed above . however , without knowing how @xmath58 and @xmath61 vary with @xmath3 , it will be difficult to draw any firm conclusions .    in the earlier work on lsmo",
    "/ lcmo composite mixtures,@xcite a correlation was seen between the magnitude of the @xmath32 coefficient and the residual resistivity in the films . in this work",
    "the same correlation is observed , as shown in fig .",
    "this plot shows the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the films of this study , along with the films from work on lcmo / lsmo composites@xcite , as well as the results reported by jaime _",
    "et al._@xcite on la@xmath62(pb@xmath9ca@xmath10)@xmath63mno@xmath2 single crystals as well as work by snyder _",
    "et al._@xcite on lcmo films .",
    "there is a clear linear correlation between these two values , as was seen before .",
    "in the work on lcmo / lsmo composites , the limited data gave an approximate ratio of 60 - 70x10@xmath64 k@xmath65 , while with the more extensive data here the ratio between the two is more of the order of @xmath13 120x10@xmath64 k@xmath65 .",
    "the interesting thing is that this correlation is seen not only for lcmo films of varying doping , but is also present in mixtures of lcmo and lsmo as well as crystals of pb doped lcmo .",
    "the question arises as to the possible connection between the static resistivity and the amount of single magnon scattering .",
    "the work by snyder _",
    "et al . _ showed a similar behavior for their films , but the point of this paper is that this correlation holds over a wide range of films as well as values of @xmath39 .",
    "for the films of this study , the variation is both due to changes in doping level as well as differering amounts of strain in the samples , which decreases for samples on ndgao@xmath2 and increases for those on srtio@xmath2 as the doping increases . as discussed above , in the model of jaime _",
    "the @xmath38 term depends on the carrier concentration in the materials , as well as the electron - magnon coupling , the effective mass of the carriers , and the spin wave stiffness .",
    "it is possible to imagine that if strain in the films is one cause of increasing @xmath39 , then there could also be a connection to the scattering of the carriers off spin waves as strain could impact other properties in the expression for @xmath38 .",
    "however , it does not appear that strain in the films is the major cause of @xmath39 , and it would be hard to imagine how say an increase in lattice defects would necessarily increase the effectiveness of magnon scattering . the question remains as to whether this correlation is wider than presented here as well as what could be causing the connection between these two scattering processes .",
    "this work has shown that films of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 grown on ndgao@xmath2 and srtio@xmath2 have excellent structural properties , high values of peak resistance temperatures , and low residual resistivities . as seen in the work by song _",
    "_ there is a correlation between the peak resistance temperature and the polaronic hopping energy , but the correlation is not simply linear , but is more complicated , with a more pronounced reduction in the value of @xmath5 with increased values of @xmath27 . the low temperature resistivity of the samples is not fit well by the model of mercone _ et al .",
