    "in a variety of situations , the problem arises of inverting numerically the laplace transform @xmath0 of a given mapping of interest @xmath1 . roughly speaking ,",
    "it turns out that the wider the set @xmath2 where @xmath0 can be computed is , the easier the inversion results . for instance , if @xmath2 is an interval @xmath3 then the numerical inversion becomes an ill - posed problem @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath2 is the complement of some bounded region , then the efficient talbot s method @xcite is at hand .    in the present paper we focus on the particular situation where @xmath2 is a sector symmetric with respect to the real axis , strictly containing the right half plane , and we assume that @xmath0 exhibits a potential behavior on @xmath2 .",
    "we say then that @xmath0 is _",
    "sectorial_. precisely , there is a renewed interest in the numerical inversion of _ sectorial _",
    "mappings @xcite , mainly due to its applicability to linear , non - homogeneous evolution equations of parabolic type ( both in the context of abstract ivp s and volterra equations ) , as well as their discretizations in space @xcite .",
    "notice that the applicability of the inversion approach , in the _ sectorial _ setting , demands in practice that the source term of the parabolic equation must be approximated efficiently ( at least locally ) by holomorphic mappings @xcite .",
    "this difficulty is overcome in @xcite , where the ideas in the present paper are adapted so as to provide accurate reconstructions of the traditional runge - kutta approximations to the solutions of such parabolic problems .",
    "these reconstructions require no regularity on the source term of the problem .",
    "in the present paper we consider the issue of the numerical inversion of _ sectorial",
    "_ mappings by itself . to fix ideas ,",
    "let @xmath4 be a locally integrable mapping , taking values in a banach space @xmath5 , with exponential growth .",
    "denote by @xmath6 its laplace transform .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath0 admits a holomorphic extension to the complement @xmath2 of some acute sector @xmath7 an that there exist constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that @xmath10 the last requirement , with @xmath11 , means that @xmath12 admits a bounded and holomorphic extension to any sector of the form @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 , we select an integer number @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , and set @xmath18 .",
    "then , by the previous remark , @xmath19 is the laplace transform of a mapping @xmath20 , which admits a bounded and holomorphic extension to sectors with semi - angle @xmath21 as before , and now @xmath12 is understood to be the derivative of order @xmath22 of @xmath23 .",
    "notice that in case @xmath0 satisfies a similar inequality @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , then , by using the shifting theorem , the inversion of @xmath0 is reduced to the one of a laplace transform @xmath26 fulfilling ( [ desu ] ) .",
    "since the respective originals @xmath1 and @xmath27 are related by @xmath28 , then we can just approximate @xmath29 .",
    "this is why the analysis is restricted to the situation @xmath30 , i.e. to ( [ desu ] ) .",
    "the goal is to numerically reconstruct @xmath12 from knowledge of a moderate number of evaluations of @xmath0 at suitable nodes @xmath31 .",
    "let us point out that , from a practical point of view , it is essential to take into account that these evaluations are going to be affected by errors .",
    "the starting point of the method we propose is the well - known inversion formula @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a suitable path connecting @xmath34 to @xmath35 which , in our setting , can be taken so as to guarantee the absolute convergence of the integral appearing in ( [ invlt ] ) . as in @xcite ,",
    "we choose @xmath33 the branch of a hyperbola parametrized by a mapping @xmath36 admitting a holomorphic extension to a horizontal strip around the real axis .",
    "the numerical method we propose is simply the truncated trapezoidal rule , applied to the definite integral arising after parametrizing ( [ invlt ] ) by @xmath37 , used with @xmath38 nodes @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and a suitable step size @xmath41 .",
    "the properties of @xmath37 allow us to use the ideas and results in @xcite , where the trapezoidal rule applied to holomorphic mappings on strips is considered .",
    "let us comment that the fast decay of our integrand @xcite yields an improvement of the more general estimates in @xcite .    very often ,",
    "for instance in the context of ivp s ( see illustration  [ ilustracion3 ] in section  [ secexperimentos ] ) , the main computational effort of the method is due to the evaluations of @xmath0 at the nodes @xmath42 , @xmath40 .",
    "an important feature of the present approach is that the same evaluations can be used to approximate @xmath1 at different @xmath43 @xcite . accordingly",
    ", our goal is to obtain a uniform error estimate for the approximation of @xmath1 on intervals of the form @xmath44 $ ] , with given @xmath45 and @xmath46 , rather than at a fixed @xmath47 . essentially , this was the aim in @xcite , whose basic estimates we borrow .",
    "notice also that the algorithm presents two levels of parallelism since , first , the evaluations of @xmath0 at the involved nodes and , second , the evaluations of @xmath1 at a selected finite set of values of @xmath48 $ ] , can be carried out on different processors .    in the present paper , by considering a different choice of the geometrical and scale parameters from the one in @xcite , we improve the results there in two different ways :    1 .",
    "we get a better error bound , which now turns out to be a genuine spectral estimate of the form @xmath49 .",
    "2 .   we also get a weaker dependence of the exponential factor @xmath50 on @xmath51 , since now @xmath52 .",
    "this means , in practice , that with a moderate number of evaluations of @xmath0 we can accurately approximate @xmath1 , uniformly on intervals @xmath53 $ ] with @xmath54 , let us say @xmath55 .    on the other hand , for the choice of parameters",
    "we propose , the precision @xmath56 used in the evaluations of @xmath0 at the required nodes plays a more relevant role than in @xcite .",
    "in fact , ignoring that we always have @xmath57 would result in large actual errors for @xmath58 , as simple numerical experiments show ( see illustration  1 in section  [ secexperimentos ] ) .",
    "this drawback is overcome by minimizing the estimate we get for the actual error ( theorem  [ teorema2 ] ) , which leads to a @xmath59-dependent choice of parameters . with this choice",
    ", the actual error finally behaves for moderate @xmath60 like @xmath49 , with @xmath61 ) , and for large @xmath60 like @xmath62 .",
    "this optimal choice of parameters demands , of course , some information about the size of @xmath56 . in the absence of it , we propose an @xmath60-dependent choice of parameters for which the actual error behaves like @xmath63 , with @xmath64 .",
    "all the above estimates are uniform on @xmath65 , with fixed @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ". moreover , the error constants are made explicit in the analysis and turn out to be reasonable .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ secmetodonumerico ]",
    "we describe the numerical method and show , in theorem  [ teorema1 ] , how to achieve ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
