    "dusty infrared ( ir ) galaxies are known to have a correlation between their infrared luminosities and dust temperatures ( `` @xmath5 relation '' ) . generally speaking ,",
    "ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath7 ) and hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hylirgs ; @xmath8 ) have typical dust temperatures of @xmath9  k , while luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath10 ) and others at lower luminosities have lower dust temperatures of @xmath11  k. this trend was clearly revealed when sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) , which are high - z ulirgs , were compared to ulirgs and other ir galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there have been a number of studies to understand the nature of this relation and its dispersions , such as its dependence on redshifts , different galaxy populations , etc .",

    "* hereafter my15 ) , we have studied the quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that have far - ir ( fir ) counterparts in the wide - field survey data from the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the majority of them are ulirgs , and that their fir emission originated from the cold - dust component is predominantly powered by starbursts rather than active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "one of our conclusions is that they follow the same @xmath5 relation .",
    "we have further shown that this relation is simply due to the limited maximum size of the combined dusty starbursting regions ( hereafter dsbrs ) in the host galaxies .",
    "the motivation of our current work is that this maximum size is only around @xmath12  kpc , which seems to be significantly smaller than the claimed physical sizes of high - z ulirgs based on a number of direct measurements through sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) or radio interferometry .",
    "these observations have sub - arcsec resolutions , and typically result in rather extended sizes of @xmath13  kpc or even larger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we further investigate this problem , using an enlarged sample that incorporates different high - z ir galaxy populations . throughout this _ letter _ , we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16  km / s / mpc .",
    "we followed my15 in this current analysis . only the objects that have spectroscopic redshifts",
    "were used .",
    "the fir counterpart identification was mainly based on the latest source catalogs from three major wide field surveys by _ herschel _ , namely , the herschel multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes , @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the herschel stripe 82 survey ( hers , @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) at 250 , 350 and .",
    "we only considered the objects that are detected in all these three bands .",
    "the largest addition to the my15 sample is through the use of the @xmath18 edition vron catalogue of qusars and active nuclei @xcite , which contains and agn and quasars , respectively ( hereafter `` v - agn '' and `` v - qso '' , respectively ) . the next is from ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  c12  ) , which contains spectroscopically confirmed spire sources in the hermes fields .",
    "we also included the smgs from ( * ? ? ? *  c05  ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  i05  ) , and a few sources of mixed selections from ( * ? ? ? *  m11  ) and ( * ? ? ? *  y14  ) .",
    "any duplicates among these sources and/or the my15 sample were removed .",
    "as in my15 , we obtained the spire photometry by matching the sources to the aforementioned _ herschel _ catalogs , adopting the matching radius of to minimize the contaminated sources due to blending .",
    "we also incorporated a number of objects that are outside of the aforementioned _ herschel _ survey fields but have reported spire photometry .",
    "these include the high - z quasars from ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  l13  ) , the radio galaxies from ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  d14  ) , and the 3c radio sources from ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  p15  ) .",
    "while these objects certainly contain powerful agn , we are convinced ( as are these authors also inclined to believe ) that their fir emissions should be dominated by starbursts as in the sdss quasars presented in my15 .",
    "finally , we included a few high - z ulirgs that are known to be amplified by strong gravitational lensing , which all have spectroscopic redshifts , reported spire photometry and adopted amplification factors ( `` @xmath19 '' ) .",
    "these include the most highly lensed smg from @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  s&i10  ) , the strong planck source from ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  f12  ) , the south pole telescope s lensed galaxies from @xcite and , and the lensed galaxies in the h - atlas sdp from ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  b13  ; only the two sources with grade  a  lensing models and @xmath20 were used ) .      as in my15",
    ", we only studied the coldest dust component , which dominates the fir emission that is sampled by the spire bands .",
    "while this will certainly underestimate ( by @xmath21  dex ) the total ir luminosity that consists of the contributions from other components of higher temperatures , the simplification has the advantages that the associated luminosity can be safely attributed to starbursts and that the dust temperature is uniquely defined .",
    "following my15 , we analyzed their fir seds by fitting a single - temperature , modified blackbody ( mbb ) spectrum .",
    "we briefly describe the procedure below .",
    "we used the ` cmcirsed ` code of @xcite to perform the mbb fitting .",
    "the mbb spectrum can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath3 is the characteristic temperature of the mbb , @xmath23 is the scaling factor that is related to the intrinsic luminosity , @xmath24 is the emissivity ( when @xmath25 equation  [ eq : mbb ] reduces to the form of a black body ) , and @xmath26 is the reference wavelength where the opacity is unity .",
    "we adopted @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the total ir luminosity of the cold - dust component , @xmath2 , can be obtained as @xmath29 by integrating the best - fit mbb model @xmath30 from 8 to .",
    "our further analysis is based on @xmath2 and @xmath3 thus obtained .",
    "we only retained the objects that have reasonable sed fitting quality ( @xmath31 ) and reliable @xmath3 measurements ( @xmath32 ) , which sum up to objects in total .",
    "as examples , figure  [ fig : sedfitting ] shows the sed fitting results for a few objects from our final sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : ltobj ] shows the @xmath5 relation from the entire sample , where the number of contributing objects from each initial sample is also labeled .",
    "the distributions of redshifts and @xmath2 are shown in the first two histograms in figure  [ fig : hist ] .",
    "as addressed in my15 , the @xmath5 trend revealed in figure  [ fig : ltobj ] is not due to selection effects but is governed by the equivalent of stefan - boltzmann law in case of mbb .",
    "here we fully develop this idea .      the location of an object on the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) plane is determined by the intensity of the mbb as expressed in equation  . to obtain the total power radiated from the cold - dust component of the object , i.e. , its total luminosity , one should integrate the mbb function @xmath33 over wavelength and over the solid angle ( `` @xmath34 '' ) that its surface area ( `` a '' ) subtends as seen from the source , and multiply by this surface area : @xmath35 where we make the substitution of @xmath36 , set @xmath37 , and also write @xmath3 as @xmath1 for convenience .",
    "if there were no the modified term @xmath38 to the planck s black body function , the integral above would be @xmath39 and equation   would reduce to the stefan - boltzmann law , i.e. , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . for simplicity",
    ", we introduce @xmath42 which is the equivalent of the stefan - boltzmann constant in the mbb case .",
    "note that @xmath43 is dependent of @xmath1 because @xmath37 is involved .    in the context of this work",
    ", we can take the approximation that the integral in equation   is only over the conventional total ir regime of @xmath30 from 8 to as in equation   such that @xmath44 , i.e. , we have @xmath45 , which we shall refer to as the `` mbb s - b equivalent '' .    assuming spherical symmetry , we can define an `` effective radius '' , @xmath4 , such that @xmath46 .",
    "this is to imagine that all the star - forming regions within the galaxy are combined together and that the sum can be approximated by an effective sphere with the radius of @xmath4 .",
    "we thus have @xmath47 for @xmath3 within the range of interest ( @xmath48100  k ) , the deviation of @xmath43 from @xmath49 is within a factor of two and can be well approximated as @xmath50 for our choice of @xmath51  @xmath19 m and @xmath27 ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig : ltobj ] ) .",
    "thus the data points on the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) plane can be explained by a family of mbb s - b equivalent curves of different @xmath4 , which are shown in figure  [ fig : ltobj ] . a pair of ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) values allow us determine @xmath4 of the combined dusty star forming regions in the galaxy under question .",
    "my15 uses the same argument , and shows that ( 1 ) in the low luminosity regime the increasing of @xmath2 is due to the increasing of @xmath4 , while in the high luminosity regime the increase of @xmath2 has to be attributed to the increased heating intensity , and ( 2 ) @xmath4 can not be increased arbitrarily and has a limit of @xmath6  kpc .",
    "my15 takes a less rigorous approach and approximates the temperature - dependent @xmath43 by @xmath52 and obtains @xmath53 .",
    "the derivation of equation   here is more appropriate , which results in more accurate determination of @xmath4 .",
    "the histograms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] for all the objects in our sample . the vast majority of them ( 98.3% )",
    "have @xmath54  kpc , and this limit is the reason for the observed @xmath5 relation .",
    "following @xcite to convert the infrared luminosity to the sfr and assuming the initial mass function of @xcite , we get @xmath55  @xmath56 . from the @xmath4 values",
    "above , we can derive the sfr surface densities ( hereafter `` sfr2d '' , or `` @xmath57 '' ) that are often used in the literature , where the `` surface area '' going into the calculation is the area of the dsbrs projected on the sky .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry , the total surface area of the @xmath58-th dsbr is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is its radius .",
    "we further make a highly simplified assumption that all the dsbrs in a given galaxy have the same dust temperature .",
    "the definition of @xmath4 thus implies that @xmath61 , where the summation over @xmath58 goes through all the dsbrs .",
    "the projected surface area of the @xmath58-th dsbr on the sky is @xmath62 , and hence @xmath63 .",
    "considering equation   and that @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 .",
    "this means that @xmath57 is constant for a fixed @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we can calculate the sfr volume density ( hereafter `` sfr3d '' , or `` @xmath66 '' ) . under the same assumptions as above",
    ", we define a different effective sphere with the radius of @xmath67 , whose volume is equal to the sum of the volumes of the individual dsbrs in a galaxy , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath69 , and generally there is no easy way to infer @xmath67 from @xmath4 .",
    "however , in the limiting case that there is only one dsbr in the galaxy under question , we should have @xmath70 . therefore",
    ", we can calculate the _ minimum _ sfr volume density ( hereafter `` minsfr3d '' , or `` @xmath71 '' ) as @xmath72 .    the histograms of sfr2d and minsfr3d are shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation now has a new meaning .",
    "as a pair of ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) correspond to one @xmath4 value , and hence one minsfr3d value , the @xmath2-@xmath1 plane can be converted into a minsfr3d `` surface '' , which is shown in figure  [ fig : tlir_sfr3d ] , where the average trend based on the data points in figure  [ fig : ltobj ] is also displayed .",
    "it is immediately clear that our objects form the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 relation because they outline a region that has a narrow spread in minsfr3d .",
    "we emphasize again that , as shown in the simulation of my15 ( see also  2 above ) , the lack of objects in the area below this relation can not be due to selection bias . from figure  [",
    "fig : tlir_sfr3d ] , it is clear that this high-@xmath2 , low-@xmath3 area corresponds to low minsfr3d .",
    "we therefore suggest that this area is a `` zone of avoidance '' in terms of minsfr3d . in other words , very cold ulirgs or hylirgs",
    "should be very rare , because they would require very large @xmath4 ( and hence very low minsfrd ) in order to achieve a high ir luminosity at a low dust temperature . on the other hand , the lack of objects in the area above the current @xmath0-@xmath1 relation outlined by our objects",
    "_ could be _ due to the possible selection bias in our current sample , where we limit to @xmath73  mjy in order to include the most reliable detections in the _ herschel _ spire bands .",
    "we refer the readers to the discussion in my15 for details ( see  4.1 and figure 12 therein ) .",
    "while the limited @xmath4 ( @xmath6  kpc ) seem to contradict the claimed extended sizes of high - z smgs ( see  1 ) , there is a reconciliation when considering that even the sub - arcsec sub - mm interferometry might still can not resolve individual dsbrs at high - z ( @xmath74  kpc at @xmath75 ) if they are too close to each other . in other words",
    ", the very extended sub - mm morphologies could simply be due to the blending of a number of discrete dsbrs that are widely separated but still not resolved by the interferometry available today .",
    "currently , the only way to resolve the individual dsbrs at high - z is through strong gravitational lensing , in which case the highly amplified background source could show its morphology in great details , albeit in the distorted image plane . by properly modeling the lens , its image in the source plane",
    "could be reconstructed to reveal the intrinsic morphology .",
    "however , the accuracy of the reconstruction depends highly on how strong the amplification is and how well the lens is modeled .    unfortunately , there are still not many such measurements publicly available for us to compare to , especially when we require spectroscopic redshifts and the spire photometry .",
    "the best example to date is the smg smmj2135 - 0102 from s&i10 , which is amplified by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "its fir emission is dominated by four individual dsbrs , each being mirrored into two images . by averaging the results from the reconstructions based on the two sets of mirrored images , the intrinsic radii of these four dsbrs are 390.0 , 290.5 , 192.5 , and 94  pc , respectively .",
    "as these radii are the fwhm sizes , and hence only enclose @xmath77% of the total light from each dsbr , they should be corrected by multiplying a factor of @xmath78 to the `` full sizes '' . following ",
    "3.2 , we get @xmath79  pc . in  3.1 , we obtained @xmath80 , @xmath81  k and @xmath82  pc .",
    "this size agrees with the above to @xmath83% . considering that these four dsbrs ,",
    "while being the dominant sources , might not contribute 100% of the total @xmath2 , the actual agreement could be even better .    for comparison , here",
    "we also discuss the case of arp 220 , which is the representative of the classic ( low - redshift ) ulirg population .",
    "arp 220 has two nuclei , which have recently been directly resolved in sub - mm by @xcite using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) . based on their highest resolution observations at ( half - power bandwidth of @xmath84 )",
    ", these authors derived the fwhm sizes of the two nuclei ( assuming gaussian profiles ) as @xmath85 and @xmath86  pc , respectively . using spheres for approximation",
    ", we obtain the equivalent radii of 106 and 126  pc , respectively .",
    "they also suggest that these two nuclei account for @xmath87 - 76% of the total fir continuum , and hence we adopt the middle value of 74% .",
    "similar to the calculation above , we correct the measured fwhm sizes by a factor of @xmath88 to the full sizes , and obtain @xmath89  pc .",
    "as arp 220 is very close ( we adopt 77  mpc as its luminosity distance ) , using the spire bands alone would not result in a reasonable fit to its sed because these bands are too far away from the peak of its fir emission .",
    "therefore , we use the photometry at @xmath90 , retrieved from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "we obtain @xmath91 , @xmath92  k and @xmath93  pc . considering the uncertainties ( especially the fractional contribution from the two nuclei to the total fir emission )",
    ", the agreement is very reasonable .",
    "our mbb model fixes @xmath26 to , which is about the smallest choice adopted in the literature .",
    "as discussed in my15 ( see appendix a ) , the difference in @xmath26 impacts the derived @xmath3 significantly but has little effect on @xmath2 .",
    "if the sed fitting can achieve the similar quality , adopting a larger @xmath26 will result in a higher @xmath3 , and hence a smaller @xmath4 . for a given @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath4 still sensitively depends on @xmath3 .",
    "for example , if we take a crude approximation and ignore the temperature dependence of @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to derive @xmath4 to an accuracy better than a factor of a few , especially at @xmath96 where the mbb s - b equivalent curves are highly degenerated .",
    "however , our main conclusions still hold regardless of such limitations .",
    "first of all , @xmath4 can not be increased arbitrarily . even in the hylirg regime ,",
    "it is still mostly confined to @xmath6  kpc . while in the low luminosity regime",
    "the increasing of @xmath2 can be achieved by increasing @xmath4 ( e.g. , increasing the number of dsbrs ) , in the high luminosity regime this can only be achieved by increasing the strength of the starburst ( i.e. , reflected in the rapid increase of @xmath3 ) .",
    "my15 has already reached this conclusion , and here we reinforce it with an enlarged sample that consists of objects from different initial selections , such as smgs , high - z radio galaxies , etc .",
    "second , the @xmath0@xmath1 relation reflects the equivalent of the stefan - boltzmann law in case of mbb and the aforementioned limit to @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , this relation outlines the boundary of minsfr3d , which provides new clues in understanding dusty starbursting environment .",
    "the value of minsfr3d should be quite close to the actual sfr volume density , although strictly speaking it is only the lower limit . in the simplest case where the dsbrs are all spheres of the same radius and dust temperature , @xmath97 , where @xmath23 is the total number of dsbrs in the galaxy .",
    "third , the small @xmath4 values suggest that the dsbrs in high - z ulirgs are as physically compact as their counterparts in the local universe . it is true that a small @xmath4 could still be the result of an extended dsbr with a low filling factor .",
    "however , our test cases in  3.4 strongly supports the scenario that dsbrs are universally compact ."
