    "this slow wave is a static mode below a critical frequency , depending on the viscosity of the saturating fluid . in the current study",
    ", we will focus on this low - frequency range .",
    "the coupling between acoustic and poroelastic media is of high interest in many applications : sea bottom in underwater acoustics @xcite , borehole logging in civil engineering @xcite , and bones in biomechanics @xcite .",
    "many theoretical efforts have dealt with the acoustic / porous wave propagation .",
    "various boundary conditions have been proposed to describe the hydraulic contacts : open pores , sealed pores , and imperfect pores involving the hydraulic permeability of the interface @xcite .",
    "reflection and transmission coefficients of plane waves have been derived @xcite .",
    "the influence of the interface conditions on the existence of surface waves has been investigated in the case of inviscid @xcite and viscous saturating fluids @xcite in the porous material .",

    "experimental works have shown the crucial importance of hydraulic contact on the generation of slow compressional wave @xcite .",

    "must overcome the following difficulties :    * in the low - frequency range , the slow compressional wave is a diffusive - like solution , and the evolution equations become stiff @xcite .",
    "it drastically restricts the stability condition of any explicit method ; * the diffusive slow compressional wave remains localized near the interfaces . capturing this wave - that plays a key role on the balance equations - requires a very fine spatial mesh ; * an accurate description of arbitrary - shaped geometries with various interface conditions is crucial .",
    "these properties are badly discretized by finite - difference methods on cartesian grids . alternatively",
    ", unstructured meshes provide accurate descriptions , but the computational effort greatly increases . * an accurate modeling of the hydraulic contact at the interface is also required .",
    "in particular , as far as we know , imperfect pore conditions still have not been addressed in numerical models .    to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we adapt a methodology previously developed in porous / porous media @xcite and fluid / viscoelastic media @xcite .",
