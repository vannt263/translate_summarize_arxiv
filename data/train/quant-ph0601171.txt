    "@xcite provided stunning evidence that a gain of some db over the standard quantum limit is achieved in the resonant interaction of atoms with squeezed light .",
    "their experiment was performed by combining in a well defined phase relation a coherent field with the output of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) operating below  threshold .",

    "standard methods rely on direct measurement of the radiation intensity entering and leaving the sample .",
    "sufficient accuracy can be achieved by using beams so intense to contrast the shot  noise , although , in some circumstances , using high input intensity is either not useful ( in case of very low absorption ) or unwise ( strongly non - linear materials or samples whose structure may be altered by intense photon fluxes ) .    in alternative to the above schemes @xcite in the proposed method the sample is irradiated with a squeezed vacuum field .",
    "then , the emerging one is combined with a coherent one ( local oscillator , lo ) in a balanced homodyne detector measuring the fluctuations in a suitable spectral range .",

    "since the detected signal is proportional to @xmath5 times the lo amplitude , the detection is efficient also in case of very weak beams , as in the present case .",
    "consequently , the effects of the snr on the accuracy can be disregarded .",
    "essential to this method is the use of a gaussian distributed quadrature @xmath6 .",
    "this means that for testing the method it is necessary to preliminarily measure the distribution function by sampling @xmath5 an adequate number @xmath7 of times . in alternative , it is also possible to determine the whole wigner function with quantum homodyne tomography ( qht ) @xcite using samples uniformly distributed over the whole interval @xmath8 .",
