    "one of the most interesting applications of photonic crystals ( phcs ) is the localization of light to very small mode volumes  below a cubic optical wavelength .",
    "the principal confinement mechanism is distributed bragg reflection ( dbr ) , in contrast to , e.g. , microspheres or microdisks , which rely solely on total internal reflection ( tir ) . however , since three - dimensional ( 3d ) phcs ( employing dbr confinement in all 3d in space ) have not been perfected yet , the mainstream of the phc research has addressed 2d phcs of finite depth , employing dbr in 2d and tir in the remaining 1d .",
    "such structures are also more compatible with the present microfabrication and planar integration techniques",
    ". these cavities can still have small mode volumes , but the absence of full 3d confinement by dbr makes the problem of the high - quality factor ( high - q ) cavity design much more challenging .",

    "a general recipe for designing optimized nanocavities is missing , and it is also not known if cavities better than the ones presently known are possible ; these are exactly the issues that we will address in this article . in section [ sect2 ] , we will first derive a simple set of equations for calculation of cavity @xmath1 and mode volume . in section [ sect3 ] we estimate the optimum @xmath0-space distribution of the cavity mode field . in section [ sect5 ]",
    ", we will finally address the question of finding phc cavities with maximum possible figures of merit for various applications . in this process , we start from the optimum @xmath0-space distribution of the cavity field ; then we derive an approximate analytical relation between the cavity mode and the dielectric constant along a direction of high symmetry , and use it to create a cavity that supports the selected high-@xmath1 mode in a single step .",

    "as described in reference @xcite , the radiation vectors in cartesian coordinates are proportional to 2d fourier transforms of the parallel ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) field components at the surface @xmath13 ( fig .",
