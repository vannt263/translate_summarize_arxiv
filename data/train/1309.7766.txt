    "the general problem that this article is about is the following : consider a nonlinear equation system and an outer iteration method to solve it that consists of solving a subproblem at each step using a second , inner iteration method .",
    "now we want to answer the following question : how can we efficiently control the iteration error of the outer iteration method ? or otherwise put : how accurate do we need to solve the inner systems to obtain a certain iteration error for the outer nonlinear equation ?    for the case of the outer iteration being newton s method , this problem has been successfully solved . the inner problem is a linear system and the concept of an inexact newton s method was introduced in @xcite . there",
    ", at each newton step the inner iteration is terminated when a relative tolerance criterion in the linear residual is satisfied .",
    "based on this , it is possible to give conditions on the sequence of relative tolerances to obtain linear , superlinear or quadratic convergence of the inexact newton s method . essentially , the sequence of tolerances has to converge to zero fast enough as the newton scheme progresses and then quadratic convergence is obtained .",
    "following up , a strategy that has this property and leads to a very efficient scheme was suggested in @xcite .",
    "there , the point is that the initial systems are solved quite coarsely and these schemes are part of widely used software packages , for example of sundials @xcite .    note that with this knowledge , the choice of iterative solver for the inner iteration obtains a better basis : if most of the systems are solved very coarsely and thus very few iterations are needed , it is more important that the method is cheap per iteration than how fast we can reach machine accuracy . in this",
    "setting , when looking at unsymmetric linear systems and krylov subspace methods , gmres @xcite beats bicgstab @xcite , since it needs only one matrix vector product per iteration instead of two .",
    "now when looking at fixed point iterations , an iteration typically consists of evaluating a function and not of solving a system .",
    "however , two prominent and important examples where this happens are the picard iteration and fluid - structure interaction and thus we call these inexact fixed point schemes . surprisingly , the problem framed in the first paragraph has not been analyzed for these .",
    "for the picard iteration , which is a common tool in the context of the incompressible navier - stokes equations , the evaluation of the right hand side corresponds to solving a linear system .",
    "strategies for choosing a termination criterion for the inner iteration are empirically discussed for example in @xcite .    in fluid - structure interaction , a standard approach",
    "are partitioned coupling schemes , where existing solvers for the subproblems are reused @xcite .",
    "commonly in the form of a dirichlet - neumann iteration , this consists of subsequently solving the fluid and the structure problem with appropriate boundary conditions and reasonable tolerances .",
    "it is common to formulate the coupling condition at the interface in the form of a fixed point equation .",
    "recently , it was suggested to use a time adaptive implicit time integration scheme for fluid structure interaction @xcite , where the time step is chosen based on an error tolerance . as is common in this setting ,",
    "the tolerances for the solvers for the appearing nonlinear equation systems are chosen such that the iteration error does not interfere with the error from the time integration scheme @xcite , but nevertheless as large as possible to avoid unnecessary computations .",
    "thus , it is imperative to be able to control the iteration error .    to solve our problem",
    ", we proceed in the following way .",
    "first , we will review well known results on perturbations of fixed point schemes @xcite .",
    "the general idea is then to quantify the iteration errors based on the termination criterion of the inner iteration such that the existing perturbation results can be applied . for the dirichlet - neumann iteration",
    ", we first have to extend the perturbation results to the case of a nested fixed point equation of the form @xmath0 .",
    "as it turns out , the type of termination criterion chosen in the inner solver is crucial for the answer to our problem in that when using a nonstandard relative criterion , we obtain convergence of the fixed point iteration to the exact solution independently of how accurate we solve the inner systems , leading to an efficient way of controlling the outer iteration error .    on the other hand , no general statement can be made on a standard relative or absolute termination criterion , but the analysis suggests that these do not have favorable properties .",
    "all of this is confirmed by numerical results , which show that the latter criteria cause convergence to a solution that is farther away from the exact one the less accurate we solve the linear systems or otherwise put , the less error we want in the fixed point equation , the more accurate we have to solve the linear systems .",
    "consider the fixed point equation @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 closed and where we assume that @xmath5 is lipschitz continuous with lipschitz constant @xmath6 .",
    "this implies by the banach fixed point theorem that has a unique solution @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we consider the perturbed fixed point iteration @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a perturbation that could originate from an iterative solver and for simplicities sake we denote the norm of @xmath9 by @xmath9 as well .",
    "we furthermore assume for simplicities sake that @xmath10 is also a self - map on @xmath4 .",
    "thus this iteration obtains a solution @xmath11 of the perturbed fixed point equation @xmath12 the question is now : how far is the solution @xmath11 of that equation away from @xmath7 ?",
    "the answer is giving by the following theorem , see for example @xcite .",
    "[ ortrhetheorem ] for the solutions @xmath11 and @xmath7 of problems and we have :",
    "@xmath13    this means that the error is of the order @xmath9 as is to be expected , but interestingly , it becomes larger , the closer the lipschitz constant of @xmath14 is to one or otherwise put , the less contractive the function is .",
    "this implies that in these cases , the error will be much larger than @xmath9 and thus a much smaller tolerance would have to be supplied to acchieve the desired error .",
    "note that in practice , we typically do not know the lipschitz constant and that in the nonlinear case , it depends on the definition of the domain @xmath4 .",
    "thus the important lipschitz constant is the local one in the solution .    if we instead consider a sequence of perturbations @xmath15 , respectively a nonconstant perturbation , and thus the iteration @xmath16 the first question is when this sequence converges to @xmath7 .",
    "the answer is given by the next theorem , also from @xcite :    [ perturbedtheorem ] the iteration converges to the solution of the unperturbed problem if and only if @xmath17 .",
    "a specific case is @xmath18 with @xmath19 , which we call the adaptive strategy .      as an application of the above theorems",
    ", we now analyze the convergence of the picard iteration .",
    "this is often employed in the context of the incompressible navier - stokes equation and corresponds to a fixed point iteration for the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an approximation of a jacobian in @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "thus , the fixed point iteration @xmath23 is implemented by solving @xmath24 for @xmath25 up to a certain tolerance using an iterative scheme .",
    "the scheme can be analyzed either as a fixed point scheme , which results in linear convergence provided that the lipschitz constant @xmath26 of @xmath27 can be bounded from above away from one or as a method of newton type where @xmath28 is an approximation of the exact jacobian and we have linear convergence as long as this approximation is good enough .    when solving , either the relative termination criterion @xmath29 the relative termination criterion @xmath30 or the absolute criterion @xmath31 are used , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are relative and adaptive tolerances .",
    "to analyze the consequences of choosing one of these using theorems 1 and 2 , we need to quantify the perturbation in the form .",
    "thus , we define @xmath34 to obtain @xmath35 and we can write @xmath36    in the case of the relative termination criterion , we can estimate the norm of the right hand side in by @xmath37 we furthermore have @xmath38 thus , @xmath39 all in all , we obtain with the condition number @xmath40 @xmath41 with the additional and reasonable assumption that @xmath42 is bounded , this is a perturbation of the form and @xmath15 converges to zero independent of the choice of @xmath32 !",
    "thus by theorem [ perturbedtheorem ] this iteration converges to the exact solution independently of how accurate we solve the linear equation systems .",
    "we now formulate this as a theorem .",
    "[ picardtheorem ] let @xmath43 and the function @xmath28 be given that maps the closed set @xmath44 onto quadratic regular matrices .",
    "assume that the function @xmath45 is lipschitz continuous with lipschitz constant @xmath6 and correspondingly has a unique fixpoint @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore assume that @xmath46 is bounded on @xmath4 and that the inexact fixedpoint iteration defined by converges to a limit @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath47 , independent of the choice of @xmath32 .",
    "in case of the relative criterion , the estimate @xmath48 for the norm of the left hand side in holds which is bounded away from zero provided that @xmath49 is .",
    "thus , it is not clear if this iteration satisfies theorem [ perturbedtheorem ] , but in the general case , the iteration will not converge to @xmath7 .",
    "similarly if we use the absolute termination criterion , we obtain @xmath50 which is also bounded away from zero if @xmath49 is .",
    "numerical results that confirm theorem [ picardtheorem ] and demonstrate that the other two iterations behave like being of the form can be found in section [ picardresultssection ] .",
    "we would like to point out that the criterion is sometimes suggested in the literature on the picard iteration , e.g. @xcite , but that an absolute termination criterion is suggested in @xcite .",
    "there it is suggested to just `` gain one digit '' , meaning to use a tolerance of 0.1 .",
    "now consider two functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 closed and the fixed point equation @xmath54 again with solution @xmath7 .",
    "we now consider an iteration where both the evaluation of @xmath55 and of @xmath56 are perturbed , namely @xmath56 is perturbed by @xmath57 and @xmath55 by @xmath15 : @xmath58 again , assume that this iteration is well defined and that this sequence has the limit @xmath11 .",
    "then , we obtain the following theorem .",
    "[ fsitheorem ] let @xmath55 and @xmath56 be lipschitz continuous with lipschitz constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath61 .",
    "then we have , if @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , that @xmath64 in the case @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath67 finally , @xmath47 if and only if both @xmath57 and @xmath15 converge to zero .    proof : the proof is technically identical to the one of theorem [ ortrhetheorem ] .",
    "we have due to the lipschitz continuity @xmath68 and thus in the limit @xmath69 , @xmath70    for a constant perturbation overall , e.g. @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , we obtain in the limit @xmath71 which proves the inequality .",
    "if we have constant but separate perturbations @xmath9 and @xmath72 of @xmath56 and @xmath55 , we obtain from @xmath73    in the general case , due to positivity , the right hand side of is zero if and only if both @xmath15 and @xmath57 are such that for @xmath74 or @xmath75 , @xmath76 by an identical proof to theorem 2 , this is the case if and only if both @xmath15 and @xmath57 converge to zero .    note",
    "that this implies that the sequence @xmath15 perturbing the inner function @xmath55 is less important by a factor of the lipschitz constant @xmath60 of the outer function .",
    "thus , a possible strategy is to define @xmath77 meaning that we solve the fluid part less accurate by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath60 has to be known for this .      as an application of the theory from section 2.3",
    ", we consider a problem that is a basic building block in fluid structure interaction , namely the transmission problem , where the laplace equation with right hand side @xmath78 on a domain @xmath4 is cut into two domains @xmath79 using transmission conditions at the interface @xmath80 : @xmath81    we now employ a standard dirichlet - neumann iteration to solve it .",
    "using any linear discretization , this corresponds to alternately solving the problems @xmath82 and @xmath83 were problem corresponds to a discretization of the transmission problem on @xmath84 only with dirichlet data on @xmath85 given by @xmath86 on the coupling interface and problem corresponds to a discretization of on @xmath87 only with neumann data on @xmath85 given by the discrete normal derivative of @xmath88 on @xmath85 .",
    "it can be shown that convergence of the approximate solutions on the whole domain is equivalent to the convergence of the solution on the interface only @xcite .    by considering - as one iteration , we obtain a fixed point formulation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is @xmath91 on the interface , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . hereby @xmath94 is the matrix that computes the discrete normal derivatives in @xmath84 on @xmath85 and @xmath95 is the discrete trace operator with respect to @xmath85 .",
    "otherwise put , @xmath95 is the projection of the space that @xmath91 is in onto the space of discrete unknowns on @xmath85 .    in practice ,",
    "the linear equation systems are solved iteratively , typically using the conjugate gradient method ( cg ) up to a relative tolerance of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we obtain a perturbed nested fixed point iteration of the form and the question is now again if we can quantify this perturbation .",
    "we have @xmath97 and @xmath98    for the iteration we obtain @xmath99 again , the second factor is what is tested in the termination criterion of cg . in the case of the relative criterion , here",
    "stated as @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 @xmath102    now the point is that since the whole iteration is linear , we can write down a linear mapping that maps @xmath103 onto @xmath104 for arbitrary @xmath63 .",
    "let this have lipschitz constant @xmath105 , then we have @xmath106 thus the perturbation has limit zero if @xmath107 .",
    "this is the case if and only if the sequence @xmath108 is convergent , which is in fact the case provided that @xmath78 is sufficiently harmless , as can be seen from the literature on domain decomposition methods , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "analagously to the picard iteration , if we choose the absolute termination criterion or the relative one based on the right hand side , we obtain a bound of the form @xmath109 respectively @xmath110 again , we can not make a statement on the limit of @xmath15 .    in the second case , meaning the iteration with neumann data , we obtain @xmath111 and analogous arguments produce the same results for @xmath57 . thus by theorem [ fsitheorem ] , we have that when using the relative criterion we obtain convergence to the exact solution for any @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to note that under the assumptions , all sequences considered , wether perturbed or not , are convergent and therefore , the fixed point iteration will terminate when using the standard criterion @xmath112 however , as just shown , the perturbed iteration converges to an approximation of the unperturbed fixed point and thus , the algorithm can terminate when we are in fact not @xmath113-close to the solution .",
    "a further difference between the different iterations that should be stressed is that the iterations perturbed by a constant are fixed point iterations , wheras the schemes with a variable perturbation are in fact , not .",
    "thus , the convergence speed , which is otherwise linear with constant @xmath26 , is not clear and numerical evidence suggests that it is in fact slower than for the other iteration .",
    "thus , we could argue to employ the schemes with constant perturbation , measure the lipschitz constant numerically after a few iterations and then adjust the tolerance based on theorem [ ortrhetheorem ] or [ fsitheorem ] .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear what the @xmath9 from these theorems is , respectively , it is based on quantities that are hard to measure like @xmath114 . thus , we can not guarantee a certain iteration error in this way , to do this we must employ the nonstandard relative termination criterion .    finally , it is important to note that this analysis is mostly relevant to the time independent case . otherwise , when considering this inside an implicit time integration scheme , additional requirements on the solutions appear , namely that the solutions in the subdomains have a certain accuracy .",
    "for all numerical experiments , the fixed point iteration is terminated when the norm @xmath115 is smaller than @xmath116 . furthermore , with the exception of the results on the picard iteration , all computations were performed in matlab , where matlab 2012a was used for all computations with the exception of the results in section 3.2.3 , where matlab 2013a was employed .",
    ".[problem2xepsminusxstar]@xmath117 ( left ) and @xmath118 ( right ) for different values of @xmath9 and @xmath26 for the solution of the scalar nonlinear equation [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results are depicted in table [ fsiproblemefficiency ] . for the computation with a - divergence",
    "was observed .",
    "otherwise , the schemes roughly obey the desired behavior that the error is proportional to tol , although all are above the desired accuracy .",
    "otherwise , the scheme corresponding to is about a factor of five faster than that corresponding to and up to a factor of two faster than that corresponding to while providing more accurate results .",
    "we considered perturbed fixed point iterations where the perturbation results from inexact solves of equation systems by iterative solvers .",
    "thereby , we extended a perturbation result for fixed point equations to the case of a nested fixed point equation . applying these results to the picard- and the dirichlet - neumann iteration for steady states",
    ", we showed that these converge to the exact solution indepently of the tolerance in the subsolver , if a specific relative termination criterion is employed .",
    "this justifies extremely coarse solves in the inner solvers and suggests the use of gmres as krylov subspace solver for unsymmetric systems .",
    "if an absolute or standard relative criterion is used , the theory indicates that we will not converge to the exact solution .",
    "numerical results demonstrate this behavior .",
    "thus , to obtain a certain accuracy in the fixed point solution when using a standard relative or absolute criterion , we have to solve the inner systems more accurate the tighter the tolerance , whereas for the nonstandard relative criterion we can solve the inner systems very coarsely independent of desired accuracy .",
