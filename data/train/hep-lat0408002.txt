    "compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory in 4d displays a confined phase , analogous to non - abelian gauge models ; since different gauge theories may share the same ( qualitative ) mechanisms for confinement , it is interesting to study an external , static @xmath0 pair in this model , which provides a very simple confined system .    the fundamental d.o.f . of the pure gauge theory",
    "are @xmath1 phase variables defined on the oriented bonds of an isotropic hypercubic lattice , the dynamics is described by wilson action : @xmath2 . for @xmath3 @xcite the system is confined , while for @xmath4 it is in a deconfined ( `` coulomb  like '' ) phase .",
    "this theory enjoys a `` duality '' @xcite property : via a group fourier transform , the partition function and observable vev s map to a dual formulation in terms of @xmath5 variables . in 4d",
    "the dual model is still a gauge model of `` ferromagnetic '' nature : @xmath6 ( we follow notation of @xcite , where the same method was used to study this model ) .",
    "this exact mapping allows one to get results for u(1 ) theory from simulations of the dual model .",
    "a @xmath0 pair ( represented by polyakov lines in the original model ) can be introduced by means of a stack of topological defects @xmath7 onto a set of plaquettes : @xmath8 simulating the dual model gives some practical advantages from the numerical point of view ; the major improvement arises evaluating ratios between polyakov line correlators at increasingly large interquark distance , which are affected by exponential signal - to - noise ratio decay in direct simulations , whereas this problem can be completely overcome in simulations of the dual model  see also @xcite .",
    "this method was used for @xmath9 gauge model in 3d @xcite , and it is a possible alternative to other error reduction algorithms , like the one proposed by lscher and weisz @xcite , which has been successfully used in a number of works about different gauge theories @xcite , including u(1 ) lgt in 4d @xcite . however , this duality - inspired technique can not be straightforwardly generalized to non - abelian su(n ) theories .",
    "we focused our attention onto the profile of the electric field longitudinal component induced in the symmetry plane between the static charges , onto the interquark potential , and force .    according to the dual superconductor picture , at large distance @xmath10 from the mid - point between the external charges ,",
    "the electric field is expected to be described by a modified bessel function : @xmath11 @xmath12 being the mass of the dual gauge boson .",
    "this is based on a purely classical analysis ; however , fluctuations of the flux tube can be included @xcite : they induce logarithmic growth of the flux tube width @xcite .",
    "the interquark potential and force can be worked out from polyakov loop correlators , which , according to the bosonic effective string scenario , are expected to behave as @xcite : @xmath13^{d-2 } } \\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the interquark distance , @xmath15 is the polyakov line length , @xmath16 is the string tension , and @xmath17 denotes dedekind s function . correspondingly , the interquark potential @xmath18 reads @xcite : @xmath19 where we also included a possible `` boundary term '' contribution ( depending on @xmath20 ) which was suggested in @xcite , although it would break the expected open ",
    "closed string duality @xcite . however , this picture is under debate : in various gauge models it was observed that , despite the fact that the string behaviour onset already appears at short distances ( corresponding to @xmath21 fm or so ) , in that very same region the excited state spectrum does not match the expected effective string pattern @xcite .    in our runs",
    ", we considered various lattice sizes ( typically @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 values in the range from 0.96 to 1.01 . in the study of the @xmath24 profile ,",
    "we chose interquark distances @xmath25 from 3 to 7 ; the results show rotational invariance and ( at least qualitatively ) the expected scaling properties as @xmath23 or @xmath25 are varied .",
    "the profile has a marked peak centered in the mid - point between the charges , and a fast ( most likely exponential - like ) decay as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "errorbars for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ radialfig ]     in the symmetry plane between the external charges , as a function of @xmath10 , the distance from the @xmath0 mid - point .",
    "results for @xmath26 , @xmath27 . ]    are smaller than plotted symbols , but more precise statistics is needed in order to confirm or refute the large @xmath10 behaviour predicted by eq .",
    "( [ expectedex ] ) .    as it concerns the interquark potential and force , in fig .",
    "[ forzafig ]    . ]",
    "we plot the interquark force @xmath28 _ versus _ the @xmath0 distance @xmath14 ; @xmath29 is sommer s scale @xcite .",
    "notice the constant errorbars for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "the dotted line is a fit to the theoretical expectation for @xmath30 obtained by derivation of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with @xcite ; data analysis for @xmath18 and @xmath30 shows that the string behaviour is indeed confirmed at large distances , whereas at shorter distances the role of possible further contributions beyond the lscher term is not completely clear .",
    "our preliminary numerical results show qualitative agreement with the predictions for the electric flux induced by external charges .",
    "as it concerns the interquark potential and force , the effective string scenario appears to be confirmed at large interquark distances , whereas at shorter distances the picture breakdown seems not to be completely cured by including a boundary term .",
    "as it is suggested by a comparison among different gauge models @xcite , we guess that a possible effective pattern at short distances might be _ non - universal _ , _ i.e. _ dependent on the gauge theory .",
    "further details , larger statistics results , and a more complete data analysis are published in ref .",
