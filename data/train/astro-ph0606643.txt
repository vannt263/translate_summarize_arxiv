    "_ planck _ will be the first mission to map the entire cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) sky with mjy sensitivity and resolution better than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the science enabled by such a mission spans many areas of astrophysics and cosmology , but in this short proceedings i can focus on only a few .",
    "( further discussion of the cosmological science enabled by _",
    "planck _ was covered by lloyd knox in his talk at this meeting . ) in particular i want to focus on the dramatic revolution _ planck _",
    "will represent in the study of primary cmb anisotropies and the universe at @xmath1 , with its implications for low-@xmath2 studies such as those of dark energy .",
    "i also want to make a push for a cmb - centric view of structure formation which emphasizes the exquisite constraints on large - scale structure that we already have from the cmb at high-@xmath2 .",
    "before i begin with these science topics , it is important to remind ourselves how revolutionary _ planck _ will be .",
    "in addition to wider frequency coverage ( crucial for control of foregrounds ) and better sensitivity than _ wmap _ , _ planck _ has the resolution needed to see into the damping tail of the anisotropy spectrum . in fact _",
    "planck _ will be the first experiment to make an almost cosmic variance limited measurement of the temperature anisotropy spectrum around the @xmath3 and @xmath4 acoustic peaks .",
    "what does this dramatic increase in our knowledge of the temperature and polarization anisotropy spectra tell us about cosmology , fundamental physics and the formation of structure ? here",
    "i will highlight just a few areas where we expect a large impact .",
    "it is well known that detailed observations of cmb anisotropy , coupled with accurate theoretical predictions , constrain the high redshift universe .",
    "the most strongly constrained is the physics which gives rise to the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum , since that is both where the measurements are most accurate and the structure the most rich . to a first approximation",
    "the acoustic peaks constrain the physical matter density , @xmath5 , the physical baryon density , @xmath6 , and an acoustic scale , @xmath7 or @xmath8 @xcite . from this",
    "we can derive other constraints , for example the distance to last - scattering @xmath9 .",
    "currently we know @xmath9 to about 2% @xcite , with the main source of uncertainty coming not from our knowledge of the peak positions but from the 8% uncertainty in @xmath10 .",
    "this translates into an uncertainty in the expansion rate of the universe near last scattering and hence the distance .",
    "the key to improving our knowledge of @xmath10 is the higher peaks . _",
    "planck _ should determine @xmath10 to @xmath11 @xcite , almost an order of magnitude improvement over current knowledge . in principle",
    "this allows us to determine @xmath9 to @xmath12 !",
    "this provides an important constraint for cosmological models , e.g.  on the dark energy and allows us to calibrate the baryon acoustic oscillation method for measuring @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "why are the higher peaks crucial to constraining the matter density ? to understand this let us consider how the temperature anisotropies are formed .",
    "we know that on small scales the cmb anisotropy spectrum is damped by photon diffusion @xcite . this process is well understood and essentially independent of the source of the anisotropies .",
    "if we remove it we can see the combined effects of the baryon loading and the epoch of equality ( fig .",
    "[ fig : damp ] ) .",
    "the baryons give weight to the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "this makes it easier to fall into a potential well to become a compression and harder to `` bounce '' out to become a rarefaction . for adiabatic models",
    "the baryon loading thus enhances the compressions ( odd peaks ) and weakens the rarefactions ( even peaks ) leading to an alternating sequence of peak heights .",
    "superposed upon this alternation is a general rise in power to small scales  usually obscured by the effects of the exponential silk damping .",
    "the power increase arises because at early times  when the perturbations giving rise to the higher peaks are entering the horizon  the baryon - photon fluid contributes more to the total energy density of the universe than the dark matter .",
    "the effects of baryon - photon self - gravity enhance the fluctuations on small scales as follows @xcite .",
    "since the fluid has pressure it is hard to compress .",
    "this makes the infall into the potential wells slower than free - fall , retarding the growth in the overdensity . because the overdensity can not grow rapidly enough the potential is forced to decay by the expansion of the universe ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : damp ] ) .",
    "the photons are then left in a compressed state with no need to fight against the potential as they leave  enhancing the small scale power .",
    "as the universe expands and larger scales enter the horizon the dark matter potentials become increasingly important and the boost is reduced compared to the low @xmath16 plateau .",
    "the plateau has an amplitude set by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the infall into the potential well and subsequent decay boosts the power by @xmath18 making the small - scale effective temperature perturbation @xmath19 . in reality because of the effects of dark energy and neutrinos the effect is more like a factor of @xmath20 . ] .    thus measuring the higher peaks",
    "constrains the behavior of the potentials , which respond to the expansion rate of the universe near last scattering .",
    "if dark energy is sub - dominant at high @xmath2 this becomes a constraint on the epoch of equality , @xmath21 , or the matter density . since it is able to make an almost cosmic variance limited measurement of the higher acoustic peaks , _ planck _ provides us with an unparalleled constraint on the ( physical ) matter density .",
    "the nature of the dark energy believed to be causing the accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the most important questions facing cosmology , with implications for our understanding of physics at the deepest levels .",
    "for this reason the community has been pursuing dark energy science with a number of different probes .",
    "it is sometimes stated that the cmb does not directly constrain dark energy , and this is true .",
    "however it is important to point out that almost all of the methods which seek to constrain the dark energy do much better if they include information from the cmb .",
    "in fact most analyses include _ wmap _ ( or projected _ planck _ ) priors as a matter of course . as a field",
    "we have not been particularly effective in promoting the importance of improved cmb anisotropy / polarization measurements for future dark energy experiments , so let me take some time to show one example here : baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "the idea behind the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) method is to make measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath14 using a calibrated standard ruler which can be measured at a number of redshifts @xcite .",
    "the cmb provides the calibrated ruler through its measurement of the sound horizon : @xmath22 the sound horizon is extremely well constrained by the structure of the acoustic peaks .",
    "for example from @xcite we find @xmath23 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sdef ] ) the sound horizon depends on the expansion history ( matter - radiation equality ) and the sound speed ( baryon - photon ratio ) . once @xmath24 is known and the angular scale of the peaks , @xmath7 , is measured the distance to last - scattering follows from @xmath25 .",
    "the same physical scale is imprinted upon the matter power spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rms ] ) , and can serve as a calibrated standard ruler at lower @xmath2 .",
    "if we fourier transform the almost harmonic series of peaks seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] we predict that the correlation function should have a single well - defined peak at @xmath26mpc ( see @xcite for a discussion of the physics of the bao in fourier and configuration space ) .",
    "this feature has now been seen by several groups @xcite in both configuration , @xmath27 , and fourier , @xmath28 , space at intermediate redshift , @xmath29 .",
    "this measurement , along with the cmb , is enough to show the existence of dark energy but larger surveys are needed to constrain its properties .      with so much riding on the cmb calibration",
    "it is important to ask what could go wrong ? recall the method hinges on the ability to predict @xmath24 , for which we need @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath14 .",
    "it turns out that recombination is very robust , and our current uncertainties in recombination @xcite lead to shifts in the sound horizon well below a percent .",
    "if we assume the standard radiation content ( @xmath32 nearly massless neutrino species plus photons ) knowing @xmath33 from @xmath34 gives @xmath35 .",
    "then knowing @xmath21 is the same as knowing @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "but what if @xmath35 was different ?",
    "could we mistake @xmath36 for de ?",
    "it turns out that as long as @xmath21 is still known well from the cmb is does nt matter !",
    "we would misestimate @xmath10 however in comparing our standard ruler at @xmath37 and @xmath38 the same @xmath10 prefactor enters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath24 : each scales as @xmath41 .",
    "thus all distance ratios and de inferences go through unchanged @xcite .",
    "what we do is misestimate the overall scale , and hence @xmath42 !",
    "it is ironic that we may end up understanding quantum gravity and the mysterious dark energy but still be uncertain about the hubble constant .",
    "what about more bizarre histories ?",
    "as an example imagine a non - relativistic particle of mass @xmath43 which decays with lifetime @xmath44 into massless neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we arrange @xmath43 and @xmath44 so that there is 10% more radiation today than in the standard model , but increase @xmath10 by 10% so that equality is held fixed . since it is equality that primarily controls the decay of the potentials at early times the cmb fluctuations",
    "look very similar .",
    "however , because the universe would be slightly more matter dominated at early times ( when the massive particle was a non - negligible contribution to the total energy density ) we would expect excess power on small scales , and we can shift the acoustic peaks .",
    "can this lead to a false signature of dark energy ?",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : decneut ] the mass and cmb temperature power spectra for a sequence of models with @xmath45 , 3 and 4 . while one can see subtle shifts in the sound horizon , any model which appreciably shifts @xmath24 changes the temperature anisotropies at high @xmath16 enough to be easily seen by _",
    "planck_. thus while one may not be able to fit the spectrum with a standard model , one would not mistake strange physics at @xmath38 for dark energy at @xmath46 .      to recap the main points of this section , _ planck _ will dramatically improve our knowledge of the physical conditions in the universe at @xmath38 .",
    "the physical matter and baryon densities and the distance to last - scattering will be known to sub - percent accuracy .",
    "the epoch of equality will be tightly constrained , as will extra species , anisotropic stresses and decaying components at high redshift @xcite .",
    "already with _ wmap _ , and certainly after _ planck _ , we will have very precise knowledge of the universe at @xmath1 .",
    "we will have tightly constrained the densities of matter and baryons , the amplitude of the fluctuations in the linear phase over 3 decades in length scale and the shape of the primordial power spectrum . _",
    "our knowledge of the physical conditions and large - scale structure at @xmath1 will be better than our knowledge of such quantities at @xmath47 .",
    "_ one should not ignore this dramatic advance in our knowledge  when forecasting the future we should hold the @xmath1 universe `` fixed '' , not the @xmath47 one .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing strong cmb priors on future measurements .    as an example , knowing @xmath10 and @xmath48 allows us to predict the shape of the linear theory ( matter ) power spectrum extremely accurately over many orders of magnitude in length scale , providing that the lengths are measured in mpc ( or meters ) rather than @xmath49mpc as would be more familiar from low-@xmath2 measurements .",
    "note that knowing @xmath10 and @xmath21 fixes @xmath14 at high-@xmath2 @xmath50 the amplitude of the fluctuations is well constrained by anisotropy measurements , up to a degeneracy with @xmath44  the constrained quantity is roughly @xmath51 . further , unless dark energy is important at @xmath52 , we can evolve the fluctuations reliably from @xmath38 to lower @xmath2 , since @xmath53 for most of the time . in combination",
    "this enables us to constrain the high-@xmath2 matter power spectrum ( with lengths measured in _ physical _ units ) .",
    "for example fig .",
    "[ fig : matdelk ] shows the range of matter power spectra at @xmath54 allowed by the _ wmap _",
    "3yr data assuming a standard @xmath55cdm model and that dark energy is negligible for @xmath56 .",
    "the error bars expand slightly at high-@xmath57 if we additionally allow massive neutrinos , but near the scales contributing to the first acoustic peak ( @xmath58 ) the constraint is already 7% in power .",
    "half of the uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the optical depth , @xmath44 .",
    "if we remove that degeneracy the constraint becomes 3% in power or 1.5% in amplitude !",
    "we expect this to improve with future _ wmap _ data , but with _ planck _ the uncertainty will drop to sub - percent levels even with improved modeling of the reionization epoch . thus in a post-_planck _ world the uncertainty in large - scale structure comes from the extrapolation from @xmath59 to @xmath47 ( which depends on the nature of the dark energy ) and the conversion between physical distances and redshift space measures ( which depend on @xmath60 ) .",
    "the former lead to vertical shifts in the spectrum , while the latter give horizontal shifts .",
    "_ planck _ will provide a dramatic advance in our knowledge of primary and secondary cmb anisotropies .",
    "the constraints on many key cosmological parameters will be dropped to percent , or sub - percent , levels and the shape and amplitude of the mass power spectrum at high redshift will be tightly constrained . beyond our desire to know the basic parameters of the universe accurately , and to perform truly precision tests of our cosmological model ,",
    "the increase in precision will be important for a host of low redshift experiments , including those that aim to constrain the nature of the dark energy .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of this conference for a pleasant and productive meeting , and daniel eisenstein and wayne hu for conversations and collaborations upon which some of this work rests .",
    "i am grateful to the many members of the _ planck _ collaboration who have labored tirelessly to make _ planck _ a reality , and especially to charles lawrence for his leadership and tireless enthusiasm  and the chocolate donuts .",
