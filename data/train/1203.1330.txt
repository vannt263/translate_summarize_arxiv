    "with the recent advent of the _ fermi _  mission , the @xmath0-ray astronomy is living a new golden age with several striking discoveries already performed during the first three years .    according to the second _",
    "fermi _  @xmath0-ray lat catalog ( 2fgl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ fermi _   detected 1873 sources , 576 of which are still unidentified even if the localization of the @xmath0-ray sources has significantly improved with respect to the past @xmath0-ray missions .",
    "for this reason , despite the large number of new discoveries already achieved , the nature of the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources is still an open question .",
    "this unsolved issue is extremely relevant for the origin of the isotropic gamma - ray background , since , given the large number of unidentified @xmath0-ray sources , new classes of unknown extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources that can significantly contribute to the isotropic gamma - ray background could be hidden .",
    "on the other hand , the most detected @xmath0-ray sources in the mev - gev energy range belong to the rarest class of active galactic nuclei , the blazars .",
    "they are an intriguing class of active galactic nuclei , characterized by non - thermal radiation emitted over the entire electromagnetic spectrum , and interpreted as arising from a relativistic jet closely aligned to the line of sight ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "blazars come in two flavors : the bl lac objects and the flat spectrum radio quasars , where the common discriminating criterion between the two classes is the equivalent width of the optical emission lines , traditionally weaker than 5@xmath2 in the former rather than in the latter @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we indicate the bl lacs as bzbs and the flat spectrum radio quasars as bzqs , according to the roma - bzcat nomenclature @xcite .    recently , using the preliminary data release of the _ wise _  infrared ( ir ) survey @xcite , we discovered that ir color - color diagrams allows us to distinguish between extragalactic sources dominated by non - thermal emission , like blazars , and other classes of galaxies and/or active galactic nuclei ( massaro et al .",
    "2011 , hereinafter paper i , see also plotkin et al .",
    "in particular , the blazar population delineates a tight , distinct region of the ir color space , indicated as the _ wise _  blazar strip ( paper i ) .",
    "the _ wise _  blazar strip is a region in the 3d infrared color space delineated by the blazar population .",
    "this region is narrower when considering only the ir colors of the blazars that are detected in the @xmath0-rays , indicated as the _ wise _  gamma - ray strip ( wgs , see * ? ? ?",

    "one of the major difficulties of the association procedures for the _ fermi _  @xmath0-ray sources with active galactic nuclei is that , due to the lack of radio and x - ray informations and to the large uncertainty on the @xmath0-ray position , it is not always possible to recognize if there is a blazar candidate within the positional error region .",
    "thus , the main aim of this paper is to build a parametrization of the wgs  in order to verify whenever @xmath0-ray sources have been associated to a counterpart that is a blazar candidate , being consistent with the wgs . in particular",
    ", we studied the _ wise _",
    "counterparts of the active galactic nuclei of uncertain type ( agus ) , defined according to the 2fgl and the 2lac criteria @xcite , and their consistency with the wgs .",
    "the agus are defined as the radio and/or x - ray counterparts of @xmath0-ray sources associated to by the 2fgl likelihood ratio method , but without a good optical spectrum that enable their classification @xcite .",

    "our conclusions are discussed in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the sample of @xmath0-ray emitting blazars already selected in paper ii to parametrize the wgs .",
    "this sample was selected from the 2fgl , that contains 805 sources associated with a blazar : 435 bzbs and 370 bzqs respectively .",
    "however only 659 ( 347 bzbs and 312 bzqs ) of these are listed and classified according to the criteria used in the roma - bzcat ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we excluded from our analysis all the blazars with a _ fermi _  analysis flag , according to the 2fgl and the 2lac @xcite .",
    "in particular , 329 ( 164 bzbs and 165 bzqs ) blazars , out of the original 659 , lie in the portion of the sky reported in the _ wise _  preliminary source catalog , but only 296 ( 143 bzbs and 153 bzqs ) have a _ wise _",

    ", we excluded from our analysis 12 blazars ( 8 bzbs and 4 bzqs ) with respect to the 296 blazars in sample selected in paper ii , because they have a 95% upper limit on the _ wise _  magnitude at 22 @xmath3 m .",
    "then , we use this 2fb sample composed of the 284 blazars ( 135 bzbs and 149 bzqs ) to build the wgs  parametrization .",
    "we notice that all the selected blazars also belong the 2lac sample @xcite .    according to the classification available in roma - bzcat",
    "the blazars of uncertain type have been excluded from our analysis , while the bl lac candidates have been considered as bzbs .",
    "more details about the 2fb sample and the source selections are given in paper ii .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our selection is based only on @xmath0-ray blazars that belong to the roma - bzcat because this is the largest catalog of blazars available in literature in which each source is spectroscopically classified at optical frequencies .",

    "sources detected with a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 7 in at least one band .",
    "the positional coincidences of blazars in the observed _ wise _  sky have been searched within a circular region of radius 2.4@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to the combination of the error of 1@xmath4 , assumed for the radio position reported in the roma - bzcat @xcite and taking into account of astrometric uncertainties in the _ wise _  preliminary data , and the positional error of the fourth _ wise _  band at 22@xmath3 m ( i.e. , 1.4@xmath4 ) ( see also paper i ) .",

    "however , including the errors on both axes , it is represented by a cross with 4 _ extremal points _ , calculated considering the @xmath151@xmath6 error on each color .",
    "then , we can define five different type of sources , according to the schematic view shown in figure  [ fig : scheme ] :    * _ type 4 _ : sources with all the extremal points within the wgs  projection ; * _ type 3 _ : sources for which only 3 extremal points lie within the region of the wgs ; * _ type 2 _ : sources with only two extremal points consistent with the wgs ; * _ type 1 _ : sources with only a single extremal point associated with the wgs ; * _ type 0 _ : sources without extremal points of the error cross on the wgs .",
    "we can assign to each type of source a _ discrete strip parameter _",
    "@xmath16 ranging between 0 and 1 , according to the scheme illustrated in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath11-@xmath12 projection of the wgs , we assign to type 4 sources a value @xmath17=1 , while source of type 0 corresponds to @xmath17=0 .",
    "for the same 2d projection , the intermediate values have been assigned as follows : type 3 have @xmath17=0.75 , type 2 have @xmath17=0.5 and type 1 @xmath17=0.25 .    on the same @xmath11-@xmath12 diagram",

    "-@xmath12 2d projection in arbitrary units ( a.u . ) .",
    "we report the method described in section  [ sec : parameter ] to assign to each point of the 2d projection of the wgs  a value of the _ discrete strip parameter _ @xmath17 and the associated value of the _ weight strip parameter _ @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath20 for each given source ( see equation  [ eq : main]).,width=321,height=253 ]    we repeated the entire procedure described above for each 2d projection of the wgs : @xmath11-@xmath12 , @xmath12-@xmath22 and @xmath11-@xmath22 , generating the values of the continuos strip parameters @xmath20 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , respectively . then , all these values of the strip parameters for three different 2d projections have been combined together to define an unique _ total strip parameter _",
    "the _ total strip parameter _ is the geometric average of the @xmath1 values of each 2d projection : @xmath25 we emphasize that sources that lie outside of the wgs  in at least one of its 2d projection have one of the correspondent @xmath26 parameter equal to zero and consequently the total @xmath1 value is null as well .",
    "this occurs because the discrete @xmath16 parameter is zero for sources outside the wgs  ( see figure  [ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "we divided all the @xmath1 parameters for the maximum @xmath1 values of the bzbs and bzqs that lie on the wgsto re - normalize @xmath1 in the range 0 and 1 .",
    "this re - normalization can be applied to the @xmath1 values of all the _ wise _  sources , because those outside the wgswill have @xmath1 null by definition .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter represents an estimate of the _ distance _ , in the ir colors parameter space and weighted with the errors on each axes , between the wgs  and a generic _ wise _  source , that could potentially belong to it ; this @xmath1 parameter is different from zero only in the case in which the all color error bars of a _ wise _  source are consistent with the wgs .",
    "therefore these @xmath1 values can be used to rank each ir _ wise _  source according to their _ association _ to the wgs .    finally , we note that to test if a generic _ wise _  source has ir colors consistent with the bzbs or with the bzqs subregion of the wgs , the total strip parameters are indicated as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",

    "these sources do not have upper limits on their _ wise _  magnitude values and are detected with a signal to noise ratio @xmath31 7 in at least one band as for the blazars in the 2fb sample .",

    "consequently , regarding the choice of the threshold values for the @xmath1 parameters , we preferred the efficiency to the completeness of our method selecting the @xmath1 limiting values from their distributions in low galactic latitude regions , even if this choice could increase the possible contamination of the wgs",

    "this plot suggests that the origin of the wgs  is not due to a selection of bright ir blazars .",
    "-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath3 m when only bright ir blazars are considered ( i.e. , those with _ wise _  magnitudes in the ranges : @xmath4113.5 , @xmath4212 , @xmath4311 , @xmath447.5 , respctively).,width=332,height=241 ]    we also compared the wgs  as formed by the blazars present in the 2fgl and those detected in the first _ fermi _  lat catalog ( 1fgl ) @xcite , and again we did not find any clear difference between the wgs  drawn with the bright or the faint @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "this again suggests that the relation between the wgs  and the @xmath0-ray detectability is related to the blazar spectral shape ( see figure  [ fig:1fgl ] for the standard 2d projection in [ 3.4]-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath3 m color diagram ) .",
    "-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath3 m when only bright @xmath0-ray blazars listed in the 1fgl ( black ) are considered in comparison with those in the 2fgl ( red ) .",
    "there are no clear differences on the thickness of the wgs  in this 2d projection due to the different samples considered.,width=332,height=241 ]    on the basis of the wgs  parametrization presented in this paper , the above issues will be deeply addressed in future works , after the full release of the _ wise _  all - sky survey .",
    "on the basis of the recent results on the characterization of the ir colors of blazars provided by _ wise _   ( paper i ) and on the comparison with their @xmath0-ray emission ( paper ii ) , we developed a method based the _ wise _",
    "blazar strip to identify blazar counterparts of @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "we developed a method to parametrize the wgs  in the 3d color diagrams based on its 2d projections .",
    "this method is characterized by the use a continuos parameter @xmath1 , in the range 0  1 , that takes into account of the errors of all the ir colors and provides clues on the position of a generic _ wise _  source relative to the wgs  in the 3d color parameter space .",
    "high values of the @xmath1 parameters are associated to sources that lie inside the wgs(as the @xmath0-ray blazar population of the 2fb sample ) .",
    "the wgs  has been parametrized in two subregions , the first containing the bzbs while the other with the bzqs although in the present work we are only interest in searching for blazar counterparts that lie on the wgs .",
    "we applied our parametrization to the sample of the agus selected from the 2fgl and the 2lac .",
    "we found that there are 148 agus that can be analyzed within the footprint of the _ wise _  preliminary source catalog .",
    "however , according to our association procedure ( see secton  [ sec : associations ] ) only 60 agus have a unique _ wise _",
    "counterpart without any upper limit on the _ wise _  magnitude values .",
    "then , we calculated the distributions of their @xmath1 parameter and found that 54 out of 60 agus analyzed are consistent with the wgs , corresponding to the 90% of the @xmath0-ray counterparts analyzed while the remaining 6 agu counterparts are outliers of the wgs .",
    "in particular , for the 54 agus that are consistent with the wgs  we also found that the correlation between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 is in agreement with that found for the blazars that constitute the wgs  itself while the same correlation for the 6 outliers is inconsistent with it .",
    "we also applied the kde non - parametric test to obtain the probability that an agu counterpart belong to the wgs  and we found consistent results with our parametrization ( see section  [ sec : kde ] for more details ) .",
    "in addition , an extensive investigation of all the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources in the 2fgl that fall in the area of the sky where the _ wise _   preliminary data have been already released will be provided in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "searching for blazar candidates within the unidentified @xmath0-ray source sample could potentially leading to the discovery new class of @xmath0-ray emitting sources .",
    "further improvements of the wgs  parametrization will be also possible in the future , when the whole _ wise _",
    "catalog will be available and this parametric method would be calibrated at different @xmath29 values not only to look for counterparts of @xmath0-ray sources but also to search for new blazar candidates all over the sky @xcite .",
