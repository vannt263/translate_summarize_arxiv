    "thermal fluctuations will exert a significant effect on this configuration only if the circumference of the circle is greater than the temperature - dependent persistence length of this segment . when the looped rod is also forced to undergo a twist ,",
    "the circular shape may prove to be unstable .",
    "the rod will then either distort into a non - planar , non - intersecting form , or it may wind about itself , in an interwound , or `` plectonemic , '' configuration @xcite .",
    "when torsional and flexing stresses are not too severe , @xcite the dna molecule can be modeled as such a rod .",
    "a short enough segment of looped dna will thus take on shapes determined by the minization of elastic energy .",
    "planar shapes , characteristic of `` relaxed '' dna have been observed , as have the plectonemic forms when the molecule is over - or underwound .",
    "the distortion , or supercoiling , of dna under the influence of torsional stresses is widely believed to have significant implications with respect to the action of this molecule in biological settings @xcite .",
    "that this is so may be inferred from the existence of enzymes known as topoisomerases , which act to facilitate the alteration of the torsional characteristics of dna configurations @xcite .",
    "the elastic model of dna has been the subject of intense research in the past 30 years .",
    "theoretical appraches to this problem include lagrangian mechanics@xcite , b - splines and ( numerical ) molecular dynamics @xcite , and statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "only recently has it been possible to determine the equilibrium configuration of a closed segment of dna , as modeled by distorted rod@xcite .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the properties of these equilibrium configurations has not yet been published .    in this paper",
    "we contribute to the knowledge of this configuration by describing a method by which one can obtain the shape of a closed section of an elastic rod , along with various key properties of this system , including its twist , writhe , linking number and energy .",
    "we will use this formalism to generate both unknotted and knotted forms of closed dna .",
    "we will also outline how our formalism can be exploited to produce other shapes of interest to dna researchers .",
    "the configurations that will be discussed include those that arise as a result of the the supercoiling instability for a closed loop .",
    "we will also examine the configurations that represent the evolution of higher energy deformation of a circular loop .",
    "in addition , we will briefly discuss configurations that are associated with knotted loops .",
    "such knots include , but are not limited to , the trefoil .",
    "all the more elaborate configurations are unstable with respect to fluctuations about the solutions that extremize the energy of the loop .",
    "however , it is possible to envision mechanisms , analogous to those leading to the nuclesome structure @xcite , that stabilize these configurations and , therefore , cause them to be relevant to biological systems .    as noted about",
    ", we will discuss the mechanical stability of the configurations to be studied , and will present results with regard to the contribution to the free energy of thermal fluctuations about the minimizing shape .",
    "these results will be relevant as long as thermal fluctuations do not give rise to a significantly alteration of the shape that the rod takes , and , as noted above , if the circumference of the rod is not large compared to the rod s persistence length . the precise criterion for this",
    "will be examined later on in this paper .",
    "the most important advance in the work presented here is the algorithm for the generation of various closed structures and the analysis of the stability of the configurations , particularly the one associated with the principal supercoiling instability . on the basis of the stability analysis , it is clear that only some of the configurations that one can generate with the use of the methods described in this paper are , in and of themselves , mechanically stable .",
    "however , the existence of devices that support non - interwound supercoiled configurations in the case of open strands of dna @xcite allow one to speculate as to the possible relevance of those configurations to dna in biological settings .",
    "furthermore , one can envision utilizing these methods in conjunction with other calculational tools to study the mechanical properties and packing configurations of longer strands of dna .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the mechanical model is described and important parameters are defined . of especial importance is an identification of the parameters that will be adjusted in order to obtain solutions of the energy extremum equations .",
    "key quantities , including topological invariants , will be defined in terms of those parameters .",
    "the stability of the circular configuration of a closed rod under torsional stress is then assessed .",
    "the principal instability is identified , and it is shown how to obtain the family of closed curves that represent the evolution of this instability .",
    "this family interpolates between the circle and a figure eight , that latter of which lies at the onset of interwinding .",
    "the stability of the members of this class is then assessed .",
    "it is found that they are , indeed , stable against small fluctuations .",
    "then , it is shown that the method by which the outcome of the supercoiling instability is investigated can be utilized to generate deformed configurations , among which are configurations in which the closed loop is also knotted .",
    "finally , there is a brief discussion of the way in which the contributions of fluctuations about the classical solution configurations .",
    "details and background are relegated to appendices .",
    "in previous work we have outlined some developments in the elastic model of dna@xcite .",
    "the molecule is represented as a slender cylindrical elastic rod . at each point @xmath0 the rod is characterized by relating the local coordinate frame @xmath1 to the frame @xmath2 rigidly embedded in the curve in its relaxed configuration .",
    "the relationship between the stressed and unstressed local frames is specified by euler angles @xmath3 needed to rotate @xmath4 into @xmath5 .",
    "we begin by summarizing some of the results needed for this paper .",
    "we denote the elastic constants of bending and torsional stiffness by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the length of the rod is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the elastic energy is given by @xmath9 the `` dot '' notation for derivatives is used interchangeably with the explicit derivative with respect to arc - length , @xmath10 .",
    "the twist is given by @xmath11 a relevant result from our previous work is that @xmath12 , the linking number , can be written as @xmath13 where we have used fuller s theorem@xcite to obtain the writhe , and white s theorem@xcite for the total link .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is an integer that encodes the knotting of the loop .",
    "it is equal to the number of signed crossings of the loop , assuming that it has been flattened out as much as possible .",
    "as a precursor to the discussion of the possible deformations of a closed loop , we review the family of excitations of a closed , circular loop , and the conditions under which this configurations may become unstable to one or more of these excitations .",
    "detailed discussion of these issues has been relegated to appendices [ sec : genstab ] and [ sec : circfluc ] .",
    "the appendices also contain derivations of key formulas presented below .",
    "the excitation of a circular loop is describable in terms of the deviation of the euler angle @xmath15 from the constant value of @xmath16 that it has in the case of a circle .",
    "if we write @xmath17 , then small excitations about a circular shape will be of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an integer ( possibly 0 ) and @xmath20 is an arbitrary phase factor .",
    "the energy of such a sinusoidal excitation proportional to @xmath21    the requirement that the fluctuations leave the loop closed and , also , that they not change the linking number of the loop rule out @xmath22 and @xmath23 as possibilities .",
    "the allowed deformation with the smallest energy has @xmath24 . substituting this value into eq .",
    "( [ enform1 ] ) , we find for the energy cost of this excitation @xmath25 it is clear that this deformation of the circle can give rise to a lowering of the energy .",
    "this state of affairs holds if @xmath26 in fact , the condition in eq .",
    "( [ supcoil1 ] ) is just the requirement for the supercoiling instability of the closed loop .",
    "deformations associated with higher values of @xmath19 lower the energy of the loop when the condition @xmath27 holds .",
    "it is clear that the instability with the earliest onset , and the one that will prove dynamically `` strongest '' is the one with threshold as given by ( [ supcoil1 ] ) .",
    "we start by looking for a family of closed solutions to the euler - lagrange equations that represent the evolution of the deformation associated with the supercoiling instability , _ i.e. _ @xmath24 in eqs ( [ flucform1 ] ) and ( [ enform1 ] ) above .",
    "this family of curves can be indexed by the writhe , @xmath28 , of a member , which ranges from @xmath29 for a simple circle to @xmath30 of the other limiting member of the family , a `` figure eight . ''",
    "the actual constraint imposed on the closed curves that are of relevance to this discussion is that the link is fixed at a predetermined value .",
    "we shall therefore examine the conditions under which the family of writhing curves can satisfy the imposition of a linking number      our goal is to extremize elastic energy and keep the curve closed .",
    "the functional to consider for closed configurations of dna is @xmath31 the first term of ( [ c_hamil_eqn ] ) is clear  the elastic energy must be extremized .",
    "the second term enforces the constraint that the curve minimizing the elastic energy also closes upon itself . in general",
    ", one expects to introduce lagrange multipliers controlling the extent of the curve in all directions .",
    "however , one can concentrate on the net displacement in only the @xmath32 direction , because it is always possible to transform to a a reference frame in which the curve is closed in the @xmath33 plane .",

    "the equation for @xmath15 is a quadrature obtained by integrating @xmath38 with @xmath39 as the constant of integration . defining @xmath40 we see that the behavior of solutions is governed by a cubic polynomial in @xmath41 : @xmath42 where we order the roots @xmath43 .",

    ", there are two complete ocillations as the the closed curve is traversed once .",
    "all the relevant quantities , including the shape of the curve , can be obtained using ( [ theta_eqn ] ) .",
    "for example : @xmath47 the key to the solution of the equation for the distorted closed loop is the determination of the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath46 and @xmath45 .      to complete the analysis",
    "we must determine the parameters generated by the minimization procedure .",
    "one choice of parameters is the set of invariants @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the constant @xmath39 , and the lagrange multiplier @xmath48 . however , as indicated above , a better practical choice is the lagrange multiplier @xmath48 and the parameters @xmath49 , @xmath46 and @xmath45 . to determine the parameters we impose constraints on the curve .",
    "figure [ segment_fig ] is a good visual guide to the geometric meaning of the constraints .",
    "they are    1 .",
    "the loop closes on itself in the @xmath32-direction . because the curve consists of four segments , in each of which the variable @xmath52 goes from @xmath46 to @xmath45 , or from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , we have @xmath53 2 .",
    "the loop goes through one quarter of a turn in each segment .",
    "this reduces to @xmath54 3 .",
    "the linking number takes on a predetermined value for the loop .",
    "this requirement leads to the following mathematical constraint on the solution to the euler lagrange equations .",
    "@xmath55 4 .",
    "finally , the length of the loop takes on a predetermined value .",
    "mathematically , @xmath56 the above condition is not as tautological as it seems .",
    "the actual parameterization of the curve will be in terms of the dependence of quantities on the cosine of the euler angle @xmath57 .",
    "at this point we reparameterize the problem in terms of @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 . parametrizing",
    "the problem by the roots of the polynomial is extremely advantageous : it makes the analytic manipulations more transparent ; it also streamlines the computational tasks .",
    "the two sets of parameters are related in the following manner : @xmath60^{1/2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the choice of branch ( @xmath61 ) is imposed by the family of configurations sought . for circular dna without intrinsic curvature , @xmath50 takes a @xmath62 , and @xmath51 correspondingly a @xmath63 .",
    "let us make some definitions that render the notation more transparent : @xmath64 employing ( [ c_quadrature_eqn ] ) we rewrite the constraint equations , ( [ zclosure ] ) , ( [ phiequation ] ) , and ( [ lengthconstraint1 ] ) , in terms of the new parameters : @xmath65 \\label{c_phi_constraint}\\\\ & & f=\\frac{32a}{\\delta a l^2}k\\left(q\\right)\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\label{c_f_constraint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 are complete elliptic integrals of the first , second and third kind , respectively .",
    "the issue of the constraint on linking number will be left for later discussion .",
    "we find that the optimal procedure for calculation of parameters appropriate to a solution is to utilize ( [ c_f_constraint ] ) to eliminate @xmath48 , then ( [ c_a_constraint ] ) and ( [ c_phi_constraint ] ) eliminate @xmath67 and @xmath45 . because the writhe , @xmath28 , is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath68",
    ", we make use of this property to classify distinguish between the members of a family of curves .",
    "once the constants @xmath58 are determined , the desired solutions and all the relevant quantities are computed via elliptic integrals .",
    "for example , the explicit expression for @xmath57 in the first quarter of oscillation is ( we have inverted ( [ c_quadrature_eqn ] ) ) : @xmath69 @xmath70 are obtained similarly from ( [ c_phi_eqn ] ) and ( [ c_psi_eqn ] ) .",
    "figure [ circle_family_fig ] displays the family of curves computed in the manner discussed above .",
    "since the constraint equations involve elliptic integrals , finding a solution on a computer is virtually instanteneous ; analytically and computationally elliptic integrals are equivalent to , say , @xmath71 .",
    "let us check whether the initial member of our family , a circle with @xmath29 joins smoothly with the previously known stable family of twisted circles@xcite .",
    "the circle corresponds to @xmath29 . a circle in the @xmath33 plane the curve must have @xmath72 . ( [ c_phi_constraint ] )",
    "now states that    @xmath73    combining ( [ tw_eqn ] ) and ( [ c_psi_eqn ] ) to obtain the twist , @xmath74 , of the circle ( [ p_circle_equation ] ) gives @xmath75    it is also of interest to compute the @xmath76 of the figure eight , which , like the circle , can be performed virtually by inspection .",

    "the value of @xmath82 is easily determined from the fact that @xmath83 ( this can be seen from the curve itself ) necessitating @xmath84 . then ( [ c_phi_constraint ] ) yields @xmath85 .",
    "we have found a family of writhing solutions that are the extrema of elastic energy .",
    "the writhe of the curves covers the range @xmath86 . just before crossing can be seen from the shape of the curve .",

    "the loop remains a circle until @xmath91 .",
    "after that there are three possibilities . if @xmath92 then the writhing family supports a steady increase to the linking number limit @xmath93 of the figure eight and the molecule folds continuously until self - crossing occurs .",
    "further increase of @xmath88 presumably results in a plectonemic configuration .",
    "if @xmath94 the one can expect the curve to distort continuously until the writhe achieves some value intermediate between zero and one .",

    "an interesting fact is that this behavior is _ independent _ of the length of the molecule . that this ought to be so follows from the absence of an absolute length scale in the problem of the deformed loop .",
    "greater insight into the behavior of the deforming loop is gained if one also investigates the way in which the energy depends on the various properties of the loop .",

    "a few facts about the energies of the deformed configuration can be established numerically ( and we do not doubt that analytic demonstrations can also be constructed ) .",
    "first , the energy is a monotonically increasing function of linking number , if not of writhe .",

    "furthermore , when there is a maximum in link as a function of writhe , there is also an energy maximum , and , as indicated in figures [ link_family_fig ] and [ fig : energyplot ] , the maxima occur at the same value of the writhe .",
    "in addition , when there is a maximum in the linking number as the writhe increases from zero to one , so that there are two possible writhes associated with the same linking number in for a range of the latter quantity , the configuration with the lower writhe always has the lower energy .",
    "this can be established by a separate set of calculations .",
    "this implies that when , for instance , @xmath102 , the loop , in distorting from its planar form , will not be susceptible to a discontinuous distortion to a more highly writhed , but not interwound , configuration before it `` snaps '' to a plectoneme . in the absence of thermal fluctuations or external perturbations , that transition will to occur when the link has reached its maximum value as a function of writhe .    for a more detailed discussion of the energetics of the deforming loop , along with a calcuation of the energy of the plectoneme",

    "given the existence of the solutions for the deformed loop corresponding to the evolution of the supercoiling instability , it is desirable to determine whether these solutions are , themselves , stable against small fluctuations .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ guarantee that this is so .",
    "we will find , in fact , that the stability of the closed configuration is enforced by the relatively large number of constraints that must be satisfied by fluctuations about the extremizing solutions to the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "a number of technical details associated with the determination of the stability of a configuration are to be found in various appendices .",
    "the energy of a fluctuation about a solution to the euler - lagrange equation is expressible in terms of solutions to the linear second order differential equation ( [ schrod1 ] ) , equivalent to the schrdinger equation of a particle in the potential ( [ potential1 ] ) . in particular , any fluctuation , @xmath103 of the euler angle @xmath57 about the form it takes in an extremizing solution can be written in the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a solution to eq .",
