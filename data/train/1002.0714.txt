    "nanomechanical resonators and nanoelectromechanical systems are widely used in a multitude of applications such as ultrafast actuation and sensing at the zeptogram and sub - attonewton scales  @xcite . the extraordinary sensitivity that such nems provide rely mainly upon their very high oscillating pulsations and quality factors @xmath0 . however , while @xmath0 factors in the tens or hundreds of thousands can be obtained in vacuum and/or cryogenic environment , these values degrade dramatically in liquid and gas phases meaning that much more work is still to be done to reach the technological level ( see however  @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to characterize more precisely the viscous forces exerted by fluids on the vibrating motion of nems and this constitutes the motivation for the present work .",
    "+ over the last years , micro- and nano - fluidics experiments @xcite reported that the physical properties of fluids flowing into or around confined systems , such as nano - channels  @xcite , are strongly modified compared with those encountered at the micro and macro scales .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the usual no - slip boundary conditions , which are universally used since the @xmath1 century to model the behavior of newtonian fluids at a solid interface , break down at the nano scale  @xcite .",
    "such modifications of boundary conditions are also expected to have a huge impact on nems dynamics since properties known for microelectromechanical systems ( mems )  @xcite can not simply be scaled down to the nano realm .",
    "+ in a recent work , we investigated the importance of gas damping on a thermally actuated microlever as it is gradually approached towards an infinite wall in parallel geometry  @xcite .",
    "the experiment performed at room temperature in air showed that the sub - angstrom lever oscillation amplitude , i.e. , in the direction perpendicular to the parallel planes , is completely frozen as the gap @xmath2 is progressively decreased from 20 @xmath3 m to 400 nm .",

    ", the reported results are qualitatively and quantitatively well understood if one accepts the perfect - slip boundary conditions for which friction at the lever / gas interface is prohibited .",
    "+ the aim of the present article is twofold",
    ". first , we study theoretically the motion of the newtonian fluid , i.e. air , around the oscillating micro plate . starting with the linearized navier - stokes equation",
    "we analytically show that perfect slip boundary conditions lead to the correct dynamical behavior reported experimentally in ref .",
    "we compare our findings with the other more traditional approaches based on the no - slip boundary conditions and show that they necessarily conflict with the experimental facts . during the analysis we also discuss the different possible boundary conditions and in particular the impact of the slip length of the beam dynamical behavior .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to show the important implications that our findings may have on the engineering and architecture of future nems operating in gaseous environment . here , on the basis of the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a model system we discuss precisely the existence of a critical overdamped regime for nems oscillating in fluids and study the influence of materials , geometrical , and intrinsic dynamical properties on this regime .",

    "iii the static regime corresponding to various slip lengths and valid for small gap values is studied analytically and compared ( successfully ) with the experimental results reported in ref .",

    "in particular , we compare the calculations obtained here for the plane - plane geometry to those already obtained in the sphere - plane configuration by taylor and vinogradova  @xcite . finally , in sec .  v we discuss the consequences of our findings for nems dynamics .",

    "this system is modelled as a parallelepiped with length @xmath4 , width @xmath5 and thickness @xmath6 .",
    "the lever is clamped by one end and oscillates mainly along the @xmath7 direction ( see fig .  1 ) .    ,",

    "as we will now show this law results directly from the perfect slip boundary conditions applied to the navier - stokes equation , and it differs from the usual @xmath16 behavior deduced by considering the no slip conditions  @xcite .",

    "first , the importance of the non - linear term @xmath21 can be estimated from the knowledge of the reynolds number @xmath22 calculated for a characteristic length @xmath23 and fluid velocity @xmath24 ( @xmath25 m@xmath26/s is the kinematic viscosity ) . in the present context",

    "we therefore assume that the lever is a horizontal plate vibrating along the z direction . the lever oscillating at the frequency @xmath34 @xmath35hz one obtains @xmath36 m / s and thus with @xmath37 @xmath3 m @xmath38 as a consequence of this ultra - small reynolds number we will completely neglect nonlinearity in the rest of this work . as a corollary of this analysis we also deduce the mach number @xmath39 ( @xmath40 sound velocity in air ) . the vanishing value of @xmath41 justifies the fluid incompressibility hypothesis @xmath42 .",

    "neglect the dynamic term .",
    "+ in order to solve the linearized navier - stokes equation @xmath50 one must provide the precise boundary conditions for the fluid velocity at the solid interfaces .",
    "the condition for the normal component of the velocity is quite obvious  @xcite . indeed , since the fluid can not go through a solid interface the fluid velocity @xmath51 must equal the velocity of the plate @xmath12 at @xmath52 and must also vanish along the surface @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "however , the precise form of the conditions for the tangential components @xmath54 and @xmath55 is not so natural and is a subject of debates and controversies since the birth of hydrodynamics  @xcite . the problem was already well addressed by navier  @xcite who introduced the two most known possibilities which are respectively the no - slip and perfect slip boundary conditions . following the no - slip hypothesis the fluid velocity along the interface must equal the in - plane velocity of the solid boundary . in the present case the no - slip conditions lead to @xmath56 along the substrate plane @xmath53 and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 along the cantilever interface at @xmath52 . the no - slip hypothesis is well documented in the literature and experimentally justified at the macroscale  @xcite .",
    "it leads however to increasing difficulties and contradictions in the micro and nanofluidic regime where fundamental and statistical properties of molecules such as the mean free path and the surface roughness can not be ignored  @xcite .",
    "+ the second extreme possibility , the perfect slip boundary conditions , suppose having @xmath59 ( from now on we use the notation @xmath60 ) along the solid interface .",
    "these are reminiscent for conditions on the viscous stress tensor @xmath61 meaning that no tangential friction is allowed between fluid and solid .",
    "we however point out that the equivalence between the relations @xmath62 and @xmath59 assume the additional conditions @xmath63 which implies that @xmath51 does not depend on @xmath64 in the vicinity of the solid boundary ( this is obviously true on the interface provided that the boundary conditions on @xmath51 are fulfilled ) .",
    "beyond these two extreme cases more realistic approaches were proposed to take into account a possible partial slip at the boundary .",
    "in particular navier  @xcite suggested the existence of a surface friction force law @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a unit vector normal to the surface and oriented outwardly from the solid to the fluid and @xmath67 a dissipative coefficient . with the same assumptions as before this leads to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the so called slip length .",
    "this law has been considerably studied in the recent years with the advent of micro and nanofluidics  @xcite .",
    ".  [ slipl ] has been confirmed many times in particular for liquid flows in nanochannels  @xcite .",
    "however , the measurements of the associated slip length @xmath69 reveals a broad spectrum of values which specifically depend on the system considered  @xcite .",
    "this shows that only a microscopic analysis could lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon . keeping this point for latter discussions we will here apply the law given by eq .",

    "reynolds considered two disks approaching each other with a constant velocity @xmath72 along their common axis of symmetry .",

    "oppositely the reported results are in total conflict with the standard no - slip prediction @xmath162 ( blue curve ) .",
    "while the present study focussed on the static regime , it is interesting to remark from dimensional analysis that one should expect to observe saturation around @xmath163 @xmath3 m ( i.e. , @xmath164 ) .",
    "the value observed experimentally corresponds to @xmath165 @xmath3 m , which is of the same order of magnitude but nevertheless significantly larger .",
    "the difference could be imputed to geometry considerations , i.e. , to the fact that the dynamics of the fluid around the lever should be strongly influenced by the finite size of the system under study ( indeed , in the regime where the boundary layer @xmath49 plays explicitly a role , retardation should be taken into account ) .",
    "a different explanation could be that the model of perfect slip breaks down at large gap .",
    "a preliminary analysis in that direction shows that if we conserve the inertial term in the navier - stokes equations we indeed obtain a saturation regime due to an additional damping occurring on the length scale @xmath166 and this even if @xmath69 is infinite in the static regime .",
    "fundamentally , the existence of a giant slip length regime is very surprising and interesting and should therefore be discussed carefully . here , we will only review some results which , we think , are important to justify microscopically the results discussed in this article and in ref .",
    "we remind that from a microscopic point of view , the slippage coefficient is actually linked to the very nature of the interaction between the oscillating surface and the air molecules .",
    "historically , the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon goes back to j.  c.  maxwell and to its kinetic theory of gases  @xcite . following this approach one can indeed distinguish between a specular channel of interaction , for which the molecules are colliding elastically with the surface , and a channel of interaction for which",
    "molecules are reflected diffusively from the wall  @xcite .",
    "this second channel is linked to multiple collisions between molecules and also to adsorption by the surface .",
    "the slip length @xmath69 in this statistical model is given by the maxwell formula  @xcite : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the typical mean free path of gas molecules ( i.e. , @xmath169 nm for air in ambient conditions ) and @xmath170 the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient , i.e. , the fraction of those molecules hitting the surface which are reflected diffusively .",
    "clearly , if @xmath170 vanishes then the slip length is infinite .",
    "this suggests that in the working regime of our mechanical oscillator the molecules are mainly reflected specularly .",
    "furthermore , recent analysis based on the fluctuation dissipation theorem and the green - kubo relationship emphasize the importance of several other microscopical parameters on the molecular dynamics close to a surface  @xcite .",
    "altogether these studies provide an estimate for the slip length given by : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the fluid diffusion coefficient , @xmath173 are respectively a typical length and energy characterizing the molecular interaction , and @xmath174 a coefficient measuring the roughness ( larger @xmath174 mean larger roughness ) .",
    "this shows the importance of surface roughness but also of surface defects and nano - structuration  @xcite for the physics of slippage at solid - gas interfaces .",
    "future work should investigate the effects of theses parameters on the damping coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that past studies on the slippage at a solid - fluid interface mainly focussed on liquids for which the mean free path is much smaller ( @xmath175 1 nm ) and for which interactions between molecules are much stronger .",
    "the existence of a partial slip regime implies in those cases to work in the realm of nanofluidics ( e.g. , nanochannels ) with separating gap @xmath2 well below the micrometer range  @xcite or with afms in contact mode  @xcite . here",
    "oppositely , we consider gases and we can define a knudsen coefficient @xmath176 which corresponds to a regime of transition flow @xcite occurring at large gap values @xmath2 ( it is indeed well known that important deviations to the no slip boundary conditions appear for @xmath177  @xcite ) .",
    "+ another relevant length in the analysis is the vibration amplitude of the lever which we reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath178 nm .",
    "this is actually a very small amplitude which is attainable experimentally mainly because of the thermal excitation mode and high sensitivity of the optical detection setup used in @xcite .",
    "this value for @xmath179 is also comparatively smaller that those attainable with actuated afm  @xcite . working in this regime where @xmath180 could therefore lead to new physics and",
    "we expect that further studies in this direction will be done in a close future ( e.g. , to compare the effect of the vibration amplitude and of the excitation modes on the micro- and nano - lever dynamics ) .",
    "+ in this context it is worth mentioning that the theoretical model developed in this article for the plane - plane configuration constitutes the equivalent of the vinogradova formula obtained for the sphere - plane configuration  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of vinogradova generalizes the result obtained by taylor  @xcite in the no slip limit and which predicts a friction force @xmath181 for a sphere of radius r moving along the @xmath7 axis with the velocity @xmath12 perpendicularly to the interface @xmath53 and separated from this plane by a minimal gap @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the no - slip condition predicts the same law @xmath182 as in the plane - plane configuration with the perfect slip condition ( i.e. , eq .",

    "it is worth pointing out however , that in the casimir effect  @xcite the force in the plane - plane configuration varies as @xmath186 whereas it varies as @xmath187 for the sphere - plane configuration ( @xmath188 is the planck constant ) . beside the important difference in the power law behavior in @xmath2 between these expressions and those predicted by hydrodynamics it is interesting to observe that in the perfect slip limit the viscous force decays slowly when @xmath2 increases whereas the same force vanishes in the sphere - plane as predicted by the vinogradova formula for @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , in order to observe the perfect slip regime the plane - sphere configuration would be much more demanding than the plane - plane configuration studied in this work and in @xcite since it implies that one should consider very small gaps @xmath2 to obtain a finite effect with the sphere .",
    "this could have implication in optical near - field microscopy where viscosity is suggested as a possible mechanism to justify the shear force applied on the tip probes  @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for experimental demonstrations in high vacuum at cryogenic temperatures ) .",
    "additionally , this sensitivity of the force behavior with @xmath69 in the sphere - plane configuration could be used to probe more precisely the value of the slippage length than in the plane - plane geometry .",
    "oppositely , the giant slip effect studied in this paper could thus be a specificity of the planar geometry and is expected therefore to have a huge impact on the nems dynamics which are mostly developed with such geometry .",
    "this brings us to the second point that we shall now discuss in this section , that is the implication of our results for nems and mems engineering . owing to the formula given by eq .",

    "@xcite and corresponding to working distances @xmath2 which are decreasing until the overdamped regime at @xmath195 is reached . additionally , we show also the physical characteristics recorded ( i.e. , internal resonance frequency @xmath205 , and fixed distance gap @xmath206 nm with the substrate ) of typical si made nems",
    ". these nems can be with a good approximation described with the simple geometry considered here . clearly , working with such nems in a gaseous environment",
    "may strongly affect their dynamics and only for very high @xmath205 could the overdamping regime actually be overcome .",
    "this is indeed confirmed for those nems annexed by a red cross in fig .",
    "3 which we studied experimentally by using the same optical method as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the experiment showed that nems with such gaps do not resonate in air at room temperature confirming therefore the role played by overdamping .",
    "for the nems indicated by a red circle , _",
    "i.e. _ , with frequency in the 100 khz and mhz range we were out of the detection sensitivity of our setup and no data were available .",

    "again , this fact is confirmed by comparing these graphs with available experimental data ( see fig .  4 and compare with fig .",
    "+ furthermore , it is also useful to remind once again that for a large gap @xmath2 the important length scale is the boundary layer thickness @xmath49 which characterizes the spatial region surrounding the lever for which viscosity has an impact on the fluid dynamics  @xcite . for @xmath208",
    "the substratum lies outside this layer and dissipation must saturate  @xcite , as reported in ref .",
    "comparisons with values for @xmath195 ( see fig .  3 ) show that the overdamping regime is always reached for gaps smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "the overdamping regime appears consequently as a robust limitation which should affect the design of any nems working in fluids .",
    "the results obtained here for a particular lever geometry are expected to be very general as soon as the beam geometrical dimensions are larger than @xmath49 . however , when dimensions are smaller , boundary effects due to the finite size of the system should explicitly be taken into account in the definition of @xmath195 .",
    "in this article we studied the linearized navier - stokes equation in the static regime to describe the damping mechanism of oscillating micro plate in air close to a substrate .",
    "we considered the influence of the slip length and showed that results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are only compatible with very large slip length in the range @xmath209 m .",
    "we discussed the implication of this mechanism on the oscillation properties of nems and showed that an overdamping behavior represents a fundamental mechanism for such systems .",
    "we expect that this work could have important consequences for nems engineering .",
    "this research was partly supported by a `` carnot - nems '' collaborative grant between cea - leti and institut nel .",
    "the aim of this appendix section is to solve the poisson equation @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant for the rectangular domain @xmath210 with boundary conditions @xmath108 along the contour . using a fourier series satisfying these boundary conditions at @xmath211 and @xmath212 we can write @xmath213 here @xmath214 is solution of @xmath215 with @xmath216 if @xmath106 is a odd integer and @xmath217 if @xmath106 is even .",
    "the general solution of this equation is @xmath218 the constant @xmath219 are determined by the boundary conditions @xmath108 at @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",

    "applying the boundary condition @xmath108 along the contour together with the uniqueness theorem implies directly @xmath108 everywhere .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the solutions of the navier - stokes equations @xmath227 @xmath228 are @xmath229 .",
