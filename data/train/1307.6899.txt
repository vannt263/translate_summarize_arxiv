    "as noted in the main text , the analytic corrections to scaling are small , and do not uniformly improve fits away from these special values .",
    "this is not surprising . since the analytic corrections to scaling this close to the critical point are smaller than our interpolation errors in the scaling function , we might expect they would have cancelling effects roughly half the time .",

    "most likely the small distance discrepancy is due to the fact that the form of the scaling solution goes as @xmath225 for small distances , diverging as @xmath226 , however for any data , @xmath227 .",

    "<S> , studies have found that @xmath114  @xcite , and in our data we also see no evidence for a power - law of @xmath109 upon subtracting the exact scaling solutions from the numerical data . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no reason that biomembrane experiments should expect @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is non - zero in ising - like models ( square - lattice klauder and double - gaussian model )  @xcite , with @xmath115    one can also expand the non - universal amplitude @xmath105 , noticing @xmath116 , to get : @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> estimated values of @xmath118 give @xmath119 and so in principle : @xmath120 in the case of ising - like criticality in experiments , where no exact results are known , the combination of the effect of powers of @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 would not be easy to disentangle , requiring a fit to a function that looks like @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> this fit will likely be sloppy  @xcite , with the individual coefficients ill - determined .    </S>",
    "<S> now that we have investigated corrections to scaling at @xmath8 , let us return to our main goal . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function that we provide in this paper is a function of both temperature and field , so we will need to consider analytic corrections in a field . in principle , instead of the scaling form correlation function written in equation  [ eq : scalingcorr ] , the full correlation function should look like : @xmath125 here we incorporate analytic corrections to scaling ( as in eqns  [ eq : correctionst ] ) via the scaling fields @xmath126 and @xmath127 , which are only consistent with the tuning parameters @xmath11 and @xmath128 up to first order . </S>",
    "<S> we may instead write the non - universal amplitudes and scaling fields in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath128 . using the notation of  @xcite they are , @xmath129 by the inversion symmetry of the ising lattice , only terms of @xmath130 are should be allowed . as @xmath128 has the same scaling dimensions as @xmath131 , </S>",
    "<S> the leading analytic corrections should be controlled by temperature up to @xmath132 and we only consider leading order corrections arising from @xmath11 .    for the 2d ising model it is known that @xmath133  @xcite , so we can add all forms of analytic corrections to our scaling function . for the nonlinear scaling fields @xmath126 and @xmath127 , we can translate the effective temperature and field @xmath134 and @xmath135 to effective schofield coordinates , @xmath136 and @xmath137 assuming that since @xmath18 scales with @xmath11 , they will have the same leading order effects , and assuming an arbitrary form for the corrections dependent on @xmath34 . using our parametric definition ( see eq  [ eq : htheta ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we can arrive at closed form expressions for @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( see supplemental material ) , and incorporate @xmath140 and @xmath141 into equation  [ eq : interpolatingc ] . for the amplitude corrections and scaling function corrections , we include them respectively in @xmath142 according to the mccoy / wu expansion . including the analytic corrections in @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 for the constant-@xmath18 data in figure  [ fig : interpolation ] leads to a improvement in the accuracy for the data sets at @xmath145 , @xmath35 , and @xmath22 ( figure  [ fig : analycorrections ] ) , but no systematic improvement for the data sets in between these special points . </S>",
    "<S> this is perhaps unsurprising so near to the critical point , where the analytic corrections are small compared to the residual errors in our scaling form . </S>",
    "<S> overall , including the corrections to scaling , our functional form has an average relative error of @xmath146 per data point .    </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a functional form for the spin - spin correlation function of the 2d ising model at arbitrary temperature and field , which matches known analytical results at @xmath8 , and numerical simulations to high precision . by virtue of the real - space representation , comparing ising predictions to laboratory experiments is reduced to the relatively simple matter of converting experimental parameters ( such as biomembrane temperature and composition ) to the ising variables of temperature and magnetization or magnetic field or , equivalently , @xmath18 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes our functional form a robust tool for testing whether or not real systems fall into the ising universality class .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to thank lorien hayden for help in debugging the ising simulations , alex alemi for recommending the chebyshev polynomials , and michael fisher for informative correspondence . </S>",
