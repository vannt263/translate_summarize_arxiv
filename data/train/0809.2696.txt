    "<S> since many years , theoretical concepts of data mining have been developed and improved . </S>",
    "<S> data mining has become applied to many academic and industrial situations , and recently , soundings of public opinion about privacy have been carried out . however </S>",
    "<S> , a consistent and standardized definition is still missing , and the initial explanation given by @xcite has pragmatically often changed over the years . furthermore , alternative terms like _ knowledge discovery _ have been conjured and forged , and a necessity of a _ data warehouse _ has been endeavoured to persuade the users . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we pick up current definitions and introduce an unified definition that covers existing attempted explanations . for this , we appeal to the natural original of chemical states of aggregation .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of exploration of facts exists since thousands of years , since things like criminal cases or the search for the right medical diagnosis can certainly be interpreted as derivatives : in both cases , numerous facts like evidences or symptoms exist , but the understanding of their interplay and togetherness is initially not obvious . not till then , when a model can be arranged or more precisely , hypothesised , an understanding of the underlying situation becomes likely . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes , external signals support a verification , as for example when the alleged criminal admits the crime or an observation of other patients health care uniquely leads to the solely possibility ; but in almost all situations , a concrete understanding can not be achieved without puzzling .    today , the computer machine has found its way into our daily life . especially in industry and science , </S>",
    "<S> an existence without this machine is no longer conceivable as the automatic processing of _ data _ - which henceforth represents a basic existence - outclasses the human performance in many situations . </S>",
    "<S> however , there exist situations in which human power is still the ne plus ultra , but for situations in which the essential capacity goes beyond the human s grasp , the computer machine is indispensable . in this situation , </S>",
    "<S> the long existing concept of exploring data gathers momentum , having computer machines finally be the catalyst for puzzling . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , industrial and scientific persons of different kind have got aware of these automatic possibilities , especially in research fields like _ statistics _ or _ </S>",
    "<S> machine learning_. formerly , living in a cheerless existence while only concentrating on a low number of data , these representatives have got awaken , understanding future challenges and chances .    with that , the term _ data mining _ has been devised allusion to the digging for gold in digital data mines . this figurative illustration has been chosen to get the idea across to users . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the deducing of _ data mining _ has been done , representing the symbiosis of modern technology and engineering mechanics . nowadays , _ </S>",
    "<S> data mining _ produces lots of interest , many people launch into it , often taking as it is but sometimes also distorting the basic idea , postulating new research fields in conjunction with industrial applications . </S>",
    "<S> one example is _ knowledge discovery _ : to discover knowledge is still not realisable as the complexity of what knowledge is and how we automatically may find it is still out of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the coming machine age does not really motivate something else , but the term is still in use and without exception communicated without reflecting . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the invention of a _ data warehouse _ : </S>",
    "<S> the fiction that an exploration of data is still impossible without having such a data store , has been accepted for many years in industry although a little cogitation would have revealed that this is nothing else than a marketing strategy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it was told that _ data mining _ is so easy to perform , being a children s game , quasi a standard for almost everyone , without that we can not stay any longer . however , the reality looks much more different . </S>",
    "<S> today , the users are confused to such extent , that even the word itself is misspelled , ranging to _ data - mining _ or _ datamining_.    a first definition of _ data mining _ has been introduced by frawley and piatetsky - shapiro @xcite saying that `` data mining is the nontrivial extraction of implicit , previously unknown , and potentially useful information from data '' . since that time , diverse definitions have followed , sometimes slightly deviated , sometimes with the introduction of novel components . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for this pragmatic attendance is the domain where the definitive person is associated with ; this is regarding the occupational association , the speciality , and the volitional interest . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of databases is always accomplished by an accent of the potential of a data warehouse , statisticians surely respond through an importance of mathematical consideration , and research staff from machine learning proclaim data mining as the application of machine learning per se . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of them agree that _ data mining _ is a non - deterministic process , explorative , following a garbage - in and garbage - out paradigm . and the observation from a practical point of view has led to the general belief that different data mining phases exist : firstly , a collection of data , possibly raw , as a response to a previously defined task ( originally , this was nt said , but the complexity had made it inevitable ) , the pre - processing of the data , the data analysis through algorithms from machine learning , partially based on statistical facts and rules , and finally a visualization of the results , matched with an interpretation to understand what has been received . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> commercial and freely available software systems have been created , sometimes praising a _ data mining - suite _ or _ data mining - tool _ , paired with the suggestion that the software completely runs autonomously ( which is , in fact , untrue , since one important feature of data mining is surely the role of the human analyst , being still the definer and decider on almost each levels ) .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from all these histories and the technical side of stringing together data operations , learning algorithms , and visualization techniques , _ data mining _ serves as a much higher impact . </S>",
    "<S> likewise the chemical coherence of gas , fluid , and solid , the importance of _ data mining _ is to transfer a set of data @xmath0 into an other state of aggregation that allows the user to potentially benefit from it . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , _ data mining _ represents a class of digital boosters or catalysts to converse data .    for this </S>",
    "<S> , we call the set of data @xmath0 as the _ first state of aggregation_. whereas data per se simply reflects an increate entity , comparatively an one - dimensional mathematical vector with a value inside , the establishment of information - as a result of techniques described above - proves the existence of something that might be worth or at least interesting . of course </S>",
    "<S> , information might be redundant as well , but the crux is that information has a meaning , and it must therefore be placed to a different state . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> we call the set of information as the _ second state of aggregation _ @xmath1 .    as already mentioned , the discovery or affiliation of information is not always worth , not even for the moment , but obviously or already known . </S>",
    "<S> filtering out this _ noise _ and concentrating on the immaculate set of information means to hold the nuggets in the hand . </S>",
    "<S> these _ insights _ evolve from an understanding of the situation and a conclusive estimation of what is important and what is not . in this respect , the set of _ insights _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 represents the _ third state of aggregation _ </S>",
    "<S> , probably the most interesting one , returning to the first state of aggregation @xmath0 back again . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by exploitation of the _ insights _ , by reacting due to the new situation . </S>",
    "<S> to repress @xmath2 from being exploited simply means to stand still , avoiding the previously defined task to be solved ( figure [ fig : dii1 ] ) .    ) , information ( @xmath1 ) , and insights ( @xmath2).,width=264 ]    but not only a forward but also a backward circulation is available . a return to the second state of aggregation ( @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> can , for example , be obtained by a verificative check of discovered insights ; this possibly lead - as a matter of curiosity or sniffing on novelties - to alternative information , which on his part may be aggregated to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , changing the aggregation state @xmath4 may cause the support of a correction of the data aggregation state itself : maybe , data is false defined , simply wrong or even inconsistent .    </S>",
    "<S> a _ fourth state of aggregation _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is called as the _ knowledge aggregation state_. @xmath5 potentially exists , but corresponds rather to long - term facts that are true in consequence of affirmed observations . whereas other states of aggregation are more short - termed and dynamic in some sense , the _ knowledge state of aggregation _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is stable and modified rather seldom . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath5 occurs continuously , on all states of aggregation .    , </S>",
    "<S> width=264 ]    generally , we have to differ between the _ maintenance _ of an aggregation state and the transfer to another one ( _ circulation _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> for that , the concepts , techniques , and paradigms that have been mentioned above come into play . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a maintenance of data can be achieved by simply managing it through databases , warehouses , or simply data files . </S>",
    "<S> the data is given , potentially structured and finite , and continuously be observed , but unstructured data , data streams , or fluent data belong to it as well . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the same principles apply to all states of aggregation : both information , insights and knowledge may be maintained by these solutions , even be enriched by alternative representation formalisms like images , sound , or videos .    </S>",
    "<S> the transfer , however , is more especial and not really exchangeable . </S>",
    "<S> the transfer of @xmath6 is a tedious process , including the data preparation , the non - deterministic usage of statistical and machine learning algorithms , and data visualization as well . with that </S>",
    "<S> , information can be extracted , evaluated , and filtered . </S>",
    "<S> the transfer @xmath7 is solely be done by a ( human ) interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , receiving thousands of association rules may imply thousands of inspections and revisions . </S>",
    "<S> the final transfer @xmath8 is the conclusion of an aware application .    </S>",
    "<S> a final important aspect is - in our understanding - the differentiation between the third and the fourth state of aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is due to the time , meaning that @xmath2 corresponds more to a short - termed novelty that is true for the data moment . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 , however , is independent from the time per se , representing a fact that has been proven again and again .    </S>",
    "<S> [ def ] following the ideas above , our understanding of _ data mining _ is solely concerned with the declaration of states of aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> this concerns both the management and the transfer as well , aiming at gaining purely insights ( and nothing else , but only if existing ) : insights stands on his part for novelty through exploration . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by verification , which leads to an authentication but not to novelty . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> our understanding of data mining is the following :    * data mining is the maintenance of and circulation in different states of aggregation to finally gain insights .    </S>",
    "<S> the maintenance concerns both @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> as already mentioned , the set of data @xmath0 can be managed by databases , data warehouse , images , audio files , and videos . </S>",
    "<S> the sets of information @xmath1 , insights @xmath2 , and knowledge @xmath5 are managed by clusters , decision trees , neural networks , a set of association rules , visualizations , statistical values , prediction rules , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the circulation is bidirectional and reflexive , meaning that a circulation does not necessarily cause a change of states of aggregation . with this , the circulation includes topics like data pre - processing like discretisation , sampling , factor analysis and principal component analysis , etc . , and machine learning algorithms like decision trees , clustering , association discovery , etc .        note that @xmath9 because @xmath2 simply represents the filtered information that is worth and novel . on the other side , @xmath10 , having an arbitrary natural number @xmath11 , where the set of information is a subset of the combination of data of arbitrary size . in concern of the dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of data elements is not necessarily bigger than the information value . however , @xmath12 and @xmath13 because of the filtering again .    </S>",
    "<S> we try to map three given definitions exemplarily and therewith prove that the definition given above bears up against this attribution . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> we firstly select a definition given by @xcite , then a definition by @xcite , and finally a definition by @xcite . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> data mining is explained as _ the non - trivial process of identifying valid , novel , potentially useful , and ultimately understandable patterns in data _ </S>",
    "<S> , @xcite proposes that data mining _ is referenced to the process of sorting through large amounts of data and picking out relevant information _ and @xcite argues that data mining _ is the process of finding new and potentially useful knowledge from data . or more simpler : data mining is the art and science of finding interesting and useful patterns in data . _    </S>",
    "<S> for the first definition , the _ non - trivial process _ certainly reflects the circulation between at least two states of aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> the demand of finding patterns of a certain characteristic is ensured as that the third state of aggregation guarantees - through the involvement of the human user - exactly such insights . </S>",
    "<S> sorting through large amounts of data , as mentioned in the second definition , refers to the circulation @xmath6 and possibly to @xmath14 as well ( picking up ) , although the terminology ( information @xmath15 insights ) is not congruent . for the third definition , </S>",
    "<S> the argument of having a _ process _ is again the circulation itself whereas the term _ knowledge _ corresponds to our conception of having _ insights _ before _ knowledge_. the _ art and science of _ lies in the hands of the human user , which is also given here .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath0 the set of data , @xmath1 the set of information , and @xmath2 the set of insights , and assume that the following simple data situation is given with a number of web users and a number of web pages being visited . </S>",
    "<S> assume furthermore that only web page names are stored , but not the suffix _ </S>",
    "<S> .html_. the task is to analyse the users web behavior , possibly leading to a re - organisation of the existing web portal structure . for that </S>",
    "<S> , the standard association discovery ( apriori ) ( @xcite ) is applied , setting initially the threshold parameters to _ support=2 _ and _ </S>",
    "<S> confidence=2_.    .... d = { user 1 : home , baby , drinks , wclothes user 2 : music , cclothes , wclothes ,           cclothes , drinks , wclothes user 3 : baby , drinks , baby , info , home   user 4 : drinks , home , fashion , wclothes   user 5 : baby , drinks , wclothes , fashion ,           cclothes , wclothes user 6 : home , info , wclothes , cclothes ,           fashion , wclothes   ... } ....    the data situation corresponds to the first state of aggregation that follows an reflexive aggregation procedure of extracting the web page names out of the log - file , the fixation of the threshold parameters and the structuring of the data per se . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , this can be extended to the establishment of a hierarchy , for example that clothes for women ( wclothes ) , men ( mclothes ) , and children ( cclothes ) belong to the superior class _ </S>",
    "<S> clothes_.    the first state of aggregation becomes abandoned when calculating a set of association rules , defining the second state of aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , several other information can be gained by observation , for example that _ wclothes _ is often used as exit or that _ home _ is rather a rare entrance page . </S>",
    "<S> the information aggregation state therefore is    .... f = { ... fashion = = > wclothes baby = = > drinks ... wclothes : exit page in 80% of cases   home : entrance page in 33% of cases . } ....    with @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the association rules are accomplished by statistical values to ease the interpretation ; at this moment , the second state of aggregation changes to the third state of aggregation ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the change to the insights state of aggregation is done by interpretation : whereas _ fashion _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 _ wclothes _ is obvious and filtered out , only the fact concerning _ baby _ and _ drinks _ as well as the _ exit _ story , respectively , is taken :    .... i = { baby = = > drinks wclothes is often used as exit   } ....    with that , and as a consequence of @xmath8 , the web page system may be restructured , offering a separate link on each _ baby _ web - page to _ drinks_. in the future , this slightly change will influence the data state of aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the fact that a visit of _ baby.html _ triggers a visit of _ drinks.html _ certainly may invite to verify whether other beverages are also concerned or not . </S>",
    "<S> the worth of the _ baby , drinks _ correlation may likewise incite to additionally consider hierarchies or ontologies . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there are many reasons to branch backward to states of aggregation .    to get back to the differentiation between the third and fourth state of aggregation : the fact that a correlation between _ baby _ and _ drinks _ exists is certainly to be put on the insight state of aggregation but not necessarily on the knowledge state of aggregation . however , if it becomes certified that - for example - unconcerned sets of data show a similar insight or that _ </S>",
    "<S> _ baby__@xmath17_drinks _ is present in similar web systems as well , then this insight is definitely circulated to @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have defined the term _ data mining _ consciously as it has been introduced in section [ def ] , and with this , it consequently affects long - established research fields like database systems , statistics , and artificial intelligence . in this respect , the definition , however , could be too comprehensive to someone s position and/or probably overdraw a general accordance and acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> this is intelligible but everyone should be clear in his mind that a discussion about _ data mining _ is per se not of small value and that a consideration of influencing techniques must be considered . as an example , the field of _ artificial intelligence _ also uses , among other disciplines , logic , linguistic ideas , or programming languages : it is therefore not superior but simply understands these research fields as legitimate additives .    to reconcile existing derivatives of _ data mining _ and to discover a definition for it is necessary and a matter of course . </S>",
    "<S> the current situation in the field of computer science and its interdisciplinary fields do not follow this demand but pragmatically take absorb existing explanations or devise novel topics in it . </S>",
    "<S> this work surely contributes to this as well , but tries to constructively propose a uniform prospect of _ data mining_. following our experiences in industry and academics , we believe that the proposed model of states of aggregation in conjunction with the maintenance and circulation process is a reliable , confident and constructive model . </S>"
