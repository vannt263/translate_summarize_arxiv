    "the gauge / gravity duality is a powerful method of studying strongly coupled phenomena using dual weakly coupled gravitational systems @xcite .",
    "this duality which can be considered as one of the most successful applications of string theory .",
    "one of the interesting applications is on condensed matter systems ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in trying to understand condensed matter phenomena , e.g. ,",
    "superconductivity , using the gauge / gravity duality , two main approaches have been followed .",
    "one is a more phenomenological approach ( termed _ bottom - up _ approach ) , in which terms in the action are postulated and their effects studied , postponing the derivation of such terms and their relative strength from a full quantum theory to the future . in the other approach ( termed _ top - down _ approach ) , one starts with the full quantum theory ( string / m theory ) and uses it to derive all terms in the action .",
    "although the latter is a more rigorous approach , the range of applications is limited . in our view , progress needs to be made in both directions .    in the bottom - up approach ,",
    "the simplest holographic superconductor model is described by an einstein - maxwell - scalar field theory with a negative cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the gravity dual of the holographic superconductor is an abelian - higgs model with a stationary black hole metric in which the scalar field condenses below a certain critical temperature .",
    "the mechanism of instability has a geometric origin @xcite .",
    "if the charge of the scalar field is large enough , then the effective mass of the scalar field @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential , can drop below the breitenlohner - freedman bound near the horizon of the black hole signaling the breaking of an abelian gauge symmetry outside the black hole horizon .",
    "since the space is asymptotically ads , the scalar field is trapped outside the black hole horizon resulting in the formation of a condensate which destabilizes the configuration , and a hairy black hole forms below the critical temperature ( for a review , see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this phenomenological approach has the virtue of simplicity , but does not capture all the underlying features of the gauge / gravity duality including quantum effects .",
    "this is hard to implement , as it remains a challenge to embed this model in a quantum system ( string / m - theory ) . in the top - down approach ,",
    "one aims at finding exact solutions of @xmath7 and type iib supergravity .",
    "the latter approach is mainly based on kaluza - klein truncations of supergravity theories .",
    "fully back reacted solutions of @xmath7 supergravity describing holographic superconductors in three spacetime dimensions have been found @xcite .",
    "these models , which are consistent truncations of string / m theories reduced to four spacetime dimensions , contain a large number of scalar , gauge fields and high derivatives of them , which need to be constrained in order to make the models tractable @xcite .",
    "interesting physics arises when an external magnetic field is applied to a superconductor .",
    "as the temperature is lowered and the external magnetic field becomes stronger , the superconductors expel the magnetic field .",
    "this is the well - known meissner effect .",
    "depending on their behavior in the presence of an external magnetic field , ordinary superconductors are classified into two categories , namely type i and type ii . in type",
    "i superconductors , for fields stronger than a critical value ( @xmath8 ) , a first - order transition occurs from the superconducting phase to the normal phase . on the other hand , in type ii superconductors ,",
    "a gradual second - order phase transition occurs , and the material ceases to be a superconductor for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the upper critical field strength .",
    "holographic superconductors in the presence of external magnetic field have been discussed in the bottom - up approach @xcite .",
    "it was found that for a non - zero external magnetic field in two spatial dimensions , it is inconsistent to have non - trivial spatially independent solutions on the boundary .",
    "two classes of localized solutions were found , the droplet @xcite , and vortex solutions with integer winding number @xcite .    in the top - down approach ,",
    "the effects of an external magnetic field were discussed in @xcite .",
    "a model was proposed @xcite which had an explicit field theory realization as strongly coupled @xmath11 super yang - mills theory with flavor .",
    "using gauge / gravity duality , with the probe of two flavor d7branes in the ads black hole background , it was shown that the system underwent a second - order phase transition to a new state which was a p - wave superconductor because of the presence of flavor symmetry . subsequently in @xcite , the meissner effect was studied by introducing an external magnetic field .",
    "in all the above approaches , the effects of an external magnetic field on the holographic superconductor were considered within the standard maxwell electrodynamics and coupling to charges .",
    "there are various reasons to consider higher - derivative terms as corrections to the usual maxwell field couplings .",
    "first of all these couplings appear in a consistent truncation of string / m theories .",
    "secondly , using the usual maxwell theory it is widely believed that holographic superconductors are of type ii rather than type i. it would be interesting to see if these terms affect the behavior of holographic superconductor under the influence of an external magnetic field . in this direction",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , by introducing higher - derivative corrections to the usual maxwell action , it was found that the value of the critical field strength @xmath12 was affected , indicating that the presence of these terms may alter the nature of the phase transition from the superconducting to the normal state .",
    "further work is needed to understand whether these terms can give a first - order transition .    our main motivation to consider higher - order terms comes from the recent progress in high-@xmath13 superconductors .",
    "it was found that , when a strong external magnetic field coupled to the spins of the conduction electrons is applied to a superconductor , inhomogeneous phases appear as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this results in a separation of the fermi surfaces corresponding to electrons with opposite spins ( for a review see @xcite ) , and the electron pairing is destroyed , resulting in a first - order transition from the superconducting state to the normal state .",
    "as has been shown by fulde and ferrell @xcite , and larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite , a new state ( the fflo state ) can form with a modulated order parameter in a weakly coupled bcs system .    a way to understand",
    "the formation of these inhomogeneous states in a strongly coupled system is to generalize the potential of holographic superconductors by including terms containing higher - derivative couplings of the scalar field to the gauge potential .",
    "such terms should arise from quantum corrections in a top - down approach . in the bottom - up approach followed here ,",
    "we are led to consider the effective potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the field strength of a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a charged complex scalar field of mass @xmath18 and charge @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we limit ourselves to the case in which all couplings , except @xmath1 , are set to zero ( @xmath21 ) , leaving a more complete discussion to future work .",
    "we study the effects of allowing the gauge field to develop both an electric and a magnetic component . in the absence of the higher - order interaction ( @xmath22 )",
    ", we reproduce the droplet solution discussed in @xcite . in the case of non - vanishing coupling constant @xmath1",
    ", we find that , as the magnetic field becomes stronger , the droplet solution becomes more inhomogeneous .",
    "moreover , as the temperature is lowered , there is a critical value @xmath12 of the magnetic field above which the critical temperature is higher than in a system with @xmath22 .    in the case of weak magnetic field , and with @xmath22 , we reproduce the results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "if we switch on the higher - derivative coupling , we find that the system undergoes a phase transition at a higher critical temperature .",
    "this gives an interesting and unexpected result : as the strength of the higher - derivative interaction increases , the gap becomes smaller .",
    "we find a gap @xmath23 compared to @xmath24 when @xmath22 .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in this problem . in @xcite ,",
    "a periodic potential was introduced , and a value of @xmath25 was found , which is closer to the experimental value . it would be interesting to see if we can attain this value in our model as well , by tuning the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] , we present the details of the model . in section [ sec:3 ] , we consider droplet solutions , and calculate the critical temperature with the electromagnetic field having both electric and magnetic components . in section [ sec:4 ] , we go below the critical temperature assuming that the magnetic field is weak and calculate the energy gap in the probe limit . finally in section [ sec:5 ] , we discuss our conclusions .",

    "[ fig - tb ] in the low magnetic field regime .",
    "we observe that , unlike strong magnetic fields , the critical temperature is larger if the higher - derivative coupling is stronger .",

    "there is a transition region marked in the inserted box in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig - tb ] , which we enlarge in fig .",

    "we find that the cross point between lines of @xmath83 and @xmath3 occurs at @xmath84 .",
    "below this value of the magnetic field , the critical temperature is smaller for negative coupling @xmath1 . above this value ,",

    "the transitional strength of the magnetic field between @xmath85 and the minimal coupling is at @xmath87 , above which the critical temperature for minimal coupling becomes higher .",
    "one of the reasons of introducing the generalized potential term was to account for the fflo states .",
    "these states appear in high - field superconductors when a strong magnetic field is applied , as fulde and ferrell @xcite and larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite showed independently .",
    "their main feature is exhibiting an order parameter which is not a constant , but has a space variation .",
    "unfortunately , we can not compare the transition temperature of our inhomogeneous solution to that of a homogeneous solution , because the latter does not exist in our system .",
    "we will comment further on this point in section [ sec:5 ] .    in the above calculations , we have considered an exact solution of the field equations ( dyonic black hole ) , which includes the back - reaction of the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , our results for the critical temperature are exact in the entire parameter space depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - tb ] .",
    "as we lower the temperature below the critical temperature , the field equations become considerably more involved .",
    "we shall concentrate on the case of a weak magnetic field where the backreaction on the metric can be safely ignored . in this regime ,",
    "the critical temperature is finite and there is a region below @xmath13 which is well above zero temperature so that the no - backreaction approximation remains valid . in the strong magnetic field limit ,",
    "there is no region below @xmath13 where the backreaction can be ignored , because the critical temperature is already close to zero .",
    "in this section we perform calculations below the critical temperature .",
    "we concentrate on the weak magnetic field limit . to simplify the calculations",

    "this implies that in the boundary field theory , which is dual to the gravitational theory , with stronger higher - derivative coupling between the @xmath0 gauge field and the scalar field , the gauge symmetry can be broken more easily .",
    ".the critical temperature for scaling dimension @xmath75 and various values of the coupling @xmath81 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we set up a gravitational dual of a holographic superconductor which included a higher - derivative coupling of strength @xmath1 .",
    "our system had standard composition , consisting of a @xmath0 gauge field , and a complex scalar field coupled to gravity .",
    "the novel feature was a higher - derivative coupling between the @xmath0 gauge field and the scalar field .",
    "we solved the field equations and compared the results with the conventional case of a holographic superconductor ( @xmath3 ) . in the limit in which the magnetic field is weak , we found a spatially independent ( homogeneous ) solution . in the case",
    "in which the coupling strength @xmath81 of the higher - derivative coupling vanishes , we recovered the results of @xcite .",
    "as the strength of the coupling increases , the gravitational mechanism of breaking an abelian @xmath0 symmetry outside the horizon of a black hole @xcite becomes more effective , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - meff1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - meff2 ] . calculating the critical temperature ,",
    "both analytically and numerically , we found that as the strength of the interaction increased , there was an enhancement of the critical temperature ( tables [ g1-temp1 ] and [ g1-temp2 ] ) at which the scalar condensate formed .    in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the normal state corresponds to the background of a dyonic black hole .",
    "the field equations possess spatially dependent ( inhomogeneous ) solutions .",
    "we found that the presence of the higher - derivative coupling did not affect the @xmath64-dependent profile of the scalar field solution .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath64-dependent profile of the scalar field is given by the solution of equation ( [ psi2b ] ) which depends on the strength of the magnetic field . as it is discussed in @xcite ,",
    "when the magnetic field is zero , the @xmath64-dependence of the condensate disappears and we recover the homogeneous solution .",
    "however , as the magnetic field is increased , the @xmath64-dependent profile of the scalar field acquires a  thickness \" making the condensate more inhomogeneous .",
    "the presence of the higher - derivative coupling term influences the radial dependence of the scalar field contributing to the critical temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig - tb ] , the @xmath34 phase diagram for various values of the coupling @xmath81 is shown .",
    "we can see some interesting features of our droplet solutions in the low temperature , strong magnetic field region of the phase diagram ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - tb ] ) . for @xmath2 and a fixed value of the magnetic field",
    "we can probe lower temperatures .",
    "for @xmath4 the condensate forms at a higher critical temperature and at a stronger magnetic field making the corresponding droplet solution more inhomogeneous .",
    "as we discussed , this behavior is reminiscent of the formation of fflo states , in the case where inhomogeneous states at low temperature are energetically more favorable .    to have a better understanding of our droplet solutions in the @xmath123 limit and their possible connection with the inhomogeneous fflo states",
    ", we have to improve our numerical techniques in order to probe larger ( positive and negative ) values of the coupling constant @xmath81 .",
    "we could also look for solutions with a strong magnetic field penetrating the whole @xmath42-plane and study the behavior of the system by solving the full non - linear system of the coupled einstein - maxwell - scalar equations .",
    "besides the higher - derivative coupling considered in this work , it is also of interest to generalize the study on the influence of other higher - derivative terms in the holographic superconductor , especially in the presence of the external magnetic field .",
    "another interesting problem is to extend this analysis to other types of holographic superconductors which have more structure , e.g. , the p - wave superconductor .",
    "the motivation is two - fold .",
    "firstly , it would be interesting to see if the effect we found in the s - wave superconductor , namely that the value of the gap is reduced as the strength of the derivative coupling increases , persists in the case of the richer structure of a p - wave superconductor .",
    "secondly , one can study how the presence of the higher derivative terms affects the behavior of a p - wave superconductor as the strength of the magnetic field increases and the temperature is lowered .",
    "we have to note however , that even in the s - wave superconductor , the inclusion of the higher - derivative term brings technical difficulties so one should expect an increase in the complexity in the case of p - wave superconductor .",
