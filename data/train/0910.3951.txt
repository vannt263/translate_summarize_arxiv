    "4u 2129 + 47 was discovered to be one of the accretion disk corona ( adc ) sources @xcite , which are believed to be near edge - on accreting systems since they have shown binary orbital modulation via broad , partial v - shape x - ray eclipses ( @xcite , hereafter mc82 , @xcite ) ; the eclipse width was @xmath3 in phase and @xmath4 of the x - rays were occulted at the eclipse midpoint .",
    "the origins of adcs are not fully understood , but they are typically associated with high accretion - rate systems , wherein we are only observing the small fraction of the system luminosity that is scattered into our line of sight . for the prototypical adc x1822@xmath5371 , models suggest that it is accreting at a near eddington rate , with the radiation scattered into our line of sight having an equivalent isotropic luminosity on the order of 1% of the total luminosity ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .    in the early 1980s ,",
    "observations of 4u 2129 + 47 showed that both its x - ray and optical lightcurves were modulated over a @xmath6  h period @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a type - i x - ray burst led to the classification of 4u 2129 + 47 as a neutron star ( ns ) low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) system @xcite , and the companion was suggested to be a late k or m spectral type star of @xmath7 .",
    "the source distance was estimated to be @xmath82kpc @xcite .",
    "assuming isotropic emission , the x - ray luminosity would have then corresponded to @xmath9  ergs@xmath10 .",
    "even if the luminosity were 100 times larger , the luminosity would have been somewhat smaller than expected for an adc .",
    "since 1983 , 4u 2129 + 47 has been in a quiescent state .",
    "optical observations show a flat lightcurve without any evidence for orbital modulation between the years 1983 and 1987 . additionally , instead of an expected m- or k - type companion , the observed spectrum was compatible with a late type f8 iv star @xcite .",
    "the refined x - ray source position as determined by _",
    "chandra _ turned out to be coincident with the f star to within @xmath11 ( @xcite , hereafter n02 ) .",
    "the probability of a chance superposition is less than @xmath12 ( see also @xcite ) , therefore , the hypothesis of a foreground star is unlikely .",
    "a @xmath13 km  s@xmath10 shift in the mean radial velocity was derived from the f star spectrum , providing evidence for a dynamical interaction between the f star and 4u 2129 + 47 @xcite .",
    "the system was therefore suggested to be a hierarchical triple system , in which the f star is in a month - long orbit around the binary @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is tentatively confirmed with two _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations separated by 22 days that showed deviations from a simple orbital ephemeris ( @xcite , hereafter b07 ) . assuming that the f star is part of the system , the source distance was revised to @xmath14  kpc @xcite .",
    "this would imply that the peak luminosity observed prior to 1983 ( assuming that the observed flux was @xmath15% of the average flux ) was a substantial fraction of the eddington luminosity .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 4u 2129 + 47 , as determined with a _",
    "chandra _ observation taken in 2000 , was consistent with thermal emission plus a powerlaw hard tail ( n02 ) .",
    "the 28kev flux was @xmath16 of the 0.52kev absorbed flux .",
    "the contribution of the `` powerlaw '' hard tail to the 0.52kev band was , of course , model dependent , but was consistent with being @xmath17 of the 0.52kev flux , as we discuss below .",
    "a sinusoidal orbital modulation ( peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath18 ) was observed in the x - ray lightcurve in the same observation .",
    "the phase resolved spectra showed variation in the hydrogen column density .",
    "however , in the _ xmm - newton _ observations ( b07 ) , the sinusoidal modulation was absent , while the flux of the powerlaw component was constrained to be less than @xmath19 of the @xmath20 kev flux ( b07 ) .",
    "here we report on recent _ xmm - newton _ observations of 4u  2129 + 47 .",
    "we combine analyses of these observations with reanalyses of the previous observations , and show that , absent the two 2005 _ xmm - newton _ observations ( b07 ) , the historical observations are consistent with a linear ephemeris with a constant period .",
    "we outline our data reduction procedure in  2 and present the timing and spectral analysis in  3 and  4 respectively .",

    "the total time span for each of these 4 observations was 43270sec , resulting in effective exposure times of at least 30ksec for the epic - pn , epic - mos1 , and epic - mos2 cameras for the first three observations .",
    "the remaining observing time was discarded due to the background flares . the standard _",
    "xmm newton _ science analysis system ( sas 8.0 ) was used to process the observation data files ( odfs ) and to produce calibrated event lists .",
    "we used the emproc task for the two epic - mos cameras and used the epproc task for the epic - pn camera .",
    "we used the high energy ( e @xmath21kev ) lightcurves to determine the good time intervals , so as to obtain the event lists that were not affected by background flares .",
    "the good time intervals are slightly different for epic - pn and epic - mos cameras ; therefore , the overlap good time interval was used to filter each lightcurve with the evselect keywords  timemin \" and  timemax \" .    the low energy ( @xmath22kev ) source lightcurves and the spectra ( @xmath23kev ) were extracted within the circles of @xmath24 radius centered on the source .",
    "larger circles were not used in order to avoid a digital sky survey stellar object ( labeled as s@xmath25 in n02 ) .",
    "we extracted background lightcurves and spectra within the same ccd as the source region .",
    "the largest source - free regions near the source , which were within circles of radii about @xmath26 , were chosen for background extraction .",
    "the sas backscale task was performed to calculate the difference in extraction areas between source and background . in order to obtain the mid - eclipse epochs , we tried various bin sizes ( @xmath27  s , @xmath28  s and @xmath29  s etc . ) to obtain the best compromise between signal to noise ratio in a bin , and time resolution .",
    "finally the lightcurves were extracted with the bin size of @xmath28s .",
    "the times of all lightcurves were corrected to the barycenter of the solar system by using the sas barycen task .",
    "lightcurves from epic - pn and two epic - mos cameras were summed up with the lcmath task , in order to get better statistics in the fitting of the eclipse parameters . given the low count rate of the epic - mos cameras compared to the epic - pn camera , for the spectral analysis",
    "we discuss only the spectrum from the epic - pn camera .",
    "the observation made on jan 18 , 2008 was seriously affected by background flares , however , 2 eclipses were found in each of the other 3 observations respectively , resulting in 6 eclipses for fitting .",
    "the 3 pairs of eclipses were then simultaneously fit with the same set of eclipse parameters .",
    "the ingress duration , the egress duration , and the duration of the eclipse ( defined to be from the beginning of the ingress to the end of the egress ) were set to be free parameters and assumed to be the same for all 6 eclipses , under the hypothesis that these eclipses should have the same shape ( see  5 ) .",
    "the starting time of the first eclipse ingress and the count rates within and out of the eclipse were fit for each lightcurve individually .",
    "the separation between the two connected eclipses within the same lightcurve was set to be 18857.63s based upon the previous _ chandra _ results .",
    "the second eclipse in each lightcurve therefore only contributed to the fitting of the eclipse shapes , while only the first eclipse in each lightcurve has been used to estimate the orbital ephemeris .",
    "the mid - eclipse epoch was defined to be the starting time of the ingress plus half of the eclipse full ingress - to - egress duration .",
    "the model was integrated over each time bin , especially the bins that are crossed by the ingress and the egress , in order to be compatible with either the finite ingress / egress durations or the infinite ingress / egress slopes ( for a rectangular eclipse model ) .",

    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spectra of the 3 observations were accumulated during the same time intervals selected for the extraction of the epic - pn lightcurves , except that the eclipses were also excluded .",
    "spectral analysis was carried out using isis version 1.4.9 - 55 @xcite . since there is no evidence of orbital modulation in the lightcurves ,",
    "the spectra we produced were not phase resolved . furthermore , preliminary fits indicated little or no variability among spectra from individual observations ; therefore , we fit all spectra simultaneously . specifically , we used the isis combine_datasets functionality to sum the spectra and responses during analysis .",
    "the data were binned to have a minimum signal - to - noise of 4.5 and a minimum of four energy channels per grouped spectral bin .",
    "the spectra were fit over an energy range such that the lower bounds of the spectral bins exceeded 0.3kev , and the upper bounds of the spectral bins were less than 8kev .",
    "( this latter criteria , with the above grouping , effectively restricted the upper bound of the spectra to be @xmath56kev . )",

    "this 0.52kev flux is 36% lower than the @xmath69 found during the peaks of the _ chandra _ lightcurve ( see below ) .",
    "note that above , and throughout this work , unless stated otherwise we will quote 68% confidence limits for fluxes , but 90% confidence limits for fit parameters .    to estimate the 26kev flux , we grouped the spectrum ( starting at 2kev ) to have a minimum signal - to - noise of 3 and a minimum of 2 channels per grouped energy bin , and then we fit an unabsorbed powerlaw spectrum between 26kev . ( grouping to higher",
    "signal - to - noise left no channels between @xmath706kev . )",
    "this yields an estimated @xmath71 in the 26kev band , which is to be compared to the nearly five times larger 26kev flux of @xmath72 from the _ chandra _ observations ( see below ) .",
    "the question then arises as to when the drop in the 0.52kev flux occurred , and whether or not it is solely attributable to the loss of the hard x - ray tail . to further explore these issues ,",

    "the powerlaw normalization was consistent with 0 , and thus excluded a powerlaw from the fits to these data .",

    "we find @xmath77 , @xmath78kev , and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 degrees of freedom .",
    "note that the larger @xmath66 value found here compared to n02 is due to the inclusion of the 0.30.5kev data , and is partly indicative of a systematic dependence of this parameter upon the index of the fitted powerlaw .",
    "for the best - fit powerlaw index , @xmath81 of the 0.52kev absorbed flux is attributable to the powerlaw .",
    "this is not enough to account for the drop in flux between the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "however , if for the _ chandra _ spectra we fix the powerlaw at its 90% confidence level upper limit ( @xmath82 ) , then @xmath83 of the 0.52kev absorbed flux is attributable to the powerlaw component ( albeit with an @xmath84 , which is higher than the best fit values for the _ xmm - newton _ data ) .",
    "this is more than enough to account for all of the change in the 0.52kev absorbed flux , and highlights some of the systematic uncertainties inherent in determining bolometric flux changes ( i.e. , the need to adequately model the changes in the local column and to use realistic models for the hard x - ray tail ) . with these current data , it is difficult to distinguish between resumed cooling of the neutron star thermal component , or mere loss of the additional ( presumed external ) hard tail component that here is modeled with a powerlaw .    to highlight some of the issues with determining bolometric flux changes and with attributing any changes to specific model components , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we show error contours for the _ unabsorbed _ 0.510kev flux in the blackbody and powerlaw components when fitting the 2007/2008 _ xmm - newton _ spectra and the _ chandra _ spectra .",
    "these errors account for uncertainties in the neutral column , but do not address systematic issues with the choice of model itself .",
    "we see that formally the 99% confidence level contours _ do not overlap _ , which would indicate that _ both _ the thermal and powerlaw components have decreased between the time of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "however , if we ignore the first bin ( 0.30.6kev ) in the _ chandra _ spectra , the _ chandra _ contours shift significantly leftward towards lower blackbody flux .",
    "( additionally , the fitted neutral column also decreases .",
    ") there is less of a shift downward in powerlaw flux between these two fits of the _",
    "chandra data_. thus , as stated above , it remains somewhat ambiguous as to what extent the changes between the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data can be attributed solely to components other than the thermal emission from the neutron star .",
    "we have fit also the _ xmm - newton _ spectra with the neutron star atmosphere ( nsa ) model of @xcite , by fixing the neutron star distance to @xmath85kpc and the neutron star mass to 1.4@xmath86",
    ". results of these fits are presented in table  [ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "they are consistent with those of n02 and b07 ( although n02 also required the inclusion of a powerlaw component ) .",
    "specifically , we find neutron star radii of @xmath87 km , and effective temperatures in the range of 23@xmath88k .",
    "if we instead use the nsatmos model of @xcite , again fixing the neutron star mass and distance as above , we find lower neutron star temperatures ( @xmath89k ) and significantly larger radii ( @xmath90 km ) .",
    "this raises the question of the degree to which one can find a consistent fitted mass and radius among all the datasets discussed here .    to explore this question ,",
    "we have performed a joint fit of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "the observations from the individual observing epochs ( 2000 , 2005 , 2007/2008 ) were grouped and added as described above , with the additional caveat that we now exclude the _ chandra _ data below 0.6kev so as to minimize the influence of the soft - end of the powerlaw component on the fitted neutral column .",
    "we include a hard tail , modeled as a @xmath57 powerlaw , in fits to the _ chandra _ spectra , and again use the nsatmos model @xcite to describe the soft spectra from all epochs .",
    "for this latter component we again fix the distance to 6.3kpc and we further constrain the neutron star mass and radius to be the same for all epochs .",
    "the individual epochs , however , are fitted with independent neutron star temperatures and neutral columns .",
    "results are presented in table  [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "we find that one can find a set of consistent parameters that are statistically acceptable .",
    "there is a modest need for the _ chandra _ spectra to be described with a slightly larger neutral column than that fit to the 2007/2008 _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "spectra also require a slightly higher neutron star temperature , but here all temperatures fall within each others error bars .",
    "the best fit mass is 1.66@xmath91 and the best fit radius is 5.55 km .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the values presented in table  [ tab : tab2 ] when applying the nsatmos model with a fixed mass of 1.4@xmath91 , and is more consistent with the values found when using the nsa model .",
    "the reasons for this can be elucidated by examining the error contours for the fitted mass and radius . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we show the mass / radius contours obtained from applying an absorbed nsatmos model to just the 2007/2008 _ xmm - newton _ data ( i.e. , our best measured spectrum , with no discernible hard tail ) .",
    "we see that the error contours admit a wide range of masses and radii , with the curvature of these contours generally favoring two regimes : small radius ( with high temperature - not shown in this figure ) and large radius ( with lower temperture ) . formally , the small radius / high temperature solution is the statistical minimum ; however , it is not statistically very different than the large radius / low temperature regime .",
    "( comparable contours for the nsa model look very similar , albeit with the contours shifted to lower mass values . )",
    "these different fit parameter regimes add further systematic uncertainty to estimates of the unabsorbed , 0.5 - 10kev flux .",
    "as shown in tables  [ tab : tab2 ] and [ tab : tab3 ] , the estimate of this flux ranges from 1.51.9@xmath92 for the 2007/2008 _ xmm - newton _ data alone .",
    "furthermore , we see that depending upon whether we use a phenomenological model ( the blackbody plus powerlaw fits ) individually fit to each epoch , or a more physical model ( e.g. , nsatmos ) jointly fit to all epochs , we either find evidence for further neutron star cooling or evidence of a consistent neutron star surface temperature .",
    "we again caution , however , that determining the bolometric flux in specific model components can be fraught with many systematic uncertainties ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) , and we therefore consider any evidence for further neutron star cooling to be ambiguous at best .",
    "we reported on recent _ xmm - newton _ observations of 4u 2129 + 47 in a quiescent state . given lower background flaring rates and relatively longer durations of these observations compared to the 2005 _ xmm - newton _ observations reported by @xcite , we were able to make clear the following three points :    1 .",
    "the 0.52kev absorbed x - ray flux of the source has been reduced by more than @xmath16 compared to the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "this was even true for the observations discussed by b07 .",
    "the sinusoidal variation seen in the _ chandra _ observation ( @xmath18 peak - to - peak ) is absent , or at least greatly diminished ( @xmath38 confidence level upper limits of @xmath93 modulation ) .",
    "additionally , the associated neutral column exhibits no orbital variability , and is consistent with the brightest / least absorbed orbital phases of the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "3 .   the powerlaw tail seen in the _ chandra _",
    "observation is absent .",
    "a @xmath57 powerlaw contributes less than @xmath19 of the 0.52kev flux , and is not evident in the @xmath94  kev band .",
    "the 26kev flux is reduced by a factor of five compared to the _ chandra _ observation .    with this further drop in the x - ray flux of the source",
    ", we may now truly be seeing 4u  2129 + 47 enter into a quiescent stage solely dominated by neutron star cooling , with little or no contribution from residual weak accretion .",
    "the spectrum of the source can be well explained by absorbed blackbody emission from the surface of a neutron star , with an emission radius of @xmath95  km .",
    "likewise , more sophisticated neutron star atmosphere models also describe the spectra very well , with no need for an additional component .    as discussed by n02 , the sinusoidal variability detected with the _ chandra _ observation could have been due to a neutral hydrogen column being raised by the interaction of the accretion stream with the outer edge of an accretion disk @xcite",
    "the fact that the sinusoidal modulation was absent in the 2007 , and likely also the 2005 _ xmm - newton _ observations could suggest that the system is in a lower accretion state , and might indicate that the geometry of the outer disk region has changed .",
    "it has been hypothesized that the hard tails of quiescent neutron stars originate from a pulsar wind , only able to turn on in quiescence , that is interacting with the accretion stream at large radius @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of both the hard tail and the sinusoidal modulation in 4u  2129 + 47 could suggest that what we had observed in the _ chandra _ observation was indeed the interaction between the pulsar wind and the disk edge , perhaps as the last remnants of a disk accreted onto the neutron star .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that for these current _ xmm - newton _ observations the fitted neutral column is @xmath96@xmath97 , which is comparable to the value measured for the least absorbed / peak of the _ chandra _ lightcurve .",
    "we note that a dominant nonthermal component has been reported in a `` recycled '' system : the binary radio millisecond pulsar psr j0024@xmath57204w .",
    "the x - ray variability observed in psr j0024@xmath57204w suggests that the hard x - ray emission is produced by interaction between the pulsar wind and matter from the secondary star , which occurs much closer to the companion star than the millisecond pulsar @xcite . the previously observed hard tail in 4u  2129 + 47 might have been a similar phenomenon .",
    "what remains ambiguous is whether the associated drop in the 0.52kev absorbed flux is solely related to the vanishing of the hard tail , or whether additional cooling of the neutron star has occurred , or continues to occur .",
    "although the soft x - ray flux has clearly declined from the _ chandra _ observations to the _ xmm - newton _ observations , there is no evidence for a decline between the 2005 and 2007/2008 observations .",
    "the initial drop of the soft x - ray flux is consistent with solely the loss of the hard tail for some parameter regimes of this component ; however , for the best - fit parameters , additional cooling would have had to occur .",
    "we note that the expected luminosity of 4u  2129 + 47 due to neutron star cooling has recently been discussed by @xcite . even though 4u  2129 + 47 is among the brighter of the 23 quiescent sources presented by @xcite , the degree to which it is `` too faint '' , and thus requires `` non - standard '' cooling ( kaon cooling , pion cooling , etc . ; see @xcite and references therein ) relies on the rather uncertain average heating history of 4u  2129 + 47 , and the knowledge that the bulk of the observed soft x - ray emission was _ not _ due to residual accretion .",
    "we note that any implied reduction of the soft x - ray emission of 4u  2129 + 47 , or any continued cooling observed in the future , increases the need to invoke `` non - standard '' cooling mechanisms for this system , and further limits the parameter space for the long term average heating that would allow for `` standard '' cooling .",
    "a question also arises as to whether or not the loss of the hard x - ray tail is in any way related to the unusual timing residuals associated with the 2005 _ xmm - newton _ observations ( b07 ) .",
    "strong deviations from a simple linear or quadratic ephemeris have also been noted for the bursting neutron star system exo  0748@xmath5676 @xcite , with these changes possibly being correlated with the duration of the eclipse as viewed by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) .",
    "( note that comparable eclipse duration changes , @xmath98s , observed in exo  0748@xmath5676 are too small to have been seen in 4u  2129 + 47 with our observations . )",
    "@xcite hypothesize that these eclipse duration and ephemeris changes are related to magnetic activity within the secondary .",
    "we note , however , that over a comparable five year span , the peak - to - peak residuals of exo  0748@xmath5676 ( 70s ) are three to four times smaller than the peak - to - peak residuals seen in 4u  2129 + 47 ( 200300s ) . furthermore , the trend of ephemeris timing residuals of exo  0748@xmath5676 are more persistently in one direction ( although deviations do occur ) than those that we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( compare to fig .  4 of @xcite ) .    in our work",
    ", we confirmed the strong deviations of two 2005 xmm - newton eclipses from any linear or quadratic ephemeris , however , this deviation has only been observed once since 1982 . rather than presuming ephemeris residuals comparable to those of exo  0748@xmath5676 , given the optical observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we instead have adopted the hypothesis of a triple system .",
    "given the lack of constraints , however , we had to assume a sinusoidal function for simplicity . with this assumption , the chance of detecting a maximal time deviation and a minimal deviation should be equal .",
    "the rare presence of the strong deviation may be due to a large eccentricity of the third body orbit , so that the third star rarely interacts strongly with the inner binary system .",
    "the third body orbital period was estimated to be around 175 days , but can not be uniquely determined with the current observations . in order to confirm and accurately determine the orbital period of the third body , further observations are required .",
    "such future observations could also address whether the soft x - ray flux of 4u 2129 + 47 has continued to drop , and whether the hard tail and sinusoidal modulation remain absent .",
