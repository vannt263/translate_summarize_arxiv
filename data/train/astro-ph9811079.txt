    "the magnetic fields observed in stars , accretion discs and galaxies are generally considered to be generated by magnetohydrodynamic dynamo action .",
    "the complexity of the physics of such dynamos has meant that a fully self - consistent model is beyond the range of the computational resources currently available , although important attempts have been made to understand turbulent dynamos in stars ( nordlund _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , brandenburg _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) and accretion discs ( brandenburg _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , hawley _",
    "_ 1996 ) , for example .",
    "such studies have had to be restricted to the geometry of a cartesian box , thus they are in essence local dynamos .",
    "however , magnetic fields in astrophysical objects are observed to exhibit large scale structure , related to the shape of the object , and thus can only be captured fully by global dynamo models . in some cases it has been possible to show that , for fully three - dimensional turbulence simulations , the dependence of the results ( parity , time dependence , cycle period , etc . ) on global properties including boundary conditions is remarkably similar to that of the corresponding mean - field dynamo models ( brandenburg 1999 ) .",
    "this lends some support to the validity of mean - field theory , which is used in the following .",
    "mean field dynamo models , which attempt to capture such geometric features , have been employed extensively in order to study various aspects of the dynamics of solar , stellar and galactic dynamos ( see for example , steenbeck & krause 1969 , roberts & stix 1972 ) . often the dimensionality of the underlying partial differential equations has been reduced by assuming axisymmetry . as the presence of strong differential rotation tends to destroy non - axisymmetric fields ( e.g.rdler 1986 ) , this restriction has some astrophysical justification , but nevertheless some galaxies and types of stars are known to have non - axisymmetric fields and so this simplification can not be universally valid .",
    "in addition to producing solutions with pure and mixed parities ( brandenburg _ et al .",
    "_ 1989a , b ) , these studies have also revealed new features such as solutions with both chaotic behaviour ( see for example jones _",
    "_ 1985 in a severely truncated system , brooke & moss 1994 , torkelsson & brandenburg 1994b , tavakol _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) and intermittent modes of behaviour ( see e.g. brooke & moss 1995 ; tobias & weiss , 1997 ; tworkowski _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , covas _ et al . _",
    "1998a ) .",
    "an important shortcoming of these models is that they involve severe approximations , which essentially fall into two broad categories .",
    "there are those concerning the underlying physics , such as approximations involved in the parameterisation of the turbulent processes in solar and stellar convective zones ( which are not known precisely ) , and there are the simplifications assumed in modelling the phenomenological features of these systems , such as the details of their geometries .",
    "these shortcomings are often ignored , the assumption being that changing the details of these models should not change their behaviours qualitatively . a priori , however , there are no reasons why this should be so and it is therefore important that this assumption should be checked .",
    "recently , an attempt was made to study the robustness of axisymmetric mean - field models in spheres and spherical shells with respect to changes in the functional form of the @xmath0 effect ( tavakol _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) and also by considering the @xmath0quenching to be dynamic ( covas _ et al . _",
    "here we shall employ the usual algebraic @xmath0quenching and focus on the second feature discussed above , namely the assumptions regarding the topology and geometry of these models .",
    "this is important for two reasons .",
    "firstly , these are the two important features differentiating the astrophysical situations in which such dynamos are thought to be operative .",
    "thus spherical and spherical shell models are considered in connection with solar and stellar variability ( with the sphere or shell representing convectively unstable regions of stars ) , whereas disc ( torkelsson & brandenburg 1994a , b , 1995 ) and torus ( brooke & moss 1994 ; 1995 ) models are considered in connection with modelling accretion discs and galaxies .",
    "secondly , the geometries of these models are often only approximations to the true shapes of the astrophysical systems , and so it is important to know the sensitivity of the dynamo solutions to modest changes in geometry .",
    "this is particularly true for dynamo models in accretion discs and galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we study the qualitative nature of the dynamical behaviour of axisymmetric mean - field dynamo models as a function of changes in their topology , following transitions from sphere to shell to torus , and as a function of changes in their geometry resulting from alteration of the shapes of the dynamo region , whilst retaining the topology .",
    "we consider these changes within a unified framework , using the same numerical code with the same boundary conditions , to solve the same dynamo equations . in the context of disc - like models",
    ", we also consider changes in the rotation law .",
    "the models considered here include geometric features such as curvature , which are naturally present in astrophysical systems .",
    "there have also been studies of more idealized models in cartesian geometry , and of low order models , which aim to describe generic features of axisymmetric dynamo solutions ( e.g.  weiss , cattaneo & jones 1984 , jennings _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , jennings & weiss 1991 , jennings 1991 , tobias _",
    "it is of interest to determine whether such features persist across changes in geometry and topology and in the highly nonlinear regimes considered here .",
    "we shall briefly return to this issue below in the light of our findings .    in section 2",
    "we briefly introduce the equations for the axisymmetric mean - field dynamo models together with the relevant boundary conditions .",
    "section 3 contains a discussion of our results and finally section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the standard mean - field dynamo equation ( cf .",
    "krause & rdler 1980 ) is of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the mean magnetic field and the mean velocity respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath0 ( the @xmath0 effect ) and the turbulent magnetic diffusivity , @xmath4 , appear in the process of the parameterisation of the second order correlations between the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . for the sake of simplicity , and to facilitate comparison with previous work , we shall ignore anisotropies and take @xmath0 and @xmath4 to be scalars .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 .",
    "nondimensionalization of the equations in terms of a length @xmath8 and a time @xmath9 produces the two usual dynamo parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are typical values of @xmath0 and @xmath14 . for the sake of comparison with existing results ( e.g. , covas _ et al . _",
    "1998a ) , we set @xmath15 throughout ( except briefly , in one particular case ) .",
    "we use spherical polar coordinates @xmath16 and consider axisymmetric solutions only . in order to satisfy the condition @xmath17 we solve eq.([dynamo ] ) by splitting the field into meridional and azimuthal components , @xmath18 , and expressing these components in terms of scalar field functions , so that @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "we consider the usual algebraic form of @xmath0quenching namely @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "this form has been adopted in numerous studies .    in our calculations",
    "we consider two types of rotation laws , one with constant shear and the other with approximately rigid rotation close to the rotation axis and tending to keplerian rotation at larger radii .",
    "hereafter we refer to the latter as a `` generalized keplerian '' rotation law .",
    "the first constant shear profile has been used extensively in studies in many different geometries .",
    "we recognise that helioseismological evidence indicates that the rotational profile of the sun gives a shear in a very concentrated region .",
    "our main aim is to allow comparison with a range of published models , hence we chose this simple and widely used form .",
    "the second profile has been extensively used in studies of accretion discs . in",
    "that it gives a differential rotation that decreases with radius it might be considered to give a generic representation of the rotation in a galactic disc , although rotation profiles in galaxies are certainly not keplerian .    for the rotation profiles that we will consider here , we take @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance from the rotation axis . for the first profile mentioned above , we shall , consistent with brandenburg _ et al . _",

    "the models we shall consider here are all constructed from a complete sphere of radius @xmath8 .",
    "we can remove an inner concentric sphere of radius @xmath36 ( in order to go smoothly from a sphere to a spherical shell ) . the change from a sphere or a spherical shell to a torus- or disc - like configuration is produced by excising a cone of semi - angle @xmath37 about the rotation axis , from the north and south polar regions .",
    "the configuration is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ boundary ] , where the dynamo region is produced by revolving the meridian section shown about the vertical dotted rotation axis through the origin @xmath38 .    in order to solve the dynamo equations ,",
    "boundary conditions need to be imposed on the surfaces of the dynamo region created by removing the cones ( denoted by @xmath39 ) , on the inner surface @xmath40 ( denoted by @xmath41 ) , and also on the outer curved boundary ( denoted by @xmath42 ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ boundary ] .",
    "we adopt a perfect conductor boundary condition , @xmath43 other choices are possible ( see , e.g. , tworkowski _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , but this has been used commonly in earlier investigations .    on @xmath44 a vacuum boundary condition has often been used .",
    "however this , although appealing , is actually quite arbitrary as , for example , there is no evidence that the solar poloidal field is curl - free immediately above the surface .",
    "when @xmath45 , implementing an essentially non - local vacuum boundary condition is not straightforward , and so we have chosen a plausible local condition .",
    "other authors have previously taken a radial field condition , @xmath46 , ( e.g.gilman & miller 1981 ) .",
    "we used @xmath47 which results in a poloidal field on @xmath44 which is typically near to radial over most of the boundary .",
    "we stress that , in the absence of a detailed model of processes above a stellar surface , all choices of boundary condition on @xmath44 are more - or - less arbitrary , within general restrictions of plausibility .    if a perfect conductor boundary condition is used on the surfaces @xmath39 then as @xmath48 the model does not tend to that used for the full sphere , where @xmath49 on the axis .",
    "thus we set @xmath50 to ensure continuity of behaviour as @xmath51 ; again other choices are possible .    in the following ,",
    "as is customary , we shall discuss the behaviour of the solutions by monitoring the total magnetic energy , @xmath52 , taken over the dynamo region given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we split @xmath55 into two parts , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are respectively the energies of those parts of the field whose toroidal field is antisymmetric and symmetric about the equator .",
    "the overall parity @xmath59 is given by @xmath60/e$ ] ( brandenburg _ et al . _ 1989a ) , so @xmath61 denotes an antisymmetric ( dipole - like ) pure parity solution and @xmath62 a symmetric ( quadrupole - like ) pure parity solution .    for the numerical results reported in the following sections",
    ", we used a modified version of the axisymmetric dynamo code of brandenburg _ et al . _",
    "( 1989a ) .",
    "we took a grid size of @xmath63 mesh points in the dynamo region . to test the robustness of the code we verified that no qualitative changes were produced by employing a finer grid , different temporal step length ( we used a step length of @xmath64 in the results presented in this paper ) .",
    "we considered a family of models ranging from a full sphere through spherical shells to torus- and disc - like configurations .",
    "we present the results of our comparative studies of dynamo solutions in regions that are produced by variations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the ranges @xmath65 ( in dimensionless units ) and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "in particular , we took the following values : @xmath67 to present our results , we use the following notation in the figures : the prefix `` steady '' denotes a constant energy , whilst `` a '' and `` s '' on their own respectively represent pure antisymmetric ( dipolar ) ( @xmath61 ) and symmetric ( quadrupolar ) ( @xmath62 ) solutions with periodically oscillating energy , `` om '' represents solutions which possess periodic oscillations in both parity and energy , and `` c '' and `` i '' denote chaotic and intermittent behaviours respectively . by intermittent behaviour we loosely mean irregular switchings between two or more different dynamical regimes characterised by different statistics .",
    "( for a precise characterisation of this type of behaviour in some dynamo models see covas _ et al .",
    "_ 1998a . )",
    "we should add here that the computational cost of our calculations limited the resolution to which we were able to search the parameter space .",
    "consequently all our results regarding the sequence of parity changes are subject to this limitation .",
    "since many previous authors have discussed behaviour at the onset of dynamo action , we shall present our results in two subsections .",
    "first we present our results concerning the onset of dynamo action as we go from a sphere through spherical shells to torus- and disc - like structures , and then we consider the dynamical behaviour for each configuration as the dynamo number is increased .",
    "our detailed results are presented in table [ onsetenergy ] and figs .",
    "[ onset ] to [ transition.planar ] .",
    "we summarise our onset results by considering the two types of deformation of the basic sphere in turn .",
    "starting with the case where an inner sphere is removed , giving a spherical shell , we note that roberts ( 1972 ) found numerically ( but for different boundary conditions ) that for an @xmath68 dynamo with a negative dynamo number , the most easily excited mode has dipole - like symmetry for @xmath69 , whereas for @xmath70 the most easily excited mode has quadrupole - like symmetry .",
    "our corresponding results are summarised in fig .",

    "in particular , the top row of this figure , summarizing the behaviour of a sphere and spherical shells without polar cones removed , agrees qualitatively with the results of roberts ( 1972 ) .",
    "the next three rows in this figure correspond to the removal of cones of semi - angles @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "these results indicate that despite the removal of the polar cones , the onset behaviour still remains the same as that given in roberts ( 1972 ) . in this way",

    "[ onset ] and [ onset_large ] , the onset behaviour in these models changes from oscillatory to steady solutions as the cut angle @xmath37 increases .",
    "such a change in behaviour has also been found in oblate spheroidal geometry as a sphere flattens to a disc - like configuration ( stix 1975 , soward 1992a , b and walker & barenghi 1994 ) . according to these authors ,",
    "the crucial factor in the change from oscillatory to steady behaviour is the aspect ratio of the spheroids , defined as the ratio of the minor to the major axis .",
    "they speculated that this was because dynamo waves were restricted from propagating in the vertical direction ( i.e.  parallel to the minor axis ) . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that in our case the only oscillating solution for @xmath94 = @xmath89 occurs when @xmath95 and the above aspect ratio is @xmath96 , as for a sphere .    in table",
    "[ onsetenergy ] we summarise the values of @xmath97 corresponding to the onset of dynamo action in each configuration . except for the case with generalized keplerian rotation law",
    ", this shows that for a fixed @xmath36 the values of @xmath97 at the onset of dynamo action increase as the cut angle @xmath37 increases for almost all configurations as the shells get thicker .",
    "we should also note that the steep increase in the onset value of @xmath97 , as we go from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , may be related to the transition from shell  like to disc  like configurations .",
    "table  [ onsetenergy ] in conjunction with figs .",
    "[ onset ] and [ onset_large ] confirm that in the constant shear case configurations with smaller polar cut angles follow the linear results due to roberts ( 1972 ) , while those with larger cut angles ( @xmath100 ) do not , thus suggesting the possible existence of a transition as the cut angle is increased .    for the disc  like configurations ( with @xmath101 ) , the onset of dynamo action is to a steady state when @xmath102 , when the symmetry is determined by the sign of @xmath103 .",
    "if this is positive , that is for the constant shear with @xmath104 and for the generalized keplerian rotation profile with @xmath105 , the onset modes are antisymmetric . for the negative case",
    "the onset mode is always symmetric .",
    "we present our results in the nonlinear regime in three stages .",
    "first we consider the transition from the full sphere to a spherical shell , then from a full sphere to that with axial cones removed and finally we study a full sphere with both an inner core and axial cones removed simultaneously .",
    "our detailed results are presented in figs.[none ]  [ largeminus ] , corresponding to five different values of @xmath37 .",
    "each contains four panels for each of the values of @xmath36 considered , the panels from top to bottom corresponding to @xmath36 values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively .",
    "we have concentrated mostly on the more usual case of negative dynamo number ( @xmath108 ) , but for comparison we also consider , for large @xmath37 , the case of a positive dynamo number ( @xmath109 ; see fig .  [ largeplus ] ) , as well as the case with generalized keplerian differential rotation , which is relevant for accretion discs ( figs.[keplerianplus][keplerianminus ] ) .    before discussing our results in detail we emphasise that the sequence of parity changes reported below are those that we found to within the resolution of the @xmath97 parameter employed here .",
    "it is therefore important to bear in mind that unless there is a clear theoretical reason for believing in the presence of a particular sequence of parity changes in the nonlinear regimes , it is always possible to miss finer details of such sequences for any given finite resolution in @xmath97 .",
    "our standard step in @xmath110 is 0.5 , but on occasion this was very much reduced ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ paritytimes ] ) .",
    "in addition , although we have attempted to integrate over times long enough to eliminate any transient effects , nonetheless , it is not possible to always rule out the presence of very long - lived transients . with these qualifications",
    "we proceed to discuss our results in more detail .    the results concerning the transition from a full sphere to spherical shells are shown in fig .",
    "this shows that the transitions , from the onset of dynamo action into the nonlinear regimes as @xmath97 increases , are the same for the full sphere and the two thickest shells ( i.e.  @xmath111 ) . all possess the same initial sequence of parity changes given by @xmath112 the only difference is that , as the shells become thinner ( @xmath36 increases ) , the sequence is compressed to a narrower interval of @xmath97 . for the thinnest shell ( @xmath113 ) , however , the initial sequence is @xmath114 when a polar cone is removed ( @xmath45 ) , the initial sequence of parity changes is the same for the full sphere and the two thickest shells for @xmath115 .",
    "the behaviour for the thinnest shell ( @xmath77 ) and the largest polar cut angle ( @xmath91 ) differ .",
    "we also observe that the removal of the polar cones causes more changeable and varied behaviour , as does the removal of the inner cores , providing that the first bifurcation is to an oscillating solution .",
    "figures [ very_small ] to [ medium ] show that there are similarities in the initial sequences of parity changes as @xmath37 changes .",

    "differences in the bifurcation sequences tend to appear at larger values of @xmath110 where the dynamo becomes more non  linear . also at these higher values of @xmath110 ,",
    "more exotic behaviours such as intermittency and chaos can appear , for example for @xmath120 and @xmath79 with @xmath75 and @xmath118 , @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and @xmath124 for all values of @xmath36 considered here , whilst chaotic and intermittent behaviour only occurs for @xmath125 when @xmath77 .    when @xmath126 ( fig .",
    "[ largeminus ] ) the behaviour is totally different .",

    "the effects of changing the rotation law to the generalized keplerian rotation law are depicted in fig .",
    "[ keplerianplus ] and , as can be seen , the steady @xmath127 mode and the subsequent oscillatory @xmath127 mode are stable for all values of @xmath110 considered . only in the case",

    "such a gap in the bifurcation diagram has been found earlier in connection with torus and accretion disc dynamos ( e.g.  brooke & moss 1995 , torkelsson & brandenburg 1994b , see also ruzmaikin _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 and stepinski & levy 1991 for linear results ) .",
    "immediately after this gap an antisymmetric mode appears .",
    "the existence of this gap does not appear to be a peculiarity associated with the particular value of @xmath129 we used , as we also found it when @xmath132 , a value chosen to give the same value of the rotational shear at the mean radius of the shell ( @xmath133 ) as the constant shear model with @xmath108 , shown in fig .",
    "[ largeminus ] .",

    "[ keplerianplus2 ] .",
    "it is clear from comparing fig .",
    "[ keplerianplus ] and fig .",
    "[ keplerianplus2 ] that the bifurcation sequence is sensitive to the value of @xmath129 , but the gap in which no field is excited remains .    when the sign of the generalized keplerian rotational shear is reversed ( fig .",
    "[ keplerianminus ] ) , a steady @xmath130 mode is again first excited , similar to the case of linear shear . only for @xmath77",
    "is the behaviour slightly different in that there is a @xmath127 mode that appears for @xmath134 .    in the above figures , the nature of the solutions ( and thus the symbols shown ) are all determined only to within the numerical resolutions chosen and for the length of of time during which solutions were followed and thus in which transients could decay .",
    "in particular , near the bifurcation points ( as in the case of transitions from pure parity a to s ( or vice versa ) ) , we find as expected extremely long transients ( at times of more than hundreds of diffusion times ) .",
    "bearing all this in mind , we do find some evidence which suggests that the conjecture by jennings & weiss ( 1991 ) , according to which transitions from one pure parity to the opposite are mediated by a mixed parity regime , may not always hold .",
    "an example of this type of transition is given in fig.[paritytimes ] , where we have used an exceptionally fine resolution in @xmath110 .",
    "in this case we found after some hundreds of diffusion times that with @xmath135 and @xmath136 the parity became @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "a conclusive resolution of this question requires a more substantial study , and we intend to return to this point in a future publication .    our results also indicate that overall the behaviour appears to be more complicated in shells than in the full sphere dynamo models , a feature also observed in covas _",

    "this corresponds with the findings of brooke & moss ( 1994 , 1995 ) , that chaotic behaviour was excited at modestly supercritical dynamo numbers in tori , whereas chaotic behaviour only occurred at highly supercritical dynamo numbers in disc and shell configurations .    to obtain an overview of the behaviour of the two parameter family of models considered here",
    ", we recall that table [ onsetenergy ] suggests the presence of three different regions with distinct onset behaviours in the parameter space @xmath143 . in the constant shear rotation law case two of these regions possess oscillatory dipolar and quadrupolar onset symmetries respectively and in the third the most readily excited field is steady and quadrupolar . these regions",

    "those results indicate the presence of two sharp transitions in mean energy and/or parity at around @xmath146 for @xmath147 and @xmath148 for @xmath149 .",
    "these features are also corroborated by the time series of energy and parity .",
    "finally , we have also examined the behaviour of our solutions as a function of the aspect ratio , which we defined as @xmath150 with this definition , the smallest aspect ratio corresponds to the configuration with @xmath77 and @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) , and the largest to that with @xmath153 and @xmath126 ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "we find that at large values of @xmath110 , for example @xmath155 , the averaged energy @xmath156 per unit volume of the dynamo region is largest for the configuration with the smallest aspect ratio , and vice versa .",
    "in addition , for these values of @xmath110 , we find that the average energy per unit volume decreases as @xmath37 increases ( i.e.  the cuts get larger ) and as @xmath36 decreases ( i.e.  the shells get thicker ) .",
    "we have made a comparative study of the dynamical behaviour of a two parameter family of axisymmetric mean - field dynamo models , ranging from a full sphere to shells to torus- and disc - like configurations , within a unified numerical framework .",
    "we have found overall agreement with previous studies of axisymmetric mean - field dynamos for spheres , shells , tori and discs .",
    "more precisely we find the following :    1 .",
    "our results show that changes in both topology and geometry affect the dynamical properties of our models , although these two factors are inevitably interlinked .",
    "specifically , we have three topologically distinct configurations , sphere - like , shell - like and torus - like . each of these topological configurations can undergo a continuous sequence of geometric changes , from flat objects where the vertical extent is much less than the horizontal , to objects where the vertical and horizontal extents are similar .",
    "our principal findings are that torus - like topologies seem to produce more complex behaviour and that , within a given topological configuration , modest changes in geometry can give rise to different bifurcation sequences .",
    "these findings may have considerable astrophysical significance , in that the actual shapes of galaxies and accretion discs often do not conform to the simple geometric shapes used in many studies of mean - field dynamos . also , since our study concerns the geometry and topology of the dynamo - active region , restrictions of the dynamo - active region in stellar convection zones may have important consequences for the behaviour of the dynamo and these should be taken into consideration when comparing the predictions of dynamo models with observed magnetic behaviour in astrophysical objects",
    "we confirm that the full sphere and shell results of roberts ( 1972 ) , concerning the symmetry of the onset modes , are robust with respect to changes in the outer boundary condition , and we extend them to the configurations with very small to medium polar cut angles .",
    "steady modes are found for the largest polar cut angles , agreeing with results from oblate spheroidal geometry .",
    "these modes are robust under a change in the rotation law , as found by walker & barenghi ( 1994 ) , except in the case where the configuration resembles a thin torus rather than a disc . in this case",
    "an oscillating dipolar solution occurs at onset for a constant shear rotation law , but a steady quadrupolar solution is found with a generalized keplerian law . in the latter case",
    "the steady solution disappears at higher values of @xmath110 and there is a gap before an oscillating antisymmetric solution appears . such a gap",
    "was previously observed with a generalized keplerian rotational profile in both disc ( torkelsson & brandenburg 1994b ) and torus geometry ( brooke & moss 1995 ) .",
    "stepinski & levy ( 1991 ) also found a similar gap in linear theory .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of a gap does depend on the nature of the nonlinearity : it is absent if magnetic buoyancy is the dominant nonlinearity ( torkelsson & brandenburg 1994a ) .",
    "our results here indicate the steady solution is also fragile with respect to changes in the rotation law .",
    "3 .   for the largest polar cut angle",
    ", we find evidence for a different mode of behaviour in the thinnest shell ( @xmath77 ) from that found in the thicker shells and full sphere , namely a more complicated behaviour with denser bifurcation sequences , including chaotic and intermittent solutions .",
    "apart from the thinnest shells ( @xmath77 ) the dynamics is qualitatively the same for each sign of the shear .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the thinnest shell approximates a setting in which curvature plays a smaller role .",
    "4 .   we note a consistent finding in our results , that dynamo - active regions corresponding topologically and geometrically to a torus exhibit chaotic behaviour at lower dynamo numbers compared to spherical , shell - like or disc - like configurations .",
    "this concurs with the results of brooke & moss ( 1994,1995 ) , who found transition to chaotic behaviour for a dynamo in a toroidal volume at dynamo numbers that were approximately three times supercritical .",
    "given that the solar ( and possibly some stellar ) magnetic cycle exhibits irregularity on a variety of time scales , and that many authors have speculated that such behaviour is a manifestation of deterministic chaos , this result may have some astrophysical significance .",
    "it therefore seems worthwhile to investigate such dynamos , with a variety of rotational profiles , possibly corresponding to different types of stars , and using different forms of nonlinearity to saturate the field .",
    "since it is the restriction of the dynamo active volume to a toroidal configuration that appears to be important , these dynamos could be considered as embedded in convective shells representing the outer regions of stars .",
