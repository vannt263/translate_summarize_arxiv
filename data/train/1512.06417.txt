    "this article is about the graphical structure of a link diagram .",
    "specifically , we prove that any link can be represented by a diagram whose regions ( including the unbounded one ) possess @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 sides ; we call these _ delta diagrams_. more precisely , we prove that , starting from a braid closure representation of the link , we can deform it in order to obtain an equivalent delta diagram , see theorem [ thm : deltadiagram ] .",
    "delta diagrams are particular cases of lune - free diagrams  diagrams which do not possess regions with @xmath3 sides ( lunes ) . in this context , the present article is a sequel to @xcite , where we proved that any link diagram can be deformed into a lune - free diagram .",
    "we called this process `` delunification '' .",
    "we showed this process can be realized via finite sequences of reidemeister moves .",
    "furthermore , we proved we can choose these finite sequences of reidemeister moves so that a diagram equipped with a non - trivial fox coloring , preserves its number of colors all the way through its delunification .",
    "thus , the minimum number of colors is attained on lune - free diagrams and we can search for these minima over the smaller class of lune - free diagrams . as of @xmath4 crossings things become intractable . perhaps with a subclass of lune - free diagrams things would become intractable at a ( much ) later stage ?",
    "this prompted us into the investigations which led to the current article .",
    "we warn the reader that the links studied in this article are non - split links .",
    "that is , they do not isotope into disconnected components .",
    "the reason is that disconnected components can be resolved into delta diagrams on their own .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : prelim ] we introduce the relevant definitions and the auxiliary results . in section [ sect : proof ] we prove the main result , the fact that a knot or link can be represented by a diagram whose regions have @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 sides  called below delta diagrams . in subsection [ subsect : conseqkinks ] we present an upper bound on the number of crossings produced by the transformation into a delta diagram . in section [",
    "sect : discharging ] we prove that a connected lune - free diagram has at least one triangle which is adjacent to another triangle or to a tetragon or to a pentagon ( theorem [ thm : dis ] ) .",
    "we prove this result using the method of discharging .",
    "this result prompts us to define invariants which we list in subsection [ subsect : featureinvs ] . in section [",
    "sect : invs ] we define further invariants associated to the delta diagrams and lune - free diagrams . finally , in section [ sect : questions ] we list a number of questions for future research .",
    "the article @xcite came to our attention after writing the present one . in it",
    "the authors give a different proof that links have delta diagrams .",
    "we feel our proof is significantly different from theirs to justify publication of the current article .",

    "we acknowledge the contributions of the referee  in particular , subsection [ subsect : conseqkinks ] stems from the referee s remarks .",
    "we call delta diagram any diagram of a knot or link whose regions have 3 , 4 , or 5 sides .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hopflink ] we illustrate how to obtain a delta diagram for the hopf link from the braid closure of @xmath5 .",
    "this treatment of the hopf link is completely different from that we will be applying to the other knots and links .",
    "our technique will rely on drawing arcs through regions in order to break them down into regions with less sides . at this point",
    "the following lemma is crucial .",
    "[ lem : main ] in order to break down a region into regions with less sides by drawing an arc through it , the arc has to skip two sides .",
    "regions with @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 sides can not be broken down into regions with less sides @xmath6greater than @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : skip2lemma ] shows that it is only as of skipping @xmath3 sides that an arc drawn through a region is able to break it down into regions with less sides ( but more than @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : skip2lemma345 ] shows where this procedure does not work .",
    "specifically , with a @xmath0-sided region it is not possible to skip @xmath3 sides . with a @xmath1-sided region",
    "if @xmath3 sides are skipped , then @xmath8 sides will be also skipped . with a @xmath2-sided region if @xmath3 sides are skipped than @xmath9 side will also be skipped .",
    "this concludes the proof .    leaning on the representation of knots or links as closures of braids , for braid words with more than two letters , we prove that any knot or link has a delta diagram .",
    "we develop a technique based on the introduction of kinks ( see figure [ fig : kinkification ] ) that allows us to obtain a delta diagram equivalent to the braid closure form in which the knot under study was originally represented .",
    "we remark that final product is no longer a braid closure .",
    "figures [ fig:10 - 35 ] through [ fig:10 - 35 - 5kink ] below illustrate the case for knot @xmath10 regarded as the braid closure of @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the reader should examine first figure [ fig:10 - 35 ] and then figure [ fig:10 - 35 - 5kink ] since they stand for the beginning and the end of the introduction of kinks . the reader should note that in figure [ fig:10 - 35 ] there are regions which do not have the appropriate number of sides , namely , with 2 or with 6 sides in this example ( figure [ fig:10 - 35 ] ) ; by figure [ fig:10 - 35 - 5kink ] the diagram has been transformed into a delta diagram .",
    "specifically , we introduce a sequence of nested kinks from arc @xmath9 around the braid entanglement , in the first part of the process , to break down the majority of regions whose number of sides is not @xmath0 , nor @xmath1 , nor @xmath2 , see figures [ fig:10 - 35 - 1kink ] through [ fig:10 - 35 - 4kink ] . then we introduce a kink from arc @xmath3 to break down any region left over from step @xmath9 ( or created in step @xmath9 ) , which does not have the appropriate number of sides into regions with the appropriate number of sides , see figure [ fig:10 - 35 - 5kink ] .",
    "we now prove the main theorem of this article .",
    "[ thm : deltadiagram ] each knot or link can be represented by a @xmath12-diagram .",
    "the proof for the hopf link is in figure [ fig : hopflink ] .",
    "the reader should look at figures [ fig:10 - 35 ] and [ fig:10 - 35 - 5kink ] since they stand for the beginning and the end of the kinkification applied to a knot , in this case @xmath10 .",
    "the proof relies on the fact that each knot or link can be represented as the closure of a braid ( cf .",
    "we remark that we insist on having a braid word with an even number of @xmath13 .",
    "should we not have it , we add a last `` @xmath14 '' which is the identity . furthermore , as illustrated with the knot @xmath10 ( see figures [ fig:10 - 35 ] , [ fig:10 - 35 - 1kink ] , [ fig:10 - 35 - 2kink ] , [ fig:10 - 35 - 3kink ] , [ fig:10 - 35 - 4kink ] , [ fig:10 - 35 - 5kink ] , and also figure [ fig : terminology ] for terminology ) , our technique splits the diagram obtained from the closure of a braid into a new diagram whose regions , or certain unions of regions which we call sections , fall into the following categories , at the end of the step @xmath9 : non - middle sections , the middle section , lateral regions , top - to - bottom regions , see figure [ fig : terminology ] .",
    "this proof analyzes these regions and sections , and checks that those that do not yet have the required number of sides by the end of step @xmath9 , will obtain them upon the performance of step @xmath3 .",
    "we now refer the reader to figures [ fig : nonmiddlesection ] , [ fig : middlesection ] , [ fig : lateralregions - new ] , [ fig : lateralregionsconc ] , [ fig : toptobottom - new ] , [ fig : toptobottomregionsc ] , [ fig : toptobottomconc - new ] where these checks are done .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "we observe that at the end of the step @xmath9 of our kinkification of the braid closure in order to obtain a delta diagram , we obtain a braid closure again .",
    "it is only after step @xmath3 of the process that we end up with a diagram other than a braid closure",
    ". it would be interesting if it would be possible to modify step @xmath3 so that the final product would be a braid closure .",
    "furthermore , we have control over the number of crossings of our final product .",
    "let @xmath15 be a link and @xmath16 be the crossing number of @xmath15 .",
    "then the increase in the number of crossings of the delta diagram obtained by kinkification as described in the proof of theorem [ thm : deltadiagram ] @xmath6when compared with the number of crossings of a minimal diagram of @xmath17 is bounded above by @xmath18 where @xmath19    we begin by noting that the number of seifert circles for any diagram of @xmath15 is bounded above by the number of crossings .",
    "this follows from the fact that , since @xmath15 does not have trivial components , then the number of seifert circles is maximized on a diagram where as we go along it , from each crossing there stems a seifert circle .    also , the braid index is bounded above by the number of crossings .",
    "we now consider a diagram of @xmath15 with @xmath20 crossings .",
    "then we apply vogel s procedure ( @xcite ) to obtain a closed braid from it along with the following bound for the number of crossings on the resulting braid closure : @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the number of seifert circles @xcite .    assuming our braid closure now has @xmath23 crossings we will now apply our kinkification procedure in order to obtain a delta diagram from it . in step @xmath9 , for each pair of crossings we introduce a kink ( @xmath24 more crossings ) and each of these hover about the braid entanglement twice ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 stands for the number of strands in the braid ) .",
    "then at the end of step @xmath9 we have @xmath27 more crossings .",
    "now for the contribution of step @xmath3  the reader may want to view figure [ fig:10 - 35 - 5kink ] again .",
    "arc @xmath3 goes over the strands of the original braid ( left , @xmath28 crossings produced ) .",
    "then it goes over the arcs produced by the introduction of the kinks in step @xmath9 ( twice , actually , so @xmath29 crossings produced ) .",
    "then it goes over the middle section ( @xmath30 crossings produced ) .",
    "then over the arcs produced by the kinks introduced in step @xmath9 again ( already accounted for ) . finally , it adds @xmath0 more crossings at the bottom of the diagram .",
    "the total contribution of step @xmath3 for the increase on the number of crossings is then @xmath31 hence the kinkification increases the number of crossings , @xmath23 , by adding not more than @xmath32 crossings to the braid closure it was applied to .",
    "we now compose this result with the preceding estimate of not more than @xmath33 crossings from the passage from diagram to closure of braid .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "[ thm : dis ] in a connected lune - free diagram , there is at least one triangle which is adjacent either to another triangle , or to a tetragon , or to a pentagon .",
    "let @xmath34 stand for the number of regions with @xmath35 sides on a given diagram .",
    "then , from euler s formula ( see @xcite ) , @xmath36 which amounts to    @xmath37 in particular , any lune - free diagram has @xmath38 .",
    "thus it amounts to @xmath39 therefore any lune - free diagram has to have triangles since the remaining coefficients are negative or zero .",
    "we regard each of the coefficients in this formula as a _ charge _ associated with a region .",
    "each region with @xmath35 sides is assigned the charge @xmath40 .",
    "note that only triangles have positive charge .",
    "we are now in a position to make an argument by _ discharging _ ( see @xcite ) . by discharging we mean taking a positive amount of charge from a region and placing it in an adjacent region . for example",
    "suppose we have a triangle with charge @xmath9 and an adjacent region with charge @xmath20 .",
    "change the charge on the triangle by subtracting @xmath41 and the charge in the adjacent region to @xmath42 .",
    "the total sum of the charges remains the same .",
    "now suppose that no triangle in the diagram is adjacent to a @xmath0-gon , a @xmath1-gon or a @xmath2-gon .",
    "consider discharging triangles into regions with @xmath35 sides , @xmath43 , as described above .",
    "the worst case is when every edge of the region has a discharge .",
    "then the new charge in the region would be @xmath44 for @xmath43 .",
    "thus by discharging all the triangles we would have the sum of all the charges less than or equal to zero .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "and therefore we conclude that there must be at least one triangle which is adjacent to a @xmath1-gon or a @xmath2-gon .",
    "in figure [ fig:6exceptional ] we present an example of a planar tetravalent graph and of a link diagram without 2-sided regions and whose triangles do not share edges with tetragons nor pentagons .      in this section and the next we give a number of feature invariants of knots and links .",
    "a feature invariant is obtained from a combinatorial property of a diagram by minimizing over the appearance of the number of such properties in all diagrams that represent a given knot or link .",
    "for example , every diagram has a certain number of crossings . by minimizing the crossing number",
    "we obtain an invariant that is usually called the minimal crossing number of a knot of link . here",
    "we have features such as adjacency of triangles with other triangles and we can minimize or maximize the count of such occurrences .",
    "there are many feature invariants suggested by the present work , and we hope that some of them will turn out to be significant for the theory of knots and links .",
