    "numerical simulations of freely decaying turbulence show that vortex interactions play a crucial role in the dynamics of two - dimensional viscous flows @xcite . in particular , vortex mergers are responsible for the appearance of larger and larger structures in the flow , a process which is directly related to the celebrated `` inverse energy cascade '' @xcite .",
    "although nonperturbative interactions such as vortex mergers are extremely complex and desperately hard to analyze from a mathematical point of view @xcite , rigorous results can be obtained in the perturbative regime where the distances between the vortex centers are large compared to the typical size of the vortex cores .    as an example of this situation ,",
    "consider the case where the initial flow is a superposition of @xmath3 point vortices .",
    "this means that the initial vorticity @xmath4 satisfies @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the initial positions and @xmath7 the circulations of the vortices .",
    "let @xmath8 be the solution of the two - dimensional vorticity equation @xmath9 with initial data @xmath4 , where @xmath10 is the velocity field defined by the biot - savart law @xmath11 solutions of , with singular initial data of the form were first constructed by benfatto , esposito , and pulvirenti @xcite .",
    "more generally , if @xmath12 is any finite measure , giga , miyakawa , and osada @xcite have shown that the vorticity equation has a global solution with initial data @xmath4 , which moreover is unique if the total variation norm of atomic part of @xmath4 is small compared to the kinematic viscosity @xmath13 .",
    "this last restriction has been removed recently by i.  gallagher and the author @xcite , so we know that has a unique global solution @xmath14 with initial data , no matter how small the viscosity coefficient is .",
    "this solution is uniformly bounded in @xmath15 , and the total circulation @xmath16 is conserved .    in the vanishing viscosity limit",
    ", the motion of point vortices in the plane is described by a system of ordinary differential equations introduced by helmholtz @xcite and kirchhoff @xcite .",
    "if @xmath17 denote the positions of the vortices , the system reads @xmath18 and the initial conditions @xmath19 for @xmath20 are determined by .",
    "a lot is known about the dynamics of the _ point vortex system _ , see e.g. @xcite for a recent monograph devoted to this problem .",
    "most remarkably , is a hamiltonian system with @xmath3 degrees of freedhom , which always possesses three independent involutive first integrals . in particular , system is _ integrable _ if @xmath21 , whatever the vortex circulations @xmath22 may be . in the simple situation where @xmath23 , both vortices rotate with constant angular speeed around the common vorticity center , see fig.1(left ) . in the exceptional case where @xmath24",
    ", there is no center of vorticity and the vortices move with constant speed along parallel straight lines , see fig.1(right ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the discussion above shows that the dynamics of weakly interacting viscous vortices is essentially driven by two different mechanisms : _ diffusion _ , which is responsible for the continuous growth of the vortex cores , and _ advection _ , which creates the motion of the vortex centers and the deformation of the vortex profiles .",
    "the latter effect persists in the vanishing viscosity limit , and it is therefore reasonable to expect that , if we can find solutions of euler s equation describing widely separated gaussian vortices , these inviscid solutions will provide an accurate approximation of the viscous @xmath3-vortex solution considered in theorem  [ thm1 ] , if @xmath13 is sufficiently small .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to explore this idea in the particular case of a single _",
    "vortex pair_. in this simple situation , we only need to consider solutions of euler s equation that are stationary in a uniformly rotating or translating frame .",
    "assume thus that @xmath23 and , for definiteness , that both circulations @xmath25 are positive . given @xmath26 such that @xmath27 , let @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we consider the inviscid vorticity equation in a rotating frame with angular speed @xmath30 : @xmath31 formally , the vorticity distribution @xmath32 is a stationary solution of . in the laboratory frame , this corresponds to a time periodic solution of where both vortices rotate around the origin with angular velocity @xmath30 . now , let @xmath33 be a nonnegative vorticity profile which is radially symmetric , decreasing along rays , and normalized in the sense that @xmath34 . given @xmath35",

    "existence of such `` desingularized '' solutions of euler s equation has been investigated in a recent work by d. smets and j. van schaftingen @xcite .",
    "in fact , the authors of @xcite do not consider rotating vortex pairs of the form , but they treat a variety of other interesting cases , including a single stationary vortex in a bounded or unbounded domain , a rotating vortex in a disk , and a translating vortex pair in the plane .",
    "they use the `` stream function method '' , which consists in constructing ( by variational methods ) a nontrivial solution to an elliptic equation of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a power - like nonlinearity which depends on @xmath0 in an appropriate way .",
    "the vorticity @xmath42 is then a stationary solution of . for technical reasons ,",
    "the desingularized vorticity profiles obtained in @xcite are always compactly supported , but it is reasonable to expect that similar results can be obtained with gaussian profiles too .",
    "we hope to clarify this issue and to extend the results of @xcite to pairs of vortices of the same sign in a future work .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "below , we study in detail the case of two identical vortices ( @xmath43 ) . for a large class of",
    "radially symmetric profiles @xmath44 , we prove the existence of approximate stationary solutions of of the form .",
    "in other words , we construct an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath0 of the vorticity distribution as a steady state of . under natural symmetry assumptions ,",
    "we show that this expansion can be performed to arbitrarily high order .",
    "then , in section  [ sec3 ] , we prove that the solution @xmath45 of the rotating viscous vorticity equation @xmath46 with initial data is very close to the inviscid stationary solution @xmath47 with asymptotic profile @xmath48 , if @xmath2 is sufficiently small .",
    "this means that , when the viscosity is small , the solution of with initial data slowly travels through a family of uniformly rotating solutions of euler s equation , whose vorticity profiles are approximately gaussian and evolve diffusively .",

    "if the vorticity distribution is given by , this condition is satisfied if @xmath35 is sufficiently small . here , we find it more convenient to fix the size of the vortex cores , and to assume that the distance @xmath50 between the centers is large .",
    "this alternative point of view is of course equivalent to the previous one , up to a rescaling .",
    "note , however , that the rotation speed @xmath30 will now depend on @xmath50 and behave like @xmath51 as @xmath52 .    from now on ,",
    "we fix @xmath49 , @xmath53 , and we look for a stationary solution @xmath54 of describing a pair of identical vortices with circulation @xmath55 .",

    "given any such profile , we shall construct perturbatively a family of approximate solutions of , indexed by the parameter @xmath53 , which converge to @xmath44 as @xmath52 . under natural assumptions ,",
    "these approximate solutions are uniquely determined by the asymptotic profile @xmath44 .",
    "an important question that we leave open here is whether we can actually construct _ exact _ solutions of which converge to @xmath44 as @xmath52 , in which case our approximate solutions could be recovered by truncating the asymptotic expansion of the exact solutions . as was mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it should be possible to prove the existence of such solutions , at least for a particular class of compactly supported profiles @xmath44 , by adapting the variational techniques of d. smets and j. van schaftingen @xcite .",

    "this condition also implies that @xmath44 is a stable solution of the two - dimensional inviscid vorticity equation , with respect to perturbations in @xmath99 @xcite .",
