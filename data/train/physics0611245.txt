    "for instance , fat tails were found by pareto in the distribution of wealth  @xcite ; the first description of financial time series through statistical mechanics , made by l. bachelier in his phd thesis  @xcite , also represents the first formalization of a stochastic process in terms of the random walk model ; large fluctuations were observed by mandelbrot in the time series of cotton price  @xcite . on the other hand , physics has often represented a prototype for modelling economic systems .",
    "for example , many works of paul samuelson were inspired by thermodynamics ; the analogies between physics and economics were studied by jan tinbergen in his phd thesis entitled `` minimum problems in physics and economics '' .",
    "recent developments of economics rely more and more on the theory of stochastic processes and the science of complex systems  @xcite .",
    "the present paper considers some models of wealth exchange between individuals or economical entities , introduced independently in different fields such as social sciences , economics , and physics .",
    "we refer to them as _ kinetic wealth - exchange models _",
    "( kwem ) , since they provide a description of wealth flow in terms of stochastic wealth exchange between _ agents _ , resembling the energy transfer between the molecules of a fluid  @xcite .",
    "in order to maintain the discussion at a fundamental level , we limit ourselves to the following simple kwems : those introduced by angle ( a - models )  @xcite , bennati  ( b - model )  @xcite , chakraborti and chakrabarti  ( c - model )  @xcite , and by dragulescu and yakovenko  ( d - model )  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the paper is to discuss their general common features , formulation , and stationary solutions for the wealth distribution .",
    "we consider a heterogeneous kwem , in order to illustrate how a simple kwem can generate realistic wealth distributions .",
    "we also clarify some relevant issues , recently discussed in the literature , concerning the relaxation to equilibrium and the appearance of a power law tail of the equilibrium distribution in heterogeneous models .",

    "however , it has become clear that ( a ) the actual shapes of wealth distribution at intermediate values of wealth are well fitted by a @xmath2- or an exponential distribution  @xcite , so that they can be reproduced also by simple kwems with homogeneous agents ( see sec .",

    "we have reviewed some basic kwems of closed economy systems , introduced by scientists working in different fields , allowing us to point out analogies and differences between them .",
    "we have first considered the homogeneous models and then discussed the influence of heterogeneity .",
    "the heterogeneous kwems are particularly relevant in the study of real wealth distributions , since they can reproduce both the exponential shape at intermediate values of wealth as well as the power law tail .    in all the models discussed , including the heterogeneous one , the equilibrium wealth distribution of a single agent is well fitted by a @xmath2-distribution , known to be the canonical distribution of a general harmonic system with a suitable number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this suggests a simple mechanism underlying the ( approach to ) equilibrium of these systems , similar to the energy redistribution in a mechanical system .",
    "however , a general demonstration that the @xmath2-distribution is the stationary solution of kwems and an understanding of how it arises is still missing ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for theoretical considerations on and the microeconomic formulation of this issue ) .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed how in a heterogeneous kwem the sum of the single agent wealth distributions can produce a power law tail . in particular , we have clarified some issues concerning the relaxation process and the existence of power law tails : whenever there is a finite cutoff in the saving parameter distribution , the largest time scale of the system is finite and one observes a fast ( exponential ) relaxation toward a power law , which extends over a finite interval of wealth .",
    "the width of such interval depends on saving parameter cutoff .    due to the similarity of the structures of the models discussed ,",
    "we have proposed a novel unified reformulation based on the introduction of suitable stochastic variables @xmath179 , representing the _ actual fraction of wealth lost by the @xmath116-th agent _ during a single transaction .",
    "this unified formulation lends itself easily to further generalizations , which can be obtained by modifying the stochastic properties of the variable @xmath179 only , while leaving the general evolution law unchanged .",
    "we have illustrated the new formulation by working out in detail an example , in which the fraction of wealth lost @xmath179 is characterized by a lower as well as an upper limit .    besides the kwems considered in the present paper , originally formulated through finite time difference stochastic equations , other relevant ( versions of ) kwems have been introduced in the literature ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "their mathematical formulation can be similar to the one of the present paper  @xcite , or different approaches can be used , such as matrix theory  @xcite , the master equation  @xcite , the boltzmann equation  @xcite , the lotka - volterra equation  @xcite , or markov chains models  @xcite .",
    "all these models share a description of wealth flow as due to exchanges between basic units . in this respect , they are all very different from the class of models formulated in terms of a langevin equation for a single wealth variable subjected to multiplicative noise  @xcite",
    ". the latter models can lead to wealth distributions with a power law tail .",
    "in fact , they converge toward a log - normal distribution , which , however , does not fit real wealth distributions as well as a @xmath2-distribution or a @xmath195-distribution and is asymptotically characterized by too large variances  @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that even though kwems have been the subject of intensive investigations , their economical interpretation is still an open problem .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that in the framework of a kwem the agents should not be related to the _ rational agents _ of neoclassical economics : an interaction between two agents does not represent the effect of decisions taken by two economic agents who have full information about the market and behave rationally in order to maximize their utility .",
    "the description of wealth flow provided by kwems takes into account the stochastic element , which does not respond by definition to any rational criterion .",
    "also some terms employed in the study of kwems , such as _ saving propensity _ ( replaced here by _ saving parameter _ ) , _ risk aversion _ , etc .",
    ", can be misleading since they seem to imply a decisional aspect behind the behavior of agents . trying to interpret the dynamics of kwems through concepts taken from the neoclassical theory leads to obvious misunderstandings  @xcite . however , it is interesting to note that very recently , chakrabarti and chakrabarti have put forward a microeconomic formulation of the above models , using the utility function as a guide to the behavior of agents in the economy  @xcite .",
    "instead , kwems provide a description at a coarse grained level , as in the case of many statistical mechanical models , where the connection with the microscopic mechanisms is not visible ; however , the equivalence is maintained .",
