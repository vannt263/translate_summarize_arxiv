    "one of the important issues of high energy heavy ion collisions is to find and quantify the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition between the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at higher energy density and the hadron gas at lower energy density .",
    "the initial systems produced in the heavy ion collisions at the higher energies of the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the energy of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have high temperature and near - zero baryon chemical potential .",
    "lattice qcd calculations have shown that the transition at the vanishing baryon chemical potential is a crossover @xcite .",
    "however , it is predicted that this crossover will become a first - order phase transition at intermediate temperatures and high baryon chemical potentials .",
    "recently , the search for the evidences of the first - order phase transition and location of its critical end point have attracted special attention , for instance , the rhic and sps low energy programs @xcite and the project of the future facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi @xcite .",
    "two - particle hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry is a useful tool for detecting the space - time structure of particle - emitting sources in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "for the first - order phase transition there is a mixed phase of the qgp and hadron gas . in the absence of pressure gradient",
    ", a slow - burning fireball is expected when the initial system is at rest in the mixed phase , and this may lead to a considerable time - delay of the system evolution @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to probe the time - delay for the first - order phase transition by hbt interferometry .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an hbt analysis technique with quantum transport of the interfering pair ( qtip ) is developed .",
    "it takes into account the effects of resonance decay and multiple scattering of pions in the sources . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this hbt technique is used to investigate the source radius and lifetime for the spherical systems evolving hydrodynamically with the first - order phase transition . in this study",
    "we use the relativistic hydrodynamics in ( 2 + 1 ) dimension to describe the particle - emitting sources which undergo the first - order phase transition .",
    "we investigate the hbt radii @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 @xcite for the hydrodynamic sources using the hbt interferometry with the qtip technique .",
    "the results indicate that the ratio of @xmath4 to the transverse velocity of the particle pair @xmath5 is sensitive to the emission duration of the source .",
    "it is large when the system is initially located at the boundary of the mixed phase and the qgp ( soft point ) .",
    "as compared to pion hbt interferometry kaon hbt interferometry may present more clearly the source space - time geometry at the emission , because kaons ( for instance @xmath6 ) can escape easily from the system after their production . by comparing the results of the two - pion and two - kaon hbt analyses ,",
    "we find that the particle absorptions and the large expansion velocities of the sources after hadronization may change the pion hbt radii as functions of the transverse momentum of the particle pair . however , the large values of the ratio @xmath7 for the soft point of the first - order phase transition can be observed in both of two - pion and two - kaon hbt measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present briefly the description for the relativistic hydrodynamics in cylindrical coordinate frame .",
    "we describe the model of the equation of state ( eos ) of first - order phase transition used in our calculations . the adiabatic cooling paths and the space - time evolution of the systems are also discussed in this section . in section iii",
    "we perform the two - pion and two - kaon hbt analyses , with the qtip technique , for the hydrodynamic particle - emitting sources for the initial conditions of the qgp and the soft point of the first - order phase transition .",
    "the effects of source expansion , lifetime , and particle absorptions on transverse hbt radii are investigated . on the basis of the investigations",
    ", we introduce an observable to probe the long lifetime of the source for the initial conditions of the soft point .",
