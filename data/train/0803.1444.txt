    "revealing the distribution and nature of dark matter is one of the most interesting current challenges of particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "numerous candidates have been proposed and studied , including axions @xcite , neutralinos @xcite , kaluza - klein photons @xcite , kaluza - klein or string dilatons @xcite , and superheavy dark matter either directly from inflationary expansion @xcite or from preheating after inflation @xcite .",
    "unstable particles like axions and dilatons have to be very light , in the sub gev range , to survive long enough to serve as dark matter .",
    "however , neutralinos are usually assumed to have masses beyond 100 gev , although lower mass limits strongly depend on supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "another very interesting model for dark matter which can have a large mass is a stable electroweak singlet @xmath4 which couples to standard model matter exclusively through a coupling to the higgs boson @xmath5 , @xmath6 we focus in particular on the @xmath7 symmetric model proposed in @xcite , which also allows for a bare mass term for the singlet , but does not include higgs - singlet mixing terms .",
    "the lagrangian in the scalar sector is @xmath8 the derivatives @xmath9 are the appropriate @xmath10 covariant derivatives acting on the higgs field .",
    "we assume perturbative singlet - higgs coupling for our calculations of singlet annihilation cross sections in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "we report results in particular for @xmath11 and for @xmath12 .",
    "the singlet sector may also include a @xmath7 symmetric singlet self - interaction @xmath13 if the positive coupling @xmath14 is weak enough such that its loop contributions can be neglected in the present perturbative calculation of singlet annihilation cross sections .",
    "the assumption of perturbative couplings in the non - relativistic limit is compatible with the fact that the @xmath15 functions are positive in leading order in the couplings @xcite .",
    "we assume that the singlet vacuum expectation value vanishes , @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise the singlet - higgs coupling would yield a singlet - higgs mixing term @xmath17 .    later on we will also allow for a set of @xmath18 singlet states with a global @xmath19 symmetry and vanishing vacuum expectation values .",
    "this ensures mass degeneracy and universality of the singlet - higgs coupling strength @xmath20 .    the higgs - channel between dark matter and the standard model was denoted as a higgs portal in @xcite .",
    "the model provides a minimal renormalizable dark matter model @xcite .",
    "it has also been discussed as a model for quintessence in @xcite .",
    "mcdonald introduced the variant with a complex singlet @xcite , and effects of gauging the ensuing hidden u(1 ) symmetry are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the presence of the singlet coupling obviously modifies the higgs effective potential and impacts electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , eventually triggering a strong first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "a light electroweak singlet could reveal itself as missing energy in collider based higgs search experiments @xcite or in b decays @xcite .",
    "march - russell et al . pointed out that electroweak singlets and their fermionic partners in supersymmetric theories can also be very heavy , with masses up to 30 tev @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will be concerned with the prospects of observation of intermediate mass electroweak singlets through their annihilation products in cosmic rays .",
    "we will take the proposals of an electroweak singlet coupling through the higgs portal as a minimal renormalizable dark matter model seriously , and discuss possible annihilation signals under the assumption @xmath0 . the relevant mechanism for a sizable signal for an intermediate mass singlet would be annihilation through an intermediate higgs boson into @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons .",
    "because of the importance of the opening of the @xmath1 channel at 80 gev , we will denote the mass range @xmath21 as the intermediate mass range for electroweak singlets .",
    "proximity of @xmath22 to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and higgs peaks in the annihilation cross section increases the product @xmath23 substantially , thus potentially yielding a strongly enhanced flux of annihilation products from the galactic halo even without invoking boost factors from strong local dark matter overdensities .",
    "however , we will see that the effect of the enhanced annihilation cross section is partially compensated for in standard lee - weinberg theory for the creation of thermal relics , because the requirement @xmath24 together with @xmath0 will require @xmath18-plets of electroweak singlet states , and the net effect is a scaling of the flux @xmath25 .",
    "the strength of a direct galactic dark matter annihilation signal depends on the dark matter distribution in our galactic halo .",
    "the cosmic ray flux from a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) dark matter halo and a cored isothermal halo will be reviewed in section [ sec : halo ] .",
    "model independent limits on the flux will be discussed in [ sec : unit ] .",
    "annihilation cross sections which follow from the singlet - higgs coupling ( [ eq : coupl1 ] ) are reported in section [ sec : sigma ] .",
    "the application of lee - weinberg theory for intermediate mass electroweak singlets is discussed in section [ sec : lwabundance ] .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "annihilation of dark matter particles of mass @xmath22 and number density @xmath26 generates a diffuse cosmic ray flux at our location @xmath27 @xcite @xmath28 here @xmath29 if the annihilating particles are majorana to avoid overcounting of collisions @xcite , and @xmath30 otherwise ( assuming in the non - majorana case equal amounts of dark matter and anti - matter in the halo ) .",
    "the case of interest to us is @xmath29 .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath31 gives the number of particles per energy interval and per annihilation event for an event with initial energy @xmath32 .",
    "later on we will mostly focus on the photonic part @xmath33 , as charged and hadronic components of dark matter annihilation products are masked by a relatively larger cosmic ray background than photons or neutrinos .",
    "however , in the present section we will also discuss the fraction of the total flux of cosmic rays from dark matter annihilation products compared to the cosmic rays flux @xmath34 from all sources .",
    "the factor @xmath35 in equation ( [ eq : flux1 ] ) is the product of annihilation cross section and relative speed in the non - relativistic limit . for processes at high redshift or annihilation of very low mass particles ,",
    "thermal averaging @xmath36 would have to be included .",
    "for high redshift sources , redshifting of @xmath37 would also have to be included and the distance @xmath38 has to be replaced by the luminosity distance .",
    "however , for annihilation of heavy particles in the galactic halo , equation ( [ eq : flux1 ] ) and its corresponding line - of - sight counterparts below are perfectly adequate .",
    "equation ( [ eq : flux1 ] ) yields a cosmic ray flux averaged over all directions .",
    "if the detector is only sensitive to cosmic rays from a small solid angle @xmath39 sr , or if corresponding cuts can be applied , the observed flux per unit of solid angle is @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath40 the vector @xmath41 with length @xmath42 and direction @xmath43 is related to the vector @xmath44 in ( [ eq : flux1 ] ) through @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    the averaged flux ( [ eq : flux1 ] )",
    "is recovered from equation ( [ eq : flux2 ] ) in the following way .",
    "the observed flux for aperture @xmath47 is the integral along the line of sight @xmath48 , @xmath49 averaging @xmath50 over all directions yields the diffuse flux ( [ eq : flux1 ] ) , @xmath51    we will use equation ( [ eq : flux1 ] ) to estimate the averaged cosmic ray flux from dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo and equation ( [ eq : flux3 ] ) to estimate the diffuse cosmic ray flux along a line of sight orthogonal to the galactic plane .",
    "we refer to the differential fluxes ( [ eq : flux1],[eq : flux2 ] ) as inclusive fluxes .",
    "stable final states include photons , neutrinos , electrons , positrons , protons and anti - protons .",
    "the differential photon fluxes are found by substituting @xmath52 in equations ( [ eq : flux1]-[eq : flux3 ] ) .",
    "the density profile is assumed as an nfw profile @xcite , @xmath53 with a mass parameter @xmath54 and a scale radius @xmath55 kpc .",
    "these parameters correspond to the fit by klypin et al . to the galactic halo @xcite ,",

    "although of no practical relevance , we point out that the singularity at @xmath58 cancels between the last two terms in equation ( [ eq : flux1b ] ) . ]",
    "substitution of data for the galactic halo yields @xmath59 with the scaled energy variable @xmath60 . looking only along a line of sight",
    "orthogonal to the galactic plane to minimize background effects will cost approximately a factor 3 in observed flux from the galactic halo , @xmath61    cirelli et al .",
    "also compared their calculations with other density profiles @xcite , using the assumption of same local dark matter density .",
    "this yields for the isothermal cored profile @xmath62 a parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the absence of the central cusp reduces the flux averaged over all directions , @xmath64 but the flux along a line of sight perpendicular to the galactic plane is virtually unchanged and slightly increased due to the weaker local gradient in the dark matter distribution , @xmath65 we will report numerical results for the flux @xmath66 from equation ( [ eq : flux1c ] ) .",
    "the other fluxes can then easily be derived from equations ( [ eq : jperp]-[eq : iscperp ] ) .",
    "the fragmentation function into all final states must satisfy the energy sum rule @xmath67 an often used parametrization is @xmath68 we will use fiducial values @xmath69 , @xmath70 for numerical estimates .",
    "the two slope behavior of @xmath71 versus @xmath42 ( see e.g. fig . 17.1 in the review @xcite ) also suggests a phenomenological fit @xmath72 the values found by the hrs collaboration in @xmath73 annihilation at @xmath74 gev correspond to normalized values @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of these 2-temperature distributions is that they are very small , but do not vanish at @xmath79 .",
    "however , they work very well between @xmath80 .",
    "the shape of fragmentation functions is only weakly energy dependent between 12 gev and 202 gev @xcite , and dominated by the fragmentation properties of intermediate partons .",
    "therefore we also use ( [ eq : hrs ] ) for numerical work besides ( [ eq : mlla ] ) .",
    "we will use the differential photon fragmentation function proposed in @xcite , @xmath81 for the differential photon spectrum .",
    "this corresponds to about 11% photon energy yield .",
    "although we are primarily interested in cosmic ray fluxes from the higgs portal coupling ( [ eq : coupl1 ] ) , we would also like to point out that model independent estimates for cosmic rays from dark matter annihilation arise from unitarity limits and from limits on neutrino fluxes .",
    "another model independent limit arises from halo stability @xcite .",
    "however , this limit has been superseded by the neutrino limit for dark matter masses heavier than 0.1 gev @xcite .",
    "the unitarity limit on s wave annihilation cross sections @xmath82",
    "@xcite implies @xmath83 substitution in equation ( [ eq : flux1c ] ) yields a limit on the diffuse cosmic ray flux from galactic dark matter annihilation @xmath84 beacom et al . and",
    "yksel et al . recently found that limits on the diffuse cosmic neutrino signal and the halo signal can be used to impose stronger limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section for dark matter masses below 10 tev @xcite . between 10 gev and 10 tev , the cosmic and the isotropic halo neutrino flux limits approximately reduce the limit on the annihilation cross section @xmath85 .",
    "we take this into account through a correction factor @xmath86    comparison with the cosmic ray flux below 1 pev @xcite @xmath87 shows that a galactic dark matter annihilation signal could reach several per cent of the total differential cosmic ray flux if the annihilation cross section could get close to the upper limits either through sommerfeld enhancement or through resonance effects .",
    "we find @xmath88 e.g. for @xmath89 gev , @xmath90 the maximum of @xmath91 for the fragmentation function ( [ eq : mlla ] ) is 0.23 for @xmath92 . for the fragmentation function ( [ eq : hrs ] )",
    "the maximum of @xmath91 is 0.37 for @xmath93 .",
    "however , cosmic rays are strongly dominated by charged particles , while dark matter annihilation products are expected to contain a relatively higher neutral component of photons and neutrinos . @xmath3",
    "ray and neutrino observatories are therefore the primary search tools for dark matter annihilation products",
    ". we will use the diffuse photon background published by egret between 30 mev and 120 gev @xcite , @xmath94 for benchmarking .",
    "this is the diffuse photon flux observed by egret after subtraction of conventional galactic sources .",
    "it has been pointed out that improved models for standard sources could reduce the egret signal , see @xcite and references there .",
    "the sensitivity calibration beyond 1 gev has also been called into question @xcite .",
    "the energy range between 1 gev and 100 gev is particularly relevant for continuous photon signals from dark matter in the mass range of interest here , @xmath21 , and we will see that signal levels may be small .",
    "reliable further subtractions of standard sources from the diffuse @xmath3 ray background signal , and a lower total signal , would help to identify or constrain a possible dark matter signal .",
    "egret sets a useful benchmark until glast / lat publishes data on the diffuse @xmath3 ray background .",
    "normalizing the averaged photon flux following from equation ( [ eq : flux1c ] ) to the egret flux ( [ eq : egret ] ) yields @xmath95 the maximum of @xmath96 is @xmath97 near @xmath98 .",
    "therefore any annihilation cross section of a dark matter particle with a mass below 1.5 tev is constrained to @xmath99",
    "the coupling ( [ eq : coupl1 ] ) reduces in unitary gauge to @xmath100 for the annihilation of the electroweak singlet through an intermediate higgs , we also need the couplings @xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103    these couplings yield the following annihilation cross sections in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 with @xmath108 for quarks and @xmath109 for leptons .",
    "the @xmath110 cross section is summed over final spin states . the cross section @xmath111 contains the scattering amplitude from the @xmath112 contact vertex in equation ( [ eq : coupl2 ] ) , the scattering amplitude from the @xmath113-channel contribution with an intermediate higgs boson from the @xmath114 vertex in equation ( [ eq : coupl2 ] ) and the @xmath115 vertex in equation ( [ eq : couplhh ] ) , and the @xmath116-channel and @xmath117-channel amplitudes with an intermediate singlet from the @xmath114 vertex .",
    "those amplitudes are with the normalization @xmath118 , @xmath119    note that due to the constraint @xmath120 for @xmath121 , neither the @xmath113-channel resonance for @xmath122 nor the @xmath116-channel or @xmath117-channel resonance for @xmath123 can be realized for @xmath111 .",

    "an equivalent way to understand why the cross sections @xmath140 and @xmath141 do not vanish in the limit of vanishing coupling @xmath142 are the residual goldstone boson modes @xmath143 and @xmath144 from the higgs field , which would contribute to singlet annihilation in the @xmath10 symmetric limit .",

    "this is due to the fact that the corresponding singlet masses in table 2 are smaller and much closer to the peaks in the cross section .    for the flux calculations for @xmath275",
    ", we have to rescale the flux ( [ eq : flux1c ] ) by a factor @xmath276 , because the density factor @xmath277 for each annihilating species is now suppressed @xmath278 , but there are @xmath18 annihilating species of singlets of mass @xmath22",
    ". therefore we find with equations ( [ eq : flux1c ] ) and ( [ eq : lars1 ] ) @xmath279 the parameter @xmath280 varies only in the range @xmath281 for the solutions in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "however , @xmath282 scales with @xmath283 , and therefore the low - mass solutions from table 2 yield higher flux than the solutions from table 1",
    ". we will give results for @xmath282 in the case @xmath11 , @xmath271 , @xmath185 gev and @xmath284 gev , and also in the case @xmath12 , @xmath271 , @xmath185 gev and @xmath285 gev .",
    "the expected contribution to the photon flux below 120 gev in units of the egret flux is shown in figures [ fig : flux160285 ] and [ fig : flux160111 ] for the two cases .",
    "the corresponding number of photons per @xmath286 is given in figures [ fig : j160285 ] and [ fig : j160111 ] , respectivley .",
    "the integrated photon flux @xmath287 in the two cases is shown in figures [ fig : phi160285 ] and [ fig : phi160111 ] .",
    "for an instrument with an effective area of @xmath288 and a field of view of @xmath289 , comparable to the large area telescope on glast , the photon flux @xmath282 in figure [ fig : j160111 ] corresponds to an annual rate of 470 photons with energies between @xmath290 from dark matter annihilation on a diffuse astrophysical background of 90,000 photons per year .",
    "the flux in figure [ fig : j160285 ] corresponds to an annual rate of 48 photons with energies between @xmath291 from dark matter annihilation on a diffuse astrophysical background of 22500 photons per year .",
    "there are two characteristic features which would help to identify @xmath282 as an excess due to dark matter annihilation",
    ". the excess would extend over an energy range of order 10 gev , and it would be correlated with the galactic halo .",
    "we have considered perturbatively coupled electroweak singlet dark matter in the intermediate mass range @xmath269 .",
    "the leading order annihilation cross section of the singlets is enhanced and varies strongly due to proximity to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and higgs peaks .",
    "the product @xmath191 is of order @xmath292 for @xmath22 close to @xmath206 , i.e. it can substantially exceed standard estimates of dark matter annihilation cross sections even for perturbative singlet - higgs coupling .    for singlet masses above the @xmath182 threshold and electroweak strength coupling @xmath293 , the lee - weinberg condition and the requirement @xmath294 push @xmath22 to high mass values around 900 gev if there is only one singlet state .",
    "however , if there is an @xmath18-plet of electroweak singlets or if the coupling is weaker , @xmath195 , lower singlet mass values can be achieved , and the annihilation signal from the continuous @xmath3 ray spectrum can reach a level of several per mil of the egret diffuse @xmath3 ray signal for photon energies @xmath295 .",
    "this excess contribution over the expected cosmological background would appear typically over an energy range of order 10 gev , and its dark matter signature would be its correlation with the galactic halo .",
    "the flux reported by egret was the diffuse @xmath3 ray flux after subtraction of then known or expected galactic components .",
    "reduction of the diffuse `` excess '' @xmath3 ray flux due to subtraction of a larger component from interstellar gas and standard extragalactic sources increases the relative importance of an annihilation signal for any possible excess signal and improves detectability .",
    "the diffuse @xmath3 ray flux will be measured with higher sensitivity and precision in the near future by the large area telescope aboard the glast satellite .",
    "this will also cover a larger energy range up to 300 gev .",
    "the minimal dark matter models considered here include four basic parameters , the singlet mass @xmath22 , the number of singlet states @xmath18 , the singlet - higgs coupling @xmath20 , and the higgs mass @xmath206 .",
    "the assumption that electroweak singlets of mass @xmath22 provide the dark matter in the universe relates these parameters through lee - weinberg theory .",
    "measuring the higgs mass at the tevatron or the lhc will reduce the number of free parameters in this class of minimal dark matter models to two , or maybe even to only one free parameter if a missing energy signal can be used to constrain a combination of @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "the anticipated smallness of singlet annihilation signals in cosmic @xmath3 rays indicates that observation of the higgs particle at the tevatron or the lhc may be needed for a successful search for a singlet annihilation signal in cosmic rays .",
