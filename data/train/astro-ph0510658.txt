    "most bright x - ray transients last for weeks , and come from two kinds of systems : low - mass x - ray binaries where the compact object is either a black hole or a neutron star with a low magnetic field ( x - ray novae ) , and neutron star binaries with a high - mass , be - type companion ( be / ns ) . in the latter systems ,",
    "the neutron star is usually in a wide , eccentric orbit , and the outbursts often occur at regular intervals , separated by the orbital period , and generally close to periastron . these two classes can be distinguished from each other by neutron star pulsations , by optical observations of the companion to determine the compact object s mass , by regularity of recurrence ( which indicates a be / ns binary ) , or by their x - ray spectra .",
    "on 12 august 1997 , a new x - ray transient near the galactic center , , was discovered and localized using two serendipitous scans by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) _ , about 2.5  hr apart and in nearly perpendicular directions @xcite .",
    "null results from other _ rxte _ exposures to the field limited its duration to less than 11  dy .",
    "although this is unusually short for a be / ns binary outburst , and although no pulsations were detected despite a very high sensitivity to periods up to 300  s , we concluded that the system was probably a be / ns system with a long spin period and short outburst duration .",
    "this conclusion was based primarily on the x - ray spectrum , which was well fitted by an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum of temperature ( 21.6  @xmath2  0.8 )  kev , a spectral form typical of x - ray pulsars such as be / ns systems . the hydrogen column derived from the same _",
    "rxte _ spectrum , ( 6.2  @xmath2  0.2)@xmath3  @xmath4 , was consistent with absorption along the line of sight to the galactic center , reinforcing the conclusion that this was indeed a source in the galactic bulge  in which case it was also unusual as a be / ns outburst in its relatively high luminosity .    in this paper",
    ", we summarize all the x - ray observations of this system to date , revealing variations in spectrum , luminosity , and absorption column .",
    "we discuss the initial identification of the counterpart in the united states naval observatory ( usno ) and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogs .    in the companion paper ( * ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) we discuss the results of detailed optical and infrared spectroscopy of the companion . both of our original conclusions",
    " that this is a be / x - ray system and that it is located in the galactic bulge  are incorrect .",
    "the companion is a highly reddened blue supergiant in the foreground , and the absorbing material is local to the system ( paper ii ) .",
    "is therefore an unusual system in having a blue supergiant companion and very brief outbursts .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the connection of this object with other sources that have similar properties , defining a new subclass of high - mass x - ray binary system .",
    "we also discuss the possibility that the same flaring process is active in three continuously bright binaries that also have short outbursts and blue supergiant companions : cyg  x1 , vela  x1 , and 1e  1145.16141 .",
    "table  1 shows a summary of observations of outbursts of , along with the two sensitive observations made by focusing x - ray observatories .",
    "most of the outbursts discovered so far have been the result of two long - term studies with _ rxte _ , neither of them specifically directed toward this system .      since the start of _ rxte _ operations in 1996",
    ", we have been observing the black - hole candidate  regularly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , starting at monthly intervals and gradually increasing over the course of the mission to twice per week .",
    "the field of view of the _ rxte _ pointed instruments when observing  includes , at an off - axis position corresponding to a response of 20% relative to the center of the field ( because of the need to avoid other sources in the region ,  itself is placed at a relative response of 43% ) .",
    "was first discovered because _ rxte _ slewed almost directly across it during an outburst as it approached the  field on 12 august 1997 .",
    "just 2.5  hr previously , a scan that was part of a program to survey the galactic plane @xcite passed over the active  as well , allowing a two - dimensional localization to @xmath5 accuracy ( 99% confidence ; but see @xmath62.4 below ) .",
    "because  remained in the field of view during the whole 1300  s of the pointing toward , this episode also gave us the first good spectral and timing data from  @xcite .",
    "we have identified two other major outbursts in the series of pointings to , in 2000 november and 2002 june .",
    "figure  1 shows a differential lightcurve of the pca count rate in the  pointings since the start of 1997  each point has had the average of its two immediate neighbors subtracted out to remove the slow variations intrinsic to .",
    "the count rates shown are from the proportional counter array ( pca ) instrument , in the energy range 2.525  kev , normalized to a single proportional counter unit ( pcu ) and using the first xenon layer of the detectors only .",
    "detector pcu0 , which suffered a puncture in the middle of the mission , degrading its performance , is not used after that event .",
    "the transient outbursts we report were visible in all pcu units that were on at the time of observation .",
    "instrumental background was subtracted using the `` cmfaintl7 '' model , which is accurate to about 2% , @xcite ; the typical count rate due to  is on same order as the background .",
    "galactic diffuse emission , which is significant below 10  kev , was estimated by pointing to a blank field nearby @xcite .",
    "since this emission is constant it is irrelevant to the differential lightcurve in figure  1 , but it is important for spectroscopy .",
    "two points stand out : the discovery outburst early on , and a bright outburst in 2002 .",
    "we give the two moderately high points nearer the middle of the plot two very different interpretations .",
    "the second of them involves not just an increase in high energy counts in the field but also a decrease in low energy counts  we therefore take it to be a brief , unusual , temporary change in spectral state of @xcite .",
    "the earlier of these two points at around 200 c / s/5pcu , however , is consistent with an additional spectral component added on top of the average  spectrum from the previous and subsequent several pointings .",
    "the lightcurve of this pointing is similar to the two very bright outburst pointings in that it has significant low - frequency noise , which is never the case with  in its hard state ( figure  2 ) . if the expected  contribution is subtracted and the presumed  spectrum is fit , it shows extremely high absorption ( table  1 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of this outburst is then actually comparable to the other two events in this survey , although its raw count rate is much lower .",
    "table  2 shows the result of fitting each of these three pca outbursts from 2.525  kev with the optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model from @xcite as provided by xspec @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the thermal bremsstrahlung curve we fit to the first major outburst observed by _",

    "integral_/ibis / isgri data from the outbursts on mjd 52877 ( 26 august 2003 ) and mjd 52888 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "together , these results suggest that the intrinsic spectra in outburst are relatively consistent , although the amount of local absorbing material is highly variable . using the distance to  of 2.3",
    "kpc derived photometrically in paper ii , the bright outbursts peak at a few @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 in unabsorbed luminosity from 1200  kev ( table  2 )",
    ".      the pca galactic bulge scan campaign @xcite has taken data approximately every three days since 5 february 1999 .",
    "although spectral and fast - variability information are not obtained from these data , the identification of the outbursts with a particular source is much more secure , since the instrument s one - degree field of view is scanned rapidly over the galactic center region .",
    "figure  3 shows the lightcurve for  from this campaign .",
    "there is only one outburst whose order of magnitude is the same as the three bright outbursts found in the  campaign since 1996 .",
    "since we can not derive an absorption column for this event , we do not know if it is bright but highly absorbed or somewhat fainter than the other three .",
    "the superior ability of the scanning technique to distinguish between small outbursts from this source and small changes in  has allowed the identification of many much smaller outbursts ( table  1 , section 2 ) .",
    "it is possible that any number of the outbursts from the bulge scans might have been highly absorbed like the 2000 november event and therefore much more luminous than their count rate indicates .",
    "was later observed in outburst in galactic bulge data from the _ integral _ satellite @xcite .",
    "data products from three _ integral _ observing seasons of the galactic bulge are now publicly available from the _ integral _ science data centre ( isdc ) .",
    "figure  4 shows lightcurves from the ibis / isgri instrument over these three seasons , summed from 1371  kev .",
    "there is one very significant , multi - point flare in each season , and a number of minor peaks from 5 to 10 counts per second .",
    "@xcite show an additional outburst around mjd 52888.3 , with about half the peak flux of the event on mjd 52877 and a shorter duration .",
    "this interval is not available in the public data set shown in figure  4 .",
    "@xcite show much more detailed lightcurves of the outburst ( or series of outbursts ) on 53073/4 .",
    "the _ integral _ feature on mjd 52895 in figure  4 is only a single point with a larger than normal error bar , so we are not including it in our catalog of outbursts .",
    "two of the minor outbursts in the _",
    "rxte_/pca bulge scan data come just after major outbursts measured by _ integral _ , suggesting that some of the other `` minor outbursts '' in the _ rxte _ bulge scans may also be part of the decay or rise phase of larger events .",
    "the observation reported by @xcite is in the center panel of figure  4 , and is the longest in duration and fluence .",
    "the time structure of this event was shown by @xcite and is also shown in figure  5 . because _ integral _",
    "s coverage is much more continuous during an observing season than _ rxte _ s , it is the _ integral _ observations that show us the true characteristic durations of outbursts from , from about 2  hr to about half a day .",
    "we observed  with the acis - i ccd on _ chandra _ on 15 october 2001 , for 5 ksec in timed exposure ( te ) mode .",
    "the observation was not made in response to any outburst , but was scheduled at the convenience of the observatory .",
    "we found about 0.25 counts per second from the only significant point source in the field of view .",
    "the position of this object is shown in figure  6 .",
    "it falls within the quoted error circles from _ asca _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* % confidence ) and _ integral _ ( * ? ? ? * confidence level not quoted ) .",
    "it falls barely outside the 99% confidence levels from _ rxte _ in the 1997 outburst @xcite and the 2001 outburst .",
    "we note , however , that _ rxte _ is not an imaging instrument , nor were the slews we used to produce these localizations optimized for the purpose , as are those of the galactic bulge campaign @xcite .",
    "the 99% confidence limit for 1997 was based on a set of simulations of the effect of intrinsic variations in the count rate of the source .",
    "these variations can distort the position derived from a slew , which also relies on a time - varying count rate .",
    "the 99% confidence limit was based on an assumption that the intrinsic source variation during the slew was no bigger than the variations observed in 1300  s of subsequent pointing to the source . if this assumption was violated , that confidence limit was too restrictive .",
    "the circle shown for 2001 simply repeats the uncertainty derived from the 1997 outburst .    although the observed count rate would normally cause moderate pileup in acis ",
    "i , the source turned out to be 4@xmath9 from the pointing axis .",
    "the point - spread function at that distance is broad enough to spread the image over many more pixels than would have been the case on axis .",
    "separate spectra taken from the core and wings of the image were consistent with each other , indicating that there is no problem with pileup .",
    "spectrum was well fit by a hard power law ( see table  1 ) . when we attempted to fit it with the thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum that matched the _",
    "_ data in outburst ( table  2 ) , we found that the limited energy range of _ chandra _ did not allow us to constrain the temperature .",
    "the same problem appeared when the _ rxte _ data were artificially constrained to the same energy range ( below 10  kev ) .",
    "but the power law fits in this restricted range show that the low - level emission was harder than the outburst emission ( table  1 ) .    in the 210  kev band",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity is 8@xmath10 erg s@xmath8 at 2.3  kpc . assuming a spectrum identical to the 1997 outburst",
    ", the bolometric luminosity in x - rays of all energies would be 2.8 times higher . because we can not see where the _ chandra _ spectrum starts to turn over , we do not know if the true bolometric luminosity was somewhat more or less than this value . as pointed out by @xcite , the state we observed with _",
    "chandra _ is not `` quiescent '' , even though no attempt was made to trigger on an outburst .",
    "the _ asca _ upper limit ( see below ) is , after all , an order of magnitude lower than the _",
    "flux ; and the observation by @xcite of the similar source igr  j175442619 in quiescence showed a much lower flux and a very soft spectrum , entirely different from the hard spectra seen by _",
    "chandra _ and _ rxte _ for .",
    "the lightcurve , shown in figure  2 , has a root mean square ( rms ) variability of 36.5% , compared to an expectation of 35.2% from poisson noise , using the binning time of 32.41  s shown in figure  2 . in the absence of any nonuniformity in the instrumental response over the course of the observation , this suggests an intrinsic rms variability of 10% .",
    "fourier analysis of the lightcurve shows no significant pulsations .",
    "the position derived from this _ chandra _ pointing was right ascension = @xmath11 , declination = @xmath1 , j2000 @xcite ; it enabled us to search for the optical counterpart of the system ( see below ) .      the single upper limit shown in table  1 , from _ asca _",
    "@xcite , is included because it is the deepest such limit for this source , and because it occurred in the same observation that fortuitously saw the start of a major outburst ( mjd 51248.3 , table",
    "1 ) immediately afterward . due to the variable absorption column from",
    ", we can not use this upper limit to directly place a limit on the unabsorbed flux . although the source was much fainter than when observed by _",
    "chandra _ , we can not say whether this was due to a higher absorption column or intrinsically fainter emission .",
    "however , by assuming that the absorption column was the same as during the outburst immediately following , @xcite found the 3@xmath12 upper limit for the observed flux shown in table  1 . removing the effect of absorption and placing the source at 2.3  kpc ( paper ii ) , this corresponds to 7.0@xmath13 erg s@xmath8 at 2.3  kpc .    the fact that this source was not discovered prior to 1997 puts implicit upper limits on the frequency of its outbursts .",
    "figure  1 suggests a duty cycle of @xmath14 1% for the bright outbursts from most of the pointings of _ rxte _ to ; the _ rxte _ bulge scans ( figure  3 ) and _ integral _ ( figure  4 ) are better able to separate sources , and suggest that there is a continuous range of outburst luminosities from the upper limit seen with _",
    "asca _ to the low level seen with _ chandra _ up to the brightest outbursts observed .",
    "a series of explicit upper limits dating from 1988 to 1996 were reported by @xcite in a retrospective analysis of data from the ttm coded - mask x - ray telescope , part of the _ roentgen astrophysical observatory _ on the kvant module of the mir space station .",
    "these upper limits are quoted as ranging from 930  mcrab during 21 different pointing series .",
    "each series consisted of a number of pointings spread over an interval varying from about a day to a month . due to the very short duration of outbursts from this source ,",
    "the upper limits that are summed from the more widely spread series may not be as meaningful as the ones based on data taken during a single day .",
    "the _ chandra _ position derived for  is approximately 0.65@xmath15 from a bright star in the usno  b1.0 catalog , 05960585865 ( 052528760590 in the usno  a2.0 catalog ) .",
    "the red and blue magnitudes in the first usno epoch ( r1 and b1 ) are 13.16 and 17.32 , respectively , and in the second epoch ( r2 and b2 ) are 12.93 and 16.97 .",
    "this star is also a bright 2mass source , 173911553020380 , with j=8.60 , h=7.82 , and k=7.43 .",
    "figure  7 is a raw color / magnitude diagram of usno a2.0 stars within 1@xmath9 of the _ chandra _ position .",
    "the star that is consistent with the _ chandra _ position is marked with a box ; it is a very bright and very red star for the field .",
    "a statistical analysis of a larger field ( 3@xmath9 in radius ) gives the probability of any usno a2.0 star coming within 0.65@xmath15 of the _ chandra _ position by chance as @xmath16 .",
    "the probability of such a coincidence with a star as bright as 052528760590 is @xmath17 and the probability of coincidence with a star with as red a b - r color as 052528760590 is @xmath18 .",
    "followup spectroscopy of this star was taken in the visible and in the infrared by two of us ( in and teh , respectively ) , and is reported in detail in paper ii .",
    "the brightness of the companion demands a location closer than the galactic bulge , despite the position of the source within 2  of the galactic center and its high x - ray absorption .",
    "paper ii gives a distance estimate of 2.3  kpc based on the new spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "there have been no pulsations reported from any of the outbursts in table  1 , with very strong upper limits up to a period of 300  s from the first reported outburst @xcite .",
    "the _ asca _ outburst of 1999 , caught at its very beginning , showed 2 peaks with a deep valley between them , separated by approximately 1500  s @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that all three outburst lightcurves in figure  2 have a variation consistent with that period , although it is very close to the duration of the observation .",
    "lightcurves of several of the _ integral _ outbursts in @xcite show peaks separated by approximately 2000  s. since the duration of the outbursts is only a few times this period , it is difficult to ascertain whether there is a true pulsar spin period in this range or whether this is just a typical timescale of whatever drives the outburst . either a much larger database of events or a serendipitous observation of a particularly long outburst will probably be needed to resolve this question .",
    "@xcite discovered a transient source in the scutum region with _",
    "asca _ , designated ax  1845.0 - 0433 , that turned on abruptly in the middle of the observing interval , showing violent variations for several hours until the pointing ended .",
    "this behavior was remarkably similar to the _ asca _ observation of  several years later @xcite .",
    "like , this object had a very hard spectrum in outburst , reminiscent of an x - ray pulsar , but no pulsations were observed .",
    "@xcite found an o9.5i supergiant within the _ asca _ error circle that they identified as the counterpart .",
    "two x - ray transients recently discovered with _",
    "integral _ also have very fast timescales : igr  175442619 @xcite and igr  164654507 @xcite . both have blue supergiant companions , estimated as spectral type o9ib and b0.5i , respectively @xcite .",
    "the similarities of both to  in x - ray behavior and photometry led us to predict a blue supergiant companion for the latter source @xcite , which we later confirmed spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "rough distance estimates based on photometry have been published for these systems : 3.3 , 8.5 , and 12.5  kpc for , igr  175442619 , and igr  164654507 respectively @xcite and 3.6  kpc for ax  1845.00433 @xcite ( see paper ii for the derivation of the improved value of 2.3  kpc for ) .",
    "these four systems seem similar enough to classify them as a new subclass of high - mass x - ray binary , which we designate supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxt ) .",
    "@xcite also pointed out the growing connection between fast variability and probable wind accretion .",
    "the unknown mechanism that drives the fast outbursts may be at work in other systems as well .",
    "three persistently bright x - ray binaries with blue supergiant donors have recently been reported to show extremely bright outbursts far beyond their normal luminosity , lasting on the order of hours : pulsars vela  x1 @xcite and 1e  1145.16141 @xcite , and cyg  x1 , the canonical black - hole binary , which has shown six such events @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism of this sort of fast outburst is not specific to the nature of the compact object .",
    "it may lie either in a sudden expulsion of material from the companion ( @xcite discusses the possible role of a clumpy wind ) or an instability particular to the small accretion disks expected in a wind - accreting binary .",
    "the great differences in persistent flux between the sfxt sources like  and the bright sources that also flare quickly may lie in the size of the orbit or the level of activity in the companion ; from what is known or deduced about the orbits and winds of these systems , however , there is not yet any clear correlation with persistent x - ray emission .",
    "the large and variable local absorption in some of the systems may eventually provide a clue to the outburst mechanism .",
    "vela  x1 shows a similar broad range of high absorption column values to  @xcite .",
    "cyg  x1 has a much lower absorption column ( usually below 10@xmath19 @xmath4 ) , which varies over about a factor of four with the orbital phase of the binary ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who also suggest that partial covering by a clumpy wind provides a better spectral fit than a simple absorption model ) .",
    "there have been no published observations of the large outbursts of vela  x1 , cyg  x1 or 1e  1145.16141 using instruments sensitive below 10  kev that can measure absorption .",
    "not every fast x - ray transient can be put into the sfxt category . flare stars and rs  cvn systems have long been known to produce short x - ray flares , but these tend to have softer spectra and a nearly isotropic distribution , demonstrating that they are nearby ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray superbursts can also have durations comparable to sfxt flares , but they generally occur on neutron stars that produce ordinary type  i x - ray bursts and can be recognized by their characteristic luminosity , lightcurve , and long recurrence time @xcite . there have also been short outbursts from three unusual x - ray binary systems that do not have the same sort of companions as the sfxts : ci  cam @xcite , v4641  sgr @xcite , and a  053866 @xcite .",
    "the outbursts from the former two systems were highly super - eddington , which distinguishes them from the events discussed here , and were never repeated ; the last , a well - known but mysterious system , is thought to be an extreme short - period be / x - ray binary , and has shown the regular , periodic outbursts often seen in that class .",
    "the 4.7  s pulsar ax  j1841.00536 , discovered by @xcite with _ asca _ , showed flaring by a factor of 10 with a rise time of about 1  hr , and the authors proposed that it might be a new member of the same class as  and ax  1845.0 - 0433 ; _ integral _ later detected a flare with a 10-minute risetime that may have come from the same system @xcite .",
    "@xcite used _ chandra _ to identify the counterpart of ax  j1841.00536 , which they reported as having features of the b spectral class .",
    "they also observed a weak , double - peaked h@xmath20 profile , which they used to identify the companion as a be star .",
    "this feature can also appear in interacting ob supergiants , however , and @xcite did not report any diagnostics of the luminosity class of the system .",
    "sax  j1818.61703 @xcite , xte  j1901 + 014 @xcite , and ax  j1749.12733 @xcite are all fast transients whose optical counterpart is unknown , as was recently pointed out by @xcite .",
    "now that a tentative connection has been made between supergiant companions and fast variability , detailed study of the unclassified optical counterparts to all these systems should be a high priority .    *",
    "note to be added in proof : * _ the recent association of short , hard gamma - ray bursts with older stellar populations in galaxies at z@xmath140.2 @xcite , and the strengthening of the ns / ns or ns / bh merger hypothesis for these events , encourages a search for the progenitors of these systems .",
    "although we are just beginning to study how numerous the sfxts might truly be , they seem to be a good candidate for the parent population .",

    "<S> the x - ray spectrum is hard both at low levels and in outburst , but somewhat variable , and there is strong variability in the absorption column from one outburst to another . although no pulsation has been observed , the outburst data from multiple observatories show a characteristic timescale for variability on the order of 15002000  s. the _ chandra _ localization ( right ascension @xmath0 , declination @xmath1 , j2000 ) shows that despite being located less than 2  from the galactic center and highly absorbed ,  is actually a foreground object with a bright optical counterpart . the combination of a very short outburst timescale and a supergiant companion is shared with several other recently - discovered systems , forming a class we designate as supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) . </S>",
    "<S> three persistently bright x - ray binaries with similar supergiant companions have also produced extremely short , bright outbursts : cyg  x1 , vela  x1 , and 1e  1145.16141 . </S>"
