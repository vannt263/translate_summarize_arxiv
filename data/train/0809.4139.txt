    "many empirical studies report broad distributions of income and wealth of individuals and these distributions are often claimed to have power - law tails with exponents around two for most countries @xcite .",
    "the first models attempting to explain the observed properties appeared over fifty years ago @xcite .",
    "much more recently , physics - motivated kinetic models based on random pairwise exchanges of wealth by agents have attracted considerable interest @xcite .",
    "an alternative point of view is adopted in the wealth redistribution model ( wrm ) where agents continuously exchange wealth in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "there are also several specific effects which can lead to broad wealth distributions @xcite .",
    "( for reviews of power laws in wealth and income distributions see  @xcite , while for general reviews of power laws in science see @xcite . )    in this paper we analyze the wrm with two complementary goals in mind .",
    "firstly we investigate the simplest case when exchanges of all agents are identical , focusing on the validity of the mean - field approximation which is the standard tool to solve the model and derive the stationary wealth distribution .",
    "in particular , we show that for any finite number of agents there is no such stationary distribution ( other finite - size effects are discussed for a  similar model in  @xcite ) .",
    "secondly we investigate the model s behaviour when the network of agent exchanges is heterogeneous .",
    "previous attempts to investigate the influence of network topology on the model  @xcite were all based on the mean - field approximation .",
    "we show that this is questionable because heterogeneity of the exchange network strongly limits the validity of results obtained using the mean - field approximation .",
    "adopting the notation used in  @xcite , we study a simple model of an economy which is composed of @xmath0 agents with wealth @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . the agents are allowed to mutually exchange their wealth ( representing trade ) and they are also subject to multiplicative noise ( representing speculative investments ) .",
    "the time evolution of agents wealth is given by the system of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 controls the noise strength .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 quantifies the proportion of the current wealth @xmath6 that agent @xmath7 spends on the production of agent @xmath8 per unit time .",
    "we assume the it convention for sdes and @xmath9 is standard white noise  @xcite .",
    "hence , denoting averages over realisations by @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "by summing @xmath14 over all agents one can see that the average wealth @xmath15 is not influenced by wealth exchanges and obeys the sde @xmath16 .",
    "therefore @xmath17 and @xmath18 is constant . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath19 ( @xmath2 ) and thus @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "( the influence of the initial conditions is discussed in . )",
    "the system behaviour is strongly influenced by the exchange coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath22 where all exchanges are equally intensive  we say that the exchange network is homogeneous . by rescaling the time we can set @xmath23 which means that during unit time agents exchange all their wealth .",
    "consequently , simplifies to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average wealth of all agents but agent @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath26 ,",
    "fluctuations of @xmath27 are negligible and one can replace @xmath28 as in  @xcite .",
    "agents then effectively interact only with the `` mean field '' and their wealth levels are independent . using the fokker - planck equation for the wealth distribution @xmath29 , the stationary solution @xmath30 can be found in the form @xmath31v_i^{-1-\\lambda},\\quad \\lambda:=1 + 1/\\sigma^2.\\ ] ] for @xmath32 , @xmath30 decays approximately as a  power - law with exponent @xmath33 , while the cumulative distribution has exponent @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath1 is well described by , we say that the system is in the _ power - law regime_.    the empirical studies mentioned above report power - law exponents around @xmath35 , indicating that in this model , @xmath36 is needed to obtain realistic power - law behaviour of the wealth distribution .",
    "in our analytical calculations we assume @xmath37 ; strong noise ( @xmath38 ) is discussed separately at the end of the following section .",
    "to examine when the power - law regime is realised , we first investigate the time needed to reach the mean - field solution .",
    "such relaxation times were studied very recently in kinetic models of wealth distribution  @xcite .    given the homogeneous initial conditions @xmath19 ( @xmath2 ) , the exchange terms proportional to @xmath39 are zero at @xmath40 and can be neglected for small times .",
    "hence when @xmath41 is small , each @xmath42 evolves independently due to multiplicative noise , @xmath42 is lognormally distributed , and its variance is @xmath43(t)=\\exp[2\\sigma^2t]-1=2\\sigma^2t+o(t^2)$ ] : we say that the system is in the _",
    "free regime_. from the known variance @xmath44 of the mean - field solution , we can estimate the transition time @xmath45 between the free regime and the power - law regime as @xmath46 when @xmath47 , the system has been given enough time to reach the power - law regime .",
    "we now recall the average wealth @xmath48 . while @xmath17 , one can see that @xmath49 is always positive .",
    "hence the variance @xmath50 $ ] grows without limit , in contradiction with the variance of which is finite for @xmath37 . to resolve this disagreement we have to accept that @xmath30 as given by is not a  stationary solution .",
    "but what comes after the power - law regime ?",
    "since the fokker - planck equation for the joint probability distribution @xmath51 can not be solved analytically , we answer this question by investigating the average quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) ; now we are considering @xmath37 and hence both are well defined .",
    "due to the assumed homogeneous network of interactions and the chosen initial conditions , all averages @xmath52 are identical and the same holds for the cross - terms @xmath53 ; effectively we are left with only two variables . from the it lemma",
    "it follows that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "after substitution of and averaging over all possible realisations , we obtain the exact set of equations",
    "@xmath57,\\\\ \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}{\\langle v_i(t)v_j(t)\\rangle}}{{\\mathrm{d}}t}&=\\frac2{n-1}\\,\\big [ { \\langle v_i^2(t)\\rangle}-{\\langle v_i(t)v_j(t)\\rangle}\\big].}\\ ] ] since we set @xmath19 ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath20 and the initial conditions are @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; for the general case see",
    ". independently of the initial conditions , for @xmath60 , has only the trivial stationary solution @xmath61 .",
    "this confirms that for a  finite @xmath0 , there is no stationary distribution @xmath30 .    by solving one",

    "small time expansions can be found in the form @xmath63(t)&=&2\\sigma^2\\,t+o(t^2),\\\\ \\label{c - smallt } c_{ij}(t)&=&\\case1{n-1}\\,t+o(t^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as can be seen , agrees with our previous reasoning about the log - normal nature of @xmath30 in the free regime , while confirms that in the limit @xmath26 , wealth correlations vanish .    in the limit of large time",
    "we obtain @xmath64 thus , as @xmath41 increases , the system passes to the _ synchronized regime _ where the wealth of agents is strongly correlated .",
    "one can estimate the transition time by comparing the initial linear growth of @xmath65 with its stationary value , leading to @xmath66 an alternative estimate can be obtained from @xmath43(t)$ ] .",
    "apart from a constant , it contains only terms proportional to @xmath67 $ ] where @xmath68 since @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and for @xmath71 is @xmath72 , the terms proportional to @xmath73 $ ] cause the initial saturation of @xmath43(t)$ ] but the terms proportional to @xmath74 $ ] eventually take over and cause the divergence of @xmath43(t)$ ] .",
    "the corresponding transition time can be roughly estimated by solving @xmath75 , yielding @xmath76 both @xmath77 and @xmath78 describe the transition between the power - law and synchronized regimes : the former focuses on the growth of correlations , the latter on the growth of variances .    to verify the presented analytical results we investigated the model numerically . for numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations we used milstein s method  @xcite ;",
    "random numbers were generated using the standard gsl library and the mersenne twister generator  @xcite , and the time increment was @xmath79 in all simulations . in the used discretisation scheme , there is a  non - zero probability that the wealth @xmath42 becomes negative  @xcite .",
    "however , thanks to the typical value of @xmath42 and the small time step , in the presented numerical simulations this was not an issue . as can be seen in  a",

    "b the number of agents is large and the system behaviour is more complex . in the initial period",

    "all these quantities are ensemble - based : if many copies of the system evolve independently for time @xmath41 , by examining the final wealths of agent @xmath8 one can estimate both the distribution @xmath29 and the averages .",
    "by contrast , when one speaks about an empirical wealth distribution , that is based on the wealth of all agents in one realisation only , it is population - based .",
    "however , when the number of realisations and the number of agents are large and the wealth correlations are small , ensemble- and population - based quantities are alike .",
    "such behaviour was observable also in the numerical simulations presented above .",
    "in the free and power - law regimes , the variance of wealth in each realisation was similar to @xmath88 $ ] ( at various times , differences were less than @xmath89 for @xmath90 and less than @xmath91 for @xmath92 ) and its relative fluctuations between realisations were approximately @xmath93 for @xmath90 and @xmath94 for @xmath92 .",
    "as time goes on , fluctuations of the population - based variance grow and so does the difference between the ensemble - based and population - based variance of wealth . in the synchronized regime ,",
    "the equivalence of the two quantities breaks entirely .",
    "the nature of the synchronized regime can be better understood by recalling the average wealth @xmath48 again .",
    "as explained above , its evolution is given by a sum of multiplicative processes , @xmath95 . despite this summation of contributions and their variable strengths",
    "( @xmath52 increases with time ) , according to the distribution of @xmath96 is approximately lognormal and , in agreement with our expectations , the variance @xmath97 $ ] is increasing . in the initial regime , this increase is due to growing variances of all agents wealth . in the power - law regime ,",
    "variances of wealth levels are approximately constant but their growing correlations lead to increasing @xmath97 $ ] . in the synchronized regime ,",
    "wealth correlations are already saturated and the growth of @xmath97 $ ] is caused by exponentially growing variances of wealths . since correlations are large , ensemble- and population - based quantities are no longer equivalent .",
    "finally we remark that since @xmath98 , @xmath21 is fixed , and @xmath50 $ ] grows without bounds , in the course of time it is increasingly probable that @xmath48 is much smaller than its expected value @xmath21 ; this can be interpreted as a high occurrence of temporal depressions of the economy .     at various times .",
    "parameter values are @xmath90 and @xmath87 , probabilities were obtained from @xmath86 independent realisations of the model . ]",
    "when @xmath38 , both @xmath43(t)$ ] and @xmath83 diverge and must be replaced by different quantities . instead of the variance , one can use the mean absolute deviation @xmath99 which avoids second moments of the wealth distribution and hence can be used for any @xmath100 .",
    "the pearson s correlation coefficient can be replaced by a rank correlation coefficient ( kendall s @xmath101 or spearman s @xmath102 ) .",
    "all three proposed quantities are hard to handle in analytical calculations and with strong noise , numerical simulations of the system are extremely time - demanding .",
    "while we have obtained no definite results yet , preliminary outcomes suggest that in this case too the transition from the power - law regime occurs at a time proportional to the number of agents @xmath0 .",
    "now we generalize the exchange network to an arbitrary graph : denoting the set of neighbours of agent @xmath8 by @xmath103 , the number of neighbours by @xmath104 , the average number of neighbours by @xmath105 .",
    "we assume that each agent interacts equally with all neighbours and per unit time exchanges the whole wealth , hence @xmath106 notice that the matrix of exchanges @xmath107 is asymmetric .",
    "now , generalizes to @xmath108 where @xmath109 . by averaging over realisations",
    "we obtain the set of equations for the stationary values of the average wealths @xmath110 which is solved by @xmath111 . assuming average wealth equal to @xmath112 , has the unique solution @xmath113 .",
    "this means that the topology of the exchange network is crucial for the distribution of wealth among the agents .",
    "consequently , when @xmath100 is small and hence wealth fluctuations are negligible , a power - law distribution of wealth can be purely a topological effect of a  scale - free degree distribution in the network of agent exchanges .",
    "to proceed , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are again the key quantities .",
    "they fulfill the equations @xmath114 which can be derived similarly to .",
    "we set the initial conditions according to the stationary wealths as @xmath115 and thus @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( the general case is studied in ) .",
    "from follows @xmath118 which means that the growth of @xmath43(t)$ ] precedes the growth of @xmath83 .",
    "this gives us a way to investigate the small time behaviour of : assuming @xmath53 constant , we obtain @xmath52 which in turn leads to an enhanced estimate of @xmath53 . for neighbouring agents @xmath8 and @xmath7 , the results are @xmath119&=\\frac{2\\sigma^2k_i^2}{z^2}\\,t+o(t^2),\\\\ \\label{genn - c - smallt } c_{ij}(t)&=\\frac{k_i+k_j}{2k_ik_j}\\,t+o(t^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover ,",
    "it can be shown that when the shortest path between agents @xmath8 and @xmath7 has the length @xmath120 , the leading term of @xmath83 is proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "these results are confirmed by where we investigate a system of ten agents who are placed on a ring ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) . as can be seen",
    ", numerical results agree well with @xmath83 proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "the system produces a  `` cascade '' of correlations : first only neighbouring agents are considerably correlated , then also agents with the distance two , distance three , and so forth .    .",
    "symbols show numerical results for neighbouring agents ( circles ) , agents with the distance 2 ( squares ) , and agents with the distance 3 ( diamonds ) , averaged over @xmath124 realisations .",
    "dashed lines have slopes 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . ]    for , the mean - field approximation yields the stationary distribution @xmath125v_i^{-2-\\lambda_i'}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 and the corresponding variance is @xmath43=k_i^2\\sigma^2/(z^2(1-\\sigma^2))$ ] . by comparing this stationary variance with , we obtain the transition time from the free regime to the power - law regime as @xmath127 which is identical to .",
    "further , from we see that the transition time from the power - law regime to the synchronized regime is proportional to @xmath128 and thus for the whole network it can be estimated as @xmath129 which is a generalization of .",
    "we see that for networks with a relatively small average degree , the power - law regime appears only for a limited time or not at all .",
    "we were unable to obtain an equivalent of the transition time @xmath78 for a  general network .",
    "considering , for example , a simple star - like structure with one agent in the center and the remaining @xmath130 agents connected only to him , one can see that the transition time @xmath131 is small and does not scale with @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that similarly to @xmath132 , @xmath131 is also of the order @xmath133 .",
    "this contradicts the findings presented in  @xcite ( page  541 ) where they report stationary power - law tails for @xmath134 ; it is possible that their numerical results are influenced by finite - time and finite - size effects .",
    "there is still one more transition time to investigate .",
    "when the initial conditions @xmath135 are not set in line with the stationary wealths given by eq .  , a certain time is needed to redistribute the excessive wealth levels over the network ; we say that the system is in the _",
    "equilibration regime_. since @xmath136 , noise terms do not contribute to the redistribution .",
    "thus , effectively simplifies to @xmath137 which leads to the exponential convergence of @xmath1 to the stationary value @xmath138 . by the substitution @xmath139 we obtain @xmath140",
    "whose time scale is given by the initial terms @xmath141 as @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the initial wealth distribution equilibrates in time @xmath142 .",
    "since the transition from the free regime occurs roughly at the same time , the system passes from the equilibration regime directly to the power - law regime .",
    "we have shown that in the investigated model , agent wealths have no stationary distribution and the power - law tailed distribution reported in previous works is only transient .",
    "in addition , for any finite number of agents , their average wealth @xmath96 follows a multiplicative process with a fixed expected value @xmath143 and an increasing variance @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "hence , as illustrated in , the probability @xmath144 approaches @xmath112 for any @xmath145 .",
    "we can conclude that the simple economy produced by the model is an uneasy one : the longer it evolves , the higher the probability that a given agent @xmath8 has wealth much smaller than any positive fraction of the expected wealth @xmath146 .",
    "there is also a more general lesson to be learned .",
    "in essence , the mean - field approximation here anchors the agent wealths to their expected values and thus weakens the diffusive nature of the studied stochastic system .",
    "mathematically speaking , the system behaviour depends on the order of limits @xmath26 and @xmath147 : in the former case there is a stationary wealth distribution , in the latter case there is none .",
    "this is an undesired consequence of the mean - field approximation which , as with other stochastic models , should be used with great caution . in particular , when using it , one should check if the nature of the studied system is not changed . to achieve this , in this paper",
    "we have used an aggregate quantity ( the average wealth ) and a quantity obtained using the mean - field approximation ( the wealth variance ) .    on the other hand , in some cases",
    "an anchoring term may be appropriate .",
    "for example , a  simple taxation of wealth can be achieved by introducing the term @xmath148 to , where @xmath149 represents the tax rate .",
    "then the set of equations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 has a nontrivial stationary solution for @xmath37 ; one can say that the proposed taxation stabilizes the system .",
    "notably , systems of coupled stochastic equations with multiplicative noise and negative feedback are common in the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "our work shows that this negative is crucial for mean - field studies of such systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the presented results , several questions remain open .",
    "first , for large time @xmath41 , the analytical form of the wealth distribution @xmath29 is unknown .",
    "second , for an arbitrary network of exchanges , the limiting value of the correlation @xmath83 and also the transition time @xmath131 are of interest .",
    "third , the strong noise case deserves more attention and perhaps an attempt for approximate analytical results . finally , the studied model is simplistic , since it combines two ingredients of economy  trade and speculation  in a  very unrealistic way .",
    "devising a more adequate model remains a  future challenge .",
