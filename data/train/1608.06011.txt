    "the description of these polytopes was recently given by a result of horvth and lngi in @xcite .",
    "the result for the real case will be a simple corollary .    working up to this , in section",
    "[ motivating example ] we look informally at @xmath19 unit vectors in @xmath20 there , we motivate a kind of geometric argument similar to the argument later used for @xmath0 unit vectors in @xmath16 it is a good idea to have this simple case in mind before going into the general complex case .    in section [ preliminaries ] , the pertinent definitions and facts to be used concerning euclidean geometry of arbitrary dimension are provided . in particular , we define simplices , explain some of their properties , and give the aforementioned result of horvth and lngi .",
    "next , in section [ main result section ] we prove the main result concerning @xmath0 unit vectors in @xmath16 the corollary for @xmath1 is then given .",
    "finally , in the last section we provide some motivation for studying the maximin determinants problem , give the solution for any @xmath14 unit vectors in @xmath21 and discuss further cases .",
    "the maximin determinants problem for @xmath14 unit vectors in @xmath22 is easy for arbitrary @xmath23 the general solution is given in section [ extras ]",
    ". however , there is some value in looking at the specific case of @xmath19 vectors in @xmath21 because we can develop a useful idea .",
    "this section is for motivating purposes and is not intended to be formal .",
    "let @xmath24 be a set of @xmath19 unit vectors in @xmath22 which form a triangle containing the origin when lines are drawn connecting the tips of the vectors .",
    "this triangle is inscribed in the unit circle , and might look as in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the triangle with vertices at @xmath25 and @xmath26 is partitioned into three smaller triangles , each with one vertex at the origin .",
    "hence , we can write the area of the larger triangle in terms of the sum of the areas of the smaller ones , which can be written in terms of determinants .",
    "@xmath27 let @xmath28 be a set of unit vectors with tips at the vertices of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the unit circle .",
    "such a triangle contains the origin and hence we can write its area as @xmath29 since the vectors in @xmath30 form an equilateral triangle , we have @xmath31 furthermore , it is a simple fact that the equilateral triangle has the greatest area of all triangles which can be inscribed in a circle , giving us @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 of course , this means @xmath34 it seems to then be the case that an optimal configuration for maximizing the minimum determinant could be when the three vectors point to the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "all that is left to check is what @xmath12 could be if @xmath25 and @xmath26 determine a triangle which does not contain the origin , like in figure [ figure2 ] .        in this case",
    ", we can not write the area of the triangle in terms of the sum of the absolute values of the determinants . however , we can try to cook up another set of @xmath19 unit vectors , call it @xmath35 such that the triangle formed by the vectors of @xmath36 contains the origin and @xmath37 in this situation , let @xmath38 the triangle formed by these vectors does contain the origin , so by the previous reasoning @xmath39 clearly @xmath40 so @xmath41    in conclusion , it seems like an optimal configuration is when the three vectors point to the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "of course this is not the only optimal configuration , since any transformation of these vectors which preserves the absolute values of the determinants will also be optimal ( for instance , multiplying some of the vectors by @xmath42 ) .",
    "let us summarize the few critical facts which made this argument work .",
    "firstly , when the triangle with vertices determined by @xmath11 contains the origin , we can express its area in terms of the sum of the absolute values of the determinants of @xmath43 secondly , there exists a set of unit vectors @xmath30 determining a triangle with largest area such that the origin is inside this triangle and the determinants of the vectors of @xmath30 are equal in magnitude .",
    "thirdly , if the triangle determined by @xmath11 does not contain the origin , then we can find another set @xmath36 so that its triangle does contain the origin and @xmath37    we will rely on generalized versions of these facts later .",

    "since the spherical code problem is unsolved and considered hard for most values of @xmath339 the maximin determinants problem in @xmath337 is probably also hard for most values of @xmath342      to solve the problem for @xmath0 unit vectors in @xmath2 we maximized the minimum of a certain set of determinants coming from @xmath17 unit vectors in @xmath343 this did not solve the maximin determinants problem for @xmath17 vectors in @xmath344 because we did not consider the minimum over all possible determinants of the @xmath17 vectors , and because we only considered special configurations of vectors coming from the @xmath0 vectors in @xmath16 so , there is still work to be done for the case of @xmath85 vectors in @xmath86    one strategy for values of @xmath345 is to attempt to generalize the methods used for @xmath14 vectors in @xmath20 as seen in subsection [ real2d ] , the optimal configuration of @xmath14 vectors in @xmath22 is @xmath14 consecutive vertices of a regular @xmath304-gon .",
    "we might then hope that in three dimensions the optimal @xmath14 vectors would come from some special polyhedron with @xmath346 vertices .",
    "we might also ask if the optimal @xmath14 vectors could be vertices of a polyhedron with @xmath346 vertices which either has maximal volume over all polyhedra with @xmath346 vertices inscribed in the unit sphere , or which solves the spherical code problem for @xmath346 points .",
    "considering @xmath354 again , the @xmath355 vectors which maximize volume and the @xmath355 vectors which solve the spherical code problem are known , and can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the configurations which answer each problem are not the same . in either case , however , one can compute the determinants and see that it is not possible to choose @xmath356 of the @xmath355 vectors so that the absolute values of the determinants are equal to those of the regular tetrahedron .",
