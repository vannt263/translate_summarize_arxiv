    "many systems seem to be well described by a non - extensive thermostatistic rather than the usual boltzmann - gibbs statistics ( bgs ) .",
    "when the effective microscopic interactions and microscopic memory are short - ranged and the boundary conditions are non-(multi)fractal @xcite , the bgs provides a complete and consistent description of the system . otherwise , it fails .",
    "an alternative approach is the use of the so - called tsallis statistics ( ts ) @xcite .",
    "the entropy in the ts is defined as @xcite    @xmath2    with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a given state with energy @xmath5 from @xmath6 possible states and @xmath7 is a positive constant .",
    "the index @xmath0 characterizes the degree of nonextensivity .",
    "the limiting case @xmath1 recovers the usual bgs entropy definition .",
    "the other contraints needed to obtain the thermodynamical averages have been recently discussed by tsallis , mendes and plastino @xcite .",
    "magnetic systems @xcite-@xcite are to be counted among the large variety of systems to which ts has already been applied @xcite .",
    "the reason for such an interest is obvious : statistical physicists have spent a lot of time in the past developing tools to understand the critical phenomena presented by this kind of systems - and have succeeded in this task . as a natural consequence , one could expect some attempts at generalizing well established approaches developed for extensive systems . the real space renormalization group @xcite and the mean field approximation@xcite are examples of tools that have been considered in these generalizations .",
    "however , it is not surprising that results from these approximations seem to be controversial : even fundamental questions such as how to define and to obtain the correct expression for the thermodynamical averages have been revisited very recently@xcite .    the monte carlo method is a powerful tool frequently used in the bgs framework in order to solve ambiguities of this sort .",
    "however , within the ts framework , monte carlo simulations of magnetic systems have not been exploited so far because of technical difficulties that we are going to address in this work .",
    "one issue is how to the define the acceptance probabilities which lead to the correct distribution of probabilities .",
    "a first alternative was presented in the application of the generalized simulated annealing for the traveling salesman problem@xcite , where the acceptance probability is a simple generalization of the metropolis algorithm for @xmath8 .",
    "this alternative was motivated by the definition of the thermodynamical averages in use at that time , which imposed an undesirable dependence on the definition of the zero of the energy scale .",
    "the use of the above mentioned alternative for the acceptance probabilities conveniently removes this dependence .",
    "a second alternative was proposed by andricioaei and straub ( as ) @xcite a couple of years after the first one .",
    "a new expression for the acceptance probabilities was obtained from the detailed balance condition ( a sufficient but not necessary condition for thermodynamical equilibrium ) .",
    "this new alternative cleverly circumvents the ambiguity on the definition of the lowest level of energy .",
    "the second reason why , in our opinion , monte carlo simulations are not frequently used within the ts is the fact that all the computational effort involved in a bgs simulation has to be spent again for each value of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 is a continuous variable , computer simulations are much more time - consuming in the ts than in the bgs , if one wants to investigate the @xmath0 dependence of the results .",
    "that is why it has been difficult , for instance , to answer the question about which acceptance probabilities to use in a monte carlo simulation of magnetic systems .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is to show that the recently proposed broad histogram method ( bhm ) @xcite is the ideal tool for monte carlo simulations within the ts framework . because the @xmath0-independent density of states @xmath9 is , in the bhm ,",
    "directly obtained from some measured microscopic quantities , we are able to obtain any thermodynamic observable for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath10 from only one computer run .",
    "this fact turns bhm simulations on the ts , _ for all values of @xmath0 _ , as fast as in the bgs .",
    "briefly , in this paper we are suggesting the bhm as the ideal tool for computer studies on the ts .",
    "we show it through a simulation of the two - dimensional ising model with short - range interactions .",
    "we are aware of the fact that the model we are going to study is an extensive one , therefore well described by the bgs . among the reasons why we decided to study",
    "this system are :    * this model can be very easily simulated with great efficiency ; * the exact solution for the density of states of finite systems is known in the limit @xmath1 @xcite ; moreover , the bhm is able to reproduce this exact solution with great accuracy @xcite ; * previous results for this model using other approximation methods are controversial and/or inconclusive ; our simulations could shed some light on this ongoing discussion ; * we could easily and reliably show which choice for the acceptance probabilities reproduces the tsallis distribution of statistical weights @xcite ; * this simple system is here used as a testing ground for the methods we propose ; building on this first step allows us to use the same approach to study , other more complex non - extensive systems such as the ising model with long - range interactions .    in summary ,",
    "our choice of a well known system is most convenient since we are dealing with two brand - new recipes : the ts with normalized q - expectation values and the bhm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we review the ts with normalized q - expectation values .",
    "we also include a discussion about the stability of the solutions for the free energy in this new formalism . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the broad histogram monte carlo method and present its implementation for the ts .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of our results and conclusions .",
    "tsallis , mendes and plastino @xcite have recently discussed the role of constraints within ts . in that work , they study three different alternatives for the internal energy constraint .",
    "the first two choices correspond to the ones which have been applied to many different systems in the last years @xcite .",
    "they are : ( ia ) @xmath11 and ( ib ) @xmath12 . however , both constraints present difficulties .",
    "a third choice for the internal energy constraint is defined as @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath0 is the degree of non - extensivity , also present in the definition of entropy ( eq .",
    "each constraint ( ia),(ib ) and eq.([constrain ] ) determines a different set of probabilities @xmath14 for each state with energy @xmath5 .",
    "the extremization of the generalized entropy ( [ sq ] ) , under constraint ( [ constrain ] ) gives us an implicit equation for the probabilities @xmath14 :    @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}/z_q\\label{piq}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath16^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ]    the normalized q - expectation value of an observable is therefore defined as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is any observable which commutes with the hamiltonian - otherwise we should make use of the density operator @xmath19 .",
    "we will refer to this reformulation of the ts as `` with normalized q - expectation values '' .",
    "a very important consequence of this new definition of constraints is that the probabilities do not depend on the choice of the zero of energy .    in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ piq ] ) tsallis _ et al .",
    "_ suggest two different approaches , namely the _ iterative procedure _ and the _ @xmath20 transformation_. in the iterative procedure , we start with an initial set of probabilities and iterate them self - consistently until the desirable precision is reached . in the @xmath21 transformation the set of equations above is transformed to :    @xmath22^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}/z'_{q } \\\\\\ ] ]    @xmath23^ { \\frac{1}{1-q}}}\\\\\\ ] ]    with    @xmath24    this set of equations is similar to the one that is obtained using constraint ( ib ) , except for its dependency on the renormalized temperature , given by eq .",
    "( [ betabetaast ] ) .    in order to obtain @xmath25",
    ", we go through the following steps :    1 .",
    "compute the quantities @xmath26 ; 2 .   if @xmath27 them @xmath28 ;",
    "compute @xmath29 ; 4 .",
    "compute @xmath30 ; 5 .   obtain @xmath31 and any other thermodynamical quantity using eq .",
    "( 5 ) ; 6 .",
    "obtain @xmath32 from equation ( [ betabetaast ] ) .",
    "this recipe allows the determination of @xmath33 for all @xmath32 and consequently @xmath34 ( and any other observable ) .",
    "the second step in the above procedure is the well known cutoff @xcite associated to _",
    "`` vanishing probabilities''_. this cutoff is required only for @xmath35 . because the cutoff is applied before the actual computation of the probabilities",
    ", the norm constraint is still respected .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that both recipes , the iterative method and @xmath36 transformation , demand a careful analysis before its application .",
    "the free energy obtained from the iterative procedure presents a non - physical discontinuity whereas the free energy from the @xmath37 transformation has loops .",
    "to get rid of these pathologies , one has to make explicit use of the minimization condition on the free energy , whenever an ambiguity appears .",
    "this procedure generates the correct internal energy and temperature dependency and restores the proper behaviour of the thermodynamic observables .",
    "following the suggestion of ref.@xcite , we use in this paper the @xmath37 transformation with the proper corrections .",
    "the approach that we are going to discuss in this section , the broad histogram method ( bhm ) @xcite-@xcite , is one of the many attempts at doing very efficient simulations . in traditional simulations ,",
    "we need a new run for each value of the temperature .",
    "however , some different approaches have been proposed in which we compute some quantities at a given temperature and reweight them for a different temperature ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of these approaches is the histogram method , first introduced by salzburg @xcite and popularized by ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the histogram method presents some limitations , the most important concerning the range of temperatures for which just one run is sufficient .",
    "the bhm enables us to directly calculate the energy spectrum @xmath9 , without any need for a particular choice of the thermostatistics to be used @xcite-@xcite .    in the bhm",
    "the energy degeneracy is calculated through the steps :    _ step 1 _ : choice of a micro reversible protocol of allowed movements in the state space of the system such that changing from an @xmath38 to an @xmath39 configuration is allowed if , and only if , the reverse change is also allowed ( the protocol must be micro - reversible ) :    @xmath40    it is important to note that these movements are virtual , since they are not actually performed .",
    "_ step 2 _ : choice of a fixed amount of energy change @xmath41 and computation of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for the configuration x , defined as the number of allowed movements that would increase ( decrease ) the energy of the configuration by @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the micro canonical average of @xmath46 ( @xmath43 ) at energy @xmath47 ;    _ step 3 _ : since the total number of possible movements from level @xmath48 to level @xmath47 is equal to the total number of possible movements from level @xmath47 to level @xmath49 , we can write down the equation    @xmath50    this relation is exact for any statistical model or any energy spectrum @xcite . it can be rewritten as    @xmath51    if we choose @xmath52 , the above equation can be approximated by    @xmath53    this equation can be easily solved for @xmath9 .",
    "once this quantity is known , the expected value of some observable @xmath18 can be calculated by    @xmath54^q}}{\\sum_e g(e ) [ p(e)]^q}\\ ] ]    this method ( in the q=1 bgs ) was first applied to systems with discrete degrees of freedom . recently it has been extended to continuous systems , such as the xy model @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the first time the method is being applied to a different statistics . besides the more accurate and faster results in comparison to traditional methods ,",
    "the bhm is even more efficient in this particular case because eq .",
    "( 13 ) is the only quantity to be recalculated for each new value of @xmath0 .",
    "to clarify the application of our ideas to magnetic systems , we will use the square lattice ferromagnetic ising model with first neighbour interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is given by    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 is a positive constant .",
    "the sum is performed over all pairs of first neighbours in a square lattice of size @xmath58 . for an efficient implementation , we rewrite the hamiltonian as    @xmath59    where @xmath60 or @xmath61 and @xmath62 represents the exclusive or operation , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the critical temperature for @xmath1 in the thermodynamical limit for this renormalized hamiltonian is @xmath65}^{-1}=1.13459 ... $ ] .",
    "we choose a single spin flip protocol of movements to obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as proposed in @xcite and @xcite , an unbiased random walk is them performed on the energy axis in order to visit all values on the energy spectrum .",
    "the number @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) of movements that increase ( decrease ) the current value of energy @xmath47 by @xmath41 is used to calculate @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath70 is also stored for each lattice size . here",
    "we choose @xmath71 out of the possible values @xmath72=@xmath73 .",
    "the histogram is obtained from 6.400.000 samples ( distributed in the energy axis ) for l=30,50,70,100 .",
    "obtaining the histograms for @xmath74 takes 20 minutes of cpu time on a dec alpha 400 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the time increases to 220 minutes .",
    "the next step is to obtain the set of probabilities using the @xmath76 procedure . after this step",
    ", we can use eq .",
    "( [ qexpectation ] ) to obtain the internal energy @xmath77 and the magnetization @xmath78 .",
    "the free energy @xmath79 is also calculated using    @xmath80    instead of using eq .",
    "( 4 ) , it is more efficient to use the relation @xcite    @xmath81^q}\\ ] ]    the cpu time for the determination of the values of any observable in the whole range of temperatures is independent of the lattice size .",
    "typically , it takes 30s on a dec alpha 400 for 20000 values of temperature , for each value of q.    for the sake of comparison , we have implemented multispin @xcite versions of the ising model with the as acceptance probability @xcite    @xmath82\\ ] ]    where @xmath83\\ln [ 1-(1-q)\\beta ' e]$ ] , and with the tsp acceptance probability @xcite    @xmath84    notice that the equations above are written as functions of @xmath85 instead of @xmath86 .",
    "the reason is that they were proposed before the publication of the solution for the constraints problem in the ts @xcite discussed in section 2 .    for an @xmath74 lattice , a simulation run , using the traditional method with the same numer of monte carlo steps as used in the bhm simulation , took 60s of cpu time * for a single pair of values @xmath87*. this",
    "should be compared to the 1200s of bhm for all values of q and the whole range of temperatures .",
    "we will now discuss the results obtained from the implementation described in the previous section .",
    "we begin with a comparison between the results obtained through the use of the two already mentioned techniques : the bhm and the traditional multispin simulation with both the as and the tsp probabilities .",
    "the comparison must be made in terms of @xmath88 , because the as and tsp probabilities were derived before the publication of ref .",
    "@xcite , as pointed above . in fig .",
    "1 we show the results for the magnetization and the internal energy as functions of @xmath88 .    the remarkable agreement between the results coming from both the bhm and the as techniques contrast with those coming from the tsp probabilities .",
    "therefore , this last one should be discarded as an approach to the simulation of physical systems in the ts framework . in fig .",
    "1 the values for @xmath0 were chosen to be close to one .",
    "we are going to discuss separately the @xmath35 and @xmath89 regimes , since the system behaves differently in these regions .",
    "2 shows the internal energy as a function of @xmath10 , for some values of @xmath0 very close to one .",
    "the first surprising result is that a reentrant region develops as soon as @xmath0 gets smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "this reentrant behaviour is even more noticeable as the lattice size increases , for the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour is already being reported @xcite for a two - level system .",
    "we are going to use the same recipe proposed therein to deal with this pathology .",
    "the reentrant behaviour is also present in the free energy curve , as we can see in fig .",
    "3 . to reconstruct the correct curve for the free energy and , as a consequence , for any thermodynamical macroscopic quantity",
    ", we have to choose a criterion to discard two of the three possible states in the loop ( see the inset of fig.3 ) .",
    "we choose to consider only the state that corresponds to the lowest value of the free energy .",
    "the correct curve for the internal energy is also displayed in fig.3 , and is another illustration that supports the statement that ts with renormalized q - expectation values is thermodinamically stable .",
    "a deeper discussion of the reentrant behaviour and the technique developed to restore uniqueness is being published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "when uniqueness is restored by removing the loop , there results a free energy with a discontinuous first derivative with respect to temperature at a point which could be identified as the transition temperature .",
    "this means that the entropy has a discontinuity at this temperature .",
    "in addition , the magnetization , as shown in fig . 4 , also presents a discontinuity at this point - after the reentrancies have been removed .",
    "these discontinuities become more noticeable as we consider ever smaller values of @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) and/or bigger lattices ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "all these results were obtained for finite lattices . to determine the transition temperature in the thermodynamic limit @xmath90",
    ", we plot the transition temperature for finite lattices as a function of its inverse size , @xmath91 , and take the limit @xmath92 .",
    "6 shows an attempt of finite - size scaling for different values of @xmath0 . for @xmath35 and @xmath93 ,",
    "the critical temperature vanishes extremely fast .",
    "our results point out that there is no phase transition for @xmath35 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "basically , the same approach we have used for @xmath35 is also used here .",
    "however , we have found that the 2d ising model presents a quite different behaviour in both regimes ( actually , it is also different from the @xmath1 case ) .",
    "7 shows the internal energy and magnetization as functions of @xmath10 for some values of @xmath0 on a @xmath94 lattice . from the internal energy curve",
    ", we promptly find that the discontinuity in its derivative ( specific heat ) at @xmath95 is not present anymore , therefore there are no evidence of a phase transition .",
    "this is also clear from the behaviour of the magnetization as a function of temperature .",
    "fig . 8 supports this conclusion ; the magnetization gets smoother with increasing values of @xmath0 or the lattice size .    a careful examination of fig .",
    "7 and fig .",
    "8 reveals discontinuous changes in the derivative of the curves at two points ( these changes are more easily seen for the largest values of @xmath0 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "these discontinuous derivatives are related to the transformation @xmath97 . fig .",
    "9 presents the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath88 for the same values of @xmath96 used in fig .",
    "8 and for a range of values of @xmath0 slightly larger than what was used in fig",
    "the curves display a region of abrupt change ( but not a discontinuity ) which gets larger as @xmath0 is increased , for a fixed @xmath96 .",
    "the values of t that limit this region are also those that lead to a discontinuous specific heat , and appear to have zero and @xmath98 as limits when @xmath0 or @xmath96 increase . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the magnetization is always positive ( therefore , the system is always in the ordered state , except at the limit of infinite temperature ) and the derivative of the specific heat is always positive .",
    "therefore , we argue that there is no phase transition for the 2d ising model , for @xmath89 .",
    "we studied the simulation of magnetic systems in the tsallis statistics using the broad histogram method .",
    "it was shown that this method is very efficient , since all thermodynamic observables of interest can be calculated for a new value of the parameter @xmath0 without the need for a new computer run . the square lattice ising model with nearest neighbour interactions was chosen as an example to test the method . all previous work on the nearest neighbour ising model suggest that there is a phase transition for each value of @xmath99 .",
    "however , our results show that there is no transition in this model for any value of @xmath99 .",
    "only the @xmath1 system presents the usual second order phase transition .",
    "further step along these lines would be the simulation of spin models with long - range interactions .",
    "we believe that these intrinsically non - extensive systems can display a richer behaviour , within the tsallis statistics framework , than the model studied in this work .",
    "actually , previous studies of magnetic systems in the tsallis statistics have already suggest that this is the case .",
    "however , a powerful simulational tool such as the broad histogram monte carlo method used in this work was lacking and only recently has become available .",
    "the demonstration that we now present of its usefulness will surely bring considerable advance in the understanding of the behaviour of magnetic systems in a non - extensive regime .",
    "the authors are indebted to professor c. tsallis for extensive ( @xmath1 ! ) and enlightening discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by cnpq and capes ( brazilian agencies ) ."
