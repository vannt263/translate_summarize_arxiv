    "this anomaly can be attributed to a very small amount of ferromagnetic ce@xmath104pd@xmath105 @xcite , which is not even detected in @xmath83 nor in @xmath10 measurements .",

    "the strong local character of the `` @xmath111 '' orbital , as a well defined trivalent ce atom , is concomitant with the irrelevant hybribization ( or kondo ) effect on ground ( gs ) and cf excited states .",
    "within such a scenario , a f- ground state is usually expected for ce compounds @xcite . knowing that the twin compound ce@xmath112pd@xmath17in@xmath21 modifies its magnetic structure with a slight variation of composition @xcite , one should ask whether the intermediate phase is an exotic phase appearing under this special situation of competing exchange interactions .",
    "thus , the formation of such a phase previous to the stabilization of the f - gs rises the question about the role of the atomic configuration in this peculiar crystalline structure together with the consequent steric distribution of magnetic interactions .",

    "@xmath131 connecting ce atoms with those of the upper and lower plane is not relevant in this range of temperature .",
    "+ although this compound shows its upper magnetic transition at @xmath132 , the presence of magnetic correlations is observed at much higher temperatures in the tail of @xmath133 and the increase of @xmath134 .",
    "these signs of incipient magnetic correlations within the paramagnetic phase contains important information about the nature of the transition itself since they contain the contribution of related precursors .",
    "furthermore , strongly anisotropic or low dimensional systems display a significant amount of entropy above the transition .",
    "the existence of such a correlated paramagnetic region in the compound under study is confirmed by the fact that it has to be heated at least up to @xmath135k for a zfc process , otherwise traces of remand magnetic contributions are detected afterwards .",
    "a deeper analysis of @xmath92 shows that the temperature dependence at @xmath136 is @xmath137 , in coincidence with the specific heat of cocs@xmath104br@xmath105 @xcite ( see fig.6a ) , which is an archetype for a quadratic spin @xmath138 square lattice .",
    "notice that not only the temperature dependence coincides but also their respective absolute values , provided that for ce@xmath35pd@xmath35sn @xmath139 is taken in `` mol '' units ( i.e. 2 ce atoms ) .",
    "notice that the transition temperature of the model compound is scaled to compound under study .",
    "the jump of the specific heat also points in that direction , since in mean field theory the jump of the specific heat at a magnetic transition is given by : @xmath140/[(2\\mathbb{s}_{eff}+1)^2 + 1]$ ] @xcite , which for @xmath141 is @xmath142r , whilst for @xmath138 it becomes @xmath143r like the measured value .",
    "the magnetic entropy , computed as @xmath144 , reaches the expected value @xmath145 for a doublet ground state at around 15k ( the pre - factor 2 corresponds to two magnetic atoms per formula unit ) . as depicted in fig.5b , the entropy gain reaches @xmath146 of that value at @xmath147k .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the low value of @xmath148k , which can be evaluated from @xmath149 by applying the desgranges - schotte @xcite criterion of @xmath150 for a non - ordered system .    the facts that , in the comparison with cocs@xmath104br@xmath105 , the @xmath92 of ce@xmath35pd@xmath35sn has to be computed as `` per mol '' ( i.e. = 2ce at . ) and that the reference compound has an effective spin @xmath138 , provide the keys to understand the physics of our compound .",
    "they suggest the formation of magnetic dimers built up through the @xmath151 interaction . since the @xmath138 momentum has three quantum projections , the measured entropy has to increase accordingly .",
    "in fact , the 80% of @xmath145 ( per ce at . )",
    "collected up to @xmath152 corresponds to @xmath153 ( i.e per mol ) , as depicted on the right axis of fig.5b .",
    "the 20% of the remanent value is related to the entropy relaxed in the @xmath133 tail which arises from the difference between : @xmath154 .",
    "the consequent structural loci of those dimers in a square lattice is sketched in fig.4a , where the @xmath138 moments are depicted in the center of the @xmath155 spacing as @xmath156 .",
    "this structural configuration of dimers is topologically equivalent to the shastry - sutherland systems @xcite proposed for af dimers and inter - dimer interactions , i.e. af @xmath151 and @xmath157 .",
    "as it was pointed out by theoretical calculations @xcite such combination of interaction can lead to a stable af - gs , recently realized in yb@xmath35pt@xmath35pb single crystals @xcite , which undergoes a slight shift of pt atoms that results in two kinds of yb - pt tetrahedra .    comparing these yb and ce isotypic compounds , we can remark the heavy fermion character of yb@xmath35pt@xmath35pb , with @xmath158mj / mol k@xmath159 @xcite , whereas the ce one shows a record low value of @xmath160mj / mol k@xmath159 .",

    "the extended tails above their respective upper transitions become significant at about three times @xmath30 ( @xmath29 ) . at lower temperatures ,",
    "they show an anomaly at nearly one half of the upper transition .",
    "noteworthy is the fact that , while in yb@xmath35pt@xmath35pb it looks like a shoulder ( see fig.5b in @xcite ) , it is a first order transition in ce@xmath35pd@xmath35sn .",
    "since in the compound under study @xmath151 is ferromagnetic , and that situation was not proved theoretically to become a stable gs , our magnetic scenario seems to be non trivial or perhaps even meta - stable .",
    "furthermore , taking into account the modulated character of the intermediate phase , an af interaction between dimers ( i.e. @xmath157 in fig.5c ) can be expected .",
    "particularly , in the case of ce@xmath35pd@xmath35sn , the low temperature magnetic properties suggest that the proposed ce - ce magnetic dimerization arises once @xmath166 becomes @xmath167 ( at @xmath168k as suggested in fig.6a ) when the paramagnetic degrees of freedom of the doublet gs start to condense .",
    "coincidentally , the straight line extrapolating @xmath169 to @xmath9k is well defined up to that temperature .",
    "however , when those dimers start to interact af to each other via @xmath170 ( as expected from the cusp of @xmath45 at @xmath29 ) , the long range order parameter can not stabilize in a simple manner .",
    "notice that only the couplings between @xmath114 dimers is depicted in fig.5c for simplicity , whilst the hamiltonian proposed in ref.@xcite involves a set of next-@xmath114 couplings .",
    "this apparent intrinsic instability of the intermediate phase ( probably originated in frustration effects ) ends at the lower transition @xmath171k , where a 3d f - gs takes over .",
    "these experimental results confirm ce@xmath35pd@xmath35sn as one of the scars examples of ferromagnetic ground state among ce intermetallic , with very stable magnetic moments and practically no traces of kondo effect in the ground and excited cf states .    at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath74k )",
    "magnetic interactions develop with an excitation spectrum mimetizing a quasi-2d square lattice @xmath138 model .",
    "this property , the entropy value at @xmath29 [ @xmath172 and the structural morphology suggest the progressive formation of ce - ce ferromagnetic dimers within a pattern resembling that proposed by shastry - sutherland . the f character of @xmath151 is recognized from the positive value of @xmath28 and the entropy related to a three fold degenerate state ,",
    "whereas the af character of the exchange @xmath170 between dimers explains the cusp of @xmath45 at @xmath7k . nevertheless , this interaction is not able to stabilize the intermediate phase ( @xmath93 ) leading the system to another phase transition .",
    "the comparison with isotypic yb@xmath35pt@xmath35pb and model predictions suggest that no stable gs is reached in a combination of f - dimers ( @xmath151 ) and af exchange ( @xmath170 ) among them , at least in this intermetallic compound .",
    "nevertheless , an exotic phase with a non trivial order parameter compete in energy within a short range of temperature till the 3d f - gs takes over . at the curie temperature @xmath173k a first order transition is observed in @xmath83 , @xmath10 and @xmath2 , including hysteretic features .",
