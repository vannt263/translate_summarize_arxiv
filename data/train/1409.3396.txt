    "1d kitaev s toy model is one of the simplest but the most representative model for majorana mode @xcite .",

    "@xmath57 is a non - local ordinary fermion .",
    "the degenerate states can be used for topological quantum memory qubits that are immune to local errors .",
    "now let us construct the `` superconducting '' chain based on the solution @xmath15 of ybe .",
    "we imagine that a unitary evolution is governed by @xmath15 .",
    "if only @xmath27 in unitary operator @xmath15 is time - dependent , we can express a state @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "taking the schrdinger equation @xmath60 into account , one obtains : @xmath61=\\hat{h}(t)\\breve{r}_i|\\psi(0)\\rangle.\\ ] ] then the hamiltonian @xmath62 related to the unitary operator @xmath15 is obtained : @xmath63 substituting @xmath64 into equation ( [ schrodingerequation ] ) , we have : @xmath65 this hamiltonian describes the interaction between @xmath66-th and @xmath67-th sites with the parameter @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath69 , the unitary evolution corresponds to the braiding progress of two nearest majorana fermion sites in the system , here n is an integer and signifies the times of braiding operation .",
    "if we only consider the nearest - neighbour interactions between mfs and extend equation ( [ 2mfhamiltonian ] ) to an inhomogeneous chain with 2n sites , the derived `` superconducting '' chain model is expressed as : @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 describing odd - even and even - odd pairs , respectively .",

    ", this hamiltonian corresponds to the trivial case of kitaev s . in fig.[figure1 ] , this hamiltonian is described by the intersecting lines above the dashed line , where the intersecting lines correspond to interactions .",

    "thus we conclude that our hamiltonian derived from @xmath100 corresponding to the braiding of nearest majorana fermion sites is exactly the same as the 1d wire proposed by kitaev , and @xmath101 corresponds to the phase transition point in the `` superconducting '' chain . by choosing different time - dependent parameter @xmath32 and @xmath33",
