    "when a weak structural element in a material with stochastically distributed strengths fails , the increased load on the remaining elements may cause further ruptures , and thus induce a burst avalanche of a certain size @xmath1 , i.e.  one in which @xmath1 elements fail simultaneously .",
    "when the load is further increased , new avalanches occur . the distribution of avalanche sizes , either at a fixed load , or the cumulative distribution from zero load until complete break - down of the material , depends on several factors , in particular the threshold strength distribution and the mechanism for load sharing between the elements .    due to the complex interplay of failures and redistributions of local stresses ,",
    "few analytical results are available in this field ; computer simulations are commonly applied  see herrmann and roux @xcite for a review . however , firm analytical results , albeit on simplified models , are important in order to develop a deeper understanding for universal properties and general trends . in the present article",
    "we therefore review and study burst events in models of fibrous materials that are sufficient simple to allow theoretical treatment .",
    "the models we consider are bundles of @xmath3 parallel fibers , clamped at both ends , and stretched by a force @xmath4 ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the individual fibers in the bundle are assumed to have strength thresholds @xmath5 , @xmath6 , which are independent random variables with the same cumulative distribution function @xmath7 and corresponding density function @xmath8 : @xmath9 whenever a fiber experiences a force equal to or greater than its strength threshold , it breaks immediately and does not contribute to the strength of the bundle thereafter .",
    "the models differ , apart from differences in the threshold distribution , in how stress is redistributed on the surviving fibers when a fiber fails .    a central quantity to be studied in the following",
    "is the expected number @xmath10 of bursts of size @xmath1 when the fiber bundle is stretched until complete breakdown .",
    "the model of this kind with the longest history @xcite is one in which it is assumed that the fibers obey hookean elasticity right up to the breaking point , and that the load distributes itself equally among the surviving fibers .",
    "the model with this democratic load redistribution is similar to mean - field models in statistical physics , and is called here the _",
    "global model_. for large @xmath3 daniels @xcite was able to determine the asymptotic distribution for the bundle strength , a result that been refined later @xcite .",
    "the distribution of burst avalanches was first studied by hemmer and hansen @xcite .",
    "their main result was that for a large class of threshold distributions @xmath7 the bursts were distributed according to an asymptotic power law , @xmath11 with a universal exponent @xmath12 in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we show that for special threshold distributions the power law ( [ 2 ] ) is not obeyed .",
    "the assumption of global load - sharing among surviving fibers is often unrealistic , and it is natural to consider models in which the extra stresses by a fiber rupture are taken up by the fibers in the immediate vicinity . the extreme version is to assume that only the _ nearest - neighbor _ surviving fibers take part in the load - sharing . in a one - dimensional geometry , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , presicely two fibers , one on each side , share the extra stress .",
    "when the strength thresholds take only two values , the bundle strength distribution has been found analytically @xcite .",
    "one interesting result is that the average bundle strength has a logarithmic size effect .",
    "the distribution of burst avalanches for such models with local load - sharing has not yet been determined , but simulations @xcite show that this model is _ not _ in the same universality class as the global model . the challenge to determine the burst distribution by other means than simulations remains , and",
    "that this is possible , at least in a special case ( sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) , is one of the main results of the present article .",
    "in the global model the total force on a fiber bundle is distributed evenly on the surviving fibers . with a given load @xmath13 per fiber , all fibers with threshold less than @xmath13 have failed , while fibers with thresholds above @xmath13 survives . for large @xmath3 the average number of fibers with thresholds exceeding the value",

    "assume that an infinitesimal increase in the external force results in a break of a fiber with threshold @xmath13 .",

    "the probability that precisely @xmath26 fibers break as a consequence of the first failure is given by a poisson distribution with this average , i.e.  it equals @xmath27 this is not sufficient , however .",
    "we must ensure that the thresholds for these @xmath26 fibers are not so high that the avalanche stops underway .",
    "this requires that at least @xmath28 of the thresholds are in the interval @xmath29 , for @xmath30 . in other words , if we consider the @xmath1 intervals @xmath31 , @xmath32 ,  , @xmath33 , we must find at most @xmath34 thresholds in the @xmath28 last intervals .",

    "summing over the possible values of @xmath43 , we obtain the probability that the avalanche can not have started with the failure of a fiber with any of the @xmath46 nearest - neighbor threshold values below @xmath13 : @xmath50 finally we take the limit @xmath51 , for which the last term vanishes . for @xmath52",
    "the sum must vanish since the left - hand side of ( [ pb ] ) is non - negative , while the factor @xmath53 is negative .",

    "a weak region in the bundle may be responsible for the failure of the whole bundle . for a large number @xmath3 of fibers",
    "the probability of a weak region somewhere is high , and this explains in a qualitative way that the maximum load the bundle are able to carry does not increase proportional to @xmath3 , but slower than linear .",
    "the load distribution rule ( [ hp ] ) implies that an avalanche of size @xmath1 does necessarily lead to a complete breakdown of the whole bundle if the external force is too high , i.e. , if @xmath20 exceeds a critical value @xmath123 . since here",
    "a fiber can at most take a load of unity , we have @xmath124    the strategy of the derivation is to first establish a set of recursion relations between quantities that give probabilities of certain configurations at fixed external force , i.e. , at fixed @xmath20 . afterwards ( sec .  [ sec3b ] ) we connect this with the size distribution of avalanches for all @xmath20 up to the critical value @xmath125 .",
    "we will use the terminology that the _ magnitude _ of an avalanche is the number of failing fibers in the avalanche , and the _ length _ of an avalanche is the number of fibers between the nearest surviving fibers on each side of the avalanche .",
    "the length can be larger than the magnitude since it may include fibers that have failed in previous avalanches .",
    "we define @xmath126 , the _ gap probability _ , to be the probability ( at given force parameter @xmath20 ) that in a selected region of @xmath127 consecutive fibers all fibers have failed , assuming the two fibers on each side to be intact .",

    "the force on the fiber just before it fails is @xmath138 , and for the uniform distribution the probability that it fails due to a force parameter increase @xmath139 is just @xmath140 . the probability of the burst of magnitude @xmath141 to occur when @xmath142 is this probability of failure of the single remaining fiber , @xmath140 , times the probability that the @xmath137 neighbors have already failed .",
    "the latter is given by the appropriate gap probabilities .",
    "since the position of the failing fiber is arbitrary in the interval we have @xmath143    we next consider expressions for the probability @xmath136 with an internal avalanche of magnitude @xmath87 larger than unity . for that purpose",
    "we introduce two new quantities : let @xmath144 be the probability that a fiber fails because a force parameter increase @xmath145 starts , on its right - hand side , an avalanche of magnitude @xmath87 ( not counting the ultimate fiber on the left - hand side ) and of length @xmath132 . similarly @xmath146 is the probability that a fiber fails because the force parameter increase @xmath145 starts , on its left - hand side , an avalanche of magnitude @xmath87 and of length @xmath132 .",
    "consider the event described by @xmath136 , and let the last of the @xmath87 fibers that fail be fiber @xmath147 .",

    "the internal avalanche started by @xmath145 proceeds so that the final failure is either the leftmost or the rightmost of the @xmath87 fibers , or both .",
    "if both go simultaneously , we make the arbitrary definition that in such a case the right - hand neighbor fails first .",
