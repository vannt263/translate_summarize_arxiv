    "the potential of gravitational lenses to increase our knowledge concerning the amount and nature of dark matter , constrain key cosmological parameters and offer uniquely detailed views of faint distant objects is well known ( blandford and narayan 1992 ) .",
    "the development over the last decade of the field of `` weak lensing '' in which statistical studies of many sources , only slightly perturbed by the effects of lensing , are made has produced important new results concerning the distribution of mass in galaxy clusters and very large scale structures .",
    "however , the assembly of examples of systems multiply imaged by individual galaxies has proved extremely hard .",
    "searches for individual examples of strong lensing have relied on the examination of a sample of objects , such as quasars or flat  spectrum radio  sources , where a large fraction of the sample lie at high redshift .",
    "thus , towards each object there is a significant path ",
    "length over which an intervening deflector may interpose itself close to the line  of  sight .",
    "the lens search proceeds through the identification of sources whose morphology , multiple images or extended arcs for example , is consistent with the effects of lensing .",
    "further imaging , at different wavelengths , and spectroscopy is then necessary to establish the source as a bona  fide lens and to obtain redshifts for the source and the deflecting galaxy . in practice ,",
    "obtaining the redshifts is very difficult , particularly for radio  selected objects , and in the compilation of kochanek et al ( 1999 : _ http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles_ ) only 19 of the 45 lensed systems possess both deflector and source redshifts .    an alternative search strategy is to examine optimal lines  of  sight by identifying a population of very effective deflectors , where it is known that any source lying behind the deflector will be significantly lensed , and then to examine the spectra of the deflectors for evidence of lensed background sources .",
    "escud and lehr ( 1992 ) pointed out that provided the surface density of faint , small , galaxies at high redshift is large , significant numbers of galaxy  galaxy lenses should exist .",
    "subsequent observational developments have shown that the surface density of high  redshift , star  forming objects is indeed large ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1996 , hu , cowie and mcmahon 1998 ) . provided a suitable sample of deflectors can be identified the optimal line  of  sight search strategy offers significant advantages , including i ) high efficiency , the probability a lens will be seen along a line  of  sight is significant , ii ) the deflector and source redshifts may be readily acquired , allowing the full lensing geometry to be defined , iii ) the small , but extended , star ",
    "forming objects lead to resolved gravitational lenses , not unlike the radio  rings arising from morphologically extended radio emission , which provide much greater constraints on the deflector masses than the more familiar two or four  image lenses of unresolved quasars .    using apm measures of united kingdom schmidt telescope @xmath1 plates it is possible to identify the ideal population of deflectors ",
    "massive , bulge  dominated , galaxies at redshift @xmath0 , essentially half - way between ourselves and any high redshift source . specifically , locating the population of relatively bright , @xmath2 , red , @xmath3 , galaxies with redshifts @xmath4 is straightforward ( warren et al .",
    "the galaxy population has a surface density of @xmath5deg@xmath6 and associated with each galaxy there is an area of sky , @xmath7arcsec@xmath8 , in which any distant source will be multiply imaged , with an associated increase in brightness of a factor @xmath9 .",
    "these early  type galaxies represent essentially optimal lines  of  sight to search for examples of strong lensing .",
    "the presence of a lens is revealed by the detection of an anomalous emission line in the spectrum of one of the target distant early - type galaxies , so obtaining spectra of a large sample of the deflector galaxies represents the first stage in the lens survey .",
    "examination of intermediate ",
    "resolution optical spectra of an initial sample of 160 colour  selected early  type galaxies revealed the presence of an emission line at @xmath10  in a galaxy with redshift @xmath11 .",
    "follow  up spectroscopy ( warren et al . 1998 ) and imaging ( warren et al . 1999 ) have confirmed the b00472808 system as an optical einstein ring with the source , a star  forming galaxy at @xmath12 , the first confirmed example of a normal galaxy lensing another normal galaxy and a demonstration of the viability of the optimal line  of  sight survey strategy .",
    "with an efficient method for acquiring spectra along many optimal lines  of  sight there is the prospect of obtaining a large sample , 1020 objects , of spatially resolved gravitationally lensed systems . the low ",
    "surface density of the galaxies on the sky means the anglo ",
    "australian telescope s 2df multifibre instrument , with a @xmath13 field , is ideally suited to the initial spectroscopy .",
    "total exposure times of @xmath14s produce galaxy spectra for which the completeness of redshift measurement is @xmath15 and in which anomalous emission lines of fluxes @xmath16erg s@xmath17cm@xmath6 may be reliably detected i.e. fluxes comparable to those seen in high  redshift galaxy samples ( e.g. , hu et al . 1998 ) can be reached .",
    "the unlensed fluxes are a factor @xmath19 fainter .",
    "example spectra of galaxies from 2df are shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "two fields , producing @xmath20 galaxy spectra , can be observed per night .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows the number  redshift distribution for all 485 galaxies observed in a two ",
    "night 2df run .",
    "the median redshift is @xmath21 and the sample consists of luminous , relatively high  redshift objects that barely feature in wide  angle , bright surveys ( e.g. colless 1998 ) or narrow  angle , deep surveys ( e.g. cohen et al . 1999 ; figure  1b ) .",
    "follow  up of an emission line detection in the discovery spectra would , until recently , have involved the acquisition of a second slit  spectrum to confirm the line .",
    "subsequent narrow  band ( @xmath22 ) imaging , at an essentially random wavelength , to investigate the morphology of the emission , necessitates the fabrication of a custom filter , which is both time consuming and costly .",
    "however , the availability of tunable fabry  perot imaging , specifically the taurus tunable filter ( ttf ) instruments at the aat and william herschel telescope , enable monochromatic images to be obtained for emission lines at wavelengths covering virtually the whole optical spectrum",
    ". a resolving power of up to @xmath23 allows the signal  to  noise ratio to be maximised by using narrow bandpasses , @xmath19 , well matched to the narrow emission features . observing efficiency",
    "has been further improved with the recently commissioned broad ",
    "narrow shuffle mode , that allows a comparison broadband image to be obtained during the observation with only a small increase in the total exposure time .",
    "the sensitivity of the ttf system is such that confirmation of emission at the target wavelength can be achieved as quickly as with a slit spectrum .",
    "indeed , the imaging is superior in that even with a relatively wide slit it is possible to exclude prominent emission components , which may lie anywhere on a ring up to 3 arcsec in diameter .",
    "thus , spectroscopic follow ",
    "up may be dispensed with entirely and confirmation and narrow  band imaging achieved using the ttf .",
    "figure  [ fig-3 ] illustrates the effectiveness of the ttf . the image is a composite of a broad  band @xmath24 exposure , from ukirt , and an @xmath25s ttf exposure from the aat .",
    "the candidate lens system is the double image seen at top  centre .",
    "the lower of the two components is the core of a galaxy , redshift @xmath26 , magnitude @xmath27 , coordinates 00@xmath28 42@xmath29 49.5@xmath30 -27@xmath31 52@xmath32 17@xmath33 ( equinox b1950.0 ) .",
    "the spectrum is that of a normal early  type galaxy with the addition of a weak emission line at @xmath34 .",
    "the upper of the components visible in figure  [ fig-3 ] , separated by @xmath35arcsec from the centre of the galaxy , is visible only in the ttf exposure , which covered a @xmath19  bandpass centred at @xmath34 .",
    "the detection of the component in the narrow  band image is unambiguous .",
    "combining the image with two additional ttf exposures produces an image where some evidence of extended emission may be present but much deeper ttf observations are required to confirm any lower surface brightness extended structure or the presence of fainter lensed images .    the most probable identification of the emission is with ly@xmath36 @xmath37  from a star  forming galaxy at redshift @xmath38 . with",
    "this identification b00422752 is a very similar system to b00472808 , the first lens discovered in the survey .",
    "the deflector and source in b00422752 are at slightly higher redshifts and the observed emission line flux is a factor @xmath39 lower , @xmath40 . however , without confirmation of the source redshift , via identification of a second emission line in the infrared ( [ o iii ] 5007 would appear at @xmath41 ) , or evidence for a morphology unambiguously that of a lens , b0042 - 2752 remains only a lens candidate .",
    "alternative explanations are certainly not particularly attractive .",
    "if the emission at @xmath34  is [ o ii ] 3727 the velocity of the line  producing region relative to the galaxy is @xmath42 , ruling out any plausible physical association , even within a rich cluster of galaxies .",
    "chance projection of a faint hii galaxy is possible , with @xmath43 if the line is [ oii ] 3727 , or @xmath44 if the line is [ oiii ] 5007 .",
    "there is no indication of any continuum emission from broad  band imaging data , or the ttf off ",
    "band images , and the putative hii galaxy must possess a large line equivalent  width , with an intrinsically faint continuum .",
    "the object would , for example , lie in the sparsely populated upper portion of figure  2 of hogg et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the survey spectroscopic observations are sensitive to the presence of an emission line object in an area of @xmath45arcsec@xmath8 per galaxy , giving a surveyed area of @xmath46arcsec@xmath8 for the sample of 160 galaxies . assuming , rather optimistically , that [ oii ] or [ oiii ] emission from a star  forming galaxy would be detected in our spectra over the redshift range @xmath47 gives a total volume of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) in which an hii galaxy may be found",
    "therefore , the space density of hii galaxies , with properties consistent with the constraints outlined above , must be @xmath52 for the _ a priori _ probability of finding such an object to be significant .",
    "such a space density is substantially above that found in emission ",
    "line surveys to comparable line fluxes ( e.g. , thompson , djorgovski and trauger 1995 ) .",
    "further observations will determine whether b0042 - 2752 is the second lensed high  redshift galaxy to be identified in the survey .",
    "irrespective of the outcome the combination of the aat 2df instrument and ttf imaging offers the prospect of compiling a well  defined sample of resolved gravitational lenses with a homogeneous deflector population .",
    "investigation of the sample will provide unique information on the mass  to  light ratio in field elliptical galaxies and the morphology , emission line properties and masses of high  redshift star  forming objects currently too faint to be studied by any other means .",
