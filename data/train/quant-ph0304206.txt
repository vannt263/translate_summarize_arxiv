    "many methods of obtaining frequencies or energies from time signals have limited resolution .",
    "this limitation is often expressed in the form of a time - energy uncertainty relation .",
    "for instance , the width @xmath0 of spectral lines in atomic spectroscopy is determined by life time @xmath1 of the excited atoms @xmath2 another example is a fourier transform applied to a discrete time signal in the interval of length @xmath3 . the grid step in a frequency domain and thus the resolution of the method",
    "is given by @xmath4 , which in turn yields @xmath5 all relations of this kind may give a wrong impression that something more fundamental is the source of the uncertainties  a principle that one can not measure energies to an arbitrary precision in a very short time .",
    "such an intuition is common if the system subjected to energy measurement is quantum .",
    "uncertainty principles in quantum mechanics are a mathematical consequence of the following theorem .",
    "two self - adjoint operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 defined on the same hilbert space necessarily obey the relation @xmath8\\rangle| , \\label{qur}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 $ ] is a commutator , @xmath10 stands for quantum average in a given state from the domain of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath11 . in the case of position @xmath12 and momentum @xmath13 operators ( [ qur ] ) gives @xmath14 notice that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are completely determined by the state of the system being measured and have nothing to do with an accuracy of the measuring apparatus .",
    "( [ xpr ] ) holds even if this accuracy is infinite .",
    "the correct approach to the quantum time - energy uncertainties can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the theorem ( [ qur ] ) does not apply to the case of time and energy , simply because time is not an operator , it is just a parameter in quantum mechanics .",
    "one gains nothing forcing the idea that a parameter is a special kind operator because ( [ qur ] ) gives zeros on both sides and does not provide grounds for existence of any time - energy uncertainty relation .",
    "indeed , it has been shown how to precisely measure energy in an arbitrarily short time @xcite .",
    "some methods of the energy measurement have their own limitations @xcite reflected in loss of accuracy when applied for very short time signals . here",
    "i use the method free of such inconveniences .",
    "let us setup some general issues before getting to the details of the method .",
    "suppose that a continuous signal @xmath17 is given in a finite time interval @xmath18 where @xmath19 is finite , @xmath20 is a real amplitude and @xmath21 is a real frequency .",
    "complex frequencies will be considered in future .",
    "the task is to find unknown amplitudes and frequencies of @xmath17 .",
    "what one can see is that @xmath17 is an analytic function of time @xmath22 and , as such , can be uniquely extended beyond the interval @xmath23 .",
    "this means that , in principle , even for tiny @xmath3 it is possible to get all amplitudes and frequencies to a high precision from ( [ sigc ] ) .",
    "unfortunately it seems difficult to solve this nonlinear problem analytically and numerical methods can not handle continuous signals due to infinite number of data points .",
    "one way of getting around this problem is to take only finite number of points at cost of loss of uniqueness of the extension .",
    "however , as will be shown later , this drawback is usually not severe for practical purposes . from now on i shall assume that the signal @xmath17 is known only at @xmath24 equidistant time points @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( [ sigc ] ) can be rewritten as a set of @xmath24 equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "this set has @xmath30 real unknowns ( @xmath19 amplitudes and @xmath19 frequencies ) so the number of equations @xmath24 has to be equal or greater than @xmath19 . this condition would have opened the possibility of existence of a unique solution if the equations were linear in @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is not the case here .",
    "there will always be infinite number of solutions to ( [ sigd ] ) if the set is self - consistent and no solutions otherwise . for reasons explained in the next sections",
    "it will be required that @xmath31 .",
    "notice that discrete fourier transform method assumes the grid of @xmath19 equidistant frequencies and solves ( [ sigd ] ) only for @xmath20 as a linear set of equations",
    ". the more challenging task of solving ( [ sigd ] ) for amplitudes and frequencies is performed by , so called , harmonic inversion method .",
    "the two functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 have the same values at equidistant time points @xmath34 , @xmath26 if @xmath35 the integer number @xmath36 has to be chosen in such a way that the fraction @xmath37 is integer as well .",
    "this implies that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is integer and @xmath40 the time discretization of the signal @xmath17 , the transition from ( [ sigc ] ) to ( [ sigd ] ) , happens at cost of the loss of uniqueness of solutions .",
    "however , as can be seen from ( [ uniq ] ) solutions are unique in finite intervals in frequency domain .",
    "frequency @xmath41 is unique in the interval @xmath42 which can be made large by increasing @xmath43 and/or decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , if one posses prior knowledge about the range of frequencies in a signal it is straightforward to design a sampling step @xmath44 to extract all frequencies in a unique way .",
    "the key idea behind the harmonic inversion method is to replace the original nonlinear problem ( [ sigd ] ) with an eigenvalue problem of an operator , as in ( [ gep ] ) .",
    "the presentation of the method in this section follows that in @xcite .    lets start with a normalized quantum state @xmath45 .",
    "the evolution of this state is generated by unitary evolution operator @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the states @xmath48 are so important that they were given a name of krylov states . for every time signal in ( [ sigd ] )",
    "there exists such an evolution by time @xmath44 operator @xmath49 that the signal can be viewed as an autocorrelation function @xmath50 krylov states in ( [ auto ] ) can be written in the orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of @xmath49 defined by @xmath51 .",
    "namely @xmath52 , where @xmath53 stands for a time independent complex number .",
    "( [ auto ] ) in the new form appears as @xmath54 comparing ( [ nauto ] ) and ( [ gep ] ) one can see that eigenvalues @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is enough to find eigenvalues of @xmath49 in order to obtain all frequencies @xmath21 in the signal @xmath57 .",
    "these frequencies multiplied by @xmath58 can be viewed as eigenenergies of a hypothetical hamiltonian governing the evolution of a system in the initial state @xmath45 . of course",
    ", one can start from the autocorrelation function ( [ auto ] ) and find the eigenenergies of the real system .",
    "it turns out that the matrix elements of @xmath49 in the basis of krylov states can be expressed in terms of @xmath57 alone , i.e. without explicit reference to the states @xmath48 @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the negative indices of @xmath61 in the equation above introduce no complication since @xmath62 . to obtain @xmath19 eigenvalues the dimension @xmath43 of the matrix @xmath63 must be equal or greater than @xmath19 .",
    "it means that the number of complex signal points @xmath57 required by the method exceeds the half of the number of unknowns",
    ". the krylov vectors @xmath48 are normalized but not orthogonal .",
    "thus the eigenequation for matrix @xmath63 in the krylov representation ( [ me ] ) takes the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a matrix of scalar products @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the harmonic inversion method consists of two stages .",
    "first is to solve generalized eigenvalue problem ( [ gep ] ) , where all matrix elements are expressed in terms of @xmath57 , in order to get all frequencies .",
    "second , when all frequencies in ( [ sigd ] ) are known , it is enough to solve linear set of equations for the amplitudes @xmath20 .",
    "there are some practical difficulties in proceeding with the first stage .",
    "for instance , numerical algorithms fail in finding the eigenvalues @xmath68 if the signal duration @xmath3 is small and the number of frequencies @xmath69 .",
    "the second stage is straightforward and will be skipped in this work .",
    "it will be assumed that all real amplitudes @xmath20 are equal and the signal is normalized to unity , i.e. @xmath70 .    in the next section we will see that the crucial role in the numerical approach to ( [ gep ] ) is played by the smallest positive eigenvalue of @xmath65 .",
    "one way of dealing with the generalized eigenvalue problem is to reduce it to the ordinary eigenvalue problem by multiplying both sides of ( [ gep ] ) by the inverse of the hermitian toeplitz matrix @xmath65 .",
    "however , matrix @xmath65 is singular unless @xmath71 and the inverse does not exist . indeed , recall that every vector @xmath48 can be decomposed into a superposition of @xmath19 linearly independent eigenvectors of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the rank of the matrix @xmath65 is @xmath19 . additionally , those nonzero eigenvalues are positive because a scalar product @xmath72 for any nonzero state @xmath73 in a hilbert space .",
    "suppose that columns of a @xmath74 matrix @xmath75 are represented by eigenvectors of matrix @xmath65 to the positive eigenvalues . in order to restrict ( [ gep ] ) to the range of @xmath65 we define @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 is diagonal and positive defined thus the ordinary eigenvalue problem converts to @xmath80 construction of matrix @xmath75 is possible only if one can extract all positive eigenvalues of @xmath65 .",
    "this task becomes hopeless if the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath65 can not be distinguished from zero due to limited accuracy .",
    "the exact analytical expression for the smallest eigenvalue of a toeplitz matrices is not known yet .",
    "here is the approximate formula for the magnitude of the smallest eigenvalue for the short time span @xmath3 of the signal @xmath81^{2(k-1)}. \\label{mineig}\\ ] ] @xmath82 is the magnitude of the greatest ( to the absolute value ) frequency in the signal . for the derivation of ( [ mineig ] ) see the directions in the appendix .",
    "the formula is valid only if the shortness condition is fulfilled , @xmath83 .",
    "the expression in square brackets in ( [ mineig ] ) is smaller than 1 and the @xmath84 decreases exponentially fast with increasing @xmath19 . for the estimated magnitude of the function @xmath85 see fig.[fig1 ] .    .",
    "for every @xmath19 100 sequences of @xmath19 frequencies were randomly generated .",
    "each frequency has been uniformly drawn from the interval @xmath86 .",
    "for each sequence @xmath85 was computed .",
    "circles denote the most probable value of @xmath85 and vertical bars embrace 90% of sequences.,width=325 ]    the eigenvalue @xmath84 is additionally corrupted by inaccuracies of the signal .",
    "the accuracy analysis is presented in the next section .",
    "from now on it will be assumed that the accurate signal @xmath57 is perturbed by noise @xmath87 and the new signal @xmath88 the noise is limited , @xmath89 for all @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "matrix @xmath92 , which is constructed using @xmath93 instead of @xmath57 ( see the text under ( [ gep ] ) ) , remains hermitian .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath92 must obey the inequality @xmath94 if @xmath95 is to be distinguished from perturbed zero eigenvalues the following lower bound on @xmath84 arises @xmath96 this diagnostic condition combined with ( [ mineig ] ) provides the limits of applicability of the harmonic inversion method for short signals .",
    "tracking the inaccuracy propagation when solving ( [ ep ] ) one arrives at the surprising at first sight `` certainty relation '' on perturbed frequencies @xmath97 @xmath98 the error concerning frequencies of short signals can be made arbitrarily small by reducing the noise amplitude !",
    "higher order terms in @xmath99 were dropped in ( [ ina ] ) . for time signals of short duration",
    "the presence of @xmath84 in the denominator in rhs of ( [ ina ] ) is unfavorable .",
    "as stated in ( [ mineig ] ) @xmath84 rapidly goes to zero as @xmath19 increases .",
    "therefore , to extract many accurate frequencies from a short signal the very low level of the noise @xmath99 will be required .    in numerical experiments",
    "the noise is caused by finite precision of floating point numbers .",
    "as an example , the harmonic inversion method was used on a signal with @xmath100 frequencies drawn from an interval @xmath86 , sampled at @xmath101 points with @xmath102 and using 85 digits precision i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    ".[tab : res]numerical example .",
    "all amplitudes @xmath20 were equal . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "notice that the fourier algorithm applied to this signal would give the grid step in frequency domain @xmath104 which is several orders of magnitude greater than the error in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "in the example above @xmath105 .",
    "harmonic inversion method does pretty well when applied to short time signals provided the level of inaccuracies in the input data is very small .    in principle this level can be kept very low in measurement of quantum systems .",
    "for instance , the measurement of quantum autocorrelation function squared ( probability of finding a system in the initial state at different times of its evolution ) can be arbitrarily precise if done simultaneously on many copies of the system . the inaccuracy decreases as an inverse square root of the number of the copies .",
    "this function involves @xmath106 frequencies rather than @xmath19 as in ( [ auto ] ) .    in experimental practice",
    ", however , inaccuracies are big and the method might be useful only for signals with small number of frequencies .",
    "even if desired accuracy is provided another problem may show up .",
    "the harmonic inversion method as described here involves diagonalization of @xmath107 matrix @xmath92 and @xmath108 matrix @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath92 matrix is hermitian toeplitz , the matrix elements are constant along diagonals , and it is enough to store only one row of @xmath92 . solving a linear set of equations with toeplitz matrix requires @xmath110 operations using superfast algorithms @xcite .",
    "perhaps diagonalization of toeplitz matrices can be also speed up bellow @xmath111 operations .",
    "the complexity of the second diagonalization is @xmath112 operations but here no eigenvectors need to be computed .",
    "remember that all these operations has to be done with high precision and are , therefore , relatively slow .",
    "the diagonalization related difficulties has been overcome for long signals @xcite .",
    "for such problems the frequency domain was effectively divided into smaller intervals containing fewer frequencies and the harmonic inversion , known there as filter diagonalization , was applied to one interval at the time .",
    "splitting the frequency domain introduces however its own inaccuracies into the computed frequencies of the signal and filter diagonalization methods are said to obey their own time - frequency uncertainty relations .",
    "the total duration of the signal is limited from bellow by local density of frequencies @xcite or by minimal and average frequency distance @xcite .",
    "it is not clear yet whether these restrictions can be invalidated by improved precision of calculations .",
    "in this work i presented the application of the harmonic inversion method to short time signals .",
    "i have demonstrated that the method has no fundamental limitations regarding the length of the signals .",
    "it works for arbitrarily short signals if sufficient accuracy of the input data is provided .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that it is possible to extract energies from the short autocorrelation function generated by a quantum system .",
    "the method can be also applied to short autocorrelation functions squared which have a clear experimental interpretation .",
    "its measurement can be , in principle , carried out in arbitrarily short interval of time and still all energies involved in its evolution can be extracted to a desired accuracy .",
    "i am grateful to jacek dziarmaga , krzysztof sacha , jakub zakrzewski and george zweig for many stimulating discussions .",
    "work supported by kbn grant 5 p03b 088 21 .",
    "the direct calculation of @xmath84 is hard . what can be done without much effort is the prediction of the general form of the expression for this quantity .",
    "the first step is the observation that since each matrix element of @xmath65 is a sum of @xmath19 exponents as in ( [ sigd ] ) then @xmath65 can be written as a sum of @xmath19 matrices @xmath113 , where each matrix @xmath114 depends only on one frequency @xmath21 .",
    "matrix @xmath114 is hermitian and has only one nonzero eigenvalue @xmath43 and corresponding eigenvector @xmath115/\\sqrt{n}$ ] .",
    "eigenvectors @xmath116 form a nonorthogonal basis .",
    "lets construct a @xmath117 matrix @xmath118 by filing its rows with vectors @xmath116 .",
    "eigenvalues of @xmath119 multiplied by @xmath43 give the all nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath65 . the characteristic equation for eigenvalues of @xmath119 @xmath120 can be expanded at @xmath121 to the first order to give an estimate for the smallest eigenvalue @xmath122 the matrix @xmath119 above is conveniently divided by @xmath19 to normalize its trace to unity . for @xmath71",
    "matrix @xmath118 becomes square and @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 .",
    "the parameter @xmath126 is given by sum of minors of @xmath127 and @xmath128 . @xmath129 and @xmath130 are functions of normalized frequencies @xmath131 .",
