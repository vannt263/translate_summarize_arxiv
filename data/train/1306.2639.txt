    "over the last few decades , imaging and spectroscopy in the bandpass has undergone dramatic improvements thanks to advancements from a progression of  observatories . due to its proximity and starburst nature",
    ", the nearby galaxy ngc  253 ( @xmath9  mpc based on the tip of the red - giant branch ; karachentsev  2004 ) has been an ideal target for studying  emission from regions more actively star - forming than the milky way and other local group galaxies ( e.g. , fabbiano & trinchieri 1984 ; ptak  1997 ; vogler & pietsch 1999 ; pietsch  2000 , 2001 ; strickland  2000 ; weaver  2002 ; bauer  2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "studies of ngc  253 have revealed a diversity of  emitting populations throughout the galaxy .",
    "a few dozen  point sources have been detected across the optical extent of the disk ( e.g. , pietsch  2001 ) .",
    "a thin @xmath00.4  kev plasma extends several arcminutes along the plane of the disk , and @xmath01  kev gas has been observed in a collimated kpc - scale outflow emanating from the nuclear starburst ( e.g. , strickland  2000 ; bauer  2008 ; mitsuishi  2012 ) .",
    "the inner nuclear region has been resolved by  into a few bright point sources within a @xmath760  arcsec@xmath10 region ( i.e. , the inner @xmath7150  pc ) . in this region ,",
    "a complex line structure of fe  k has been resolved into at least three spectral components due to fe  i at 6.4  kev , fe  xxv at 6.7  kev , and fe  xxvi at 7.0  kev , potentially powered by the combination of an obscured agn , supernova ( sn ) remnants , and/or  binaries ( mitsuishi  2011 ) .",
    "the point sources include individual  binaries and/or the collective emission from sources within star - forming clouds ( e.g. , sn remnants and  binaries ) , as well as a hard  point source ( appearing at energies @xmath32  kev ) that is located within the 1.2 arcsec 3@xmath2 uncertainty radius of the dynamical center of the galaxy ( mller - snchez  2010 ) .",
    "the central hard  point - source has been speculated to be either an obscured ( @xmath11  @xmath5 ) , low - luminosity ( @xmath12  ) agn or a super star cluster lit up by sn and/or sn remnants .",
    "high - resolution studies of the nuclear region of ngc  253 at other wavelengths have revealed a multitude of compact sources within the inner @xmath0200  pc ( @xmath010  arcsec ) of the nucleus .",
    "the star - formation rate ( sfr ) within this region , based on free - free emission , is estimated to be @xmath02  ( rodrguez - rico  2006 ) , perhaps larger than that of the entire milky way (;",
    "hammer  2007 ) .",
    "the central black hole mass has been estimated to be @xmath7@xmath13  based on kinematics of the h53@xmath14 ( 43  ghz ) and h92@xmath14 ( 8.31  ghz ) recombination lines within the central 18  pc ( 0.4  arcsec ) of the nucleus ( rodrguez - rico  2006 ) .",
    "within @xmath01  arcsec of the dynamical center are two radio sources , th2 and th4 , which are separated by 0.36  arcsec and have been both agn candidates and candidate markers of the galactic center ( ulvestad & antonucci  1997 ) .",
    "th2 is the brightest source in the region and has historically been adopted as the location of the galactic center .",
    "the nature of th2 is still unknown , as the radio spectrum is consistent with both a low luminosity agn ( llagn ) and a very compact sn remnant ( e.g. , brunthaler  2009 ) .",
    "th4 has been identified as a water - vapor maser source ( e.g. , hofner  2006 ) , which initially suggested an agn origin .",
    "however , continuum and maser line imaging with the very large array ( vla ) and very long baseline array ( vlba ) showed that there was no strong continuum point source on arcsecond to milliarcsecond scales , suggesting that the masing source is most likely to originate from star - formation processes and not a llagn ( brunthaler  2009 ) .",
    "sub - arcsecond near - ir imaging with the very large telescope ( vlt ) adaptive optics system found several star - forming regions in the near vicinity of the nucleus ; however , no counterparts were found to th2 and th4 , again limiting the viability of an agn presence in ngc  253 ( fernndez - ontiveros  2009 ) .",
    "the above studies have revealed that the central nuclear region is almost certainly dominated by star formation processes in the radio and near - ir ; however , definitively distinguishing between the starburst and agn nature in the  band has not yet been possible .    in this paper , we present new insight into the nature of the nuclear region in ngc  253 as a result of a monitoring campaign consisting of three nearly simultaneous observations with the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ (; harrison  2013 ) and . within the unique energy range constrained by , @xmath71040  kev for ngc  253 , the spectrum associated with a",
    "heavily obscured or low - luminosity agn will differ dramatically from non - agn spectra ( e.g. , sn , sn remnants ,  binaries , and ultraluminous  sources [ ulxs ] ) .",
    "our monitoring campaign therefore allowed us to simultaneously constrain the spectrum of the central nuclear region up to @xmath740  kev and sensitively measure the locations and contributions of the multiple  sources associated with the same region using subarcsecond imaging with .",
    "the galactic column density in the direction of ngc  253 is @xmath15  @xmath5 ( stark  1992 ) .",
    "all fluxes and luminosities quoted here have been corrected for galactic absorption . at the distance of ngc  253 , 1",
    "arcsec corresponds to a physical distance of 19  pc .",
    "unless stated otherwise , quoted uncertainties throughout this paper correspond to 90% confidence intervals .",
    "our nearly simultaneous  and  observations of ngc  253 were conducted in three observational epochs that began on 2012 september 1 , 2012 september 15 , and 2012 november 16 ; hereafter , epochs  1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . during each epoch",
    ", we obtained integrated exposures of @xmath7165  ks with  and @xmath720  ks with . in figure  1 , we show the relative  and  observational coverage for the three epochs .",
    "we note that due to earth occultations and passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the  on target observational efficiency was 5463% ( see harrison  2013 for further details ) .",
    "therefore , each  observation was completed over 260306  ks ( i.e. , 33.5  days ; see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for epochs  1 and 2 , the shorter  exposure was conducted within the  observational interval ; however , for epoch  3 , the start of the  observation preceded that of the observation by @xmath71  day .",
    "additional nearly simultaneous observations were taken with the vlba at 1.4  ghz in 8  hr exposures . however , due to their depth and frequency , these observations did not yield detections of the candidate nuclear sources th2 and th4 , and are therefore not discussed further here .",
    "details regarding the vlba data and ngc  253 galaxy - wide radio population properties will be presented in a future paper ( argo , in preparation ) .",
    "each @xmath7165  ks  exposure was conducted using both telescopes , a + b , which collected photons from the same @xmath16 region centered on the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "we performed data reduction using heasoft 6.12 and nustardas  v.  0.9.0 with caldb v.  20121126 .",
    "we processed level  1 data to level  2 products by running nupipeline , which performs a variety of data reduction steps , including filtering out bad pixels , screening for cosmic rays and observational intervals when the background was too high ( e.g. , during passes through the saa ) , and projecting accurately the events to sky coordinates by determining the optical axis position and correcting for the dynamic relative offset of the optics bench to the focal plane bench due to motions of the 10  m mast that connects these two benches . in figure  2@xmath17 , we display a  image of ngc  253 , which was constructed by merging data from all three observational epochs .",
    "all three of the @xmath720  ks  exposures were conducted using single acis - i pointings ( obsids 13830 , 13831 , and 13832 ) with the approximate position of the nucleus set as the aimpoint . for our data reduction , we used ciao  v.  4.4 with caldb  v.  4.5.0 .",
    "we reprocessed our events lists , bringing level  1 to level  2 using the script chandra_repro , which identifies and removes events from bad pixels and columns , and filters events lists to include only good time intervals without significant flares and non - cosmic ray events corresponding to the standard  grade set ( grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) .",
    "we constructed an initial  source catalog by searching a image with wavdetect ( run with a point spread function [ psf ] map created using mkpsfmap ) , which was set at a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath18 and run over seven scales from 18 ( spaced out by factors of @xmath19 in wavelet scale : 1 , @xmath19 , 2 , 2@xmath19 , 4 , 4@xmath19 , and 8) .",
    "each initial source catalog was cross - matched to an equivalent catalog , which we created following the above procedure using a moderately deep ( @xmath780  ks )  acis - s exposure from 2003 september 20 ( obsid : 3931 ) .",
    "the 2003 observation is the deepest  image available for ngc  253 and has an aimpoint close to those of the three 2012 observations . for the purpose of comparing point sources in the 2012 observations with those of the deep 2003 exposure",
    ", we chose to register the 2012 aspect solutions and events lists to the 2003 frame using ciao tools reproject_aspect and reproject_events , respectively .",
    "the resulting astrometric reprojections gave very small astrometric adjustments , including linear translations of  pixels and  pixels , rotations of @xmath20 to @xmath21  deg , and pixel scale stretch factors of 0.999963 to 1.000095 .",
    "the final pixel scale of all observations was 0.492  arcsec per pixel .",
    "figures  2@xmath222@xmath23 show 27  kev  cut - outs of the central nuclear region of ngc  253 for our 2012 campaign and the 2003 observation .",
    "these images from our 2012 campaign clearly illustrate that the nuclear region can be resolved into three bright 27  kev point sources , a , b , and c ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath222@xmath23 ) , which appear as a single point source with s @xmath718  arcsec full - width half max ( fwhm ) psf ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath17 ) .",
    "the source located @xmath71  arcsec to the south of the dynamical center ( but within the 3@xmath2 dynamical center uncertainty radius of 1.2  arcsec ) , source  b ( ( @xmath14,@xmath24)@xmath25 = 00@xmath26  47@xmath27  33.18@xmath28 , @xmath29  17  18.48 ) , is clearly variable and represents the best candidate in our 2012 observations for a nuclear point source . in the 2003 observation ( fig .",
    "2@xmath23 ) , the nearest nuclear source to source  b ( offset by @xmath71  arcsec ) is labeled `` n-2003 '' ( ( @xmath14,@xmath24)@xmath25 = 00@xmath26  47@xmath27  33.12@xmath28 , @xmath29  17  17.87 ) .",
    "our analyses below focus on uncovering the nature of source  b and n-2003 .",
    "we began by extracting the  spectra from the nuclear region of ngc  253 for each of the three observations . in order to encompass a large fraction of the source counts in the nuclear region ,",
    "while minimizing contamination from nearby unrelated sources , we chose to extract the spectra using circular regions with radii of 20  arcsec ( @xmath7400  pc ) , somewhat larger than the  half - width at half max ( i.e. , @xmath79  arcsec ) .",
    "this choice of aperture encompasses 32% of the  psf ( half - power radius 29  arcsec ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted from larger apertures ( 1737  arcmin@xmath10 depending on the observational epoch ) , which were defined by eye as source - free regions .",
    "we note that ngc  253 x-1 , the bright off - nuclear source @xmath730  arcsec to the south of the nucleus , is a ulx with @xmath30  @xmath31  ( based on analysis below ) and provides some non - negligible contribution to the nuclear region spectra ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath17 ) . to estimate these contributions",
    ", we extracted spectra of this source using 20  arcsec radii circular apertures .",
    "the spectra of ngc  253 x-1 were fit using xspec  v.12.7.1 ( arnaud  1996 ) and a broken power - law model bknpower with varying normalization .",
    "we found a best - fit low - energy slope of @xmath32 , break energy @xmath33  kev , and high - energy slope @xmath34 ; no absorption was required in any of these fits .",
    "these values are similar to those of ulxs studied in detail by gladstone  ( 2009 ) , which have @xmath35  @xmath31  , and are fit well by broken power - law models with @xmath36  , @xmath37  , and @xmath38  . using a psf model",
    ", we estimate that the contributions of ngc  253 x-1 to the nuclear region spectra are small ( @xmath3910% for all three epochs ) . from our best - fit spectral models for ngc  253 x-1 , we constructed fake background spectra corresponding to its contributions to the nuclear region spectra .",
    "these were used when performing spectral fits to the nuclear region itself ( see below ) . to test the robustness of this procedure , we measured the spectral contributions from the wings of the _ nuclear region _ psfs to see if they influenced the extracted spectra of ngc  253 x-1 . once contributions from the nuclear region psfs were subtracted , we found only very small differences ( at the @xmath397% level ) in spectral parameters and normalizations derived for ngc  253 x-1 .",
    "such differences translate into @xmath391% differences in the derived spectral properties of the nuclear region itself , well below the precision of our measurements .",
    "we therefore conclude that our procedure for estimating the contributions of ngc  253 x-1 to the nuclear region is robust .    in figure  3@xmath17 , we present the  spectra of the central nuclear region for the three epochs .",
    "we do not include the  spectra of the nuclear point sources here , since a direct matching between the multiple components that lie within the  beam is complex and unneccessary for understanding the hard  properties of the nuclear region that we are interested in here .",
    "we know that the  emission from the central nuclear region is a combination of hot plasma , as well as non - variable and variable power - law sources ( i.e. ,  binaries and a putative agn ) .",
    "we therefore fit the spectra ( with background and ngc  253 x-1 contributions subtracted ) of all three epochs simultaneously using an apec plasma model to account for the hot gas plus two power - law components that account for the non - variable and variable power - law sources , the latter of which we expect to be primarily due to source  b. we note that the  emitting gas is likely to be complex and contain multiple components ( e.g. , pietsch  2001 ; mitsuishi  2012 ) .",
    "however , since these components have their strongest influence at energies , we chose to utilize a single hot plasma to account for the fe - line emission .",
    "such a component is expected to account for hot gas in the core of the starburst associated with sn remnants ( see , e.g. , pietsch  2001 ) .",
    "our adopted model provides a good fit to the data ( see fig .",
    "3@xmath17 ) by simply varying only the normalization of the power - law associated with variable sources like source  b. our best - fit model parameters include an apec plasma with @xmath40  kev , a non - variable unobscured power - law component with @xmath41 , and an absorbed ( @xmath42 \\times 10^{23}$ ]  @xmath5 ) variable power - law with @xmath43 .",
    "the 720  kev flux of the nuclear region was factors of @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( 1@xmath2 errors ) times higher in epochs  2 and 3 , respectively , than its flux in epoch  1 ( @xmath46  ) .",
    "we also tried accounting for the variability by allowing the variable power - law absorption column , photon index , and normalization components to vary in different combinations .",
    "holding the normalization constant and varying the column density alone provided an acceptable fit and resulted in column densities @xmath3@xmath47  @xmath5 and @xmath48 . holding the normalization and varying only the photon index between epochs did not provide an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "finally , varying the column density , photon index , and normalization components simultaneously provided a good fit to the data , and indicate that the variable component had high absorption columns ( @xmath49  @xmath5 ) and steep photon indices ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "none of the above variations improved the quality of the fits to the data over a simple variation in normalization between epochs .",
    "this analysis indicates that the spectral slope is much steeper than that found for typical agn ( @xmath51  1.52.2 ; e.g. , corral  2011 ; vasudevan  2013 ) .      as discussed in @xmath522 above , the nuclear region of ngc  253",
    "is resolved by  into three bright point sources detected at within a @xmath760  arcsec@xmath10 region .",
    "the  psf is too large to distinguish spatially these sources .",
    "however , the  and  spectral coverages overlap in the energy range of @xmath737  kev , allowing us to measure indirectly the levels that each source contributes to the  flux variations . with , we found that only the central source ( labeled source `` b '' in fig .",
    "2@xmath222@xmath23 ) varied significantly over the three epochs .",
    "to estimate the fractional contributions that source  b provided to the total  extraction region spectra , we measured 47  kev count - rates from source  b and a larger nuclear region using circular apertures of 1.0  arcsec and 15  arcsec , respectively .",
    "we find that the 47  kev flux from the larger nuclear region was factors of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( 1@xmath2 errors ) higher in epochs  2 and 3 , respectively , compared with epoch  1 ; this is consistent with the  observations over the same energy range , which were @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( 1@xmath2 errors ) , respectively .",
    "given that the shorter 20  ks ( 0.23  day )  exposures did not cover the entire @xmath733.5  day periods spanned by the  observations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , this result indicates that the nuclear region was unlikely to vary substantially during each of the observational epochs .",
    "we verified this result by inspecting light curves of the nuclear region .",
    "these light curves were constructed by extracting events lists from a 10  arcsec radius circle centered on the nucleus and measuring the mean count - rates of this region in 20  ks bins .",
    "we found no signatures of strong variability within each of the three observational epochs .",
    "a k - s test revealed that each of the nuclear region light curves were consistent with those expected from constant - intensity sources .",
    "we therefore conclude that the nuclear region did not vary substantially on timescales of @xmath7648  hr .",
    "our  observations indicate that source  b itself was brighter in epochs  2 and 3 compared with epoch  1 by factors of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( 1@xmath2 errors ) , respectively .",
    "once we subtract the contributions of source  b to the total  fluxes , contained within the larger  extraction region , we find no significant remaining variations in the 47  kev non - source  b emission between all three epochs , indicating that nuclear region variability observed within the  psf , at least in the 47  kev band , are likely entirely attributable to variations in source  b.        assuming the _ nustar _ variability is primarily due to variations in source b , we can estimate its spectra by differencing the total nuclear region spectra between bright and faint epochs . since the variations in the total _ nustar _",
    "spectra appear to be consistent with only changes in spectral normalization and not shape ( see above ) , we assume that @xmath59 , the total nuclear region spectrum in epoch @xmath60 , is described by @xmath61 where the constant @xmath62 represents all the non - variable emission in the nuclear region ( e.g. , due to sources a and c , as well as diffuse emission ) , the constant @xmath63 represents the spectrum of source b , and @xmath64 represents the variable normalization of source b at epoch @xmath60 . indeed , figure@xmath65 shows the difference spectra , which are well fit by an absorbed broken power - law model with best - fit @xmath66  @xmath5 , low - energy slope of @xmath67 , break energy @xmath68  kev , and high - energy slope @xmath69 for both cases , with only the normalization varying .",
    "fitting the difference spectra of epoch  2 minus epoch  1 and epoch  3 minus epoch  1 separately yields similar best - fit parameters and no improvement in spectral fit , implying the spectral shape of source  b did not vary significantly between epochs 2 and 3 .",
    "equation  1 then implies @xmath70 from the _ chandra _ observations , we know that @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we note that no fe line was necessary in our fits to source  b implying that variable fe emission is not seen in this source .",
    "this result alone likely rules out the possibility that source  b is a more luminous version of the variable fe reflection nebulae seen in the galactic center , since we would expect corresponding variability in the fe emission line ( e.g. , ponti  2010 ) .",
    "integration of our spectral model and eqn .",
    "2 implies the 210  kev fluxes of source  b were @xmath77.4 and @xmath73  , for observations 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "these fluxes correspond to observed 210  kev luminosities of @xmath74 and @xmath75  , respectively .",
    "the unabsorbed , intrinsic 210  kev luminosities are therefore @xmath76 and @xmath77  , respectively .",
    "we note that the central black hole of ngc  253 has been estimated to be @xmath7@xmath13  ( rodrguez - rico 2006 ) .",
    "such a black hole would have an eddington luminosity of @xmath78  .",
    "for this approximation , we assumed a 210  kev bolometric correction of @xmath722.4 , which corresponds to the median bolometric correction for local agn with @xmath79@xmath80  ( vasudevan & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "if source  b were powered by the black hole , then it would be accreting at @xmath010@xmath81 eddington .",
    "agn with these levels of @xmath82 typically have spectral slopes of @xmath83 ( e.g. , shemmer  2006 ; younes  2011 ) , much shallower than the spectrum measured for source  b. this suggests that source  b is unlikely to be powered by a low - luminosity agn . instead",
    ", the measured luminosities , lack of variability on the @xmath7548  hr timescales , and  spectral shape of source  b closely resemble the properties of binaries in the ultraluminous state , which include ulxs that are likely to be stellar - mass black holes accreting above the eddington limit ( e.g. , roberts  2007 ; heil  2009 ; gladstone  2009 ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that source  b is a ulx and not an agn . given that the number of ulxs in galaxies has been observed to correlate with galaxy - wide sfr ( e.g. , mineo  2012 ) , it would not be surprising to find a ulx associated with the nuclear starburst of ngc  253 .",
    "indeed , multiple bright point sources and transient ulxs have also been observed in the nuclear starburst in m82 ( e.g. , feng & kaaret  2007 ) .",
    "such a feature may be ubiquitous among starburst galaxies . at distances",

    ". a similar hard source located @xmath70.4  arcsec from the dynamical center was previously reported by mller - snchez  ( 2010 ) , based on the  observation from 2003 . in figure  2@xmath23 , we show the nuclear region image of the first 20  ks of the 2003 observation ( to be equivalent to the depth of our 2012 epochs ) , with the average locations of the 2012 sources circled .",

    "the moderately - deep 45  ks observation ( obsid :  790 ) , also conducted in december of 1999 , had an aimpoint displaced @xmath75  arcmin from the nuclear region , which effectively blended the psfs making it impossible to spatially measure whether n-2003 or source  b were present . finally , the @xmath72  ks exposure conducted in august of 2000 ( obsid :  383 ) was too shallow to detect either n-2003 or source  b. we therefore choose to restrict further comparisons of our 2012 observations to the 2003 exposure",

    "taken together , we infer that source  b is unrelated to n-2003 .    , with an fe component added .",
    "the solid green curve shows the same model renormalized to the @xmath395  kev spectrum of n-2003 .",
    "the bottom panel displays the ratio between the data and the 2012 model ( solid curves in the top panel ) , illustrating that n-2003 has a harder spectrum than source  b. the  spectrum of n-2003 can be fit well by an absorbed power - law with @xmath85  @xmath5 and @xmath86 ( _ dashed curve _ in the top panel ) , which differs from the @xmath87 slope of source  b. , width=336 ]    the above analysis shows convincingly that n-2003 is unrelated to source  b implying that at least one of these sources is not associated with the central black hole .",
    "our spectral constraints , presented in @xmath523.2 , show that source  b is most likely to be a ulx . on the other hand n-2003",
    "is offset from the dynamical center by only @xmath70.4  arcsec ( i.e. , within the 1.2  arcsec 3@xmath2 uncertainty of the dynamical center ) , indicating that it is a better candidate for a `` true '' nuclear  point source that may be an agn ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath23 ) . in figure  5",
    ", we show the 38  kev  spectra of n-2003 and source  b ( when at its peak in epoch  2 ) .",
    "we note that the morphology of the diffuse 38  kev  emission in the nuclear region is complex and appears brightest in the immediate vicinity of n-2003 and source  b ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath222@xmath23 ) .",
    "as such , detailed modeling of the background spectrum associated with the diffuse emission in this region is difficult . to mitigate this limitation , we restricted our  spectral analysis to energies above 3  kev to exclude strong continuum contributions from the hot ism and added an fe component at 6.7  kev to account for the gas emission line ( see @xmath523.1 for motivation ) .",
    "given that the  difference spectra of source  b do not show a strong fe line ( see fig .",
    "3@xmath22 ) , we do not expect that this component is intrinsic to source  b ; however , we are less certain about the nature of the fe line associated with n-2003 .",
    "the best - fitting spectral model for source  b , presented in @xmath523.1 , renormalized to the 35  kev flux of n-2003 , is obviously far too steep to fit the higher - energy 58  kev spectrum of n-2003 , supporting the conclusion that source  b and n-2003 are different , despite having similar 210  kev fluxes . as a caveat ,",
    "we note that binaries accreting at near - eddington rates can have variable spectral properties without substantial changes in luminosity ( e.g. , grs  1915 + 105 ; vierdayanti  2010 ) , implying that the harder spectrum of n-2003 does not rule out a ulx origin similar in nature to source  b. the  spectrum of n-2003 can be fit well using an absorbed power - law model with @xmath88  @xmath5 and @xmath89 , and an fe line fixed at 6.7  kev . if we used only the  data to fit the spectrum of source  b , we find @xmath90  @xmath5 and @xmath91 , consistent with the values found from our  analysis in @xmath523.2 .",
    "although the fitting parameters of n-2003 and source  b are formally consistent , the spectrum of n-2003 is harder than that of source  b ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "5 ) , and more consistent with an agn ( @xmath51  1.52.2 ; see further discussion above ) .    due to its close proximity to the dynamical center and its harder spectrum , it is plausible that n-2003 is an agn that was in a low state during our 2012 monitoring campaign . however , we can not currently rule out a ulx nature for n-2003 .",
    "if n-2003 were an agn , the @xmath86 power - law spectrum would extend well into the  bandpass out to beyond @xmath740  kev .",
    "the observed flux of n-2003 is 1.1 times that of source  b in epoch  2 .",
    "however , if n-2003 were an agn , then we predict that it would have had a flux @xmath32.5 times higher than that of source  b at its peak in epoch  2 .",
    "therefore , future monitoring of ngc  253 with both  and  would be able to resolve the degeneracy between the agn and ulx nature of n-2003 if caught in a high state .",
    "we performed nearly simultaneous  and  monitoring of the nearby starburst galaxy ngc  253 over three observational epochs : beginning 2012 september 1 , 2012 september 15 , and 2012",
    "november 16 .",
    "we find that the 720  kev nuclear region flux was elevated over the epoch  1 level by factors of @xmath71.7 and @xmath71.4 in epochs  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "our observations show that a single variable source , which we call source  b ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath222@xmath23 ) , was responsible for driving this variation .",
    "the difference spectra ( i.e. , subtracting epoch  1 from the bright states in epochs  2 and 3 ) allows us to study the spectrum of source  b over the 320  kev energy range .",
    "source  b has a peak observed 210  kev luminosity of @xmath7@xmath92  ( estimated unabsorbed , intrinsic @xmath93  ) and is fit well by a broken power - law model with spectral slopes and a break energy within the range of values characteristic of ulxs and not agn .",
    "a previous  observation in 2003 revealed a hard  source `` n-2003 '' that had a similar 27  kev flux to that observed for source  b in epoch  2 ; however , the position of n-2003 is displaced from source  b by @xmath71  arcsec .",
    "the high - precision imaging of  allows us to show at the @xmath899.99% confidence level that n-2003 is unrelated to source  b. further examination of the position of n-2003 indicates that it is a better agn candidate than source  b ; however , the  spectrum alone can not rule out that n-2003 may be a second ulx .",
    "we predict that if n-2003 were an agn , then a  observation would have yielded a 1020  kev flux that was @xmath32.5 times higher than that of source  b at its peak brightness . in light of this",
