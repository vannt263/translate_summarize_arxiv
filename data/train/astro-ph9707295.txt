    "it is well known that the lyman alpha forest shows very little gunn - peterson absorption along lines of sight to distant quasars .",
    "the standard interpretation of these observations is that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) becomes highly ionized before redshift @xmath1 .",
    "the approximate reionization redshift is among the most important unknown quantities relevant to large scale structure and cosmology .",
    "there have been many attempts to simulate the reionization process , but they are strongly dependent on the input physics and are hence unreliable .",
    "in fact , it is still quite plausible to have reionization occur anywhere between redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath2 in most reasonable cosmological models .",
    "it is observations that constrain the reionization epoch to this range : the lack of the compton @xmath3-distortion of the cmb excludes @xmath4 and the lack of gunn - peterson absorption excludes @xmath5 .    because of the uncertainty in the reionization epoch",
    ", it is important to be able to observe the reionization event in some way .",
    "we propose a new signal in the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) that is potentially capable of giving the redshift of reionization .",
    "while the signal is small relative to the current limits at 1 - 10 @xmath6 m , the predicted frequency dependence makes detection possible .",
    "the rate of hydrogen recombinations is peaked at the reionization epoch , and this is the source of the background we seek .",
    "the fraction of neutral hydrogen undergoes a drop of a factor of at least 10@xmath7 in about a tenth of a hubble time , thus the gunn - peterson optical depth undergoes a drastic change in a very small redshift interval .",
    "this abrupt change in absorption can give an accurate value for the redshift of reionization . because we observe an all - sky background , we are only concerned with the effects absorption has on the spectrum .",
    "it serves to brighten some lines while dimming others .",
    "because the effect turns off very rapidly , sharp features are produced in the spectrum .",
    "in order to be specific , we adopt a cdm+@xmath0 cosmological model as a framework for our investigations .",
    "we fix the cosmological parameters as follows : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "we study two values of the baryon density parameter , @xmath11 and 0.055 . we allow for a small tilt in the primordial spectrum of @xmath12 , and we normalize the model to cobe according to bunn & white ( 1997 ) . in order to accurately determine the initial conditions ,",
    "we compute the linear transfer functions for the model using the linear boltzmann code linger from the cosmics package ( bertschinger 1995 ) .",
    "the simulations were performed with the slh - p@xmath7 m cosmological hydrodynamic code ( gnedin 1995 ; gnedin & bertschinger 1996 ) .",
    "the physical modeling incorporated in the code is described in gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , and includes dynamics of the dark matter and cosmic gas , evolution of the spatially averaged uv- and x - ray background radiation , star formation , stellar feedback , non - equilibrium ionization and thermal evolution of primeval plasma , molecular hydrogen chemistry , equilibrium metal cooling , and self - shielding of the gas .",
    "we have performed six runs with different box sizes and numerical resolutions to assess the importance of different scales and estimate the uncertainty due to the finite resolution of our simulations as well as to test different physical assumptions included in the simulations .",
    "the adopted parameters of these runs are compiled in table [ tabnumpar ] .",
    "the first four runs were stopped at @xmath13 , since at that moment the rms density fluctuation at the box scale reaches 0.3 - 0.4 , and the absence of fluctuations with wavelengths larger than the box size renders the simulations unreliable .",
    "the two runs e and f were continued until @xmath14 , and are used to assess the evolution of the recombination rate at low redshifts . because of their low resolution , they can not be used for calculating the reionization history of the universe .",
    "the largest of our simulations , run a , has the highest resolution , and is our fiducial run .",
    "its spatial and mass resolutions are sufficient to accurately predict the epoch of reionization and the evolution of the recombination rate throughout the reionization period",
    ". two smaller runs , b and c , differ by the shape of the spectrum emitted by the sources of ionization .",
    "specifically , run c includes only young stars as sources of ionization , whereas run b includes quasars in the ionizing radiation .",
    "finally , run d has a lower value of the baryon density .",
    "this run is discussed in detail in gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) .",
    "the space averaged equation of radiative transfer in an expanding universe is @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "we need the intensity of a sharp line at frequency @xmath17 as a function of its redshift .",
    "the source for an infinitely sharp line is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume rate of photon emission and @xmath20 is the dirac delta function .",

    "the case a recombination rate is computed from the simulation data by obtaining the average @xmath26 over the simulation box .",
    "the fit to @xmath27 from hui and gnedin ( 1997 ) was used .",
    "this quantity drops steadily before reionization as the universe expands .",
    "there is a rise at the reionization epoch as the hydrogen becomes nearly completely ionized .",
    "after reionization , the rate declines steadily until the end of the simulation .    from the case a recombination rate we need to obtain the direct recombination rates to the individual levels .",
    "we use the rates in ferland et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the mean temperature of the gas over the simulation box , which is about 10@xmath28 k. for levels @xmath29 we have used the following fit which reproduces the summed values well at least to @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 these three values correspond to the three summed recombination rates at 10@xmath28 k in ferland et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "these values reproduce the @xmath35 recombination coefficient well , but the @xmath35 rate was not used in making the fit . at large @xmath36 this fit becomes negative , but this does not happen until @xmath37 or so .",
    "we use the approximation given by johnson ( 1971 ) for the radiative transition rates in hydrogen . knowing the rates of direct recombinations to various levels",
    ", we can then compute the strengths of lines .",
    "we find that the emission is dominated by the direct recombination photons .",
    "we have used a simple approximation to account for the absorption . because we are investigating a diffuse signal , we are only concerned with how energy is redistributed among different spectral lines .",
    "we assume that the optical depth is very large before reionization and very small afterwards .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation because the simulations indicate that the neutral hydrogen fraction drops by three orders of magnitude in about a tenth of a hubble time .",
    "we refer to this as the reionization event .",
    "the justification of our approximation is as follows .",
    "the gunn - peterson optical depth is given by @xmath38 .",
    "the current observational limit indicates that @xmath39 , giving @xmath40 .",
    "we neglect this relatively small optical depth . before reionization however , the neutral fraction is a factor of at least 10@xmath41 higher , possibly as much as a factor of @xmath42 higher , giving a gunn - peterson optical depth of at least @xmath43 , and probably 10@xmath28 .",
    "the other lines in the lyman series will have smaller optical depths due to their smaller cross sections , but this effect does not refute this argument .",
    "for example , the optical depth of ly-7 is only decreased by a factor of 100 .",
    "this justifies our approximation .",
    "we assume that any transition that is not in the lyman series is optically thin .",
    "there are a large number of neutral hydrogen atoms for each photon , so the hydrogens will be virtually all in the ground state . each time",
    "a lyman series transition is excited , there is some chance that it will decay through other states",
    ". these photons can escape unless they are also in the lyman series .",
    "the net effect of this is that photons are removed from the lyman series and broken up into lower energy photons and ly@xmath44 .",
    "we now estimate how many times this process occurs .",
    "the probability to remain in the lyman series is simply @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the probability of remaining after one interaction .",
    "the branching ratios for the @xmath48 transitions are all roughly 95% , with the @xmath49 transitions making up most of the remaining 5% , thus @xmath50 , giving @xmath51 . through the reionization event",
    ", @xmath52 drops from about @xmath53 to about 1 , so previous to reionization , lyman series photons suffer as many as @xmath42 absorptions .",
    "we approximate this process by recomputing the branching ratios , taking into account the fact that radiative transitions in the lyman series are forbidden , except for ly@xmath44 , where there is no other possibility .",
    "these modified branching ratios are used until the reionization event .",
    "after even 100 such decays , the probability that every single one was a lyman series decay is about @xmath54 .",
    "our approximation for the branching ratios is thus justified .",
    "we find that ly@xmath44 becomes about three times brighter and that h@xmath44 becomes about thirty times brighter .",
    "we neglect opacity due to dust .",
    "dust is not associated with the highly ionized gas we are studying , and in any event it is unlikely that there is any significant dust formation at the high redshifts we are concerned with .",
    "for example , the average metallicities in the lyman - alpha forest at redshift @xmath55 are not much in excess of 0.01 solar ( songaila & cowie 1996 ) .",
    "more recent dust formation may obscure a cib , but we expect that the dust covers only a small fraction of the sky , so we neglect dust absorption in our calculation . in any event ,",
    "dust absorption can not erase a spectral feature , though it may decrease the total amplitude .",
    "we have attempted to extrapolate the emission rate to @xmath14 in several cases . as a simple exercise , we first neglect temperature evolution , thus fixing @xmath44 . if the bulk of the emission comes from bound objects , then @xmath56 . if the emission is coming from growing mode perturbations in the linear regime , then @xmath57 . finally , if the emission is coming from a uniform background , then @xmath58 .",
    "we use runs e and f to investigate the low redshift evolution . at late times , after reionization , the case a recombination rate varied as roughly @xmath59 in these simulations .",
    "the temperature in the predominant emission regions is thus rising .",
    "we use this result in extrapolating the higher resolution simulations to @xmath14 .",
    "the emission will be suppressed in the highest density regions due to the greatly increased temperature and thus greatly decreased recombination rate .",
    "we can make a simple argument to motivate this scale factor dependence .",
    "the overall temperature of the igm is around 10@xmath28 k. the recombination coefficient varies roughly as @xmath60 at temperatures of 10@xmath61 k. the temperature in a cluster can be 10@xmath62 or 10@xmath63 k. if a cluster is overdense by a factor of 10@xmath7 , the square of the density is up by 10@xmath61 .",
    "the temperature is up by a factor of roughly 10@xmath7 , and the total volume of gas is down by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "crudely , the cluster produces as much emission as the volume of igm from which it formed .",
    "if we assume unresolved clusters dominate the emission , we can then assign a power law evolution to the mean temperature of the igm today , which is as large as 10@xmath63 k. at redshift @xmath65 in the simulations , the temperature is 10@xmath28 k and today it is 10@xmath63 k , this means that the temperature rises like @xmath66 , so @xmath67 , and for clusters , which are bound objects , the total rate varies as @xmath68 .",
    "there are two quantities that we track at the reionization epoch , the space averaged recombination rate and the neutral hydrogen fraction . the hydrogen becomes ionized in roughly a tenth of a hubble time at a redshift of about @xmath69 , depending on the model .",
    "the recombination rate is at a maximum at this time , but the peak is quite broad . to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have plotted the recombination rate and the neutral hydrogen fraction together in figure   1 for simulation a. the other simulations have similar behavior .    in figure   2 we plot @xmath70 from recombinant emission from the first 20 levels of hydrogen for simulations a - d .",
    "the recombination rate has been extrapolated in the high resolution simulations from @xmath71 to @xmath14 according to a power law , @xmath72 where we have used @xmath73 , the fit obtained from simulations e and f. inspecting equation ( [ jnu ] ) we see that @xmath19 must fall more quickly than about @xmath74 at late times in the flat model being considered .",
    "if @xmath19 does not fall quickly enough , the spectrum is dominated by the most recent emission , and any feature from the reionization epoch is obscured .",
    "it is the absorption that gives the best indication of the redshift of the reionization event . before reionization",
    ", the optical depth in the lyman series is very high .",
    "all lyman series lines except ly@xmath44 are absorbed immediately and redistributed .",
    "this makes ly@xmath44 and the balmer series significantly brighter because they receive the energy of the lyman series .",
    "once reionization occurs , the lyman series becomes optically thin and the brightness of ly@xmath44 and the balmer series drops considerably .",
    "this is clearly seen in the spectrum .",
    "as we look redward , crossing ly@xmath44 at about one micron or h@xmath44 at about six microns from the reionization event , the brightness suddenly increases due to the effect of the absorption and redistribution of the higher lyman series lines .",
    "these features give a measurement of the redshift of the reionization event .",
    "the features are reasonably sharp , with @xmath75 .",
    "haiman , rees & loeb ( 1997 ) estimate a similar effect whereby radiative excitations serve to brighten ly@xmath44 .",
    "we find that recombinations give a significantly brighter signal .",
    "the recombination rate is proportional to the square of the gas density , and thus is sensitive to the clumpiness of the gas , while the excitation rate scales linearly with the gas density . in a hierarchically clustered universe",
    "we can expect that the recombination rate should be larger than the excitation rate .",
    "the positions of the broad maxima from the lyman and balmer series provide a check on the redshift of the sharp absorption features .",
    "these can also be used to relate the redshift of the reionization event to the evolution of the recombination rate .",
    "these can provide valuable information about the evolution of the ionizing background and the temperature evolution at the reionization epoch .",
    "these effects will be investigated in a future paper ( baltz , gnedin , & silk 1997 ) .",
    "this signature is quite weak , though it may be feasible to see some of these features in the near infrared , where dust emission is lowest . estimating the broadband intensity @xmath76 for spectra a - d at the position of the ly@xmath44 feature , we get results of @xmath77   nw   sr@xmath78   m@xmath79 . the signal is currently below observational upper limits by a factor of @xmath80 ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "1996b ) , but it may not be completely obscured according to theoretical models of the correlated component of the diffuse light from young galaxies ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "1996b , veeraraghavan 1996 ) .",
    "all of these predict that the broadband diffuse infrared light should be of the order of @xmath81   nw   sr@xmath78   m@xmath79 .",
    "the present model also predicts correlations in the diffuse light . in principle",
    "measuring these correlations can distinguish between reionization by stars and reionization by quasars , as the fluctuation length in the quasar scenario is much longer .",
    "there are two avenues which seem to greatly increase our chances of detecting these spectral features .",
    "the first is a spaceborne mission such as the egbirt or desire proposals ( mather & beichmann 1996 ) , which plan to put an infrared telescope at 3 au where the interplanetary dust scattering and emission is reduced by a factor of at least 100 .",
    "since such dust is the primary foreground , such a mission would be quite fruitful .",
    "the second involves measuring the anisotropy of the cib .",
    "it has been shown that while foregrounds are far brighter than any expected extragalactic infrared background , the extragalactic sources contribute most of the fluctuations at the degree scale down to the arcminute scale ( kashlinsky , mather & odenwald 1996a , kashlinsky et al .",
    "if it were possible to measure fluctuations on scales smaller than this , the recombinant emission should dominate due to its high redshift .",
    "in fact , the angular size of the simulation boxes at the reionization events are all on the order of a few seconds of arc .",
    "for example , in runs b and c the reionization event occurs at redshift @xmath82 .",
    "the comoving nonlinear scale at this time is 100 @xmath83 kpc .",
    "this region subtends @xmath84 today .",
    "any fluctuations at this scale should be produced at the reionization epoch , long before the arcminute scale fluctuations characteristic of galaxy formation .",
    "the spectra we have presented are only meant to be representative of what might be observed .",
    "there are large theoretical uncertainties concerning the reionization epoch , and we hope a measurement like the one described in this work can help to sort out the details of this important event in the history of structure formation .",
