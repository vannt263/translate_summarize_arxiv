    "most early studies on chimera states dealt with non - locally coupled phase oscillators , where coherence refers to phase- and frequency - locked oscillators and incoherence to drifting oscillators , respectively @xcite . lately , more and more chimera patterns were discovered , wherein coherence and incoherence is of a different nature .",
    "one example is a coupled - map chimera , where the individual elements consist of period - two orbits .",
    "the coexistence pattern is composed of two synchronous regions corresponding to the two realizations of the period - two orbit , with a spatially incoherent interfacial region , where the spatial arrangement of the two states appear in a random and thus incoherent manner@xcite . yet , each state remains a period-2 orbit in time and is thus either synchronized or anti - synchronized to any of the other elements , preserving temporal order .",
    "another example is the so - called amplitude chimera , where the incoherent group is characterized by disorder in the amplitude of the oscillators while all the oscillators in the entire ensemble oscillate with the same frequency@xcite .",
    "other coherence / incoherence coexistence patterns differ from the classical chimera state by the variability of coherent and incoherent regions , which might both change their sizes and move in space@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the stability properties of these diverse chimera states vary greatly .",
    "many chimeras , among them the original one in systems of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators , are transient for a finite number of oscillators , but have a diverging transient time in the continuum limit @xmath0@xcite .",
    "others are stable already from small ensemble sizes on @xcite , and still others have finite transient times even in the continuum limit@xcite .",
    "these examples illustrate that the original definition of a chimera state as `` a spatio - temporal pattern in which a system of identical oscillators is split into coexisting regions of coherent and incoherent oscillators''@xcite does not cope with recent developments but calls for a more distinct characterization and refinement .",
    "there already exist two approaches towards characterization schemes in minimal networks@xcite and for chimeras with non - local coupling@xcite , but they are both restricted to a small class of systems .",
    "in this paper we propose two measures for characterizing chimera states .",
    "although based on linear methods , these quantities provide what we believe to be a clear and simple definition of chimera states , and , furthermore , they allow for an easy distinction between chimera states with different coherence properties and thus provide a useful classification scheme .",
    "in addition , our approach is independent of the coupling scheme and the spatial dimension of the system , and not restricted to phase oscillators , such as the ( local ) kuramoto order parameter@xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we introduce a spatial and a temporal correlation measure applicable to arbitrary data sets and define chimera states with the help of these measures . in section iii , these criteria are applied to experimental and simulated data of different chimera states , and in section iv a detailed characterization scheme on the basis of the measures is discussed .",
    "details pertaining to the individual systems and to the numerical methods are given in the supplementary information ( si)@xcite .",
    "for systems with a spatial extent , that is , systems with a local or non - local coupling topology , we employ the local curvature as a measure for the spatial coherence .",
    "hereby the local curvature of the observable is quantified by the second derivative in one - dimension , or , more generally , by the laplacian for any number of spatial dimensions . therefore , we calculate the local curvature at each point in space by re - scaling and applying the discrete laplacian @xmath1 on each snapshot containing the spatial data @xmath2 . for one snapshot at time @xmath3 with one spatial dimension , this operation reads @xmath4 where each data point in @xmath2 can be either real , complex or of any higher dimension . in order to clarify this concept , consider the chimera state observed by kuramoto and battogtokh in a ring of non - locally coupled phase oscillators@xcite .",
    "one realization of the chimera state is depicted in figure [ fig:1]a .        through the application of the discrete laplace operator",
    ", this snapshot is mapped onto a new function as shown in figure [ fig:1]b , with @xmath5 indicating the maximal value of @xmath6 .",
    "note that for phase oscillator systems , we apply this operator on the data in the complex plane , that is the phase oscillators are located on a ring with constant amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "then , @xmath5 corresponds to the curvature at an oscillator whose two neighbors are shifted @xmath8 in phase , i.e. , whose neighboring oscillators are located on opposite positions on the circle . with the re - scaling obtained by multiplying the laplacian with @xmath9 in eq .",
    ", @xmath5 converges to @xmath10 in the continuum limit . in the synchronous regime latexmath:[$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty }    projected onto the x - axis through this transformation , while in the incoherent regime @xmath6 is finite and exhibits pronounced fluctuations .",
    "consequently , when we consider the normalized probability density function @xmath12 of @xmath6 , @xmath13 measures the relative size of spatially coherent regions in each temporal realization . for a fully synchronized system @xmath14 , while a totally incoherent system gives a value @xmath15 .",
    "a value between @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath13 indicates coexistence of synchrony and incoherence .",
    "given this discussion , two important aspects have to be considered .",
    "first , the definition of spatial coherence and incoherence is not absolute , but has to be compared to the maximal curvature in each system .",
    "thus , we argue that the characterization of coherence and incoherence is relative and depends on the individual system .",
    "second , even in the coherent region , there might be some minor change in state ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig:1]a above ) leading to a non - zero curvature .",
    "hence , we are convinced that in order to characterize something as coherent or incoherent , a threshold value is inevitable , although , as will be shown later , the exact position of the threshold does not change the qualitative outcome .",
    "considering the two arguments above , we propose that for spatially extended systems , a point for which the absolute local curvature is less than one percent of the maximum curvature present in the system should be characterized as coherent , and as incoherent otherwise .",
    "with the threshold @xmath18 our first correlation measure @xmath19 can be used to describe the spatial extent occupied by coherent oscillators , even for systems beyond coupled phase oscillators .",
    "an example of @xmath12 for the kuramoto model is shown in figure [ fig:2]a .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath12 is time dependent .",
    "figure [ fig:2]b shows @xmath20 as a function of time . the value of @xmath20 of about 0.3 confirms the interpretation of the state as a chimera state , while its time - independence reveals that the degree of coherence is stationary .     of the discrete laplace operator applied on the snapshot of figure [ fig:1]a .",
    "( b ) temporal evolution of @xmath21 for a longer time series of the kuramoto model . ]    for systems without a spatial dimension , i.e. , systems with solely global coupling , curvature is not defined .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that the pairwise euclidean distances between the values of all oscillators , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are a good measure for synchrony / asynchrony . again , from the normalized probability density function @xmath12 of @xmath24 , a variable @xmath25 can be obtained that is a measure for the relative amount of correlated oscillators . here",
    ", the square root arises due to the fact that by taking all pairwise distances , the probability of oscillators @xmath26 and @xmath27 both being in the synchronous cluster equals @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the number of the synchronous oscillators . since both measures , @xmath21 and @xmath30 , describe the same property , that is , the degree of spatial synchronization of the system , we only use @xmath21 as notation in the following .    as an illustration ,",
    "consider the two groups of globally coupled phase oscillators investigated by abrams et al@xcite .",
    "an exemplary snapshot is depicted in figure [ fig:3]a , where oscillators @xmath31 belong to group 1 and oscillators @xmath32 constitute group 2 .    .",
    "]    clearly , group 1 is synchronous while the oscillators in group 2 behave incoherently . in the parameter region",
    "considered , a breathing of the chimera as expressed through an oscillation of the variance of the incoherent cluster was reported@xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath21 is shown in figure [ fig:3]b .",
    "it can be observed that @xmath21 , i.e. , the relative amount of partially synchronized oscillators , evolves periodically and breathes over time .",
    "therefore , the temporal evolution of @xmath21 allows for the discrimination between chimeras with constant and oscillating partial synchronization .",
    "we term these _ stationary _ and _ breathing _ chimeras , respectively .",
    "the latter term has been adapted from the literature , since the kuramoto order parameter @xmath33 exhibits the qualitatively same temporal behavior as @xmath34@xcite .",
    "note that the two approaches above are independent of the spatial dimension and the number of variables of the different systems .",
    "this makes @xmath21 a versatile tool for the classification of multifaceted data sets such as those obtained from chimera states .",
    "in addition to the measure for the spatial correlation discussed in the previous section , the temporal correlation of the individual oscillators provides valuable information for a distinction between different chimera dynamics as well .",
    "suppose @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the real or complex time series of two individual oscillators with @xmath37 and @xmath38 their respective means and standard deviations .",
    "then , consider the pairwise correlation coefficients @xmath39 with @xmath40 indicating the temporal mean and @xmath41 complex conjugation . note that @xmath42 for linearly correlated time series , @xmath43 for linearly anti - correlated time series and @xmath44 for complex time series with a constant phase shift of @xmath45 .",
    "that means , the normalized distribution function @xmath46 of @xmath47 is a measure for the correlation in time . for static chimera states , where the coherent cluster is localized at the same position over time",
    ", @xmath48 is non - zero . in practice",
    ", we consider two oscillators as correlated if @xmath49 . as an example , consider the kuramoto model mentioned above .",
    "again , we map the system onto the complex plane with arbitrary constant amplitude @xmath7 for all oscillators . then , for the chimera state depicted in figure [ fig:4]a , we calculate the correlation matrix @xmath50 and its probability distribution function @xmath46 . the first row of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , is shown in figure [ fig:4]b .",
    "note that this approach maps the temporally coherent part onto 1 , cf .",

    "( b ) temporal evolution of @xmath21 and the value of @xmath54 , obtained from the same time interval .",
    "note that @xmath54 is not a function of time and is shown here only for comparison with @xmath21 . ]    [ fig:4b]a .",
    "it exhibits a distinct peak at @xmath55 , indicating that the chimera state is static , i.e. , that the majority of oscillators does not change its `` group affiliation '' .",
    "we suggest to term this kind of chimera state a _",
    "static _ chimera .",
    "the peak at @xmath56 arises due to the partial linear correlation between oscillators at @xmath57 and synchronous oscillators , cf .",
    "figure [ fig:4]b . the percentage of the time - correlated oscillators can now be quantified with @xmath58 e.g. @xmath59 for the kuramoto model , see figure [ fig:4b]b .",
    "note that @xmath54 does not always reflect the size of the synchronized cluster .",
    "this is especially the case when coherent and incoherent regimes are non - static and perform spatial movements over time .",
    "then , @xmath54 is much smaller than @xmath21 and may vanish for large enough time windows . @xmath54 coincides with @xmath34 , cf .",
    "figure [ fig:4b]b , if and only if the chimera is static and no spatial coherence is present in the incoherent cluster .",
    "as shown in the previous section , @xmath21 of the kuramoto model remains constant in time and , in addition , coincides with @xmath54 .",
    "this indicates the constant phase relation between the coherent and incoherent part and their spatial stationarity in time .",
    "the same qualitative behavior can be observed in many different non - locally coupled dynamical systems , such as in non - locally coupled stuart - landau oscillators investigated by bordyugov et al.@xcite and in chimera states observed by sethia and sen in a non - locally coupled version of the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle)@xcite . a snapshot and the observables @xmath21 and @xmath54 of the latter are depicted in figure [ fig:5]a and b , respectively .     and @xmath54 of the amplitude - mediated chimera state .",

    "static _ chimera .",
    "moreover , the finite values of @xmath21 and @xmath54 indicate that the desynchronized dynamics are both _ spatially _ and _ temporally _ incoherent .",
    "an example of a static chimera state not exhibiting temporal incoherence was examined by omelchenko et al . in a system of",
    "non - locally coupled maps with a period-2 orbit@xcite , and subsequently experimentally realized in ref .",

    "the value of @xmath21 between 0 and 1 affirms that we are dealing with a chimera state , while the fact that @xmath60 attests to the absence of any temporal incoherence .",

    "[ fig:7]b , the oscillatory behavior of @xmath21 is evident , indicating partial synchronization also in the incoherent regime .",
    "note that within the incoherent cluster , there are always homogeneous patches , leading to the offset between @xmath21 and @xmath54 .    besides oscillating in time ,",
    "the observable @xmath21 can also vary irregularly .",

    "note that @xmath54 is significantly larger than 0 , indicating that the chimera state is static .",
    "the irregularity in @xmath21 arises from spatio - temporal intermittency , which appears spontaneously in the turbulent regime , leading to the emergence of patches of oscillators that are synchronous with the coherent region and shrink and disappear with time .    .",
    "( b ) @xmath21 and @xmath54 calculated from the data shown in ( a ) . ]    non - stationary chimera states with irregular phase boundaries were also reported by bordyugov et al.@xcite , who named this state a _ turbulent _ chimera .",
    "we adapt this expression for general chimera states with irregular variation of the partial synchronization , @xmath21 .",

    "and @xmath54 calculated from the data shown in ( a ) . ]    a realization of the spatio - temporal intermittency in the one - dimensional cgle is shown in figure [ fig:9]a . in figure",
    "[ fig:9]b , the irregular evolution of @xmath21 is apparent .",
    "however , in contrast to the type i chimera discussed above , @xmath21 drops to zero at different points in time .",
    "this means that the coherent part , and with it the coexistence between synchrony and incoherence , vanishes completely from time to time .",
    "therefore , spatio - temporal intermittency should not be considered to represent a chimera state .",
    "@xmath54 is also small ( @xmath62 ) , and results from the correlation of neighboring points due to diffusion .",
    "dynamics with reversed roles , that is turbulent patches appearing in an otherwise homogeneous regime , are found in the cgle with linear@xcite and non - linear global coupling@xcite and is called localized turbulence .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig:9b ] , with a snapshot of the modulus of a two - dimensional simulation in ( a ) and the temporal evolution of a one - dimensional cut in ( b ) .     with @xmath63 , si section vi@xcite .",

    "the fluctuating value of @xmath21 suggests that the degree of coherence changes with time .",
    "a strong increase of the synchronous part occurs at @xmath65 , indicating a strong non - stationarity .",

    "an illustration is depicted in figure [ fig:9c]b , where @xmath21 was calculated from two - dimensional simulations of systems with @xmath66 .",
    "a characteristic feature of localized turbulence , as compared to all chimera states discussed above , is that the turbulent islands are composed of several incoherent `` bubble - like '' structures , which move erratically in the spatial domain .",
    "bubbles disappear or pop up through division of existing bubbles . due to this steady motion of the turbulent islands ,",
    "the fraction of the coherent time series , as measured by @xmath54 is small , and vanishes if the time window is chosen large enough .",
    "the same holds for the alternating chimeras observed by haugland et al.@xcite , where the turbulent part alternates with the homogeneous regime in time ( not shown ) .     and",
    "@xmath54 of the localized turbulence with @xmath63 .",
    "( b ) @xmath21 and @xmath54 of the localized turbulence with domain length @xmath66 . ]",
    "so far , we did not consider the long - term stability of the chimera states yet .",
    "however , especially in the context of chimera states , defining a stability concept is an important issue . while various chimera states , as the type i and type ii chimeras mentioned above , are the only attractors for a specific parameter region , and as such are stable , many other chimera states including those of the kuramoto model , are long - term transients with infinite transient time in the continuum limit @xmath67@xcite .",
    "then , there exist states encompassing coexistence of coherence and incoherence that collapse to the homogeneous state after a finite time even for @xmath67 .",
    "an example thereof is the so - called amplitude chimera@xcite .",
    "the space - time realization of such a state is depicted in figure [ fig:10]a , figure [ fig:10]b showing the evolution of @xmath21 .",
    "amplitude chimeras resemble the chimeras found in coupled period-2 maps ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] ) insofar as they are composed of two coherent domains with anti - phase behavior that are separated by a spatially incoherent interfacial region . in the latter region , the absolute values of the amplitudes vary erratically in space but each oscillator is strictly periodic with a frequency equal to the frequency of the synchronous regions .",
    "the spatial incoherence renders @xmath21 smaller than 1 .",
    "however , as investigated in detail by loos et al.@xcite and also evident from figure [ fig:10 ] , the chimera - like dynamics are not stable . a transition to full synchronization",
    "can be observed , i.e. @xmath68 after a finite time interval . in this case , the lifetime of the chimera state strongly depends on the choice of the initial conditions and asymptotically approaches a constant value in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "we consider it meaningful to discriminate between transient chimeras and chimera states which are attractive in the continuum limit .",
    "therefore we suggest to introduce a separate class _ transient _ chimeras for states with @xmath69 and @xmath70 at some transient time @xmath71 .    , of the so - called amplitude chimera observed by zakharova et al@xcite , si section viii@xcite .",
    "( b ) @xmath21 of the chimera shown in ( a ) . ]    another remarkable case that created controversy as to its characterization as a chimera was reported by falcke and engel in a globally coupled version of the co - oxidation model@xcite . there",
    ", turbulent patches appeared in an otherwise homogeneously oscillating background , similar to the localized turbulence discussed above .",
    "but , in contrast to the behavior in the localized turbulence , no turbulent bubbles ever disappear .",
    "a one - dimensional simulation is depicted in [ fig:11]a , with the corresponding measure @xmath21 plotted in [ fig:11]b .    , si section ix@xcite .",
    "( b ) @xmath21 of the dynamics shown in ( a ) . ]    there , the incoherent region expands into the synchronously oscillating domains with an approximately constant velocity that is strongly dependent on the diffusion coefficient @xmath72 .",
    "this non - stationarity manifests itself in the overall systematically declining behavior of @xmath21 .",
    "in such a case a longer simulation time is necessary in order to verify that @xmath21 vanishes after a finite time interval , which was confirmed for the present case .",
    "since it mediates a transition from an unstable to a stable state , it fulfills the above defined criteria for a _ transient _ chimera state .",
    "we thus classify it accordingly .",

    "figure [ fig:13]a shows the pairwise correlation coefficients of the cross - section with a point inside the coherent cluster ( here @xmath75 ) : a strong linear correlation within this cluster and the diminishing correlation with the remaining oscillators is evident .        in figure [ fig:13]b , the behavior of @xmath21 with time and the value of @xmath54 are shown .",
    "they are remarkably similar to the type ii dynamics as depicted in figure [ fig:7 ] .",
    "hence we can conclude that the observed experimental chimera is of the _ breathing _ type .",
    "the smallness of @xmath54 originates from the fact that the coherent cluster is relatively small .",
    "above , we introduced two correlation measures , @xmath21 and @xmath54 , which allow a quantification of coherence and incoherence in dynamical systems . for phase oscillators",
    ", the local kuramoto order parameter already quantifies the degree of incoherence as a function of space and time .",
    "in contrast , our global measure @xmath21 yields information about the total relative sizes of the coherent and incoherent parts of the system , but does not contain information about local properties within the incoherent group .",
    "nevertheless , it exhibits distinct qualitative types of temporal behavior for chimera states with visibly different dynamic features , and thus , like the local order parameter , can be used to discriminate between chimeras , transient chimeras and other types of dynamics .",
    "its main advantage is its unrestricted applicability , not only to ensembles of phase oscillators , but to any type of dynamical system .",
    "thus , @xmath21 allows for a simple and straightforward classification of general chimera states .    for @xmath21",
    "equal to @xmath16 or @xmath17 , one of the two phases , the coherent ( @xmath76 ) or incoherent one ( @xmath68 ) , does not exist .",

    "this includes spatio - temporal intermittency , the turbulent patterns in the co model and the amplitude - chimeras shown in figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "yet , for the latter two , @xmath77 is valid for a long time interval .",
    "therefore , we suggest that these states are categorized as _ transient _ chimeras . in the case of intermittency , @xmath21 fluctuates constantly , thereby attaining a value of 0 after arbitrary periods of time .",

    "we have introduced two observables , @xmath21 and @xmath54 , that are a measure for the degree of spatial and temporal coherence , respectively , and allow for a discrimination between different types of chimeras from simulated or experimental spatio - temporal data sets .",

    "<S> we present a universal characterization scheme for chimera states applicable to both numerical and experimental data sets . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is based on two correlation measures that enable a meaningful definition of chimera states as well as their classification into three categories : _ stationary _ , _ turbulent _ and _ breathing_. in addition , these categories can be further subdivided according to the time - stationarity of these two measures . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this approach both is consistent with previously recognized chimera states and enables us to classify states as chimeras which have not been categorized as such before . </S>",

    "<S> the discovery that an array of identical oscillators , all coupled in an identical way to their neighbors , can also be split into synchronized and drifting groups was likewise surprising as fundamental . </S>",
    "<S> the chimera state , being a novel type of dynamic state , can broaden our understanding of transitions from synchrony to `` turbulence '' and vice versa , and has possible realizations and applications in nature , e.g. in neuroscience@xcite or hydrodynamics@xcite . since the pioneering works in the early years of this millennium , chimera states have been observed in many different systems , ranging from systems with non - local coupling@xcite , via two - group approximations@xcite to global all - to - all coupling@xcite . due to their robustness to noise , </S>",
    "<S> chimera states have also been observed experimentally , e.g. in networks of coupled chemical oscillators@xcite , arrays of coupled spatial light modulators@xcite , networks of mechanical oscillators@xcite and electrochemical systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the various systems differ strongly in the visual attributes of their dynamic behavior , asking for a systematic categorization . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a classification scheme based on linear methods , which we believe fulfills the requirements of being universal and simple in its application . </S>",
