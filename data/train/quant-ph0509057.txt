    "we assume that alice and bob can perform arbitrary local operations ( lo ) on their subsystems , including unitary actions and , possibly , generalized measurements involving extra ancilla particles .",
    "if necessary , alice and bob can exchange classical communication ( cc ) but global quantum operations involving subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 are forbidden .",
    "the resulting set of allowed operations is generally referred to as locc . when alice and bob share entanglement , local actions on a given region have a _ non - local _ effect , in the sense that the state of the remote particle does not necessarily remain insensitive to the details of the transformation performed miles away .",
    "consider the case of a projective measurement on alice s side .",
    "for example , she performs a stern - gerlach measurement with the apparatus oriented along an arbitrary unit vector @xmath3 .",
    "let us call @xmath4 , the eigenvector corresponding to spin up along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "whenever she records a spin up result , the joint state of the system is projected out into the product state @xmath5 , if she records a spin down result , the joint state of the system is projected out into the product state @xmath6 .",
    "both outcomes happen with equal probability .",
    "= 6.7 cm    now there are two distinctly different ways to proceed .",
    "if bob were to conduct an independent measurement on his particles using an stern - gerlach apparatus with a random orientation , then he will also register a random outcome , obtaining an unbiased spin up and spin down distribution along his chosen direction .",
    "there will be no correlations between his measurement outcomes and those of alice .",
    "if however , bob receives a message from alice informing him of her choice of alignment , then the situation changes in a subtle way .",
    "his measurement will still give random outcomes , but , these outcomes will be perfectly correlated to those of alice s measurement outcomes .",
    "this shows that classical communication may be used to correlate actions between partners with the effect that experimental results will change significantly . in a more complicated setting alice and bob",
    "would perform measurements along various non - parallel but correlated axes .",
    "this type of correlated measurements then leads to the celebrated epr paradox , later formulated by bell in a testable form and which for years fuelled the discussions about quantum non - locality @xcite .",
    "the recent development of the theory of quantum information processing has given an unexpected twist to this discussion .",
    "shared entanglement supplement by locc operations makes possible entirely new forms of distributed computation and communication @xcite , as epitomized by the process of quantum state teleportation @xcite . in this article",
    "we will focus on a related problem : the remote implementation of quantum operations , and in particular , the teleportation of unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation has been illustrated pictorially in figure 1 .",
    "one of the remote partners , alice , has access to a classical device that can implement an arbitrary singe - particle operation @xmath7 .",
    "there is no need to restrict the dimensionality of the space of allowed operations except for assuming that it be finite , but possibly very large ( see section i for specific details )",
    ". using locc operations , and provided that alice and bob share entanglement , represented by the state @xmath8 in the figure , our aim is to remotely implement the arbitrary transformation @xmath7 on bob s side , i.e. , to design an locc protocol that will end up with bob holding the state @xmath9 for any single particle state @xmath10 .",
    "when we allow for a completely arbitrary @xmath7 then we will show that the most economical procedure to achieve this consist of teleporting the state of bob s particle to alice , who applies the transformation @xmath7 to the teleported state and then teleports the state back to bob .",
    "no other locc protocol supplemented by shared entanglement will consume less distributed entanglement and have a lower communication cost .",
    "however , when the requirement of perfect remote control for arbitrary operations is relaxed , we encounter a different situation and state teleportation is no longer the most cost - efficient way to proceed when implementing restricted sets of operations .",
    "non - trivial protocols become possible and we present examples for these in the special case of unitary transformations on two - level systems ( qubits ) .",
    "we have organized the presentation as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a general proof for the necessary and sufficient resources required for the remote control of a single qudit operation .",
    "this results generalize previous constraints derived for qubits @xcite .",
    "section iii analyzes the limitations arising when one attempts to teleport restricted sets of operations .",
    "we will show that arbitrary qubit rotations around a fixed direction can be implemented remotely without the need of teleporting states between alice and bob .",
    "novel results concerning the remote control of identical copies are discussed in iii.a .",
    "recent experimental reports demonstrating the protocol are summarized in section vi .",
    "the final section summarizes our main results and conclusions .",
    "the most general scenario for the teleportation of an arbitrary unitary operation was discussed in @xcite and is related to the design of universal quantum gates arrays proposed by nielsen and chuang @xcite .",
    "when the device implementing the unitary transformation @xmath7 is modelled as a truly quantum system , whose state corresponding to the unitary operation _",
    "u _ will be denoted by @xmath11 , we can represent the remote control operator by a completely positive , linear , trace preserving map on the set of density operators for the combined system .",

    "this can indeed be done in any of the instances that we are considering in the following .",
    "= 8.7 cm    the results by nielsen and chuang on programmable gate arrays @xcite imply that the control states @xmath15 corresponding to different unitary transformations are orthogonal , so that no finite - dimensional control system can be used to teleport an arbitrary unitary operation .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , when we speak of an arbitrary unitary operation , we will mean one which belongs to some arbitrarily large , but finite , set .",
    "we will also assume that this set contains the identity @xmath16 and the 3 pauli operators @xmath17 .",
    "the orthogonality of the control states opens the possibility that different operations can , at least in principle , be distinguished and identified by alice if she chooses to perform measurements on the apparatus . here",
    "we are not interested in this approach and focused instead in assisting the task with shared entangled and locc operations @xcite .    within this very general formulation ,",
    "it is possible to derive lower bounds on the amount of non - local resources that are needed to implement @xmath18 using only local operations and classical communication . to this end",
    ", we should remember the following basic principles @xcite + * ( a ) * _ the amount of classical information able to be communicated by an operation in a given direction across some partition between subsystems can not exceed the amount of information that must be sent in this direction across the same partition to complete the operation _",
    "( impossibility of super - luminal communication ) . + * ( b ) * _ the amount of bipartite entanglement that an operation can establish across some partition between subsystems can not exceed the amount of prior entanglement across the partition that must be consumed in order to complete the operation_(impossibility of increasing entanglement under locc ) .",
    "+ principle ( a ) allows us to establish the fact that at least two classical bits must be sent from alice to bob to complete the teleportation of an arbitrary _ u_. moreover , by teleporting an arbitrary _ u _ according to the general prescription in eq .",
    "( [ tony ] ) , alice and bob can establish 2 ebits of shared entanglement and it follows from principle ( b ) that at least 2 ebits of entanglement need to be consumed to implement @xmath18 locally , i.e. to teleport an arbitrary unitary operation @xcite .",
    "these bounds can be attained by a procedure in which bob teleports the state of his particle to alice who , after applying the unitary transformation , teleports it back to him ( bidirectional state teleportation ) .",
    "this scheme saturates the lower bounds for the amount of shared ebits and classical bits transmitted from alice to bob and additionally uses two bits of classical communication from bob to alice and allows the faithful implementation of @xmath7 independently of the dimension of the control system . to be more efficient overall",
    ", any other scheme would need less resources than bidirectional state teleportation .",
    "this establishes an upper bound in the overall amount of resources required for the efficient remote implementation of an arbitrary @xmath7 as 4 classical bits and 2 ebits .",
    "note that it would also be conceivable to adopt a different strategy  teleporting the state of the control system from alice to bob who would then implement the control directly onto qubit @xmath19 .",
    "we call this the `` control - state teleportation '' scheme .",
    "control - state teleportation is a unidirectional communication scheme from alice to bob , so the absolute lower bound for the communication exchange from bob to alice is zero .",
    "obviously , the overall resources will depend on the dimensionality of the control system @xmath20 and in general a large amount of entanglement and classical communication from alice to bob will be required if we want to teleport the control system .",
    "let us focus on the experimental scenario where the black box implementing an arbitrary transformation @xmath7 is a macroscopic object , involving a ( very ) large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the option of teleporting the control apparatus is then unfeasible , given that it would consume an unrealistic amount of entanglement and classical communication resources .",
    "however , the question remains whether there exists a more economical protocol than bidirectional state teleportation .",
    "we will generalize in the following the results presented in @xcite and show that bidirectional state teleportation is an unconditional optimal way to remotely implement an arbitrary @xmath7 on a given @xmath21-level system ( qudit ) .",

    "for instance , the transformation @xmath26 can represent a state teleportation operation . in the following",
    "we prove , for systems of arbitrary spatial dimensions , that this is necessarily the case and that the only way that eq .",
    "( [ doble ] ) can be implemented ( locally ) is by teleporting the state @xmath27 from bob to alice , and then teleporting back the transformed state @xmath28 from alice to bob .    by linearity",

    "u _ @xcite . with this",
    "we can already show that the operation @xmath23 can not be trivial .",
    "we do this by first assuming the contrary that @xmath30 , and considering two input states , @xmath10 and @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , and two unitary transformations @xmath7 and @xmath33 which bring these two states to the same state @xmath34 . using eq .",

    "equivalently , @xmath49 in other words , the operation @xmath23 necessarily transfers bob s state @xmath50 to alice s qubit @xmath25 . substituting eq .",

    "( [ doble ] ) then shows that @xmath24 necessarily transfers @xmath51 back to bob s qubit @xmath52 .",

    "this results is tantamount to a no - go theorem : _ a local unitary operation @xmath7 can not act remotely .",
    "_ from this and the fact that quantum state teleportation is an optimal procedure for local state transfer , we conclude that the optimal locc procedure supplemented by shared entanglement for implementing remotely an arbitrary unitary action @xmath7 on a qudit is by means of bidirectional state teleportation .",
    "in the specific case of qubits , the results presented in the previous section show that if we want the transformation @xmath7 to be an arbitrary element of the group @xmath53 , no locc protocol can exist consuming less overall resources than teleporting bob s state to alice followed by alice teleporting the state transformed by @xmath7 back to bob .",
    "this amounts to two e - bits of entanglement and two classical bit in each direction .",
    "the ultimate reason for this result can be found in the linearity of quantum mechanics and the impossibility of implementing remotely an arbitrary @xmath7 without resorting to state transfer belongs to the family of no - go results imposed by the linear structure of quantum mechanics such as the non - cloning theorem @xcite .",

    "the physical principles of non - increase of entanglement under locc and the impossibility of super - luminal communication allow us to establish lower bounds in the resources required for teleporting an unknown quantum operation on a qubit .",
    "at least two e - bits of entanglement have to be consumed and , in addition , this quantum channel has to be supplemented by a _ two way _ classical communication channel which , in principle , could be non - symmetric . while consistency with causality requires two classical bits being transmitted from alice to bob , the lower bound for the amount of classical information transmitted from bob to alice has been found to be one bit .",

    ", the final state after the action of the net quantum operation , including dephasing , representing the remote rotation protocol is given by @xmath134 here , to completely characterize the remote operation @xmath135 in our experiment , four states @xmath136 are used as an input for the initial state of bob s polarization qubit . with the four output density matrices , the @xmath128 obtained in the process can then be reconstructed using techniques for quantum process tomography @xcite . for the @xmath137-rotation @xmath138",

    "[ results ] for the case of an ideal rotation @xmath139 , a dephased rotation @xmath146 , and the effective operation @xmath147 obtained in our experiment , where the left six histograms are the real parts for the matrices for @xmath148 and @xmath149 rotation through @xmath59 axis , and the right for the imaginary ones , where the values of the parameter @xmath150 was measured to be @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "new non - zero elements are found in the effective @xmath153 .",
    "this is introduced by the imperfection of the polarization beam - splitter .",

    "although only a rotation commuting with @xmath161 ( @xmath59-rotation ) is operated in our experiment , the same protocol can be implemented for operations anti - commuting with @xmath137 ( @xmath162-rotation ) with another hwp at @xmath163 at the output port , which acts as a @xmath161 operation .",
    "the above scheme can also be generalised to implementing controlled operations which commute or anti - commute with @xmath137 .",
    "for example , the control - phase gate commutes with @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "an experiment along these lines , where a non - local cnot was implemented using linear optics , was reported in @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we have implemented a remote rotation by @xmath167 about the @xmath59 axis on a photonic qubit using shared entanglement and local operations and without performing the rotation directly on the target photons .",
    "the whole process was characterized using quantum process tomography and the results agree with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the scheme can be generalized to implement remotely any operation belonging to the two classes that allow for protocols different from bidirectional state teleportation @xcite .",
    "the linearity of quantum mechanics imposes severe constraints on the type of protocols that can be implemented by quantum mechanical means . when combining these constraints with those of locality , one arrives at interesting no - go theorems concerning quantum protocols between spatially separated parties . in this work",
    "we have investigated such questions both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "in particular , we have considered the possibility of the remote implementation of unitary transformations .",
    "if alice holds a tool that allows for the implementation of a unitary transformation we consider the question whether entanglement and classical communication is sufficient to allow this unitary transformation be applied to an unknown state of a particle held by bob .",
    "we have considered several scenarios and , employing linearity , the non - increase of entanglement under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) as well as the no - signalling condition , several no - go theorems were derived and discussed .",
    "we have also identified situations with restricted sets of operations in which the remote application of unitaries can be achieved in a non - trivial way , that is , avoiding state teleportation . despite their theoretical nature , the results of this work have led to an effort towards the implementation of such protocols and we have described the successful implementation of one of the theoretical protocols that has been developed in this paper .",
    "it is hoped that these results illuminate further how fundamental properties of quantum mechanics impose constraints via linearity , locality and no - signalling but also facilitate new opportunities in the form of generalized measurements and entanglement supplemented by classical communication .",
    "the use of multipartite entanglement , as discussed in section iii.a , opens up a new front and further applications for quantum communication are foreseeable .",
