    "again , we note that we focus solely on interpreting the broad emission and absorption features of he that arise in the stellar winds and wwirs , and not the narrower ( @xmath15  50  ) features that form in the weigelt blobs and other dense , slow - moving near - equatorial circumstellar ejecta @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",

    "we briefly describe only the key aspects and differences that are directly relevant to this work .    due to the high eccentricity of the @xmath2  carsystem ( @xmath0 ) , as the stars approach periastron , both the 3d structure and dynamical evolution of the individual stellar winds and wwir change drastically , compared to the majority of the orbital period .",
    "the stellar separation drops to @xmath14  1.5  au and orbital speeds increase greatly , becoming comparable to the wind speed of @xmath5(see section  [ sec : results ] for details ) .",
    "the rapid orbital motion during periastron thus leads to major changes in the structure of the winds and wwir on relatively short time - scales of the order of a few days ( @xcite ; ) .    to properly resolve this complex situation , we use two different sph simulation domain sizes from .",
    "the larger domain is the same as the one used in ( @xmath19  au , where @xmath20  @xmath21  15.45  au is the length of the orbital semimajor axis ) , and allows for a direct comparison of the results in this paper with those at apastron in .",
    "the smaller domain simulations have a computational domain radius @xmath22  au and eight times the number of sph particles used in the @xmath23 simulations , leading to a roughly factor of two improvement in the overall spatial resolution compared to the @xmath23 simulations .",
    "the high - resolution simulations focus only on phases around periastron ( @xmath241.03 , where by convention , @xmath25 , is defined as periastron , and @xmath26 , is defined as apastron ) , with output written every @xmath27 , which is approximately every 1.6  days of the 2024-day orbit .",
    "these smaller , higher - resolution simulations ensure that we are adequately resolving the stellar winds and wwir directly between the stars , as well as any possible wwir ` collapse ' that may affect the escape of @xmath1 s ionizing radiation . the higher resolution @xmath28 simulations are also useful for checking the accuracy of the @xmath23 results .",
    "we consider the ionization of hydrogen and helium atoms by both collisional- and photoionization , and assume the same abundance by number of he relative to h as @xcite , @xmath29 .",
    "we employ a single photoionizing source located at the position of @xmath1 . as in , we consider @xmath1to be an o5 giant with @xmath30  k , we assume a total ionizing flux for h and he of photons @xcite , and we use three bins to sample the stellar spectrum , which we approximate with a black body .",
    "the bin edges of each frequency bin are set by the ionization energy of each species .",
    "the first bin ranges from the ionization frequency of ( =  hz ) to that of ( =  hz ) , the second from to (  hz ) , and the third from to a maximum frequency equal to ten times .",

    "we do not include the inner zone in @xmath5 s wind in the @xmath23 simulations since it is of negligible size ( @xmath37  au ) , and because @xmath1produces essentially zero -ionizing photons .",
    "due to their smaller domain size , for added accuracy , the 23  au simulations do include the structure in @xmath5 s innermost wind ( @xmath36  0.7  au for case  a , and @xmath14  0.8  au for case  b ) .    as discussed in",

    "therefore , we focus in this paper on simulation cases  a and b , which represent the most likely values of @xmath5 s current mass loss rate . moreover , little information would be obtained by including case  c since for such a low mass loss rate @xmath5already singly - ionizes he throughout the entire computational domain in the @xmath28 simulations , and nearly the entire domain ( out to @xmath38  au ) in the @xmath23 simulations .",
    "finally , we note that we use a standard cartesian coordinate system with the origin located at the system centre of mass and the orbital plane set in the @xmath39 plane , with the major axis along the @xmath40-axis . the stars orbit counterclockwise if viewed from along the @xmath41-axis . in this system of reference , at periastron ,",
    "@xmath5is to the right and @xmath1is to the left .      as in , we",
    "post - process the sph simulation output .",
    "this approach works well for the @xmath2  carsystem at apastron , when the ionization state reaches an equilibrium value on a time - scale much shorter than the orbital time - scale .",
    "more importantly , at apastron , the @xmath1wind cavity is an almost axisymmetric cone , allowing @xmath1 s ionizing photons to completely ionize the low - density secondary wind .",
    "in other words , it is reasonable at apastron to assume that knowledge of the ionization structure of the preceding sph timestep is not required for accurate rt results .    in this paper , however , we deal with phases at periastron where , due to rapid orbital motion , the interacting wind structures evolve on a time - scale comparable to the time necessary for the rt simulations to reach a stable ionization state .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1wind cavity at periastron is strongly asymmetrical and distorted .",
    "regions that were ionized by @xmath1 in an earlier snapshot may not be reachable by @xmath1 s photons in the next snapshot . to tackle these issues",
    ", we use a slightly different approach than that in .    using collisional ionization equilibrium , the results of , and estimates for the recombination time of as a function of gas density and temperature , we are able to better constrain the initial ionization state of the gas for use as an initial condition in our periastron simplexsimulations . we know that in the cooler ( @xmath42  k ) unshocked gas in the @xmath1wind on the apastron side of the system is completely photoionized by @xmath1during most of the binary orbit around apastron .",
    "observations with the _ hubble space telescope_/space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ hst_/stis ) show that numerous high - ionization lines that require @xmath1 s ionizing flux are present for most of the orbit and do not start to fade until phase @xmath43 ( approximately one month before periastron , @xcite ; ) .",
    "therefore , we can safely assume that @xmath1is able to completely ionize throughout its unshocked wind at least until @xmath44 ( and at least for the length scales of interest here , @xmath45",
    "au from the stars , since the _ hst _ observations show ionized structures extending several thousand au from the stars ) .",
    "after @xmath44 , @xmath1becomes deeply embedded in the dense wind of @xmath5and the wwir becomes so distorted by orbital motion that we can no longer assume that @xmath1can efficiently ionize throughout its entire cool unshocked wind . if the he in the low - density ( @xmath46  ) unshocked @xmath1gas is no longer photoionized by the star , then , at @xmath47  k , should recombine on a time - scale @xmath48  days ( or longer ) .",
    "thus , around periastron , for gas with @xmath42  k and @xmath49  , the recombination time - scale for is about an order of magnitude larger than the orbital time - scale .",
    "any gas that recombines very slowly compared to the orbital time - scale around periastron poses a potential problem for the accuracy of our rt simulations , mainly because we are post - processing the sph simulation output .",
    "the sph output contains no information about the previous ionization state of the gas before we start our simplexsimulations .",
    "however , any gas with a low enough recombination rate should remain ionized from one snapshot to the next , even though @xmath1photons no longer reach that material .",
    "therefore , we should preserve the ionization state of low - recombination - rate gas in the initial condition of our rt simulations .",
    "the time difference between @xmath50 and periastron is @xmath7  30  days .",
    "the recombination time for gas with @xmath42  k and @xmath49   is about two weeks longer than this .",
    "lower - density gas at @xmath42  k will have even longer recombination times . if we assume that the @xmath1ionizing flux becomes trapped by @xmath5 s dense wind and the wwir at @xmath44 , then at periastron , any such low - recombination - rate gas that was initially photoionized by @xmath1at @xmath44 should still be ionized .    therefore , to mimic the fact that the low - density , cool @xmath1wind on the apastron side of the system should remain ionized at periastron",
    ", we set the he fractions in the @xmath1wind material with @xmath51   and @xmath52  k to be @xmath14  97% .",
    "this should generate an initial condition closer to the previous ionization state of the photoionized @xmath1gas , since for gas with @xmath51   and @xmath52  k , the recombination time - scale is @xmath7  4  days or longer .",
    "the use of collisional ionization equilibrium as an initial condition for the remaining gas remains a valid approximation even around periastron , since for the pre- and post - shock @xmath5wind , the high densities allow the gas to recombine almost instantaneously",
    ". hot ( @xmath53  k ) gas in the post - shock @xmath1wind is collisionally ionized to or higher .    due to the shorter dynamical time - scales around periastron , which alter the gas distribution from snapshot to snapshot",
    ", we must also run simplexfor a much shorter simulation time , compared to that used at apastron in . in our simulation testing",
    "we find that , setting the initial condition of the gas as described above , in case  a , the ionization state reaches an equilibrium value in less than one day . in case",
    "b , the gas reaches ionization equilibrium in @xmath14  23  days .",
    "since significant changes to the gas density and temperature distributions around periastron also occur on a time - scale of @xmath14  23  days , we use a total rt simulation time of 2.5  days and a simulation time - step of @xmath54  minutes in order to achieve an accurate rt calculation of the ionization volumes and fractions . at these time - scales , the gas distribution , even around periastron , can be assumed to be roughly constant .",
    "to help the reader better understand the rt results , we first briefly describe the density and temperature structure in the @xmath39 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 planes . for more details on the hydrodynamical simulation results , see .",

    "combined with the effects of radiative inhibition by @xmath5 , this leads to a significant slowing of @xmath1 s pre - shock wind , which alters the wind momentum ratio at the wwir .",
    "this decreases the wwir opening angle and moves the wwir apex closer to @xmath1 .",
    "this behaviour occurs in the case  b simulations in figs .",
    "[ fig : caseb_medium_dens_temp ] and [ fig : caseb_small_dens_temp ] as well , although lowering further increases the wwir opening angle and moves the wwir apex closer to @xmath5 .",
    "the above effects create a high asymmetry between the trailing and leading arms of the wwir at periastron , as @xmath1becomes deeply embedded in @xmath5 s dense inner wind .",

    "this has a strong impact on the location of the shock - heated gas . as shown in the bottom left panel of figs .",
    "[ fig : casea_small_dens_temp ] and [ fig : caseb_small_dens_temp ] , the post - shock secondary wind is heated to temperatures higher than  k only where the @xmath1wind collides with the highly distorted leading arm of the wwir ( in red ) . the trailing wind of @xmath1is unable to collide with @xmath5 s downstream wind , and so there is no hot shocked gas there .",
    "this effect is also visible in the bottom left panel of figs .",
    "[ fig : casea_medium_dens_temp ] and [ fig : caseb_medium_dens_temp ] .",

    "similar to the case at apastron , @xmath1ionizing photons create different structures depending on the value of . in case  a , the -ionizing photons are only able to ionize a thin layer within the leading arm of the wwir , and a rather small volume of the diffuse @xmath5wind that is expanding into the @xmath1wind cavity located near the remnant of the wwir s trailing arm ( first row of fig .",

    "the on the apastron side of the system is a combination of ongoing photoionization and previously ionized gas which is slowly recombining .",

    "[ fig : caseb_xy ] ) .",
    "from the discussions in sections  [ sec : method ] and [ sec : results ] , it is evident that the interpretation of the results at periastron is much more difficult then at apastron , especially in terms of trying to understand how the results relate to observations of the various he line profiles @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can use our results to try to better constrain the regions where the he emission and absorption features are generated .",

    "we note that spectroscopic phase , defined by e.g. the disappearance of the narrow component of the lines ( @xcite , or alternatively , the minimum in the observed x - ray light curve , @xcite ) , may differ from true orbital phase by up to one month .",
    "our results show that , at periastron , @xmath1is able to singly - ionize he in only a very thin layer of the post - shock @xmath5wind along the wwir leading arm , and a very small region close to the stars .",
    "the denser @xmath5wind , expanding into the secondary wind cavity , is effectively able to stop the -ionizing photons .",
    "therefore , the lower - density receding secondary wind on the apastron side and the adiabatically - cooling trailing arm of the wwir from before periastron are shielded from ionizing photons from @xmath1 .",
    "we do not expect this material to be neutral due to the long recombination time - scales for gas at these densities ( @xmath51  ) and temperatures ( @xmath13  k ) .",
    "the disappearance of the shock - heated region in the trailing arm of the wwir , caused by the curvature of the wwir , causes a strong asymmetry in the high temperature gas which is now mainly present in the wwir leading arm .",

    ", he in the extended primary wind is mostly neutral .",
    "this includes post - shock gas in the remnant of the trailing arm , and a significant portion of the extended leading arm , of the wwir .",
    "observations show that the broad lines are blueshifted for most of the orbital period , both in emission and absorption . the p  cygni absorption starts increasing approximately three weeks before spectroscopic phase zero , reaching maximum absorption around phase zero , before decreasing to a complete disappearance @xmath1420  days after phase zero @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity of the absorption reaches its maximum blueshifted value ( @xmath63  ) shortly before periastron , and then suddenly shifts during periastron down to @xmath64 .",
    "this absorption must be produced by material between the observer and @xmath5 , either in the wwir or in the pre - shock @xmath5wind .",
    "because the radial velocity variations seen in the @xmath657067 absorption are reminiscent of those observed from a star in a highly eccentric orbit , @xcite assumed that the absorption is associated with the pre - shock wind of @xmath5 , ionized by the far - uv flux from @xmath1 .",
    "however , this assumption leads to an unusual , extreme system mass ratio of @xmath66 , with a mass for @xmath1of 210  and a mass for @xmath5of @xmath67  , in strong disagreement with the most commonly accepted values .",
    "in contrast , based on the maximum velocity of the absorption seen in the line and the requirements of high excitation flux and gas density , @xcite conclude that the only plausible locations for the formation of the broad absorptions are the walls of the wwir .",
    "our rt results favour this second scenario . at periastron ,",
    "@xmath1is deep within the primary wind and its -ionizing photons are not able to reach the pre - shock @xmath5wind or penetrate beyond the dense layer of post - shock @xmath5wind . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : casea_xy ] ( central column , middle and bottom rows ) , he in the pre - shock @xmath5wind is almost entirely neutral .",
    "the region of is confined to the centre of the system .",
    "modeling of @xmath2  car s x - ray light curve and observed broad , extended emission from numerous forbidden emission lines have helped constrain the orbital inclination ( @xmath68 ) , argument of periapsis ( @xmath69 ) , and sky position angle ( pa@xmath70 ) of the @xmath2  carbinary system @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the @xmath2  carbinary is inclined away from the observer by roughly @xmath71 , with @xmath72@xmath73 and pa@xmath74@xmath75 , which places @xmath1at apastron on the observer s side of the system and implies that @xmath1orbits clockwise on the sky . with this orientation of the binary on the sky , at apastron , our line - of - sight ( los ) is more perpendicular to the apex of the wwir surface .",
    "based on the results in , we propose that the much denser wwir ( specifically , the compressed post - shock @xmath5wind ) should dominate the p  cygni absorption at phases around apastron . however , because our los is more perpendicular to the wwir around apastron , the column density of material between us and the continuum source @xmath5is relatively modest , resulting in a moderate amount of absorption . moreover , because we are viewing the wwir inclined away from us at roughly 45  degrees , material flowing toward us within the wall of post - shock @xmath5wind will have a maximum los velocity of @xmath14  300  , since the maximum true velocity of the gas within the compressed wall of post - shock @xmath5wind will be roughly equal to the terminal velocity of @xmath5 s wind .    when approaching periastron , the trailing arm of the wwir sweeps across our los .",
    "when this occurs , our los is parallel to and intersecting the wwir .",
    "this results in a significantly increased column of between us and @xmath5 , producing an increase in the amount of absorption . because we are now looking directly down the wwir",
    ", we are also seeing the fastest material in los , resulting not only in an increase in the amount of absorption , but also an increase in the blue - shifted velocity of this absorption .",
    "this scenario is in qualitative agreement with both the increase in the absorption and its shift toward more blue - shifted velocities of the observed p  cygni profiles going into periastron .",
    "just after periastron , the strong @xmath657067 absorption component rapidly vanishes .",
    "this is also consistent with our results , since we see that at periastron , @xmath1is no longer able to ionize the wwir or the primary wind . with the observer on the apastron side of the system ,",
    "the gas in los , further away from the central region , can not be ionized by @xmath1 , resulting in effectively no between us and the central @xmath5   region , and thus a lack of absorption .",
    "the results in imply that the emission seen around apastron should arise from a combination of the inner @xmath5   zone , the pre - shock @xmath5wind close to the wwir apex ionized by @xmath1 , and the layer of post - shock @xmath5wind in the wwir that is also ionized by @xmath1 .",
    "the different regions , depending on the orbital phase , where the emission can form might help explain the multiple emission components observed in the line profiles @xcite . at periastron , as discussed in , the wwir apex is inside @xmath5 s region .",
    "the fact that @xmath1is able to ionize an extremely small region close to the centre of the system during periastron means that the dominant source of emission at periastron is the inner @xmath5   region .",
    "based on our models , little to no emission is expected from the wwir at and just after periastron .    just before periastron",
    ", the @xmath654686 line intensity increases suddenly and then drops sharply to zero , after which it recovers to a second peak before declining back to zero @xcite . based on the density and energy required for the formation of this line ,",
    "the most plausible region in which it can form during periastron passage is close to the wwir apex @xcite .",
    "our results support the scenario proposed by in which the @xmath654686 emission , observed at phases @xmath76  0.981.3 , is generated in the inner region of @xmath5 s dense wind , with the necessary -ionizing photons coming from the radiatively - cooling shocks in the wwir .",
    "our rt results show that , near periastron , @xmath1 s ionizing flux is unable to produce a significant , extended region of in either the dense pre - shock @xmath5wind or the densest parts of the wwir . even though the unshocked @xmath1wind remains in the state during periastron ,",
    "as discussed by e.g. @xcite , the much lower - density @xmath1wind is incapable of adequately explaining the observed @xmath654686 emission around periastron .",
    "thus , the only remaining region that can give rise to the observed @xmath654686 emission is the zone in @xmath5 s dense inner wind .",
    "the sharp drop in @xmath654686 emission seen near periastron might be caused by a combination of two effects .",
    "first , we note that at periastron , the wwir opening angle decreases considerably due to the much lower wind momentum ratio , caused by a large decrease in the pre - shock velocity of @xmath1 s wind due to the decreased orbital separation and radiative inhibition effects ( see section  [ sec : results ] and ) . at periastron , @xmath1and the narrowed wwir are also behind @xmath5and its optically - thick wind ( relative to the observer ) .",
    "thus , @xmath1and the wwir are both ` eclipsed ' by @xmath5and its dense wind at periastron .",
    "second , if the wwir ` collapses ' at periastron due to the reduced @xmath1wind speed ( see discussions in e.g. @xcite ; ) , the radiatively - cooling wwir shocks might disappear .",
    "if this occurs , the source of -ionizing photons ( i.e. the soft x - rays generated in the radiative shocks ) necessary to produce the emission might also disappear . there",
    "would then be no significant emission at periastron .",
    "we believe that a combination of a wind - eclipse by @xmath5and a ` collapse ' of the wwir is currently the best scenario for explaining the observed drop in @xmath654686 emission near periastron .    the case  b simulation results are similar to those of case  a , but with two major differences .",
    "the 1d cmfgen models @xcite predict a radius for the inner region , due to @xmath5ionization , of @xmath77  au , more than a factor of two larger than in case  a. even without this larger ionization region , @xmath1photons are able to ionize the denser primary wind that is expanding into the @xmath1wind cavity and reach the receding unshocked @xmath1wind on the apastron side of the system .",
    "qualitatively , we expect these differences to produce variations , compared to case  a , both in the strength and velocity of the he emission and absorption lines .",
    "moreover , the fact that @xmath1ionizing photons are still able at apastron to reach the periastron side of the system , have important implications on the phases at which these observed features occur .",
    "the increase in wwir opening angle as drops should also alter the timing of when specific he emission and absorption features are observed .",
    "finally , we wish to comment on one detail not implemented in our 3d simulations that may alter slightly the he ionization structure around periastron .",
    "our current models do not include an ionizing source at the location of @xmath5 .",
    "the reasons for this , discussed in @xcite , are related to the complexities of proper spectroscopic modeling of the dense , extended wind photosphere of @xmath5 , which requires inclusion of the many ionization states of metals up to and including iron .",
    "however , we note that during periastron passage , @xmath1and the wwir penetrate deep within the extended wind of @xmath5 , down into its hotter regions where he is ionized to .",
    "this ` bore - hole ' effect has many repercussions for multiwavelength observables ( see @xcite ) , and it may affect the he ionization structure of the innermost regions of the @xmath2  carsystem as well .",
    "this is because the hole created by the wwir cavity within the innermost @xmath5wind may provide an escape path for higher - energy photons from @xmath5 .",
    "these higher energy @xmath5photons may be able to escape through the wwir cavity and help ionize he in portions of the dense arms of the wwir , and possibly a very thin layer of pre - shock @xmath5wind located beyond the wwir .",
    "such an effect would be limited to around periastron and extremely short - lived since the wwir geometry changes so rapidly .",
    "escaping higher - energy photons from the interior of @xmath5would only be able to escape in very specific directions and travel a limited distance before the wwir geometry shifted and shut - off ( or changed the direction of ) the escaping radiation .",
    "thus , the effect would be limited to the innermost regions .",
    "it is also questionable whether such changes to the he ionization structure would even be observable , since the wwir and bore - hole would be located on the opposite side of @xmath5and directed away from the observer .",
    "more detailed 3d radiation - hydrodynamics simulations are necessary to accurately determine how much this bore - hole effect may alter the inner he ionization structure and affect observations of different he lines .",
    "we presented the ionization structure of helium at periastron in the inner regions of the @xmath2  carbinary system due to the hot secondary star s ionizing flux and collisional ionization . in our analysis , we considered two different , i.e. case  a ( @xmath16  ) and case  b ( @xmath17  ) .",
    "we created he ionization maps by post - processing 3d sph simulations of the @xmath2  carsystem with simplex .",
    "below we summarize our most important results and conclusions .    1 .   at periastron , in the case  a simulation , the dense @xmath5wind expanding into the @xmath1wind cavity is able to stop @xmath1 s -ionizing photons .",
    "helium is only singly - ionized by @xmath1 in a very thin layer along the wwir leading arm , and in a very small region close to the stars .",
    "2 .   in case",
    "b , the larger wwir opening angle and lower allow @xmath1to ionize a region of the lower - density unshocked @xmath1wind expanding in the apastron direction .",
    "3 .   the inner volume due to @xmath5does",
    "not produce relevant differences in the final ionization structures due to @xmath1 in simulation case  a. in case  b , the larger @xmath5   radius allows the @xmath1ionizing photons to reach deeper into the dense @xmath5wind and create a lower ionization fraction in the pre - shock primary wind .",
    "collisional ionization creates in the hot shock - heated gas in the leading arm of the wwir and in the adiabatically - cooling remnant of the trailing arm formed just before periastron .",
    "our rt results support a binary orientation in which apastron is on the observer s side of the system , with the trailing arm of the wwir sweeping across our los as periastron is approached .",
    "the small region at the centre of the system is the main region were emission can form during periastron .",
    "there is little to no absorption at periastron because @xmath1 s ionizing flux is effectively trapped by @xmath5 s dense wind , leading to a lack of dense gas between us and the continuum source @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed changes in strength and radial velocity of the p  cygni lines across periastron .",
    "a lack of any significant in / near the wwir at periastron , due to @xmath1 , implies that the increased @xmath654686 emission that is observed around periastron must arise from the inner region in @xmath5 s dense wind .",
    "our results favour a scenario in which a combination of a wind - eclipse by @xmath5and a ` collapse ' of the wwir are responsible for the observed drop in @xmath654686 emission at periastron .",
    "our model he - ionization structures at periastron are in qualitative agreement with available observations of @xmath2  car s he lines . in the future , we plan to generate synthetic he line profiles for comparison to available observational data in order to place tighter constraints on the orbital , stellar , and wind parameters of @xmath2  car .",
    "these synthetic spectra , together with those generated for the spectroscopic high state around apastron , will help us better understand the numerous observed spectral features generated in the inner @xmath78  au of the system .",
    "our final aim is to use 3d time - dependent radiation - hydrodynamics simulations to more properly follow the ionization and recombination of the gas without postprocessing .",
    "this is particularly important in the rapidly changing conditions and highly asymmetric situation at periastron .",
    "t. i. m. is supported by an appointment to the nasa postdoctoral program at the goddard space flight center , administered by oak ridge associated universities through a contract with nasa ."
