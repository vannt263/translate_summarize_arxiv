    "diffuse , synchrotron radio sources with no obvious optical counterparts have been detected in several clusters of galaxies .",
    "they provide evidence for the existence of @xmath3 mpc scale distribution of magnetic fields and relativistic particles in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "these sources are broadly classified into two types- radio halos and radio relics .",
    "radio halos are unpolarized ( @xmath4 ) , have a regular morphology and are centrally located in galaxy clusters like the hot gas emitting thermal x - rays ; radio relics are elongated , single or double arc - like , located at the peripheries of clusters and show strong polarization ( @xmath5 ) ( feretti & giovannini 1996 ; giovannini et al 2002 ; ferrari et al 2008 ) .",
    "these sources have steep spectra ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and are @xmath8 - 1 mpc in size .",
    "halos and relics have typical surface brightnesses of @xmath9mjy arcmin@xmath10 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the origins of relativistic electrons and large scale magnetic fields in the icm are still unclear .",
    "the relativistic electron population in the icm could either be injected by radio galaxies and stellar feedback or electrons in the icm accelerated in shocks . the relativistic ( lorentz factor @xmath11 ) population of electrons",
    "can not diffuse to distances of @xmath3 mpc in their short radiative lifetimes of @xmath12yr in magnetic fields @xmath13 g . this leads to the requirement of in - situ re - acceleration of electrons in the icm to produce a mpc scale radio halo .",
    "there are two classes of models which are considered - ( a ) re - acceleration of electrons by turbulence in the icm ( reviews by brunetti 2003 , 2004 ; sarazin 2004 ; fujita et al 2003 ; brunetti et al 2004 ; brunetti & lazarian 2007 ) and ( b ) the secondary electron models(dennison 1980 ; blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ; dolag & ensslin 2000 ) . in the secondary electron models ,",
    "the protons in the icm that are accelerated to relativistic energies in shocks lead to the production of relativistic electrons and positrons by inelastic p - p collisions .",
    "the secondary electrons are produced continuously in the cluster by the protons which have lifetimes comparable to the age of the cluster and thus cluster wide emission can be explained without encountering the problem of short radiative lifetimes of relativistic electrons .",
    "the gamma ray flux from the icm predicted by these models has not been detected so far .",
    "this is a serious drawback of these models .",
    "the two models considered for relics are ( a ) diffusive shock acceleration of thermal electrons by fermi i process ( ensslin et al 1998 ; roettiger et al 1999 ) or of fossil relativistic electrons ( markevitch et al 2005 ) and ( b ) revival of fossil radio cocoons by adiabatic compression due to shocks in the icm ( ensslin & gopal krishna 2001 , hereafter eg01 ; ensslin & bruggen 2002 ; hoeft et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "large scale structure formation simulations show that structure formation , accretion and mergers drive shocks in the icm ( miniati et al .",

    "2003 ; pfrommer et al .",
    "sub - structures in the x - ray emission from cluster cores , imaged in high resolution by _",

    "mcnamara et al .",
    "2002 ; markevitch et al .",
    "the gravitational binding energy released in cluster - cluster mergers is @xmath14 erg and thus if only @xmath15 of it is utilised in accelerating particles , sources like the radio halos ( @xmath16 erg ) could be produced .",
    "there is increasing evidence that radio halos and relics occur in clusters which have undergone a merger event in the last @xmath17 gyr ( feretti et al .",
    "2006 ) . in a few clusters such as a2256 ( briel & henry 1994 ) and a1367 ( donnelly et al . 1998 ) it has been possible to detect cluster merger shocks as temperature jumps in the x - ray emitting icm .",
    "these clusters are also hosts to radio relics which have been proposed to have formed by acceleration of electrons in the shock structures of the cosmological large - scale matter flows ( ensslin et al 1998 ) . the shocks or turbulence in the icm , which are considered responsible for the acceleration of electrons , would leave signatures in the resulting spectrum of the accelerated particles .",
    "spectral index is a tracer of the age of the relativistic plasma and hence its distribution over the halo / relic can reveal sites of ongoing reacceleration .",
    "relics showing a trend of gradual flattening of spectral index from the edge near the cluster core to the edge farther from the cluster core could indicate relation to outgoing merger shocks . in the case of the double relics in a1240",
    "( bonafede et al . 2009 ) and the relic in a521 ( giacintucci et al . 2008 ) this possibility based on morphologies of the relics , the spectral index maps and the polarization has been considered .",
    "patches of steep / flat spectral index could indicate complex process of re - acceleration such as turbulent reacceleration .",
    "radial steepening of spectral index of halos could also be related to the cluster scale magnetic field distribution ( feretti et al 2004 ) .",
    "the correspondence between x - ray sub - structure or temperature map and the spectral index maps can reveal properties of the relativistic electron population . in order to carry out such studies of halos and relics , multi - frequency observations are necessary .",
    "radio halos and relics have been studied mainly at 1.4 ghz ( giovannini et al 1999 ; govoni et al 2001 ; bacchi et al 2003(hereafter ba03 ) ; clarke et al 2006 ) .",
    "observations at frequencies other than @xmath18ghz are required to study the spectra of halos and relics and to compare with model predictions .",
    "recently a low frequency halo has been detected in the cluster a521 by brunetti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the maps at 235 , 330 and 610 mhz .",
    "this halo was missed at higher frequencies ( @xmath19 ghz ) due to cutoff in the spectrum .",
    "this detection emphasises the importance of low frequency observations and provides an example of a class of halos which will be detected only at low frequencies .",
    "the extended nature and steep spectra make halos and relics ideal targets for low frequency ( @xmath20 ghz ) observations .",
    "in recent years , the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) has provided imaging opportunities at frequencies of 610 , 330 , 235 and 150 mhz with resolutions of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "a few attempts have been made to image halos and relics with the gmrt .",
    "the radio halo in galaxy cluster a3562 has been successfully imaged at 235 mhz by giacintucci et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "brunetti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have discovered the low frequency halo in a521 with the gmrt . a search for radio halos and relics in galaxy clusters , which resulted in the detection of 10 new radio halos and 3 relics ,",
    "has been carried out at 610 mhz with the gmrt ( venturi et al 2008 ) . at low frequencies ,",
    "the primary beams are larger compared to those at higher frequencies and thus a larger field can be imaged in a single pointing .",
    "considering the fact that relics occur at peripheries of clusters , it is essential that a large field around the cluster centre be imaged .",
    "for example , in a2255 , which is well known for the presence of a halo and relic , new relics at a distance of @xmath25 mpc ( @xmath26 ) from the cluster centre were discovered in 350 mhz observations ( pizzo et al 2008 ) .    with the hybrid configuration of",
    "the gmrt , imaging of structures of angular sizes @xmath27 with a resolution of @xmath28 at 150 mhz and with a sensitivity of @xmath31.5 - 3 mjybeam@xmath29 is possible .",
    "we selected halos and relics for low frequency observations with the gmrt .",
    "haloes / relics which had extents of @xmath30 at 1.4 ghz were selected so that the coverage at short baselines available at the gmrt is sufficient to image the full extents of these sources .",
    "further , sources with expected @xmath31 surface brightness at 150 mhz of @xmath32mjybeam@xmath29 were selected . with our previous experience of the dynamic range limitation of @xmath3 1500 in the gmrt images",
    ", we avoided those clusters which had radio sources @xmath33 jy within the hpbw of primary beam ( @xmath34 ) at 150 mhz .",
    "as a first phase of imaging galaxy clusters at low frequencies , three galaxy clusters a2255 , a2256 and a754 were observed at 150 mhz with the gmrt .",
    "galaxy cluster a2255 is host to a radio halo and a relic ( feretti et al .",
    "1997 ) and two relics about 2 mpc from the cluster centre ( pizzo et al 2008 ) . the radio halo of a2255 is polarized ( @xmath5 , govoni et al 2005 ) . in a2256 a radio halo and a relic have been detected ( kim 1999 ; clarke et al 2006 ; brentjens 2008 ) .",
    "in a754 two components of diffuse radio emission ( kassim et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter ka01 ; ba03 ) have been detected but the nature of these are still unclear .",

    "pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium is achieved faster .",
    "the plasma can be revived by shock compression even after 1 gyr .",
    "scenario c : cocoon near an active radio galaxy(smoking gun)- a radio galaxy which is possibly the source of the relativistic electrons is visible near the relic .",
    "this case is illustrated by the example of the relic in coma by eg01 ( see eg01 for details ) . in a754",
    "the relic ( blob 4 ) has been detected at all the 3 frequencies .",
    "the model has been used to obtain a spectrum which fits the observed spectrum of the relic best .",
    "scenario a was considered best suited for a754 since the relic is located in a region where the x - ray emission has been detected ( henry et al 2004 ) .",

    "the radio plasma was assumed to be in @xmath99 phase and the estimated magnetic field ( @xmath100 ) and volume ( @xmath72 ) of the relic were used . using compression ratio ( @xmath101 ) for the @xmath99 phase , back calculation was carried out to find the @xmath100 and @xmath72 for @xmath102 phase successively till phase 0 .",
    "the spectrum was obtained for each of the phases .",
    "it was checked whether the model spectrum in the @xmath99 phase , in which the relic was assumed to be in , was a good fit to the integrated spectrum of the relic .",
    "if the spectrum was a bad fit to the observed spectrum , the plasma was assumed to be in another phase and the same steps were carried out . in a case where the relic was assumed to be in phase 1 ,",
    "the corresponding model spectrum was flatter than could fit the observed data . in another case where the relic was assumed to be in phase 2 , the spectrum was steeper .",
    "a phase intermediate to 1 and 2 was tried and the best fit to the observed spectrum was obtained .",
    "this intermediate phase is referred as `` phase @xmath103 '' .",
    "the model spectra are shown in fig .",
    "these spectra were constructed using the parameters listed in table 3 .",
    "the observed values of the flux density of blob 4 at 150 , 330 and 1363 mhz with the @xmath104 error bars are plotted along with the model spectra .",
    "the initial energy distribution of the relativistic electrons was assumed to be a power law with a spectral index of 2.6 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the flux density at 150 mhz was used to normalize the model spectrum .",
    "a good fit was obtained by considering the relic to be in flashing phase (  phase 3  ) too .",
    "the volume in the injection phase ( phase 0 ) required in this case to produce the observed size of the relic after compression by shock is @xmath106 mpc@xmath67 .",
    "this implies that a volume of @xmath106mpc@xmath67 must have been filled with radio plasma by cluster radio galaxies forming a gigantic cocoon . considering the typical size of a radio galaxy to be 100 kpc ( middle value in fig . 9 of blundell et al 1999 ) and assuming it to fill a sphere of that radius with relativistic plasma , at least @xmath107 such sources are required to be active within a period of @xmath108gyr , to fill a giant cocoon of volume 0.15 mpc@xmath67 .",
    "such a situation is improbable in any typical galaxy cluster .",
    "in imaging extended emission at radio frequencies crucial roles are played by the uv - coverage , the sensitivity and the field of view .",
    "these vary with the observing frequency and the instrument used .",
    "further , the spectra of halos and relics are not the same over the extent of the source ; there can be isolated regions of steep and flat spectral indices . due to this interplay between the different aspects of the observational limitations and the intrinsic properties of the diffuse emission , multi - frequency observations of halos and relics are necessary to obtain maximum information and to make further inferences . in the case of a754",
    ", blob 1 has been detected only at 150 mhz whereas blob 4 is detected at all of 150 , 330 and 1363 mhz , but better at 1363 mhz .",
    "the spectra of blobs 1 , 2 and 3 are steeper than that of blob 4 .",
    "the framework of adiabatic compression model ( eg01 ) has been used to explain the spectrum of the blob 4 in a754 .",
    "it was found that , the relic ( blob 4 ) can be considered as a cocoon of a radio galaxy lurking for @xmath109 yr in the icm .",
    "no shock compression was required to produce the spectrum of the relic .",
    "the consideration of blob 4 as a compressed radio cocoon ( flashing phase ) led to an unrealistic situation of the cluster having a gigantic ( @xmath106 mpc@xmath67 ) radio cocoon in the past , which appears unlikely .",
    "thus , merger shocks need not be invoked to explain the observed properties of the relic .",
    "the flux densities at 150 , 330 and 1363 mhz imply spectral indices steeper than 1.5 for blobs 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "based on the result for blob 4 from the adiabatic compression model , these blobs of diffuse emission are likely to be radio cocoons lurking in the icm for more than @xmath110yr .    in a few clusters that have relics , merger shocks",
    "have been considered to be responsible for accelerating electrons ( eg .",
    "a3376 , bagchi et al .",
    "according to the numerical model of roettiger et al ( 1998 ) in a754 , a large subcluster has crossed the main cluster from east to west .",
    "the 4 diffuse blobs in a754 lie along the east - west axis which is approximately the proposed axis of merger ( zz95 ) .",
    "the proposed location of the eastern shock wave is coincident with the x - ray peak and is close to blobs 1 and 2 .",
    "the steep spectral indices of blobs 1 and 2 could be explained in the fermi i acceleration scenario by a low mach number shock ( mach number @xmath111 for a spectral index steeper than 2.0 ; blandford & eichler 1987 ) .",
    "the western shock has been proposed to be at a location @xmath112 mpc from the x - ray peak ( roettiger et al . 1998 ; ka01 ) .",
    "the blob 4 which is in the western region is only 0.7 mpc from the x - ray peak and is not coincident with the proposed location of the shock . according to the numerical model the shocks crossed the cluster more than 0.3 gyr ago which is longer than the radiative lifetime of the electrons observed at 150 mhz . in a754 ,",
    "no other relics have been detected in the primary beam at 150 mhz .",
    "sensitive polarization study of the diffuse emission has not been carried out to find other signatures of shocks such as alignment of magnetic field in the plane of the shock .",
    "upperlimits on polarized flux density of @xmath113 and @xmath114 have been obtained by ba03 on the western and eastern diffuse emission respectively in a754 .",
    "mergers can create turbulence in the icm which could then accelerate particles .",
    "it has been proposed that fermi acceleration powered by turbulence in the icm can accelerate particles to relativistic energies ( brunetti et al 2008 and references therein ) if the turbulence lasts for more than @xmath110yr .",
    "particles in the icm , through resonant scattering off the turbulent waves , can be stochastically accelerated to relativistic energies ( melrose 1980 ) .",
    "the relation between mergers and turbulent acceleration of particles is complex and the details are not clear . the steep spectrum with a cutoff at high frequencies is a signature of turbulent reacceleration ( kuo et al 2003 ; brunetti et al 2004 ; cassano et al 2005 ) .",
    "a halo has been detected in a521 at low frequencies such as 235 , 330 and 610 mhz ( brunetti et al . 2008 ) having spectral index of @xmath25 .",
    "a high frequency spectral cutoff is suspected by the authors for this halo making it undetectable at 1.4 ghz with the reported sensitivity of their observation .",
    "turbulent reacceleration model has been invoked to explain the low frequency halo .",
    "it is likely that many such diffuse features having cutoff at high frequencies could be lurking in clusters but have not been detected since no low frequency observations have been carried out .",
    "the non - detection of blob 1 at 330 and 1363 mhz indicates cutoff in its spectrum .",
    "this implies the possibility of turbulent reacceleration .",
    "the case of blob 4 , not requiring shock to explain the radio emission , is also consistent with the picture of turbulent reacceleration .",
    "another possibility is that the shocks accelerated the protons in the icm which produced secondary electrons and positrons by hadronic collisions .",
    "these secondary particles then produced the observed radio - halo emission . in this case",
    "the radio emission can last long after the passage of shock .",
    "this scenario will be tested with the detection of gamma ray flux expected from the decay of neutral pions after the p - p collisions ( ensslin et al . 1997 ; colafrancesco & blasi 1998 ; blasi 1998 ; dolag & ensslin 2000 ) .",
    "we have presented a gmrt 150 mhz image of the a754 region .",
    "we detected 4 blobs of diffuse emission at 150 mhz with a resolution of @xmath115 .",
    "we made high resolution images using the archival data at 330 ( gmrt ) and 1363 mhz ( vla ) to estimate flux densities of discrete sources and used the published images of a754 at 74 , 330 and 1363 mhz(vla ) to compare the diffuse features .",
    "the blob 1 is detected only at 150 mhz .",
    "the blob 4 , is detected at all the three frequencies .",
    "the blob 4 , lies along the axis of merger in a754 and on the far side of the x - ray peak ; thus we refer to it as a relic . within the framework of the adiabatic compression model ( eg01 )",
    ", we found that the blob 4 can be explained as an ageing cocoon of an old radio galaxy in the cluster .",
    "the spectra of blobs 1 , 2 and 3 of diffuse emission are steeper and thus can be considered as radio cocoons older than the relic . not requiring shock to explain the radio emission of blob 4 , is also consistent with the picture of turbulent reacceleration .",
