    "the essence of radiotherapy with heavy charged particles is its intrinsic capability of three - dimensional dose formation with a bragg peak at the beam range , which can be precisely controlled by adapting the beam energy incident on a patient . in conventional broad - beam delivery,@xcite",
    "a range shifter degrades excessive beam energy and a range compensator fills target - depth deficit varying in the field to best conform the spread - out bragg peak to a planning target volume.@xcite    a range shifter is typically a composite of plates of precisely controlled thickness and a range compensator is a physical filter custom - made for an individual field .",
    "their material should be uniform , stable , machinable , inexpensive , and ideally equivalent to water , which is the reference material for dosimetry .",
    "these requirements are also valid for solid phantom materials , which are used when water - phantom dosimetry is not possible or convenient . to estimate the effective thickness of a material by the resultant range shift in water , an effective density",
    "is assigned for the material . however , this approximation may cause dosimetric errors due to alteration of the radiation because the effective density differs for multiple scattering and nuclear interactions.@xcite dosimetric water equivalence , which is evaluated by uniformity of effective densities for relevant interactions , is essential to energy degrading of charged - particle beams for range shifting , range compensation , and dosimetry .",
    "some common materials used for this purpose are high - density polyethylene ( hdpe),@xcite polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma),@xcite and synthetic resin of acrylonitrile , butadiene , and styrene ( abs).@xcite in general , hdpe is inexpensive and close to water in density , pmma is good at dimensional stability and contains oxygen which is dominant in water , and abs is available in various forms in industry as chemical wood . for proton and ion - beam dosimetry ,",
    "pmma has been commonly used as a water - equivalent phantom material.@xcite    in the past , water equivalence of general plastics ( pmma , hdpe , ps , and ptfe ) , tissue - substitute plastics ( a150 and commercial products ) , and other solid materials ( graphite , bone , aluminum , and copper ) have been studied for energy degrading and calorimetry of proton and ion beams by experiment and monte carlo simulation.@xcite those studies primarily focused on fluence - correction factor , which is the ratio of dose in water to dose - to - water in material of interest at a same water - equivalent depth . while the fluence - correction factor is essential for dosimetry with non - water phantom , generalization for a variety of modulated treatment beams may be difficult due to varied dose contribution from secondary particles and atomic recoils .    for carbon - ion radiotherapy ,",
    "the radiation components need to be handled separately due to variability of relative biological effectiveness with particle charge and energy,@xcite for which the fluence - correction factor for total dose would not suffice . instead",
    ", survival of carbon ions that attenuate with depth to form a bragg peak could be clinically more relevant . in this regard ,",
    "we evaluate water equivalence of some plastics for energy degrading of carbon - ion beams .",
    "in addition to hdpe and pmma , we theoretically evaluated two other oxygen - rich plastics , polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) and polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , among which we experimentally tested hdpe , pmma , and pom with carbon - ion beams .",
    "we excluded abs as it varies in composition of carbon , hydrogen , and nitrogen .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] summarizes the relevant properties of these plastics and water,@xcite in which the densities may vary with degree of polymerization .",
    "incidentally , @xmath0 is the electron density , where @xmath1 is the atomic mass unit .",
    ".[tab:1 ] material properties ( elemental composition , oxygen weight fraction @xmath2 , typical density @xmath3 , number of electrons per atomic mass unit @xmath4 , and mean excitation energy @xmath5 ) excerpted from ref .",
    "( also available at http://pdg.lbl.gov/[the particle data group website ] ) except for an empirical hdpe density . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      carbon - ion attenuation ratio @xmath6 measured as bragg - peak reduction for range shift @xmath7 by hdpe ( circles ) , pmma ( squares ) , and pom ( triangles ) for 290-mev ( open ) and 430-mev ( filled ) beams along with analytical model curves ( solid lines ) . ]",
    "as the density of polymer plastics depends on manufacturing condition , the effective density must be experimentally determined before its clinical use to an accuracy better than 1% .",
    "therefore , the stopping - power similarity to water ( @xmath8 ) for hdpe is not essentially an advantage .",
    "the similarity is only relevant when geometrical dose properties are of interest , such as field width and penumbra size . for applications that allow or require regular air gaps in a phantom , higher @xmath9 values are acceptable or",
    "may even be preferable .",
    "for example , yajima _ et al . _ developed a multilayer ionization chamber composed of 3-mm and 4-mm pmma plates interleaved with 1-mm air gaps,@xcite which would reduce the density by factor @xmath10 resulting in mean stopping - power ratio @xmath11 .",
    "if pom is used instead , the @xmath12 value will be 1.06 , which will further be adjusted to 1.00 by extending the air gaps to 1.26 mm .",
    "beam blurring due to multiple scattering in a range compensator should ideally be minimized . in this",
    "regard , hdpe with @xmath13 is superior to pmma ( 0.890 ) , pet ( 0.953 ) , pom ( 0.968 ) , and water ( 1 ) although their effective differences will be generally marginal .",
    "for example , when a carbon - ion beam of 20-cm avaiable range traverses a plastic plate for 10-cm range shift , the induced beam blurring in 30-cm distance will be 1.9 mm for hdpe , 2.1 mm for pmma , 2.2 mm for pet , and 2.2 mm for pom , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "the dosimetric water equivalence of the plastics that we tested here originated from the similarity with water in oxygen content and should be also valid for protons and other ions .",
    "therefore , pom will be generally a good dosimetric material if its high density is tolerable .",
    "for some dosimetric applications that require material transparency , such as water tank with optical dosimeter - alignment system , pet may desirably substitute for pmma .",
    "we evaluated dosimetric water equivalence of four common plastics , hdpe , pmma , pet , and pom , by uniformity of effective densities for carbon - ion - beam interactions . among them , pom was the best and virtually indistinguishable from high - density water , which would be ideal for range control and preferable for dosimetry with regular air gaps such as for multilayer ionization chamber . for applications that require transparency such as water tank with optical dosimeter - alignment system , pmma was verified to be reasonably water equivalent and pet would be even better .",
    "the poorest was hdpe with a large fractional attenuation ratio of 0.45% per cm range shift , although with marginal superiority for reduced multiple scattering .",
    "analytical model calculations agreed with measurements within 1% for carbon - ion - survival ratio of plastic to water .",
    "the water equivalence of plastics was highly correlated with their oxygen content , as expected from the composition of water .",
    "haettner _ et al . _ measured the number of carbon ions , @xmath14 , attenuating with depth @xmath15 in water for @xmath16 mev and 400 mev.@xcite we compiled their data to construct an energy - independent universal formula as a function of residual range in water , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the range - equivalent depth .    using the measured @xmath19 curve for each energy , the @xmath18",
    "was tentatively set to the maximum - gradient depth . using the data points for @xmath20 ,",
    "a straight line was fitted and its intercept at @xmath21 was defined as the number of stopped carbon ions , @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath18 was then redefined with submillimeter adjustment to meet @xmath23 .",
    "the measurements showed natural exponential behavior for @xmath24 cm , for which we determined the mean free path using the 400-mev dataset . while there would naturally be some difference between the energies in the small region of @xmath25 cm due to marginal variation of range straggling , systematic deviation was observed unexpectedly in the larger region of @xmath26 cm .",
    "as the exponential behavior held in the intermediate region of @xmath27 for the 200-mev dataset , the deviation may be attributed to increased measurement difficulty for the 400-mev beam .",
    "therefore , we rescaled the 400-mev dataset to match the 200-mev dataset in the exponential region of @xmath24 cm and we adopted the straight line fitted to the 200-mev dataset for the @xmath28 cm region .",
    "the resultant universal formula for carbon - ion attenuation is @xmath29 which is shown in fig .",
