    "self - interacting random processes play a prominent role in the probability theory and in statistical physic .",
    "one fascinating aspect is that behind an apparent simplicity , they can be extremely hard to analyze rigorously .",
    "just to mention one striking example , it is still not known whether once reinforced random walks on a ladder are recurrent in general ( see however @xcite and @xcite for a partial answer and the surveys @xcite and @xcite for other problems on reinforced processes ) .",
    "a major difficulty in these models is that we loose the markovian property and in particular the usual dichotomy between recurrence and transience can be broken .",
    "a famous example where this happens is for vertex reinforced random walks on @xmath1 : it is now a well known result in the field , first conjectured and partially proved by pemantle and volkov @xcite , that almost surely these processes eventually get stuck on five sites @xcite . for analogous results concerning self - attracting diffusions , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "beside this very basic , yet fundamental , problem of recurrence , a question of particular interest is to understand the connections between the various discrete and continuous models . in particular",
    "an important challenging conjecture is that self - avoiding random walks on @xmath2 converge , after renormalization , toward the @xmath3 ( see @xcite for a discussion on this and @xcite for some recent progress ) .",
    "there are in fact not many examples where invariance principles or central limit theorems were fully established .",
    "but for instance it was proved that random walks perturbed at extrema converge after the usual renormalization toward a perturbed brownian motion ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the class of so - called excited random processes , which are among the most elementary examples of self - interacting processes . by this",
    "we mean that the interaction with the past trajectory is as localized as possible : the evolution of these processes at any time only depend on their local time at their present position .",
    "a discrete version was introduced relatively recently by benjamini and wilson @xcite and a generalization , called multi - excited or cookie random walks , was then further studied by zerner @xcite and many other authors ( see in particular @xcite and references therein ) . closely related models were also considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dolgopyat @xcite observed that in dimension @xmath4 , in the recurrent regime , and after the usual renormalization , multi - excited random walks also converge toward a perturbed brownian motion ( we will give a more precise statement later ) .",
    "however , as we will see below , the latter are not , in some sense , the most natural continuous versions of excited processes .",
    "somewhat more natural ones were introduced two decades ago by norris , rogers and williams @xcite , in connection with the excluded volume problem @xcite , and as a simplified model for brownian polymers .",
    "they were later called excited brownian motions by the authors @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that excited brownian motions can be approached in law by multi - excited random walks in the skorokhod space , i.e. in the sense of the full process . for this",
    "we need to use a nonstandard renormalization , namely we need to scale together and appropriately the sequence of cookies , which govern the drift of the walk , the space and the time .",
    "now let us give more details , starting with some definitions :    a multi - excited or cookie random walk @xmath5 is associated to a sequence @xmath6 of cookies in the following way : set @xmath7 for all @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 be the filtration generated by @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath11 and for all @xmath12 , @xmath13= 1 -   { \\mathbb{p}}[x_\\eps(n+1)-x_\\eps(n ) = -1 \\mid { \\mathcal{f}}_{\\eps , n } ] = p_{\\eps , i},\\ ] ] if @xmath14 .",
    "we notice that the case of random cookies has also been studied in the past , for instance by zerner @xcite , but here we consider only deterministic @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand excited brownian motions are solutions of a stochastic differential equation of the type : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a brownian motion , @xmath18 is the local time process of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is some measurable ( bounded ) function .",
    "so at a heuristic level the discrete and the continuous models are very similar : the drift is a function of the local time at the present position .",
    "but the analogy can be pushed beyond this simple observation . in particular criteria for recurrence and nonzero speed in both models",
    "( see respectively @xcite and @xcite ) are entirely similar ( see below ) .",
    "our results here give now a concrete link .",
    "we first prove that when @xmath0 is bounded and lipschitz , the local time process of @xmath10 , conveniently renormalized , converges to the one of @xmath19 , exactly in the same spirit as in tth s papers on self - interacting random walks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then we obtain a tightness result and deduce a convergence in the skorokhod space at the level of the processes ( see theorem [ cor3 ] below ) . for proving the convergence of the local time processes we use a standard criterion of ethier and kurtz @xcite on approximation of diffusions .",
    "to show that we can apply it here we introduce some auxiliary markov chains describing the local time on each level and we make a careful analysis of the transition kernels of these markov chains ( see section [ sectheo ] ) .",

    "first for @xmath37 , let @xmath40 be the right continuous inverse of the local time of @xmath19 at level @xmath41 .",

    "recurrent if all these stopping times are a.s .",

    "finite , and we recall this result now . to fix ideas we assume that @xmath51 .",
    "an analogous result holds for @xmath52 .",

    "similarly @xmath60 is solution of ( with a drift @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 and an independent brownian motion ) up to the first time , say @xmath63 , when it hits @xmath57 , and then is absorbed in @xmath57 .    for @xmath64 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the space of cdlg functions @xmath66 endowed with the usual skorokhod topology ( see for instance section 12 in @xcite ) .",
    "the space @xmath67 will also simply be denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "it will be implicit that all convergences in law of our processes hold in these spaces .",
    "our first result is the following theorem :    [ theo ] assume that @xmath0 is bounded and lipschitz .",
    "assume further that for @xmath34 large enough , @xmath36 is recurrent and that @xmath19 is recurrent .",
    "then for any finite set @xmath69 , any @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73    as announced above , this theorem gives the convergence of a sequence of excited random walks toward the excited brownian motion ( associated to @xmath0 ) at the level of the local times .",
    "we will also extend this result in a non homogeneous setting , i.e. when @xmath0 is allowed to depend also on the space variable .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ subsecnonh ] for more details .",
    "actually we will need this extension to prove theorem [ theo ] in the case @xmath74 .",
    "this will be explained in section [ ige2 ] .",
    "note that if @xmath0 is compactly supported or nonnegative ( and bounded lipschitz ) , and if @xmath75 , then @xmath19 is recurrent and @xmath36 as well for @xmath34 large enough .",
    "a consequence of theorem [ theo ] is the following    [ cor1 ] under the hypotheses of theorem [ theo ] , for any finite set @xmath69 , any @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath76}([nv_i])\\right)_{i\\in i}\\quad \\mathop{\\longrightarrow}_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}^{\\mathcal{l } } \\quad \\big(\\tau_{a_i}(v_i)\\big)_{i\\in i}.\\ ] ]    for @xmath77 , @xmath72 , denote by @xmath78 some independent geometric random variables with parameter @xmath79 , independent of @xmath36 .",

    "then as in @xcite , we can deduce from the previous results the    [ cor2 ] under the hypotheses of theorem [ theo ] , for any @xmath82 , @xmath72 , @xmath83    finally we get the following :    [ cor3 ] assume that @xmath0 is bounded and lipschitz",
    ". for @xmath84 , set @xmath85)/(2n)$ ] , which is well defined at least for @xmath34 large enough .",
    "then @xmath86    note that , as opposed to the previous results , we do not assume in this last theorem that @xmath36 and @xmath19 are recurrent .    to obtain this result",
    "we need to prove the tightness of the sequence @xmath87)/(2n)$ ] , @xmath88 .",
    "this is done by using a coupling between different branching processes , similar to those which were used for proving corollary [ cor1 ] .",
    "the convergence of finite - dimensional distributions follows from corollary [ cor2 ] and an inversion of laplace transform .    as for theorem [ theo ] an extension of this result to the non homogeneous setting",
    "can be proved ( see theorem [ theofinal ] at the end of the paper ) .",
    "let us mention now a related result of dolgopyat @xcite .",
    "he proved a functional central limit theorem for excited random walks when @xmath15 is fixed , and in the recurrent regime ; more precisely when @xmath28 for all @xmath29 and @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the limiting process is a perturbed brownian motion , i.e. the process defined by @xmath90 with @xmath17 a brownian motion",

    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be given . to fix ideas we assume that @xmath51 .",
    "the case @xmath52 is similar .",
    "moreover , we only prove the convergence of @xmath93 on the time interval @xmath94 , since the proofs of the convergence on @xmath95 $ ] and on @xmath96 are the same .        1 .",
    "the sequence @xmath98 has the same law as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is some markov chain starting from @xmath101 , which is independent of @xmath41 , 2 .",
    "conditionally to @xmath102 , the sequence @xmath103 has the same law as some markov chain @xmath104 , starting from @xmath105 , which is independent of @xmath41 , 3 .",

    "note that this idea to use the markovian property of the process @xmath112 goes back at least to kesten , kozlov and spitzer @xcite .    in the following , in order to lighten the presentation we will forget about the dependence on the starting point ( which does not play any serious role here ) in the notation for @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
