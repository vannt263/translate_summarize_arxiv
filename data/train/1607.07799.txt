    "free - space optical ( fso ) communication is a promising technology for enhancing the connectivity of wireless networks @xcite , thanks to the features such as wide band width in an unregulated spectrum , ultra - low inter - channel interference , and power - efficient transmission .",
    "potential applications of fso communication include satellite laser communications @xcite , a network system comprised of unmanned aerial vehicles , high - altitude platforms or drones @xcite , the last one mile link from the fiber backbone to the clients premises @xcite and military applications @xcite .",
    "as fso communication becomes more and more important in these applications , the security requirements also become more demanding .",
    "although high directionality of laser beam makes fso communication inherently more secure than rf counterparts , fso communication can still suffer from optical tapping risks , especially when the main lobe of laser beam footprint is considerably wider than the receiver size @xcite .",
    "these risks would be pronounced in urban communications where an eavesdropper would hide in the top of the same building as the legitimate receiver @xcite , or in satellite - to - ground laser communications in which the beam footprint would be a scale of km .",
    "therefore , secure communication over fso links still remains a challenging task .",
    "traditionally , security has been highly dependent on the upper layer protocols such as conventional encryption techniques with a pre - shared secret key or a key exchanged via public key cryptosystems .",
    "the security of these protocols is proved with algorithmic means .",
    "then , it will be weakened as computer technologies and decryption algorithms are advancing . moreover , with the rapid growth of the number of communication nodes , the key distribution and management are becoming increasingly difficult , and are introducing larger overhead and latency to the system . during the past few years , however , physical layer ( phy ) security @xcite has been gaining research attentions as a means to complement conventional encryption techniques .",
    "its security is provided in information theoretical manners based on the particular coding techniques @xcite or the careful signal designs @xcite .",
    "different from conventional encryption techniques , no computational assumptions are placed on the eavesdropper .",
    "practically , the existing security system can be enhanced by introducing phy security as a first line of defense against eavesdropping .",
    "the fundamental theoretical frameworks of phy security was laid by wyner @xcite , and csiszr and krner @xcite based on secure message transmission over a wiretap channel , and by ahlswede and csiszr @xcite , and maurer @xcite based on secret key agreement from common randomness . in the wiretap channel model , its security is provided by an appropriate channel code guaranteeing both the reliability for the legitimate receiver and the secrecy against the eavesdropper . if the channel from the sender to the eavesdropper is a degraded version of that from the sender to the legitimate receiver , a non - zero secrecy rate can be achieved by sacrificing a fraction of the message rate .",
    "while such a degraded condition seems not to be realistic in wired communications , it is more reasonable in fso communications built up between parties with a direct line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "specifically , in los links , surveillance cameras will be able to detect any suspicious activity which makes it harder for an eavesdropper to intercept the main lobe of laser beam .",
    "on the perspective of this scenario , there have been theoretical studies @xcite on the potential of phy security in fso communications .    in spite of these remarkable theoretical studies , realization of phy security is still a challenging issue . in fso links ,",
    "the intensity of the transmitted beam and the statistics of the received signals vary in a time scale of ms due to atmospheric turbulences .",
    "this kind of fading effect makes it difficult to implement an efficient coding scheme which can ensure phy security under various conditions .",
    "some approaches to mitigate the effect of atmospheric turbulences have been investigated such as the adaptive real time selection technique @xcite in a horizontal quantum communication link of 143 km between la palma and tenerife islands @xcite .",
    "however , experimental data and analyses on fso fading links from the viewpoint of phy security are still overwhelmingly lacking .",
    "this motivates us to collect transmission data in an fso wiretap channel and analyze them in terms of fundamental metrics of phy security .",
    "to this end , we have constructed a metropolitan terrestrial fso link testbed ( tokyo fso testbed ) .",
    "this testbed consists of one sender terminal and two receiver terminals , one for the legitimate receiver and the other for the eavesdropper .",
    "each of the two is 7.8 km distance apart from the sender terminal .",
    "the purposes of the testbed are ( 1 ) to examine phy security techniques ( e.g. , secure message transmission and secret key agreement ) in real - field fso links , ( 2 ) to emulate typical fso communication scenarios such as satellite - to - ground laser communications , and ( 3 ) to accumulate transmission data under several real - field conditions and utilize them for practical system design . in this paper",
    ", we focus on secure message transmission and analyze the characteristics of the fso wiretap channel by transmitting a pseudorandom binary sequence based on on - off keying modulation . using the output signal statistics , we estimate secrecy rates and related security metrics .",
    "we then discuss how the legitimate party can set a guideline for operating secure message transmission based on the observed data with pilot signals and the data accumulated from the past .",
    "throughout the paper , we consider secure message transmission via a wireless wiretap channel system illustrated in fig . [ wiretapchannelmodel ] .",
    "the sender ( alice ) encodes a confidential message into a code word random variable ( rv ) @xmath0 for transmission over the wiretap channel , where @xmath1 is the code length .",
    "we assume that alice uses on - off keying modulation , thus rv @xmath2 takes a value with @xmath3 or the peak power of the transmission laser .",
    "moreover , we also assume that the laser power and the input probability distribution @xmath4 over @xmath2 are fixed irrespective of the channel state .",
    "the legitimate receiver ( bob ) observes the output via a discrete - time quasi - static fading channel ( the main channel ) given by @xmath5 being @xmath6 the channel gain rv and @xmath7 the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) rv .",
    "the eavesdropper ( eve ) is also capable to observe alice s transmission from the output via a discrete - time quasi - static fading channel ( the wiretapper channel ) given by @xmath8 being @xmath9 the channel gain rv and @xmath10 the awgn rv . here ,",

    "it advices that some backup encryption schemes in the upper layers should be activated to prepare for the worst case scenario .",
    "although the secrecy rate is regarded as a reasonable benchmark of the system , it concerns only the asymptotic limit at code length @xmath86 .",
    "practically , in the bounded - code - length scenario , the message rate @xmath26 can not be arbitrarily close to the secrecy rate as well as the information leakage can not be completely diminished .",
    "thus , in order to design a practical code with the perfect secrecy , the message rate @xmath26 should be chosen much lower than the secrecy rate and the necessary code length @xmath1 for the required secrecy criteria should be known .",
    "this motivates researchers @xcite to introduce the secrecy exponent @xmath87 ( see appendix c ) , which is a stronger characterization showing how fast the leaked information decreases .",
    "actually , in @xcite , through the upper bound on the leaked information measure @xmath88 , where the leaked information measure @xmath89 is measured by a statistical distance between distributions @xcite , the code length dependence of @xmath89 has been investigated in the idealistic fading free model , or constant channel gain model . in what follows",
    ", we consider the application of @xmath87 on atmospheric fading channels .",
    "first , we consider the case with the weaker fading case , such as in fig .",
    "[ secrecyrate ] . in this case , the fluctuation of the instantaneous secrecy rate is also weak .",
    "we may select the worst time slot , design a code for it , and apply it for the whole interval such as 200 ms in fig .",
    "[ secrecyrate ] .",
    "now , our purpose is to investigate what code length is required in this time slot . in fig .",
    "[ leakedinfo](a ) , we show the code length dependence of the leaked information criteria @xmath89 on the time slot of the worst case ( from 76 ms to 80 ms ) in fig .",
    "[ secrecyrate ] . clearly , as @xmath26 decreases ( or the randomness rate @xmath90 increases , since we assume that sum of the rates @xmath91 is fixed ) , @xmath92 decreases faster , attaining a given criterion @xmath89 with a shorter code length . when alice and bob set @xmath26 to be 3 mbps ( the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ leakedinfo](a ) ) , @xmath93 can be obtained by a code with @xmath94 . since this value serves as the upper bound over the whole time period , alice and bob reasonably achieve the secure message transmission with fixing the message rate @xmath95 mbps and the code length @xmath96 .",
    "for the curve of @xmath97 mbps ( dashed line ) , the required code length for @xmath93 is @xmath98 and still reasonable . on the other hand , as we raise the rate up to @xmath99 mbps ( solid line ) , which is close to the instantaneous secrecy rate @xmath100 mbps ( see fig .",
    "[ secrecyrate ] ) , @xmath101 of code word is required for @xmath102 . however , considering that the repetition rate is 10 mhz and the time slot duration is 4 ms , this code length is out of a consistent design .",
    "next and finally , we discuss finite length analysis in the larger fading case like in fig .",
    "[ secrecy2 ] . in subsection",
    "[ 43 ] , we have already discussed a fading resistant technique based on a code word over a longer time span , i.e. , the whole observation time of 200 ms .",
    "the input repetition rate was set as 10 mhz .",
    "this means that there are @xmath65 symbols in the whole span , and the code length is also @xmath65 .",
    "this length is however , considerably long , and readily causes large coding complexity . to reduce such complexity",
    ", one must set a lower repetition rate @xmath103 for a fixed observation time @xmath104 , where the code length @xmath1 is determined as @xmath105 .",
    "figure [ leakedinfo](b ) shows how fast the leaked information criteria @xmath92 decreases as the repetition rate @xmath103 for a given message rate @xmath16 .",
    "as easily imaged , if the larger message rate is required , the repetition rate must be higher for attaining a given level of secrecy , and hence the code length should also be longer according to @xmath105 .",
    "suppose that we set the secrecy criteria as @xmath93 .",
    "then for a message rate @xmath106 bits / letter , the repetition rate and the code length must be set roughly as @xmath107 khz and @xmath108 , respectively , which realizes the secure message transmission at 2 kbps . for a higher message rate",
    "@xmath109 bits / letter , the repetition rate and the code length should be @xmath110 mhz and @xmath111 , respectively , realizing the @xmath112 mbps secure message transmission .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the feasibility of phy security in real - field fso links . using tokyo fso testbed",
    ", we could gather the experimental data for various atmospheric conditions which will meet satellite - to - ground laser communications .",
    "we exploited three information theoretical quantities as performance measures , the secrecy rates , the secrecy outage probability and the expected code lengths for given secrecy criteria .",
    "we observed that the real conditions influence the temporal variation of the instantaneous secrecy rate ; the temporal variation is stable in the late evening time , whereas it is much stronger before the sunset time .",
    "when the variation of secrecy rate is stable , alice and bob can establish the secure message transmission with reasonable code lengths . on the other hand , when the variation of secrecy rate is much heavier , alice and bob can assess the possibility of secure message transmission using a good and longer code designed based on the long span statistics of the channel .",
    "quantitatively , they can calculate the probability of the fatal information leakage via the secrecy outage probability . combining the phy security with upper - layer cryptographic schemes",
    ", they may be able to establish secure communication even in the heavy fading condition .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly focused on the secure message transmission via the wiretap channel .",
    "as was stated , the opportunistic transmission may be impractical in the configuration of this paper since a fast adaptive optimization over input probability distribution , input power , and message rate is required .",
    "however , in the delay tolerant communication such as secret key agreement @xcite using public channels , this opportunistic approach will work effectively . in secret key agreement",
    ", alice and bob can opportunistically select appropriate time slots after sharing initial randomness , and apply information reconciliation and privacy amplification to the data in these time slots .",
    "moreover , the secrecy rate gives a lower bound for the achievable secret key rate .",
    "the experimental result gathered via tokyo fso testbed campaign tells us that the implementation of secret key agreement scheme in this testbed is straightforward .",
    "thus , the feasibility study of this scheme in real field fso communications will be a next target of this campaign .    with a direct analysis ,",
    "this study provides quantitative assessment of the key rate reduction from the eavesdropper in real channel conditions .",
    "this is a strong support for the further study of this effect with a mobile attack , as for instance in the case of eve on a drone .",
    "moreover , although our results were obtained in horizontal terrestrial propagation , we believe that our feasibility study is a first step towards a realization for large - scale deployment of phy security in fso communication .",
    "phy security in fso communication will open a new paradigm for the basis of high - capacity and high - altitude secure communications exploiting satellites , air planes and drones .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the bin width @xmath46 for evaluating the mutual information @xmath52 based on soft - decision decoding . the bin width for bob s output voltage histogram ( figs .",
    "[ secrecyrate ] and [ secrecy2 ] ) was also determined by the same procedure .",
    "ideally , one should make the bin width @xmath46 as finely as possible . in practice",
    ", however , the finite sample size of experimental data sets the lower bound on allowed values of @xmath46 . to determine such a lower bound , we investigate the bin width dependence of the mutual information @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ noiseoscillo ] . for large @xmath46",
    ", @xmath52 stays at a constant value which corresponds to the value for hard - decision decoding . on the other hand , as @xmath46 decreases ,",
    "the curve starts climbing steadily at 20 mv , and then reaches a plateau around at @xmath113 bit per letter , the value for soft - decision decoding .",
    "note that the noise equivalent power ( nep ) of eve s apd , 12 mv , is located in the slope of this increase . as @xmath46 decreases further",
    ", @xmath52 turns to increase again at around 0.3 mv .",
    "this is due to the lack of sample size , namely , one can artificially construct non - overlap distributions for the input signals 0 and 1 , which is of course a fake .",
    "hence , we adopt 0.3 mv as the bin width @xmath46 which is neither too large not to underestimate @xmath52 nor too small to mitigate the effect of limited sample size .",
    "in this appendix , we show that under the condition that both the input probability @xmath4 and input power are fixed over all coherence interval , and the main channel is almost error free , the long span secrecy rate @xmath114 outperforms the ergodic secrecy rate @xmath77 .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the mutual information @xmath115 is a convex function of transition probability @xmath22 with the fixed input probability distribution @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the following inequality holds from the jensen s inequality @xcite ; @xmath117 \\ge i(p , \\mathrm{e}[w ] ) .",

    "( [ fromconvex ] ) follows from the assumption that bob s channel is almost error - free and applying eq .",

    "the secrecy exponent @xmath87 is monotone strictly positive increasing in @xmath123 and becomes @xmath3 for @xmath124 .",
    "this is the manifestation of the tradeoff relation between information rate and secrecy @xcite : namely , for more secure communication , one should increase @xmath90 for the price of sacrificing the information rate @xmath26 .",
