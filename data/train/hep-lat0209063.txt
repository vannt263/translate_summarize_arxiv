    "the @xmath0 singlet state is an excitation of the vacuum .",
    "the complicated non - perturbative nature of the vacuum is one of the reasons that qcd is hard to solve at low energies .",
    "the precise computation of scalar meson masses via a first principles full qcd calculation would demonstrate that low energy qcd could be tamed .",
    "the work of many groups  @xcite has shown that the lightest @xmath0 state is 1611(30)(160 ) mev  @xcite in pure su(3 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "the priority now is to find evidence for glueballs in nature .",
    "this almost certainly requires an understanding of the mixing of glueballs with quark anti - quark states .",
    "experimentally , there are more singlet @xmath0 states in the region 1200 to 2000 mev than can be organised into su(3 ) nonets  @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the non - singlet @xmath0 states is also required to show there are additional degrees of freedom beyond @xmath1 states",
    ".    in full qcd all operators with @xmath3 = @xmath0 quantum numbers can mix .",
    "the singlet @xmath1 operator also has @xmath0 quantum numbers , hence these operators will mix with wilson loop @xmath0 operators used for glueballs in quenched qcd .",
    "the mixing of wilson loop and @xmath4 states has been studied in quenched qcd by lee and weingarten  @xcite .",
    "they claimed that in the continuum limit the mixing between wilson loop and @xmath1 @xmath0 states is small .",
    "constructive criticism of the lee - weingarten calculation is in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report results for the masses of singlet and non - singlet @xmath0 states .",
    "we use unquenched gauge configurations  @xcite with a smaller lattice spacing ( @xmath5 0.1 fm ) than our previous study  @xcite ( @xmath5 0.13 fm ) .",
    "to extract masses we use factorising ( or variational ) fits of @xmath6 exponentials to correlators of operators @xmath7 , @xmath8    using additional operators helps to stabilise the multi - exponential fit .",
    "we include @xmath0 operators made out of a quark and anti - quark and wilson loops in the same fit .",
    "this basis of operators should couple well to the glueball mixing .",
    "the wick contraction of the singlet @xmath1 operators requires the calculation of fermion loops  @xcite . @xmath9",
    "the correlator in equation  [ eq : singletmeson ] can be computed using @xmath10 noise techniques .",
    "we used 100 noise sources and the double source techniques described in  @xcite . in the fermion sector",
    "we use fuzzed  @xcite and local operators as basis states .",
    "two types of smeared wilson loop operators  @xcite were included .",
    "we use @xmath11 and 2 in this calculation .",
    "the non - perturbatively improved clover action was used to generate the configurations , with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and volume of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the configurations with sea @xmath15 and @xmath16 were used .",
    "we use @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) to label the singlet ( non - singlet ) @xmath0 states .",
    "the interpretation of the experimental spectrum of the @xmath18 hadrons is confused by the @xmath19 , that many people believe is a @xmath20 molecule  @xcite . in quenched qcd",
    "the @xmath18 channel is complicated by a severe quenched chiral artifact  @xcite , caused by the @xmath21 state being treated incorrectly in quenched qcd .",
    "one prediction  @xcite of the analysis of bardeen et al .",
    "is that the mass of the @xmath18 should not reduce smoothly with quark mass , but actually start to increase .",
    "this behavior was observed by lee and weingarten  @xcite , who saw the mass of the @xmath18 rise with quark mass below that of strange for small volumes ( less than 1.8 fm ) .",
    "other groups have seen similar behavior  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 channel was fitted using a variational basis of local and fuzzed operators .",
    "we do a partially quenched analysis , where the sea quark mass is fixed and the valence quark mass is varied .",
    "the partially quenched theory also has pathologies that tend to be less severe than for the quenched theory . in figure  [ eq :",
    "a0mass ] , we plot the mass of the @xmath22 and @xmath18 as a function of pseudoscalar mass squared , using @xmath23  @xcite to make a dimensional ratio , in both quenched ( @xmath24 ) and unquenched qcd . figure  [ eq : a0mass ] does show the quenched pathology predicted by  @xcite . the results in figure  [ eq : a0mass ] convince us that it is preferable to study the @xmath18 mass in unquenched lattice calculations .",
    "if we chirally extrapolate the @xmath18 mass for the unquenched data in figure  [ eq : a0mass ] to @xmath25 we get @xmath26 gev .",
    "more work is required to control the systematic errors on the mass of the @xmath18 , so that lattice qcd calculations can distinguish between the mass of the @xmath19 and @xmath27 .",
    "the results from unquenched qcd lattice calculations , with light quark masses and fine lattice spacings , should automatically include the physics of glueball @xmath1 mixing .",
    "however , the results from @xmath28 lattice calculations from the hemcgc  @xcite and sesam  @xcite collaborations did not show a large deviation of the masses of @xmath0 glueballs between quenched and unquenched qcd .",
    "hart and teper measured the glueball correlators , using only wilson loop interpolating operators , on this data set  @xcite .",
    "they found that the @xmath0 mass was significantly smaller in @xmath28 qcd , by a factor of ( @xmath30 ) , over quenched qcd at comparable lattice spacing . in figure",
    "[ eq : gluecont ] we plot the masses from the calculation by hart and teper ( diamonds ) with the masses obtained in this analysis ( bursts ) .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1 operators with the wilson loop operators has produced a further suppression of the mass of the @xmath17 at the lattice spacing we use .",
    "the combined use of both wilson loop and @xmath1 operators is clearly a superior technique for extracting masses than just using the wilson loop operators on their own , hence the result for the @xmath17 mass from this analysis is now the preferred result .",
    "figure  [ eq : gluecont ] shows the suppression of the mass of the @xmath17 between @xmath28 and quenched qcd is less at this new lattice spacing than our previous result at @xmath31  @xcite . to make physical predictions about the spectrum of the @xmath17 hadrons requires the continuum limit to be taken for the @xmath28 results . in quenched qcd",
    "it was found necessary to use a lattice spacing of 0.05 fm  @xcite , this size of lattice spacing will also be required for full qcd calculations that use the wilson gauge action .",
    "this will be computationally expensive  @xcite with clover fermions .",
