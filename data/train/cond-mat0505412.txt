    "dilute boson - fermion mixtures have been studied in several experiments by trapping and cooling gases of mixed alkali - atom isotopes @xcite .",
    "the boson - fermion coupling strongly affects the equilibrium properties of the mixture and can lead to quantum phase transitions ( for a review see @xcite ) . in particular , boson - fermion repulsions in three - dimensional ( 3d ) clouds can induce spatial demixing of the two components when the interaction energy overcomes the kinetic and confinement energies @xcite .",
    "this occurs in 3d if the fermion density is high or if the boson - fermion repulsion is strong , as shown in a phase diagram obtained by imposing pressure balance and equality of chemical potentials in coexisting phases @xcite .",
    "although spatial demixing has not yet been experimentally observed , the experiments of schreck _ et al . _",

    "collapse driven by increasing the number of bosons in a 3d trap has instead been observed in @xmath3rb-@xmath4k mixtures @xcite , where the interspecies interactions are attractive .",
    "on approaching a quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) situation , the fermi energy starts to increase linearly with the number of fermions per unit area , so that the linear stability condition of the mixture becomes independent of the fermion density and involves only the scattering lengths and the transverse width of the cloud . in this regime spatial demixing of a @xmath1li-@xmath2li gas",

    "@xcite for homogeneos boson - fermion matter has been extended by das @xcite to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) homogeneous mixture . in the 1d case",
    "the fermi energy is proportional to the square of the number of fermions per unit length , so that the mixed state becomes unstable at _ low _ linear fermion densities .",
    "the dependence of the kinetic pressure of the fermi gas on the fermion density becomes stronger with decreasing dimensionality , and in 1d a number of fermions above a threshold will want to occupy the whole available space irrespectively of the repulsions exerted by the bosons .",
    "similarly , it is easily shown that a 1d homogeneous mixture with attractive boson - fermion interactions is stabilized against collapse by the fermi pressure if the linear density of fermions is above the same threshold .    in this paper",
    "we examine the instabilities of a dilute boson - fermion mixture trapped inside a strongly elongated harmonic confinement . we give the general conditions under which various forms of demixing can occur in a q1d confined geometry in terms of the physical parameters of the system and draw a phase diagram at zero temperature in a plane defined by two scaling parameters .",
    "we support our analysis by extensive mean - field calculations of the equilibrium density profiles in a @xmath1li-@xmath2li mixture .",
    "we find that in the case of interspecies repulsions the stability condition which applies in the macroscopic limit is still approximately valid for full demixing in harmonic confinement .",
    "we next turn to the case of attractive interspecies interactions , where we search for a collapse instability by a variational approach patterned after the work carried out by miyakawa _",
    "@xcite on a 3d mixture .",
    "we find that our mean - field model does not allow collapse in a confined q1d geometry , but only predicts that the density profiles keep narrowing with increasing attractive coupling strength until the validity of the model is lost .",

    "we can study the equilibrium properties of the mixture at essentially zero temperature ( @xmath11 ) in terms of the particle density profiles along the @xmath12 axis , which are @xmath13 for the bose - einstein condensate and @xmath14 for the fermions .",

    "a linear stability analysis based on a mean - field energy functional predicts that the locations for demixing and collapse coincide and that the gaseous cloud is stable if the usual condition @xmath36 is fulfilled @xcite , with @xmath37 playing the role of an effective fermion - fermion repulsion due to the pauli pressure in the fermi gas .",

    "we have studied the boson - fermion interaction energy in a mesoscopic cloud as a function of a boson - fermion repulsive coupling and have given approximate analytical expressions identifying three critical regimes : ( i ) partial demixing where the boson - fermion interaction energy attains maximum value from a balance between increasing interactions and diminishing overlap ; ( ii ) dynamical demixing where the fermionic density drops to zero at the centre of the trap and a sharp dynamical signature of demixing may be expected ; and ( iii ) full demixing where the boson - fermion overlap is negligible as in the macroscopic limit .",
    "it is remarkable that in this model full demixing can be reached by simply _ decreasing _ the number of trapped fermions . in the region of phase separation",
    "we have found several metastable configurations for the demixed cloud , having various topologies but lying at higher energy above the stable configuration which is composed of a core of condensed bosons surrounded by fermions .",

    "i.e. _ upon _ lowering _ the fermion density .",
    "while a mean - field treatment is clearly unable to describe the full path to collapse , we have seen that it supports the above view .",
    "it would be interesting to study the q1d mixture with strong attractive interactions by using models beyond mean - field and with inclusion of three - body collisions .",
