    "electron spins carry much promise as state variables for scaled classical logic@xcite and as quantum bits ( qubits ) in quantum computer architectures.@xcite a key challenge of current research in spin - based electronics ( `` spintronics '' ) and quantum computation is to devise methods to probe spin polarization in semiconductors with weak spin - orbit coupling,@xcite like silicon and silicon - germanium alloys .",
    "silicon combines many special features that make its electronic spin a promising basis for classical and quantum logic devices : band structure properties such as weak spin - orbit coupling and indirect band gap , and the possibility of preparing a nuclear spin free environment lead to extremely long spin relaxation times in comparison to other semiconductors.@xcite    however , the same features that lead to long spin relaxation times also make spin detection more challenging .",
    "optical methods for spin detection such as faraday and kerr rotation have been used successfully in iii - v semiconductors,@xcite but unfortunately , these methods are inapplicable to silicon and related materials , whose spin - selective optical transitions are extremely weak and ineffective .    .",
    "our theory shows that doping with different types of group v donor species along the transistor channel enables the determination of the conduction electron spin polarization distribution along the channel .",
    "each donor species has a distinct set of hyperfine - split electron spin resonance frequencies , whose amplitude is directly proportional to the local carrier spin and donor electron spin polarizations.[device],width=288 ]    recently , injection and detection of conduction electron spin polarization was demonstrated in silicon . in ref .",

    "both experiments achieve spin detection at the interface , but no local or `` in - situ '' spin detection .",
    "the interface limits spatial resolution and introduces additional scattering effects . in studies with accumulation channel silicon transistors , spin - dependent scattering was demonstrated by electrical detection of magnetic resonance ( edmr).@xcite    in this article we present a theory of spin - dependent transport in the scattering of spin polarized conduction electrons in the two dimensional electron gas of field effect transistors . based on the scattering theory , we propose a donor - based approach to the problem of _ in - situ carrier spin detection in silicon_. at the limit of a single donor impurity , this mechanism also provides a path for the readout of single donor spin states that does not require proximity to ( or presence of ) charge traps.@xcite    consider a silicon transistor with a series of different group v donor impurities implanted along its conduction channel , fig .  [ device ] .",
    "spatially resolved characterization of carrier spin polarization is obtained by measuring the source - drain current when each donor species is in resonance with a microwave field .",
    "this is possible due to spin - dependent scattering ( sds ) , which relies solely on the symmetry of impurity scattering events.@xcite while this effect was believed to be observed through edmr in [ ] amidst competing heating effects , it was only recently that sds was confirmed experimentally using a small ensemble ( @xmath3 ) of implanted antimony ( sb ) donors.@xcite in the following , we present a general microscopic theory of sds , its efficiency and tunability in a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . we show that the core physical mechanisms underlying sds are virtual transitions mediated by negatively ionized donor levels .",
    "our results apply to all semiconductors , but are particularly useful as a probe of spin polarization in group iv and related materials with weak spin - orbit coupling , whose spin detection is intrinsically challenging .",
    "our physical optimization of this effect has exciting consequences for spintronics and single donor electron or nuclear spin readout.@xcite    we remark that sds is quite different from other edmr experiments based on spin - dependent recombination of electron - hole pairs.@xcite as showed by kaplan , solomon , and mott,@xcite spin - dependent recombination has important contributions that _ do not _ depend on carrier spin polarization @xmath0 . hence it is difficult to use recombination based edmr as a probe of carrier spin polarization @xmath0 .",
