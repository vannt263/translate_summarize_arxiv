    "the study of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition is a rapidly developing field in modern physics . for both experimental and theoretical investigations , colloidal dispersions",
    "are often chosen as model systems .",
    "compared to atomic liquids , the main advantages of such model systems rely on their simplicity : the particle interactions can often be described theoretically by quite simple and well defined expressions , and experimental investigations can be performed by applying standard optical methods in real space instead of neutron or x - ray scattering techniques .",
    "supercooled liquids close to the glass transition exhibit complex relaxation patterns which do not follow a simple exponential decay in time .",
    "the most successful theory for the description of the dynamics of supercooled liquids is the so - called mode - coupling theory ( mct ) which has been developed and studied in great detail by gtze and coworkers @xcite for various model systems in three spatial dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "the central prediction of mct is a transition from a liquid into an ideal glassy state upon decreasing temperature or increasing particle density below or above some critical value , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that many physical phenomena like equilibrium phase transitions depend strongly on the spatial dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , it appears to be essential to study the @xmath0-dependence of the liquid - glass transition as well .",
    "as far we know , the first experimental approach to this issue is the investigation of knig et al .",
    "@xcite of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) binary mixture of super - paramagnetic colloidal particles which are trapped on a water - air interface .",
    "they interact via repulsive dipole potentials . here",
    ", the magnetic dipoles have been induced by an external magnetic field perpendicular to the water interface which renders the repulsions isotropic in the interface plane .",
    "their results for the self - intermediate scattering functions measured by video microscopy clearly exhibit the stretched relaxation patterns of glass - forming liquids and the corresponding strong slowing down of the dynamics when increasing the magnetic field ( which plays the role of an inverse , effective temperature ) . this model system was also used for both experimental and theoretical studies on crystallization effects in the high - coupling limit , i.e. for large magnetic fields ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a further interesting phenomenon ( found experimentally and corroborated theoretically ) pertaining to the same model system in the liquid state is a partial clustering of the smaller particles in a sponge - like topology @xcite .",
    "the first mct calculations on a model system in 2d were performed by bayer et al .",
    "@xcite for monodisperse hard disks .",
    "an ideal glass transition has been found at a critical packing fraction @xmath1 .",
    "this study was extended to binary mixtures of hard disks @xcite characterized by the total packing fraction @xmath2 , the concentration of the smaller disks @xmath3 , and the size ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the same four mixing effects occur as have been reported before by gtze and voigtmann @xcite for binary mixtures of hard spheres in 3d : ( i ) for small size disparities the glass is stabilized , ( ii ) for large size disparities the liquid state is stabilized , ( iii ) upon increasing the concentration of the smaller particles the plateau values of the normalized correlation functions for intermediate times increase for almost all wave numbers accompanied by ( iv ) a slowing down of the initial part of the relaxation of the correlators of the bigger particles towards these plateaus . further , it was shown that the glass transition diagram for binary hard disks , i.e. the critical packing fraction @xmath1 as function of @xmath3 for several @xmath4 , strongly resembles the corresponding random close packing diagram .",
    "this fact is an indication for the validity of the mct approximations also in 2d .    in the present study",
    ", we will apply mct to a 2d binary liquid of dipoles .",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "first , we want to explore how far the mixing effects found for hard spheres @xcite and hard disks @xcite have some generic features .",
    "second , motivated by the experiments on quasi-2d binary mixtures of super - paramagnetic particles @xcite , we want to compare our mct results with available data . as a byproduct",
    ", we propose a simple empirical ansatz for the bridge functions @xcite appearing in the closure to the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation which allows for a rather precise determination of the equilibrium structure .",
    "the organization of our contribution is as follows .",
    "[ theory ] will contain ( i ) a justification of the model used to approach the experimental system , based on a comparison of the experimental and theoretical results for the static structure factors , ( ii ) a concise review of mct equations in @xmath0 dimensions , and ( iii ) the discussion of some properties of the glass transition lines .",
    "our results from mct will be presented and discussed in sect .",
    "[ results ] and the final sect .  [ conclusions ] summarizes and gives some conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the model being investigated , discuss some of its structural properties , and shortly review the corresponding mct equations . for more details on the latter",

    "@xmath5 is called positive ( semi-)definite , ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 if this is true for all @xmath7 .",
    "our starting point is the experimental model system studied by knig et al .",
    "technical details for the experimental setup can be found in ref .",
    "the authors consider a binary mixture of super - paramagnetic colloidal particles trapped on a water - air interface of a pending droplet , so that particle motion is effectively only possible in 2d . by applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the liquid interface , they can vary the strength of the repulsive dipolar interaction forces between the particles .",
    "temperature @xmath19 , total particle number density @xmath20 , radii @xmath21 and susceptibilities @xmath22 of the smaller ( @xmath23 ) and bigger ( @xmath24 ) particles are kept constant to good accuracy . to observe vitrification",
    ", the magnetic field is increased . accordingly ,",
    "the magnetic moments of the particles and the repulsions between them grow and in turn the correlations between the particles become stronger .    the colloidal dispersion is strongly diluted . to be more precise",
    ", the average distance between the particles exceeds the diameter of the bigger particles roughly by a factor of four @xcite , which yields the estimate @xmath25 for the total 2d - packing fraction on the interface plane .",
    "therefore , collisions of the hard cores of two particles practically never occur , at least for low enough temperatures . under this condition ,",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the experimental system is well determined by the induced dipole potentials , only .",
    "idealizing this picture , we assume a binary mixture of point particles in 2d interacting via the induced dipole potentials @xmath26 @xmath27 is the vacuum permeability and @xmath28 denotes the applied external magnetic field .",
    "although the hard core interactions have been neglected , the two species of particles shall be called `` big '' ( @xmath24 ) and `` small '' ( @xmath23 ) in the sense that @xmath29 .    the thermodynamic state of the considered system with fixed @xmath30 and @xmath31 depends on four variables : @xmath20 , @xmath19 , the concentration of the smaller dipoles @xmath3 , and the magnetic field @xmath28 . for a monodisperse dipolar system with susceptibility",
    "@xmath32 it is well - known that the dependence on @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath28 is given by the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath33 since we want to study mixing effects on the ideal glass transition , we have to compare e.g. the critical temperature @xmath34 or equivalently the critical filed @xmath35 for the binary system with concentration @xmath36 with a corresponding monodisperse system .",
    "as we will argue now it does not make sense for all @xmath3 to simply choose for that comparison the monodisperse system with susceptibility @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the interaction potentials for the specified model system enter the mct equations only via the static structure factors .",
    "thus , we need some accurate and efficient method for a systematic calculation of these objects .",
    "we have at least two possibilities .",
    "first , we can make use of the well established integral equation theory for the direct correlation functions @xmath45 based on the oz equation @xcite for mixtures @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the total correlation functions for given wave number @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath49 denotes the kronecker delta . to obtain e.g. @xmath50 , we need a closure relation .",
    "the general ansatz @xcite for this reads @xmath51=-u_{eff}^{\\alpha\\beta}(r)+h^{\\alpha\\beta}(r)-c^{\\alpha\\beta}(r),\\ ] ] @xmath52 @xmath53 are the pair distribution functions and @xmath54 are called the ( still unknown ) bridge functions .",
    "every specific closure relation relies on some ( uncontrolled ) approximation scheme for @xmath54 .",
    "the advantage of using an integral equation theory is , however , that data with high numerical quality can be produced .",
    "there is no statistic noise and there are no finite size effects like in atomistic computer simulations .",
    "furthermore , crystallization effects can explicitly be excluded .",
    "having found @xmath50 , the static correlation matrix @xmath55 follows from @xmath56    second , we can perform an atomistic computer simulation .",
    "since we are only interested in static quantities , the most efficient choice is the monte carlo ( mc ) technique .",
    "it yields exact numerical results in the sense that these do not rely on uncontrolled approximations .",
    "however , here are also some limitations . in order to study glassy behavior",
    ", we have to restrict the range of the control parameters such that no crystallization effects occur .",
    "furthermore , we need data with high numerical quality as input for mct . for instance , the violation of the strict positive definiteness of the static correlation matrix @xmath57 for a single @xmath16 already leads to instabilities in the numerical solution of the mct equations .",
    "such problems typically occur only for the atomistic computer simulation data at small @xmath16 where both statistical noise and finite size effects may become dominant .",
    "thus , we need a clearly defined way to smooth the numerical raw data such that @xmath58 is enforced .    , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 measured experimentally by ebert @xcite ( solid lines ) and the corresponding mc results ( dashed lines ) obtained with @xmath61 particles without data smoothing .",
    "]    now , let us come back to our specific model system .",
    "we are able to reproduce available experimental data for @xmath57 by performing mc simulations such that the deviations are smaller than the noise level of the experimental data . fig .",
    "[ fig_mc ] shows partial structure factors @xmath62 for a binary mixture of dipolar particles in 2d at @xmath63 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 measured experimentally by ebert @xcite . due to the finite polydispersity of both species of colloidal particles",

    "besides these technical artifacts , our mc results are in very good agreement with the experimental data .",

    ", the influence of the hard - core interactions of the particles seems to become significant in the experimental data . for larger",
    "@xmath72 , we would need larger system sizes and longer simulation runs in order to reproduce the experimental data .",

    "first , for @xmath73 the experimental system of knig et al .",
    "@xcite is very well described by the idealized model potentials given by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "second , we can be confident that our mc simulations with @xmath74 particles will yield sufficiently realistic results for our purposes , since the mct glass transitions discussed below occur within the parameter range @xmath75 .    using integral equation theory ,",
    "we have further analyzed several established choices for the bridge functions @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ bridge ] ) .",
    "the percus - yevick ( py ) ansatz , which has successfully been applied to systems with hard core interactions , fails in describing mc simulation data for our system .",
    "for instance , for a binary mixture with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , i.e. deep in the liquid regime , the py closure underestimates the position of the main peak of @xmath79 by about @xmath80 percent and overestimates the maximum value of this peak by almost @xmath81 percent . for higher values of @xmath72",
    "we have not found stable numerical solutions for the py structure factors .",
    "accordingly we do not know whether the quality of the py theory for our model system becomes better or even worse .",
    "at least for @xmath82 , py theory is much less reliable for dipolar potentials than for hard core interactions .",
    "the reason for this is not obvious .",
    "another choice is the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) approximation @xmath83 .",
    "this simple ansatz describes the positions of the main peaks of the partial structure factors correctly , but strongly underestimates their amplitudes ( see below ) , as already noticed by zahn @xcite and hoffmann @xcite .",
    "there are also more sophisticated closure relations . such relations , however , typically include free adjustable parameters .",
    "this fact makes these methods not only computationally demanding , but also makes the optimization procedure unwieldy if more than one adjustable parameter is used .",
    "the rogers - young ( ry ) closure , for instance , which interpolates between py and hnc , has in principle three fit parameters for the binary mixture .",
    "furthermore , the quality of the corresponding results is not satisfactory .",
    "3(a ) in ref .",
    "@xcite clearly shows that the ry closure underestimates the position of the main peak of the partial structure factors of the big dipoles .",
    "it also underestimates the amplitude of the oscillations beyond the main peak .    for our binary dipole model in 2d , we have found empirically that using hnc with temperature @xmath84 instead of @xmath19 leads to a systematic improvement in the description of experimental and simulated data for @xmath57 ( see below ) .",
    "a similar observation was made earlier independently by zahn @xcite .",
    "even more , it was observed by klapp @xcite that also simulation results for specific dipolar systems in 3d can be well fitted by using hnc with @xmath84 .",

    "this inequality between the experimental values for @xmath207 is also consistent with the fact that the mixture with @xmath208 and @xmath233 already shows a plateau whereas the mixture with @xmath209 and @xmath237 does not .",

    "of course , it is necessary to strongly extend the parameter range for @xmath3 , but also for @xmath4 , to test the validity of our mct predictions more systematically .",
    "performing such a systematic test has also to account for the overestimation of the temperature scale at which vitrification sets in . for @xmath76 and @xmath240 mct yields @xmath241 by both using @xmath84-hnc and mc structure factors as input . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ scatter ] , however , the development of a plateau as a precursor of a possible glass transition only becomes clearly visible in the experimental data for @xmath242 .",
    "hence , mct overestimates the scale for the glass transition temperature by about a factor of two , as well - known for other systems .",
    "the major motivation of our study has been to explore the effect of mixing on the ideal glass transition of a binary mixture of dipolar colloids in 2d and the comparison with corresponding experimental data .",
    "the calculations were done in the framework of mct .",
    "the mct equations were solved by using the static structure factors from mc simulations and integral equation theory . for the latter we have used the @xmath84-hnc closure relation because it does not involve adjustable parameters and fits the mc results for the partial static structure factors rather well .",
    "the very good agreement of the partial static structure factors from experiment @xcite with those from our mc simulation using dipolar point particles has demonstrated that the dipolar colloidal system is well modeled by point particles in 2d interacting only via the induced dipole potentials ( [ potential ] ) , at least in the parameter range where the glass transition occurs .",
    "the main result we have found is that the effect of mixing on the glass transition depends strongly on the liquid system .",
    "in contrast to binary mixtures of hard disks and hard spheres @xcite , mct for the binary liquid of point dipoles predicts always a stabilization of the liquid state due to mixing .",
    "more explicitly , for fixed temperature @xmath19 and fixed total particle density @xmath20 the critical magnetic field @xmath162 and accordingly the critical value @xmath163 of the magnetization per particle at which the binary dipolar liquid vitrifies is always larger , compared to a one - component system .",
    "the amplitude of this predicted plasticization effect is quite large , the gtls for @xmath76 shown in fig .",

    "the experimental data also show that mct systematically overestimates the scale for the glass transition temperature by more than a factor of two , which is a well - known phenomenon of mct @xcite .     for binary mixtures of dipolar particles in 2d at @xmath243 and @xmath77 calculated by using the @xmath84-hnc closure .",
    "]    at this point , let us also speculate about the physical origin of the predicted plasticization effect . as pointed out by hoffmann et al .",
    "@xcite , the smaller particles in the binary dipole model tend to form clusters whereas the bigger particles remain more homogeneously distributed in space .",
    "this partial clustering manifests itself by the occurrence of a prepeak in the partial structure factors @xmath66 of the smaller particles at low @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the cited clustering effect seems to occur as a generic feature of the binary dipole model : all partial structure factors @xmath66 with @xmath161 and @xmath36 used for calculating the glass transition lines in figs .",
    "[ fig_phase1]-[fig_phase3 ] exhibit a prepeak .",
    "on the other hand , mct predicts plasticization for all @xmath161 and @xmath36 where the only model specific input to mct are the partial structure factors @xmath62 .",
    "thus , it could be that the partial clustering of the smaller particles is the physical origin for the plasticization effect predicted by mct .    to investigate this conjecture in more detail , we have calculated @xmath84-hnc structure factors @xmath62 for @xmath243 , @xmath77 , and @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath212 , and @xmath246 from which the @xmath247 and @xmath248 elements are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cluster ] . the case @xmath244 is a monodisperse system close to its mct glass transition point which shows no clustering and by definition satisfies @xmath249 .",
    "now , by decreasing @xmath4 we observe five qualitative effects on @xmath250 : ( i ) a growing prepeak in @xmath66 at @xmath251 , ( ii ) a decrease in @xmath79 for @xmath252 , ( iii ) a decrease in the amplitude in the main- and the subsequent peaks in both @xmath79 and @xmath66 , ( iv ) a shrinking of the @xmath16 scale for the oscillations of @xmath79 , and ( v ) a stretching of the @xmath16 scale for the oscillations of @xmath66 . the plasticization effect predicted by mct",
    "must be a result from an interplay of these five effects .",
    "since these effects are competing , no definite conclusion can be drawn concerning the plasticization effect .",
    "thus , at least from our analysis here it is not obvious whether there is a connection between clustering and plasticization or not .",
    "we have also discussed some general properties of the glass transition diagram and its gtls . for small disparities in the susceptibilities ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath4 close to one , the gtls are symmetric like for binary hard disks @xcite .",
    "two gtls with @xmath170 and @xmath171 below @xmath253 must have an odd number of intersection points .",
    "this prediction is only based on the application of the analytical expression for the slope @xmath254 at @xmath164 and @xmath167 . furthermore , depending on @xmath4 the gtls exhibit either one maximum , for @xmath4 closer to one or @xmath4 very small , and two maxima with a minimum in between , for intermediate values of @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior also differs qualitatively from that of binary hard disks in 2d and binary hard spheres in 3d .    as a side result to be mentioned , with the @xmath84-hnc closure",
    "we have suggested a new bridge function approximation which is useful for calculating the static structure functions of dipolar systems .",
    "of course , our finding is only of empirical nature .",
    "the various properties of the gtls of binary liquids of point dipoles in 2d predicted here in the framework of mct are a challenge to be tested in more detailed numerical simulations and by extending the present experimental approach .",
    "but the theoretical approach can be extended as well .",
    "for instance , for the present model it will be interesting to study the fully time - dependent density correlators",
