    "at the les houches `` complex systems '' school we learned about spin glasses and methods by which to study their statistical properties ( g.  parisi ) , also the applications of statistical physics to combinatorial optimization problems were introduced ( r.  monasson ) . following the acquired knowledges we studied the average case of 1-in-3 sat problem .",
    "we applied rigorous methods to obtain algorithmic and probabilistic bounds on the sat / unsat and hard / easy transitions .",
    "we also employed the cavity method to obtain a more complete picture of the problem .",
    "our study went beyond a simple exercise , and led to several interesting results and a separate publication of three of the authors  @xcite .",
    "here we summarise shortly the methods and give the main results .",
    "1-in-3 sat is a boolean satisfaction problem .",
    "each formula consists of a set of variables and clauses , and each clause contains 3 literals .",
    "a clause is satisfied if exactly one of the literals is true , and the formula is _ satisfiable _ ( sat ) if there is any assignment of variables to true or false , such that every clause is satisfied .",
    "1-in-3 sat has important similarities to other constraint - satisfaction and graph - theoretical problems .",
    "it is a canonical np - complete problem  @xcite and thus relates to a host of practically relevant problems .",
    "in particular we consider here an ensemble of formulas parameterised by @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mean connectivity of variables in the ensemble , and @xmath2 $ ] is the probability that variables appear as a negative literal in the interactions .",
    "we then study the sat / unsat and easy / hard transition curves in this space , as the number of variables @xmath3 .",
    "this parameterisation is motivated by the knowledge that in many related problems there exists a sharp transition in the typical - case behaviour , from a sat to an unsat regime as the parameters are varied ; and a more heuristic easy - hard transition , where in a easy phase many `` local '' algorithms work in a polynomial time , whereas in the hard phase they need an exponential time .",
    "previous work in ( symmetric ) 1-in-3 sat ( @xmath4 ) demonstrated that sat / unsat transition is sharp at the threshold @xmath5 , and not accompanied by any hard region  @xcite .",
    "however , for exact cover ( i.e.  positive 1-in-3-sat , @xmath6 ) this threshold is difficult to determine , with only upper  @xcite and lower bounds  @xcite to the transition being known , and the presence of a hard region is suspected . studying the threshold behaviour in @xmath1 , for a continuum of problems parameterised by @xmath0 , allows us to better understand the origin of these differences and the nature of the two transitions .",

    "results are consistent with previous statements restricted to the special cases @xmath6  @xcite , and @xmath4  @xcite .    a rigorous analysis of the _ unit clause propagation _ ( uc ) and _ short clause heuristics _ ( sch ) algorithms  @xcite led to upper ( dashed line ) and lower ( shifted to @xmath9-axis ) bounds on the sat / unsat threshold .",
    "this result identifies two regions in which the problem is known to be easy - unsat and easy - sat , and surprisingly for @xmath13 the upper and lower bounds coincide , proving the existence of a range of @xmath0 in which , at all values of @xmath1 , formulas are almost surely easy .",
    "a second rigorous upper bound for the sat / unsat transition is obtained by considering the first moment method on the 2-core  @xcite , and a third one for the easy - unsat region by an algorithmic method of embedding formulas in the less constrained 3-xor - sat problem  @xcite ( out of scale in the figure ) .",

    "the other results on the phase diagram are obtained by the cavity method @xcite .",
    "we worked both in the assumptions of replica symmetry ( rs : existence of a single pure state ) and one - step replica symmetry breaking  @xcite ( 1rsb : existence of exponentially - many pure states ) .",
    "furthermore we checked the stability of the solutions thereby obtained  @xcite .",
    "the rs solution is able to identify the phase transition when @xmath0 is large , but is proven to be unstable at smaller @xmath0 ( solid line with triangle marks in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] ) .",
    "the 1rsb solution we explored describes clusters which contain solutions ( have zero energy ) and disregards their size ( entropy )  @xcite .",
    "a 1rsb solution of this kind exists in a region with @xmath15 , this gives an indication for the easy / hard - sat transition .",
    "the common interpretation is that the existence of many states ( clusters ) is an intrinsic ( i.e.  algorithm - independent ) reason for the average computational hardness  @xcite .",
    "the 1rsb solution is shown to be stable in a region with @xmath16 , surrounding the sat / unsat curve .",
    "thus we conjecture that this portion of the curve is determined exactly . in particular , we get for the threshold of the positive 1-in-3 sat @xmath17 , in accord with existing exhaustive search results @xcite but with much higher precision .",
    "there exists a region in which neither rs nor 1rsb assumptions appear to hold sway , in this region we can however guess that 1rsb , as a mean - field assumption , provides an upper bound to the sat / unsat transition curve  @xcite .",
    "several questions arise out of this study , also concerning the relation with previous works on 1-in-3 sat , exact cover and @xmath18-sat , both from statistical - physics and algorithmic perspectives .    the nature of the interactions , being highly constrained ( only @xmath19 out of @xmath20 configurations satisfy a clause , and fixing @xmath21 variables could violate a clause ) , leads to remarkable properties .",
    "the first of them is the success of clause - decimation methods ( uc and sch ) .",
    "the second one , quite unexpected , is the arising of `` hard contradictions '' : above the light gray region in figure , the solution to 1rsb cavity equations at zero energy becomes singular .",
    "the relative success of the sch algorithm by comparison with the rs cavity method is also a novel result .",
    "we found a region where sch is able to find a satisfying assignment almost surely in polynomial time , and yet from the statistical - physics point of view the replica symmetry is broken .",
    "other algorithmic issues should be investigated in the 1-in-3 sat problem .",
    "particularly , the performance of belief propagation  @xcite and survey propagation  @xcite ( related resp .",
    "to rs and 1rsb cavity interpretation ) .",
