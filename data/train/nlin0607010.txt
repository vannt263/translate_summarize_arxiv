    "since more than a century normal diffusion , characterized by a linear increase in time of the mean square displacement ( msd ) of an ensemble of moving particles , provides a paradigmatic example of a stochastic process . here",
    "the msd can be expressed by the ensemble average @xmath0 with an exponent @xmath1 , where @xmath2 holds for the position of a particle on the real line at time @xmath3 .",
    "however , exponents @xmath4 are also possible yielding two important examples of anomalous diffusion : superdiffusion with @xmath5 and subdiffusion with @xmath6 .",
    "more recently , the importance of anomalous diffusive regimes was realized not only in physics but also in chemistry , biology and economics .",
    "these regimes were found in theoretical models and experiments related , among others , to turbulence , amorphous semiconductors , porous media , surface diffusion , glasses , granular matter , reaction - diffusion processes , plasmas and biological cell motility , see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "parallel to this development low dimensional deterministic maps attracted much attention as simple models of anomalous dynamics which can be understood analytically @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of the stochastic processes generated by these maps is provided by the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the dynamical variables . in case of normal diffusion these pdfs exhibit gaussian forms , whereas for subdiffusion they yield tails with stretched exponential decay and for superdiffusion lvy power laws @xcite .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been worked out over the past few decades in order to explain anomalous diffusion .",
    "perhaps the most famous one is continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) theory , pioneered by the work of montroll , weiss and scher @xcite .",
    "their stochastic approach was later on adapted to sub- and superdiffusive deterministic maps @xcite .",
    "related maps were originally proposed by pomeau and manneville as simple models of intermittency @xcite .",
    "a classification of their dynamics was provided particularly by gaspard and wang combining stochastic with dynamical systems theory @xcite . exploiting the deterministic properties of these maps ,",
    "anomalous diffusion was further studied in the framework of the thermodynamic formalism @xcite , by means of periodic orbit theory @xcite and by spectral decomposition techniques @xcite . currently aging phenomena @xcite , non - ergodic behavior @xcite and infinite invariant measures @xcite are in the focus of investigations demonstrating that these simple models provide ongoing inspiration for important new research",
    ".    however , all of the above studies focused on specific values of control parameters only for which these maps are to a large extent analytically tractable .",
    "that generally the dynamics is more intricate was shown by calculating the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient of a piecewise linear one - dimensional map , which turned out to be fractal @xcite .",
    "similar behavior was detected in more complicated models like the climbing sine map @xcite , in experimentally accessible systems like particles bouncing on corrugated surfaces @xcite and in models of josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "these findings can be explained by the existence of deterministic dynamical correlations that are topologically unstable under parameter variation @xcite ; for a review see part 1 of ref .",

    "we show that a fractal parameter dependence of physical quantities is not only typical for low - dimensional periodic deterministic dynamical systems exhibiting normal transport laws but also for anomalous dynamics . as an example we study parameter - dependent subdiffusion in a simple deterministic map , however",
    ", our main arguments hold for a broad class of anomalously diffusive systems .",
    "a specific feature of our analysis is that it employs a blending of techniques from stochastic theory and the theory of dynamical systems . that way we wish to contribute to the microscopic foundations of a general theory of anomalous deterministic transport , which does not yet seem to be fully developed .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : the model is introduced in section [ model ] . as a rate of diffusivity we choose a generalized diffusion coefficient ( gdc ) , which generalizes the diffusion constant known from normal diffusion . in section [ numres ] we present results from computer simulations showing that the gdc has a nonmonotonic , irregular dependence on control parameters of the map .",
    "we give a qualitative explanation of this phenomenon by arguing that the gdc is a self similar - like , fractal function .",
    "the gdc is furthermore conjectured to be everywhere discontinuous . in section [ theory ]",
    "we briefly review ctrw theory . in section [ mod_theory ]",
    "we show that an amended version of it correctly describes the coarse functional form of the gdc .",
    "apart from fractal parameter dependencies , the map under consideration exhibits an interesting dynamical transition , which is studied in detail in section [ sup ] . in section [ ffp ]",
    "we compute the pdf of this map from simulations and analyze it by means of a time fractional diffusion equation .",
    "section [ ff ] finally outlines a deterministic approach for analyzing the fractal gdc , which is based on a taylor - green - kubo ( tgk ) formula for anomalous diffusion .",

    "this change in the microscopic scattering process is drastically amplified by the singular behavior of the pdf probably leading to a discontinuity in the gdc .",

    "as far as we know there is only one analytical result in the literature trying to predict the whole parameter dependence of the gdc of this map @xcite .",
    "however , as we will show the respective calculation needs to be modified in order to match to computer simulation results .",

    "this structure was generated by the invariant density of the single scatterers hence revealing an interesting interplay between microscopic scattering and macroscopic diffusion .",
    "a more detailed understanding of the gdc was finally provided in terms of an anomalous tgk formula , which again is a generalization of the tgk formula for normal diffusion .",
    "the structure of this formula points at intimate relations to infinite invariant measures , aging , and generalized de rham - type fractal functions .",
    "all these terms define very active topics of research .",
    "we thus hope that , along these lines , in future work more detailed relations between mathematical infinite ergodic theory and the physics of anomalous diffusive processes can be established .    in the present paper",
    "we have only studied a one - dimensional subdiffusive map , however , we expect these findings to be typical for spatially extended , low - dimensional , anomalous deterministic dynamical systems altogether .",
    "further studies may also focus on the relation between the anomalous tgk formula and ctrw theory , on a spectral analysis of the frobenius - perron operator of this model , and on analyzing a superdiffusive map by similar methods .",
