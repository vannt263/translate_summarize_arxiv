    "the variations of the other two angular components trivially vanish .    in the spirit of holographic renormalization ,",
    "the bulk coordinates are naturally split as @xmath124 , with @xmath125 , and the radial coordinate @xmath44 is interpreted roughly as an inverse energy scale from the dual field theory point of view .",
    "the quantities computed above are simply proportional to the @xmath80 and @xmath126 components of the one - point function of the ( perturbed ) dual stress - energy tensor .",
    "more generally , the expectation value of the boundary stress - energy tensor is dictated , via the quasilocal stress tensor @xmath127 , by the asymptotic behavior of the metric  @xcite : = _ r r^2 t_ij(r , x^k ) .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for the explicit expression of the quasilocal stress tensor .    for completeness",
    ", we present the results for the perturbation induced by the collapsing test shell on the one - point function of the boundary stress - energy tensor :    & = , + & = ( 1- ) , + & = , + & = ( 1 + ) , + & = + ^2 .",
    "all other components of @xmath128 not related by symmetry vanish .",
    "this calculation also uncovers an interesting effect : although the actual radial location of the test shell does not influence the energy and momentum density , there is an explicit dependence on @xmath118 in the spatial components , which corresponds to pressures and shear .",
    "in this work we have studied the collapse of a rotating shell of null test particles towards a five - dimensional rotating black hole in asymptotically ads spacetime with equal rotation parameters .",
    "we employed a perturbative approach by considering the aforementioned black hole geometry as a fixed background , and studying the ( linearized ) effects of a test shell preserving all the rotational symmetry of the spacetime .",
    "we first considered the nonrotating case , which is instructive because the linearized einstein equations can be solved exactly .",
    "the presence of the shell increases the total energy of the spacetime by an amount precisely equal to the mass of the shell . for the fully rotating case",
    ", we were only able to solve the perturbation equations asymptotically . nevertheless , this was sufficient to show that the introduction of a continuous and homogeneous distribution of ( noninteracting ) test particles preserving the @xmath94 symmetry of the equally rotating myers - perry - ads@xmath0 background is only consistent if the angular momentum parameter of the particles vanishes , @xmath66 , i.e. , if the shell is corotating with the background .    in practice , the noninteracting character of the test particles constituting the shell , which is sourcing the perturbations , translates into the shell equation of state being that of dust .",
    "the above conclusion implies that , if we want to consider a general @xmath129 case , we must add extra terms to the stress - energy tensor to alter the angular momentum of the black hole . roughly speaking",
    ", the perfect fluid form of the stress - energy tensor does not carry the appropriate charge to affect the spin of the black hole , and consistency of the linearized einstein equations for @xmath106 requires the introduction of additional forces .",
    "the angular momentum of the test shell should be given by an off diagonal element of the stress - energy tensor , namely @xmath130 .",
    "so one expects that at least some momentum flux is needed for consistency .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by an exact treatment that will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it seems very likely that our results for the five - dimensional equally spinning myers - perry - ads black hole generalizes to all odd higher dimensions , since the structure of the linearized equations remains unaltered .",
    "in particular , there should still be four independent equations governing the perturbations , even though the total number of degrees of freedom grows as @xmath131 .",
    "this is a consequence of the high degree of symmetry we impose on the perturbed spacetime .",
    "the specific case we studied has equal angular momenta in the two independent rotation planes but in less symmetric situations we expect similar results  @xcite",
    ". in particular , a thin dust shell in such a spacetime must be corotating ; otherwise , it must be composed of a nonperfect fluid .    as a byproduct of our studies",
    ", we derived explicit expressions for the change in mass and angular momentum of these spacetimes induced by the test shell though the gravitational perturbations it sources .",
    "the counterterm prescription we adopted  @xcite , also known as the quasilocal stress tensor formalism , reproduces the expected results . in any case , the expressions obtained , eqs .   and  , are generically valid for gravitational perturbations of these spacetimes that preserve the background angular symmetry and its ads asymptotics .",
    "this provides a hint that this procedure may also give consistent results in a nonlinear situation , e.g. , a backreacted collapse or bh collision in ads , provided the gauge is suitably chosen , namely that the spacetime is asymptotically locally ads .    a point worth mentioning",
    "is related to the explicit time dependence in the asymptotic solution found for the rotating case , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sol_hpsipsi2]-[eq : sol_htt2 ] ) . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "even though the full angular symmetry of the background is preserved by the perturbations considered , the birkhoff - jebsen theorem can be evaded in odd dimensions .",
    "therefore , the spacetime outside the test shell need not be static , or even stationary , as it turns out to be the case .    in this investigation",
    "we have resorted to gauge fixing in order to solve the perturbation equations .",
    "alternatively , we could have chosen to work with a gauge - invariant formulation , as done in ref .",
