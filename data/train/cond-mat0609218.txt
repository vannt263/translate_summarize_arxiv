    "rapid experimental progresses in realization of spinor condensates ho , stamper - kurn have generated fascinating opportunities to study the spin dynamics and magnetic properties of condensate atoms .",
    "the properties of spinor condensates under external magnetic field are investigated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the spin - exchange interaction plays an important role in these works , which is reminiscent of the exchange interaction responsible for interesting magnetic properties in solid .",
    "other interactions , due to much weaker than the exchange interaction , are in most cases ignored .    since the spin degree of freedom becomes accessible in an optical trap , the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction which arises from the intrinsic or field - included magnetic dipole moment @xcite",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "the dipolar coupling was first considered between atoms at different sites , based on the assumption that the spin - exchange interaction dominates the on - site interaction @xcite . due to its long range and vectorial characters ,",
    "more and more attentions are paid to this spinor dipolar condensate , for example , the ground state structure and spin dynamics were examined for this novel quantum system in a single trap cheng and in deep optical lattices @xcite .",
    "recently a major experimental breakthrough @xcite has been achieved in the condensation of chromium atoms @xmath1cr which possesses a large magnetic dipole moment of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the bohr magneton ) in its ground state .",
    "the dipolar interaction in this condensate is a factor of 36 higher than that for alkali atoms , which makes possible the study of many dipolar phenomena and new kinds of quantum phase transitions predicted by theory .",
    "indeed , the long - range and anisotropic magnetic dipole - dipole interaction in degenerate quantum gases has been shown to lead to an anisotropic deformation of the expanding cr - bec which depends on the orientation of the atomic dipole moments @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we mainly consider a rich set of macroscopic quantum phenomena occurred in different quantum phases of spinor dipolar condensate .",
    "these phases may be tuned via modifying the trapping geometry so that various effective strengths of the dipolar interaction can be achieved .",
    "based on the ground state structure of a spin-1 condensate with dipole - dipole interaction at zero temperature , macroscopic quantum tunneling and oscillations occur in different phases , which are quite similar to what happens in molecular magnets @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the dipolar spinor bec model for @xmath4 under the single mode approximation , taking as a starting point the spin system analogous to the magnetization tunneling in magnetic particles .",
    "the ground state structure of the system is summarized in section 3 for zero , longitudinal and transverse fields , respectively .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are devoted to analyze the macroscopic quantum phenomena in the ground state for different phases under longitudinal or transversal external fields , in which cases tunneling between magnetizations arise naturally .",

    "the external magnetic field induces quantum oscillations in the dipolar spinor condensate .",
    "the period of oscillation is shown to be @xmath121 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the topological term in the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) leads to the oscillation behavior of our system .",
    "we emphasize here the ground state ( or in the language of quantum field theory , the instanton vacuum ) of the condensate acquires a vacuum angle owing to the presence of the external magnetic field , which breaks the symmetry and changes the topology of the system . in a charge density wave ring - shaped conductor placed in an external vector potential field the magnetic susceptibility and the electrical conductivity oscillate as a function of the flux @xcite , while the voltage applied on the josephson junction induces the oscillation of the effective capacitance of the junction @xcite . in our system of investigation the macroscopic quantum effect manifests itself by the oscillation of the effective magnetic momentum @xmath122 as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the magnetization curve at zero temperature is stepwise due to the macroscopic quantum oscillation of the effective magnetic moment and the period of oscillation depends on the strength of the dipolar interaction @xmath54 uniquely .",
    "we show this oscillation period in figure 2 , together with the mathematical function @xmath120 .",
    "the functional integral approach presented here becomes necessary when environmental friction or dissipation is included , which amounts to the introduction into the euclidean lagrangian of an additional term describing the non - local interaction of the instantons @xcite .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the modulation period in the typical laboratory experiment on spinor condensates . for a condensate with @xmath123 sodium atoms @xmath124na and",
    "density @xmath125 @xcite we obtain the regular interval of magnetic field @xmath126",
    ". this oscillation period can be as small as @xmath127 for @xmath128 rubidium atoms @xmath129rb with density @xmath130 as in the first experimental achievement of bec in jila @xcite and can be as large as @xmath131 for @xmath132 chromium atoms @xmath1cr with density @xmath133 as in the latest dipolar condensate experiments in stuttgart @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be adjusted flexibly by changing the trapping potential geometry .",
    "now we prepare the system properly in region @xmath8 and apply a transverse field along the @xmath82-axis to the condensate .",
    "again we drop the constant terms and are left with the following effective hamiltonian@xmath134where @xmath135 .",
    "the model describes a quantum spin system with the easy - axis anisotropy while the external field is along @xmath82-axis .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in the context of spin tunneling .",
    "classically under the influence of a weak transverse field along the @xmath82 direction , the two energy minima move away from the zero filed positions ( @xmath136 or @xmath137 ) and towards @xmath82-axis while remaining in the @xmath48 plane . for @xmath138 , they are located at @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , with the angle @xmath141 between @xmath142 and @xmath50-axis .",
    "the degeneracy is removed when @xmath143 , where the system is completely polarized by the external field and the two minima merge along @xmath82-axis .",
    "quantum mechanically , the degeneracy is lifted before the magnetic field reaches @xmath144 due to the magnetization tunneling .",
    "a well - known consequence of the tunneling between two degenerate states is the lifting of their degeneracy : the two new eigenstates are a symmetric and an antisymmetric superposition of the original states characterized by an energy difference ( or tunneling splitting ) @xmath145 inversely proportional to the tunneling rate .",
    "the quantity of interest to determine the occurrence of tunneling is therefore this energy difference between the two lowest eigenstates of the hamiltonian .    to calculate analytically this energy splitting",
    ", we use the effective potential method @xcite  which maps the spin system onto a particle system and the result can be easily obtained with the periodic instanton method .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath146 in the @xmath56 representation takes the form @xmath147where @xmath148 and @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "let us introduce the generating function , @xmath151multiplying equation ( [ she ] ) by a factor @xmath152 and summing all terms with @xmath153 , we can transform the equation ( [ she ] ) into @xmath154    in order to remove the first derivative term , let us define a new function @xmath155 .",
    "when we replace @xmath156 with @xmath157 , the new schrdinger equation can be written after dividing by @xmath158 in the form@xmath159where the corresponding parameter @xmath160 describe the dimensionless energy @xmath161 , and @xmath162 is the effective potential well with @xmath163 .",
    "the value @xmath164 plays the role of the planck constant @xmath165 , the potential takes the form of a double well for @xmath166 , i.e. , for external magnetic field not exceeding the saturation value @xmath167 .",
    "the two local minima thus play the role of the degenerate classical states and the energy splitting of the lower states takes the following form according to @xcite@xmath168with the splitting for the ground state@xmath169here @xmath111 is the euclidean action evaluated along the trajectory from the left minimum @xmath170 to the right @xmath171 , @xmath172 is the small oscillator frequency near the bottom of potential well @xmath173 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the instanton trajectory determined the constant @xmath52 and @xmath174 .",

    "tunneling between two degenerate orientations of magnetization leads to the splitting of the `` non - tunneling '' ground state energy level into two levels separated by @xmath145 .",
    "correspondingly a very weak ac field of frequency @xmath178 will induce transitions between the two levels , which should result in the resonant absorption of the energy of the field .",

    "the level splitting can be greatly enhanced by a smaller number of atoms in the condensate and also by a stronger dipolar - dipolar interaction .",
