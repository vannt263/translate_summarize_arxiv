    "several years ago , in ref . @xcite some of us conjectured that a structural physical approximation ( spa ) of an optimal positive map is entanglement breaking , or , equivalently , that spa of an optimal entanglement witness is a separable state ( in general unnormalized ) .",

    "@xcite ) , both decomposable and indecomposable , and even studied in the continuous variables case @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly , in the indecomposable case it was recently disproved by ha and kye @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "had the latter been true , the conjecture would have been fully disproved .    the main aim of this note , which is a slightly modified version of the preprint @xcite released as a comment to ref .",
    "@xcite , is to show that the entanglement witness of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) is not optimal , and as such it is not a correct candidate to disprove the conjecture",

    "nevertheless , we still find the optimality analysis presented in this note valuable for researchers working in entanglement theory .",
    "first , it is in general not an easy problem to analytically decide on optimality of an ew , if it does not have the so - called spanning property .",
    "second , our note presents an instructive application of a powerful machinery for checking optimality of ews developed already in ref .",

    "clearly , for all normalized product vectors @xmath92 satisfying @xmath93 there always exists @xmath29 ( e.g. , @xmath94 with @xmath95 ) such that the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "it is obvious that the same holds for any @xmath58 , even arbitrarily small , and corresponding product vectors obeying ( [ war ] ) .",
    "one then needs to check whether ( [ inequality ] ) remains satisfied by those product vectors which do not obey ( [ war ] ) , i.e. , product vectors for which @xmath96 , where @xmath90 can be considered a free parameter that can be set arbitrarily small .",
    "a product vector @xmath34 obeying the latter inequality must then be `` close '' ( in the norm induced by the scalar product in @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 ) to one of the elements of @xmath31 .",

    "the four vectors @xmath149 read @xmath150 where the summation is modulo three and @xmath151 @xmath152 form the standard basis in @xmath153 .",
    "it straightforwardly follows from ( [ wit ] ) that this witness has a block - diagonal form @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is given by @xmath156 and acts on on the subspace spanned by @xmath157 @xmath152 .",
    "the three remaining blocks are rank - one matrices @xmath158 with @xmath159 @xmath160 being vectors spanning a subspace orthogonal to @xmath161 , with the latter , as it is indirectly stated in ref .",

    "let us finally mention that for any @xmath164 and @xmath165 , the witness has exactly one negative eigenvalue which comes from @xmath155 , while for @xmath166 , @xmath167 is an unnormalized projector onto @xmath168 , and therefore @xmath169 becomes a positive semi - definite matrix for any positive @xmath170 .",
    "we are now ready to show that @xmath171 is not optimal .",
    "first of all , one notices that @xmath161 of @xmath171 consists of only six vectors ( [ pwvecs ] ) , and therefore @xmath171 does not have the spanning property ( cf .",

    "one exploits the fact that @xmath191 @xmath192 with @xmath193 being a unitary operator such that @xmath194 @xmath152 , where addition is modulo three .",

    "one finally checks that @xmath201 all this means that @xmath202 for both pairs @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) is given by the same formula ( [ a2 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
