    "the far - infrared ( fir ) fine - structure emission line is the dominant gas coolant of the neutral inter - stellar medium ( ism ) in normal star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "it mostly arises from photo - dissociation regions ( pdr ) heated by ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation emitted by young , massive stars , and can account for up to a few percent of the total ir luminosity of a galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the efficiency of the ism cooling through this emission line is greatly reduced in systems with enhanced radiation field intensity and/or hardness caused by very intense nuclear starbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) indeed , compared with normal , quiescently star - forming galaxies , the relative cooling via the line with respect to that carried by dust , as measured by the /fir ratiom wavelength range as originally defined in @xcite . ] , decreases by more than an order of magnitude from @xmath3 in starbursting galaxies with warmer average nuclear dust temperatures and more compact star formation , such as in local luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath4 ) ( @xcite ) . in addition , in those sources where an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) may contribute to the fir emission of the galaxy , the /fir ratio can drop even further ( i.e. , there is a larger `` deficit '' ) , up to two orders of magnitude ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in our galaxy and the magellanic clouds ,",
    "emission arising from star - forming complexes and the diffuse ism have been studied in great detail ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , before the launch of the _ herschel space observatory _ ( @xcite ) , there was only a limited number of extra - galactic sources for which it was possible to disentangle the emission arising from spatially - resolved star - forming regions from that originating within their nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "now , the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) instrument on board _ herschel _ has enabled us to obtain measurements of the fir continuum and emission lines on physical scales of a few hundred pc in a significant number of nearby galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with which we are able to derive the properties ( 0 , ) of the different phases of the ism in extra - galactic star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "studying the extra - nuclear in nearby lirgs is critical not only for improving our understanding of the physical properties of the ism in star - forming galaxies , but also for establishing local benchmarks with which to compare measurements of this key emission line in distant ir - luminous galaxies . in fact",
    ", observations with pdbi and alma are already starting to find high - redshift galaxies in which is detected at distances several kpc away from their nuclei ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this letter is a follow - up to our work in @xcite ( hereafter ds13 ) , where we presented the results for our _ herschel_/pacs  survey regarding the nuclear emission of lirgs .",
    "here we study the extended line emission detected for the first time in a large sample of nearby lirgs . in section  2",
    "we briefly introduce the sample , observations and analysis of the data . in section  3",
    "we present our results , and in section  4 we summarize and discuss them .",
    "the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ; @xcite ) encompasses the complete luminosity - limited sample of the 202 lirgs and ulirgs contained in the _ iras _ revised bright galaxy sample ( rbgs ; sanders et al .",
    "2003 ) which , in turn , is a complete flux - limited sample of 629 galaxies having _ iras _ @xmath5jy and galactic latitudes @xmath6 .",
    "there are 180 lirg and 22 ulirg systems in goals and their median redshift is z = 0.0215 ( or @xmath7mpc ) .",
    "we have obtained _ herschel_/pacs fir spectroscopic observations of the emission line for 200 lirg systems ( 241 individual galaxies ) in the goals sample .",
    "details regarding the processing and analysis of the data are described in ds13 . since the goal of this letter is to analyze the deficit in the extra - nuclear regions of lirgs , in addition to the nuclear and fir fluxes calculated in ds13",
    ", we have also obtained their spatially - integrated fluxes as extracted from a @xmath8 spaxel box ( @xmath9/spaxel ) centered around the nuclear spaxel . the extended emission is thus defined as the integrated flux minus the nuclear measurement , after performing a point - source aperture - correction on the nuclear flux to the central @xmath8 spaxel aperture .",
    "the same approach was taken to calculate the extended emission of the 63@xmath10 dust continuum , which is also used to scale the _ iras _ fir flux and down to the apertures used to extract the pacs spectra ( see ds13 for more details ) .",
    "errors in the line and continuum fluxes have been propagated into the analysis of , e.g. , /fir . to calculate the ir luminosity surface density ( ) of the extended emission we use the projected physical area covered by the @xmath8 pacs spaxel box centered around the galaxy minus that of the nuclear spaxel . for the starburst nuclei , however , we use the beam - corrected mir sizes estimated from the spitzer / irs spectra and mips imaging , @xmath11 ( see ds13 ) .",
    "a galaxy is considered as spatially resolved when more than 30% of the and fir continuum flux is extended , as defined above .",
    "this threshold is robust against observations of unresolved sources in which mis - pointings of up to @xmath12 would introduce a systematic underestimation of the nuclear flux that would mimic extended emission available in hipev12 to estimate that a  3 mis - pointing within the central spaxel would increase artificially the fraction of extended emission only up to 23% . ] .",
    "because of possible contamination from a nearby companion galaxy , we exclude from this study lirg systems in which individual galaxies are closer than 23.5@xmath13 from each other ( 1/2 of the pacs fov ) . a total of 60 galaxies ( 25% of the sample ) show extended and fir emission meeting these constraints .",
    "their average extended emission is 52% , with a maximum of 75% .",
    "the projected radial distance at which the extended emission is detected ranges from 1 to @xmath1412.5kpc for the closest and farthest resolved galaxy , respectively , with a median of 4.3kpc . while more luminous goals systems tend to be located farther away , a k - s test comparing the distance and luminosity distributions of the goals galaxies with @xmath15 and those of galaxies classified as extended in this work , confirms that both sub - samples are indistinguishable in both quantities ( d - values of 0.20 and 0.15 and @xmath16-values of 0.04 and 0.22 , respectively ) .",
    "figure  [ f : ciifirvss63s100 ] shows the /fir ratio as a function of the @xmath1763@xmath18m/@xmath17158@xmath18 m continuum flux density ratio ( 63/158@xmath18 m hereafter)m into _ iras _",
    "60/100@xmath19 m can be found in the appendix of ds13 . ] for the extra - nuclear emission observed in spatially resolved lirgs in the goals sample . as expected ,",
    "the extended emission regions follow the trend found for the lirg nuclei ( ds13 ) suggesting that the deficit is related to the average temperature of the dust ( ) . however , the extended regions show smaller deficits ( stronger to fir emission ) and lower 63/158@xmath18 m ratios than the majority of the nuclei .",
    "the extended emission has a mean and median /fir ratio of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , which is a factor 2 larger than the lirg nuclei .",
    "figure  [ f : ciifirvss63s100 ] also reveals that the fractional extent of the emission does not correlate with the fir color of the extra - nuclear regions suggesting that galaxies with larger extended emission fractions do not have systematically colder or warmer . in the majority of lirgs",
    "the extended emission has 63/158@xmath18m@xmath221 and /fir@xmath1 , similar to those found in the extended disks of normal star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as in the diffuse component of the ism in the galactic plane ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with our previous findings based on _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectroscopy showing that the physical properties of the extra - nuclear , kpc - scale star formation in lirgs are very similar to those of normal star - forming galaxies with lower ir luminosities ( @xmath23 ) , and that the diversity of their integrated mir spectra is driven by the nuclear , few central kpc starburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the differences between the nuclear and extended emission are more clearly seen in figure  [ f : ciifirvsnucs63s100 ] , which shows that the ratio between the fir color of the extra - nuclear and nuclear regions is clearly correlated with the excess of deficit seen in the nuclei with respect to that observed in the disks , regardless of the distance at which the extended emission is measured or on the distance to the galaxy ( see color - coding ) .",
    "that is , for a given of the extended emission , lirgs with warmer nuclei show larger differences between their nuclear and extra - nuclear deficits .",
    "as shown in ds13 , there is a clear trend for pure star - forming lirgs having more compact ir emission to display lower /fir ratios .",
    "figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ] ( a ) shows that the extended emission regions in spatially - resolved galaxies follow an anti - correlation between /fir and similar to that seen for the lirg nuclei , with slopes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , suggesting that these correlations are likely driven by the same physical process",
    ". however , the extra - nuclear regions ( green filled circles ) are offset by more than an order of magnitude towards lower and show higher /fir ratios on average than their nuclei ( red open circles ) .    to understand this",
    "offset we can decompose it as a simultaneous shift in /fir and along the slope of the observed trend , plus an horizontal shift in .",
    "the shift along the correlation is determined by the ratio between the median /fir measured in the extra - nuclear regions and that of the starburst nuclei .",
    "the additional horizontal shift in represents the beam filling - factor of the star - forming regions in the lirg disks with respect to that of the nuclei .",
    "we estimate this relative filling - factor to be 0.06@xmath26 by minimizing the difference between the median of the extended and nuclear emissions ( see figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the filling factor account for the dispersion of the /fir vs. correlation in the x - axis as well as for variations in the properties of the ism that would modify the /fir ratio , such as changes in the fractional contribution of emission associated to the diffuse ionized medium . this methodology has been recently used in combination with the pdr models developed by @xcite to argue for the presence of large - scale star - formation in high - redshift galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these models relate the radius ( @xmath27 ) and of the starburst region to the strength of the uv inter - stellar radiation field ( isrf ) , measured in units of the local galactic value ( 0=1.6@xmath28ergs@xmath29@xmath30 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we can compare the relative beam filling - factor of the extra - nuclear star - forming regions derived from figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ] to that predicted by the models .",
    "@xcite consider two geometric configurations for the starburst region .",
    "one in which the molecular clouds are immerse in a smooth isrf and another in which a central , ionizing source is surrounded by a geometrically - thick , molecular medium . each one follows a relation such that @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively , with @xmath33 being the mean free path of a uv photon within the starburst region .",
    "if we assume a hydrogen density , , in the range of @xmath34 , we can use figure  4 of @xcite , which is based on the pdr models from @xcite , to estimate the /fir ratio as a function of 0 . although neither model fits our observed trend of /fir with",
    ", the model with a compact , nearby ionizing source , i.e. , @xmath35 ( dashed line in figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ] ) , is closest to our data .",
    "if we use m82 as our reference starburst ( with the following properties : @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xcite ; @xmath38pc , @xcite ) , the beam filling factor predicted by this configuration for the extra - nuclear star - forming regions would be @xmath39% that of m82 .",
    "this value is significantly lower than our inferred 6% , when we compare them to the lirg nuclei using the observed correlation in figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ] .",
    "we explore the reasons for this discrepancy below .",
    "the difference between the filling factor derived from our data and that estimated using the pdr models is due to the slope of the trend found for the lirg nuclei , which is still significantly shallower than that implied by the pdr model . using the relationship between /fir and 0 in ( @xcite )",
    ", a spatial distribution of the star formation of @xmath32 is equivalent to log(/fir)@xmath40log(@xmath41 ) ( see dashed line in figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ] ) .",
    "this significantly differs from the slope fitted to the data , @xmath42 .",
    "the difference in the slopes may arise at least in part from the fact that as the radiation field becomes more intense , not only the gas heating efficiency is reduced due to the increased ionization of small dust particles but dust grains could also be intercepting a larger fraction of the uv radiation before it reaches the pdr ( see @xcite ) . since this dust will be warmer , the natural consequence is also a smaller size for the starburst , as measured in the mir , and hence a larger .",
    "in fact , the /fir ratio is correlated with the depth of the 9.7@xmath10 silicate absorption feature ( ds13 ) , which measures the obscuration towards the warm dust continuum originating from the nuclear star - forming regions .",
    "it is therefore a combination of a decreased heating efficiency plus warm dust inside the pdr and likely within the regions , that causes a drop in /fir and a rise in . in these dusty sources , other fir emission lines arising from the dense ionized gas ( e.g. , , , or )",
    "also show deficits with respect to the fir emission ( @xcite ) , suggesting that a significant amount of dust may indeed be present inside the regions . the pdr model presented in figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ]",
    "not only has a steeper slope than the trends observed for the nuclei and extended regions of local lirg , but the majority of the nuclear data , mostly above @xmath43 , are located to the right of the model prediction . since the model assumes a constant filling - factor of unity for the starburst region , this implies a beam filling - factor for the lirg nuclei increasingly larger than unity .",
    "a possible interpretation is that , at a given /fir ratio , we can consider the trend with found for the lirg nuclei as `` maximal '' , i.e. , where the nuclear starbursts have the highest most compact possible , with multiple star - forming regions overlapping along the line of sight within the beam",
    ".    these findings may be useful for studies of ir - luminous galaxies detected in high - redshift surveys for which it is not possible to resolve the or ir emission .",
    "as an example , in figure  [ f : ciifirvsigmair ] ( b ) we show hfls  3 ( @xcite ) , a near - maximal starburst galaxy at @xmath44 , and two sub - millimeter galaxies , hdf  850.1 ( @xcite ) and aless  73.1 ( @xcite ) , at @xmath45 and 4.76 , respectively . all galaxies have a deficit and broadly consistent with the extrapolation of the correlation derived from the nuclei of local lirgs ( ds13 ) .",
    "we note that the of the high-@xmath46 sources may actually be underestimated because their sizes are measured in the rest - frame fir continuum , which is dominated by the cold dust .",
    "but if the reported sizes are correct , the offset of hfls  3 and hdf  850.1 may imply beam filling - factors for the star - forming complexes @xmath47 times larger than local lirg disks would have with similar /fir  or , alternatively , these high-@xmath46 sources would be showing properties similar to those of local ulirg nuclei in goals , but extended over larger physical scales .",
