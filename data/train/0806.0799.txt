    "among the many methods that have been developed to enumerate combinatorial structures , the role of the _ eco method _ has been growing in the last decade , thanks to its intrinsic simplicity and to the effectiveness of the combinatorial constructions it generates . the variety of problems in which the eco method has shown its soundness ranges from enumerative and bijective combinatorics to random and exhaustive generation .    the roots of the eco method can be traced back to @xcite , where the authors study baxter permutations and introduce for the first time the concept of a _ generating tree_. successively , west @xcite introduced the notion of a _ succession rule _ to give a formal description of generating trees in the context of permutation enumeration and barcucci , del lungo , pergola and pinzani @xcite extended the technique of generating trees , finding a general way of constructing combinatorial objects which can be often described using such formal tools .    the _ classical eco method _ ( a detailed description of which can be found , for instance , in @xcite ) consists of a recursive construction for a class of objects by means of an operator which performs a  local expansion \" on the objects themselves .",
    "typically , starting from an object _ of size @xmath0 _ , an eco construction allows to produce a set of new objects , _ of size @xmath1 _ , in such a way that , iterating the construction , all the objects of the class are obtained precisely once .",
    "if the construction is sufficiently regular , it can be often described by means of a _ succession rule _ , which is a system of the form @xmath2    the meaning of what is written above is the following .",
    "each object of the class is given a label @xmath3 .",
    "when performing the eco construction , an object labelled @xmath3 produces @xmath4 new objects labelled , respectively , @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the object of minimum size has label @xmath6 ( which is called the _ axiom _ of the succession rule ) . to have a graphical description of a succession rule one usually draws its _ generating tree _",
    ", that is the infinite , rooted , labelled tree whose root is labelled @xmath6 ( like the axiom ) and such that each node labelled @xmath3 has @xmath4 sons , labelled @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "it is evident from this definition that we can introduce a notion of _ level _ on generating trees , by saying that the root lies at level 0 , and a node lies at level @xmath0 when its parent lies at level @xmath8 .",
    "we remark that , from the above given definition , a node labelled @xmath3 has precisely @xmath4 sons .",
    "when a succession rule has this property it is often said to be _",
    "consistent_. however , one can also consider succession rules ( and generating trees ) in which the value of a label does not necessarily represent the number of its sons , and this will be frequently done in the sequel .",
    "moreover , we would like to warn the reader that , even if we will sometimes give definitions using consistent succession rules ( since this is the convention when working with the eco method ) , we will constantly make use of succession rules which are not necessarily consistent .    from the enumerative point of view",
    ", the main information encoded in a generating tree ( and thus in its associated succession rule ) is given by the _ level polynomial _",
    "@xmath9 , defined by setting @xmath10 equal to the number of nodes labelled @xmath4 at level @xmath0 , and by the _ associated integer sequence _ @xmath11 , which is defined , in terms of the level polynomials , as @xmath12 , and represents the total number of nodes at level @xmath0 .",
    "we point out that the infinite lower triangular array @xmath13 , sometimes called the _ agt matrix _",
    "@xcite , or _ eco matrix _",
    "@xcite , often happens to be a _",
    "riordan array _ @xcite . by definition",
    ", this means that every element @xmath10 can be expressed by using a pair of formal power series @xmath14 in such a way that it is precisely the coefficient of @xmath15 of @xmath16 . in this case , many counting properties of the generating tree can be found in an algebraic way , by using the related theory .    to give a quick example , consider the succession rule @xmath17 defining catalan numbers @xmath18 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the first levels of its generating tree can be depicted as follows :    ( 100,100 ) ( 50,90)(0,0)2 ( 25,70)(0,0)2 ( 75,70)(0,0)3 ( 10,50)(0,0)2 ( 40,50)(0,0)3 ( 60,50)(0,0)2 ( 75,50)(0,0)3 ( 90,50)(0,0)4 ( 5,30)(0,0)2 ( 15,30)(0,0)3 ( 35,30)(0,0)2 ( 40,30)(0,0)3 ( 45,30)(0,0)4 ( 55,30)(0,0)2 ( 65,30)(0,0)3 ( 70,30)(0,0)2 ( 75,30)(0,0)3 ( 80,30)(0,0)4 ( 85,30)(0,0)2 ( 90,30)(0,0)3 ( 95,30)(0,0)4 ( 100,30)(0,0)5 ( 27,72)(5,4)20 ( 73,72)(-5,4)20 ( 12,52)(3,4)11 ( 38,52)(-3,4)11 ( 62,52)(3,4)11 ( 75,53)(0,1)14 ( 88,52)(-3,4)11 ( 6,32)(1,4)3.5 ( 14,32)(-1,4)3.5 ( 36,32)(1,4)3.5 ( 40,32)(0,1)14 ( 44,32)(-1,4)3.5 ( 56,32)(1,4)3.5 ( 64,32)(-1,4)3.5 ( 71,32)(1,4)3.5 ( 75,32)(0,1)14 ( 79,32)(-1,4)3.5 ( 86,32)(1,4)3.5 ( 90,32)(0,1)14 ( 94,32)(-1,4)3.5 ( 98,32)(-1,2)7    here the level polynomials are @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the usual ballot numbers . notice that , in this example , by shifting the column index @xmath4 by two positions , it can be shown that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the generating function of catalan numbers . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we can compute the row sums and the weighted row sums of @xmath23 , thus obtaining the basic data for evaluating the probability distribution of the labels in the generating tree .",
    "the eco method has been fruitfully applied to several problems , not only of an enumerative nature .",
    "for instance , using this technique it has been possible to develop efficient algorithms for the random @xcite and exhaustive @xcite generation of combinatorial objects .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the authors describe a general exhaustive generation algorithm ( working for a wide family of structures ) defining gray codes not depending on the specific nature of the objects to be generated , but only on the properties of a succession rule encoding an eco construction for the objects under consideration . due to its plentiful applications ,",
    "it is then worth exploring in a deeper way the features and capabilities of such a method .    despite its wide range of applicability",
    ", there are many combinatorial constructions which can not be naturally described by using the classical eco method ( and classical succession rules ) as exploited above .",
    "for instance , in @xcite a generalization of the method is considered , allowing succession rules in which the labels are pairs of integers ( rather than integers ) .",
    "applications of this generalized method to the enumeration of pattern avoiding permutations are shown in the cited paper .",
    "a very strong limitation in the possibility of describing a combinatorial construction by means of a succession rule lies in the definition we have given of this fundamental tool .",
    "the generating tree of a succession rule has the property that , if the level of a node is @xmath0 , then the level of all its sons is @xmath1 . from a combinatorial point of view",
    ", this means that a ( classical ) eco construction performed on an object of a given size produces objects of the successive size .",
    "however , it may well happen that a combinatorial construction , having all the reasonable features to be called eco , does not behave in the standard way with respect to the notion of size .",
    "more precisely , starting from an object of size @xmath0 , we can construct new objects whose sizes are greater than @xmath0 ( but not necessarily equal to @xmath1 ) .",
    "the formalization of these concepts leads to the notion of what can be called a _ mixed succession rule_. roughly speaking , the idea is to consider a set of ( possibly different ) succession rules acting on the objects of a class and producing sons at different levels . to be more formal ,",
    "we introduce here the simplest instance of this general situation , by considering two succession rules producing their sons at the two successive levels .",
    "these will be called _ doubled mixed succession rules_. given two succession rules @xmath24 as in ( [ omega ] ) and @xmath25 we define the _ doubled mixed succession rule associated with the pair @xmath26 with axiom @xmath27 _ to be the succession rule @xmath28 , defined by @xmath29    the generating tree associated with @xmath28 has the property that each node labelled @xmath3 lying at level @xmath0 produces two sets of sons , the first set being @xmath7 at level @xmath1 and the second one being @xmath30 at level @xmath31 ( so that it produces a total of @xmath32 sons ) .    to justify our interest in this kind of notion , we remark that instances of ( general ) mixed succession rules have occasionally surfaced in some previous works ; to cite only one example , in @xcite vexillary involutions are enumerated by making use of a specific mixed succession rule .",
    "the first systematic treatment of mixed succession rules has been undertaken in @xcite , where the special case @xmath33 has been examined in great detail .",
    "the present paper represents the first attempt to tackle the general case , aiming at developing a general theory of mixed succession rules .",
    "more precisely , the main goal would be to succeed in expressing the sequence associated with a mixed succession rule @xmath28 in terms of the sequences associated with @xmath24 and @xmath34 , possibly changing the axioms .",
    "for this reason , in section [ prodrule ] we study some enumerative properties of what we have called _ production rules _ , which are , by definition , succession rules without the axiom .",
    "the problem of studying mixed succession rules in its full generality seems quite difficult ; it is somehow related to the theory of power series in several _ noncommuting _ variables . here",
    "we deal only with a special case , namely when the two rule operators ( see section [ preliminari ] ) of @xmath24 and @xmath34 commute . in this situation , we are able to find a general formula for the sequence associated with @xmath28 ; moreover , we also describe some examples our theory can be applied to .",
    "we would like to remark that this problem has also been considered from the point of view of riordan arrays @xcite .",
    "each riordan array determines a specific sequence @xmath35 , called the _ @xmath36-sequence _ of the array , such that , for every @xmath37 : @xmath38    when the @xmath36-sequence contains integer numbers only , it is related to the succession rule of an associated generating tree ( if any ) as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , it can happen that the @xmath36-sequence has a complicated expression , whereas the @xmath36-matrix ( as defined in @xcite ) is simple .",
    "this corresponds to an eco construction in which the elements of size @xmath0 produce objects of different sizes ( greater than @xmath1 ) .    in closing this introduction , we recall some notations we will frequently use in the next pages .    the sets of natural and real numbers will be denoted @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .    the following linear operators on the vector space of one - variable polynomials will be often considered : @xmath41 ( respectively , @xmath42 ) is the operator of multiplication by @xmath43 ( respectively , @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 is the usual derivative operator , and @xmath46 is the _ factorial derivative operator _ , which is , by definition , the linear operator mapping @xmath47 into @xmath48 ( for @xmath49 ) and 1 into 0 .",
    "given a succession rule @xmath24 as in ( [ omega ] ) , we can associate with it a linear operator on the vector space of one - variable polynomials @xmath50 $ ] , to be denoted @xmath51 ( the subscript will be omitted when it is clear from the context ) . to define such an operator",
    ", we use the canonical basis @xmath52 : @xmath53\\longrightarrow k[x ] \\\\&:&1\\longmapsto",
    "x^a \\\\&:&x^k \\longmapsto x^{e_1 ( k)}+\\cdots + x^{e_k ( k)},\\qquad \\textnormal{if $ k$ appears in $ \\omega$ , } \\\\&:&x^h \\longmapsto hx^h , \\qquad \\textnormal{otherwise.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as it is easy to understand , each enumerative property of @xmath24 can be suitably translated into some property of @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath11 is the numerical sequence associated with @xmath24 , for any @xmath55 the following equality holds : @xmath56_{x=1},\\ ] ] where we have used square brackets to denote the operator of evaluation at a specific value .",
    "the linear operator @xmath54 is called the _ rule operator _ associated with @xmath24 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the definition , the main properties and some applications of this notion",
    ".    _ remarks . _    1 .   in the above definition we have denoted with @xmath57 a generic fields of coefficients . for what concerns us here ,",
    "it is largely enough to take @xmath58 .",
    "actually , all the theory of rule operators could be equally developed on the semiring module @xmath59 $ ] of polynomials with nonnegative integer coefficients .",
    "2 .   if @xmath60 is the @xmath0-th level polynomial of @xmath24 , it is @xmath61    _ examples .",
    "_ here are some examples of rule operators associated with more or less well - known succession rules .",
    "all these examples can be found , for example , in @xcite .    1 .   a succession rule for factorial numbers : @xmath62 associated rule operator : @xmath63 2 .   a succession rule for arrangements : @xmath64 associated rule operator : @xmath65 3 .   a succession rule for involutions : @xmath66 associated rule operator : @xmath67 4 .   a succession rule for bell numbers : @xmath68 associated rule operator : @xmath69    further examples involving the factorial derivative operator @xmath46 can be considered .",
    "* a succession rule for catalan numbers : @xmath70 associated rule operator : @xmath71 * a succession rule for motzkin numbers : @xmath72 associated rule operator : @xmath73",
    "with the expression _ production rule _ we will mean here a succession rule without its axiom .",
    "hence the generic form of a production rule is @xmath74    clearly , in the same way a succession rule determines a unique numerical sequence , a production rule defines a family of sequences @xmath75 , depending on the axiom @xmath6 which we choose for the rule ( [ produzione ] ) .    from now on , given a succession rule @xmath24 as in ( [ omega ] ) , we will denote with @xmath76 the associated rule operator , @xmath6 being the axiom of @xmath24 . using this terminology ,",
    "given a production rule as in ( [ produzione ] ) , the family of operators @xmath77 will be called the _ family of rule operators _ associated with the production rule . in this section",
    "we will be interested in finding formulas to relate the various sequences associated with the same production rule .",
    "to this aim , we start by observing the following ( very easy but quite important ) facts .    1 .   for any @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 , when @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 . for this reason , in what follows , for @xmath80 , we will simply write @xmath83 , without specifying the axiom , and we will speak of _ the _ rule operator associated with the production rule whenever we restrict our attention to the subspace @xmath84 $ ] ( i.e. the subspace spanned by the positive powers of @xmath43 ) .",

    "this should allow , at least in principle , to obtain an expression for@xmath88 in terms of known quantities ( namely @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , with @xmath96 ) .",
