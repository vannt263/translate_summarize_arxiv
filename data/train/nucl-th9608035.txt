    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is generally accepted as the underlying theory of the strong interaction . at low energies relevant to nuclear physics ,",
    "however , nucleons and mesons are convenient and efficient degrees of freedom . in particular ,",
    "relativistic field theories of hadrons , called quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) , have been quite successful in describing the bulk and single - particle properties of nuclei and nuclear matter in the mean - field and dirac  brueckner  hartree  fock approximations@xcite .",
    "qhd studies based on renormalizable models , however , have encountered difficulties due to large effects from loop integrals that incorporate the dynamics of the quantum vacuum@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` modern '' approach to renormalization @xcite , which makes sense of effective , `` cutoff '' theories with low - energy , composite degrees of freedom , provides an alternative .",
    "when composite degrees of freedom are used , the structure of the particles is described with increasing detail by including more and more _ nonrenormalizable _ interactions in a derivative expansion@xcite .",
    "we seek to merge the successful phenomenology of the qhd approach to nuclei with the modern viewpoint of effective field theories .",
    "the present work is an extension of refs .",
    "@xcite , which explored some aspects of incorporating qcd symmetries into effective hadronic models . here",
    "we build a more complete effective lagrangian and apply it to nuclei at the one - baryon - loop level .",
    "our two main goals are to include effects of compositeness , such as single - nucleon electromagnetic structure , in a unified , self - consistent framework and to test whether `` naive dimensional analysis '' ( nda ) and naturalness ( see below ) are useful concepts for effective field theories of nuclei . eventually , we will need to demonstrate a systematic expansion scheme that includes corrections beyond one - loop order",
    "nevertheless , ref .",
    "@xcite describes how a general energy functional with classical meson fields can implicitly incorporate higher - order contributions .",
    "we therefore expect that higher - order many - body effects can be absorbed into the coefficients of our one - loop energy functional when we determine parameters by fitting to nuclear observables .",
    "we return to this point later in this section .",
    "important physical constraints on the effective lagrangian are established by maintaining the symmetries of qcd .",
    "these include lorentz invariance , parity invariance , electromagnetic gauge invariance , isospin , and chiral symmetry .",
    "these symmetries constrain the lagrangian most directly by restricting the form of possible interaction terms . in some cases",
    ", the magnitude of ( or relations between ) parameters may also be restricted .",
    "chiral symmetry has been known to play an important role in hadronic physics at low energies since the early days of current algebra @xcite ; it is exploited systematically in terms of effective fields in the framework known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite . there is also a long history of attempts to unite relativistic mean - field phenomenology based on hadrons with manifest chiral symmetry .",
    "in particular , it has been tempting to build upon the linear sigma model @xcite , with a light scalar meson playing a dual role as the chiral partner of the pion _ and _ the mediator of the intermediate - range nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) attraction .",
    "the generic failure of this type of model has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , a light scalar is completely consistent with a _ nonlinear _ realization of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a nonlinear realization , one need not assume that the hadrons are grouped into particular chiral multiplets @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological success of chpt establishes the dominant contributions of the vector resonances to the low - energy constants in the pion sector@xcite .",
    "in particular , a tree - level effective lagrangian with vector mesons is found to be essentially equivalent to chpt at one - meson - loop order . in the baryon sector , a satisfactory description of the nucleon form factors from vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite alone has not been found@xcite .",
    "however , we _ can _ describe the long - range parts of the single - nucleon form factors ( that is , magnetic moments and mean - square radii ) using an effective lagrangian that includes vector mesons and direct couplings of photons to nucleons .",
    "our approach is analogous to that implemented long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in virtually all previous qhd calculations of finite nuclei ,",
    "the single - nucleon electromagnetic structure was incorporated `` by hand . '' after the nuclear structure calculation was completed and `` point - nucleon '' densities were obtained , they were convoluted with empirical single - nucleon form factors to compute the charge density .",
    "the results were typically insensitive to the nature of the form factor , as long as the nucleon charge radius was accurate . in the present work ,",
    "we do not need external form factors .",
    "the large oscillations in the point - nucleon charge density of a nucleus are significantly reduced by virtual mesons inherent in the model , and the low - momentum parts of the charge form factors of various nuclei are well reproduced .",
    "thus we have a _ unified _ framework .    to achieve a systematic framework for calculating nuclei , however",
    ", we must develop an expansion scheme .",
    "chpt is an expansion in powers of small external momenta and the pion mass .",
    "weinberg@xcite applies this small - momentum expansion further to a calculation of the @xmath0-nucleon `` effective potential '' , defined as the sum of all connected diagrams for the @xmath1 matrix ( in time - ordered perturbation theory ) without @xmath0-nucleon intermediate states . on the other hand",
    ", an expansion of the nn interaction kernel in terms of intermediate states of successively shorter range provides a successful and economical way to accurately describe nn scattering data @xcite .",
    "here we combine the ideas of the small - momentum expansion and the intermediate - state expansion by including the low - lying _ non - goldstone bosons _ into the low - energy effective lagrangian .",
    "these bosons account for the intermediate - range interactions and conveniently describe the nonvanishing expectation values of nuclear bilinears such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "there are well - defined resonances in the vector channels , and thus it is natural to identify them with fields in the effective lagrangian ; in contrast , the dynamics in the scalar channel is more complicated .",
    "numerous calculations@xcite show that correlated two - pion exchange leads to a distribution of strength in the isoscalar - scalar channel at center - of - mass pion energies of roughly 500 to 600  mev , even in the absence of a low - energy resonance .",
    "we therefore introduce an isoscalar - scalar meson as an _ effective _ degree of freedom to simulate this strong interaction , just like the non - goldstone bosons in the vector channels .",
    "such a scalar , with a mass of 500 to 600  mev , is essential in one - boson - exchange models of the nn potential @xcite and in relativistic mean - field models of nuclei@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that at the level of approximation used in this paper , the scalar field can be introduced without loss of generality .",
    "( for example , it can be viewed as a way to remove terms with more than two nucleon fields from a general pion - nucleon lagrangian . )",
    "a deeper understanding of the nn interaction in the scalar channel is an important pursuit , but is not needed for our purposes here .",
    "we shall expand our effective hadronic lagrangian in powers of the fields and their derivatives , and organize the terms using `` naive dimensional analysis '' ( nda)@xcite . the nda framework is used to identify the dimensional factors of any term . after these dimensional factors and some appropriate counting factors are extracted , the remaining _ dimensionless _ coefficients are all assumed to be of order unity .",
    "this is the so - called naturalness assumption .",
    "if naturalness is valid , the effective lagrangian can be truncated at a given order with a reasonable bound on the truncation error for physical observables .",
    "thus we have a controlled expansion , at least at the tree level .",
    "evidently , for an expansion in powers of the fields and their derivatives to be useful , the naturalness assumption must hold .",
    "implicit in this assumption is that all the short - distance physics is incorporated into the coefficients of the effective lagrangian ; otherwise , the truncation error will not be reliably given by nda power counting when loops are included .",
    "thus , just as in chpt or in heavy - baryon theories , the nucleon vacuum loops and non - goldstone - boson loops will be `` integrated out '' , with their effects buried implicitly in the coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , the nucleon and non - goldstone - boson fields are still needed in the lagrangian to account for the valence nucleons , to treat the mean fields conveniently , and to apply the usual many - body and field - theoretic techniques .",
    "any contributions from vacuum nucleon or non - goldstone - boson loops that arise in many - body calculations can formally be cancelled by the appropriate counterterms .",
    "these cancellations can always be achieved , since _ all possible interaction terms consistent with the symmetries are already included in the effective lagrangian .",
    "_ on the other hand , long - distance , finite - density effects should be calculated explicitly in a systematic application of the effective lagrangian .    in principle , the naturalness assumption can be verified by deriving the effective lagrangian from qcd . since this is not yet feasible , one must fit the unknown parameters to experimental data . at finite density",
    ", however , the fermi momentum enters as a new scale .",
    "this complicates the situation , because a treatment of the effective lagrangian at the level of classical meson fields and valence nucleons ( the dirac ",
    "hartree approximation ) implies that several different physical effects are implicitly contained in the parameters .",
    "not only are short - distance contributions from meson and nucleon vacuum loops absorbed , but long - distance , many - body effects from well - known ladder and ring diagrams are included approximately as well @xcite .",
    "thus the usefulness of nda , the naturalness assumption , and the expansion in powers of the fields and their derivatives requires further examination when these ideas are applied to problems at finite density .",
    "it is not obvious that an effective lagrangian with natural coefficients that include only short - distance physics will remain natural in a one - loop calculation that accounts for higher - order many - body effects by adjustments of the coefficients .",
    "here we rely on fits to the properties of finite nuclei to determine whether the coefficients are natural and our expansion of the lagrangian is useful .",
    "( friar and collaborators have recently investigated naturalness as exhibited by a mean - field point - coupling model@xcite . ) an important topic for future study is to include the many - body dynamics explicitly , so as to disentangle it from the short - range and vacuum dynamics already implicit in the parameters of the low - energy effective lagrangian .",
    "the interaction terms of the nucleons and the non - goldstone bosons can be quite complicated , and different forms have been used in various models in the literature @xcite .",
    "some of these models are actually equivalent if one uses the freedom of field redefinitions@xcite , which leave the on - shell @xmath1 matrix invariant@xcite .",
    "we discuss how to take advantage of this freedom to simplify the interaction terms between the nucleons and the non - goldstone bosons . as a result",

    "next , we discuss the introduction of neutral vector and scalar mesons that are used to provide an efficient description of the short- and mid - range nucleon  nucleon interaction . to use the resulting lagrangian , which in principle has an infinite number of terms",

    "we find @xmath127 it is well known that the isoscalar - vector @xmath103 meson is needed to describe the short - range repulsion of the nn interaction . to have a realistic description of nuclear systems , the @xmath103 meson should be included .",

    "the effects of the vector @xmath137 in the isoscalar - vector channel can be absorbed into @xmath129 , as discussed near the end of sec .",

    "the contribution of this latter term is absorbed into the renormalization of @xmath129 . in general , one",
    "need only keep the lowest - lying meson in a given channel at low energy .",
    "unlike the vector channels , the absence of well - defined , low - lying resonances in the isoscalar - scalar channel makes the dynamics more difficult to identify and to model .",
    "it is well known from the empirical nn scattering amplitude@xcite , from one - boson - exchange models of the nn interaction@xcite , and from fits to the properties of finite nuclei @xcite that there is a strong , mid - range nn attraction arising from the isoscalar - scalar channel , with a range corresponding to a mass of roughly 500 mev .",
    "it has also been shown in calculations based on either phenomenological scattering amplitudes @xcite or explicit chirally symmetric models @xcite that an attraction of the appropriate strength can be generated dynamically by correlated two - pion exchange between nucleons .",
    "no nearby underlying resonance at the relevant mass is needed . nevertheless , this dynamics is efficiently , conveniently , and adequately represented by the exchange of a light isoscalar - scalar degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , in analogy to what we did with the vector mesons , we will introduce an effective scalar meson with a yukawa coupling to the nucleon to incorporate the observed mid - range nn attraction , and thereby avoid the explicit computation of multi - loop pion contributions . based on the results of the two - pion - exchange calculations and the success of one - boson - exchange models ,",
    "it is sufficient to give the scalar a well - defined mass , which we will choose here by fitting to properties of finite nuclei .",
    "moreover , the light scalar is a chiral singlet , so it does not spoil the chiral symmetry of the model .",
    "in addition to the evidence from the nn interaction , one can ask what other information exists on the dynamics in the isoscalar - scalar channel . a natural place",
    "to look is the physics of broken scale invariance in qcd .",
    "this leads to an anomaly in the trace of the qcd energy - momentum tensor and also to `` low - energy theorems '' on connected green s functions constructed from this trace @xcite . in pure - glue qcd",
    ", these low - energy theorems can be satisfied by introducing a scalar glueball field ( `` gluonium '' ) with a mass of roughly 1.6 gev .",
    "when light quarks are added and the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , the trace anomaly can acquire a contribution in addition to that from gluonium . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we considered this additional contribution to arise from the self - interactions of the light scalar mentioned above , and used the low - energy theorems to constrain these interactions .",
    "the lagrangian , which contained the light scalar , heavy scalar ( glueball ) , and other degrees of freedom , was scale invariant , except for some minimal scale - dependent self - interactions among the glueballs and the light scalar .",
    "since the glueballs are heavy , they can be integrated out along with other heavy particles and high - momentum modes .",
    "if one assumes no mixing between the scalar and the glueball , the scalar potential is constrained to satisfy the low - energy theorems ( at tree level ) , and the potential is given by@xcite @xmath145 here @xmath146 is the vacuum expectation value of the light scalar field @xmath1 , @xmath147 is its mass , and @xmath1 is assumed to have scale dimension @xmath58 ; that is , when @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "if we introduce the fluctuation field @xmath150 and expand @xmath151 as a power series in @xmath137 , the coefficients are all determined by the three parameters @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite showed , however , that finite - nucleus observables are primarily sensitive only to the first three terms in this expansion ; thus , even in this extremely simple model of the scale breaking , the low - energy theorems do not place significant constraints on the self - interactions of the light scalar field .",
    "if we allow for the possibility of scalar  glueball mixing and employ field redefinitions to simplify the interaction terms between the light scalar and the nucleons , the form of the potential @xmath151 can be modified and additional parameters need to be introduced .",
    "therefore , to take advantage of a simple yukawa coupling to the nucleon , we adopt here a general potential for the scalar meson , which can be expanded in a taylor series : @xmath152 here we have anticipated the discussion of naive dimensional analysis in the next subsection by including a factor of @xmath153 for each power of @xmath137 ; these factors are then eliminated in favor of @xmath154 .",
    "various counting factors are also included , as discussed in the next subsection .",
    "if the naturalness assumption is valid , the parameters @xmath155 , @xmath156 ,   should be of order unity .",

    "@xmath156 ,   adjusted to fit experimental data , we can account for all of the contact terms .",
    "the only relevant questions are which implementation allows for the most efficient truncation and how many terms are needed in practical calculations .",
    "we shall not include an isovector - scalar field in our effective lagrangian since the nn interaction in that channel is weak @xcite .",
    "there is no meson with these quantum numbers with a mass below 1  gev , and two ( identical ) pions in a @xmath161 state can not have @xmath162 .",
    "the lagrangian constructed thus far is based on symmetry considerations and the desire to reproduce realistic electromagnetic and nn interactions while keeping pion - loop calculations to a minimum .",
    "we have illustrated the lowest - order terms in powers of the fields and their derivatives , but in principle , an infinite number of terms is possible , and we must have a meaningful way to truncate the effective lagrangian for the theory to have any predictive power .    a naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) for assigning a coefficient of the appropriate size to any term in an effective lagrangian has been proposed by georgi and manohar@xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of `` naturalness '' is that once the appropriate dimensional scales have been extracted using nda , the remaining overall dimensionless coefficients should all be of order unity .",
    "for the strong interaction , there are two relevant scales : the pion - decay constant @xmath163 and a larger scale @xmath164 , which characterizes the mass scale of physics beyond goldstone bosons .",

    "the difference is not important for verifying naturalness but can be relevant for @xmath169 counting arguments @xcite .",
    "as noted by georgi@xcite , rule  1 states that the amplitude for generating any strongly interacting particle is proportional to the amplitude @xmath170 for emitting a goldstone boson .",
    "rule  2 can be understood as an overall normalization factor that arises from the standard way of writing the mass terms of non - goldstone bosons ( or , in general , the quadratic terms in the lagrangian ) .",
    "for example , one may write the mass term of an isoscalar - scalar field @xmath171 as @xmath172 where the scalar mass @xmath147 is treated as roughly the same size as @xmath168 . by applying rule  1 and extracting the overall factor of @xmath165 ,",

    "after the dimensional nda factors and some appropriate counting factors are extracted ( such as @xmath176 for the @xmath177 power @xmath178 ; see below ) , the naturalness assumption implies that any overall dimensionless coefficients should be of order unity .",
    "without such an assumption , an effective lagrangian will not be predictive .",

    "] it is reassuring that the preceding values are indeed consistent with phenomenology .    according to nda , a generic term in the effective lagrangian involving the isoscalar fields and",
    "the nucleon field can be written as ( generalizing to include the pion , rho , and photon is straightforward ) @xmath189 which includes @xmath190 nucleon bilinears , @xmath191 scalar fields , @xmath59 vector fields , and @xmath192 derivatives .",
    "gamma matrices and lorentz indices have been suppressed .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath54 is dimensionless [ and of @xmath173 if naturalness holds ] .",
    "numerical counting factors for terms with multiple powers of meson fields are included because the nda rules are actually meant to apply to the tree - level amplitude generated by the corresponding vertex .",
    "thus , a term containing @xmath193 , for example , should have a factor @xmath194 associated with it .",
    "these additional factors are certainly relevant when , say , @xmath195 . an explicit illustration of the origin of the counting factors can be found in the pion mass term in chpt : @xmath196 an important feature of the effective lagrangian is that each derivative on a field is associated with a factor of @xmath166 . thus organizing",
    "the lagrangian in powers of derivatives can be a good expansion for describing processes where the dominant energies and momenta are not too large .",
    "nevertheless , this organization is intimately connected with the important issue of how to remove redundant terms in the effective lagrangian . by employing the freedom to redefine the fields , one can organize the lagrangian such that there are no terms with @xmath197 acting on a boson field or @xmath198 acting on a fermion field , _ except _ in the kinetic - energy terms .",
    "these field redefinitions do not change the on - shell @xmath1-matrix elements@xcite .    in finite - density applications",

    "short - distance effects due to heavier particles , high - momentum modes , and dynamical vacuum contributions are assumed to be integrated out , so that their consequences appear only indirectly in the coefficients of the lagrangian .",
    "derivatives on the non - goldstone fields are already small compared to their masses in our applications because the momenta are limited by the fermi momentum .",
    "thus , we do not need to eliminate these derivatives .    instead",

    ", no changes occur to the ranges of the one - boson - exchange interactions in free space .",
    "all other heavy boson - exchange contributions are short - ranged , so we can efficiently parametrize them using meson self - couplings .",
    "we can easily show the invariance of the one - loop energy functional under field redefinitions , although a general proof to all orders seems difficult .",
    "it is still convenient to use the field redefinitions to remove all derivatives on the nucleon fields except in the kinetic term .",
    "these derivatives can be large because valence - nucleon energies are of the order of the nucleon mass @xmath65 .    at finite density",
    ", the fermi momentum appears as a new scale and meson fields develop expectation values .",
    "we must then also decide how to organize the nonderivative terms .",
    "the key observation is that at normal nuclear - matter density ( or in the center of a heavy nucleus ) , the scalar and vector mean - fields are typically @xmath199 and the gradients of the mean fields in the nuclear surface , where they are largest , are @xmath200 ( note that the _ magnitudes _ of the mean fields are reduced in the surface . ) equations  ( [ eq : fdest ] ) and ( [ eq : derest ] ) are our basis for estimating the leading contributions to the energy of any term in our lagrangian .    to summarize , the assumption of naturalness and the observation that the mean fields and their derivatives are small compared to @xmath65 up to moderate densities allows us to organize the lagrangian in powers of the fields and their derivatives .",
    "we will take advantage of the freedom to redefine the fields to simplify the interaction terms between the nucleons and the non - goldstone bosons .",
    "for the nucleons , pions , and photons , we use field redefinitions to remove high - order derivatives , whereas the scalar and vector meson parts of the lagrangian can contain powers of @xmath197 in addition to the kinetic terms , since these terms are small . by truncating the lagrangian at a given order in @xmath201 , we have a finite number of parameters to determine through fitting to nuclear observables .",
    "based on the preceding discussion , we illustrate here how nonlinear field redefinitions allow us to simplify the terms involving interactions between the non - goldstone bosons and the nucleons .",
    "derivatives on the nucleon field other than the kinetic term are removed by redefining the field because these derivatives on the nearly on - shell nucleons are of @xmath202 .",

    "a similar observation holds for the isoscalar - vector and the isovector - vector couplings .",
    "a term of the form @xmath207 is irrelevant because the baryon current is conserved .",
    "moreover , a coupling of the form @xmath208 can be removed from the hamiltonian by using the constraint equation for the vector field . the identity @xmath209 and the equations of motion allow us to reduce a term of the form @xmath210 in the lagrangian to a sum of yukawa and tensor terms and the term in ( [ eq : dv ] ) in the hamiltonian .",
    "as noted , bilinears in the nucleon fields and derivatives acting on such bilinears can be eliminated in favor of low - mass non - goldstone bosons .",

    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : five ]    experience with a broad class of relativistic mean - field models shows that models that successfully reproduce bulk properties of finite nuclei share characteristic properties in infinite nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "these properties are the equilibrium binding energy and density , the compression modulus @xmath353 , the value of @xmath354 at equilibrium , and the symmetry energy @xmath355 .",
    "one further condition is that the light scalar mass satisfies @xmath356 .",
    "this condition ensures reasonably smooth charge densities , good surface - energy systematics , and an appropriate shape for the single - particle potentials @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed from the properties of nuclear matter predicted from our fits to finite nuclei , as shown in table  [ tab : five ] for the parameter sets in table  [ tab : one ] .",
    "it is instructive to examine the contributions to the energy of nuclear matter from various terms in the energy density .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twelve ] , where the contributions to the energy per nucleon at equilibrium from the quadratic , cubic , and quartic powers of the fields @xmath261 and @xmath262 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nuclmatt ] ) are indicated separately .",
    "we set the scale for the natural size of contributions expected from an @xmath177-order term using the power counting estimate [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : generic ] ) ] for an @xmath177-order contact term and the approximation @xmath357 , with @xmath358 being the baryon density and the bracket indicating an expectation value .",
    "these estimates are marked with crosses , and the error bars reflect a range of @xmath168 from 500  mev to 1  gev .",
    "we observe that the estimates are consistent with the field energies found from the fits .",
    "furthermore , these estimates also set the scales for the mean meson fields , which are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdest ] ) .",
    "this is an indication that the naturalness assumption is valid ( see below ) .",
    "several observations can be made based on the figure :    * the contributions decrease steadily with increasing powers of the fields , so that a truncation is justified .",
    "note that this decrease will become more gradual as the density is increased above equilibrium density .",
    "* the nuclear matter binding energy ( indicated by the arrow ) is an order of magnitude smaller than the individual @xmath312 contributions .",
    "this implies that the @xmath312 scalar and vector contributions cancel almost completely and also that @xmath126 contributions are still quite significant ( at least for set g1 ) .",
    "* the @xmath221 contributions [ see eq .  ( [ eq : fifth ] ) ] are representative results obtained when the @xmath126 fit is extended .",
    "( they correspond to the lowest values of @xmath300 ) .",
    "they are not well determined ; almost identical values of @xmath300 can be found for very different @xmath221 parameters .",
    "nevertheless , even when unnatural @xmath221 parameters are introduced , their _ net _ contribution to the energy is typically a few tenths of an mev .",
    "thus a truncation at @xmath126 is consistent and adequate .",
    "* the systematics of the two parameter sets at @xmath126 are quite different",
    ". set g1 parallels the systematics of the standard parameter sets from refs .",
    "@xcite , while the @xmath126 terms for g2 are quite small .",
    "this is possible because of the contributions from the @xmath219 and @xmath220 terms , which involve gradients of the meson fields and thus do not contribute in nuclear matter .",
    "the contributions of these gradients [ note the signs of the @xmath359 and the signs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlag ] ) ] to the spin - orbit splittings in finite nuclei allow set  g2 to accurately reproduce the empirical spectra , even though @xmath360 in nuclear matter is larger than in conventional models .",
    "if we return now to the parameters in table  [ tab : one ] , we see that while the yukawa couplings and the scalar mass are close for the two sets , the meson self - couplings are very different .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier hartree calculations @xcite , which showed that the bulk and single - particle observables of interest are determined to a large extent by a relatively small number of nuclear properties .",
    "as noted above , by reproducing five important properties of nuclear matter and by choosing an appropriate scalar mass , one essentially fixes the predicted properties of doubly magic nuclei , and thus the thirteen parameters in the present model are underdetermined .",
    "the parameters are therefore highly correlated and are sensitive to the relative weights chosen for the observables , including the spin - orbit splittings . to determine the parameters better , one must include additional observables that are sensitive to different aspects of the dynamics .",
    "to explore these issues further and to put our @xmath126 fit in perspective , it is useful to find parameter sets for more constrained truncations .",
    "if we optimize with the `` standard '' mean - field model , which includes the yukawa couplings , the scalar mass , and @xmath155 and @xmath156 , we find @xmath361 , and the parameter set ( which we label q1 ) is qualitatively close to the `` best - fit '' sets of the past and also to the corresponding parameters of set g1 ( see table  [ tab : one ] ) . adding the @xmath126 vector self - interaction , with parameter @xmath352 ,",
    "improves the @xmath300 to about 90 ( set q2 ) .",
    "the @xmath300 values of sets g1 and g2 are slightly less than 50 , so it is clear that a better fit is obtained with more parameters , but not dramatically so .",
    "if we truncate our model at @xmath312 ( set w1 ) , keeping only the yukawa couplings and the scalar mass and setting all other parameters to zero , the best @xmath300 is over 1700 .",
    "the `` optimal '' set in this case depends strongly on the relative weights , because only a subset of the observables can be reproduced accurately .",
    "the standard choice @xcite has been to reproduce the charge radii accurately at the expense of significant underbinding .",
    "the present set of weights leads to much better binding energies ( despite a large compressibility ) but the systematics of the charge radii ( oxygen in particular ) is badly reproduced .",
    "the spin - orbit splittings are too large in all cases , corresponding to a low value for @xmath360 ( see table  [ tab : five ] ) .    at @xmath77 ( set c1 ) , we add two parameters , @xmath155 and @xmath349 .",
    "( we hold @xmath351 at zero for simplicity . )",
    "if the number of parameters was the sole key to a good fit , we would expect @xmath300 to be comparable to that from the standard models .",
    "however , the best fit has @xmath362 . in practice",
    "the @xmath349 contribution plays the same role as @xmath156 if one looks at energy contributions in nuclear matter , but it is insufficient to accurately reproduce nuclear sizes .",
    "it is likely that the density dependence of the two @xmath77 terms is too similar to provide enough flexibility for a good fit .",
    "thus we find that we need at least @xmath126 terms to find a good fit to nuclear properties .",
    "examples are sets q1 and q2 .",
    "once we allow all @xmath126 terms , however , the fit is underdetermined , as is evident by the differences between our sets g1 and g2 .",
    "one of the important new features are the @xmath219 and @xmath220 parameters , which accompany derivative corrections . without these",
    "included in the fit , set g2 can not achieve a @xmath300 better than 100 .    if we include @xmath221 parameters from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fifth ] ) in the fit , only small improvements in @xmath300 ( @xmath363 units ) are found .",
    "the net contribution to the energy from these terms is very small ( roughly a few tenths of an mev ) in these fits , even if the coefficients are artificially made large so that individual contributions are significant .",
    "furthermore , the changes in the lower - order coefficients from the @xmath126 fits are small .",
    "thus we find @xmath126 contributions are necessary and sufficient for this set of observables .",
    "clearly the @xmath221 results , when included , do not drive the physics , and their effects can be absorbed into small changes in the lower - order couplings . the insensitivity to the @xmath221 terms validates our truncation of the lagrangian .",
    "the parameters in table  [ tab : one ] have been displayed in such a way that they should all be of order unity according to nda and the naturalness assumption .",
    "this is seen to be the case . from set g1 .",
    "its contribution to the energy is still compatible with natural estimates despite its size because of the @xmath364 counting factor .",
    "] it is important to emphasize this nontrivial result : without the guidance from nda , these coefficients could be any size at all !",
    "we conclude that nda and the naturalness assumption are indeed compatible with and implied by the observed properties of finite nuclei , even though we are absorbing many - body effects in the coefficients .    however , the detailed mechanism by which the nuclear observables constrain the parameters to be natural is not transparent .",
    "second - order ( @xmath312 ) coefficients vary only slightly , regardless of the number of parameters used .",
    "the other parameters , while natural , are not as well determined .",
    "we searched for unnatural parameter sets by starting from unnatural values , but the optimization always produced natural results .",
    "the @xmath221 parameters can be made large , but they are tuned by the optimization so that they cancel almost completely in the hartree equations . despite the narrow range of densities present in ordinary nuclei , the different density dependence of various terms in the energy is apparently sufficient to enforce naturalness .",
    "our goals in this paper are to construct an effective field theory based on hadrons that is appropriate for calculations of finite - density nuclear systems and to propose methods for making these calculations tractable .",
    "the lagrangian is consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd , and heavy , non - goldstone bosons are introduced to avoid the calculation of ( some ) virtual pion loops . to organize the lagrangian",
    ", we rely on naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) , which allows us to extract the dimensional scales of any term , on the assumption of naturalness , which says that the remaining dimensionless coefficient for each term should be of order unity , and on the observation that the ratios of mean meson fields ( and their gradients ) to the nucleon mass ( which generically represents the `` heavy '' mass scale ) are good expansion parameters .",
    "since the meson fields are roughly proportional to the nuclear density , and since the spatial variations in nuclei are determined by the momentum distributions of the valence nucleon wave functions , this organizational scheme is essentially an expansion in @xmath365 , where @xmath245 is a fermi wavenumber corresponding to normal nuclear densities . if nda and the naturalness assumption are valid , one can expand the lagrangian in powers of the fields and their derivatives , truncate at some finite order , and thus have some predictive power for the properties of nuclei .",
    "our fits to bulk and single - particle nuclear properties show that this is indeed the case .    as in all effective field theories ,",
    "the coefficients in our nonrenormalizable lagrangian implicitly include contributions from energy scales heavier than our generic mass @xmath168 .",
    "thus contributions from baryon vacuum loops and non - goldstone boson loops ( including , in principle , particles more massive than those considered here ) are parametrized in this way .",
    "moreover , since we presently compute the nuclear observables at the one - baryon - loop or hartree level , fitting the parameters to nuclei means that they also implicitly include the effects of many - body corrections .",
    "these consist of nucleon exchange and correlation contributions , which may involve virtual states with large excitation energies , modifications of the vacuum dynamics at finite density , like the nuclear lamb shift , and virtual pion loops , since the mean pion field vanishes in spherical nuclei .",
    "these many - body effects involve both short- and long - range dynamics , so it is notable that our fitted parameters are still natural",
    ".    we can understand this result with the following arguments .",
    "first , it is unlikely that natural parameters arise from a sensitive cancellation between unnatural parameters in the lagrangian and compensating large many - body effects .",
    "it is much more likely that the parameters in the lagrangian are natural , and the modifications from many - body effects are small .",
    "this is consistent with explicit calculations of relativistic exchange and correlation effects , which show that these contributions do not significantly modify the nucleon self - energies nor introduce large state dependence , at least for states in the fermi sea .",
    "this `` hartree dominance '' of the mean fields @xcite and of the parameters needed to produce them is a crucial element in the expansion and truncation scheme described above .",
    "an important topic for future work is the explicit evaluation of correlation effects in this model , both to disentangle these contributions from the fit parameters and to verify the extent to which hartree dominance is valid",
    ".    we can also understand why earlier relativistic hartree approaches to nuclear structure were successful .",
    "many of these calculations used lagrangians that were truncated arbitrarily at quartic interactions in the meson fields , but we have seen that quintic and higher - order terms are unimportant ( and undetermined ) for the nuclear observables of interest .",
    "moreover , even though most of these investigations arbitrarily set some of the cubic and quartic meson parameters to zero , we have also seen that the full complement of parameters through fourth order ( @xmath61 ) are underdetermined by the data .",
    "therefore , keeping only a subset of the parameters does not preclude the possibility of a realistic fit to nuclei .    in summary",
    ", we have constructed an effective lagrangian that maintains the symmetries of qcd , such as lorentz invariance , parity conservation , chiral symmetry , and electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "the bulk and single - particle properties of nuclei can be described realistically by this effective hadronic theory at the one - baryon - loop level .",
    "naive dimensional analysis and the naturalness assumption are found to be compatible with the observed nuclear properties .",
    "the fitted parameters are natural , and the results are not driven by the last terms kept .",
    "the description of the spin - orbit splittings of the least bound nucleons and the shell structure are generally good , although the errors are relatively large compared with the other observables .",
    "the long - range electromagnetic structure of the nucleon is included explicitly using vector - meson dominance and derivative couplings to the photon ; it is not necessary to introduce _ ad hoc _ electromagnetic form factors . the mesonic and gradient contributions are important for reducing fluctuations in the point - nucleon charge density , and the resulting nuclear charge form factors agree well with experiment .",
    "the extension of these calculations beyond one - baryon - loop order is currently in progress .",

    "<S> an effective hadronic lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics and intended for applications to finite - density systems is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the degrees of freedom are ( valence ) nucleons , pions , and the low - lying non - goldstone bosons , which account for the intermediate - range nucleon  nucleon interactions and conveniently describe the nonvanishing expectation values of nucleon bilinears . </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry is realized nonlinearly , with a light scalar meson included as a chiral singlet to describe the mid - range nucleon  </S>",
    "<S> nucleon attraction . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy electromagnetic structure of the nucleon is described within the theory using vector - meson dominance , so that external form factors are not needed . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian is expanded in powers of the fields and their derivatives , with the terms organized using georgi s `` naive dimensional analysis '' . </S>",
    "<S> results are presented for finite nuclei and nuclear matter at one - baryon - loop order , using the single - nucleon structure determined within the model . </S>",
    "<S> parameters obtained from fits to nuclear properties show that naive dimensional analysis is a useful principle and that a truncation of the effective lagrangian at the first few powers of the fields and their derivatives is justified . </S>"
