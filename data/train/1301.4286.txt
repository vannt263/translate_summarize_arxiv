    "in a recent paper  @xcite we studied the behaviour of gravitational perturbations on minkowski space near space - like infinity . for this purpose we used the spin-2 zero - rest - mass equation which governs the perturbations of the weyl curvature .",
    "the system was studied using a conformal gauge given by friedrich  @xcite which represents space - like infinity as a cylinder connecting past and future null - infinity .",
    "this gauge exhibits explicitly the main issues of the propagation of gravitational waves in asymptotically flat space - times , namely the question of how @xmath0 is related to @xmath1 , or , in other words , how the late ingoing gravitational radiation affects the early outgoing radiation .    in",
    "@xcite it was shown how the field propagates near the cylinder .",
    "it turns out that the cylinder is a total characteristic in the sense that the equations turn into intrinsic equations on it , there appear no outward derivatives .",
    "hence , the field on the cylinder is entirely determined by initial data on a space - like initial hyper - surface and there are no free data to be prescribed on the cylinder .    the crucial property , however , is the fact that the intrinsic equations degenerate on the intersections @xmath2 between the cylinder and null - infinity @xmath3 . here , the field may develop singularities which can propagate onto null - infinity destroying its smoothness .",
    "friedrich has conjectured that certain conditions on the initial data have to be satisfied in order for the field to be smooth on @xmath4 .",
    "these analytical properties have been explored numerically in  @xcite based on the first order system for the spin-2 field .",
    "the behavior of the resulting numerical solutions near the cylinder @xmath5 was studied .",
    "the performance of the code near the ill - behaved location @xmath6 at the junction of the cylinder and null - infinity was tested using different initial data .",
    "the analytical results were reproduced quite successfully .",
    "in particular , the analytically predicted singular behaviour could be reproduced numerically .",
    "the results in @xcite strongly indicate that appropriate classes of initial data can be successfully evolved without loss of convergence up and including the region @xmath6 , but not beyond . as expected , since the equations are no longer hyperbolic beyond @xmath6 the code develops numerical instabilities and crashes .    with the present article",
    "we want to follow up on this work using an equivalent system of second order wave equations .",
    "our main motivation for this is the claim by several numerical analysts ( see e.g. , kreiss and ortiz  @xcite ) that the numerical solutions of second order wave equations have better properties than those for the corresponding first order systems .",
    "specifically , according to @xcite , numerical approximations based on second order equations lead to better accuracy than the ones based on first order equations .",
    "in addition , in the second order case , spurious high - frequency waves travelling against the characteristics disappear .",

[ sec : numerical_analysis ] our numerical implementation and results are presented . finally , we conclude with a discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : disscusion ] .",
    "the conventions used in this work are those of  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will briefly summarize the finite representation of minkowski space - time close to space - like infinity originally proposed by friedrich in @xcite ; more detailed discussions of this topic can be found in @xcite .",
    "the physical metric of minkowski space - time in cartesian coordinates  @xmath7 reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 . in this representation the region that we are mainly interested in , namely the neighborhood of space - like infinity @xmath10 , lies far away from the origin . in order to get a more detailed description of the points lying at infinity",
    ", we consider the coordinate inversion @xcite : @xmath11 which brings our original metric into the form @xmath12 notice that with the aforementioned inversion points close to infinity in our original coordinates @xmath13 are now lying in the vicinity of the origin of the new ` inverted ' coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "but this comes at a price : the above metric is singular at the null - cone of the origin @xmath15 . introducing the conformal factor @xmath16",
    "one can define the conformally equivalent metric @xmath17 which extends smoothly to the null - cone @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that space - like infinity is a regular point in minkowski space - time .",
    "it is well - known that in space - times with non - vanishing adm - mass this is no longer the case and space - like infinity can no longer be represented as a point . instead , as discussed in detail in  @xcite it is more appropriate to represent the region near the origin as a cylinder",
    "this is achieved here by a further rescaling of the metric @xmath19 with a function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radial spatial distance from the origin and @xmath22 is a positive radial function with @xmath23 .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath24 represents the remaining conformal gauge freedom .",
    "after the introduction of a new time - coordinate @xmath25 by defining @xmath26 the metric @xmath27 expressed in polar coordinates takes the following spherically symmetric form @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the usual angular coordinates and @xmath30 denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath31 .",
    "notice that the final rescaled metric and the original minkowski @xmath32 are related by the conformal factor @xmath33 which is positive on @xmath34 , corresponding to the minkowski space - time .",
    "the conformal factor vanishes on the two regular 3-dimensional hyper - surfaces @xmath35 the hyper - surfaces @xmath36 are null , corresponding to null - infinity , while @xmath5 is a regular hyper - surface with the topology of a cylinder .",
    "interestingly , in the limit @xmath37 future and past null - infinity do not meet at the same point as in the conventional picture .",
    "instead , they meet the cylinder @xmath5 in the 2-spheres @xmath38 .",
    "this observation leads naturally to the finite representation of space - like infinity , where @xmath10 has been blown up to the cylinder @xmath39 .",
    "the function @xmath24 dictates the shape of these structures . here , the two simplest choices will be considered : @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the former ` horizontal ' representation ,",
    "null - infinity is given by the set @xmath42 , while in the latter ` diagonal ' representation by the set @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] .",
    "the main advantage of working in the horizontal representation is that the entire space - time is contained between @xmath44 , which allows us to study the whole space - time in a ( formally ) finite time evolution , i.e. reaching @xmath45 .",
    "but , on the numerical level , working in this representation is more challenging , especially close to the region @xmath6 where the characteristic speed becomes infinite , see figs .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] and [ fig : charact_spin-2_wave ] .",
    "thus , the study of our system close to @xmath6 demands more computational resources and/or more elaborated time integration techniques  e.g . in @xcite",
    "we used an adaptive time step runge - kutta scheme to get as close as possible to @xmath45 . for a further discussion on these and related issues",
    "see @xcite .     for the horizontal and the diagonal conformal representations . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it is helpful to introduce the double null coordinates @xmath46 which puts the metric into the form @xmath47 now , @xmath3 is characterized by the vanishing of exactly one of the null coordinates , the other one being non - zero . both coordinates vanish on the cylinder  @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] we also display the lines of constant @xmath48 and @xmath49 . since these are coordinates adapted to the conformal structure of @xmath50 we can see clearly , that the cylinder is ` invisible ' from the point of view of the conformal structure .",
    "notice , that the differentiable structures defined by the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 coordinates are completely different near the boundary  @xmath53 .",
    "our objectives in the present section are to derive a second order system for the spin-2 equation described in  @xcite and to establish a correspondence between the two formulations",
    ".      our starting point will be the spin-2 zero - rest - mass equation @xcite on an arbitrary space - time @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a totally symmetric spinor - field on the space - time .",
    "now , we will derive a system of wave equations for @xmath55 ( see eqn .  ) and show its equivalence with  . establishing this correspondence",
    "is necessary because we need to know under what conditions we obtain the same solutions",
    ". we will then also be able to compare the numerical behavior of the two systems and study their similarities and differences . in the following",
    ", we will prove that in a conformally flat space - time with vanishing ricci scalar a solution @xmath55 of the spin-2 wave equation , which satisfies initially the spin-2 zero - rest - mass equation , is also a solution of the latter . in the case of an initial - boundary value problem ( as we deal with in our numerical studies ) the same statement is true provided the boundary conditions for the wave system are determined from the first order system .",
    "first , we define the spinor @xmath56 then the equation @xmath57 is nothing else than the spin-2 equation . taking another spinor derivative , we obtain an equation for the derivative of @xmath58 @xmath59 now , assume that @xmath55 satisfies  , then @xmath60 and @xmath61 contracting over indices @xmath62 and @xmath63 yields @xmath64 a purely algebraic condition between the conformal curvature and the spinor field . this is a buchdahl condition  @xcite which implies the well - known fact that the zero - rest mass equation ( with spin 2 in this case ) is inconsistent on space - times with non - vanishing weyl tensor .",
    "so we take @xmath65 from now on and we also assume that @xmath66",
    ". then the spinor field satisfies the second order wave equation @xmath67 conversely , let @xmath55 be a solution of  .",
    "then   shows that the spinor field @xmath57 satisfies the equation @xmath68 in order to study the properties of this system of pde we look at its symbol .",
    "this is , for every real co - vector @xmath69 , defined as a map @xmath70 between the appropriate spin spaces defined by @xmath71 therefore , it is enough to discuss only the map @xmath72 we define a sesqui - linear form on @xmath73 by @xmath74 it is easy to verify that @xmath75 is hermitian due to the reality of @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath76 furthermore , @xmath77 is positive definite , if and only if @xmath69 is a time - like and future - pointing covector .",
    "since the map @xmath78 simply consists of four copies of the map @xmath79 this result shows that the full system   is symmetric hyperbolic and that , consequently , its cauchy problem is well - posed .",
    "thus , if @xmath60 on an initial hyper - surface and , for initial boundary value problems , if boundary data are given such that the ingoing @xmath58 waves vanish , then the field @xmath58 vanishes everywhere , i.e. , the field @xmath55 satisfies .",
    "this conclusion holds on the region where the systems are hyperbolic . in our application below we will consider situations where hyperbolicity is lost on a region with codimension 2 , namely the spheres @xmath2 .",
    "we find empirically that the conclusion still holds near these regions .",
    "we will use this result as follows . in the numerical implementation of the initial data and the boundary conditions",
    "are determined from .",
    "then , the computed solution will be compared to a previously computed @xcite solution of .      in order to obtain a coordinate representation of",
    ", we introduce a null - tetrad that is adapted to the spherical symmetry of the background metric  .",
    "we will choose the same null tetrad @xmath80 as in  @xcite , namely @xmath81 the non - vanishing spin - coefficients for this tetrad are @xmath82 now we express the wave operator @xmath83 in terms of the weighted differential operators of the ghp ( geroch - held - penrose ) formalism @xcite using the commutation relations @xmath84 which contain only the non - vanishing spin - coefficients . expanding the totally symmetric spin-2 zero - rest - mass field in the familiar way",
    "@xmath85 we obtain the following system of five equations @xmath86 with @xmath87 .    expressing the ghp operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 in terms of the directional derivatives along the tetrad vectors @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see  @xcite ) yields @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a @xmath94-scalar quantity with boost - weight @xmath95 and spin - weight @xmath96 , see  @xcite . due to the spherical symmetry of the metric and the adapted null - tetrad",
    "it is natural to refer the @xmath97 and @xmath98 operators to the unit - sphere , so that we replace @xmath99 in   as in @xcite .",

    "the notation @xmath115 was introduced .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that this form of the system holds for @xmath116 , since for @xmath117 the components @xmath118 and @xmath119 vanish and for @xmath120 only @xmath121 survives .",
    "since the above system comes from equations involving the wave operator it is hyperbolic .",
    "because of its hyperbolic nature the system has two families of real characteristic curves . as in the case of the spin-2 equation",
    ", their behavior will be very useful in the subsequent numerical studies .",
    "following @xcite , the slope of the characteristic curves for the system is given by @xmath122    the characteristic curves of the spin-2 wave equation are identical to those of the spin-2 equation . fig .",
    "[ fig : charact_spin-2_wave ] shows the ` outgoing ' characteristic curves of with slope @xmath123 near a neighborhood of @xmath6 ; near @xmath124 these curves tend to become parallel to the cylinder @xmath5 . on the other hand",

    "[ fig : charact_spin-2_wave ] along the @xmath31-axis .",
    "there is a slight difference with the first order case , though .",
    "now , the behavior of the characteristic curves is universal , in the sense that all the components of the spin-2 field propagate along the same characteristics , while in the first order system different components have in general different characteristics ( depending on the gauge ) .",
    "furthermore , as in the first order system the evolution equation reduce to an interior system on the cylinder in the sense that there remain no @xmath31-derivative terms in the equations when evaluated at @xmath53 .",
    "so , as before , the cylinder is a total characteristic for the system . and",
    "as before , the equations loose their hyperbolicity at @xmath2 , since the coefficient in front of the second time derivative vanishes there .",
    "in this section , we will numerically solve the initial boundary value problem for the spin-2 wave equation using the findings of sec .",
    "[ sec : relating_first_second_order_system ] .",
    "specifically , we will prescribe initial data that satisfy the constraints of the first order system and subsequently evolve them with . in addition , the boundary conditions will be prescribed using the first order system .",
    "we discretize the @xmath126 system using the method of lines .",
    "accordingly , the system is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations by discretizing the spatial coordinate @xmath31 . in this work",
    ", we use finite difference techniques to achieve that .    as computational domain",
    "we adopt the interval @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "a finite representation of @xmath128 is obtained through the introduction of an equidistant grid @xmath129 with @xmath130 on @xmath128 , where @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is the grid spacing .",
    "the spatial derivative operators appearing in are approximated by appropriate _ summation by parts _ ( sbp ) finite difference operators @xcite .",
    "the sbp operators arise from discrete versions of the continuous energy estimates that were originally introduced in  @xcite . while these energy estimates guarantee the well - posedness in the continuous case , on the discrete level their discrete counterparts guarantee the numerical stability of our discrete schemes .",
    "this is the main reason we chose to use these specific finite difference operators .",
    "another very appealing property of the sbp operators is that although their accuracy near the boundaries is , depending on the details of their construction , one or two orders smaller than the one in the interior of the grid , the overall accuracy is of the same order with the accuracy in the interior .",
    "we approximate the second order derivatives with the minimal width , full norm sbp operator given in @xcite , which is fourth order accurate in the interior and second order at the boundary .",
    "we call an sbp operator with these properties a @xmath133-operator .",
    "the first order derivatives are approximated by the corresponding first order sbp operator with the same norm matrix originally constructed in @xcite , which is a @xmath134-operator .",
    "the results presented below were obtained with the above choice of sbp operators .",
    "we also experimented with sbp operators based on a diagonal norm ; specifically , the second derivatives were approximated by a minimal width , diagonal norm @xmath133-operator and the first derivatives by a @xmath133-operator with the same norm , both given in @xcite .",
    "this combination of operators is expected ( see @xcite ) to have a third order overall accuracy .",
    "our numerical findings , see @xcite , confirmed this expectation .",
    "in addition , we combined the above full norm second order sbp operator with two first order sbp operators with different norm constructed in @xcite , which were very successfully used already in the numerical implementation of the first - order formulation of the spin-2 equation , see @xcite .",
    "namely , the first order derivatives were approximated with restricted full norm @xmath134-operators .",
    "of course , with this choice we violate the assumption made in  @xcite , of combining first and second order sbp operators of the same norm . theoretically though , under certain conditions on the norm matrices of the two operators , energy estimates can still be obtained .",
    "so , according to our numerical findings @xcite , it seems that requiring the same norm for first and second order operators is sufficient but not necessary for stability .",
    "a point that also needs special attention is the imposition of the boundary conditions",
    ". a wrong imposition of the boundary condition would destroy the designed accuracy of the sbp operators and lead to instabilities @xcite .",
    "we use a very simple , but highly efficient , _ penalty _ method  the so - called _ simultaneous approximation term _ ( sat ) method introduced in @xcite  that preserves the designed accuracy of the sbp operators and guarantees the numerical stability of our schemes .",
    "the combination of the sbp operators with the sat method has been successfully applied in several different circumstances , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "finally , one has to decide how to solve the semi - discrete system of odes obtained from after the spatial discretization . here , we implement the system as a first - order system of odes by introducing the first order time derivatives of the grid functions as additional variables .",
    "this system is then solved using the standard 4th order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "the code was written from scratch in python .      as it was already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : characteristics ] , the cylinder is a total characteristic of the system .",
    "thus , we do not have to prescribe boundary conditions for the points of our computational domain that lie on the cylinder , i.e. at @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , at the boundary @xmath135 there is one ingoing characteristic for each component of the spin-2 field .",
    "thus , we have to provide appropriate boundary conditions at @xmath135 for each component @xmath102 .",
    "but , in order to compute the same solution as with the first order system we need to use all the available information from the first - order system to determine boundary conditions for the second order system . essentially , we require the first order system to hold not only on the initial surface but also on the boundaries . then , there remains just one free function , namely @xmath136 , which can be specified arbitrarily on the boundary @xmath135 .",
    "( for a further analysis on this issue see [ sec : general_data ] . ) to implement the boundary conditions we can use different formulations of boundary conditions which are known to lead to well - posed problems for the wave equation : neumann or , more generally , robin conditions of the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 , as well as sommerfeld type boundary conditions . since we need to use informations from the 1st order formulation of the spin-2 equation ( as discussed in sec .",

    "we can conclude that we get the same qualitative behaviour of the numerical solutions .",
    "in particular , we have shown explicitly that solutions of the second - order system converge to a solution of the first - order system with the same initial and boundary data .",
    "the solutions can be evolved stably up to and including @xmath6 in the diagonal case but not beyond .",
    "any attempt to evolve beyond @xmath6 with the same algorithm end in numerical instability .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we showed that in the first order formulation of the spin-2 zero - rest - mass equation developed in @xcite it is possible to evolve asymptotically euclidean initial data beyond @xmath6 and extract the physically important radiation fields on @xmath0 .    concerning the comparison of the two approaches we confirm the claims in  @xcite : with the same number of grid points we obtain better accuracy roughly by a factor 4 with the second - order system and we do not see any spurious high - frequency waves in the second - order system .    in the present work we carried out numerical simulations using ( first and second order ) sbp operators of the same ( full or diagonal ) norm",
    "our results agree with their designed accuracy as described in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in order to explore the potentialities of the available sbp operators , we went one step further and combined first and second order discrete sbp operators with respect to _ different _ inner products .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the requirement of using sbp operators with the same norm does not seem to be necessary : the second order full norm operator seems to perform quite well even when combined with first order sbp operators based on a restricted full norm .",
