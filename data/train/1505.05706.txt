    "in digital holography , a camera records the interference pattern of the object field wavefront with a known coherent reference beam . this digital hologram",
    "is then used to reconstruct numerically the image of the object by back propagating the measured object field wavefront from the hologram to the object @xcite .",
    "many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the holographic image in free space @xcite , like single fourier transform method @xcite , plane wave expansion method with two fourier transforms @xcite , or adjustable magnification method @xcite .",
    "although digital holographic microscopy is extensively used @xcite , very few papers describe the reconstruction procedure that must be used in holographic microscopy .",

    "@xcite proposed a holographic microscopy reconstruction algorithm , in which the field is propagated in free space from the camera to the image of the object ( conjugate of the object by the microscope objective mo ) @xcite .",
    "various methods can be used then to compensate for the phase curvature of the lens , and for the tilt angle of off - axis holography .",
    "ferraro et al .",
    "@xcite use a reference hologram as phase mask .",
    "montfort et al . , and colomb et al .",
    "@xcite use a calculated phase mask that is defined by its zernike polynomial expansion , where coefficients are adjusted to optimize the contrast of the image .",
    "residual phase distortions can be then compensated by using a zernike phase mask located in the plane of the object . in most cases ,",
    "these methods have been used to measure the phase of `` flat objects '' , e.g. a biologic sample between slide and cover slide or a micro lens device @xcite .",
    "these methods are well adapted to such cases , owing to these great efforts to compensate phase distortions and get a precise phase reference .     and",
    "@xmath5 : signal and reference fields ; note that bs2 is angularly tilted in order to perform off axis holography .",
    ", width=317 ]    to illustrate reconstruction , let us consider a typical holographic microscopy setup ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_simple__setup ] ) .",
    "the object is located in plane o and is imaged by the microscope objective mo in plane o. the camera located in plane c records the hologram @xmath6 that is the interference pattern of the signal field @xmath7 with the reference field @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose is to reconstruct the amplitude and the phase of the field scattered by the object in the object plane o , and near this plane ( if the object is thick or if one want to measure the wave field ) . before making reconstruction , one need to calibrate the setup to get the reconstruction parameters , which depends on the optical elements in the image half space : location of mo , bs2 and camera , bs2 angular tilt and direction and curvature of the reference beam ( i.e. location of point r ) .",
    "once the calibration of the setup is made , the reconstruction must be valid for any object .",
    "this means that one can modify all the optical elements in the object half space ( object and object location , direction and curvature of the illumination beam ) , but the optical elements in the image half space must remains unchanged .",
    "the reconstruction methods mentioned above @xcite made reconstruction in the image half space .",
    "this means that the image of the object in plane o is reconstructed by propagating the hologram over a distance @xmath8 from c to o. this propagation is calculated in free space , by using either the one fourier transform ( 1-fft ) method @xcite , or the angular spectrum ( 2-fft ) method @xcite .",
    "however , reconstruction in the image half space becomes difficult when varying the location of the object along @xmath9 , or when imaging thick objects .",
    "indeed , the location of the image o and the reconstruction distance @xmath10 strongly depend on the object location @xmath11 , which complexifies the reconstruction process .",
    "if the object is located near plane c , which is imaged by mo on the camera ( i.e. on plane c ) , we get @xmath12 0 .",
    "the 2-fft reconstruction method , which is well suited to small @xmath13 , should thus be preferred .",
    "conversely , if the object is close to the mo focal plane , we get @xmath14 , and the 1-fft method should be used .",
    "this point tends to be problematic if we consider reconstruction of both amplitude and phase of of the light scattered by a thick 3d sample , or if one want to measure the wave field . as a matter of fact ,",
    "it prevents experimental setup calibration to remain valid for the entire sample thickness .",
    "making the setup calibration independent of the sample position according to mo is therefore an issue to tackle .    here , we propose to consider that the recorded signal @xmath15 represents the hologram @xmath16 of the field scattered by the object in the plane of the image of the camera ( i.e. in plane c ) .",
    "the reconstruction is therefore made in the object half space , by propagating hologram @xmath16 over a distance @xmath17 from plane c to plane o. since @xmath18 is always small ( a few microns ) , the 2-fft method@xcite is well adapted in all cases ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , which notably simplifies reconstruction algorithms .",
    "moreover , if the calibration is done well , this reconstruction can be made with orthogonal @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath9 axes , while keeping constant the pixel pitches in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 axes .",
    "the hologram @xmath6 recorded by the camera in plane c is : @xmath25 where @xmath7 and @xmath5 are the signal and reference fields in plane c. because of the microscope objective mo , the curvature of the reference field and the off axis angular tilt , the phase of @xmath6 in plane c is not equal to the phase of the signal field in camera conjugate plane c , from which the object half space reconstruction will be made .",
    "moreover , the + 1 grating order term @xmath26 that is proportional to the field @xmath7 must be selectively filtered . to perform the reconstruction from the field @xmath7 in plane c",
    ", it is thus necessary to manipulate the data to compensate for these phase effects and to select the @xmath26 term that is proportional to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this manipulation of the data must be made with few calibration parameters that characterize the optical elements of the image half space part of the setup , and that do not depends on the the object i.e. on the optical elements of the object half space .",
    "let us analyze first the phase curvature of @xmath26 in plane c. for that purpose , we will consider a  gedanken experiment \" without object in which the illumination beam is plane wave beam oriented along the optical axis @xmath27 .",
    "the field @xmath7 is thus flat in plane c. this plane wave is focused by mo at point p in the mo pupil plane .",
    "the signal complex field @xmath7 exhibit thus a phase factor equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the modulus of the wavevector in air , and where @xmath30 is the radius of curvature of the wavefront that is equal to the mo pupil to camera distance @xmath31 .",

    "<S> we propose an holographic microscopy reconstruction method , which propagates the hologram , in the object half space , in the vicinity of the object . </S>",
    "<S> the calibration yields reconstructions with an undistorted reconstruction grid i.e. with orthogonal @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 axis and constant pixels pitch . </S>",
    "<S> the method is validated with an usaf target imaged by a @xmath360 microscope objective , whose holograms are recorded and reconstructed for different usaf locations along the longitudinal axis : -75 to + 75 @xmath4 m . since the reconstruction numerical phase mask , the reference phase curvature and mo form an afocal device , the reconstruction can be interpreted as occurring equivalently in the object or in image half space . </S>"
