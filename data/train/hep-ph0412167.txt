    "electroweak gauge bosons have played , and will likely play , an important role as experimentally distinctive probes of new physics .",
    "both qcd and mixed electroweak - qcd processes contribute important backgrounds to various new - physics signals .",
    "the computation of amplitudes for such processes is thus an important part of a physics program at modern - day colliders .    at tree - level ,",
    "an elegant  and computationally - efficient  approach was found a decade and a half ago by berends and giele  @xcite .",
    "other related approaches have also been employed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , various computer - driven approaches such as madgraph  @xcite , are widely used .",
    "these approaches are not the end of the story , however . for qcd and other massless gauge theories , cachazo , svrek and witten ( csw )",
    "@xcite have presented a powerful set of new computational rules for scattering amplitudes .",
    "these rules emerged from analyses inspired by witten s",
    "@xcite proposal of a weak  weak coupling duality between @xmath3 supersymmetric gauge theory and the topological open - string @xmath4 model with a twistor target space .",
    "this proposal generalizes nair s earlier description  @xcite of the simplest gauge - theory amplitudes .",
    "( berkovits and motl  @xcite , neitzke and vafa  @xcite , and siegel  @xcite have given alternative descriptions of such a possible topological dual to the @xmath3 theory . )",
    "the csw rules are of interest in their own right for tree - level computations .",
    "their efficiency can be improved when recast in a recursive form  @xcite ( dual in a sense to ` connected ' twistor space prescriptions  @xcite ) .",
    "they also show great promise for simplifying loop calculations  @xcite .",
    "( a direct topological - string approach appears to be problematic because of the appearance of non - unitary states from conformal supergravity  @xcite . )",
    "our purpose here is to extend the csw construction to include building blocks for mixed qcd - electroweak amplitudes .",
    "witten s weak  weak duality is a very promising step towards understanding why amplitudes in unbroken gauge theories are so much simpler than expected from the feynman diagram expansion .",
    "the best - known example of simplicity in amplitudes is given by the parke ",
    "taylor amplitudes  @xcite of massless gauge theories ( including , of course , qcd ) .",
    "these are an infinite series of amplitudes , with two negative - helicity gluons and an arbitrary number of positive - helicity ones ( or their parity conjugates ) .",
    "they are usually called ` maximally helicity - violating ' ( mhv ) amplitudes .",
    "they play an important role in the csw construction , as the vertices are a particular off - shell continuation of the mhv amplitudes . although no - one has as yet given a direct derivation of the csw diagrams from a lagrangian there is little doubt they are correct , because they exhibit the correct kinematic poles and maintain lorentz invariance , although it is not manifest  @xcite .",
    "the rules extend to any massless gauge theory  @xcite , and lead to explicit results for next - to - mhv amplitudes  @xcite , and have undergone non - trivial checks using ` googly ' amplitudes ( the parity conjugates of the mhv amplitudes ) in the context of string and field theory  @xcite .",
    "the csw rules or their recursive reformulation can be implemented either analytically or numerically .",
    "the twistor - motivated constructions to date have largely left unaddressed the question of how to compute processes which contain both colored and uncolored particles .",
    "of particular importance to collider experiments are of course the computation of amplitudes with both qcd and electroweak particles .",
    "dixon , glover , and khoze  @xcite took the first step in this direction , in showing how to compute amplitudes containing a higgs boson coupled to qcd via a massive top - quark loop ( in the infinite - mass limit ) .",
    "our purpose here is to incorporate another important class of processes , those containing electroweak vector bosons .",
    "we will do so by providing a csw - like construction of vector currents , which may in principle be coupled to an _ arbitrary _ source .",
    "typically , one is interested in processes where produced vector bosons decay into lepton pairs . for this purpose",
    ", one would couple the currents to lepton pairs .",
    "however , one can also couple them to more complicated electroweak objects , including , for example , non - abelian currents decaying in turn into combinations of higgs bosons and multiple lepton pairs .",
    "these applications go beyond the csw construction , and are a step in the direction of constructing an off - shell effective action @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we will focus on the case of coupling a process involving one quark pair and any number of gluons to one colorless off - shell vector boson .",
    "the constructions should generalize , however , to processes with multiple quark pairs , and presumably to those with any number of electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "indeed , as we shall discuss , the generalization to symmetrized electroweak gauge bosons ( @xmath6 ) is straightforward .",
    "it should also be possible to construct similar currents for _ colored _ vector bosons , but we will defer a discussion of these issues to future papers . the key idea in the construction",
    "is to introduce a new set of basic vertices coupling to the off - shell vector boson , analogous to the mhv vertices of csw .",
    "these basic vertices have either one or no negative - helicity gluons .",
    "the rules for combining them into new currents with additional negative - helicity legs are then in fact the same as those of csw .",
    "while we will not provide a first - principles proof of our construction of the vector boson currents , we shall display considerable evidence that it is correct .",
    "it exhibits the correct factorization properties on kinematic poles .",
    "it agrees with previously - computed amplitudes .",
    "in particular , in appendix c of ref .",
    "@xcite vector boson currents for @xmath7 gluons up to @xmath2 are given and we find complete agreement .",
    "we have also implemented a light - cone gauge version of the berends - giele recursion relations  @xcite and have compared our new construction numerically with currents computed thereby up to six gluons of any helicity and eight gluons with selected helicities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in , we review color decompositions , especially for the case of vector boson exchange .",
    "in , we review helicity and mhv vertices . in , we generalize mhv vertices to vertices for currents .",
    "the properties of the amplitudes , including various consistency checks are discussed in .",
    "finally , in , we give our conclusions and outlook .",
    "it is convenient to write the full momentum - space amplitudes using color decompositions  @xcite .",
    "for example , the tree - level @xmath0-gluon amplitude @xmath8 has the color decomposition , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the group of non - cyclic permutations on @xmath0 symbols , and @xmath11 denotes the @xmath11-th gluon and its associated momentum .",
    "for now we are suppressing the helicity labels .",
    "we use the color normalization @xmath12 .",
    "similar decompositions hold for cases involving quarks . in general",
    ", it is more convenient to calculate the partial amplitudes than the entire amplitude at once .    the cases in which we are interested here involve colorless vector bosons .",
    "though it may seem surprising at first sight , single massive vector boson exchange is easily obtained from pure qcd amplitudes ( which are directly calculable from csw diagrams ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 gluons , where @xmath14 represents an off - shell photon , the amplitude reduces to @xmath15 where we use an all outgoing momentum convention .",
    "the particle labels @xmath16 signify quarks , anti - quarks , electrons and positrons , while legs without labels signify gluons .",
    "the off - shell photon , is internal to the amplitude and exchanged between the lepton pair and the quark pair .",
    "one may then convert the exchanged photon to an electroweak vector boson very simply by adjusting the coupling and modifying the photon kinematic pole to be the appropriate one for an unstable massive particle ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath17 one simply modifies the coefficient in to , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass and width of the @xmath23 boson . with the replacement  ( [ photontoboson ] ) , both @xmath23 boson and photon exchange are accounted for in .",
    "the left- and right - handed couplings of fermions to the @xmath23 boson are @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the two signs in @xmath26 correspond to up @xmath27 and down @xmath28 type quarks .",
    "the subscripts @xmath29 and @xmath30 refer to whether the particle to which the @xmath23 couples is left- or right - handed .",
    "that is , @xmath31 is to be used for the configuration where the quark ( leg 3 ) has plus helicity and the anti - quark ( leg @xmath0 ) has minus helicity .",
    "similarly , @xmath32 corresponds to the opposite configuration . for @xmath33 boson exchange ,",
    "the propagator correction is @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mass and width of the @xmath33 boson , and the corresponding couplings are , @xmath37 in the last formula , for quarks @xmath38 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix and @xmath39 is an up type quark and @xmath40 a down type quark . for leptons",
    "it is the identity matrix with @xmath39 an up type lepton and @xmath40 a down type lepton .",
    "more generally , one may convert gluons to photons , purely by group theoretic rearrangements .",
    "( as one example of this , see the fourth appendix of ref  @xcite . ) however , in general , it is not possible to then convert the photonic amplitudes to ones involving electroweak vector bosons since vector bosons have non - abelian self interactions which photons do not .",
    "although it is rather pleasing that the csw formalism applies directly to single massive vector boson exchange , cases involving two or more vector bosons are much richer both from phenomenological and theoretical vantage points .",
    "a purpose of this paper is to construct an appropriate off - shell continuation so that the csw methodology can be applied to such cases as well .",
    "the csw construction  @xcite builds amplitudes out of vertices which are off - shell continuations of the parke  taylor amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes , with two negative - helicity gluons and any number of positive - helicity ones , are the maximally helicity - violating ( mhv ) non - vanishing tree - level amplitudes in a gauge theory . in the spinor helicity",
    "@xcite notation , they are , @xmath41 where the two negative - helicity gluons are labeled @xmath42 . in this equation , @xmath43 .",
    "we follow the standard spinor normalizations @xmath44 and @xmath45 . with our conventions",
    "all particle momenta are taken to be outgoing .",
    "the remaining mhv fermionic amplitudes needed for our discussion of vector boson currents are , @xmath46 the last equation gives the color - ordered amplitude appearing in after relabeling @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these amplitudes may be obtained from the purely gluonic mhv ones using supersymmetry identities  @xcite .    in the csw construction a particular off - shell continuation of these amplitudes",
    "is an mhv vertex .",
    "the original csw prescription for the off - shell continuation of a momentum @xmath49 amounts to replacing @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an arbitrary light - like reference vector , in the parke - taylor formula .",
    "the extra factors introduced in this off - shell continuation cancel when sewing together vertices to obtain an on - shell amplitude . as shown by csw",
    "@xcite , on - shell amplitudes are in fact independent of the choice of @xmath51 , implying that the sum over mhv diagrams is lorentz invariant .",
    "in this paper we use an alternative , but equivalent way of going off - shell  @xcite .",
    "we instead decompose an off - shell momentum @xmath52 into a sum of two massless momenta , where one is proportional to the auxiliary light - cone reference momentum @xmath51 ( with @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 the constraint @xmath55 yields @xmath56 if @xmath52 goes on shell , @xmath57 vanishes .",
    "also , if two off - shell vectors sum to zero , @xmath58 , then so do the corresponding @xmath59s .",
    "the prescription for continuing mhv amplitudes or vertices off shell is to replace , @xmath60 when @xmath49 is taken off shell . in the on - shell limit ,",
    "@xmath61 vanishes and @xmath62 .",
    "although equivalent to the original csw prescription , it is a bit more convenient to implement . in particular , there are no extra factors associated with going off - shell and the mhv vertices carry the same dimensions as amplitudes .",
    "the csw construction replaces ordinary feynman diagrams with diagrams built out of mhv vertices and ordinary propagators .",
    "each vertex has exactly two lines carrying negative helicity ( which may be on or off shell ) , and at least one line carrying positive helicity .",
    "the propagator takes the simple form @xmath63 , because the physical state projector is effectively supplied by the vertices .",
    "we will denote the projected @xmath64 momentum built out of @xmath65 by @xmath66 , for example @xmath67 .",
    "for example , with this notation an all - gluon vertex would be , @xmath68 for the fermionic vertices , there is a subtlety . in the standard phase convention ,",
    "the on - shell amplitudes have the following sort of expression , @xmath69 in the csw approach , the helicity projector in the propagator  @xmath70 in the fermionic case  is supplied by the vertices . in the amplitude ,",
    "each momentum is directed outwards .",
    "when we attempt to link two vertices , we would obtain @xmath71 , for example , from the numerators .",
    "this is not the correct form , because @xmath72 .",
    "up to an overall sign , what we want is @xmath73 .",
    "that is , both vertices must have the same momentum argument in the spinor products . to correct this , we must flip the sign of either the positive- or negative - helicity fermion s momentum in the arguments to the spinor products .",
    "we will choose to flip that of the negative - helicity fermion , so that the vertex reads , @xmath74 where as usual legs are continued off shell by replacing @xmath49 with @xmath75 , and where @xmath76 denotes @xmath77 .",
    "this issue can be ignored in the gluonic vertex because there the corresponding factor would involve @xmath78 .",
    "the csw rules using these vertices will yield fermionic amplitude with a different phase convention than the standard one  @xcite . to obtain the standard phase conventions , we must multiply the on - shell amplitude emerging from the csw rules by a factor of @xmath79 for the negative - helicity fermion leg .",
    "the csw rules then instruct us to write down all tree diagrams with mhv vertices , subject to the constraints that each vertex has exactly two negative - helicity gluons and at least one positive - helicity gluon attached , and that each propagator connects legs of opposite helicity . for amplitudes with two negative - helicity gluons ,",
    "the vertex with all legs taken on shell is then the amplitude . for each additional negative - helicity gluon",
    ", we must add a vertex and a propagator .",
    "the number of vertices is thus the number of negative - helicity gluons , less one .",
    "truein    as a simple example we may use the csw rules to construct next - to - mhv ( nmhv ) partial amplitudes needed for the process @xmath80 . the ` stripped diagrams ' for this process are shown in . by stripped diagrams ,",
    "we mean csw diagrams which have been stripped of all the positive helicity gluons .",
    "dressing the diagrams with the positive helicity gluon legs between @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the color ordering leads to @xmath83 where @xmath84 . renaming @xmath85 gives the partial amplitudes appearing in the vector boson exchange amplitudes ( [ eezpartons ] ) . as discussed above , we must multiply by a factor of @xmath86 to obtain the standard phase conventions .",
    "csw diagrams can be used to obtain any tree - level massless gauge theory amplitude  @xcite .",
    "as the number of negative helicity legs increases , the complexity of the diagrams increases rapidly . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this growth may be tamed using the recursive rearrangement of diagrams in terms of non - mhv vertices .    in general ,",
    "using these amplitudes we may obtain single vector boson exchange amplitudes by making modifications to the couplings , color sums and vector boson propagators of the type discussed in .",
    "however , if we wish to apply the formalism to the phenomenologically interesting cases of vector bosons decaying into higgs bosons or multiple fermion pairs including the non - abelian vector boson self - coupling , an extension of the formalism is required . in the next section",
    "we describe such an extension .",
    "in this section we generalize the csw construction to allow couplings to arbitrary sources .",
    "we focus on the phenomenologically interesting case of vector boson currents , though our construction of currents is applicable more generally .",
    "an important application of these currents is that they allow us to couple the electroweak theory to qcd , while taking full advantage of the csw formalism on the qcd side .",
    "the currents satisfy a similar color decomposition as the photon exchange amplitude  ( [ eezpartons ] ) , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the appropriate coupling for a vector boson @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the momentum carried by the vector boson .",
    "hence we need consider only the partial currents @xmath91 in much the same way that we need only consider color - ordered partial amplitudes .",
    "we start by defining two currents that will serve as new basic vertices for obtaining general vector boson currents :    1 .   a vector - boson current with @xmath0 gluon emissions , all of positive helicity @xmath92 where @xmath93 by momentum conservation , where ` @xmath94 ' as a spinor argument denotes @xmath95 , and where @xmath96 the vertex @xmath97 is simply a csw vertex for one photon , one quark pair , and @xmath98 gluons , obtained by fermionic phase adjustments from the amplitude in .",
    "+ if the helicity assignments of the fermions are reversed we instead have @xmath99 as well as a similar decomposition in polarizations . as with the basic csw vertices , when any colored leg @xmath11 is taken off shell , the @xmath49 argument to all spinor products or spinor strings",
    "must be replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "( the vector momentum @xmath100 is already off shell , and should _ not _ be replaced by @xmath101 if the latter is not already present in the above formul . ) 2 .",
    "a purely bosonic basic current emitting a single vector state , @xmath102    the first of these is the vector - boson current for positive helicity gluons  @xcite .",
    "the second is just a negative helicity polarization vector with reference momentum taken to be the csw reference momentum .",
    "the polarizations in the above equations are defined using the spinor helicity method and are given by  @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a null reference momentum .",
    "when evaluating expressions involving these polarizations , useful identities are @xmath105 and the fierz identity , @xmath106 we take the currents ( [ basicfermioniccurrent ] ) and ( [ basicgluoniccurrent ] ) to act as vertices , using the same csw prescriptions ( [ cswoffshell ] ) or ( [ offshellprescription ] ) as used for defining vertices from mhv amplitudes .",
    "the denominator of the first current ( [ basicfermioniccurrent ] ) contains only angle spinor products .",
    "that is , it depends only on on spinors @xmath107 and not on conjugate spinors @xmath108 , and hence is holomorphic in the spinor variables .",
    "accordingly , this current will have derivative - of - delta - function support in twistor space  @xcite .",
    "the denominator of the second current ( [ basicgluoniccurrent ] ) contains a bracket spinor product .",
    "it is thus analogous to the non - nhv amplitude vertices defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . to obtain general currents with an arbitrary number of negative helicity legs",
    "we follow the same csw rules for amplitudes , except that now we have two new vertices .    6 truein    to illustrate the construction of a current with more negative helicities , consider the nmhv vector boson current , @xmath109 where the negative helicity legs are nearest neighbors in the color ordering . the csw diagrams for this current",
    "may be organized using the four diagrams shown in , where the positive helicity gluon legs have all been stripped away .",
    "inserting back the positive helicity gluon legs , leads to the following expression for this nmhv vector boson current , @xmath110 where the momentum of the vector boson is @xmath111 .",
    "the explicit values of the current vertices are obtained from by relabeling the arguments .",
    "other nmhv helicity configurations are only a bit more complicated .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , bena and two of the authors introduced a recursive reformulation of the csw rules , useful when increasing the number of negative helicity legs .",
    "it introduces a higher - degree composite vertex , @xmath112 , carrying @xmath113 negative helicities defined in terms of two simpler off - shell vertices and a propagator via , @xmath114 where each term is included only if there is at least one negative - helicity gluon in the cyclic range @xmath115 $ ] and at least two in the range @xmath116 $ ] . the prime on the sum indicates the omission of any term with vanishing denominator .",
    "the subscript on @xmath117 indicates the number of colored legs .",
    "all indices are to be understood @xmath118 , and all sums in a cyclic sense , for example , @xmath119    the sums here have been modified from those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to include two - point vertices , which however vanish for purely colored legs .",
    "the two vertices in each term are then simpler in the sense that each has lower degree , that is fewer negative - helicity legs ( including the off - shell ones ) than the parent vertex .",
    "this means that this equation provides a recurrence relation for evaluating any tree - level non - mhv vertex in massless gauge theory , and therefore for evaluating any tree - level current or amplitude .",
    "note that the sum implicitly runs over different degrees for the two vertices on the right - hand side , because the number of negative - helicity external legs in @xmath115 $ ] can vary .",
    "indeed , the _ same _ recurrence relation also applies to the vector - boson currents considered in the present paper , so long as we interpret one of the indices as being the free vector index , and we define its ` helicity ' to be negative for bookkeeping purposes inside the sums .",
    "the vector index must be adjacent to both quark legs in the cyclic ordering .",
    "( now there is a non - vanishing two - point current to consider , which was the motivation for modifying the limits of the sums . in accordance with  ,",
    "the non - vector leg on this vertex also has two negative - helicity legs .",
    "two - point vertices without a vector index are taken to vanish . )",
    "alternatively , we could write out separate terms corresponding to higher - degree vertices analogous to those shown in",
    ". this would give us an expression that is a generalization of .",
    "the first three terms will be double sums ; the currents and vertices will be higher - degree objects ; and there will be an overall combinatoric factor as in .    extending this construction to multi - vector currents is straightforward when they are commuting ( @xmath120 ) , because we can then symmetrize on the vector legs . in this case , the corresponding basic vertices include those in , as well as additional vertices constructed from by replacing the one - photon vertex @xmath97 of with a multi - photon vertex , @xmath121 , where one photon is taken to have negative helicity , and the remainder , positive helicity . in , each vector - current index should be counted as a negative helicity for book - keeping purposes .",
    "the currents obtained using the vertices defined in the previous section and using csw diagrams ought to satisfy a number of non - trivial properties , such as current conservation . in addition , because as colorless vector - boson currents they are gauge invariant ( think of them as off - shell photon currents ) , we may suspect and that they will satisfy berends - giele recursion relations . they indeed do . because the vector boson currents are gauge invariant they should also match the previously - computed vector - boson currents with up to three gluons , as given in appendix  c of ref .  @xcite . by sewing together two currents with a vector boson propagator",
    ", we can obtain vector - boson exchange amplitudes .",
    "moreover , since the vector - boson leg is fully off shell it may be coupled to electroweak feynman diagrams , enhancing the applicability of csw diagrams to include processes mixing qcd and electroweak theory .",
    "the simplest requirement that any current should satisfy is conservation . with our construction ,",
    "the conservation of currents with arbitrary gluon helicities follows directly from current conservation of the basic currents ( [ basicfermioniccurrent ] ) and ( [ basicgluoniccurrent ] ) ; their conservation is unaffected by the csw off - shell continuations ( [ cswoffshell ] ) or ( [ offshellprescription ] ) .",
    "the current must also yield an amplitude when the off - shell leg is contracted with a photon polarization vector , and the on - shell limit is taken .",
    "for example , contract @xmath122 into the nmhv current ( [ nmhvcurrent ] ) , where @xmath104 is an arbitrary null reference momentum and take the limit @xmath123 , with @xmath124 . in this case , all but the last term in the current ( [ nmhvcurrent ] ) give vanishing contributions because , @xmath125 using and the fierz identity ( [ fierzidentity ] ) . in the last term in we obtain @xmath126 using , which cancels the factor of @xmath127 in the last term of .",
    "the remaining factor is just the desired amplitude , so we have , @xmath128 which is the required property .",
    "similarly , contracting @xmath129 with the current ( [ nmhvcurrent ] ) gives @xmath130 this may be recognized as the csw expression for an nmhv amplitude , confirming that @xmath131 following similar algebraic steps , it is then straightforward to demonstrate that for all possible helicity choices for gluons @xmath132 , and independent of the number of mhv vertices in each diagram , @xmath133 another property that currents should satisfy is that a product of two currents contracted with a vector boson propagator should give amplitudes with colorless vector boson exchange .",
    "for example , from the mhv currents ( [ basicfermioniccurrent ] ) and  ( [ basicfermioniccurrentb ] ) we may obtain the mhv partial amplitudes needed for vector boson exchange between a lepton and quark pair , given in , @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "this relation between the mhv amplitudes and currents continues to hold when the on - shell legs are taken off shell using the csw prescriptions  ( [ cswoffshell ] ) or  ( [ offshellprescription ] ) .",
    "using it is then straightforward to verify that amplitudes with larger numbers of negative - helicity gluons satisfy similar relations . for example , @xmath136 reproduces the csw expression for the nmhv single vector boson exchange amplitude ( [ nmhvvectorbosonexchange ] ) , as required .",
    "5 truein    a key property of the vector boson currents is that they may be coupled to off - shell electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "for example , consider the amplitude containing the non - abelian triple vector boson self coupling ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath137 coupling ) , @xmath138 , depicted in terms of feynman diagrams in . up to relabelings and a parity reflection , it corresponds to the amplitude in eq .",
    "( 2.23 ) of ref .",
    "as explained in that reference , the sum over these two diagrams is gauge invariant because its electroweak coupling constant differs from diagrams without a triple vector boson self - interaction and hence do not mix with them .",
    "1.8 truein    in our construction this amplitude factorizes into a product of two currents with the connecting propagator .",
    "one is the qcd vector boson current described by the nmhv current @xmath139 obtained by relabeling .",
    "the electroweak current containing the non - abelian triple vector boson interaction may easily be evaluated by working out the feynman diagrams shown in in feynman-t  hooft or any other gauge .",
    "we have verified that combining the two currents reproduces eq .",
    "( 2.23 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ( after accounting for a parity reflection and relabeling ) .",
    "of course , this example is sufficiently simple so that mhv diagrams are unnecessary .",
    "however , with the csw approach it is straightforward to incorporate larger numbers of quarks and gluons in the vector boson qcd current .",
    "the complete process also includes contributions in which both vector bosons couple directly to the fermion line , given in eqs .",
    "( 2.8 ) and  ( 2.22 ) of ref .",
    "we have verified that a symmetrized double - vector current constructed as described in the previous section reproduces the results of ref .",

    "these are obtained by reshuffling terms from the standard ones ( similar to the spirit of ref .",
    "we have used these to check currents computed using the recursive reformulation of the csw rules , as described in .",
    "we performed this comparison numerically , for all helicities up to @xmath141 legs ( in addition to the leg carrying the vector - boson index ) .",
    "we also checked selected helicities through @xmath142 .",
    "the twistor - inspired computational approach presented by cachazo , svrek , and witten is a novel way of computing tree amplitudes in massless gauge theories , including of course qcd .",
    "it relies on a basic set of vertices which are localized in a twistor - space sense .",
    "these vertices are particular off - shell continuations of the well - known parke  taylor amplitudes .",
    "the csw approach does not address the computation of amplitudes containing both colored and non - colored particles . in the context of the standard model , it does not , for example address the question of computing mixed qcd - electroweak processes .    in this paper",
    ", we have taken a step in this direction .",
    "we have shown how to incorporate an additional vector leg coupling to an arbitrary source into the csw approach .",
    "as we have discussed , multiple symmetrized vector legs ( @xmath120 ) follow with a straightforward modification .",
    "the propagators and diagrammatic rules are essentially unchanged ; it suffices to add new basic vertices with the additional vector leg(s ) .",
    "( unlike the csw construction , these vertices do include a two - point vertex . ) in our explicit examples , we have focused on coupling one off - shell electroweak vector boson to a single quark pair and any number of gluons .",
    "the structure of the csw construction implies that adding additional quark pairs should be straightforward .",
    "we expect that a similar approach can be used to construct multi-@xmath33s currents , and that ideas presented in this paper also generalize to currents for _ colored _ particles .",
    "these topics will be elaborated on elsewhere .    to date ,",
    "no - one has given a complete first - principles proof of the csw construction .",
    "nonetheless , there is very strong evidence in its favor .",
    "as pointed out in the original paper  @xcite , a csw computation automatically has the correct collinear and multiparticle - factorization limits .",
    "in addition , extensive numerical checks against berends  giele recurrence relations ( which were derived from first principles ) through relatively high multiplicity leave little room for doubt .    the factorization arguments also apply to the currents presented in this paper .",
    "we have implemented a light - cone version of the berends ",
    "giele recurrence relations  @xcite , and have shown complete agreement between currents computed using them , and currents computed using a recursive  @xcite reformulation of the csw rules .",
    "we performed these comparisons numerically , for up to ten legs ( in addition to the leg carrying the vector - boson index ) .",
    "photon amplitudes can be derived from the currents ( by contracting with a polarization vector , and taking the on - shell limit ) , and we have shown that these expressions reproduce the corresponding amplitudes as obtained directly from the csw rules , after adjusting the color factors to reflect the abelian nature of the photon .",
    "the currents we have constructed can be used directly in the computation of processes producing electroweak vector bosons .",
    "we are optimistic that further phenomenologically useful extensions of the csw approach will be possible .",
    "we would like to thank emil bjerrum - bohr , lance dixon and dave dunbar for helpful discussions .",
    "p.m. would also like to thank the university of zurich for its kind hospitality while this paper was being completed .",
