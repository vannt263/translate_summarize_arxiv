    "a straight drift - quadrupole system can not be designed in such a way that a particle transport through it will not depend on the difference in particle energies . moreover",
    ", this dependence can not be removed even in first order with respect to the energy deviations . one way to overcome this problem",
    "was developed in the past and consists in introducing bending of the central trajectory by a dipole field with subsequent usage of magnetic multipoles at suitable locations for correction of chromatic aberrations .",
    "however , it often would be desirable to produce achromatic ( i.e. energy independent ) focusing in a straight system , without involvement of bending magnets .",
    "because , according to the above discussion , it is not possible if one considers transport of individual particles starting from the same initial conditions in the transverse phase space but with different energies , we will consider the dynamics of a group of particles , i.e. particle ensembles .",
    "it is clear that the dynamics of a particle ensemble can be sufficiently different from the behavior of a single particle .",
    "for example , the set of particles uniformly distributed on the unit circle in the plane remains unchanged for an external observer after an arbitrary rotation around the origin of the coordinate system , while every single particle changes its position .",
    "so , instead of comparing the dynamics of two particles starting from the same transverse position but with different energies , we will compare the results of tracking through the system two monoenergetic particle ensembles .",
    "the transverse distributions of the particles within each ensemble are assumed to be uncoupled between horizontal and vertical degrees of freedom and , for both ensembles , are matched to the same courant - snyder quadratic forms .",
    "in other words , instead of the dynamics of particles we will study the propagation of functions , namely courant - snyder quadratic forms .    if one is interested only in the lowest order effects and because the map of a bend - free drift - quadrupole system does not have second order geometric aberrations",
    ", one can equivalently look at first order chromatic distortions of the betatron functions appearing after their transport through the system . from this point of view",
    "there are examples of drift - quadrupole beamlines for which by appropriate choice of incoming ( energy independent ) beta and alpha functions one can remove first ( and sometimes even second ) order chromatic distortion of the exit beta function .",
    "but , to the author s knowledge , it is only the paper  @xcite which explicitly gives an example of the focusing system for which first order chromatic distortions at the exit will vanish with appropriate choice of the entrance twiss parameters for both , exit beta and alpha functions .    in this paper",
    "we show that such a possibility is not a rare special case , but a general property . for every drift - quadrupole system ( which is not a pure drift space ) there exists an unique set of twiss parameters ( apochromatic twiss parameters ) , which will be transported through that system without first order chromatic distortions .",
    "moreover , we prove that at the same time these apochromatic twiss parameters minimize the absolute values of the system chromaticities and also bring the second order effect of the betatron oscillations on the difference of the average bunch path length from the path length of the reference particle to the minimal possible value ( see formula ( [ lm_2 ] ) below ) . and in the case of a gaussian beam they also minimize the effect of the betatron oscillations on the bunch lengthening .",
    "note that our interest in the problem of apochromatic beam transport was stimulated by the design of the beam distribution and transport lines for the european x - ray free - electron laser ( xfel ) facility , in particular by the design of matching sections and phase shifter of the post - linac collimation system  @xcite .",
    "one of the specifications to the design of this facility is the requirement for transport lines from linac to undulators to be able to accept bunches with different energy ( up to @xmath0 from nominal energy ) and transport them without noticeable deterioration of beam parameters .",
    "this will allow to fine - tune the fel wavelength by changing the electron beam energy without adjusting magnet strengths and , even more , will allow to scan the fel wavelength within a bunch train by appropriate programming of the low level rf system .",
    "as usual , we will take the path length along the reference orbit @xmath1 to be the independent variable and will use a complete set of symplectic variables @xmath2 as particle coordinates  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 measure the transverse displacements from the ideal orbit and @xmath4 are transverse canonical monenta scaled with the constant kinetic momentum of the reference particle @xmath5 . the variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 which describe longitudinal dynamics are    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the energy of the reference particle , its velocity in terms of the speed of light @xmath11 and its arrival time at a certain position @xmath12 , respectively",
    ".    we will represent particle passage through our system by a symplectic map @xmath13 that maps the dynamical variables @xmath14 from the location @xmath15 to the location @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath17 is the fixed point and that the map @xmath13 can be taylor expanded in its neighborhood .",
    "additionally we will assume that the transverse motion is dispersion free ( always true for the drift - quadrupole systems ) and uncoupled in linear approximation , which is a restriction on the form of the six by six symplectic matrix @xmath18 of the linear part of our map .",
    "let @xmath19 be some function of the variables @xmath14 given at the system entrance .",
    "then its image @xmath20 at the system exit under the action of the map @xmath13 is given by the following relation    @xmath21    which symbolically we will write as @xmath22 .",
    "let us consider some courant - snyder quadratic forms    @xmath23    given at the system entrance .",
    "we will say that the map @xmath13 is an @xmath24-order ( @xmath25 ) apochromat with respect to the incoming courant - snyder quadratic forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 if    @xmath28    we will call the twiss parameters that enter the courant - snyder quadratic forms satisfying ( [ ifb_3 ] ) apochromatic twiss parameters .",
    "note that though in this paper we will discuss second - order apochromats only , we have the design of a drift - quadrupole system which is a third - order apochromat and we will present this design in a separate publication .    up to any predefined order @xmath24 the aberrations of the map",
    "@xmath13 can be represented through a lie factorization as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes equality up to order @xmath24 and each of the functions @xmath31 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath32 in the variables @xmath33 .    using this representation we can state that the map @xmath13 will be @xmath24-order apochromat with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath27 if , and only if , all homogeneous polynomials @xmath31 in ( [ ifb_4 ] ) can be expressed as functions of @xmath34 and @xmath7 only .",
    "the hamiltonian of the drift - quadrupole system expanded up to third order in the variables @xmath33 then takes the form @xmath35 where    @xmath36    @xmath37    and @xmath38 is the quadrupole coefficient .",
    "let @xmath39 be a fundamental matrix solution of the linearized system with the elements @xmath40 driven by hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 entering formula ( [ ifb_4 ] ) can be found as    @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are quadratic forms .    from ( [ mkj_1 ] )",
    "one sees that the map of the drift - quadrupole system does not have second order geometric aberrations and that the transverse motion still remains uncoupled with first nonlinear correction terms taken into account .",
    "so we will restrict our further consideration to the motion in one degree of freedom ( horizontal ) .",
    "let us denote    @xmath47    the coefficients of this form are given by the integrals    @xmath48    @xmath49    and therefore satisfy cauchy - bunyakovsky inequality    @xmath50    where , as it is not difficult to prove , the equality holds if , and only if , @xmath51 , i.e. if our system is the pure drift space .",
    "so if @xmath52 then the quadratic form @xmath45 is negative - definite and therefore , according to the statement at the end of the previous section , there exist unique apochromatic twiss parameters given by the following expressions    @xmath53",
    "the quantities which are usually used in accelerator physics for the description of the first - order chromatic effects are chromaticity and two betatron amplitude difference functions  @xcite .",
    "it is intuitively clear that all of them must be connected with each other and with the chromatic map aberrations .",
    "unfortunately the usual ways of their introduction are formally different and do not allow immediately to see such a connection . in this section",
    "we introduce chromatic variables as coefficients of the expansion of the quadratic form ( [ mkj_2 ] ) with respect to three independent quadratic invariants of linear motion .",
    "one of these variables coincides with the usual chromaticity and two others ( apochromaticities ) can be expressed through betatron amplitude difference functions using rotation and scaling .",
    "it is well known that for the linear dynamics the courant - snyder quadratic form is an invariant of motion .",
    "it is much less known that in the linear case there are other invariants which depend on betatron phase and together with the courant - snyder invariant form a basis in the space of polynomials  @xcite . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we need only two of them given by the following formulas    @xmath54    where    @xmath55      we define chromaticity @xmath56 and apochromaticities @xmath57 and @xmath58 as coefficients in the representation    @xmath59    comparing ( [ dd_1 ] ) with ( [ mkj_2 ] ) we obtain    @xmath60    from these formulas it is not difficult to derive the following important equality    @xmath61    with the representation ( [ dd_1 ] ) the image of the courant - snyder quadratic form after passage through the system is    @xmath62    and one sees that this quadratic form will be apochromatic if , and only if , @xmath63 .",
    "this together with ( [ dd_5 ] ) tells us that apochromatic incoming twiss parameters simultaneously are the twiss parameters which minimize the absolute value of the system chromaticity .",
    "note that for drift - quadrupole systems chromatic variables can be represented also in the form of the integrals    @xmath64    @xmath65 d \\tau , \\label{canda_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath66 d \\tau .",
    "\\label{canda_3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "to see more clearly the effect of the betatron oscillations on the longitudinal motion , let us assume that the beam at the system entrance is monoenergetic with @xmath67 for all particles .",
    "if the beam distribution is uncoupled between the degrees of freedom then      where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the non - normalized rms emittances and the chromaticities @xmath71 and @xmath72 are calculated using the beam twiss parameters . if , additionally , we will assume that the particle distributions in each transverse plane are gaussian , then we can also obtain the following formula for the effect of the betatron oscillations on the bunch lengthening"
