    "soon after the discovery by hawking @xcite that black holes possess temperature , davies @xcite and unruh @xcite , following the work of fulling @xcite , showed that observers moving with constant proper acceleration in flat spacetime see the minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath with temperature @xmath0 @xcite . the unruh effect has deservedly become the prime flat - spacetime example illustrating a deep connection between relativity , quantum mechanics , and thermodynamics .    in this paper",
    "we show that rindler observers ( i.e. , observers moving in flat spacetime with constant proper acceleration ) are rather special in their identification of the minkowski vacuum as a thermal state .",
    "we make use of the non - uniformly accelerating observer ( nuao ) solution found in @xcite , where observers accelerate to terminal velocities less than the speed of light , to study the properties of the minkowski vacuum seen by this accelerating observer .    in sec . ii we give a brief review of quantum field theory in non - inertial reference frames , followed by a detailed calculation of the creation and annihilation operators seen by our nuaos .",
    "we show that these accelerating observers see a bose - einstein distribution of particles , which strongly suggests the definition of a pseudo - temperature in analogy with the unruh temperature .    in sec .",
    "iii , we justify that this is indeed a",
    "_ pseudo_-temperature .",
    "we solve for the complete expansion of the minkowski vacuum in terms of the accelerating observer s particle number states .",
    "furthermore , we prove that our nuaos experience the minkowski vacuum as a single - mode squeezed state and not the typical two - mode squeezed state seen by rindler observers .",
    "this single - mode pure quantum state does not allow for a natural reduction to a mixed state , and the thermal state characteristic of the unruh effect never enters the physics detected by the nuao .",
    "the absence of a thermal state invalidates the seemingly natural definition of temperature suggested by the bose - einstein distribution of particles measured by the nuao .",
    "iv is concerned with the differences between that of a rindler observer and our nuao .",
    "we discuss the physics of our nuaos in the context of squeezed states , entanglement , black hole physics , and the physical implications thereof . a final remark on general accelerations is given .",
    "we begin with a massless scalar field and show that non - uniformly accelerating observers see a bose - einstein distribution for the expectation value of the number operator @xmath1 in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "@xmath2 we change to light cone coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the wave equation becomes @xmath5 the general solution to ( [ waveuv ] ) is @xmath6 the left @xmath7 and right @xmath8 moving solutions to the field equation are non - interacting ; for brevity , we analyze the left - moving solution @xmath9 .",
    "we expand the field in terms of fourier modes as follows : @xmath10\\ ] ] where the creation @xmath11 and annihilation @xmath12 operators for the minkowski observer obey the standard ( discretized ) commutation relation @xmath13 = \\delta_{\\omega\\omega^\\prime}$ ] .    the non - uniformly accelerating observer under consideration sees the following metric @xcite : @xmath14 where the parameter @xmath15 is related to the acceleration and the initial velocity of the observer .",
    "if we switch to light cone coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the accelerating frame , the metric becomes @xmath18 the relationship of @xmath19 , @xmath20 to the corresponding minkowski coordinates @xmath21 , @xmath22 is given by  @xcite @xmath23 note that both coordinate systems @xmath24 and @xmath25 cover the entire spacetime and there is no problem with the origin in the accelerating frame @xcite . in other words , the acceleration of the nuao",
    "does not become infinite as we approach the origin . additionally , this results in a single pair of creation and annihilation operators for the accelerating observer , in contrast to the two pairs required for uniformly accelerating observers .",
    "the equation satisfied by the scalar field in the accelerating observer s coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 is formally identical to ( [ waveuv ] ) .",
    "@xmath26 the solution is then analogous to ( [ waveuvsol ] ) . selecting again the left - moving solution we write @xmath27\\ ] ] in terms of the fourier modes .",

    "we identify equations ( [ phiv ] ) and ( [ phiv ] ) and solve for the creation and annihilation operators in the accelerating frame .",
    "we multiply by @xmath31 and integrate over @xmath20 to obtain @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33\\ ] ] we refer to equations ( [ uv ] ) and replace @xmath34 in the exponentials inside the integral .",
    "the integral formula for the modified bessel function of the second kind @xcite @xmath35 is valid when @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , using the fact that @xmath38 , we have    @xmath39\\ ] ]    at this point , the integral diverges , of course , and a regularization procedure must be adopted .",
    "the details do not matter for our purposes , since our results will be independent of the specific regularization procedure . denoting by @xmath40 the combination @xmath41 we may write the expression for @xmath28 as @xmath42 similarly , taking the adjoint of equation ( [ bdag ] )",
    "gives the following expression for @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath43    we may now isolate the operator @xmath44 that annihilates the minkowski vacuum @xmath45 by solving the system of equations ( [ bdag ] ) and ( [ bbdag ] ) for @xmath46 . @xmath47",
    "the combination @xmath48 therefore annihilates the minkowski vacuum , @xmath49 we construct the number operator @xmath50 for the accelerating observer and determine the average particle number @xmath51 . using equation ( [ bb0 ] )",
    "we find that the norm of the state @xmath52 is @xmath53 finally , we use the commutator @xmath54= 1 $ ] on the right side of equation ( [ norm ] ) to obtain @xmath55 equation ( [ <",
    "n > ] ) shows that the non - uniformly accelerating observer sees a bose - einstein distribution in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "one would therefore expect to be able to define a temperature from @xmath56 and @xmath57 as @xmath58 directly from the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "although the association of the state with a temperature seems well justified , we now show that this is not the case .",
    "we expand the minkowski vacuum state in terms of the accelerating observer s number eigenstates .",
    "@xmath59 are calculated by repeated action of the @xmath28 creation operators on the accelerating observer s vacuum state @xmath60 .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath61 and write @xmath62 in terms of products of annihilation operators acting to the left .",
    "@xmath63 equation ( [ bb0 ] ) in combination with repeated applications of the commutator @xmath54= 1 $ ] yields @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number operator . iterating the process for @xmath66 , @xmath67 we find @xmath68 we relabel @xmath69 by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of pairs of particles ; this allows us to write a summation over all @xmath71 .",
    "the expansion of the minkowski vacuum becomes @xmath72 by left - multiplying by @xmath73 , replacing @xmath74 with our result from equation ( [ nmvac2 ] ) and switching the order of product and summation .",

    "replacing this result for the vacuum - to - vacuum transition amplitude into equation ( [ mvacexp ] ) determines the expansion of the minkowski vacuum in terms of pairs of bosons to be @xmath78 ) as an operator relationship between the two vacuum states is easily accomplished , @xmath79 ) is equivalent to @xmath80 \\big\\ } \\ , |0\\rangle\\ ] ] note that the operator acting on @xmath81 is unitary and is in fact the product of squeezing operators for single - mode states @xcite .",
    "this shows explicitly that the minkowski vacuum @xmath45 is a single - mode squeezed @xmath81 vacuum , and equation ( [ < n > ] ) may now be seen to be in agreement with a well - known result in quantum optics .",
    "we have shown that the minkowski vacuum is perceived as a pure single - mode squeezed state by the accelerating observer .    in the case of uniformly accelerating rindler observers ,",
    "the same minkowski vacuum is perceived as a pure two - mode squeezed state . however , rindler observers see an event horizon which forces a tracing , in either the left or right wedge , over inaccessible entangled degrees of freedom .",
    "the loss of entangled information reduces the pure density matrix @xmath82 to a thermal mixture .    in the case of the non - uniformly accelerating observer , there is no need for an equivalent tracing over inaccessible degrees of freedom , or even a motivation for doing such a thing given that this observer sees no event horizon and has complete access to the entire spacetime .",
    "therefore , defining a temperature @xmath83 is not justified despite the fact that the bose - einstein nature of the particle number distribution appears to suggest a thermal state",
    ".    stated differently , thermal states should not be associated with accelerations in general , but only with accelerations capable of introducing horizons in the frame of the accelerating observer .",
    "even constant acceleration does not guarantee the existence of a temperature @xcite .    from the point of view of black hole physics ,",
    "the observers considered in this paper are in a sense  intermediate \" between freely falling and stationary observers",
    ". it would be interesting to see if these observers can shed any additional light on the issues of black hole complementarity and firewalls @xcite .",
    "we thank s. deser for bringing ref .",
    "@xcite to our attention .",
    "we have already noted that equation ( [ temp ] ) can not be interpreted as the temperature of the particle distribution detected by our accelerating observer . of course , a similar definition _ is _ warranted in the case of a rindler observer .",
    "this naturally raises the question as to whether the unruh temperature can be obtained from our results .    at first sight",
    "it may appear that we have two incompatible expressions , since the rindler observer is the @xmath84 limit of our nuao .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the limit should be taken as the nuao s incoming velocity @xmath85 with the product @xmath86 fixed , where @xmath87 is the gamma factor associated with @xmath88 . furthermore , in this limit the relationship between the observer s time @xmath89 and the proper time @xmath90 becomes @xmath91 .",
    "this implies that energies and temperatures defined with respect to the proper time must include a gamma factor ; in particular , @xmath92 replaces equation ( [ temp ] ) .",
    "since @xmath93 , as @xmath94 @xcite , the temperature becomes @xmath95 and we have agreement with the unruh temperature .",
    "we check our expansion of the vacuum state by an independent calculation of the expectation value for the number operator . from equation ( [ completeexpansion ] ) , @xmath96 is @xmath97 the number operator acting on the states gives @xmath98 .",
    "substitution of @xmath99 from ( [ nmvac2 ] ) then yields @xmath100 equations ( [ exactsum ] ) and ( [ zdef ] ) imply that the infinite product will produce a cancellation of every @xmath101 factor in the product , with a corresponding term in the normalization , except when @xmath102 . hence",

    "the result is @xmath104 this is the same bose - einstein distribution found in section 2 ."
