    "<S> we give four positive formulae for the ( equioriented type  @xmath0 ) quiver polynomials of buch and fulton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all four formulae are combinatorial , in the sense that they are expressed in terms of combinatorial objects of certain types : zelevinsky permutations , lacing diagrams , young tableaux , and pipe dreams ( also known as rc - graphs ) . </S>",
    "<S> three of our formulae are multiplicity - free and geometric , meaning that their summands have coefficient  @xmath1 , and correspond bijectively to components of a torus - invariant scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining ( presently non - geometric ) formula was conjectured for by buch and fulton in terms of factor sequences of young tableaux  @xcite ; our proof of it proceeds by way of a new characterization of the tableaux counted by quiver constants . </S>",
    "<S> all four formulae come naturally in `` doubled '' versions , two for _ double quiver polynomials _ , and the other two for their stable versions , the _ double quiver functions _ , where setting half the variables equal to the other half specializes to the ordinary case .    </S>",
    "<S> our method begins by identifying quiver polynomials as multidegrees @xcite via equivariant chow groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then we make use of zelevinsky s map from quiver loci to open subvarieties of schubert varieties in partial flag manifolds @xcite . interpreted in equivariant cohomology , </S>",
    "<S> this lets us write double quiver polynomials as ratios of double schubert polynomials @xcite associated to zelevinsky permutations ; this is our first formula . in  the process </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a simple argument that zelevinsky maps are scheme - theoretic isomorphisms ( originally proved in  @xcite using standard monomial theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> writing double schubert polynomials in terms of pipe dreams @xcite then provides another geometric formula for double quiver polynomials , via @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the combinatorics of pipe dreams for zelevinsky permutations implies an expression for double quiver functions in terms of products of stanley symmetric functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a  degeneration of quiver loci ( orbit closures of @xmath2 on quiver representations ) to unions of products of matrix schubert varieties @xcite identifies the summands in our stanley function formula combinatorially , as lacing diagrams that we construct based on the strands of abeasis and delfra in the representation theory of quivers @xcite . finally , we apply the combinatorial theory of key polynomials to pass from our lacing diagram formula to a double schur function formula in terms of peelable tableaux @xcite , and from there to a ` double stable ' generalization of the buch  fulton conjecture .              </S>",
    "<S> universal formulae for cohomology classes appear in a number of different guises . in topology , </S>",
    "<S> classes with attached names of pontrjagin , chern , and stiefel  whitney arise as obstructions to vector bundles having linearly independent sections . </S>",
    "<S> universality of formulae for these and other more general classes can be traced , for our purposes , to the fact that they  the formulae as well as the classes  live canonically on classifying spaces , from which they are pulled back to arbitrary spaces by classifying  maps .    in algebra , </S>",
    "<S> cohomology classes on certain kinds of varieties ( projective space , for example ) are called ` degrees ' , and many universal formulae show up in degree calculations for classical ideals , such as those generated by minors of fixed size in generic matrices @xcite ( or see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * chapter  14 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in geometry , pioneering work of r.thom @xcite associated cohomology classes to sets of _ critical points _ of generic maps between manifolds , where the differential drops rank . using slightly different language , </S>",
    "<S> the set of critical points can be characterized as the _ degeneracy locus _ for the associated morphism of tangent bundles . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently there have appeared numerous extensions of thom s notion of degeneracy locus , such as to maps between pairs of arbitrary vector bundles .    </S>",
    "<S> the cohomology classes poincar dual to degeneracy loci for ( certain collections of ) morphisms of complex vector bundles are expressible as polynomials in the chern roots of the given vector bundles . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be a general principle that coefficients in universal such expressions as sums of simpler polynomials always seem to be governed by combinatorial rules . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs , for example , in @xcite . however , even when it is possible to prove an explicit combinatorial formula , it has usually been unclear how the geometry of degeneracy loci reflects the combinatorics  directly .    </S>",
    "<S> our original motivation for this work was to close this gap , by bringing combinatorial universal formulae for cohomology classes of degeneracy loci into the realm of geometry , continuing the point of view set forth in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we reduce to the algebraic perspective mentioned above in terms of degrees of determinantal ideals , by way of the topological perspective mentioned above in terms of classifying spaces , as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction then allows us to manufacture formulae that are simultaneously geometric as well as combinatorial , by applying flat degenerations of subvarieties inside finite - dimensional torus representations . </S>",
    "<S> the cohomology class remains unchanged in the degeneration , and then it is given by summing the classes of all components of the special  fiber .    </S>",
    "<S> the degenerations we employ result from one - parameter linear torus actions , and hence have grbner bases as their natural language . </S>",
    "<S> our theorems on orbit closures and their combinatorics explicitly generalize results from the theory of ideals generated by minors of fixed size in generic matrices , where the prototypical result is giambelli s degree formula @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ideals that interest us here are generated by minors in _ products _ of generic matrices . </S>",
    "<S> it is intriguing that our combinatorial analysis of these general determinantal ideals proceeds ( using the ` zelevinsky map ' ) via schubert determinantal ideals @xcite , which are generated by minors of varying sizes in a _ single _ matrix of variables . </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary schubert conditions may seem , consequently , to be in some sense more general ; but while this may be true , the special form taken by the schubert rank conditions on single matrices here give rise to a substantially richer combinatorial structure . </S>",
    "<S> this richness is fully borne out only by combining methods based on schubert determinantal ideals with an approach in terms of minors in products of generic matrices , which is rooted more directly in representation theory of quivers .    </S>",
    "<S> our technique of orbit degeneration automatically produces positive geometric formulae that are universal , since they essentially live on classifying spaces . </S>",
    "<S> however , there still remains the elucidation of what combinatorics most naturally describes these formulae , or indexes its components . </S>",
    "<S> well over half of our exposition in this paper is dedicated to unearthing rich and often surprising interconnections between a number of combinatorial objects , some known and some new . combinatorics  of objects including zelevinsky permutations , lacing diagrams , young tableaux , and pipe dreams ( also known as rc - graphs)forms the bridge between positive geometric formulae and the explicit algebra of several families of polynomials , including schur functions , schubert polynomials , stanley symmetric functions , and now quiver polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> working in the broader context of double quiver polynomials and their stable versions , the double quiver functions , allows the extra flexibility required for our proof of the buch  fulton conjecture  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> special cases of this conjecture appear in @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> we would like to thank anders buch and bill fulton for suggesting the problem that concerns us here , and for patiently listening , with sergey fomin , richard stanley , and alex yong , to endless hours of us presenting potential and actual methods toward its solution . </S>",
    "<S> frank sottile and chris woodward invited us to their superb ams special session on modern schubert calculus at northeastern university in october 2002 ; we are indebted to them for the opportunity at that meeting both to present our positivity proof for the quiver constants and our conjectural component formula , as well as to learn of @xcite for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we are grateful to the banff international research station ( birs ) , as well as the organizers of the may 2003 meeting on algebraic combinatorics there , for bringing the three of us together into the same room for the first time , thereby allowing us to complete the first version of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> comments that improved the exposition were provided by anders buch , bill fulton , peter magyar , .      </S>",
    "<S> the formulae we consider in this paper are for cohomology classes of degeneracy loci for type  @xmath0 equioriented quivers of vector bundles . </S>",
    "<S> this simply means we start with sequences of vector bundle morphisms over a fixed base . </S>",
    "<S> since we immediately reduce in theorem  [ t : bftokms ] to considering the equivariant classes of universal degeneracy loci , or quiver loci ( to be defined shortly ) , we present our exposition in that context , refering the reader to @xcite for an introduction in the language of vector bundles . </S>",
    "<S> we work over an arbitrary field  @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the vector space @xmath4 of sequences of linear transformations between vector spaces of dimensions @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> we assume throughout that @xmath22 for some matrix list @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a nontrivial condition equivalent to the irreducibility of  @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it means that @xmath13 is an orbit closure for the group @xmath24 that acts on  @xmath4 by change of basis in each vector space  @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath13 is stable under the action of any torus in  @xmath26 . picking a maximal torus  @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we define the _ quiver polynomial _ as the @xmath28-multidegree of  @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in proposition  [ p : chow ] that this polynomial coincides with the @xmath28-equivariant class of  @xmath13 in the chow ring @xmath29 , or alternatively in cohomology when @xmath30 . this chow ring is a polynomial ring  @xmath31 $ ] over the integers in an alphabet  @xmath32 of size @xmath33 , the union of bases @xmath34 for the weight lattices of the maximal tori in  @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> since  @xmath13 is stable under  @xmath26 and not just the torus  @xmath28 , its equivariant class is symmetric in each of the alphabets  @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> more naturally , this is precisely the statement that the quiver polynomial lies inside @xmath37 , and in this sense does not depend on our choice of  @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we express the quiver polynomial determined by the rank array  @xmath15 as @xmath38 for reasons that should become clear in the ratio formula and double  versions .    </S>",
    "<S> next we present our four positive combinatorial formulae for quiver polynomials , in the same order that we will prove them in the main body of the text . besides making the overview of their proofs more coherent , this choice will serve to emphasize an important point that is worth bearing in mind before seeing the statements : while each formula stands well enough on its own , this paper is not merely a catalog of four different perspectives on quiver loci . </S>",
    "<S> the principles underlying each formula seep throughout the others , infusing all of them with just enough additional insight to make the proofs work . </S>",
    "<S> the interdependencies will become increasingly clear as we sketch the proofs later in this introduction .    for each formula </S>",
    "<S> , we shall give here a precise statement , although many details of definitions will be left for later . </S>",

    "<S> the bad news ( remark  [ rk : ssww ] ) is the subtle fact that replacing @xmath72 with  @xmath178 in the schubert version _ always _ yields a false statement whenever @xmath121 contains more than one lacing diagram !    the two aspects itemized above split the proof into two essentially disjoint parts : a geometric argument producing a lower bound , and a combinatorial argument producing an upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion comes by noticing that the lower bound is visibly at least as high as the upper bound , so that both must be equal . </S>",
    "<S> let us make this vague description more precise , starting with the geometric lower bound .    </S>",
    "<S> the mere existence of the flat degeneration we introduce in section  [ sec : quivdegen ] automatically implies that the ordinary quiver polynomial @xmath38 is a sum of double schubert products @xmath123 , with positive integer coefficients possibly greater than  @xmath1 ( corollary  [ c : quivschub ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the components in the degeneration are products of matrix schubert varieties , possibly nonreduced a  priori ( theorem  [ t : degen ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is easy to verify that the orbit through each lacing diagram in  @xmath121 appears with multiplicity at least  @xmath1 ( proposition  [ p : lace ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the fundamental observations in @xcite gained by viewing quiver polynomials as ordinary classes of degeneracy loci for vector bundle maps on arbitary schemes is that nothing vital changes when the ranks of all the bundles are increased by  @xmath1 , or by any fixed integer  @xmath179 . </S>",
    "<S> the key observation for us along these lines is that this stability under uniformly increasing ranks can be proved directly for the total families of quiver locus degenerations  and hence for components in the special fiber , including their scheme structures  by a direct geometric argument ( proposition  [ p : stability ] ) . it does not require knowing anything in advance about the special fibers of such degenerations . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the previous paragraph , which a  priori only gives existence of a schubert polynomial component formula along with lower bounds on its coefficients , in fact proves the _ same _ existence and lower bounds for an ordinary stanley function component formula , simply by taking limits .    </S>",
    "<S> the combinatorial argument producing an upper bound is based on the partition of the pipe dreams in  @xmath173 into strip classes , and it automatically works in the ` double ' setting , with @xmath51 and  @xmath65 alphabets . </S>",
    "<S> summing @xmath180 over reduced pipe dreams  @xmath95 with strip equivalence class  @xmath116 yields a polynomial that , while not actually equal to  @xmath181 because of the bad news above , agrees with @xmath181 in all coefficients on monomials all of whose variables appear `` not too late '' in the alphabets @xmath34 and @xmath182 ( this follows from corollary  [ c : bottom ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this observation depends subtly on the combinatorics of reduced pipe dreams and the symmetry of @xmath166 in each of its @xmath183 alphabets ( proposition  [ p : sym ] ) .    just as in the geometric argument </S>",
    "<S> , we have a stability statement ; here , it says that strip classes are stable under uniform increase in rank ( corollary  [ c : w ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , summing over all strip classes and taking the limit as ranks uniformly become infinite yields theorem  [ t : stanley ] , the `` existence and upper bound theorem '' for _ double quiver functions _  , and the double stanley symmetric function component formula for them . </S>",
    "<S> the formula says that  @xmath184 is a multiplicity - free sum of double stanley symmetric function products @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the rank array obtained from  @xmath15 by adding  @xmath179 to every entry . that the sum is over strip classes , </S>",
    "<S> whose lacing diagrams automatically lie inside  @xmath121 by theorem  [ t : lacing ] , implies the upper bound : the coefficients on  @xmath185 is  @xmath1 if @xmath116 indexes a strip class , and zero otherwise .    after specializing the strip class component formula for double quiver functions to @xmath167 , </S>",
    "<S> the lower and upper bounds are forced to match . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the preceding arguments culminate in the following master component formula ( theorem  [ t : lace ] ) , which is arguably the single most important result in the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> theorem ( stable double component formula for double quiver functions ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath187    part of this statement is the important combinatorial observation that every minimal lacing diagram indexes a strip class ( corollary  [ l : w ] ) . for another corollary , </S>",
    "<S> the somewhat mysteriously constructed combinatorial upper bound magically implies the geometric multiplicity  @xmath1 statement we were after : components in the degenerated quiver locus are generically reduced ( theorem  [ t : components ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finally yields the schubert version of the component formula for ordinary quiver polynomials ; and we of course also recover the ordinary stanley version .    to convey a better feel for what limits have accomplished here , let us summarize the fundamental principle that drives most of our logic . </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of geometric , algebraic , and combinatorial objects that we are unable to get a precise handle on directly . </S>",
    "<S> these objects include the components in quiver degenerations , as well as their multiplicities ; the sum of all monomials associated to pipe dreams in a fixed strip class ; and the set of lacing diagrams indexing strip classes for a fixed zelevinsky permutation . </S>",
    "<S> the key realization is that , even though we fail to identify these objects precisely , we can prove their stability under uniformly increasing ranks , and in the limit it becomes possible to identify the desired objects exactly . </S>",
    "<S> hence our failures occurred only because we fixed the ranks to begin with .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that our failures in fixed finite rank are not always artifacts of our proof technique . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the sum of monomials for pipe dreams in a fixed strip class  @xmath116 really _ is nt _ equal to the stanley product  @xmath129 or the schubert product  @xmath188 ; it _ only _ becomes so in the limit . </S>",
    "<S> we take this opportunity to remark that a stability statement holds also for peelable tableaux ( corollary  [ c : peellim ] ) ; though it turned out to be unnecessary for the proofs in this final version , it was essential in an earlier draft .      </S>",
    "<S> the substitution @xmath189 has no real geometric motivation for us , even though we knew from the start that can be interpreted directly in terms of equivariant classes of zelevinsky matrix schubert varieties , and in hindsight it is likely possible to make a functorial construction on vector bundles that produces double quiver polynomials as degeneracy locus formulae . </S>",
    "<S> our reason for seriously considering double quiver polynomials is different : we need to be able to set the second set of alphabets to zero . </S>",
    "<S> observe that when @xmath167 , such a procedure succeeds in killing almost all terms in the ordinary versions .    at a crucial point in our derivation of the peelable tableau formula from a component formula </S>",
    "<S> ( see remark  [ rk : y=0 ] ) , we need certain key polynomials to equal the products of schur polynomials that they a  priori only approximate . </S>",
    "<S> we check this by applying the theory of demazure characters via isobaric divided differences ( section  [ sec : sums ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> but these have only been developed for ordinary ( not double ) schubert polynomials , so we must work with ratios @xmath190 of ordinary schubert polynomials obtained from double quiver polynomials by setting  .    to be a little more precise , </S>",
    "<S> consider the two sides of the equation @xmath191 which we prove in proposition  [ p : qqrr ] from the stable double component formula . </S>",
    "<S> both sides expand into sums of products @xmath192 of ordinary schur polynomials , the left side by demazure characters , and the right side by using the fact that each summand is a product of symmetric polynomials in the sequence  @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this formula explains why we need double versions , and simultaneously provides yet another reason why we need stable versions : schur - expansion of the left hand side demands double versions because it requires @xmath193 , while schur - expansion of the right hand side demands stability because it requires the summands to be symmetric functions . </S>",
    "<S> note that if the products of stanley functions in the right hand sum are replaced by products of schubert polynomials , then the resulting statement is always false whenever there are at least two summands ( remark  [ rk : ssww ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in theorem  [ t : bla ] that the coefficients in the schur - expansion of the right hand side are the quiver constants from @xcite , while the above demazure character argument implies that the coefficients on the left hand side are stanley coefficients ( theorem  [ t : qc = ss ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these count peelable tableaux , proving the peelable tableau formula . </S>",
    "<S> the factor sequence conjecture follows from the peelable tableau formula via the bijection  @xmath158 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of this bijection in section  [ part : fs ] is a complex but essentially elementary computation . </S>",
    "<S> it works by breaking the diagram  @xmath150 into pieces small enough so that putting them back together in different ways yields peelable tableaux on the one hand , and .      </S>",
    "<S> quiver loci have been studied by a number of authors in their roles as universal degeneracy loci for vector bundle morphisms , as generalizations of schubert varieties , and in representation theory of quivers ; see @xcite , for a sample . </S>",
    "<S> the particular rank conditions we consider here appeared first in @xcite , as the culmination of an increasingly general progression of degeneracy loci . </S>",
    "<S> snapshots from this progression include the following ; for more on the history , see @xcite .    * the case of two vector bundles and a fixed map required to have rank bounded by a given integer is known as the giambelli  </S>",
    "<S> thom  </S>",
    "<S> porteous formula ; see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * chapter  14.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( in this case , both the ratio formula and the component formula reduce directly to the giambelli  </S>",
    "<S> thom  </S>",
    "<S> porteous formula : the denominator in the ratio formula equals  @xmath1 , while its numerator is the appropriate schur polynomial ; and there is just one lacing diagram , with no crossing laces . ) </S>",
    "<S> * given two filtered vector bundles , there are degeneracy loci defined by schubert conditions bounding the ranks of induced morphisms from subbundles in the filtration of the source to quotients by those in the target . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting universal formulae are double schubert polynomials  @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> the same schubert conditions can be placed on a quiver like those considered here , with @xmath194 bundles of ranks increasing from  @xmath1 up to  @xmath195 and then decreasing from  @xmath195 down to  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy locus formula produces polynomials that fulton called ` universal schubert polynomials ' @xcite , because they specialize to quantum and double schubert polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to call them _ </S>",
    "<S> fulton polynomials_. results similar to the ones we prove here have been obtained independently for the special case of fulton polynomials in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one can consider even more general quiver loci and degeneracy loci , for arbitrary quivers and arbitrary rank conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the resulting quiver polynomials should have interesting combinatorial descriptions , at least for finite type quivers . </S>",
    "<S> some indications of this come from @xcite , where the same general idea of reducing to the equivariant study of quiver loci also appears ( but the specifics differ in what kinds of statements are made concerning quiver polynomials ) , along with rimnyi s thom polynomial proof of the component formula @xcite , which he produced in response to seeing the formula .    for nilpotent cyclic quivers the orbit degeneration works just as for the type @xmath196 quiver considered in this paper , and the zelevinsky map can be replaced by lusztig s embedding of a nilpotent cyclic quiver into a partial flag variety @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the technique of orbit degeneration might also extend to arbitrary finite type quivers , but zelevinsky maps do not extend in any straightforward way . </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages of orbit degeneration is that it not only implies existence of a combinatorial formula , but provides strong hints ( proposition  [ p : lace ] ) as to the format of such a formula . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in contrast to @xcite , where much of the work lay in `` discovering the shape of the formula '' , the geometry of degeneration provides a blueprint  automatically .    among the cohomological statements in this paper </S>",
    "<S> lurks a single result in : theorem  [ t : ratio ] gives a combinatorial formula for quiver -classes as ratios of double grothendieck polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> this -theoretic analogue of the ratio formula ( which is cohomological ) immediately implies the -theoretic analogue of our pipe formula by @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section  5 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a -theoretic generalization of our component formula ( including the stable double version ) , proved independently in two papers subsequent to this one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it implies buch s conjecture @xcite that the -theoretic analogues of the quiver constants  @xmath137 exhibit a certain sign alternation , generalizing the positivity  of  @xmath137 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting problem to find a -theoretic analogue of the factor sequence tableau formula . </S>",
    "<S> substantial work in this direction has already been done by buch @xcite . in analogy with our proof of the cohomological buch  </S>",
    "<S> fulton factor sequence conjecture , a complete combinatorial description of its -theoretic analogue will involve a better understanding of how stable grothendieck polynomials indexed by permutations expand into stable grothendieck polynomials indexed by partitions . </S>",
