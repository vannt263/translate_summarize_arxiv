    "macroscopic electromagnetism remains a central component in describing a large variety of interactions between light and matter .",
    "the electromagnetic response of macroscopic materials is routinely captured by an electric permittivity , and the permittivity itself can often be fitted to a simple function of frequency that belies the complexity of the underlying microscopic physics .",
    "typically the permittivity @xmath0 of a dielectric is expected to take the form @xmath1 , corresponding to a series of broadened resonances with attendant absorption  @xcite .",
    "a simple argument  @xcite , based on a polarizable particle with damping together with the assumption of a rarified material , leads to this formula for the permittivity .",
    "it is however difficult to justify this result with a more realistic model  @xcite . in particular , when one requires the absorption of light to emerge from the model without being put in by hand as a damping term , one faces some difficult calculations  @xcite . a classic paper by hopfield in 1958  @xcite elucidated the connection between the interaction of light with a polarizable material on the one hand , and an effective description of such interactions by a permittivity on the other hand .",
    "hopfield proposed that a rather simple model of the light - matter interaction would lead to the permittivity given above , without the need to impose damping by hand or assume a rarified material .",
    "although hopfield s model is simple to state and express as a lagrangian , the derivation of the resulting effective permittivity requires considerable effort and does not appear to have been carried out before .",
    "the aim of this paper is to verify hopfield s conjecture and demonstrate that the formula for @xmath0 above can be derived from a simple , intuitive , classical model of a dielectric .",
    "the initial model considered by hopfield in  @xcite is that of a continuous polarization field linearly coupled to light .",
    "this does not give realistic results however because light is only absorbed at the resonant frequency of the polarization field , giving a permittivity that has a delta function in frequency as its imaginary part  @xcite . the problem with this model",
    "is identified by hopfield as an insufficient density of final states for energy transitions from light into the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "hopfield states that the real reason for absorption of light by materials is nonlinear interaction between the electric dipole moments induced by light and lattice vibrations , so his polarization field would have to be nonlinearly coupled to lattice vibrations in order to see realistic absorption behaviour .",
    "no calculations however are given in  @xcite for such a model with nonlinear matter interactions .",
    "subsequently hopfield s suggestion has been followed up in a quantum setting where excitons ( the quantized polarization field ) are nonlinearly coupled to lattice phonons , the latter providing an effective damping when light interacts with the former  @xcite .",
    "a full analysis in the quantum setting is very challenging whereas an appealing aspect of hopfield s proposal is that it can be carried out classically , much as the textbook motivations  @xcite for the macroscopic maxwell equations are classical . here",
    "we will clarify that the broad absorption of the form used in the standard permittivity expressions can be derived from elementary classical physics .    in hopfield",
    "s scenario the lattice vibrations act as a reservoir into which electromagnetic energy can dissipate .",
    "this subsequently led to another approach in which a phenomenological reservoir consisting of a field of harmonic oscillators at every frequency is _ linearly _ coupled to the polarization field  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological reservoir ( an uncountable continuum of harmonic oscillators ) is meant to mimic the dissipative channel into lattice vibrations through nonlinear interactions proposed by hopfield .",
    "the continuum reservoir , introduced by huttner and barnett  @xcite , allows dissipation and a realistic permittivity to be derived from a linear model but a detailed connection to microscopic physics is less clear .",
    "the continuum reservoir approach has proven to be a powerful tool in incorporating dissipation in a lagrangian with linear coupling .",
    "it has been used to give a lagrangian formulation of the macroscopic maxwell equations for an arbitrary permittivity , without use of a polarization field  @xcite , and similarly to give a lagrangian formulation of damped harmonic oscillators generally  @xcite .",
    "this gives a classical and quantum description of light in all absorbing and dispersive macroscopic media , where the required permittivity ( and magnetic permeability ) are incorporated through coupling functions in the lagrangian .",
    "here we return to the considerations  @xcite that led to the reservoir approach , to further clarify the microscopic processes that allow the macroscopic behaviour to be so accurately captured by a phenomenological reservoir .",
    "we seek to verify that linear coupling of light to electric dipoles which are in turn nonlinearly coupled to lattice vibrations leads to a permittivity well described by the simple textbook formula given above , a permittivity that in particular exhibits the broadband absorption characteristic of real materials .",
    "our analysis will also capture the nonlocal response ( spatial dispersion ) of the material medium , in addition to its temporal dispersion , giving insight into the wavevector dependence of the permittivity of dielectrics .    because hopfield s proposal views the material as a lattice of dipoles , the model considered here is applicable to non - metallic solid dielectrics with a regular lattice .",
    "the model is thus not appropriate for amorphous materials , liquids or gasses , though in practice the permittivity functions of all these states of matter often show similar features .",
    "although our motivation is to elucidate the microscopic physics of natural materials , it is of course possible to construct experimentally a lattice of dipoles on macroscopic scales .",
    "metamaterials based on arrays of dielectric nanoparticles provide an example  @xcite .",
    "such artificial materials are being actively investigated as low - loss alternatives to structures with metallic components  @xcite .",
    "the internal structure of the dielectric nanoparticles , however , is an important aspect of such materials and nothing corresponding to this internal structure is included in our model .",
    "( an important aspect of such dielectric nanoparticles is that the size of the particles can be used to control a magnetic as well as an electric response  @xcite . )",
    "the coupling between the nanoparticles in the array is important but usually this coupling is investigated for its effect in altering the resonance structure of the metamaterial  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the important effect of the dipole coupling in our model is to induce the lattice vibrations that are essential for obtaining broadband absorption in our calculations . on the other hand , in the microwave regime a lattice of dipoles that can vibrate",
    "is feasible in principle and may be useful to explore the absorption and non - local response captured by our model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] we consider a simple 1d microscopic linear model and derive an expression for the permittivity .",

    "[ sec : numerical ] and [ sec : spatial ] .",
    "we initially consider a simple 1d linear model that will prove inadequate to capture the absorption of light by materials .",
    "this will demonstrate why nonlinear interactions need to be incorporated into the model .",
    "consider an infinite chain of polarizable dipoles positioned at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the lattice spacing .",
    "this model can also be considered as the limit of the large but finite chain , described by the same calculations with some small approximations .",

    "this model of a dielectric can be viewed as a discrete version of the hopfield model of a continuous polarization field  @xcite .",

    "we wish our model to produce it from physically motivated interactions , without extreme fine tuning of coupling terms in the lagrangian .",
    "hopfield faced the same problem of infinite absorption at a single resonant frequency in a similar dielectric model @xcite , consisting of the electromagnetic field linearly coupled to a continuous harmonic - oscillator field ( a polarization field , or exciton field in quantum language ) .",

    "this gives a continuum of final states with real transitions as energy absorbed from the electromagnetic field is stored in the indirectly coupled phonons .",
