    "the existence of a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) in leptons , neutrons or neutral atoms is direct evidence for time  reversal ( t ) violation .",
    "because of the cpt theorem , the search for edms can provide us valuable information about sources of cp violation . though a phase in the cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa matrix is enough to account the level of cp violation in kaon and b  meson decays , it can not explain the observed matter / anti  matter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "physics that can ( and new physics at the weak scale more generically ) should produce edms not far from current upper limits .",
    "so far no edms have been observed , but experiments are continually improving . here",
    "we are interested in the conclusions that can be drawn from the measured upper limit @xcite in @xmath0 , a diamagnetic atom .",
    "the largest part of its edm most likely comes from t violation in the nucleus , caused by a t  violating ( and parity  violating ) component of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction .",
    "the atomic edm is generated by the subsequent interaction of the nucleus with the electrons .",
    "that interaction is more subtle than one might think . if the nucleus and electrons were non",
    " relativistic point ",
    "particles interacting solely via electrostatic forces , the electrons would rearrange in response to a nuclear edm to cancel it essentially exactly . fortunately , as was shown by schiff  @xcite , the finite size of the nucleus leads to a residual atomic edm .",
    "it turns out , however , that the relevant nuclear quantity is not the nuclear edm but rather the nuclear `` schiff moment '' @xmath3 which is the nuclear ground ",

    "for the schiff moment to exist , p and t must be violated by the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that whatever its ultimate source , the t violation works its way into a meson  mediated p and t  violating nn interaction generated from a feynman graph containing a meson propagator , the usual strong meson  nn strong vertex and a ( much weaker ) p and t  violating meson  nn vertex .",

    "an accurate calculation is not easy because the schiff moment depends on the interplay of the schiff operator with complicated spin and space  dependent correlations induced by the the two  body interaction @xmath26 . in the early calculation by flambaum , khriplovich and",

    "section iv is a conclusion .",
    "our schiff moment is a close approximation to the expectation value of the schiff operator in the completely self  consistent one  quasiparticle ground state of @xmath0 , constructed from a two  body interaction that includes both a skyrme potential and the p and t  violating potential @xmath26 .",
    "it is an approximation because we do not treat @xmath26 in a completely self consistent way , causing an error that we estimate to be small in the section [ sec : results ] .",
    "in addition , we do not actually carry out the mean  field calculation in @xmath0  itself .",
    "instead , we start from the hf+bcs ground  state of the even  even nucleus @xmath31  and add a neutron in the @xmath32 level .",
    "we then treat the core  polarizing effects of this neutron in the qrpa .",
    "a self  consistent core with qrpa core polarization is completely equivalent to a fully self  consistent odd  a calculation  @xcite .",
    "we omit one part of the qrpa core polarization , again with an estimate showing its contribution to be insignificant .    a good way to keep track of the two interactions and their effects is to formulate the calculation ( and corrections to it ) as a sum of goldstone  like diagrams , following the shell  model effective  operator formalism presented , e.g. , in ref.@xcite . the one difference between our diagrams and he usual `` brandow '' kind is that our fermion lines will represent bcs quasiparticles rather than pure particles or holes .",
