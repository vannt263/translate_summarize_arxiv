    "the instanton approach to qcd ( see refs.@xcite-@xcite for some of the many interesting references ) has played an important role in understanding the origin of the @xmath2 violation in that theory . specifically , t hooft showed @xcite that a new quark term arises which conserves the @xmath3 x @xmath4 symmetry , where @xmath5 denotes the number of relevant low energy quark flavors , but violates @xmath2 . in the case",
    "@xmath5=2 , the @xmath2 violating term is a 2 x 2 determinant of quark bilinears .",
    "if this is generalized to @xmath5=3 , the resulting 3 x 3 determinant has the right transformation properties to explain the unusually high mass as well as the mixing pattern of the puzzling pseudoscalar meson , @xmath1(958 ) .",
    "the relevant calculation is often performed using an  effective low energy \" linear su(3 ) sigma model containing both a pseudoscalar nonet as well as an additional scalar nonet .",
    "such a model gives the usual  precision \" current algebra results for the pion ( and to some extent the kaon ) interactions and an acceptable description of the @xmath1(958 ) .",
    "it also contains information about the scalars although they are often  integrated out \" .",
    "that procedure converts the model to a non - linear sigma model .",
    "it is amusing to note @xcite that in the @xmath5=3 case , the instanton calculation gives not only the determinant type @xmath2 violation term but also another @xmath2 violation term of non - determinant type .",
    "that term will be of interest in the present paper .",
    "we have been studying a generalized linear sigma model @xcite-@xcite containing two chiral nonets which are allowed to mix with each other .",
    "related models for thermodynamic properties of qcd are discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the underlying motivation arises from the increasing liklihood @xcite of the existence of light scalar mesons which show up for instance in the analysis of pion pion scattering data .",
    "note that , at present , the scalars below 1 gev appear to fit into a nonet as : @xmath6&\\approx & 500\\,\\,{\\rm mev } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "i=1/2:\\hskip .7 cm m[\\kappa]&\\approx & 800 \\,\\,{\\rm mev } \\nonumber \\\\ i=0 : m[f_0(980)]&\\approx & 980 \\,\\,{\\rm mev } \\nonumber \\\\ i=1 : m[a_0(980)]&\\approx & 980 \\,\\,{\\rm mev } \\label{scalarnonet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this level ordering is seen to be flipped compared to that of the standard vector meson nonet .",
    "it was pointed out a long time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the level order is automatically flipped when mesons are made of two quarks and two antiquarks instead of a single quark and antiquark .",
    "that argument was given for a diquark- anti diquark structure but is easily seen to also hold for a meson- meson ,  molecule \" type structure which was advocated , at least for a partial nonet , in ref .",
    "thus , on empirical grounds a four quark structure for the light scalars seems plausible .",
    "of course , one expects higher mass scalars related to p wave quark - antiquark composites to also exist .",
    "it is natural to expect mixing between states with the same quantum numbers and there is some phenomenological evidence for this as noted in refs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to construct a generalized linear sigma model containing a chiral  four quark \" nonet as well as the usual chiral  two quark \" nonet .",
    "the study of such a model in fact yields a plausible explanation of the main experimental facts .",
    "of relevance to the instanton physics is that the two nonets are distinguished from each other by having different @xmath2 transformation properties .",
    "furthermore , the treatment of the model in @xcite-@xcite brings in an additional @xmath2 violation term which seems to have the same structure as the additional term arising from the instanton analysis @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we repeat for the reader s convenience , the notation @xcite being used for schematic quark field combinations transforming like chiral nonets with quark , antiquark and various two quark , two antiquark structures .    in section iii , we demonstrate that the schematic molecule type chiral nonet can be written as a linear combination of two diquark , antidiquark type nonets ( which have different su(3 ) color representations for the diquarks ) .",
    "all of these  four quark \" configurations have the same @xmath2 transformation property . here",
    "it will be sufficient to assume that an unspecified  four quark \" configuration is bound .    in section iv",
    ", we give a brief outline of the linear sigma model containing both a  two quark \" chiral nonet and a  four quark \" chiral nonet .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the u(1)@xmath7 violation in such a way that the classical lagrangian mocks up the anomaly exactly .",
    "this leads to ln s of the violation operators .",
    "it has the advantage that the @xmath1 s essentially decouple from the rest of the particles . in order to compare with the instanton analysis",
    ", we thus calculate the leading terms which are linear in the violation operators .    in section",
    "v , we quote the known three flavor effective quark lagrangian arising from the instanton analysis .",
    "we rewrite it using fierz transformations so that the desired ",
    "four quark \" fields become manifest .",
    "they are presented as a linear combination of of a  molecule \" type field and a field made from a color @xmath8 diquark combined with its corresponding anti diquark .    in section",
    "vi , we compare the relative strengths of the two u(1)@xmath7 violation terms as obtained from the instanton analysis to the ones obtained from the generalized linear sigma model .",
    "the linear sigma model relative term strengths are obtained from comparing the properties of the @xmath1(958 ) with those of the apparently best candidate to be its partner , the @xmath9(1475 ) . to convert the quark instanton lagrangian to one involving only mesons we need a way to characterize our ignorance of the quark wave functions inside the meson states .",
    "this is done via a parameter denoted @xmath10 , which is estimated .",
    "section vii contains some concluding remarks .",
    "even though one can not write down the exact qcd wave functions of the low lying mesons it is easy to write down schematic descriptions of how quark fields may combine to give particles with specified transformation properties . for spinor notations we employ the pauli conventions .",

    "this leads to the following schematic form : @xmath30    another possibility is that the four quark states may be bound states of a diquark and an anti - diquark .",
    "there are two choices if the diquark is required to belong to a @xmath8 representation of flavor su(3 ) . in the first case it belongs to a @xmath8 of color and is a spin singlet with the structure , @xmath31 then the matrix @xmath19 has the form : @xmath32 in the second case the diquark belongs to a @xmath33 representation of color and has spin 1 .",

    ". it may be amusing to note that , in the mit bag model approach @xcite to four quark scalars , the relevant eigenstates of the hyperfine splitting hamiltonian also emerge as a linear combination of two diquark - antidiquark configurations .",

    "the model is an upgrading of the single - m su(3 ) linear sigma model to one containing two chiral nonets .",
    "however , it is much more complicated .",
    "for example , the renormalizable version of the present model has ( see appendix a of @xcite and appendix a of @xcite ) twenty one invariant terms in @xmath67 while the renormalizable version of the single - m model has only four terms . to make progress we suggested first including only those terms with no more than a total of eight ( quark plus antiquark ) lines in the underlying schematic interaction .",
    "this led to the predictions(@xcite , @xcite ) : i ) a very light singlet scalar which might be identified with the @xmath68(600 ) , ii ) large four quark content of the lighter scalars , iii ) improved s - wave pion pion isosinglet scattering length .",
    "the model included two @xmath2 violating , but chiral su(3 ) conserving , terms .",
    "these were chosen to mock up the @xmath2 anomaly of qcd .",
    "that is a reasonable requirement in the present context since the @xmath2 symmetry distinguishes the two quark from the four quark mesons .    in the single - m model",
    ", it was noted ( see appendix of @xcite ) even before qcd , that a determinant type u(1)@xmath7 violating piece was needed to explain the @xmath9 mesons .",
    "after qcd , t hooft @xcite showed that a quark level term of the required sort would arise from instanton contributions .",
    "actually , he did not completely present the relevant three flavor version of his model .",
    "other authors @xcite later gave this result and one can see that there is an additional u(1)@xmath7 violation term present .",
    "here we will show that the additional term has the same structure as the one we added on the basis of the quark counting just mentioned .    in the effective lagrangian framework",

    "we have shown that an extra term in the effective instanton generated lagrangian has a natural interpretation as a mixing term between quark - antiquark spin zero mesons and spin zero mesons made from two quarks and two anti - quarks ( in some unspecified combination ) .",

    "the generalized linear sigma model in question is actually a very complicated one , describing many different particles and potentially having many different relevant terms .",

    "from the point of view of truncating the terms of this linear sigma model to a more manageable number we had made @xcite-@xcite a provisional ansatz that terms representing more than eight underlying fermion lines be discarded .",
    "this gave two u(1)@xmath7 violating terms and corresponded nicely to the instanton effective lagrangian , which has two terms with six such lines .",
    "one might ask about going beyond this approximation for an effective model .",
    "if one allows 10 underlying fermion lines , the u(1)@xmath7 violating terms with coefficients @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 in eq.(a1 ) of @xcite are possible .",
    "if one allows 12 underlying fermion lines the terms with coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 kick in . finally , if one allows 14 underlying fermion lines the terms with coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 become possible",
    "this could conceivably also be an interesting expansion in the instanton approach .",
