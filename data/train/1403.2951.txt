    "the study of nonlinear systems is growing since the sixties of the last century @xcite . nowadays",
    "the nonlinearity is found in many areas of the physics , including condensed matter physics , field theory , cosmology and others @xcite-@xcite .",
    "particularly , whenever we have a potential with two or more degenerate minima , one can find different vacua at different portions of the space .",
    "thus , one can find domain walls connecting such regions , and this necessarily leads to the appearance of multi - kink configurations .",
    "some time ago , a. champney and collaborators @xcite made an analysis of the reasons for the appearance of multi - kinks in dispersive nonlinear systems . in part",
    "this was motivated by the discovery by peyrard and kruskal @xcite that a single kink becomes unstable when it moves in a discrete lattice at sufficiently large velocity , whereas multi - kinks are stable .",
    "the effect was shown to be associated with a resonant interaction between the kink and the radiation @xcite , and the resonances were already observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "in fact , in an earlier work by manton and merabet @xcite , it was discussed the mechanism of production of kinks from excitations of the internal mode , in a study of the dynamics of the interaction of two kinks and one anti - kink in a @xmath0 model .",
    "furthermore , in a recent work by m. a. garcia - ustes and j. a. gonzlez @xcite , it is shown that a pair of kinklike solitons is emitted during the process of kink breakup by internal mode instabilities in a sine - gordon model .",
    "the multi - kinks are responsible , for instance , for a mobility hysteresis in a damped driven commensurable chain of atoms @xcite .",
    "moreover in arrays of josephson junctions , instabilities of fast kinks generate bunched fluxon states presenting multi - kink profiles @xcite .    in a different context , by working with space - time dependent field configurations , coleman and collaborators @xcite analyzed the fate of the false vacuum  through a semiclassical analysis of an asymmetric @xmath1-like model .",
    "there , they considered the decaying process of the field configuration from the local to the global vacuum of the model .",
    "moreover , some recent works report fluctuating bouncing solutions @xcite in models presenting local and global minima .    in all the above physical situations",
    "an analytical description of multi - kinks would be very welcome .",
    "however , as far as we know , there is no result in the literature which presents analytical multi - kink profiles beyond the case of two , the so called double - kink @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . here",
    "we intend to fill this gap by presenting a general procedure in order to construct analytical solutions for multi - kinks , considering reasonably smooth field potentials .",
    "in fact , the idea here is to improve another one used previously in some works dealing with the so - called double - quadratic ( dq ) model @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , whose potential is given by    @xmath2    and some of their generalizations like the asymmetrical double - quadratic model ( adq ) @xcite and the generalized asymmetrical double - quadratic model ( gadq ) @xcite .",
    "this last one has the advantage that , having the previous mentioned potentials as their limits , it can be used to study systems in which the curvature of the potential is different in each side of the discontinuity point .",
    "moreover , the vacua of the model can be chosen to represent a kind of slow - roll potential , giving rise to inflaton fields which are important in cosmological inflationary scenarios .",
    "in fact , a similar model was used to study wet surfactant mixtures of oil and water @xcite .",

    "in fact , in this class of potentials one only needs to require that @xmath14 be continuous due to the continuity of the energy density . in figure ( 1 ) we can see the profile of the above potential , as well as its triple - kink configuration .    by following the approach developed in @xcite",

    "for instance , we can get exact analytical solutions for the so called @xmath1 and the sine - gordon models .",

    "now , the continuity condition leads to the following constraint between the coupling constants of the potential @xmath47as in the previous model , this condition is also enough to keep the derivative of the potential continuous . as we are going to see below",
    ", the relation ( [ constantes_2 ] ) is capable to grant the continuity of the field configuration , assuring that the energy of the configuration stays finite .",
    "in this section we develop the solutions and analyze some features of the first model here proposed , the one defined in ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "we are primordially interested in solutions connecting the global vacua of the potential .",
    "these solutions obey the following boundary conditions @xmath48    since we are working with the usual lagrangian density for a self - interacting scalar field , the corresponding equation of motion is @xmath49but , we are looking for the static solutions , which can be boosted in order to recover the traveling ones .",
    "so , the above equation is simplified to @xmath50which can be integrated to @xmath51it must be noticed that the corresponding integration constant was chosen as zero , since we are interested in configurations which go asymptotically to some vacuum of the field potential .    from the equation ( [ first_order ] ) , as usual , we can write @xmath52and from the above one we can conclude that the solution for @xmath53 will be monotonically growing or decreasing according the chosen sign of the right hand side of the equation . on the other hand ,",
    "we are interested in solutions going from the negative vacuum to the positive one , so we will look for a field which increases with @xmath54 .    as we have seen before , @xmath55 is a continuous by parts function , specifically the potential has @xmath56 distinct regions , each one governed by one differential equation coming from ( [ first_order ] ) .",
    "so , in order to identify the solutions and their respective regions we will label them as @xmath57 , with @xmath58 coming from the left to the right .",
    "there is a question which must be carefully treated , and that is the case of the domain of the solutions @xmath53 , since each region in the space of the fields corresponds to another in the coordinate space . in order to become the analysis more precise",
    "we relate each region @xmath59 of the potential @xmath55 to a set @xmath60 such that @xmath61 .",
    "correspondingly to each set @xmath60 we have a set @xmath62 , so that we can associate each element @xmath63 to an element of @xmath64 through the map @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , each set @xmath60 is well determined due to the definition of the potential @xmath55 . however , it is still necessary to determine the sets @xmath62 . for the first region of the potential , @xmath66 ,",
    "the boundary condition ( [ boundary_1 ] ) leads to @xmath67 .",

    "we can write for the intermediary regions of the potential @xmath79 , and the domain of @xmath53 can be defined as @xmath80 and the domain in the coordinate space will be given by @xmath81 .",

    "solutions in the intermediary regions : * let us now deal with the case where @xmath65 . in those regions ,",
    "the differential equations are given by @xmath93^{2},\\]]and , in this case , we need a bit more manipulation before getting the solution .",
    "first of all , we rewrite the equation in the form @xmath94where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . now , making the transformation @xmath98 , it can be rewritten as @xmath99where we used the equation ( [ constantes ] ) and defined @xmath100 . then , integrating it between @xmath101 and @xmath102 we get @xmath103the left - hand side of ( [ int_1 ] ) can be identified with an elliptical integral and , provided that @xmath104 $ ] , it can be solved in terms of jacobi elliptic functions @xcite .",

    "now , using the relation @xmath111 and also the continuity conditions at the junction points , which are given by @xmath112 , it can be  verified that @xmath113 must satisfy the following constraint equation @xmath114it can be verified from above that @xmath113 is independent from the chosen region of the potential , which allow us to use the notation @xmath115 . however , from the equation ( [ delta ] ) we can conclude that @xmath116 can not be univocally determined , since there is an infinite number of solutions for @xmath116 due to the periodicity of the elliptic cosine . on the other hand , despite the fact that the solutions of ( [ delta ] ) are enough to keep the continuity of @xmath53 , not all of them grant the continuity of its derivative at the junction points .",
    "furthermore , it can be numerically observed that half of the roots of ( delta ) lead to continuous @xmath53 , while the other half lead to continuous @xmath117 , and this behavior under the continuity of the solutions is alternate .",
    "fortunately , it can be numerically verified that the first negative root of the equation ( [ delta ] ) is able to grant the continuity of @xmath53 and its derivative .",
    "a further important point is the one related to the determination of the position of the junction points @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , @xmath69 can be arbitrarily chosen due to the translation symmetry inherent to the model",
    ". however , the points @xmath119 , @xmath120 , ... , @xmath118 depend of the choice of @xmath69 .",
    "once more using the boundary conditions at the junction points , we get the constraint relation @xmath121once @xmath69 is specified , we can use the above equation in order to determine @xmath119 .",
    "it can be seen from the above equation that @xmath122 is independent of the region of the potential that is under study , so we can verify that @xmath123by using this last equation , we can still conclude that one can write @xmath124so , given a @xmath69 , the remaining @xmath118 can be computed from the equations ( [ xi1 ] ) and ( 33 ) .",
    "in general we can write the solution of this model in the form @xmath125as it was mentioned above , the parameter @xmath126 controls the height of the local vacua in the model and , as one can verify , when @xmath126 approaches its critical value @xmath127 , the intermediary solutions assume a kink - like profile , and the complete solution behaves like a kind of multi - kink , like a ladder with many steps and this , as far as we know , is new in terms of an analytical configuration . in the limit case",
    "where @xmath128 , we find a configuration where the potential exhibits only global vacua and , as a consequence , the solution connects the adjacent vacua through kink - like configurations .",
    "the field configurations which obey the equation ( first_order ) have their energy density given by @xmath129=\\bigg(\\frac{d\\phi ( x)}{dx}\\bigg)^{2 } , \\label{energy}\\]]and this leads to the following energy density for the present case @xmath129=\\begin{cases } \\lambda ^{2}a^{4}\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(\\lambda a(x - x_{1 } ) ) & \\,\\,;-\\infty < x < x_{1 } \\\\ &   \\\\",

    "now , we will treat the case of the potential ( [ potecial_2 ] ) .",
    "we are again interested in solutions connecting a negative vacuum with a positive one , so that they shall obey the following boundary conditions @xmath150and using the very same argument of the first model , one is lead to conclude that @xmath53 shall be a monotonically increasing function . despite the fact that @xmath55 is written in terms of only three regions",
    ", it will be convenient to divide the axis @xmath78 in @xmath151 regions , each one localized between a local maximum and the next adjacent maxima . in each potential region",
    "we associate a set @xmath60 , and this leads us to@xmath152as it was done in the case of the first model , we associate a set @xmath62 to each @xmath60 , and we get that @xmath65 .",

    "however , the process of solution will be the same in all the intermediary regions , and it will be necessary only to adjust the appropriate boundary conditions in each of them .",
    "first of all , we will work with an even @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", we can rewrite the differential equation ( [ mod_2 ] ) as @xmath166performing the transformation of variable @xmath167 , one can integrate the above equation in the following manner @xmath168where we defined @xmath169 ( with @xmath104 $ ] ) and used the equation ( [ constantes_2 ] ) in order to eliminate the parameter @xmath41 in terms of @xmath170 .",
    "the left - hand side of this last equation represents an elliptic integral , and ( [ elliptic ] ) allows us to write @xmath171where @xmath172 $ ] . on the other hand , by using @xmath155 , it can be shown that @xmath173    at this point we shall be careful , since the field @xmath53 depends on the function @xmath174 which , by its turn , must have its image and dominion very well specified , due its multivalence .",

    "all the above discussion was done for the case with even @xmath24 .",
    "however , the same procedure can be used for the case with odd @xmath24 and the result will have the same appearance , and due to this we will not present the details here .",
    "the energy density of this soliton can also be calculated by using the equation ( [ energy ] ) , and it presents a very similar profile of the one corresponding to the first model , which can be seen in the figure 2 .",
    "in this section we will consider some topological properties for the models proposed in this paper .",
    "it is well know that the usual kink - like configurations are topological solutions and , as a consequence , we may use some index in order to classify such solutions with respect to the topological features .",
    "the so called topological charge is an example of topological index often used in the literature . here",
    ", we show that the topological charge it is well defined for the models presented here , and we will calculate this charge for both models .",
    "+ we have defined a topological current in usual way @xcite , namely @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "it is not difficult to conclude that a conservation law follows from the definition of @xmath188 , in fact we have @xmath189 as a consequence of the antisymmetry of @xmath187 .",
    "note that both the topological charge and its conservation law are well defined , since we have ensured that first and the second derivatives of the scalar fields solutions are continuous at any point .",
    "the topological charge may be defined in terms of @xmath188 in the following way @xmath190 note that @xmath191 , thus , after integration we obtain the following result @xmath192 for the first model considered in this work , whose solution is given by eq .",
    "( [ phi_1 ] ) , we have the asymptotic values for the scalar field given by @xmath193 therefore , the topological charge for the first model is given by @xmath194 it is interesting to note that the topological charge obtained for the usual @xmath0 theory ( which may be obtained with @xmath195 in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) ) is given by @xmath196 , thus , we may rewrite the case with arbitrary @xmath24 as follows @xmath197    repeating the same procedure for the second model , whose solution is given by eq .",
    "( [ phi_2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath198 and @xmath199 . therefore , in this case the topological charge is given by @xmath200 we may note that in both cases the topological charge increases linearly with the number of local vacua as well as with the separation of them .",
    "in this work , we have introduced a method which can be systematically used to obtain analytical multi - kink configurations which come from very smooth stepwise scalar field potentials .",
    "the approach was presented through three examples , and their corresponding typical triple - kink and energy densities profiles can be seen in the figures 2 and 3 .",
    "in fact , as it can be observed from the case studied in the introduction section , these multi - kinks profiles can be constructed in the case of potentials similar to the dq model and its generalizations ( see figure 1 ) . however , those potentials present discontinuity in their derivative at the junction points , which do not happens in the cases we have introduced in this work . among the possible applications of our results , we are presently interested in the possibility of constructing multi - brane - world scenarios ."
