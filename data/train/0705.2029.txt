    "experimental high - energy neutrino astronomy is developing very rapidly .",
    "there exist a number of experiments ( amanda ii  @xcite , rice  @xcite , anita  @xcite , icecube  @xcite , antares  @xcite ) that are currently analyzing or starting to take data . in the future there",
    "are planned projects ( arianna  @xcite , aura , nemo , acorne ) that will benefit from improved detection techniques and larger effective detection volumes .    a guaranteed source of uhe neutrino fluxes are the so - called cosmogenic gzk neutrinos , which are originated by the interactions of extragalactic uhe cosmic ray ( cr ) protons with cmb photons dominantly via @xmath3 processes and subsequent charged pion decays .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos are typically characterized by a spectrum peaking in the @xmath4 ev energy range , depending on the redshift of the cr sources .",
    "ongoing and future experiments expect to detect a few gzk neutrino events ; the precise number depends on the full exposure of the instruments as well as on the production model . direct emission of uhe neutrinos from the cr sources is expected but uncertain .",
    "decays of topological defects or supermassive particles , leftover fossils from the gut era , is speculative .",
    "nevertheless , both mechanisms would produce neutrino fluxes with energies comparable to or higher than those associated to the gzk fluxes .",
    "these neutrinos could interact with @xmath5k cmb neutrinos ( c@xmath6b ) via the standard model ( sm ) reaction @xmath7 , provided that they are extremely energetic ( @xmath8  ev )  @xcite .",
    "we do not explore these speculative neutrino fluxes in the present study .    in this study",
    ", we focus on the depletion of the gzk cosmogenic neutrino fluxes via strongly interacting annihilation processes with _ other neutrino relics _ that also permeate the universe : the diffuse supernova relic neutrinos ( dsn@xmath6 ) , that represent the flux of neutrinos from all supernova explosions that occurred during the universe s history .",
    "the dsn@xmath6 direct detection is still elusive .",
    "the most stringent experimental current limit to the dsn relic @xmath9 flux is @xmath10",
    "@xmath11s@xmath12 at @xmath13 cl , from the superkamiokande experiment  @xcite . the presence of strongly interacting processes , such as the exchange of massive spin-2 particles in theories of large extra - dimensions  @xcite , can modify the @xmath14 annihilation cross section .",
    "this effect would take place at high values of the squared center - of - mass energy @xmath15 , yielding a @xmath14 annihilation cross section that is larger than the cross section for the sm process @xmath16 . in principle , the uhe cosmogenic neutrinos can annihilate with both the c@xmath6b  @xcite and dsn@xmath6 via extra - dimensional enhanced cross sections , which we discuss next .",
    "we consider the following annihilation cross sections for @xmath2 extra dimensions @xcite _ g_kk & = & ( ^2/s ) ( s / m_s^2)^n/2 + 1 + _ f|f & = & ( /60s ) ( s / m_s^2)^n+2 f^2 + _ & = & 3 _ f|f , [ eq : large_x - section ] respectively to produce kk gravitons , fermion- and @xmath17- pairs . here @xmath18 and we use @xmath19 as given in ref .",
    "the `` new physics '' scale @xmath20 is constrained from astrophysical considerations such as star cooling by graviton emission  @xcite and from collider searches  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use @xmath21  tev , 25.5  tev and 2.77  tev for @xmath22 , 3 and 4 , the most stringent current constraints from heating of neutron - stars  @xcite . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the most stringent lower bounds are from the d0 collider experiment at the tevatron , which sets the @xmath24  cl limits for n=5 , 6 and 7 equal to 0.97  tev , 0.9  tev and 0.85  tev , respectively  @xcite . in the @xmath25 scenario ,",
    "the total @xmath14 annihilation cross section is @xmath26  @xmath27 at @xmath28  tev , which roughly corresponds to a @xmath29  ev gzk neutrino interacting with a @xmath30  mev dsn relic antineutrino .",
    "the cross section quoted above is therefore many orders of magnitude larger than the sm cross section @xmath31  @xmath27 at the same @xmath32 and scales as @xmath33 for @xmath25 and @xmath34 .    the neutrino interactions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : large_x - section ] ) are independent of the neutrino flavor .",
    "brane - bulk couplings are flavor blind and consequently the exchange of the kk gravitons is unaffected by the electron , muon or tau nature of the dsn ( anti)neutrinos , except corrections proportional to the squared mass splittings divided by @xmath15 , which are negligible ( @xmath35 )  .",
    "a word of caution is needed here regarding the extra - dimensional scenario , which is an effective theory valid for @xmath36 . at some energy scale @xmath36 ,",
    "this theory is supposed to match onto a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it is not known how to do this matching .",
    "a phenomenological approach is to assume that the neutrino interaction cross sections in the @xmath36 energy range behave similarly to the cross sections in the @xmath37 energy regime , up to some cutoff @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 is presumably somewhere between @xmath20 and @xmath39 , where the latter is the scale at which perturbative unitarity would be violated  @xcite . for the models we consider @xmath39 is always greater than @xmath40 .    within the context of extra - dimensional models ,",
    "the @xmath41 cross sections will be enhanced as well  @xcite , providing a possible explanation for the events above the gzk cut - off as explored in refs .",
    "however , as we will discuss shortly , @xmath42  ev neutrinos would annihilate with dsn@xmath6 on their flight to the earth rather than producing an extended air shower in the atmosphere , via enhanced @xmath41 cross section , in the large extra - dimensional models .",
    "the advantage of exploring the @xmath43 annihilation channel is that extradimensional signatures would occur at lower energy , compared to the signatures in the commonly explored @xmath41 interaction .",
    "a number of authors have predicted the dsn@xmath6 flux . for a recent appraisal of the theoretical and computational status ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . here",
    "we follow closely the derivation given in ref .",
    "a fit to the neutrino spectra from numerical simulations of a sn is  @xcite = ( ) ^ _ e^-(1+_)e_/|e _ , where the average energy @xmath44  mev and @xmath45  mev respectively for @xmath46 and @xmath47 corresponding to all other non - electron anti - neutrino and neutrino flavors .",
    "the spectral indices are @xmath48 and @xmath49 while the total neutrino energies are @xmath50  erg . for @xmath51 ,",
    "we use @xmath52  mev @xcite , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "neutrino conversion inside the star mixes the different neutrino flavors and therefore the relic ( anti ) neutrino flavor spectra at the stellar surface will differ from the original ones .",
    "the final flavor spectra will depend on the neutrino mass ordering ( normal versus inverted ) and the adiabaticity of the transitions in the resonance layers , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete description .",
    "as we will explain further below , the @xmath14 interactions we explore here are flavor blind and therefore the gzk ( anti ) neutrino will interact with the three ( neutrino ) antineutrino flavors . therefore we do not need to account for conversion effects and the relevant quantity would be the total antineutrino ( neutrino ) sn relic neutrino spectra , given by : = + 2 , that is , the sum of the three flavor spectra .",
    "the redshift - dependent sn rate is a fraction @xmath55 of the star formation rate and is given , e.g. sf1 model in ref .",

    "therefore , the uhe neutrino mean - free - path , @xmath66 is many orders of magnitude smaller in the case of the less abundant , but more energetic dsn@xmath6 compared to the c@xmath6b relics .",
    "if the strongly interacting processes deplete the uhe cosmogenic neutrino fluxes , the dominant attenuator will be the dsn@xmath6 targets , which we discuss more quantitatively below .",

    "is greatly enhanced at high energies , and the _ mfp _ for a @xmath29  ev neutrino is @xmath74  mpc in our local universe ( @xmath75 ) , which is less than the gzk radius . even for the @xmath76 extra - dimensional model , the _ mfp _ for the highest energy cr , @xmath77  ev , is @xmath78  mpc which is comparable to the gzk radius .",
    "to explain gzk cr data with uhe neutrinos through enhanced @xmath41 cross section requires @xmath1 .",

    "<S> a direct implication of these extra - dimensional interactions would be the absence of uhe neutrinos in ongoing and future neutrino telescopes . </S>"
