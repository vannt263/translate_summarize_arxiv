    "the solar wind is an extension and a super - sonic expansion of the solar corona into interplanetary space ( @xcite ) .    as in the sun",
    ", we assume that the same behavior of temperature profile takes place in the giant and supergiant stars . this profile must be consistent with grain formation , since the grains can be formed only at low temperatures regions .    in this work",
    "we introduce a temperature profile from a minimum @xmath78 , above the photosphere , similar to the profile obtained by hartmann & avrett ( 1984 ) and a rapidly increase to @xmath79 at @xmath80 .",

    "rodgers and glasshold ( 1991 ) modelled the thermal equilibrium of the alpha ori atmosphere , assuming that heating occurs by grain - gas collisions and by radiation absorption and the cooling occurs by adiabatic expansion and radiative de - excitation .",

    "many authors have tried to explain the mass loss processes of luminous stars like wolf - rayet using only radiation pressure as the accelaration mechanism .",
    "the great problem that arises in this star is called `` the momentum problem '' , that consists of a radiation field momentum lower than the momentum of the wind ( @xcite ) : @xmath85 is in the range @xmath86 ( @xcite ) .",
    "dos santos , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1993 ) presented a model for mass loss in wolf - rayet stars where a flux of alfvn waves acting together with radiation pressure has enough momentum flux and energy flux to drive the wind .",
    "they assumed a plasma without dust and isothermal wind .    in order to verify",
    "if radiation pressure can be important in driving late - type star wind we include the radiation pressure into the wind equation using an effective escape velocity . taking a pure radiative driven wind , the force exerted on a grain of radius @xmath87 situated at a distance @xmath11 from a star of luminosity @xmath88 and mass @xmath89 is :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the mean extinction efficiency factor of the grain , and @xmath92 is the grain radius value .",
    "using the newton s law , the wind equation becomes :    @xmath93    or    @xmath94    where the factor @xmath95 is given by : @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the ratio of the grain number density to the gas mass density .",
    "if we call :    @xmath98    we define the effective escape velocity ..    the escape velocity ( 12 ) is introduced in equation ( 3 ) in the region where the grains may affect the wind dynamics i.e. for @xmath99 ( with @xmath100 ) .",
    "we assume that most of the radiation is absorbed by the grains in this region .",
    "this radiation absorption is partially responsible for grain destruction and acceleration .",
    "these accelerated grains are dynamically connected to gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , so that the grains transfer momentum to the gas inducing the mass loss .",
    "this magnetic - radiation driven winds model consider a steady , cylindrically symmetric and 1-d wind emanating from a divergent magnetic field geometry with a temperature gradient similar to the sun atmosphere .",
    "we assume that a flux of alfvn waves , which properties were defined in earlier sections , are generated near the stellar surface and propagate outward .",
    "since in the inner region of the wind the damping mechanisms already studied in jpo have the same behavior we so use the non - linear one untill the gfp , after that we use the damping length given by eq .",
    "8 . in the region of grain simulation ( @xmath99 )",
    "the radiation pressure in grains , as well as the grain damping , are taken into account from gfp to @xmath101 .",
    "we applied the model to the k5 supergiant , ( model 6 of hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) ) and @xmath1 .",

    "the typical velocity and mass loss rate observed for these stars are of order @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "first we performed some simulations in an isothermal wind in order to evaluate the influence of the grains on the terminal velocities , found by previous pure plasma model .",
    "the introduction of damping by grains has an important effect in decreasing the flux of alfvn waves much more effectively than the others damping mechanisms . as a consequence the terminal velocity of the wind reaches lower values as compared with jpo model .",
    "since the grain formation region is not well known , we introduced the damping by grains at different distances from the stellar surface .",
    "the models show that as closer to the surface the grain if formed , lower is the asymptotic velocity .",
    "this effect is caused by the lose of wave energy by the strong damping , which leaves the wind unsupported against gravity .",
    "decreasing the non - radial expansion factor @xmath33 we can collimate the wave flux into a smaller area accelerating the gas more efficiently . on the other hand , we found that for @xmath114 the presence of grains is not important for the wind dynamics .",
    "the properties of the model can be seen in table 1 .",
    "[ editor place table 1 here ]    the velocity curve obtained by solving the equation of the wind ( 2 ) is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] . for comparison",
    "we plot the velocity profile for a pure plasma and isothermal wind ( dotted line ) , and for the magnetic - radiation model ( solid line ) .",
    "we may note that the terminal velocity for the magnetic - radiation model is higher than the jpo concluding then that the introduction of grain and temperature profile affect the wind dynamics .",
    "the grain presence diminishes the asymptotic velocity , while the introduction of a temperature gradient increases the velocity . for a given density , temperature , magnetic field and gfp ( which are all observable ) we may adjust the model to the expected values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , by varying the alfvn wave flux . the best fit occurs for an initial alfvn wave flux of @xmath117 . on the figure 2 , for a fixed gfp",
    ", we note that the terminal velocity is higher for lower s values due to the consideration of a radiative and non - isothermal atmosphere . in this sense increasing the s value we should have a decrease in the terminal velocity .",
    "however , for higher s values there was no sonic point .",
    "the observations can be reproduced if we increase the initial alfvn flux to @xmath117 . in the figure we mark the region where we assume the formation of grains .",
    "[ editor place figure 2 here ]    although for supergiant stars the momentum problem is not present , it is interesting to estimate the value of @xmath118 .",
    "for example , for k5 supergiant star using the above values we have @xmath119 , lower than 1 , but still high considering normal absorption coefficients . using the above values for the k5 supergiant star , we can estimate the ratio ( @xmath120 ) of the initial energy flux of alfvn waves to the radiation energy flux : @xmath121 .",
    "this value indicates that the energy flux of alfvn waves is only a few percent of the stellar luminosity .",
    "this relation may be used to estimate the alfvn wave flux on other stars like betelgeuse , for example .",
    "betelgeuse observations give the terminal velocity , @xmath122 and a mass loss rate @xmath123 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we applied the magnetic - radiation model to this star with a temperature profile given by rodgers and glasshold ( 1991 ) .",
    "we used the following initial conditions : @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath108 , @xmath129 and the gfp located at @xmath130 .",
    "the alfvn wave flux can be determined by @xmath131 .",

    "as in the previous section , we performed the calculations until @xmath133 .",
    "however , we show in figure 3 the resultant velocity profile until @xmath134 since for @xmath135 the curve becomes flattened showing the same terminal velocity .",
    "[ editor place figure 3 here ]    we obtained @xmath136 and @xmath137 , very similar to the observations .",
    "betelgeuse also has high uv emission at @xmath138 region .",
    "this emission may be connected to the mhd waves damping ( @xcite ) and with a sudden heating of this region , which is in agreement with our model .",
    "in this work we present a model to study mass loss processes in late - type stars , using an alfvn waves flux added to radiation pressure as accelerating mechanisms .",
    "we simulate the presence of grains in the sense of a strong damping of alfvn waves in the region @xmath99 ( which is about @xmath139 ) . in this region",
    "we added the radiation pressure as an acceleration mechanism of the wind . in accordance with grain formation theories and in agreement with observations",
    ", we took into account a temperature profile for the wind going from @xmath78 above the photosphere , with a rapidly grown to @xmath140 at @xmath80 and a decreasing profile for @xmath114 .",
