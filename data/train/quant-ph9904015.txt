    "the figures reveal that the two models can yield decay rates that are quite different from each other .",
    "far from the absorption band of the medium the difference is rather quantitative than qualitative [ figs .",

    "i.e. , in the region between the medium resonance @xmath162 and the longitudinal frequency @xmath163 @xmath13 @xmath164 ( in the figures , @xmath163 @xmath13 @xmath165 ) , a quantitatively and qualitatively different behavior of the two rates can be observed [ figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig5 ] , and [ fig6 ] ] . in particular , the rate obtained with the real cavity model can substantially exceed the rate obtained with the virtual cavity model .",

    "[ fig1 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , and fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .    obviously , an excited atom in an absorbing medium undergoes both radiative and nonradiative damping , and in dense media nonradiative decay can be much faster than radiative one .",
    "in particular , for small cavity radius the @xmath137 dipole - dipole energy transfer terms in the two rates can strongly enhance them .",
    "since the radiationless decay typically happens at the longitudinal frequency @xmath163 , one observes , for sufficiently small values of @xmath166 , a shift of the maximum of the decay rate from @xmath162 to @xmath163 with decreasing value of @xmath24 ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "even when the atomic transition frequency is relatively far from the medium resonance , so that the imaginary part of the permittivity becomes relatively small , the values of the two rates can notably differ from those obtained from eq .",

    "[ 1.4 ] ) or ( [ 1.5 ] ) , because of the @xmath137 near field contributions to the rates .",
    "it should be stressed that eqs .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] )  ( [ 1.5 ] ) apply only when nonradiative decay can be fully excluded from consideration .",
    "otherwise the near - field terms can give rise to observable effects , as is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the rates @xmath135 and @xmath147 differ essentially in the way the cavity radius is introduced .",
    "as already mentioned , in the virtual cavity model the needed coincidence limit of the two spatial arguments of the imaginary part of the green tensor can not be performed , because of the singularity of the green tensor of the ( undisturbed ) medium , and regularization is required . in the paper , a small fictitious distance between two neighboring atomic positions inside a sphere of radius @xmath24",
    "is kept in order to get a finite value , and the result is then averaged with regard to @xmath121 and @xmath122 separately over the sphere .",
    "in contrast , in the real cavity model the limit @xmath167 @xmath9 @xmath63 can be performed exactly and a proper rate can be obtained , @xmath24 being the radius of the real cavity .",
    "> from the above it is suggested that the value of the parameter @xmath24 may be different in the two models in order to fit each other ( note that in the two rates are compared for equal values of @xmath24 ) .",
    "another consequence of the via smoothing introduced radius of the sphere in the virtual cavity model is that there is a non - vanishing @xmath137 longitudinal - field contribution to the decay rate .",
    "hence , the nonradiative dipole - dipole energy transfer from the atom to the surrounding medium is obtained from the interaction of both transverse and longitudinal electromagnetic field components with the atom , @xmath135 @xmath13 @xmath124 @xmath42 @xmath125 . on the contrary",
    ", the real cavity model leads to a decay rate that solely results from the interaction of the atom with the transverse field , @xmath147 @xmath13 @xmath168 . here , the dipole - dipole energy transfer fully corresponds to a second - order process via virtual photons .",
    "it is worth noting that for not too small values of the radius of the virtual cavity ( in our example ,",
    "@xmath24 @xmath160 @xmath169 ) the contribution of @xmath124 to @xmath135 is small , so that it may be disregarded and hence @xmath135 @xmath15 @xmath125 ( see figs .  [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .    equation ( [ 2.17 ] ) defines the total energy relaxation rate of the ( two - level ) atom , which results from both radiative and nonradiative decay , and the question arises of what is the spontaneous emission rate . in @xcite",
    "the transverse contribution to the decay rate is associated with spontaneous emission , whereas the longitudinal contribution is associated with nonradiative decay .",
    "however , the exact result obtained with the real cavity model reveals that there is no longitudinal contribution to the decay rate , and hence the transverse contribution must be associated with both spontaneous emission and nonradiative decay .",
    "similarly , the decay rate obtained from the study of the resonant energy transfer between two guest molecules surrounded by a perfect lattice of absorbing molecules contains only transverse - field contributions and describes both radiative and nonradiative relaxation processes @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is suggested that the spontaneous emission rate be identified with the @xmath24-independent ( far - field ) contribution to the decay rate .",
    "since the @xmath137 near field contribution may be regarded as resulting from nonradiative decay via dipole - dipole energy transfer , the question remains of what is the meaning of the remaining terms .",
    "moreover , from our analysis of , e.g. , the real cavity model it is seen that @xmath24 must not substantially exceed the atomic transition wavelength @xmath157 . otherwise , the markov approximation does not apply and the calculated decay rate becomes unphysical . in order to answer the question of what is really spontaneous emission ,",
    "the model should be extended such that light detection at certain distances from the guest atom is included .",
    "both in the virtual cavity model and the real cavity model the dielectric is described in terms of a continuous polarization field that does not resolve the positions of the microscopic constituents of the medium . in reality",
    "an excited guest atom does of course not interact with a continuous medium , but it `` sees '' the discrete distribution of the microscopic constituents of the medium , at least the nearest - neighbor grouping .",
    "hence a refined treatment of the medium should also allow for the presence in the cavity of nearest - neighboring medium species whose interaction with the guest atom is considered separately .",
    "the enlarged cavity can then be chosen such that the guest atom can not `` resolve '' the discrete structure of the medium outside the cavity and the continuous description applies @xcite .",

    "s. s. likes to thank j. audretsch , f. burgbacher , and k. krutitsky for helpful discussions during his stay at the university of konstanz .",
