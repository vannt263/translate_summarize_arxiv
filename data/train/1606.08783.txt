    "diffuse thermal emission from interstellar dust is an important contributor to galactic foreground emission at millimeter to far - infrared wavelengths .",

    "it is thought to be the dominant contribution to the galactic foreground at frequencies greater than about 100 ghz ( or wavelengths shorter than about 3 millimeters ) .",
    "contributions from free - free emission , synchrotron emission , and anomalous microwave emission become increasingly important at lower frequencies , and the ratio of cmb anisotropy to galactic foreground anisotropy peaks at about 70 or 80 ghz for high galactic latitudes ( bennett et al .",

    "xxii ( 2015 ) found that band - to - band calibration uncertainties limit the accuracy with which any flattening can be measured .",
    "some dust emission models account for the submillimeter / millimeter excess by incorporating a cold dust component ( e.g. , finkbeiner , davis , and schlegel 1999 , meisner and finkbeiner 2015 ) or by using optical properties of amorphous silicate dust adjusted to better match the long wavelength observations ( e.g. , draine and li 2007 , compigne et al .",
    "other possible mechanisms include long wavelength emission due to low energy excitations in the disordered internal structure of amorphous dust grains ( meny et al .",

    "we consider two of the leading physically motivated models , the tls model because it provides a natural explanation for both the long wavelength flattening of the spectrum and the @xmath12 anticorrelation , and the model of finkbeiner , davis , and schlegel 1999 ( hereafter fds ) because it has been widely used for cmb studies .",
    "this model incorporates two dust components with different power - law emissivities that are in equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field .",

    "results of our fits of the tls , fds , mf , and two - graybody models to the galactic dust spectra are shown in figure 3 for a selected region .",
    "for the tls model fit , the dcd process contributes most of the emission above 250 to 300 ghz and hopping relaxation gives the largest contribution at lower frequencies . for the other model fits , the cold dust component gives the largest contribution below about 500 ghz .",

    "there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath34 and @xmath33 , and the hopping relaxation amplitude is proportional to their product .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in this amplitude to be about 17% from fitting the model with a parameterization that uses a hopping relaxation amplitude parameter instead of @xmath34 .",

    "figure 5 shows the fractional residual of the different model fits for each region .",
    "we note that the difference between the 240 @xmath0 m dirbe data points and neighboring firas data points in figures 4 and 5 is mostly due to calibration differences ( fixsen et al .",
    "the dirbe 240 @xmath0 m uncertainty is much larger than the firas uncertainties at nearby wavelengths , so the dirbe 240 @xmath0 m data points have little effect on our fit results .",

    "the two - graybody model gives the best fit because it has the most free parameters for each region .",

    ", the fds model might be expected to be better than the others for fitting dust spectra from data averaged over large sky regions since its use of the 100 @xmath0m/240 @xmath0 m ratio map and the 100 @xmath0 m map allows it to account for variations of dust temperatures and spectrum amplitude on angular scales as small as 1 degree and 6 arcminutes , respectively .",

    "all of its fit parameters are global , while the other models are free to adjust the amplitude and dust temperature(s ) for each region . for the high galactic latitude regions ,",

    "trends with both galactic latitude and ecliptic latitude are present , and are also seen in the latitude profiles from the residual map shown in figure 7 .",
    "the ecliptic latitude dependence is probably due to differences between the firas team zodiacal light subtraction , which is based on interpolation and extrapolation of the kelsall et al .",
    "( 1998 ) zodiacal light model to firas frequencies , and the zodiacal light subtraction used in forming the sfd 100 @xmath0 m map and the fds 100 @xmath0m/240 @xmath0 m ratio map , which is based on fits to dirbe 100 @xmath0 m and 240 @xmath0 m maps using a dirbe 25 @xmath0 m map as a zodiacal light template and an h i map as a galactic dust emission template .",
    "the galactic latitude residual profile is consistent with the corresponding galactic latitude dust emission profile scaled by 2.8% .",
    "this suggests that the galactic latitude dependence may be a result of inconsistency between the sfd 100 @xmath0 m map and the firas data due to differences between the dirbe and firas calibrations .",
    "the factor of 2.8% is within the dirbe 100 @xmath0 m absolute calibration gain uncertainty of 13.5% and is within the range of dirbe - firas 100 @xmath0 m cross - calibration results obtained by fixsen et al .",
    "other possible causes for the galactic latitude dependence include variations in one or more of the model parameters that are taken to be global , or possible systematic errors in the fds 100 @xmath0m/240 @xmath0 m ratio map at high galactic latitudes .",
    "such an error in the ratio map could result from errors in the zero levels of the maps it was formed from , due to error in calibration , cib subtraction , or zodiacal light subtraction .",
    "for example , the 1@xmath129 uncertainty of the 240 @xmath0 m cib from hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which includes calibration and zodiacal light subtraction uncertainties , is about 25% of the mean brightness of the cib subtracted , zodiacal light subtracted 240 @xmath0 m data at the galactic poles .    to see if the fds model can be modified to reduce the fit residuals , we have tried fitting a modified version of the model that uses the sfd 100 @xmath0 m map rescaled by 1.028 and a 100 @xmath0m/240 @xmath0 m ratio map calculated from the _ planck _ team all - sky thermal dust emission model ( planck collaboration 2013 results xi 2014 ) in place of the fds ratio map .",

    "we used the _ planck _",
    "model fit parameters to calculate maps of quoted brightness for the dirbe 100 @xmath0 m and 240 @xmath0 m bands , formed the ratio map , and smoothed it to 1 degree fwhm for use in fitting the modified fds model .",
    "this ratio map has better signal - to - noise ratio than the fds ratio map , and the maps also differ due to differences in zero levels of the input maps and differences in the zodiacal light subtraction for the 240 @xmath0 m band .",
    "the ratio map from the _ planck _ model is systematically larger than the fds ratio map at high galactic latitudes , reflecting the increase of the _ planck _ model dust temperature with latitude .",
    "figure 7 shows that the modified fds model fit leads to improvement in both the galactic latitude profile and the ecliptic latitude profile of the 1200 ghz residual map .",
    "the reduced @xmath13 of the fit is 1.11 , much improved relative to the fds model fit .",
    "this supports the proposition that the fds model shortcomings in reproducing the spatial distribution of dust emission are mostly due to inconsistency between the dirbe and firas calibrations and inconsistency between the zodiacal light subtraction , cib subtraction , and zero - level calibration used for the 100 @xmath0 m and 240 @xmath0 m maps and that used for the firas data .",
    "our fitting does not take into account systematic uncertainties associated with the subtraction of the contributions other than galactic dust emission from the data .",
    "the largest of these uncertainties is in subtraction of the cib .",
    "we have investigated its effect by making fits where we have increased or decreased the amount of cib removed by one sigma at all frequencies .",
    "we used the one sigma cib amplitude uncertainties in the firas channels from fixsen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the uncertainties in the dirbe bands from hauser et al .",
    "the uncertainties are as large as 0.27 mjy sr@xmath47 at 1400 ghz .",
    "fitting for the case where the adopted cib was increased gave significantly poorer fits for the tls and fds models and only slightly poorer fits for the mf and two graybody models , with @xmath125 of 1.71 , 7.82 , 0.95 , and 0.83 for the tls , fds , mf , and two graybody fits , respectively .",
    "fitting for the case where the cib was decreased gave an improved fit for the fds model and slightly poorer fits for the other models , with @xmath125 of 1.06 , 1.60 , 0.93 , and 0.85 for the tls , fds , mf , and two graybody fits , respectively .",
    "in both cases the fds fit is still significantly worse than the tls fit , and the dependence of the fds fit residuals on galactic latitude and ecliptic latitude is similar to that shown in figures 6 and 7 for our original fds fit .",
    "we have assessed the quality of fits of the two - level systems , finkbeiner , davis , and schlegel ( 1999 ) , and meisner and finkbeiner ( 2015 ) models of thermal dust emission to _ cobe_/firas and _ cobe_/dirbe observations of high latitude galactic dust emission from 100 to 3000 ghz .",
    "this is the first side - by - side comparison of these models using a common dataset and a common sky region . for comparison we have also fit a phenomenological model consisting of the sum of two graybody components .",
    "the @xmath13 of the fits show that the fds model is strongly disfavored compared to the other models .",
    "it does not reproduce the spatial distribution of dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths as well as the other models do .",
    "this appears to be mostly due to inconsistency between the dirbe and firas calibrations and inconsistency between the zodiacal light subtraction , cib subtraction , and zero - level calibration used for the 100 @xmath0 m and 240 @xmath0 m maps in the fds model and that used for the firas data .",
    "we found big improvement in @xmath13 for a modified version of the fds model that accounts for the apparent inconsistency between the dirbe and firas calibrations and uses an input 100 @xmath0m/240 @xmath0 m ratio map calculated from the _ planck _ team all - sky thermal dust emission model .",
    "variations of the fit residuals with ecliptic latitude and galactic latitude are significantly reduced . however , the fit is still not quite as good as the fits of the other models , which have freedom to adjust the spectrum amplitude and dust temperature(s ) for each sky region .",
    "the meisner and finkbeiner model and the tls model give acceptable quality fits and remain viable physical models for galactic foreground subtraction in cmb studies .",
