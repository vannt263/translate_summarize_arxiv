    "during the last few years the development of photovoltaic energy has flourished in developing countries with both multi - megawatt power plants and micro installations . however , the scarcity of long - term , reliable solar irradiation data from pyranometers in many of these countries makes it necessary to estimate solar irradiation from other meteorological variables or satellite photographs @xcite . in such cases , models need to be validated via nearby pyranometer records , since they lack spatial generalization .",
    "thus , in some regions in which there are no pyranometers nearby these models are ruled out as an option and irradiation data must be obtained from satellite estimates .",
    "although satellite - derived irradiation databases such as nasa s surface meteorology and solar energy ( sse ) , the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) , inpe , soda and the climate monitoring satellite application facility ( cm saf ) provide wide spatial coverage , only nasa and some cm saf climate data sets give global coverage , albeit at a reduced spatial resolution ( table  [ tab : databases ] ) .",
    ".summary of solar irradiation databases [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the higher mae recorded in station locations in cm saf and _ downscaling without ked _ is also explained in the irradiation maps shown in figures  [ fig : cmsaf ] and  [ fig : ghinoked ] .",
    "the @xmath0 is lowered too far in certain regions of the area studied with _",
    "downscaling without ked _ compared to @xmath1 , which is also shown in figure [ fig : spplot ] .",
    "the intrapixel variability due to the downscaling procedure is indicative of the importance of the topography as an attenuator of solar irrradiation . as a result ,",
    "this zonal variability is higher in pixels with complex topographies and downscaling is more useful .",
    "figure [ fig : diffkedcmsaf ] shows the relative difference between downscaling with ked and cm saf . as might be deduced , cm saf over - estimates ghi in this region by between 11 and 22% .",
    "figures  [ fig : zonal ] and  [ fig : density ] display the standard deviations of the downscaled maps within each cell of the original cm saf raster ( 0.03x0.03@xmath2 ) .",
    "the ` zonal ` function from the ` raster ` library permits this calculation , explaining the intrinsic variability of solar radiation within gross resolution pixels .",
    "consequently , in those pixels with higher standard deviations there will be greater variability .",
    "figure  [ fig : density ] shows how the ked method smooths the deviation within pixels and also the range of solar irradiation in the region ( figures  [ fig : ghinoked ] and  [ fig : ghiked ] ) .",
    "and @xmath3 related to @xmath3,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    ) between downscaling without ked and with ked.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "a methodology for downscaling solar irradiation is described and presented using ` r ` software .",
    "this methodology is useful for increasing the accuracy and spatial resolution of gross resolution satellite - estimates of solar irradiation .",
    "it has been proved that areas whose topography is complex show greater differences with the original gross resolution data as a consequence of horizon blocking and lower sky - view factors , so downscaling is highly recommended in these areas .",
    "_ kriging with external drift _ with the ` gstat ` package has proved very useful in downscaling solar irradiation when on - ground registers are available and an explanatory variable is provided .",
    "this methodology is implemented as an example in the region of la rioja in northern spain , and striking reductions of 25.5% and 27.4% in mae and rmse are obtained compared to the original gross resolution database .",
    "the high repeatability of this methodology and the reduction in errors obtained might be also very useful in the downscaling of meteorological variables other than solar irradiation .",
