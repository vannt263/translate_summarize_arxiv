    ". the reduction of the transition channels is due to the fact that the @xmath182 subbands oscillate between the conduction and valence bands . for the @xmath352 transitions , the significant change to the symmetry of the wave function results in different selection rules , i.e. , @xmath350 . as shown in fig .",
    "10.19(b ) by the thick dashed lines , the absorption peak @xmath366 corresponds to the transitions between two lss of @xmath367 and @xmath368 from the @xmath334 states .",
    "these types of peaks are responsible for the extra peaks in fig .",
    "10.19(a ) , i.e. , the @xmath350 peaks primarily arise from the middle states at lower modulation strength .",
    "the @xmath352 transitions also contribute to the original peaks .",
    "such contributions decline with an increased frequency .",
    "however , the @xmath299 absorption peaks are dominated by both the band - edge and middle states .",
    "the peak intensities from different selection rules change dramatically with respect to the variation in frequency .",
    "the intensities of the @xmath299 peaks gradually rise for a further increase in frequency , while the opposite is true for those of the @xmath350 peaks ( fig .",
    "10.19(c ) ) . within the frequency range of @xmath369 @xmath370 @xmath28 , the former is lower than the latter .",
    "the main reason for this is the fact that the symmetry violation of the wave functions is enhanced for lss with larger @xmath121 s .",
    "it is deduced that the extra absorption peaks of @xmath350 are relatively easily observed for experimental measurements at higher frequencies .",
    "each of them is composed of two peaks , @xmath371 and @xmath372 , which satisfy @xmath212 and @xmath311 with nearly the same frequency .",
    "the absorption spectrum exhibits more features for a higher modulated potential , as shown in fig . 10.20 for @xmath336 at @xmath337 , @xmath373 . in fig .",
    "10.20(a ) , the intensity of the extra peaks becomes comparable to that of the original peaks .",
    "unlike in the lower @xmath98 case ( fig .",
    "10.19(a ) ) , the peak intensities , regardless of their types , vary irregularly with the frequency .",
    "the oscillations of the subband structure are obviously augmented and cause the subband transitions to change greatly with respect to @xmath111 . as a result ,",
    "the absorption peaks grow much wider and split more evenly .",
    "peaks generated by different selection rules are likely to appear , owing to the severe breakdown of the spatial symmetry of the wave functions .",
    "it should be noted that it is difficult to distinguish the original from the extra peaks solely based on the peak heights .",
    "besides the aforementioned spectrum analysis , further discussions are made regarding two specific @xmath111 points . for the @xmath374 transitions ,",

    "10.20(b ) ) . therefore , the initially coinciding peaks split up , and the original intensities are divided into fractions .",
    "moreover , the band - edge states can induce the extra peaks of @xmath212 , e.g. , @xmath379 and @xmath380 . when @xmath381 , the symmetry of the wave functions is destroyed .",
    "consequently , the extra peaks are strengthened , and the original peaks are weakened or even disappear ( thick dashed line in fig .",
    "10.20(b ) ) .",
    "the corruption of the orthogonality of the sublattices @xmath142 and @xmath143 enables the subband transitions to occur from @xmath382 ; such examples are seen in @xmath383 and @xmath384 .",

    "since the symmetry of the wave function does not degrade much , the absorption peaks of @xmath382 no longer exist .",
    "the modulated electric field @xmath393@xmath394 implies that the same value of @xmath395 produces the same modulation effect .",

    "peaks can be developed by the rule @xmath350 ( solid triangles ) . finally , the absorption frequencies related to the @xmath334 states  decrease rapidly with respect to the increment of @xmath98 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the conduction and valence lss at @xmath334 move closer to the fermi level .",

    "moreover , there would exist the dissimilar selection rules for different external fields . in the presence of the uniform magnetic field , the magneto - optical excitations obey the specific selection rule @xmath299 , since the simple relationship exists between the two sublattices of @xmath18- and @xmath19-atoms . as to a modulated magnetic field , an extra selection rule @xmath212",
    "is obtained , due to the complex overlapping behavior from two subenvelope functions in the wave function .",
    "however , the wave functions exhibit irregular behaviors under the modulated electric potential . as a result , it is difficult to single out a particular selection rule . in the composite fields ,",
    "the symmetry of the ll wave functions is broken by the introduce of two kinds of modulation fields , the modulated magnetic and electric fields , a cause resulting in the altered selection rules in the absorption excitations .",
