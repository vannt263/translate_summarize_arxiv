    "the theoretical description of compounds containing partially filled @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 shells is a much - studied problem in solid - state theory . due to the small spatial extent of these shells",
    "the coulomb repulsion between the electrons in the conduction bands formed from these shells becomes unusually strong and approximations which rely on a mapping of the physical electron system onto one of fictious free particles in a suitably constructed effective potential - as is the case in density functional theory@xcite in the local density approximation ( lda ) - can not even qualitatively describe the resulting state .",
    "a frequently cited example are the transition metal ( tm ) oxides nio , coo and mno .",
    "band structure calculations for the paramagnetic phase predict these materials to be metallic while experimentally they remain insulators well above their respective nel temperature . for nio and mno an insulating ground state can be obtained in the framework of band theory by introducing antiferromagnetic order - for coo on the other hand even the antiferromagnetic ground state is metallic@xcite . from a comparison of x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy ( bis ) it was found@xcite that the band gap predicted by lda for antiferromagnetic is too small by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover electron spectroscopy shows that the electronic structure remains essentially unchanged at the nel temperature for both nio@xcite and coo@xcite . in both compounds",
    "there is practically no difference between the electronic spectra in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase .",
    "the same holds true for the related compound nis where lda band structure calculations on the contrary predict that the transition to the magnetically ordered phase is accompanied by a significant change of the electronic structure@xcite .",
    "+ failure to predict the insulating ground state and the magnitude of the insulating gap is not the only shortcoming of lda . in valence band photoemission spectroscopy ( pes )",

    "the fano - like intensity variation with photon energy at the tm @xmath6 threshold identifies this feature as being due to @xmath7 transitions@xcite .",
    "this part of the electronic structure is not at all reproduced by band struture calculations which on the contray would predict the @xmath7 transitions near the valence band top . and",
    "finally experimental band structures measured by angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) show that for all compounds , nio , coo and mno , the tm - derived bands near the valence band top are almost dispersionless@xcite .",
    "this is also in contradition to lda calculations which predicts band widths of around @xmath8 for the tm3d - derived bands . +",
    "starting with the work of hubbard@xcite a variety of theoretical methods have been invented to deal with this problem@xcite .",
    "major progress towards a quantitative description of @xmath1 tm oxides has been made by the cluster method initiated by fujimori and minami@xcite this takes the opposite point of view as compared to band theory , namely to abandon translational invariance and instead treat exactly - by means of atomic multiplet theory@xcite - the coulomb interaction in the @xmath1-shell of a tm - ion in an octahedral ` cage ' of nearest - neighbor oxygen atoms .",
    "the angle - integrated valence band photoemission spectra calculated by this method are in excellent agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "this is clear evidence that the atomic multiplets of the partly filled @xmath1-shell - suitably modified by the crystalline electric field ( cef ) - persist in the solid and play an important part in the physics . on the other hand due to",
    "its ` impurity ' character the cluster method can only give @xmath9-independent quantities .",
    "+ recently , however , ideas have been put forward to broaden the correlated ionization and affinity states of finite clusters into bands@xcite .",
    "a particularly elegant way to do so - the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) - has been proposed by potthoff@xcite .",
    "building on field - theoretical work of luttinger and ward@xcite who showed that the grand canonical potential @xmath10 of an interacting fermion system is stationary with respect to variations of the electronic self - energy @xmath11 , potthoff proposed to generate trial self - energies numerically by exact diagonalization of finite clusters and use them in a variational scheme for @xmath10 .",
    "this amounts to finding the best approximation to the true self - energy of the lattice amongst the subset of ` cluster representable ' ones , i.e. exact self - energies of finite clusters .",
    "+ so far the vca has been applied mainly to simplified systems such as the single - band hubbard - model@xcite but the success of the cluster method for tm - oxides clearly suggests to apply the vca also to a realistic model for tm - oxides thereby using the octahedral clusters introduced by fujimori and minami to generate self - energies .",
    "here we outline such a calculation for nio , coo and mno , which all have the rocksalt structure . for simplicity",
    "we neglect any of the lattice distortions observed in the actual compounds as well as the antiferromagnetic order at low temperature and study the ideal rocksalt structure in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "as already mentioned the single - particle spectra of these compounds do not change appreciably during the nel transition so this is probably a reasonable assumption .",
    "a preliminary study for nio using the vca has been published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "+ using clusters containing just a single tm - ion implies that the self - energy is site - diagonal , i.e. @xmath12-independent .",
    "the corresponding approximation thus is similar to the dynamical mean - field ( dmft ) calculations which have recently been applied to a variety of compounds@xcite .",
    "the relationship between dmft and the vca has been discussed in detail by potthoff@xcite and a detailed comparison with recent dmft calculations for nio will be presented below .",
    "we start by defining the hamiltonian which describes the correlated tmo lattice.we use a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) parameterization of the noninteracting hamiltonian with hybridization integrals obtained from a fit to a lda band structure thereby closely following the procedure outlined by mattheiss@xcite .",

    "this is easily seen from the diagrammatic representation of @xmath30 $ ] because the expression associated with a given feynman diagram involves only the interaction matrix elements and the green s function itself .",

    "the disconneted finite clusters of the reference system then are solved by exact diagonalization , which gives the eigenenergies @xmath44 and wave functions @xmath45 for all particle numbers in the cluster .",
    "of course this sets some limit on the size of the clusters .",

    "this simply means that the summation of infinitely many feynman diagrams and legendre transform is done implicitely in the course of the exact diagonalization of the reference system .",
    "then , the self - energy @xmath48 of the reference system - which is readily extracted from the dyson equation for @xmath46 - can be used as a trial self - energy for the lattice system",

    "we have the physical lattice system plus the decoupled and hence irrelevant ligands and a solution to this system is a solution to the lattice system itself . in this way we can go continuously from an exactly solvable system to the physical lattice system . in practice",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a scan of @xmath10 through the stationary point of @xmath108 along the principal axes so obtained .",
    "there are two important things to recognize .",
    "first , the stationary point is a saddle point but the above crossover procedure had no problems to find it .",
    "second there are certain directions in parameter space where @xmath10 shows only an extremely weak variation .",
    "this turned out to be true in all other cases studied as well .",
    "this weak variation may either stem from a near - invariance of the self - energy under changes of the cluster - parameters or the change of the self - energy is appreciable but irrelevant in that it does not change the lattice @xmath10 .",
    "the presence of such ` nearly invariant lines ' in parameter space clearly is undesirable in that it may induce numerical instabilities .",
    "it may happen that small changes of @xmath10 due to e.g. a slightly wrong lcao band structure or even numerical inaccuracies may drive the stationary point along these lines in parameter space to compensate for them .",
    "scans through the stationary point of @xmath108 .",
    "the normalized eigenvectors @xmath109 of @xmath110 were muliplied by @xmath91 . ]    to simplify matters the number of parameters therefore was reduced .",
    "inspection of the eigenvectors associated with the ` nearly invariant lines ' showed , that these were predominantly combinations of the parameters @xmath111 and @xmath112 in ( [ rewrite ] ) .",
    "these parameters have almost no influence on @xmath10 and hence were not subject to variation .",
    "the parameter @xmath111 was set equal to zero . in the cluster calculation",
    "the value for @xmath112 would be @xmath113@xcite - for simplicity the value @xmath114 was used for all three compounds . + including @xmath111 and @xmath112 into the set of parameters to be optimized actually turned out to give unsatisfactory results for the single particle spectrum .",
    "@xmath111 tended to take on large positive values whereas @xmath112 usually took large _",
    "negative _ values . as a net effect",
    "this produced spurious photoemission peaks with very small spectral weight which were split off by one or two @xmath14 from the remainder of the photoemission spectrum resulting in too small gaps and poor agreement with experiment .",
    "clearly this is a feature of the variational cluster approximation which needs to be clarified .",
    "it should be noted that reducing the number of parameters which are optimized simply amounts to restricting the space of trial self - energies .",
    "since optimization of these parameters hardly changes @xmath10 this is similar to restricting the degrees of freedom in a trial wave - function to the most relevant ones .",
    "it then seems that an ` overoptimization ' of parameters leads to poor results but on the other hand the inclusion of irrelevant degrees of freedom into a variational wave function may also be detrimental for properties of the wave function other than the ground state energy . + finally , nio turned out to be a special case .",
    "since the ground state of @xmath115 in cubic symmetry is @xmath116 the hopping integral @xmath117 has practically no impact on @xmath10 because it connects filled orbitals .",
    "in fact , derivatives of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath117 turned out to be of order @xmath118 , i.e. well beyond the numerical accuracy of the whole procedure .",
    "@xmath117 was therefore kept at @xmath119 which again is the value expected in the cluster calculation . in a previous vca - study of nio@xcite",
    "a different approach was chosen . there",
    "the hopping integral @xmath117 was set set equal to zero .",
    "this implies that the @xmath120-like ligands are irrelevant alltogether and can be discarded from the reference system , so that also the paramaters @xmath121 and @xmath122 play no more role . although slightly different lcao- and racah - parameters were used in this calculation the results obtained in ref .",

    "this is clearly a trivial result but it should be noted that for the discussion of a phase transition to a magnetically or orbitally ordered state the correct description of this entropy is important because this competes with the energy gain due to ordering . + next",

    "are the energies of the poles of the self - energy . ]",
    "lastly we discuss the fine structure of the tm3d derived bands .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig15 ] .",
    "the band structures of all three compounds have a similar structure : at the top of the band structure there is a group of dispersive bands which shows a rough similarity with the upper group of bands in the lda band structure ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , which have mainly tm 3d - character .",
    "the total width of this band complex is reduced by a factor of @xmath179 as compared to lda .",
    "these bands have high spectral weight and produce the intense peaks at the top of the angle - integrated spectra for nio and coo .",
    "separated from this group of dispersive bands there is then a region with many almost dispersionless bands with relatively low spectral weight .",
    "this overall structure can be understood by considering the spectral representation of the self energy ( [ selfrep ] ) and the equation for the poles of the green s function @xmath180 where we have considered the single band case for simplicity . since @xmath181 takes any value between @xmath182 and @xmath183 in between two successive poles @xmath133 and @xmath184 there is one band in between any two successive poles of the self energy .",
    "this implies that the distance between these two successive poles is an upper bound for the width of this band , which may be viewed as a kind of correlation narrowing .",
    "moreover , if a pole @xmath133 has only a small residuum the resulting pole of the green s function will be almost ` pinned ' very close to it - as can be seen repeatedly in figure [ fig15 ] .",
    "the topmost group of relatively strongly dispersive bands then is actually above the topmost pole of @xmath11 in the valence band region and the dominant ` gap opening peak ' in the center of the insulating gap , see figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "since the separation in energy between these peaks is large - of the order of the insulating gap - these bands still have an appreciable width .",
    "the similarity with the lda band structure is due to the fact that the dispersion of these bands is largely due to direct @xmath43-@xmath43-hopping , which remains operative also when the self - energy is included .",
    "while the fine structure of the valence band top is not really resolved experimentally as yet , at least experiment puts a quite low upper limit - @xmath185 along @xmath148 - on the width of the individual bands .",
    "the vca would be consistent with that .",
    "+ the large number of dispersionless bands at more negative binding energy is produced by the large number of densely spaced poles of the self - energy .",
    "these are in turn the consequence of the large number of cef - split multiplet states in the tmo@xmath0 cluster .",
    "interestingly , at least in the case of nio where detailed band mapping is available from arpes , the experimental band structure is quite consistent with this overall structure , namely a group of dispersive bands at the top of the valence band and essentially dispersionless bands at more negative binding energy .",
    "the distance between the dispersive band complex and the dispersionless bands is underestimated somewhat by vca .",
    "+ to conclude we compare the results of the vca for nio with recent lda+dmft calculations@xcite .",
    "@xmath12-integrated @xmath43-like spectral weight obtained by dmft ( top ) ( from ref.@xcite and by vca ( bottom ) compared to xps - data from nio . ]",

    "the dmft - results are taken from yin _",
    "et al._@xcite which have obatined essentially identical results as kunes _ et al._@xcite .",
    "while the @xmath21-integrated spectra look similar at first sight , comparison with the band structure shows that there are major differences . in the dmft spectrum",
    "the top of the valence band is formed by a split off peak @xmath38 with low spectral weight .",
    "this corresponds to the two topmost bands labelled @xmath38 in figure [ fig17 ] .",
    "this form of the density of states is actually reminiscent of the results of the three - body - scattering theory of manghi _",
    "et al._@xcite . in the vca spectrum",
    "the top of the valence band is formed by an intense peak @xmath186 , which corresponds to the topmost band complex @xmath186 in figure [ fig17 ] .",
    "the intense peak @xmath187 in the dmft spectrum on the other hand originates from the band @xmath187 in figure [ fig17 ] .",
    "the dmft bands moreover show a rather obvious correspondence with the lda band structure , resulting in bands with quite strong dispersion .",
    "as already noted the vca differs strongly from lda and shows a larger number of bands , with several of them being practically dispersionless , i.e. corresponding to localized electrons .",
    "+ comparing with experiment , the raw data of shen _",
    "et al._@xcite show no indication for the split off bands @xmath38 with low spectral weight as predicted by dmft . with the exception of the o2p derived bands arpes",
    "moreover shows no indication of the wide bands predicted by dmft - rather there is a number of dispersionless bands as expected on the basis of the vca .",
    "one may say that there are major differences between dmft and vca so that further experiments might resolve this discrepancy .",
    "to summarize , the variational cluster approximation due to potthoff allows to combine the powerful cluster configuration interaction method for transition metal compounds due to fujimori and minami with the field - theoretical work of luttinger and ward to implement a variational scheme for the electronic self - energy and construct an efficient band structure method for strongly correlated electron compounds .",
    "as demonstrated above , a realistic band structure and the full atomic multiplet interaction can be incorporated into the hamiltonian without problems , the system can be studied at arbitrarily low temperatures and the green s function be obtained with arbitrary energy resolution .",
    "the key numerical problem of finding the stationary point of the grand potential thereby can be solved efficiently by a simple crossover procedure .",
    "it has been shown that in the course of varying the self - energy there may exist redundant degrees of freedom which leave the grand potential almost unchanged .",
    "such redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated by simply reducing the numer of parameters in the reference system .",
    "+ the results are quite encouraging in that there is good agreement between the calculated green s function and electron spectroscopies at least to the extent that arpes data are available .",
    "the good agreement also suggests that the band structure of nio , coo and mno is ` coulomb generated ' in that the atomic multiplet structure survives with minor modifications .",
    "all in all the vca appears to be a promising tool for the study of realistic models of correlated electron systems .",
    "the possibility to treat the multiplet and cef - splitting of the various tm3d configurations more or less exactly should make it possible to address magnetic or orbital ordering phenomena in transition metal compounds .",
    "+ i would like to thank m. potthoff for many instructive discussions .",
    "we show that @xmath188 is analytical off the real axis , where @xmath189 can be either the exact greens function of the reference system or the approximate greens function form the vca .",
    "it is sufficient to proove that all eigenvalues of @xmath189 have a nonvanishing imaginary part for @xmath20 not on the real axis .",
    "this is prooved in turn if we show that @xmath190 has a nonvanishing imaginary part for any normalized @xmath191 . for the exact greens",
    "function we have - using the lehman representation - @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 it follows that for @xmath20 in the upper ( lower ) half plane all eigenvalues of @xmath189 have a negative ( positive ) imaginary part and accordingly all eigenvalues of @xmath195 have a positive ( negative ) imaginary part .",
    "the imaginary part could only be zero if all @xmath196 were zero which is unlikely to occur .",
    "a similar proof has been given previously by dzyaloshinskii@xcite .",
    "luttinger has shown that the self - energy @xmath48 has a spectral representation of the form @xmath197 with a real @xmath198@xcite . since @xmath189 is hermitean for real @xmath20",
    "the matrices @xmath199 are hermitean too moreover positive definite .",
    "namely if one of the matrices @xmath199 had a negative eigenvalue @xmath200 then @xmath201 had the eigenvalue @xmath202 plus terms which stay finite as @xmath203 , whereas we have shown that all eigenvalues for @xmath20 in the upper half - plane have positive imaginary parts .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath204 has a positive ( negative ) imaginary part for @xmath20 in the upper ( lower ) half plane which prooves that all eigenvalues of the aproximate greens functions off the real axis have nonvanishing imaginary parts as well .    w. kohn and l. j. sham , phys .",
