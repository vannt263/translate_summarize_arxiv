    "+ the aim of this note is to give a complete proof of the following result : + * theorem*. let @xmath1 be a valued field .",

    "the notion of @xmath0-henselianity is important in the study of fields with definable valuations , and in particular it is important to show that the property of @xmath0-henselianity is an elementary property of valued fields .",
    "the proof we give is elementary , and uses extensively pseudo - convergent sequences and their properties . recall that a sequence @xmath20 indexed by an ordinal @xmath21 is said to be _ pseudo - convergent _ if for all @xmath22 : @xmath23    a pseudo - convergent sequence @xmath24 is called _ algebraic _ if there is a polynomial @xmath25 in @xmath26 $ ] such that @xmath27 ultimately for all @xmath28 , _ i.e _ : @xmath29 otherwise , it is called _",

    "then , if @xmath32 is residual or ramified , @xmath33 is the unique extension of @xmath6 to @xmath34 . _    the fundamental equality of valuation theory ( see @xcite , thm 3.3.3 ) tells us that if @xmath34 is a galois extension of @xmath11 , then @xmath35 = e(l / k)f(l / k)gd\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the ramification index , @xmath37 the residue index , @xmath38 the number of extensions of @xmath6 to @xmath34 and @xmath39 , the defect , is a power of @xmath0 .",

    "the previous observation gives us the result when @xmath47 is not immediate .",
    "let @xmath34 be an immediate galois extension of degree @xmath0 and @xmath48 an extension of @xmath6 to @xmath34 ( hence with the same value group @xmath49 and residue field @xmath50 as @xmath11 ) .",
    "we can write @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "+ step 1 : ( claim ) the set @xmath53 is contained in @xmath54 and has no last element .",

    "hence @xmath69 , and from @xmath70 , we deduce that @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "this shows the claim .",
    "+ step 2 : we extract a strictly well - ordered increasing and cofinal sequence from @xmath73 .",

    "one consequence of lemma 8 in @xcite is that : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ultimate valuation of @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the valuation of @xmath95 for @xmath96 ( which does not depend on @xmath97 as @xmath24 is pseudo - convergent ) .",
    "we write @xmath98 with @xmath99 . then , @xmath100 is ultimately of constant valuation , and we let @xmath101 be this valuation . as @xmath24 has no limit in @xmath11 , it is easy to see that @xmath102 , so that @xmath103 . by lemma 4 in @xcite",
