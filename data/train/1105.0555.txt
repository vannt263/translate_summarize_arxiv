    "it has been suggested that a phase transition would take place from hadronic matter to deconfined quark - gluon matter at sufficiently high density and/or high temperature .",
    "there has been considerable interest in relativistic heavy - ion collisions which could offer the possibility of producing a hot and dense matter and/or plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons . up to now",
    ", experimental data on the phase transition have been extracted from ultrarelativistic collisions of almost isospin - symmetric nuclei , having a proton fraction z / a @xmath1 0.4 - 0.5 , in a region of very small chemical potentials .",
    "these experimental data from ultrarelativistic collisions could provide the possibility of studying the phase transition and testing effective qcd models .",
    "the interest in the transition at high baryon and isospin densities has been recently growing from the possibility of using new heavy ion facilities at intermediate energies and for the interest in the properties of the inner core of neutron stars where the transition to deconfined quark matter can likely occur .",
    "now the main problem is that we do not have fully reliable effective qcd thoeries able to describe the two phases so the main approach has been based of a two - eos model with the gibbs conditions .",
    "in fact this scheme has been widely used to make predictions on the phase transition in the interior of neutron stars  ( e.g. , se the recent @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "we remark that , even in the two - eos approach , only a few papers have studied the phase diagram of hadron - quark transitions at high baryon density in connection to the phenomenology of heavy - ion collision in the ten a gev range ( intermediate energies ) @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the phase transition from hadron to quark matter has been firstly analyzed also for isospin asymmetric matter . in this work , a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model , involving the interaction of baryons with isoscalar scalar and vector fields and with the isovector @xmath2 meson and pion field , was used for hadronic matter and a mit - bag model involving massless u and d quarks was adopted for quark matter .",
    "more recently , refs.@xcite , the rmf approach was extended to the isovector - scalar @xmath3-field to study symmetry energy effects on the possible formation of a mixed hadron - quark phase at high baryon density during intermediate energy collisions between neutron - rich heavy ions .",
    "we remind that the nonlinear walecka model ( @xmath4 ) @xcite based on the @xmath5 effective theory , has been extensively applied to study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron star , stable nuclei and then extended to the drip - line regions . in the last years",
    "some authors @xcite have stressed the importance of including the @xmath6 field in hadronic effective field theories for asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the role of the @xmath3 meson in isospin channels appears relevant at high density regions @xcite and so of great interest in nuclear astrophysics .    in order to describe the medium dependence of nuclear interactions , a density dependent relativistic hadron ( @xmath7 ) field theory",
    "has been also suggested @xcite .",
    "the density dependent meson - nucleon couplings are based on microscopic dirac - brueckner ( @xmath8 ) calculations @xcite and adjusted to reproduce some nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties @xcite . recently the density dependent coupling models have been applied to the neutron stars @xcite . in this paper , we use the constant coupling ( nl - rmf ) scheme and the ddrh model for hadronic matter and the mit bag model for quark matter .",
    "we study the phase transition of hadronic to quark matter and in particular the dependence of the boundaries of the mixed hadron - quark coexistence phase on the choice of the bag pressure .",
    "our study leads to the appearance of a critical - end - point of the mixed phase for low values of the bag parameter .",
    "moreover recently a similar effect due to a density variation of an effective bag constant has been observed using a nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) model , with dynamical varying masses for the quark phase @xcite .",
    "we also want to see the effects of the different hadronic models on boundaries of the mixed phase .",
    "we find that the critical temperature at low chemical potential is almost not affected by variation of the hadron eos and the bag - constant dependence can be well reproduced by a naive ultrarelativistic massless quark gas model .",
    "conversely the critical chemical potential at vanishing temperature is very sensitive to the eos of the hadronic part .",
    "furthermore the mixed phase structure at high baryon density is affected by the hadron eos , especially in isospin asymmetric matter .",
    "this has been observed when the isovector - scalar @xmath3 meson is included and when some density dependence of the isovector meson couplings are introduced .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in order to give more emphasis on the new obtained results we report in the appendices all the details about the effective equation of state adopted in the two sectors : in appendix a both models used for hadronic matter are described while in appendix b we introduce the mit - bag model at finite temperature for quark matter .",
    "the gibbs phase transition conditions are presented in sect.2 .",
    "the results are shown and discussed in sect.3 .",
    "sect.4 is devoted to a detailed analysis of the bag constant dependence of critical end points in temperature and chemical potential .",
    "finally some conclusions are drawn in sect.5 .",
    "according to the gibbs conditions for phase transition , the temperatures , the chemical potentials , and pressures of hadronic matter have to be identical to that of quark matter inside the mixed phase .",
    "moreover we must require the conservation of the total baryon and isospin densities :    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the fraction of quark matter in the mixed phase .",

    "we will refer to these different iso - lagrangians as : i ) @xmath19 , where no isovector meson is included and the symmetry term is only given by the kinetic fermi contribution , ii ) @xmath20 when the interaction contribution of an isovector - vector meson is considered and finally iii ) @xmath21 where also the contribution of an isovector - scalar meson is accounted for .",
    "see details in appendix a1 .",
    "we are well aware that there are several uncertainties on the stiffness of the symmetry energy at high baryon density , mainly due to the lack of suitable data , see the reviews @xcite .",
    "therefore we will show also results with effective hadron interactions based on rmf models with density dependent meson - nucleon couplings ( @xmath7 forces , appendix a2 ) that present much softer symmetry terms at high baryon density .",
    "as already mentioned , in the quark phase we use the mit - bag model , appendix b , where the symmetry term is only given by the fermi contribution .",
