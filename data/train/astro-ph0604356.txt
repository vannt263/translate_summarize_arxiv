    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is currently one of the most powerful tools of cosmology .",
    "its study provides us with essential information about the origin and evolution of the universe .",
    "in particular , a key issue is whether the cmb temperature fluctuations follow a gaussian distribution , as predicted by the standard inflationary model .",
    "a detection of intrinsic non - gaussianity in the cmb would be a hint of new physics ( see  @xcite or  @xcite and references therein ) and therefore would have far reaching consequences on our current knowledge of the universe . in addition secondary anisotropies ( such as the sunyaev - zeldovich effects , or the rees - sciama effect ) , contaminant astrophysical emissions ( coming from galactic and extragalactic foregrounds ) and systematics can also leave non - gaussian imprints in the observed microwave sky . therefore , it is crucial to perform a careful study of any possible detected non - gaussianity in order to understand its origin .    in the last years",
    "there has been a large number of experiments measuring the cmb anisotropies and polarization ( dasi ,  @xcite ; vsa ,  @xcite ; cbi ,  @xcite ; acbar ,  @xcite ; archeops ,  @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the nasa wmap satellite has provided with high quality observations of the whole sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "many works have studied the gaussianity of the wmap data , including the use of wavelet tools ( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) , harmonic techniques ( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , and real space analyses ( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , finding in some cases deviations from gaussianity whose origin is uncertain . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the study of the gaussianity of the cmb using a set of scalar quantities of the temperature field , such as the laplacian , the shape index or the gaussian curvature .",
    "previous works on related methods include the study of maxima properties ( @xcite ,   @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , the fraction of lake and hill points ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) or the skeleton lenght ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "some previous works have also compared the performance of different statistics to detect non - gaussianity in the cmb using a reference set of non - gaussian simulations .",
    "for instance , @xcite compared the capability of wavelet techniques and minkowski functionals as non - gaussianity detectors using simulated maps of the kaiser - stebbins effect .",
    "the comparative performance of the spherical haar wavelet and the spherical mexican hat wavelet has been tested on non - gaussian simulations generated through the edgeworth expansion @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the relative performance of wavelet and fourier based methods by applying them to three different sets of non - gaussian maps that were representative of possible non - gaussian signatures present in the cmb .",
    "three different approaches in pixel , harmonic and wavelet space were tested by @xcite on simulations of the quadratic potential model and on gaussian maps contaminated by point sources . @xcite",
    "have compared theoretically and experimentally the performance of the kurtosis to the higher criticism and max statistics in the wavelet and curvelet spaces .    in a previous work ,",
    "@xcite ( hereafter m05 ) studied the probability distribution of a series of scalar quantities assuming that the cmb is a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian field and including also the effect of anisotropic noise and the presence of a mask .",
    "these quantities were proposed as promising tools for the analysis of the temperature distribution of the cmb . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the performance of these scalars ( as well as three new ones ) to detect non - gaussianity in the cmb .",
    "in particular , we have tested the method using non - gaussian simulations with skewness and kurtosis injected through the edgeworth expansion ( @xcite ) .",
    "although edgeworth simulations do not correspond to a realistic model , it is expected that physical motivated models , as well as contaminant emissions , will introduce a certain level of skewness and/or kurtosis in the cmb distribution . as an example",
    ", the quadratic potential model would introduce skewness in the cmb ( @xcite ) , the cosmic strings would generate kurtosis ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) whereas residual point sources would introduce both ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the use of non - gaussian simulations constructed through the edgeworth expansion , where a certain level of skewness or kurtosis is injected , provides us with an interesting tool in order to test the type of deviations from gaussianity that one would expect in realistic data .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    "in @xmath02 we briefly summarise the work of m05 , describing the different considered scalars ( including three new quantities ) and presenting some theoretical results for the case of a gaussian field .",
    "our simulations are described in @xmath03 whereas @xmath04 presents the results of our gaussianity test .",
    "section @xmath05 summarises our main conclusiones .",
    "finally , we include a series of appendices with the description of the three new quantities as well as analytical expressions for the cumulative functions of some of the considered scalars .",
    "the temperature anisotropies of the cmb are usually described as a 2-dimensional field t@xmath1 on the sphere .",
    "the first and second derivatives of the field encode very interesting information about the fluctuations .",
    "in particular , different quantities which are scalars under a change of the coordinate system ( i.e. regular general transformation @xmath2 can be constructed from the first and second covariant derivatives of the field , which can be useful to perform gaussian studies of the cmb . since a field can deviate from gaussianity in an infinite number of ways ,",
    "it is a non - trivial task to design a unique set of scalars that is optimal to detect any possible type of non - gaussianity . therefore our aim is to study the performance of a ( relatively large ) number of scalars to detect some generic types of non - gaussianity ( non - zero skewness and kurtosis ) . in particular",
    ", m05 studied the probability density function of different scalars for a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian field . in this section",
    "we briefly describe these quantities ( for a more detailed description , see m05 ) and introduce three new scalars ( curvedness , fractional isotropy and fractional anisotropy ) .    using first derivatives we can construct the square of the modulus of the gradient @xmath3 , which provides information on how the temperature varies spatially , and",
    "is given by : @xmath4 other scalars can be constructed using only second derivatives .",
    "these scalars are directly related to the eigenvalues @xmath5 of the negative hessian matrix of the field , @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "in particular the eigenvalues can be written as a function of the covariant second derivatives in the following way : @xmath7\\ ] ] @xmath8 ~,\\ ] ] combining these three quantities , we can construct other scalars that enhance different features or properties of the analysed temperature field .",
    "an interesting scalar is given by the trace of the hessian matrix ( the laplacian ) @xmath9 : @xmath10 the distortion @xmath11 and the shear @xmath12 are related to the difference between eigenvalues : @xmath13 @xmath14 while these scalars describe the asymmetry of the field through the difference of the eigenvalues , other scalars express a similar information using their ratio .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath15 and its bounded construction the shape index @xmath16 are dimensionless scalars given by : @xmath17 @xmath18 other scalars , related to the curvature of the field , are the determinant @xmath19 of the hessian matrix , the gaussian curvature @xmath20 and the curvedness @xmath21 ( see appendix [ ap : curvedness_ap ] ) : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 we can also construct new scalars by combining two of the previous scalars .",
    "examples of these are the fractional isotropy @xmath25 and the fractional anisotropy @xmath26 , which correspond , respectively , to the laplacian and the distortion weighted by the curvedness ( see appendices [ ap : frac_aniso_ap ] and [ ap : frac_iso_ap ] ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 finally , we have also considered the derivative of the square of the gradient modulus , @xmath29 : @xmath30 assuming that t@xmath1 is a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random field , we can derive analytical or semi - analytical expressions for the probability density function ( pdf ) of the previous scalars ( see m05 and appendices [ ap : curvedness_ap ] to [ ap : frac_iso_ap ] ) . in this case",
    ", the pdf of the different scalars is completely determined by the power spectrum , @xmath31 of the original field t. this dependence appears in the distribution function of the scalars through the moments of the initial field , @xmath32 : @xmath33^{i } ~. \\label{eq : momentos}\\ ] ] however , as shown in m05 , it is possible to remove the dependence of the pdf of the scalars on the power spectrum of the field by constructing new quantities that we have called _ normalised scalars_. therefore , for the gaussian case , a given normalised scalar will have the same distribution function independently of the power spectrum of the field .",
    "the definitions of the normalised scalars  as a function of the ordinary scalars  as well as their pdf s for a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian field are given in table [ tab : norm_scalars ] ( for completeness we also include the normalised temperature in the table ) .",
    "in addition to its greater simplicity , these new quantities allow us to deal in a straightforward way with the presence of anisotropic noise ( see below ) ."
