    "the partition function of a rational conformal field theory ( rcft ) on a torus is subjected to modular invariance constraints .",
    "these constraints turn out to be very strong , and have led to the classification of families of models .",
    "the most celebrated achievement is the ade classification of @xmath4 wess  zumino  novikov  witten models @xcite .",
    "its relationship with the classification of simply  laced lie algebras , a one  to  one correspondence , is an _ a posteriori _ observation .",
    "two very different problems lead to the same classification pattern , but the proofs have very little in common .",
    "this remarkable coincidence sustained the hope that rcfts , combined with the requirement of modular invariance , could perhaps be organized by known mathematical structures , thereby bringing order in the so  called conformal zoo , and possibly much deeper connections with seemingly unrelated problems . at the moment however , such general connections remain very uncertain . even in the case of the @xmath4 models ,",
    "a deep reason behind the ade correspondence has remained elusive .",
    "the few other families of theories classified up to now are either closely related to ade , or clearly related to arithmetical peculiarities , which look like mere facts , and for that reason , are not understood .",
    "the classification of @xmath0 modular invariants , due to gannon @xcite , belongs to this second class .",
    "but even if a clear interpretation of the result is lacking , the work on @xmath0 has led to fundamental progress in our understanding of general methods to address the problem of modular invariance . in particular a very powerful ( but weaker than the full modular invariance ) selection rule , called the parity rule , has emerged .",
    "first defined in a restricted context @xcite , it has now been shown to hold in any rational conformal field theory as an application of galois theory @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , thiran , weyers and one of the authors @xcite observed that the parity rule for @xmath0 appears in a totally different context , as an isomorphism criterion for abelian varieties that build up the decomposition of the jacobian of fermat curves in simple factors . in this case , existing mathematical results about fermat curves apply directly to the problem of modular invariance , and the work of koblitz and rohrlich @xcite was used to classify the modular invariants when the height ( to be defined in section 2 ) is prime to 6 @xcite .",
    "our first aim in this paper is to explore this connection in more detail .",
    "in particular , we shall show that @xmath0 conformal field theories and fermat curves have striking similarities that might go beyond the above observation , but they have important differences as well . also , quite unexpectedly , the problem of rational triangular billiards @xcite is naturally related to the parity rule and to modular invariants .",
    "we will present a certain number of `` strange coincidences '' , relating in a curious way the three topics we discuss in this article , namely the @xmath0 models , the complex fermat curves and the triangular billiards .",
    "these observations take place at various levels , but as intriguing as they may be , they remain obscure . in fact",
    "the obvious observation that conformal field theories are often organized in families ( indexed by the level for wess  zumino  novikov  witten models , or the degree of fermat curves for instance ) is the starting point for other puzzling remarks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the second section is a general reminder of conformal theories with an affine lie algebra , which we take to be @xmath0 for definiteness .",
    "the material is not new , but presented in such a way as to emphasize the links with fermat curves .",
    "this section contains a short review on the modular group and the modular invariance problem , and recalls the parity selection rule .",
    "we also prove some character identities related to lattice summations .",
    "section 3 is an introduction for non  experts to the geometry of complex fermat curves and their jacobians .",
    "complex multiplication in abelian varieties is briefly discussed .",
    "again there is no claim to originality .",
    "we present the criterion of shimura  taniyama to study the isogeny classes of abelian varieties and we show its equivalence with the parity rule for @xmath0 .    in the fourth section ,",
    "we start with a short introduction to the notion of `` dessins denfants '' ( see for instance the collective contribution @xcite ) .",
    "they give a convenient framework to discuss combinatorial and analytic aspects of certain ( special , but ubiquitous for the objects we study ) ramified coverings between riemann surfaces .",
    "this general discussion puts on the same footing fermat curves and their holomorphic differentials , rational triangular billiards and some aspects of their trajectories .",
    "we then attempt to make a list of similarities between @xmath0 affine characters and holomorphic differentials on fermat curves .",
    "in particular we show that the identity block of the exceptional modular invariants for @xmath0 is encoded in a sequence of rational maps between the degree 24 fermat curve and algebraic curves associated with rational triangular billiards .",
    "we also show that holomorphic differentials on fermat curves can be reinterpreted , via uniformisation theory , as modular forms that share some of the properties of the @xmath0 characters , and for which we solve the modular problem .",
    "finally we explore in section 5 the algebraic consequences of the fact that the genus one characters of an arbitrary rational conformal field theory are automorphic functions for a finite index subgroup of the modular group . we prove that the characters are all algebraic over @xmath5 , a property that allows to associate a well  defined riemann surface with any rational conformal field theory ( or with any chiral algebra ) .",
    "we study some general features of the riemann surfaces arising in this way , and show how they can be computed in actual cases .",
    "this is illustrated by determining the surface associated to the @xmath0 , level 1 ( @xmath0 , level 2 , is relegated to a separate appendix ) .",
    "there are two appendices containing technicalities and computational details .",
    "claude itzykson s premature death is a tragedy for his friends and collaborators .",
    "this article tries to address questions that were raised more than three years ago and claude participated very actively to the early stages of this work .",
    "he not only did actual computations ( the link between billiards and blocks of modular invariants is only one of those ) , but he also pointed out some possible hidden facets of the problem .",
    "we tried to put his ideas in a form as close as possible to claude s standards .",
    "anyway , it is fair to say that he should be credited for most of the ideas while the other authors should be blamed for the inaccuracies .",
    "we miss him very much .",
    "we review in this first section the basic features of affine lie algebras and the problem of modular invariance .",
    "we will mainly consider the so  called untwisted @xmath0 affine lie algebra , but most of the material presented here has straightforward generalizations to other algebras @xcite .",
    "the wess  zumino  novikov ",
    "witten ( wznw ) models are rational conformal theories which describe two  dimensional massless physical systems possessing an affine lie algebra as dynamical current symmetry @xcite .",
    "the building block for the chiral algebra pertaining to the @xmath0based models is the current algebra known as @xmath6 = [ x , y]_l+m + kl_l+m,0x , y , x , y su(3 ) , l , m .",

    "an appropriate completion of the envelopping algebra of ( [ aff ] ) contains a central extension of the conformal algebra with central charge @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the dual coxeter number of @xmath0 and @xmath15 is called the height .",
    "if we write @xmath16 , the virasoro algebra is generated by the density @xmath17 for a suitable choice of the constant @xmath18 .",

    "the hilbert space @xmath21 of the theory is the direct sum of highest weight @xmath10modules : = _ p , p n_p , pr_p _ p , [ hilbert ] with @xmath22 giving the multiplicities . if one requires that the representations @xmath23 be unitary , as appropriate in the case of wznw models which are unitary field theories , the level hence the height must be a positive integer ( implying @xmath24 ) , and only a finite number of representations are possible .",
    "they are labeled by strictly ( _ i.e. _ shifted ) dominant @xmath0 weights @xmath25 whose dynkin labels satisfy @xmath26 . for what follows ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce a third label @xmath27 , which can be interpreted as the zero  th label corresponding to the extra affine fundamental weight @xcite , and define the alcve as the set of triplets ( or affine weights ) b_n = \\{p=(r , s , t ) : r , s , t 1 r+s+t = n } .",
    "@xmath28 consists of the portion of the @xmath0 weight lattice that lies in the interior of the region delimited by the three lines ( affine walls ) @xmath29 ( @xmath30 are the two simple roots and @xmath31 is the highest root ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath28 is a fundamental domain for the action of the affine weyl group @xmath32 on elements of the weight lattice with trivial little group .",
    "its cardinality is @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to being graded by a cartan subalgebra of @xmath0 , which is the reason why we could label the affine representations ( and all their states ) by weights , all modules @xmath23 are graded by @xmath34 .",

    "it is amusing to note that the above relation for @xmath82 and @xmath84 is precisely the one moore and seiberg used to discover the exceptional @xmath0 modular invariant at height @xmath86 @xcite , namely _ ( 2,2,8 ) + _ ( 2,8,2 ) + _ ( 8,2,2 ) - _ ( 4,4,4 ) = 8 .      besides their group",
    "theoretical importance , the characters are intimately related to the partition function of physical models on riemann surfaces .",
    "the simplest and by now classical case , namely tori , has been first considered in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the partition function of a rational conformal field theory put on a torus @xmath87 of modulus @xmath88 , has the general form z ( ) = tr_h(q^l_0-c/24 q^l_0-c/24 ) , where the complex number @xmath49 is related to the modulus of the torus by @xmath89 .",
    "the trace is taken over the hilbert space of the model , and @xmath90 is the complex conjugate of @xmath49 . in virtue of the decomposition ( [ hilbert ] ) it is completely general , just insert the representations of whatever the symmetry algebra @xmath10 is , one obtains z ( ) = _ p , p n_p , p_p(q ) _ p(q ) . [ partition ]",
    "the problem of modular invariance stems from the fact that a same torus may be given in terms of a whole class of moduli , namely all @xmath88 related by @xmath91 transformations , also known as modular transformations , in fact specify a single torus .",
    "which representative one chooses in this class should not affect the physical partition function , and as a consequence , it must be modular invariant , @xmath92 .",
    "it is actually sufficient to check the invariance of the partition function under @xmath93 and @xmath94 , since together they generate the whole of @xmath95 .",
    "this is what the modular invariance ( on the torus ) requires : to check that the partition function satisfies z ( ) = z(+ 1 ) = z(-1 ) .",
    "but in fact this argument can be turned around . since the partition function must have the general form ( [ partition ] ) , the modular invariance constrains the choice of the integers @xmath96 , and hence the model itself .",
    "this is how the criterion of modular invariance led to the possibility of classifying the consistent ( candidates of ) conformal theories .",
    "it turns out that the modular invariance is a fantastically strong constraint , as very few choices of integers @xmath96 lead to modular invariant partition functions . in the first case for which the classification has been carried out , namely @xmath97 ,",
    "unexpected connections emerged with other mathematical areas .",
    "indeed the results showed that the list of @xmath4 modular invariants is isomorphic to the list of simply  laced simple complex lie algebras ade ( or equivalently to the list of finite subgroups of @xmath98 ) @xcite .",
    "this surprising correspondence has remained largely mysterious ( see @xcite however ) , but prompted further investigations . as far as affine lie algebras are concerned , the next case is @xmath99 . here",
    "too the complete list is known for all levels @xcite , but it shows no obvious pattern . an attempt to link the structure of modular invariants ( for @xmath0 and more general cases ) to graphs has been made in @xcite .",
    "based on technical similarities , another connection was suggested in @xcite , which relates the affine @xmath0 modular problem to the geometry of the complex fermat curves .",
    "this connection is precisely the problem we want to address in this article .",
    "it would probably be inspiring to see the solution to the modular problem for higher rank affine simple lie algebras , but no complete list is known beyond rank 2 .",
    "partial results for affine algebras include : all simple algebras at level 1 @xcite , all @xmath100 algebras at level 2 and 3 @xcite , products of @xmath4 factors with the restriction @xmath101 ( except for a product of two factors for which the classification is complete ) @xcite .",
    "other approaches to the classification problem have produced complete lists of modular invariants of specific types @xcite .",
    "one may check the modular invariance of @xmath102 by looking at the way the affine characters transform @xcite . from the general form ( [ char ] ) of the characters ,",
    "the transformation under @xmath103 is easy to compute , while that under @xmath104 can be obtained from the poisson formula .",
    "the results show that the characters @xmath44 , for @xmath105 , transform linearly under a modular transformation , @xmath106 for @xmath107 in @xmath91 .",

    "the two matrices are symmetric and unitary , and satisfy @xmath110 with @xmath111 the charge conjugation , so that @xmath104 and @xmath103 generate a representation of @xmath112 rather than @xmath91 .",

    "one can also show that for @xmath114 , no power @xmath115 for @xmath116 has all its eigenvalues equal because this would mean that @xmath117 are equal modulo @xmath118 , which implies that @xmath118 divides @xmath119 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath120 is central for @xmath121 .    inserting the modular transformations of the characters into the partition function ,",
    "one finds that @xmath102 is modular invariant iff the matrix @xmath96 satisfies @xmath122 , or , by using the unitarity of @xmath104 and @xmath103 , iff @xmath123 is in the commutant of the representation of @xmath91 carried by the characters is trivial . ]",

    "the commutant of @xmath104 and @xmath103 , without imposing the positivity condition @xmath124 , has been worked out in full generality for the affine lie algebras of the @xmath100series @xcite , but the results extend trivially to all algebras .",
    "it was found that the commutant over @xmath125 actually has a basis of matrices with coefficients in @xmath57 , and also that this commutant is rather big .",
    "its dimension is an arithmetic function , growing roughly like @xmath126 for @xmath100 at level @xmath127 @xcite . in view of the fact that so few modular invariant partition functions satisfy it",
    ", it shows that the positivity condition is really the crucial one , and also the most difficult to handle .",
    "recent developments have shown that the most efficient way of dealing simultaneously with the commutation and with the positivity conditions is to use galois theory techniques , which beautifully combine the algebraic nature of @xmath104 with the rational character of @xmath96 .",
    "before we review these aspects in the next section , we mention a last feature of the modular matrices @xmath104 and @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath56 is coprime with 3 , @xmath104 and @xmath103 have a property which is useful in actual calculations , namely they can be written as tensor products . from the above formulas , one may check that under the cyclic rotation @xmath128 , an automorphism of the extended dynkin diagram of @xmath0 , one has , for @xmath129 t_(p),(p ) = ^n - r-2s t_p , p , s_p,(p ) = ^r+2s s_p , p. the quantity @xmath130 taken modulo 3 is the triality of @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath56 and 3 are coprime , @xmath131 acts on the weights of @xmath28 without fixed points . thus if one splits @xmath28 into orbits under the action of @xmath131 by writing @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 of zero triality , one obtains t_^k(r),^k(r ) = ( ^k^2n_k , k ) t_r , r,s_^k(r),^k(r ) = ^nkk s_r , r. the same property holds in @xmath100 , level @xmath7 , whenever @xmath123 and @xmath135 are coprime .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable property of the modular matrices @xmath104 and @xmath103 is that they are rational combinations of roots of unity , in this case @xmath118roots of unity @xcite .",
    "even more remarkable is the fact that this situation is completely general : any rcft has matrices @xmath104 and @xmath103 that have their coefficients in cyclotomic extensions of finite degree over @xmath57 . for @xmath103 , it follows from the fact that in a rcft , the virasoro central charge @xmath136 and all conformal weights are rational numbers @xcite . the corresponding result for @xmath104 has been proved in @xcite , whose authors built on results from @xcite .",
    "let us first fix our notations concerning cyclotomic extensions . for @xmath137 , we will denote by @xmath138 the cyclotomic extension of the rationals by @xmath139roots of unity , of degree @xmath140 , the euler totient function , over @xmath57 .",

    "the galois automorphisms of the algebraic extension where the coefficients of @xmath104 lie , have important consequences for the modular problem , which we now summarize .",
    "each element of the abelian galois group of the relevant extension induces the unique permutation of the weights of the alcve @xmath145 ( we keep the same name for the element of the galois group and for the induced permutation ) , such that ( s_p , p ) = s_(p),p = s_p,(p ) , where @xmath146 is a cocycle satisfying @xmath147 . acting with @xmath148 on the commutation relation",
    "@xmath149=0 $ ] and using the fact that the coefficients @xmath96 are rational numbers , one obtains that @xmath123 must satisfy @xcite n_(p),(p ) = n_p , p , .",
    "this equation is a necessary condition for @xmath123 to commute with @xmath104 .",
    "its importance for the modular problem is obvious .",
    "since the entries of @xmath123 are to be non  negative integers , it leads to the selection rule : n_p , p = 0  .",
    "[ selection ] its utility is two  fold .",
    "first , it turns out to be extremely restrictive , forcing most of the coefficients to vanish .",
    "even though in actual cases , it may not be easy to determine which coefficients may or may not vanish , it still remains much easier than the commutation problem .",
    "second , it facilitates enormously computer searches , because in the examples we know , which include all affine algebras , to check the sign of @xmath150 is computationally trivial .",
    "the first use of ( [ selection ] ) was made in the restricted context of @xmath0 , @xmath56 prime @xcite , where however neither its generality nor its galoisian origin were recognized .",
    "they were later generalized to all affine algebras in @xcite , and eventually to all rcft in @xcite where the galoisian nature of the result was transparently brought out .    from the formula ( [ smatrix ] ) for the matrix @xmath104 , in which one may neglect the prefactor @xmath151 since one is interested in commuting @xmath123 with @xmath104 , the action of the galois automorphism @xmath152 amounts formally to multiply the weight @xmath39 ( or @xmath153 ) by @xmath143 : @xmath154 .",
    "this action of @xmath152 is only formal since in general @xmath155 is not in the alcve @xmath28 .",
    "however one can show that @xmath143 being invertible modulo @xmath56 ensures there is a unique affine weyl transformation which maps @xmath155 on some weight @xmath156 of @xmath28 , so we can write _ h(p ) = w_h , p(hp ) + n , w w , r. [ perm ] one then obtains from ( [ smatrix ] ) _",
    "h(ns_p , p ) = _ w w ( w ) e^-2i _ h(p ) ( w_h , pw)(p)/n = ( w_h , p ) ( n s__h(p),p ) .",
    "therefore the permutation of @xmath28 induced by an element of the galois group is given in ( [ perm ] ) , and the cocycle is just the parity of the weyl transformation defining the permutation , @xmath157 , up to the sign @xmath158 , that only depends on @xmath143 .",
    "the same is true of any affine algebra .",
    "for that reason , the cocycles have been termed `` parities '' in the literature .",

    "this will be extensively used in the next sections to uniformize the fermat curves , and other related curves .",
    "the symmetry group of a triangulation has a natural definition .",
    "it consists of the relabellings of the flags that do not change the combinatorial data , i.e. that commute with the action of the cartographic group . as the cartographic group acts transitively on flags , an element of the symmetry group that fixes one flag has to be the identity . for the same reason ,",
    "the orbits of the symmetry group all have the same number of elements .",

    "it is almost obvious ( and can be checked along lines similar to the proof above that @xmath192 and @xmath502 are the same riemann surface ) that the action of the symmetry group induces holomorphic automorphisms of the associated riemann surface .    as mentioned above",
    ", the cartographic group can be used to encode the combinatorics of a polygonal decomposition of a closed oriented surface . for the triangulation of a riemann surface given by the inverse image of the standard triangulation of the sphere by a map ramified only over 0 , 1 and @xmath425",

    "let us fix such a riemann surface and such a map .",
    "this time , we use a group , which we call the triangular group , that permutes the faces of the triangulation .",

    "it has three generators of order 2 : @xmath513 , @xmath514 and @xmath515 .",
    "if @xmath432 is a face of the triangulation , the edge of @xmath432 opposite to the vertex @xmath423 ( _ i.e. _ joining the vertices @xmath424 and @xmath425 ) is common to exactly one other face @xmath504 , and we set @xmath516 .",
    "the other two generators are defined analogously .",
    "the triangular group specifies which triangle is glued to which other triangle and along which edge , so it gives all is needed to reconstruct the surface .",
    "it contains an invariant subgroup of index 2 with generators _",
    "0=__1 , _ 1=_0 _ , _",
    "geometrically , @xmath517 is a rotation around the vertex @xmath430 , mapping a triangle touching @xmath430 to the next one of the same colour .",
    "the order of @xmath517 is half the number of triangles meeting at @xmath430 .",
    "they clearly satisfy @xmath518 , so this subgroup , called the oriented triangular group for obvious reasons , is a quotient group of @xmath459 .",
    "hence there is a unique epimorphism from @xmath459 to the oriented triangular group sending @xmath519 to @xmath520 , @xmath521 to @xmath522 and @xmath523 to @xmath524 .",
    "the oriented triangular group is important for two reasons .",
    "first it contains the same combinatorial information as the full triangular group .",
    "indeed , since it maps white faces into white faces and black faces into black faces , it says how the vertices of faces of a given color are linked to each other , and thus specifies all the edge identifications needed to completely reconstruct the surface .",
    "second , it is easier to compute than the cartographic group , and yet allows to describe the latter more easily than what was done before .",
    "the idea is simple , but requires first to find an appropriate parametrization of the flags . with the flag @xmath429",
    ", we associate a permutation @xmath525 of the symbol @xmath526 : the first element is the label of @xmath430 , the second is the label of the other vertex of @xmath431 and the third is the last label remaining . then with the same flag @xmath429",
    ", we associate the white triangle @xmath527 that has @xmath431 in common with @xmath432 , and we write @xmath528 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath529 be @xmath423 if @xmath525 is an even permutation and @xmath424 if it is an odd permutation of @xmath526 .",
    "it is then easy to check that & & = [ ( jlk),_j^(jkl)(t ) ] , + & & = [ ( kjl),t ] , + & & = [ ( klj),_k^-(klj)(t ) ] . from these",
    ", one computes the action of the @xmath486 group to be & & _ 0[(jkl),t ] = [ ( jkl),_k t ] , + & & _ 1[(jkl),t ] = [ ( jkl),_j^(jlk)_l_j^-(jlk)t ] , + & & _ [ ( jkl),t ] = [ ( jkl),_j t ] . the equation for @xmath530 is a little bit surprising , but is needed to ensure the relation @xmath531 .",
    "this shows that although the group @xmath486 is closely related to the oriented triangular group , they do not coincide , the former being in general bigger .",
    "the three generators @xmath532 , @xmath530 and @xmath533 all have the same order @xmath56 , the least common multiple of the orders of @xmath520 , @xmath522 and @xmath524 .",
    "because it is of particular importance for what follows , we will explore , for the rest of this section , the case where the oriented triangular group associated with @xmath492 is abelian .",
    "the above relations simplify to read & & _ 0[(jkl),t ] = [ ( jkl),_k t ] , + & & _ 1[(jkl),t ] = [ ( jkl),_l t ] , + & & _ [ ( jkl),t ] = [ ( jkl),_j t ] .",
    "thus the group @xmath486 is also abelian , and is isomorphic to a subgroup of @xmath534 ( or more invariantly of the quotient of @xmath535 by the diagonal @xmath536 ) .",
    "if @xmath537 , one can even give a presentation of the cartographic group , which we denote by @xmath538 , by generators and relations , _",
    "i.e. _ one can determine the kernel @xmath539 of the homomorphism from @xmath91 to @xmath540 . as the relation @xmath541 is automatic in terms of the generators @xmath18 and @xmath148 , the commutation of @xmath532 , @xmath530 and @xmath533 amounts to @xmath542 , or @xmath543 . using @xmath544 and @xmath545 ,",

    "after these preliminaries , we are ready to associate modular forms ( for the invariant subgroup @xmath539 of @xmath91 ) to the holomorphic differentials on the fermat curves .",
    "it is a well  known fact in algebraic geometry that if the zero set of @xmath601 , a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath565 , is a smooth curve in @xmath549 , the holomorphic differentials on that curve take the form q(u , v , w)(- ) , where @xmath602 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath603 .",

    "we shall rather examine the similarities and differences between these modular forms for @xmath539 and the characters of the @xmath0 affine algebra at level @xmath617 .    as mentioned earlier , the number of ( unrestricted ) characters is the same as the number of @xmath618 s .",
    "the restricted characters however are not linearly independent .",
    "moreover , characters are functions and the differentials on @xmath238 are forms .",
    "this is not too serious .",
    "one possible remedy is as follows : on @xmath619 there is only one holomorphic differential , and the corresponding modular form is easily seen to be @xmath620 , whereas the character at height 3 is the constant function 1 .",
    "however the denominator of the weyl ",
    "kac character formula is @xmath621 , so that the numerator is naturally a modular form of weight 4 , _",

    "this makes plausible the fact that to find analogies , it is perhaps better to concentrate on the numerators of characters .",
    "we shall elaborate a little bit on that at the end of this section .",
    "observe that @xmath610 does not change if one multiplies @xmath622 , @xmath623 , @xmath527 and @xmath56 by a common factor ( this is clearly related to the map @xmath624 from @xmath593 to @xmath625 ) , but this property is not shared by the characters ( though the alcve @xmath28 is properly embedded in @xmath626 ) .",
    "however we have seen in section 2 that the numerators of characters satisfy more involved identities of the same kind having a similar origin .",
    "one might be tempted to see another common point in the fact that both sets carry a representation of the modular group for which only a finite quotient acts , and which is in general highly reducible . for the characters ,",
    "this is a well  known fact . for the holomorphic differentials on @xmath238 , it is related to the regularity of the triangulation induced by the map @xmath592 .",
    "however the two representations are very different . from the above formulas , one obtains the modular transformations of ( [ orst ] ) _ r , s , t(+1 ) = ^t _ s , r , t ( ) , _ r , s , t ( ) = -^2 16^(r - t)/n _ t , s , r ( ) .",
    "thus for the holomorphic differentials on @xmath238 , the modular group merely permutes @xmath622 , @xmath623 and @xmath527 and multiplies by phases .",

    "one can nevertheless try to push the analogy with the affine @xmath0 characters by looking at the modular problem for the differentials on @xmath238 .",

    "thus the analogy between the two modular problems is somewhat disappointing , but there is still a curious fact .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath49expansion of the characters are integers .",
    "this is in general not true for the holomorphic differentials on @xmath238 , and in fact happens quite seldom . from our explicit formula ,",
    "the @xmath49expansion of @xmath610 has integer coefficients ( or even bounded denominators , which is a normalization invariant statement ) if and only if @xmath643 and @xmath644 are both multiples of @xmath56 .",
    "it is then not difficult to make a catalogue of all triplets satisfying these conditions .",
    "if we assume , without loss of generality , that gcd@xmath642 , one finds the straightforward but puzzling result :     @xmath56 is necessarily a divisor of 24 ;     the @xmath49expansion of @xmath645 contains only integer coefficients if and only if @xmath645 appears in a modular invariant for @xmath238 ;     the four exceptional @xmath0 modular invariant partition functions appearing at height equal to 8 , 12 or 24 , involve characters labelled by triplets @xmath240 which all satisfy the above conditions , so that the corresponding forms @xmath610 have integer coefficients in their @xmath49expansion .",
    "they however do not exhaust the list of triplets with this property .    to prove the first two points",
    ", one simply notes that @xmath646 imply @xmath638 .",
    "a ( generalized ) billiard is a planar domain with piecewise smooth boundary . a classical particle moving in such a domain is simply reflected when it hits the boundary , but moves freely otherwise .",
    "the spectrum of the corresponding quantum mechanical system is related to the dirichlet problem for the laplace operator .",
    "the general case can be very complicated .",
    "when the domain is a euclidian triangle with rational angles ( in units of @xmath647 ) , the classical phase space has an interesting geometric structure : it has a foliation by closed topological surfaces .",
    "in fact the leaves have a natural complex structure @xcite .",
    "we will briefly review this construction . on the way we will see that many quantities we encountered in section 3 reappear quite naturally .",
    "we will then present yet another intriguing relation with the exceptional modular invariants for the @xmath0 wznw models .",
    "navely , a point in the classical phase space is a pair @xmath648 where @xmath649 is a position ( a point of the triangle ) and @xmath650 a momentum ( an arbitrary two  dimensional vector ) .",
    "however , to take into account reflections when the particle hits the boundary , the real phase space is a quotient .",
    "the points @xmath648 and @xmath651 are identified if @xmath652 and if @xmath650 is obtained from @xmath653 by a reflection in the edge containing @xmath649 .",
    "then the phase space is a union of triangles , labelled by momenta , with some edges identified .",
    "more precisely , let us assume that the angles of the triangle are @xmath654 , @xmath655 and @xmath656 , with @xmath657 four strictly positive integers satisfying @xmath242 , and gcd@xmath642 .",
    "clearly the norm of the momentum is irrelevant so we can focus on its phase , writing @xmath658 .",
    "if the triangle lies with its base horizontal , the reflections through the boundaries change @xmath209 according to _ 0 & : & -- , + _ 1 & : & -+ , + _ & : & - . here",
    "@xmath659 denotes the reflection through the boundary opposite to the vertex @xmath430 , and @xmath660 and @xmath425 correspond respectively to the corners @xmath639 .",
    "the horizontal base is the edge linking 0 ( left corner ) to 1 ( right corner ) .",
    "obviously , the momentum of the particle on its trajectory can take @xmath294 values ( we exclude the momenta leading to singular trajectories in which the particle hits the corners ) .",
    "thus in phase space , the particle moves on a submanifold consisting of @xmath294 copies of the triangle ( the billiard ) , labelled by the values of @xmath209 ( and a value of @xmath39 ) , and this gives a foliation of the phase space .",
    "each such submanifold is a compact combinatorial connected surface without boundary .",
    "it is a surface without boundary because every edge is common to exactly two triangles , due to the above identification , and it is connected because one can reach every triangle from any other by a series of reflections .",
    "the surface would not be compact if some angles were irrational , in which case the leaves of the foliation may well be dense in phase space . from now on we restrict to the rational case .",
    "the combinatorial description of the surface made up of the @xmath294 triangles is obviously the same for all initial values of the momentum .",
    "the reflection group , generated by @xmath661 and @xmath662 , permutes the triangles that build the surface .",

    "@xmath664 , @xmath665 ) for the common factor between @xmath622 ( resp .",
    "@xmath623 , @xmath527 ) and @xmath56 , and write @xmath666 .",
    "let also @xmath667 ( or simply @xmath668 when no confusion is possible ) denote the associated combinatorial surface , which is a generic leaf of the foliation of phase space .    from the action of @xmath659 ,",
    "the generators @xmath520 , @xmath522 , and @xmath524 are represented on @xmath209 by a clockwise rotation of angle @xmath669 , @xmath670 and @xmath671 respectively .",
    "they commute and satisfy @xmath672 .",
    "they satisfy other relations as well , as it is clear that the oriented triangular group is isomorphic to @xmath536 , because , since @xmath622 , @xmath623 and @xmath527 are relatively prime , we can find integers @xmath119 , @xmath673 and @xmath136 such that @xmath674 , so @xmath675 is a rotation of angle @xmath676 .",
    "one can also check that the triangular group is the dihedral group of order @xmath294 , and that the @xmath486 group is d(t_r , s , t ) = it is amusing to note that the structure of @xmath486 is very reminiscent of the complementary series of @xmath0 modular invariants ( also called the @xmath677series ) .",
    "following section 4.1 , one can use these results to uniformize @xmath678 .",
    "let us first compute its genus .",
    "the triangulation consists of @xmath294 triangles , @xmath118 edges , @xmath663 vertices of type @xmath423 , @xmath664 vertices of type @xmath424 , and @xmath665 vertices of type @xmath679 .",
    "indeed for vertices of type 0 for instance , there are @xmath680 , twice the order of @xmath520 , triangles that meet at each vertex of type 0 ( @xmath681 white and @xmath681 black triangles ) , so that the @xmath294 such vertices get identified by groups of @xmath680 , leaving @xmath682 distinct ones .",
    "one obtains the euler characteristic @xcite 2 - 2 g = r + s + t - n.    we already know one way to put a complex structure on @xmath683 via the construction of section 4.1 .",
    "let us indicate another equivalent way .",
    "we represent each euclidean triangle of @xmath683 in the complex @xmath361plane and put the corresponding complex coordinate in the interior of the triangles back on @xmath683 .",
    "different choices differ by affinities ( @xmath684 ) , so that the complex coordinates glue holomorphically along the interior of the edge common to two triangles .",
    "it remains to deal with the vertices .",
    "let us choose a vertex @xmath430 , of type @xmath425 say .",
    "the problem is that at @xmath430 , @xmath685 triangles meet with an incident angle equal to @xmath686 , so that the argument of @xmath361 changes by a total amount of @xmath687 . if we assume , possibly after an affinity , that @xmath430 is at the origin in the complex plane , we can choose @xmath688 as a local parameter in the neighbourhood of @xmath430 on @xmath683 .",
    "this parameter glues holomorphically with @xmath361 away from the vertex . moreover , the parameters @xmath689 of the triangles incident at @xmath430 glue holomorphically to give a global coordinate in a small neighbourhood of @xmath430 . the other types of vertices are treated in an analogous fashion .",
    "that this complex structure coincides with the one given in section 4.1 is clear . a priori ,",
    "the euclidean structure of the triangle is crucial for the mechanical problem , whereas the complex structure may look very artificial .",
    "however , the differential @xmath690 , which is crucial for the classical motion ( away from the boundary , the equation of motion says that the velocity @xmath691 is constant ) , extends holomorphically on @xmath683 .",

    "the total number of zeroes is thus r ( -1 ) + s ( -1 ) + t ( -1 ) , which is just the opposite of the euler characteristic , as was to be expected .",
    "we shall see later that the other holomorphic differentials on @xmath683 also have a very natural interpretation .    because the oriented triangular group of @xmath683 is abelian , we know from section 4.1 that there is a holomorphic map from @xmath238 to the algebraic curve associated with @xmath683 . counting the triangles on the two curves",

    "though not identical , this is quite reminiscent of the third section .",
    "we can now come to another `` coincidence '' .",
    "we have seen in section 2 that the parity rule puts severe restrictions on the possible couplings among characters in a modular invariant partition function .",
    "this parity rule was expressed in terms of the sets @xmath728 where @xmath240 were interpreted as the affine dynkin labels of integrable weights .",
    "then the characters @xmath729 and @xmath730 can be coupled only if @xmath731 .",
    "we have just seen that @xmath732 also describes the billiards that are associated to the same triangular curve @xmath283 .",
    "but there is a direct and puzzling though incomplete connection between triangular curves and modular invariants , that in addition involves non  invertible elements of @xmath536 .",
    "we start with @xmath285 , the fermat curve of degree 24 .",
    "we have seen that @xmath285 is a covering of some triangular curves , which themselves are coverings of other triangular curves .",
    "let us first consider the triplet @xmath733 , associated with the character of the identity operator at height @xmath396 , and take all its multiples by elements @xmath143 of @xmath734 .",
    "after reduction modulo 24 , we keep only those triplets which have no zero component and whose sum is equal to 24 , obtaining in this way 11 triplets ( or triangles ) .",
    "if one classifies them according to the genus of the associated triangular curve , one finds 4 triangles of genus 11 , 2 of genus 5 , 2 of genus 3 , 2 of genus 2 , and 2 of genus 1 , the last two being associated with two non  isomorphic genus 1 surfaces .",

    "one observes that the triangles associated with @xmath735 for @xmath743 and 8 give precisely the content of the block of the identity in the exceptional modular invariant at height @xmath251 .",
    "the only element which is not encoded in the picture is whether a character that is labelled by the permutation of a triangle appears or not .",
    "more precisely , one sees that :     for @xmath744 : the four triangles ( of genus 11 ) are @xmath733 , @xmath745 , @xmath746 and @xmath747 .",
    "the exceptional invariant at height 24 is e_24 = |_(1,1,22 ) + _ ( 5,5,14 ) + _ ( 7,7,10 ) + _ ( 11,11,2 ) + |^2 + ",
    "so all permutations appear .     for @xmath748 : the two triangles are @xmath749 and @xmath750 , and the invariant partition function reads e_12 = |_(1,1,10 ) + _ ( 5 , 5 , 2 ) + |^2 +  so again all permutations appear .     for @xmath751 : there are two triangles , @xmath752 and @xmath753 .",

    "the same pattern persists for the smaller values of @xmath251 : for @xmath754 , the triangle @xmath755 specifies the identity block in the diagonal and complementary invariants depending on whether permutations are included or not , whereas for @xmath738 and 3 , the identity blocks of the diagonal invariants are reproduced .",
    "one is tempted to apply the same idea to the other blocks of the exceptional invariants , starting for instance with the triangle @xmath756 appearing in the second block of @xmath757 .",
    "alas , the outcome is disappointing , and that is one of the reasons to believe that our observations , however troublesome , are mere coincidences .",
    "in this last part , we would like to see to what extent the action of the modular group on the characters of a general rational conformal field theory can be related to its action on algebraic curves , which we might then want to identify . in particular , rational conformal field theories like to organize in families indexed by integers ( for example the height in wznw models ) , and it is therefore a natural question to ask whether these families can be put in correspondence with families of curves , just like the @xmath758 wznw models are related to the fermat curves in the way detailed in the previous sections .",
    "we show here that a compact riemann surface can be canonically associated with any rational conformal field theory .",

    "the surprise however is that the curve associated with @xmath761 possesses a covering by the fermat curve of degree 12 , and is nothing but one of the triangular curves .",
    "we start with some general facts , which are true for the wznw models , but that otherwise might well be consequences of the general axioms that a rational conformal field theory has to fulfill . since we are not aware of a complete derivation of them , we content ourselves with listing them as mere assumptions .    1 .",
    "the theory involves only a finite number @xmath123 of representations of the chiral algebra .",
    "we denote them by @xmath23 , @xmath762 , with the convention that @xmath763 contains the identity operator ( or the operator of smallest conformal weight in the non  unitary case ) .",

    "@xcite ) , and the statement relative to the compact surface @xmath771 is proved in appendix a.    we now come to the question of the explicit and concrete description of @xmath771 , by means of algebraic equations .",

    "characters are meromorphic at the infinite parabolic point because the eigenvalues of @xmath34 in the representations of the chiral algebra are rational and bounded below .",
    "to conclude for another puncture ( necessarily a rational point on the real axis ) , one chooses an element @xmath186 of @xmath91 that maps it to @xmath775 and use the fact that @xmath91 acts linearly on the characters .",

    "it is weaker if the matrix element of @xmath186 between @xmath44 and @xmath867 vanishes .",
    "this proof parallels the argument showing that @xmath868 is real positive for any @xmath39 .",
    "the function field @xmath869 of @xmath771 certainly contains all rational functions of the characters @xmath44 and of the modular invariant @xmath63 . that it contains nothing more",
    "can be proved in the following way . a classical theorem states that , given a non  constant meromorphic function @xmath432 on @xmath771 of degree @xmath280 , the function field @xmath870 is a simple galois extension of @xmath871 of degree @xmath280 @xcite .",
    "that is , there exists a function @xmath186 satisfying an irreducible polynomial equation of degree @xmath280 with coefficients in @xmath871 , in terms of which @xmath872 . choosing @xmath873 , of degree @xmath874 , shows that @xmath870 is a galois extension of degree @xmath874 of @xmath875 , with galois group @xmath876 .",

    "but in fact the elements of @xmath881 corresponding to invariants under @xmath801 ( of the form ( [ seq ] ) ) give a complete set of equations for @xmath771 , because they describe a covering of the @xmath63sphere containing the model for @xmath771 with at most @xmath888 leaves .",

    "in fact these arguments also solve the problem of the second generator  of the function field @xmath870 , and provide another model for @xmath771 .",
    "since the matrices @xmath104 and @xmath103 generate a finite group of order @xmath888 , we can find a linear combination @xmath893 of the characters such that its orbit under @xmath801 is of cardinal @xmath888 . from this",
    "follows that @xmath186 satisfies the irreducible polynomial equation _ ( x - g ) = 0 .",

    "there is at least one polynomial invariant which is easy to obtain : since all left and right matrices have determinant 1 , the determinant of @xmath1064 is invariant under @xmath801 .",
    "a look at the puiseux series shows that it is regular at @xmath1065 , and that the zero  th order coefficient is equal to 3 , so that it is exactly equal to 3 : p_2(_i ) = _ 0 _ 3 - _ 1 _ 2 = 3 .",
    "[ determ ]    the ring of polynomial invariants for @xmath801 is more complicated than in the level 1 case .",
    "the molien series for the number of invariants is f(t ) = 1+t^12+t^20+t^24 + 2t^30+t^36+t^40+t^48+t^60 ( 1-t^2)(1-t^12)(1-t^20)(1-t^30 ) .",
    "[ ffull ] it shows that the ring is not freely generated by four invariants , but that there are more generators with relations among them . in this case , the ring of invariants is a free module over @xmath1066 with basis @xmath1067 , where the @xmath889 s are `` fundamental '' invariants of degree @xmath965 , and the @xmath1068 s are `` auxiliary '' invariants .",
    "every @xmath1068 can be expressed algebraically in terms of the @xmath889 s , but not polynomially .",
    "what we want to do is to compute enough independent irreducible invariants , namely three or four depending on whether they are equal to trivial functions of @xmath63 or not .",
    "we have already found one , namely @xmath1069 given in ( [ determ ] ) , which clearly accounts for the factor @xmath1070 in @xmath1071 .    in order to compute invariants for @xmath801 , one can take advantage of the quasi  factorized form of @xmath1072 .",
    "in fact we deal with a true ( even if not faithful ) representation @xmath1073 so the @xmath1074 factor is automatically taken into account . given four indeterminates @xmath1075",
    "( they will soon become @xmath1076 ) , an element @xmath1077 acts on them by left and right multiplication @xmath1078 .",
    "if we write the variables @xmath1075 in terms of four others @xmath1079 through = , [ tensor ] then obviously @xmath1080 acts on the @xmath1081 s whereas @xmath1082 acts on the @xmath430 s .",
    "it is clear that upon this substitution , a polynomial invariant @xmath1083 for @xmath801 becomes a ( perhaps identically vanishing ) linear combination of product polynomials @xmath1084 with @xmath1085 invariant under @xmath1045 and @xmath1086 invariant under @xmath1047 .",
    "we would like to go backwards as well , _",
    "i.e. _ start with polynomial invariants @xmath1087 for @xmath1045 and @xmath1088 for @xmath1047 and construct a polynomial invariant @xmath1083 for @xmath801 .",
    "this involves a nice analogy with wick contractions .",
    "we define formal 2point functions @xmath1089 , @xmath1090 , @xmath1091 , @xmath1092 , and all others zero .",
    "the expectation value of a monomial in @xmath1093 , @xmath1094 , @xmath1095 and @xmath1096 is the polynomial in @xmath1097 , @xmath1098 , @xmath1099 and @xmath361 obtained by doing all wick contractions ( obviously , this gives @xmath423 unless the degrees in the @xmath1081 and @xmath430 variables are equal ) , and we extend to all polynomials by linearity .",
    "we also include a normalization factor and shall use the explicit general formula u_1^u_2^n-",
    "v_1^v_2^n- = n ^-1 _ a=(0,+-n)^ ( , ) an -- a w^a x^-a y^-a z^n --- a .",
    "[ wick ] as is clear from the properties of correlation functions in field theory , for consistency wick contractions must transform covariantly under linear transformations of the fields .",
    "a formal argument is easy to build . in particular",
    "if one does a linear transformation of the fields that leaves the polynomial in the fields invariant , the correlator is invariant .",
    "thus , if @xmath1087 is an invariant for @xmath1045 and @xmath1088 an invariant for @xmath1047 , @xmath1100 is an invariant for @xmath801 .",
    "so if we start from an arbitrary polynomial invariant @xmath1083 , substitute the @xmath1081 and @xmath430 variables according to eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) , and take the expectation value , we get a new polynomial @xmath1101 such that @xmath1102 gives @xmath423 upon the substitution of the @xmath1081 and @xmath430 variables .",
    "now we use a trivial fact from algebra , related to the simplest plcker embedding of algebraic geometry : the ideal of polynomials in @xmath1097 , @xmath1098 , @xmath1099 and @xmath361 vanishing identically upon substituting the @xmath1081 and @xmath430 variables is principal and generated by the determinant @xmath1103 . hence @xmath1102 has to be a multiple of @xmath1103 and the quotient is of course invariant because @xmath1103 is .",
    "we can repeat the construction . at every step the degree decreases",
    "so the procedure must stop .",
    "this shows that all invariants are polynomials in the determinant @xmath1103 with coefficients being the expectation value invariants .",
    "if @xmath1104 and @xmath1105 denote the number of degree @xmath56 invariants for @xmath1045 and @xmath1047 , the above construction yield @xmath1106 invariants for @xmath801 of degree @xmath56 . from & & f_l(t ) = _ n=0^d_n^(l ) t^n = 1 + t^12 ( 1-t^6)(1-t^8 ) , [ fleft ] + & & f_r(t ) = _ n=0^d_n^(r ) t^n = 1 + t^30 ( 1-t^12)(1-t^20 ) [ fright ] , one finds the generating function for the number of invariants for @xmath801 induced from those of @xmath1045 and @xmath1047 : _",
    "n=0^d_n^(l)d_n^(r ) t^n = 1+t^12+t^20+t^24 + 2t^30+t^36+t^40+t^48+t^60 ( 1-t^12)(1-t^20)(1-t^30 ) .",
    "as announced , the missing factor is due to the contribution of @xmath1103 .",
    "we now proceed to give the invariants of lowest degree explicitly .    from ( [ fleft ] ) ,",
    "all polynomial invariants for @xmath1045 can be expressed in terms of only three invariants , of degree 6,8 and 12 : & & p^l_6 = 8 u_1 ^ 6 - 20 u_1 ^ 3 u_2 ^ 3 - u_2 ^ 6 , + & & p^l_8 = 8 u_1 ^ 7 u_2 + 7 u_1 ^ 4 u_2 ^ 4 - u_1 u_2 ^ 7 , + & & r^l_12 = 64 u_1 ^ 12 + 704 u_1 ^ 9 u_2 ^ 3 + 88 u_1 ^ 3 u_2 ^ 9 - u_2 ^ 12 .",

    "likewise for the right factor , all invariants can be written in terms of three invariants of degree 12 , 20 and 30 : & & p^r_12 = v_1 ^ 11 v_2 + 11 v_1 ^ 6 v_2 ^ 6 - v_1 v_2 ^ 11 , + & & p^r_20 = v_1 ^ 20 - 228 v_1 ^ 15 v_2 ^ 5 + 494 v_1 ^ 10 v_2 ^ 10 + 228 v_1 ^ 5 v_2 ^ 15 + v_2 ^ 20 , + & & r^r_30 = v_1 ^ 30 + 522 v_1 ^ 25 v_2 ^ 5 - 10005 v_1 ^ 20 v_2 ^ 10 - 10005 v_1 ^ 10 v_2 ^ 20 - 522 v_1 ^ 5 v_2 ^ 25 + v_2 ^ 30 .",
    "there is one right invariant of degree 12 , and one of degree 20 .    from the generating function ( [ ffull ] ) , the degrees of the five lowest irreducible invariants for @xmath801 are 2 , 12 , 12 , 20 and 20 . in terms of left and",
    "right invariants , they are given by the following wick products : & & p_2 = wz - xy (= 3 ) , + & & p_12 = [ p^l_6]^2 p^r_12 (= + 294816 7 +  ) , + & & p_12 = r^l_12 p^r_12 (= + 66432 +  ) , + & & p_20 = [ p^l_6]^2 p^l_8 p^r_20 (= + 13621248 17q - 22400979840 187 +  ) , + & & p_20 = r^l_12 p^l_8 p^r_20 (= - 7612416 17q - 15570897408 17 +  )",
    ". we have indicated in parenthesis the first terms of the puiseux series of the invariants when one substitutes @xmath1110 for @xmath1075 .",
    "one sees , upon the same substitution , that @xmath1069 , @xmath1111 and @xmath1112 are modular invariant functions , holomorphic in the upper half  plane , hence equal to pure constants , given respectively by 3 , @xmath1113 and @xmath1114 .",
