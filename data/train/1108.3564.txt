    "many protostellar outflows are observed in star - forming regions .",
    "these outflows are believed to be universally driven by a protostar and play a critical role in star formation@xcite .",
    "the protostellar outflow may determine star formation efficiency , especially in low - mass star formation process .",
    "the similarity between the core mass function and the initial mass function implies that only a certain fraction of the prestellar core is converted into the star @xcite .",
    "recent observations have shown that , in a single prestellar core , star formation efficiency is limited to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that star formation efficiency might be limited by the protostellar outflow . with a simple analytical approach",
    ", they showed that a wide - opening - angle outflow sweeps up the gas in the infalling envelope and ejects it into the interstellar space .",
    "they concluded that the protostellar outflow can limit star formation efficiency to @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , feedback from the protostellar outflow may maintain interstellar turbulence and affect subsequent star formation @xcite .",
    "thus , the protostellar outflow is crucial in ( low - mass ) star formation .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to model the outflow using only an analytical approach because the outflow driving depends on various conditions such as the infalling mass rate onto the circumstellar disk , the size of the circumstellar disk , the configuration and the strength of the magnetic field around the protostar .",
    "thus , numerical simulation is necessary to understand the driving and evolution of the outflow during star formation and to determine star formation efficiency , as controlled by the protostellar outflow , in more detail .",
    "some authors have used a spherically symmetric calculation to investigate the evolution of a prestellar cloud until protostar formation @xcite .",
    "now , we can directly calculate the star formation from the prestellar cloud stage until protostar formation with a multi - dimensional calculation @xcite . before protostar formation , the first ( adiabatic ) core forms @xcite and drives a wide - opening - angle outflow @xcite .",
    "after protostar formation , the first core evolves directly into the circumstellar disk after the protostar formation @xcite . since the first core transitions smoothly to the circumstellar disk , the outflow driven by the first core before protostar formation is driven by the circumstellar disk after protostar formation without a transient disappearance . in summary , a wide - opening - angle outflow appears before protostar formation and continues to be driven after protostar formation until the end of the main accretion phase @xcite .",
    "this type of outflow is believed to correspond to the molecular outflow frequently observed in star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "recently , a bipolar molecular outflow was observed around the candidate first core per - bolo 58 @xcite .",
    "in addition , some first core candidates were reported by several authors @xcite .",
    "thus , to estimate the mass ejection rate from the host cloud or star formation efficiency , we need to calculate the evolution of the protostellar outflow from the prestellar core stage because a wide - opening - outflow appears before protostar formation .",
    "in addition to the wide - opening - angle outflow , well collimated high - velocity jets are observed in the star forming region @xcite .",
    "such a jet also appears during star formation process , and is driven in very close proximity to the protostar @xcite .",
    "the driving source and its spatial scale of each flow ( wide - opening - angle outflow and well collimated jet ) are considerably different : the driving source for the wide - opening - angle flow is the first core or the circumstellar disk , which has a size of @xmath7au , whereas the driving source for the well collimated jet is the protostar and the disk near the protostar in the region of @xmath8au @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mass ejection rate of the wide - opening - angle flow is much higher than that of the well collimated jet .",
    "because the jet has a good collimation , it can not accumulate sufficient mass in the infalling envelope to reduce star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "note that the difference in collimation between the wide - opening - angle outflow and well collimated jet is caused by the driving mechanism and the configuration of the magnetic field lines around the driving source @xcite .",
    "a statistical study of molecular outflows observed in various star forming regions also indicates that the ( wide - opening - angle ) molecular outflows have a sufficient energy or momentum to control the star formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the wide - opening - angle outflow and not the well collimated jet is expected to be important in determining star formation efficiency .",
    "thus , to estimate the mass ejection rate ( or star formation efficiency ) , we must resolve the driving source of the wide - opening - angle outflow , whereas we do not necessarily need to resolve the protostar itself , which drives the well collimated jet .",
    "since previous studies spatially resolved the protostar , they could not directly estimate the resulting mass ejection rate by the protostellar outflow and star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "they calculated the evolution of the protostellar outflow only for a short duration of @xmath9yr at most , whereas the main accretion phase lasts for at least @xmath10yr .",
    "it is difficult to calculate the evolution of the protostellar outflow for a long duration by resolving the protostar itself because the timescales ( time steps ) in the regions around the protostar and the molecular cloud are quite different .    on the other hand , without resolving the driving source of the protostellar outflow , some studies focused on the long - term evolution of the protostellar outflow propagating into the interstellar medium . in these studies ,",
    "the outflow is input artificially in the computational domain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the circumstellar disk , the configuration , and the strength of the magnetic field are also adopted arbitrarily . even with this type of calculation , we can not estimate star formation efficiency because the mass ejection rate is artificially assumed in such studies .    at the expense of spatial resolution around the protostar ,",
    "@xcite calculated the evolution of the collapsing cloud from the prestellar stage until the end of the main accretion phase . in their study , the driving source of the outflow ( i.e. , the first core and the circumstellar disk ) was well resolved spatially , whereas the protostar was not resolved and was replaced by sink cells .",
    "they pointed out that the protostellar outflow reduces star formation efficiency to @xmath11 .",
    "however , they investigated only the evolution of a low - mass cloud core ( @xmath12 ) and did not investigate the evolution of a cloud with a typical mass scale of @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this study , using conditions similar to those in @xcite , we calculate the evolution of a cloud with various initial masses and investigate the evolution of the outflow and the impact of the protostellar outflow on star formation efficiency .",

    "the framework of our models and the numerical method are described in  2 .",
    "the numerical results are presented in  3 .",
    "the mass ejection rate and star formation efficiency are discussed in  4 .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "to investigate star formation efficiency and long - term evolution of the protostellar outflow , we calculate the star formation process from the prestellar core stage until the end of the main accretion phase for clouds with various masses using three - dimensional resistive mhd equations , including self - gravity : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denote the density , velocity , pressure , magnetic flux density , resistivity , and gravitational potential , respectively . to mimic the temperature evolution calculated by @xcite",

    "equation  ( [ eq : eos ] ) shows that the gas behaves isothermally for @xmath26 and adiabatically for @xmath27 . for the realistic evolution of the magnetic field during star formation",
    ", we adopt a resistivity ( @xmath19 ) of the fiducial value in @xcite , in which ohmic dissipation becomes effective for @xmath28 ( for details , see eqs .  [",
    "9 ] and [ 10 ] and fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this study investigates star formation efficiency in a single cloud .",
    "thus , we assume an isolated cloud core embedded in the interstellar medium . as the initial state",
    ", we take a spherical cloud with a critical bonnor  ebert ( be ) density profile @xmath29 , in which a uniform density is adopted outside the sphere ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the critical be radius ) to mimic the interstellar medium .",
    "the gravitational force is ignored outside the be sphere ( @xmath32 ) to avoid the inflow of gas from outside the isolated core ( i.e. , from the interstellar medium ) .",
    "in addition , to strictly avoid mass inflow from outside the core , we prohibit mass inflow at @xmath33 .",
    "note that we do not prohibit mass outflow at the boundary between the be sphere and the interstellar medium ; the gas escapes freely from the be sphere by the protostellar outflow .",
    "hereafter , we call the gravitationally bound gas cloud within @xmath34 the host cloud .",
    "we confirmed that the total mass of the host cloud is well conserved during the calculation before the protostellar outflow reaches the cloud boundary .",
    "note that the total mass inside the host cloud is not conserved after the protostellar outflow propagates into the interstellar space ( @xmath35 ) , because the mass is ejected from the host cloud by the protostellar outflow .    since the critical",
    "be sphere is in equilibrium , we increase the density by a factor of @xmath36 to promote contraction , where @xmath36 is the density enhancement factor that represents the stability of the initial cloud .",
    "the density profile of the initial cloud is described as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the density distribution of the critical be sphere , and @xmath39 is the axisymmetric density perturbation .",
    "an initial cloud with larger @xmath36 is more unstable against gravity .",
    "the cloud stability is generally represented by a parameter @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , which is the ratio of thermal ( @xmath42 ) to gravitational ( @xmath43 ) energy . as shown in @xcite , when the be density profile is adopted , the density enhancement factor is related to the parameter @xmath40 as @xmath44 we adopt a density enhancement factor as @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "the density contrast between the center of the cloud ( @xmath47 ) and the cloud boundary ( @xmath48 ) is @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , a uniform density of @xmath50 ( i.e , @xmath51 of the central cloud density ) is adopted outside the sphere ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "to break the axial symmetry , we add a small amount of @xmath52-mode non - axisymmetric density perturbation to the initial core . for the @xmath52-mode , in equation  ( [ eq : dens ] ) , we choose @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( = 0.01 ) represents the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "the radial dependence is chosen so that the density perturbation remains regular at the origin ( @xmath55 ) at one time - step after the initial stage .",
    "this perturbation develops into a non - axisymmetric perturbation in the circumstellar disk that contributes to angular momentum transfer .",
    "in addition , this @xmath52 perturbation ensures that the center of gravity is always located at the origin .    for a dimensional",
    "be density profile , we adopt an isothermal temperature of @xmath56k and a central number density of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a parameter in the range @xmath59 .",
    "since the temperature of each initial cloud is fixed , the size ( i.e. , radius and mass ) of the be sphere is uniquely determined only by the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "thus , each model is characterized only by the initial central density , @xmath60 . with these parameters ,",
    "the critical be radius ( or radius of the host cloud ) is @xmath61au .",
    "the mass inside @xmath62 for each model is @xmath63 .",
    "the host cloud radius and mass for each model are listed in table  [ table:1 ] .    in each model",
    ", the cloud rotates rigidly around the @xmath64-axis in the @xmath65 region and a uniform magnetic field parallel to the @xmath64-axis ( or rotation axis ) is adopted in the entire computational domain .",
    "the magnetic field strength and the rotation rate are scaled using the central density @xmath66 as @xmath67 @xmath68 in all models , we adopt @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are the most appropriate parameters for driving strong outflow in the collapsing cloud @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic field and rotation are normalized by the central density and each model is characterized by only the central density , each cloud has a different magnetic field strengths and angular velocity . the magnetic field ( @xmath71 ) and angular velocity ( @xmath72 ) for each model",
    "are summarized in table  [ table:1 ] . however , all models have the same ratios of rotational and magnetic energies to the gravitational energy , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are rotational and magnetic energies , respectively .",
    "in addition , all models have the same mass - to - flux ratio @xmath79 .",
    "there exists a critical value of @xmath79 below which a cloud is supported against gravity by the magnetic field . for a cloud with uniform density",
    ", @xcite derived a critical mass - to - flux ratio @xmath80 where the constant @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio normalized by the critical value @xmath82 is described as @xmath83 all models have @xmath84 , which is slightly larger than the typical value of observation .",
    "the observations indicate that molecular cloud cores have the mass - to - flux ratio in the range of @xmath85 with a median value of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the model names and parameters are also listed in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "we believe that these energy ratios are adequate for comparing cloud evolution among models with different masses .",
    "we can match the magnetic field strength ( @xmath71 ) and rotation rate ( @xmath72 ) for clouds with different masses .",
    "however , since doing so changes the evolution of the cloud and the protostellar outflow , it is difficult to compare the star formation efficiency of the models .",
    "for example , when the initial magnetic field strength is fixed among the models , no outflow may appear in a less massive cloud because it has a small ratio of magnetic energy to gravitational energy .    in this paper , to compare cloud evolution among models , we usually use the freefall timescale at the center , @xmath47 ( @xmath87 ) , and boundary , @xmath33 ( @xmath88 ) , of the initial cloud as the unit of time .",
    "since the density contrast between the center of the cloud and its boundary is 14 , the freefall timescale of the cloud boundary is about 3.7 times longer than that at the center of the cloud ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the freefall timescale at the center of the initial cloud ( @xmath87 ) for each model is listed in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "to realize the long - term calculation of star formation , we adopt a sink at the center of the cloud .",
    "we start the calculation without a sink and calculate the cloud evolution for the prestellar gas collapse phase without a sink .",
    "later , we identify protostar formation in the collapsing cloud core when the number density exceeds @xmath90 at the cloud center , where @xmath91 is the threshold density .",
    "after protostar formation , we calculate the cloud evolution with the sink .",
    "to model the protostar , we adopt a fixed sink with a radius of @xmath92au composed of sink cells only around the center of the computational domain . since we add only @xmath52 density perturbation , as described in  [ sec : setting ] , the protostar ( or center of gravity ) does not move and remains at the center of the computational domain during the calculation . in the region @xmath93au ,",
    "the gas having a number density of @xmath94 is removed from the computational domain and added to the protostar as a gravitating mass in each time step ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , for each time step , the accretion mass onto the protostar is calculated as @xmath95\\ , dv.\\ ] ] in addition , inside the sink , the magnetic flux is removed by ohmic dissipation because this region has a magnetic reynolds number @xmath96 exceeding unity @xmath97 ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for calculation on a large spatial scale ,",
    "the nested grid method is adopted ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each level of a rectangular grid has the same number of cells ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the calculation is first performed with five grid levels ( @xmath99 ) . in all models ,",
    "the fifth level of the grid ( @xmath100 ) has a box size of @xmath101 and just covers the entire region of the isolated be sphere .",
    "the first level of the grid has a box size of @xmath102 and is filled with low - density interstellar medium outside @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we can calculate the propagation of the protostellar outflow in the region of @xmath103 .",
    "the protostellar outflow never reaches the computational boundary by the end of the calculation .",
    "in addition , we have checked that the alfv@xmath104n waves generated at the center of the cloud ( or the computational boundary ) never reaches the computational boundary ( or the center of the cloud ) during the calculation ( for details , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "after the calculation starts , a new finer grid is generated before the jeans condition is violated @xcite . although the maximum grid level differs among the models , each model has a spatial resolution of @xmath105au in the finest grid .",
    "in this section , we present the evolution of the collapsing cloud and the outflow for typical models in  [ sec : typical ] ( model n08 , less massive cloud case ) and  [ sec : typical2 ] ( model n06 , massive cloud case ) .",
    "then , we describe the mass accretion rate (  [ sec : accretion ] ) and masses of the protostar and circumstellar disk (  [ sec : mass ] ) , and the mass ejected by the protostellar outflow (  [ sec : out ] ) . the properties of the protostellar outflow are described in  [ sec : out2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] plots the cloud evolution for model n08 from the initial state until the end of the main accretion phase ; only the @xmath106 region is shown . note",
    "that although the structure only around the initial cloud scale ( @xmath107 ) is plotted in figure  [ fig:1 ] , the computational domain has a size of @xmath108 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:1]_a _ , we adopted a spherical cloud with the be density profile and the radius of @xmath109 as the initial state .",
    "as described in  [ sec : setting ] , since we ignored the gravity outside the be sphere ( @xmath110 ) , only the gas in the @xmath111 region ( inside the white dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) can collapse to fall onto the center of the cloud .",
    "for this model , the number density exceeds @xmath90 and a protostar forms at @xmath112 , where @xmath87 ( @xmath113yr ) is the freefall timescale of the initial cloud at the center .",
    "figure  [ fig:1]_b _ shows the density distribution just after protostar formation .",
    "the red contours of @xmath114 in figure  [ fig:1]_a _ and _ b _ indicate that the cloud gradually contracts toward the center with time .",
    "the blue contour in the figure corresponds to the boundary of the protostellar outflow , inside which the gas moves outward against the center of the cloud .",
    "thus , this contour shows the shape of the protostellar outflow .",
    "the outflow is driven by the circumstellar disk that originates from the first core , which appears before protostar formation @xcite .",
    "after protostar formation , the first core becomes the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the outflow is then driven by the circumstellar disk after a smooth transition from the first core to the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the protostellar outflow remains in the host cloud ( @xmath111 ) for @xmath115yr ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]_c _ ) ; it reaches the boundary of the host cloud at @xmath116yr ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]_d _ ) and penetrates the host cloud boundary and propagates into the interstellar space ( @xmath110 ) for @xmath117yr ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]_e_-_h _ ) .",
    "the outflow driving halts inside the host cloud at @xmath118yr ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the infalling envelope is depleted and the mass accretion is almost over by this epoch (  [ sec : mass ] ) .",
    "thus , the circumstellar disk can not drive the outflow at this epoch because the outflow is powered by gas accretion onto the circumstellar disk . since the freefall timescale of the cloud boundary is @xmath120yr , a large fraction of the gas inside the host cloud",
    "has already fallen onto either the circumstellar disk or the protostar by this epoch .",
    "although the outflow at the host cloud scale completely disappears in @xmath121yr ( = @xmath122@xmath87 = @xmath123 ) , the density cavity formed by the protostellar outflow remains around the host cloud as seen in figure  [ fig:1]_i_.    figure  [ fig:1 ] also shows that the infalling envelope in the host cloud depletes with time .",
    "part of the gas inside the initial host cloud is ejected by the protostellar outflow , and the remainder falls onto either the circumstellar disk or the protostar . in figures  [ fig:1]_h _ and _ i _ , we can see only a disk - like structure with the size of @xmath124200au , because the infalling gas is depleted by this epoch . at these epochs ,",
    "the density of the infalling envelope ( @xmath125 ) is less than @xmath126 the initial cloud density ( @xmath127 ) . at the end of the calculation ( @xmath128 ) ,",
    "the mass ratio of the infalling envelope to the total mass of the initial cloud is only @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the main accretion phase has already ended by this epoch .",
    "the evolution of the outflow configuration is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "each panel corresponds to the same epoch as in figure  [ fig:1]_d _ , _ e _ , _ f _ , and _",
    "h_. figure  [ fig:2 ] shows that the protostellar outflow propagates into the interstellar space while maintaining good collimation .",
    "however , figure  [ fig:2]_a _ and _ b _ indicate that , early in the evolution , the outflow also extends in a transverse direction and increases in width . after",
    "its width becomes comparable to the host cloud scale , the outflow extends only in the vertical direction while maintaining its width .",
    "the magnetic field lines that guide the outflow are anchored by the host cloud ( or the gravitationally bound sphere ) .",
    "thus , the final width of the outflow is comparable to that of the host cloud .",
    "therefore , the outflow collimation improves with time after the outflow width becomes comparable to the host cloud scale , whereas the collimation is not good when its width is smaller than the host cloud scale or the outflow remains within the host cloud .",
    "figures  [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] show the density and velocity distributions for model n06 at @xmath130yr ( @xmath131=@xmath132 ) . for this model , the protostar forms at @xmath133yr after the cloud begins to collapse .",
    "thus , the figures show the structure @xmath134yr after the protostar formation . by this epoch ,",
    "the outflow penetrated the host cloud that has a radius of 4800au and reaches @xmath135au from the center of the cloud , as seen in figure  [ fig:3 ] left panel .",
    "the figure also shows the bow shocks caused by the protostellar outflow at @xmath136au .",
    "the upper right panel in figure  [ fig:3 ] plots the structure around the host cloud and shows that the gas flows out from the host cloud in the vertical direction by the protostellar outflow .",
    "in addition , inside the white dotted line that denotes the size of the initial cloud , the gas density is considerably lower than the ambient medium .",
    "this is because a part of the gas falls onto the central region to form the protostar and circumstellar disk , while the remainder is ejected from the host cloud by the outflow .",
    "the lower right panel is 16 times magnified view of the central region of the upper right panel .",
    "this panel shows that the outflow is strongly driven by the disk - like structure around the protostar . on this scale ,",
    "the gas accretes onto the protostar through the circumstellar disk , and a part of the accreting mater is ejected by the outflow .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the structure around the circumstellar disk on @xmath137 ( left panel ) and @xmath138 ( right panel ) planes .",
    "these panels show that the rotating disk exits around the protostar and drives the outflow .",
    "thus , it is expected that the outflow is mainly driven by the magnetocentrifugal mechanism @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] indicate that large scale outflow with a size of @xmath139au ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] left panel ) originates from the disk wind driven by the circumstellar or rapidly rotating disk with a size of @xmath140au .",
    "the disk wind propagates into the infalling envelope , and thus it sweeps and collects a larger fraction of the infalling matter .",
    "finally , a large fraction of the swept material is expelled from the host cloud .",
    "thus , the outflow significantly affects the final protostellar mass or star formation efficiency .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the mass accretion rate onto the protostar and the protostellar mass against the time after protostar formation @xmath141 . here",
    ", we describe the time after the protostar formation as @xmath141 , which is defined as @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the elapsed time after the cloud begins to collapse ( or the calculation starts ) , and @xmath144 is the protostar formation epoch and is listed in table  [ table:1 ] . in each model , the gas density exceeds @xmath145 , and the protostar forms @xmath146 after the cloud begins to collapse ( table  [ table:1 ] ) . note that model n39 shows no continuous collapse and no protostar appears ; this is because the initial cloud density for model n39 is too high to induce continuous collapse . in our models , since the gas becomes adiabatic at @xmath147 (  [ sec : setting ] ) , the initial cloud density ( @xmath148 ) for model n39 is very close to this critical value @xmath149 . as a result ,",
    "model n39 shows repeated contraction and expansion around the initial configuration , not continuous collapse .",
    "below , we describe only the models showing protostar formation ( n35 , n06 , n36 , n07 , n37 , n08 , n38 , n09 ) and do not mention model n39 again .    as described in ",
    "[ sec : sink ] , we removed the gas having a number density of @xmath145 in the region @xmath150au from the computational domain .",
    "we regarded the removed gas as the accreted mass onto the protostar and estimated the mass accretion rate in each time step .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows that , in each model , the mass accretion rate is as high as @xmath151 just after protostar formation ( @xmath152yr ) . in theoretical analyses ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is defined as @xmath153 , where @xmath36 is a numerical factor ( e.g. , @xmath154 in @xcite , @xmath155 in @xcite ) .",
    "since gas clouds have temperatures of @xmath56k ( @xmath156 ) , the accretion rate in the main accretion phase is @xmath157 .",
    "thus , the accretion rate derived in our calculations corresponds well to the theoretical expectation .",
    "then , in each model , the mass accretion rate gradually decreases with time , to @xmath158 at @xmath159 and @xmath160 at @xmath161 .",
    "thus , gas accretion almost halts and the protostar rarely increases in mass at @xmath162 . as shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] , all models show a qualitatively and quantitatively similar mass accretion rate trend when the mass accretion rate onto the protostar is normalized by the freefall timescale of the initial cloud",
    ". however , since the real ( or dimensional ) time of the freefall timescale depends on the initial cloud density ( or the initial cloud mass ) , the duration of the main accretion phase is different in models with different cloud masses .",
    "a cloud with a larger mass ( or lower density ) has a longer duration of the main accretion phase .",
    "for example , model n35 with @xmath163 has the mass accretion of @xmath164 for @xmath165yr , while model n09 with @xmath166 has that only for @xmath167yr .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] also shows that the protostar formed in a massive cloud is more massive than that formed in a less massive cloud .",
    "this is because the massive cloud has a longer gas accretion phase , so the protostar has enough time to acquire sufficient mass and evolves into a relatively massive star .    in figure",
    "[ fig:5 ] , the mass accretion rate oscillates in models having an initially massive cloud .",
    "this is caused by a non - axisymmetric structure appearing in the circumstellar disk . since the circumstellar disk is more massive than the protostar just after protostar formation @xcite ,",
    "a non - axisymmetric or spiral structure develops owing to gravitational instability .",
    "such structure effectively transfers angular momentum outward and intermittently promotes mass accretion onto the protostar . as a result , these models show time variability in the mass accretion rate @xcite . in figure  [ fig:5 ] , models n35 , n06 ,",
    "n36 , n07 and n37 show time variability in the mass accretion rate .      the mass of the protostar , circumstellar disk , protostellar outflow , and infalling envelope are plotted against time after protostar formation @xmath141 in figure  [ fig:6 ] .",

    "the circumstellar disk mass is estimated according to the formula in @xcite . to estimate the outflowing gas @xmath168 , we integrated the gas with velocity @xmath169 for the entire computational domain and subtracted the gas swept by the protostellar outflow outside the host cloud @xmath35 from the integrated mass . for later convenience , we divide the outflowing mass into two parts , @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the mass ejected from the host cloud , and @xmath172 is the outflowing mass having @xmath173 inside the host cloud ( @xmath111 ) . to calculate the mass of the infalling envelope",
    ", we calculated the total mass @xmath174 inside the host cloud ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "then , we subtracted the disk mass @xmath175 and the outflowing mass @xmath172 in the @xmath34 region from the total mass , @xmath176 in our models , the sum of the protostellar mass , circumstellar mass , and infalling envelope mass is not conserved inside the host cloud ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) because part of the gas is ejected from the host cloud by the protostellar outflow .",
    "however , we confirmed that the sum of the total mass and the protostellar mass is well conserved before the outflow reaches the boundary of the host cloud , as described in  [ sec : setting ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows that , in each model , the mass of the infalling envelope decreases to @xmath177 at @xmath161 ( table  [ table:2 ] ) , where @xmath178 is the initial cloud mass .",
    "thus , the mass of the infalling envelope is depleted and the main accretion phase is almost over by this epoch .",
    "note that , in figure  [ fig:6 ] , we subtracted the time ( @xmath144 ) until the protostar forms from the time ( @xmath143 ) after the cloud begins to collapse .",
    "thus , at the epoch @xmath88 , indicated by the arrow in figure  [ fig:6 ] , a longer time than @xmath88 has passed since the cloud begins to collapse ( table  [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that almost all the gas has already fallen onto the center of the cloud at this epoch @xmath179 , because the gas falls onto the cloud center in several times freefall timescale @xcite and the freefall timescale at the cloud boundary ( @xmath88 ) has already passed by this epoch .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] also indicates that the circumstellar disk mass dominates the protostellar mass just after protostar formation in each model .",
    "the circumstellar has been reported to originate from the first core @xcite , which is about 10 - 100 times more massive than the protostar at the protostar formation epoch @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the circumstellar disk is inevitably more massive than the protostar in the early main accretion phase because the first core evolves directly into the circumstellar disk after protostar formation . in the later main accretion phase , however , in some models , the protostellar mass dominates the circumstellar disk mass . in the initially massive clouds ( models n35 ,",
    "n06 , and n36 ) , the protostellar mass continues to increase , whereas the circumstellar disk mass gradually decreases until the end of the main accretion phase .",
    "in addition , in models n35 and n06 , the protostar becomes more massive than the circumstellar disk for @xmath180 .",
    "the massive circumstellar disk becomes gravitationally unstable and tends to exhibit a non - axisymmetric structure that can transfer angular momentum outward ; the gas in the circumstellar disk effectively falls onto the protostar .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate onto the protostar from the circumstellar disk dominates the accretion rate onto the circumstellar disk from the infalling envelope , and the mass of the disk begins to decrease .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the density distribution on the equatorial plane around the center of the cloud at @xmath181 for models n35 , n06 , n08 and n09 .",
    "the figure shows that a rotating disk with a size of @xmath182au forms around the center of the cloud by this epoch .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:7]_a _ , two clumps appear in model n35 , in which fragmentation occurs in the circumstellar disk about @xmath165yr after protostar formation . in models n35 and n06 , the circumstellar disk is rather massive in the early main accretion phase .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] , the circumstellar disk has a mass of @xmath183 in model n35 and @xmath184 in model n06 in the early main accretion phase for @xmath185 .",
    "such a massive disk becomes gravitationally unstable and tends to develop a non - axisymmetric structure and show subsequent fragmentation , as seen in figure  [ fig:7]_a_. although model n06 shows no fragmentation until the end of the calculation , non - axisymmetric ( or spiral ) structure develops in the circumstellar disk , as seen in figure  [ fig:7]_b_. the circumstellar disk mass begins to decrease after the non - axisymmetric structure develops because such structure transfers angular momentum outward , and the gas in the circumstellar disk effectively falls onto the central protostar .",
    "finally , the protostellar mass dominates the circumstellar disk mass in the later main accretion phase for models n35 and n06 ( fig .  [ fig:6 ] ) . for model n36 ,",

    "this is because the size of the circumstellar disk is not sufficiently larger than the jeans length , and the disk is stable against gravity ( @xcite ) . as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] , model n08 has an almost axisymmetric structure .",
    "thus , angular momentum transfer due to non - axisymmetric structure is not so effective , and a massive disk remains until the end of the main accretion phase .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:6 ] , for model n09 , the protostar becomes more massive than the circumstellar disk just after the protostar formation , and the protostellar mass dominates the circumstellar disk mass by the end of the calculation .",
    "since model n09 has no sufficient cloud mass at the initial state , the circumstellar disk can not increase its mass significantly by gas accretion .",
    "for this model , the protostar and the circumstellar disk just after the protostar formation has a mass of @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "thus , the sum of protostellar and circumstellar disk masses ( @xmath189 ) is comparable to the initial cloud mass ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "therefore , mass accretion onto the circumstellar disk from the infalling envelope rapidly declines immediately after the protostar formation . on the other hand ,",
    "the protostar gradually increases its mass by the mass accretion from the circumstellar disk .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] indicates that , in each model , the protostellar mass rapidly increases for @xmath191 , and slightly increases for @xmath192 . for @xmath162 ,",
    "the protostellar mass rarely increases because the infalling envelope is almost depleted by this epoch . to compare the protostellar mass evolution among models , the time averaged mass accretion rate for @xmath193",

    "for all models , the averaged mass accretion rates are in the range of @xmath196 .",
    "the difference of the mass accretion rate among models is only a factor of about 2 .",
    "thus , a protostar has a similar accretion history when the protostellar evolution is normalized by the freefall timescale of the initial cloud . in reality , however , initially massive cloud has a longer freefall timescale and longer duration of the main accretion phase .",
    "thus , the protostar formed in massive cloud has a greater mass at the end of the main accretion phase .      in the main accretion phase",
    ", the mass of the protostellar outflow dominates , or is comparable to , both the protostellar and circumstellar disk masses for models n35 , n06 , n36 , n07 , and n37 , as shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "this indicates that the protostellar outflow greatly affects star formation efficiency because it ejects a large fraction of the mass of the host cloud . in other words ,",
    "the protostellar outflow controls the protostellar mass or star formation efficiency in the star formation process as pointed by @xcite .",

    "is denoted by a white contour , inside of which radial velocity of the gas is supersonic ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] shows that the gas is strongly ejected from the host cloud by the protostellar outflow in any model .",
    "in addition , the outflow width ( i.e. , the horizontal length in the direction of travel ) is comparable to the radius of the host cloud ( @xmath199 ) , and thus , the outflow has a wide opening angle . at this epoch , on the cloud scale of @xmath33 ,",
    "the outflow has opening angles of @xmath200 ( n35 ) , @xmath201 ( n06 ) , @xmath202 ( n08 ) , and @xmath203 ( n09 ) .",
    "note that the opening angle continues to increase until it becomes comparable to the cloud radius . as a result ,",
    "the protostellar outflow with a wide opening angle sweeps up a large fraction of the infalling material and ejects it into the interstellar space .",
    "in addition to this swept material , a part of the mass in the circumstellar disk is ejected directly by the outflow .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] shows the ratio of the outflowing to infalling masses for models n35 , n36 , n37 , and n38 . to investigate outflow efficiency and mass ejection rate , we calculated the outflowing / infalling mass rate on the @xmath204 and @xmath205 grid surfaces . in each model",
    ", the @xmath204 grid covers the entire circumstellar disk , and @xmath206 grid has a size of @xmath207 times the disk radius .",
    "since the protostellar outflow is originally driven by the circumstellar disk , the mass ejected from the @xmath204 grid almost corresponds to the outflowing mass directly driven by the circumstellar disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass ejected from the @xmath206 is the sum of the outflowing mass directly driven by the circumstellar disk and the swept mass by the outflow that propagates into the dense ( or massive ) infalling envelope . according to @xcite , we estimated the outflow @xmath208 and inflow @xmath209 masses as @xmath210\\ , ds,\\ ] ] and @xmath211\\ , ds,\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath212 is the unit vector outwardly normal to the surface of the @xmath204 or @xmath205 grid .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] shows that the ratio of the outflowing to inflowing mass around the circumstellar disk ( @xmath204 , thin line ) has a peak of @xmath213 at @xmath214 .",
    "thus , the mass ejection rate is comparable to the mass infalling rate at this epoch .",
    "note that since the circumstellar disk and the outflow driving region are embedded in the grid of @xmath204 , the mass swept up by the outflow may be slightly included in the estimation of the outflowing rate .",
    "then , in all the models , the ratio in the @xmath204 grid gradually decreases with time .",
    "the ratio decreases to @xmath215 at @xmath216 and reaches @xmath217 at @xmath218 .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] also shows that the ratio of @xmath219 in the @xmath220 grid exceeds that in the @xmath221 grid for a short period after the protostar appears .",
    "thus , the outflowing mass ( rate ) increases with distance from the driving source .",
    "this indicates that a wide - opening - angle outflow sweeps up the infalling gas and ejects it toward the center of the cloud .",
    "especially , for @xmath180 , the rate in the @xmath206 grid is about 10 times larger than that in the @xmath206 grid .",
    "this indicates that the protostellar outflow collects the matter in the infalling envelope 10 times more massive than that directly blown away from the circumstellar disk . note that since the boundary of the host cloud is located more far away from @xmath206 grid , the outflow sweeps more matter in the infalling envelope to be ejected from the host cloud .",
    "the thick line in figure  [ fig:9 ] indicates that the outflow on a larger scale gradually decreases for @xmath222 and disappears in @xmath223 .",
    "thus , the lifetime of the outflow is about 10 times the freefall timescale of the center of the host cloud , or 3 - 5 times of the freefall timescale of the outer edge of the host cloud .",
    "the protostar forms @xmath146 after the cloud begins to collapse ( table  [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , the protostellar outflow continues to be driven by the circumstellar disk until the freefall timescale of the cloud boundary passes after the protostar formation .",
    "this is natural that the almost all the gas inside the cloud fall onto the circumstellar disk in @xmath88 ( figs .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] ) , and the protostellar outflow is powered by the mass accretion onto the circumstellar disk .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] shows the outflow length ( upper panel ) and width ( lower panel ) against the time normalized by the freefall timescale at the center of the cloud for all models .",

    "the outflow extends up to about 10 times the initial cloud radius except for model n09 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] upper right panel ) .",
    "the outflow in a massive cloud has a longer lifetime to reach a greater distance from the protostar because a massive cloud has a longer freefall timescale and the outflow continues to be driven on @xmath226 times the freefall timescale .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig:10 ] indicates that the outflow also expands in the horizontal direction and becomes comparable in size to the host cloud radius @xmath199 .",
    "the outflow propagates into the infalling envelope along the magnetic field lines .",
    "although the magnetic field lines that drive the outflow are strongly bundled around the circumstellar disk , they spread with the distance from the center of the cloud up to @xmath227 because they are connected to the cloud scale lines .",
    "therefore , the outflow width also spreads in the horizontal direction and has an opening angle of @xmath228 on the host cloud scale .",
    "figure  [ fig:11 ] shows the evolution of the collimation factor of the outflow , which is defined as @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the length and width of the outflow , respectively .",
    "the figure indicates that the collimation factors remain @xmath232 for @xmath233 .",

    "the collimation factors reach @xmath235 . as seen in figure  [ fig:2 ] , although the outflow has a wide - opening - angle in the early main accretion phase , it is a very well collimated in the later main accretion phase . in addition , the width of the protostellar outflow reflects the size of the host cloud .",
    "thus , we can acquire information on the prestellar cloud core from the size and width of the protostellar outflow .",
    "to investigate the evolution of the outflow strength , we estimated the outflow momentum , which is defined as @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the outflow velocity . figure  [ fig:12 ] upper panel shows that the evolution of the outflow momentum against the elapsed time after the outflow appears @xmath238 , which is defined as @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the time at the moment of the outflow appearing .",
    "this panel indicates that an initially massive cloud has a larger outflow momentum .",
    "the outflow momentum increases for @xmath241 after the outflow appears , whereas it gradually weakens for @xmath242 .",
    "since the main accretion phase is almost over at @xmath243 , the outflow momentum has a peak at @xmath243 . at its peak ,",
    "the outflow momentum is @xmath244kms@xmath23 , depending on the initial cloud mass .",
    "the outflow originating from an initially massive cloud has a larger momentum and reaches further , while that from an initially less massive cloud has a weak momentum and disappears in a short duration .",

    "thus , the observation of outflow momentum well agrees with simulation results .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] , since the mass accretion rate at this epoch ( @xmath257 ) decreases to @xmath262 , the protostar can not acquire additional mass from the infalling envelope after this epoch .",

    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig:13 ] also shows that the mass of the protostellar outflow is larger than or comparable to the protostellar mass for @xmath266 .",

    "a less massive disk appears in a less massive cloud and is stable against gravity .",
    "in such a disk , angular momentum is transferred by magnetic effects such as magnetic braking and protostellar outflow and the mass accretes steadily onto the protostar @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig:14 ] shows that both the lower and upper limit of the star formation efficiency tend to decrease as the initial cloud mass increases .",
    "this is because , in a massive cloud , a protostellar outflow with a wide - opening - angle can sweep up a large amount of mass and eject it into the interstellar space .",
    "the red line in the lower panel of figure  [ fig:13 ] shows that the mass ejection rate owing to the protostellar outflow increases with the initial cloud mass . the mass ejection rate owing to the protostellar outflow exceeds @xmath286 in a relatively massive cloud .",
    "thus , at most half of the initial cloud mass can be ejected by protostellar outflow .",
    "since we can not estimate the mass ratio finally falling onto the protostar from the circumstellar disk , the realistic value of star formation efficiency is unclear .",
    "however , our result indicates that the protostellar outflow contributes greatly to the protostellar mass and star formation efficiency in a single cloud core .      in this study",
    ", we fixed the initial ratio of magnetic and rotational energies to the gravitational energy in each cloud .",
    "as described in  [ sec : sfe ] , star formation efficiency depends strongly on outflow properties , which in turn depend on magnetic and rotational energies of the initial cloud .",
    "thus , the star formation efficiency described in  [ sec : sfe ] may be just a lower limit because we selected magnetic and rotational energies most suitable for driving a powerful outflow according to the previous studies @xcite .",
    "for example , when a very weak ( negligible ) magnetic field exists in the initial cloud , only a weak ( or negligible ) outflow appears , and higher star formation efficiency is realized without significant mass ejection from the host cloud .",
    "even with a slower rotation rate , a weak outflow realizes higher star formation efficiency .",
    "in addition , the initial strength of the magnetic field affects the collimation of the outflow : outflow appearing in a weakly magnetized cloud has a relatively narrow opening angle @xcite .",
    "thus , to investigate the relationship between star formation efficiency and protostellar outflow in more detail , we may need to investigate cloud evolution in terms of magnetic and rotational energies .",
    "however , such calculation incurs a very high cpu cost . in this study",
    ", we showed that the protostellar outflow can suppress star formation efficiency to @xmath287% ( @xmath288 including the circumstellar disk ) at most .",
    "this indicates that the protostellar outflow greatly affects star formation , and we need to consider the protostellar outflow in order to investigate the protostellar mass .",
    "we will investigate cloud evolution with a large parameter space in the future .    in this study , to realize long - term evolution of the cloud until the end of the main accretion phase , we adopted sink treatment instead of resolving the protostar and the structure around it ( @xmath289au ) .",
    "however , as described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , another flow component called the high - velocity jet may appear around the protostar .",
    "since the high - velocity jet is well collimated @xcite , it can not sweep up a large amount of mass in the infalling envelope when it propagates into the host cloud .",
    "however , about 10% of the accreting matter is expected to be ejected by the collimated jet .",
    "thus , the high - velocity jet may further lower star formation efficiency during the star formation",
    ". however , the mass ejected by the jet may rarely affect the star formation efficiency , because a large fraction of the cloud mass is already ejected by the outflow in the early stage of the star formation .",
    "we need a considerably higher spatial resolution to include the effect of high - velocity jets to estimate the star formation efficiency in more detail .",
    "in this study , we investigated the impact of protostellar outflow on the star formation process .",
    "we constructed nine models with different initial cloud masses in the range of @xmath63 , and calculated the cloud evolution until the cloud mass is depleted . in the calculation , without artificially inputting outflow ( momentum ) to the computational domain as seen in any other studies , outflow is naturally or automatically driven by the circumstellar disk . as a result of the calculation",
    ", we found that a large fraction of the initial cloud mass is ejected from the host cloud into the interstellar space by the protostellar outflow .",
    "thus , the protostellar outflow significantly affects the star formation process and determination of the star formation efficiency .",
    "the following results are obtained .",
    "the protostellar outflow continues to be driven by the circumstellar disk for about 10 times the freefall timescale of the initial cloud after the cloud begins to collapse .",
    "the final size of the outflow is different among models , because different models have different initial central densities and different freefall timescales . in each model , the protostellar outflow reaches @xmath224au far from the protostar in @xmath290 .",
    "when the outflow remains inside the host cloud , the outflow extends also to the vertical direction toward the direction of travel , because the outflow is anchored by large - scale ( host cloud scale ) magnetic field lines .",
    "after the outflow penetrates the host cloud and propagates into the interstellar space , it extends only in the direction of the travel keeping its width .",
    "thus , in this period , the outflow collimation improves to reach @xmath274 . before disappearing",
    ", the outflow has a length of 10 times the natal cloud radius and a maximum width comparable to the natal cloud radius .",
    "thus , we can expect natal cloud size ( or mass ) from the length and width of observed outflow .    in this study",
    ", since we did not resolve protostar itself , no high - velocity jet appears .",
    "however , outflow momentum and momentum flux derived in our simulation well agree with observations .",
    "this indicates that the outflow driven by the circumstellar disk is responsible for total outflow momentum , and high velocity jet rarely affects the star formation efficiency .",
    "in addition , it is expected that the entrained mass by the high velocity jet can be ignored to estimate the mass ejection from the host cloud , because observed outflow momentum can be explained only by the disk driven outflow .",
    "although the high velocity jet may promote the mass ejection further , a larger fraction of the mass can be ejected only by the outflow .",
    "the protostellar outflow can eject @xmath291% of the host cloud mass into the interstellar space .",
    "the mass ejection rate increases as the initial cloud mass increases ; a large fraction of the initial cloud mass is ejected in a massive cloud .",
    "this is because a massive cloud retains a large amount of the infalling matter even after the protostar formation , and outflow can sweep and collect a large fraction of the infalling matter when it propagates into the infalling envelope .",
    "thus , the protostellar outflow can suppress the star formation efficiency to @xmath292 .",
    "in addition , a massive circumstellar disk comparable to the protostellar mass remains even after the infalling envelope is depleted .",
    "although we need to calculate further evolution of the protostellar system to determine the star formation efficiency , the star formation efficiency of @xmath293% may be realized when ( a part of ) the circumstellar disk is blown away in further evolution stage",
