    "gaussian fitting is an excellent approximation for the low moments of the spectral line : integrated intensity ( zero moment ) and line centroid position ( first moment ) , even if the line profile is non - gaussian .",

    "observed non - gaussian spectral lines in flare euv emission , showing that many unblended lines were consistent with a line shape produced by a kappa rather than a maxwellian velocity distribution , in different flare regions .",
    "megakelvin flare temperatures produce spectral lines dominated by doppler broadening , and physically , such a line shape could be produced by ( 1 ) non - thermal ions of @xmath2 1 mev or ( 2 ) non - gaussian turbulent velocity fluctuations , providing a new euv diagnostic tool .",
    "non - thermal flare particles are usually detected by x - ray and gamma ray observations .",
    "most flares have x - ray bremsstrahlung emission from kev electrons , currently detected with the _ ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "only a small minority of ( typically ) large flares , e.g. sol2002 - 07 - 23 @xcite , have detectable gamma - ray line emission , produced by interactions between mev protons and heavier ions ( cf .",
    "* ) , and hence the properties and occurrence of such ions remain uncertain . accelerated ions with energies less than a few mev are almost impossible to detect with methods such as impact polarization or charge - exchange , that also require the presence of anisotropic ion beams , remaining inconclusive . but to assess the non - thermal ion energy content requires knowledge of this accelerated but low - energy component .",
    "ion kappa velocity distributions ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are routinely detected in space physics e.g. @xcite , but the high density flare environment ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) with thermalizing coulomb collisions is very different to the collisionless solar wind .",
    "if such distributions can exist in flare conditions , they could provide a novel diagnostic technique of solar flare ion acceleration unavailable using other methods .",
    "the presence of plasma turbulence might be an alternative explanation of observed solar flare non - gaussian spectral lines .",
    "excess line broadening , or the presence of broadening larger than expected from isothermal ion motion , is often detected during a flare e.g. , and likely produced by either turbulent magnetic fluctuations ( magnetohydrodyamic ( mhd ) turbulence ) or possibly by the superposition of unresolved flows .",
    "although , recent eis studies in active regions and cooler lines in flares showed some correlation between excess line width and directed doppler shifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , other notable observations : larger broadening of hotter lines and isotropy ( line broadening is seen for flares located at all heliocentric angles ) , might be consistent with magnetic fluctuations .",
    "other independent observations using x - ray imaging e.g. @xcite also show additional and independent evidence for mhd turbulence in the corona .",
    "further , a recent study in preparation ( kontar et al . , submitted prl ) shows that mhd turbulence can act as a crucial intermediary in the transfer of large amounts of energy from stressed magnetic fields to accelerated particles .",
    "however , irrespective of the cause , this excess turbulent motion is usually assumed to produce a gaussian line profile .",
    "indeed , plasma motions in a stochastic turbulent system and described by brownian motion will produce a velocity probability distribution function ( pdf ) that is normally distributed .",
    "however , large , sporadic motions far exceeding the mean , may lead to a velocity pdf with larger and heavier tails than that of a gaussian , and lead to euv line profiles better described by a kappa or lorentzian profile .",
    "for example , non - gaussian magnetic fluctuations are measured in space plasmas @xcite , with this intermittency likely to exist on smaller scales in particular .",
    "therefore , any evidence of non - gaussian line profiles connected to solar flare turbulence could provide an important observational constraint regarding the nature of the turbulence , vital for mhd and kinetic modelling , which is not available via other techniques .",
    "some possible causes of non - gaussian spectral line profiles , including turbulence and accelerated ions are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .    in this paper , we analyse flare sol2014 - 03 - 29t17:44 , that shows the presence of non - gaussian euv spectral lines . to date , sol2014 - 03 - 29t17:44 is one of the best observed flares in history . as well as observations with _",

    "we use the non - gaussian line profiles to determine the underlying velocity distribution .",
    "for the case of an accelerated ion population and following @xcite , a 3-d kappa ion velocity distribution @xmath20 of the first kind can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density associated with an acccelerated ion distribution and @xmath23 is a maxwellian thermal velocity at temperature @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 the boltzmann constant and @xmath26 the ion mass ) , and @xmath27 is the gamma function .             to make the link to observed line profiles , we need to convert equation [ fv_3d ] to a 1-d line - of - sight velocity @xmath28 .",

    "the line shape becomes gaussian .",
    "also , if @xmath44 , the line profile is the same as a lorentzian .",
    "hence , a kappa line profile can be used as a general line fitting form that can cover the specific cases of both gaussian and lorentzian line profiles .",
    "a kappa distribution might also be used to describe a spectrum of velocities @xmath45 produced by plasma turbulence . in this case , the plasma velocity distribution ( excluding the ion thermal motions ) could be described by , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the plasma velocity , @xmath48 is a function dependent on plasma properties , @xmath49 is a characteristic speed of the turbulence and @xmath50 is a bulk flow plasma velocity .",
    "the overall velocity distribution would then be a convolution of @xmath45 with the ion velocity distribution , but the overall line profile and its non - gaussianity could still be approximated by a kappa line distribution .",
    "hence , regardless of the physical process , a kappa line profile is an excellent starting point for the detection and analysis of non - gaussian ion or plasma velocities .",
    "even if the kappa distribution does not describe all the underlying physics , it provides a mathematically convenient line profile for the determination of non - thermal / non - gaussian velocities from _ hinode _ eis data ( where more detailed fitting is not possible ) , providing a fitting function that can range from a gaussian to a lorentzian .",

    "there is no reason for the eis instrumental profile to be gaussian , although it may be extremely well - approximated as such .",
    "for example , the spectrometer might be expected to have an instrumental response closer to a @xmath63 function . to account for the possibility of a non - gaussian instrumental response",
    "we fit another convolved kappa - gaussian ( see equation [ iw ] in appendix [ app ] ) , where the kappa part is fixed to represent an instrumental profile with chosen @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the gaussian parameters are free to vary , representing a physical line profile .",

    "we discuss this in greater detail in appendix [ app ] and later in subsection [ inst_comp ] .            in figure [ fig3 ] ,",
    "the residuals for each spectral line are also shown .",
    "for the chosen line , the residuals clearly show that the kg1 model is a better fit for the line , as indicated by the low @xmath80 value .",
    "this is particularly noticable around the peak and the wings of the line , where the kg1 residuals are very close to zero ( values within @xmath812 ) , compared to the fixed kg2 and sg residuals ( values within @xmath814 ) .",
    "again , for the chosen line , the kg1 residuals show that this model is a better description of the line than a gaussian ( sg ) , for all wavelengths covering the line profile ( again the kg1 residual values are within @xmath812 ) .",
    "we perform two line profile studies .",
    "the initial study fits , with kg1 , kg2 and sg functions , lines that satisfy the following two criteria :    1 .",
    "lines must have an absolute value of skewness less than 0.08 .",
    "the estimated noise level ( calculated as the standard deviation of the ratio of the intensity errors to intensity for each line ) for the line must be below 9% and the ratio of the integrated intensity error to integrated intensity less than 0.9% .",
    "following the line fitting with kg1 , kg2 and sg profiles , we identify those fits where we are confident that kg1 is the best fit , according to the following extra criteria :    1 .",
    "the reduced @xmath52 values of the kappa - gaussian fits must be less than 5.0 . 2 .",
    "the reduced @xmath52 values of the gaussian fits must be greater than 3.0 . 3 .",
    "the ratio @xmath82 must be greater than 2.0 ( for both kg1 and kg2 ) .",
    "criterion 2 is used as a `` noise value '' , which we define as 100%@xmath83 ( for std = standard deviation ) . from the work in and by testing model lines with different levels of gaussian noise",
    ", we found that lines with a noise value less than @xmath710% were usually suitable ( i.e. small intensity error values ) for a line model comparison .",
    "the integrated intensity error to integrated intensity ratio of 0.9% was chosen by trial and error and by examining how this value changed for lines found to be either suitable or unsuitable for study .",
    "criterion 2 allows us to quickly remove a large fraction of unsuitable lines in each raster without examining each line in detail , since each map has a total of @xmath7660 lines .",
    "further , criteria 3 - 5 help to find non - gaussian line shapes and remove lines with larger errors that can be well - fitted by all models ( i.e. all producing low @xmath52 values ) , helping to pinpoint and only examine lines that have a definite non - gaussian shape . in particular , criteria 4 and 5",
    "are used to remove lines where the gaussian model has low @xmath84 since we want to look at ( a ) non - gaussian lines and ( b ) remove noisy lines well - fitted by any model .",
    "none of the regions contained warm pixels but four regions did contain warm pixels . in the initial analysis of section [ results ] warm pixels are included but they are removed in the further analysis of kg1 .",
    "we also varied the eis line intensities using the codes of @xcite that account for finite binning in wavelength before the lines are fitted .",

    "line widths @xmath87 are displayed as a ` gaussian fwhm ' for easy comparison with line widths found from gaussian line fitting . at this time , fits satisfying criteria 1 and 2 are located @xmath88within the 30% intensity contour and along the northern ribbon , and for , mainly within the 30% contour and close to the 10 - 20 kev and 25 - 50 kev x - ray contours .    for the kg1 fit ,",
    "the lowest values of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) are located at the edges of the source and along the northern ribbon .",
    "closer inspection of the actual line fitting for all fits shows that the high @xmath89 ( @xmath710 ) values close to the centre of the source are due to the line having a moving component not removed by the skewness condition ( the shape of some line profiles with a large moving component can lead to the line shape having a lower skewness than 0.08 ) .",

    "our analysis can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "non - gaussian line profiles consistent with kappa distributions of emitting ions were found during the flare , close to the flare loop - top , hxr footpoints and ribbons .",
    "lines exhibiting kappa profiles were situated further from the coronal source than the lines , and often in regions where hxr sources were previously observed .",

    "we considered the possibility that the observed non - gaussian line profiles result from the eis instrumental response .",
    "although we can not rule this out completely , we find that parameter trends for @xmath0 index and @xmath61 ( particularly for ) do not behave as we would expect if the instrumental response were non - gaussian .",
    "we will now discuss the possible origins of the results .",
    "though difficult to detect by other means , it is likely that protons and heavier ions are accelerated during the flare . in figure",
    "[ fig8 ] , we interpret the results as 1-d ion velocity distributions @xmath128 at a single time for ( @xmath107 ) and ( @xmath106 ) , obtained using the observed kg1 fit parameters and equation [ los_kap ] .",

    "the grey region denotes ion velocities outside of the maximum fitted ion velocity ( from @xmath133 ) , since the line fits were performed over a range of @xmath134   ( ) and @xmath135    ( ) , where @xmath39 is the line centroid position .",
    "the maximum fitted velocities for and are 250 km / s and 340 km / s .",
    "the red curve denotes the expected maxwellian ion velocity distribution at @xmath136 and @xmath137 , while the solid red line denotes the expected ion thermal speed .",
    "the expected thermal speeds of and are @xmath138 km / s and @xmath139 km / s respectively .",
    "the results ( at @xmath106 , the flare peak ) are particularly interesting since we can see the @xmath0 index increasing as we move away from the centre of the coronal x - ray source towards the centre of the source .",
    "this shows that the velocity distribution tends towards maxwellian further from the coronal x - ray source . in figure",
    "[ fig9 ] , we compare @xmath128 versus @xmath140 for one line and one line observed in the same spatial region at the same time ( @xmath107 ) . at high velocities , the distribution tends to a power law @xmath141 with power index @xmath142 .",
    "the high velocity part of @xmath128 is fitted with a straight line in log - log space and values of @xmath143 are shown on the figure legend , with the @xmath0 index values .",
    "the @xmath143 values are @xmath144 ( ) and @xmath145 ( ) . hence , in the same spatial region ( but not necessarily the same height ) , the emitting velocity distribution is further from gaussian than the velocity distribution .",
    "this is an interesting result since we might expect the cooler to lie at a lower height in the atmosphere than the hotter , and further from sites of acceleration for example .",
    "further , we can estimate ( using the fast ion thermalization equations taken from @xcite ) whether the inferred non - thermal ion distributions can exist in a flaring plasma .",
    "kappa distributions are routinely measured in the collisionless solar wind , but the flaring atmosphere is highly collisional with electron number densities of @xmath146 @xmath4 or greater . for fast ions where @xmath147 , ( for @xmath148 electron thermal speed and @xmath149 heavy ion thermal speed ) , colliding with a background electron ( e ) - proton ( p ) plasma , there are two dominant collisional regimes below and above a velocity @xmath150 given by @xmath151^{1/3}v_{t_{e}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath152 km / s and @xmath153 km / s for @xmath154 mk ( corresponding to ) . equation [ vel_c ] gives @xmath155 km / s . above @xmath150 , collisions with electrons are dominant but below @xmath150 , collisions with protons are dominant .",

    "it can be written as @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is a collisional parameter and @xmath176 is a diffusion coefficient related to the acceleration mechanism .",

    "the collisional drag force on heavy ions has a minimum for ion speeds below @xmath181 @xcite and a partial runaway could occur , giving a suprathermal tail of ions with velocities below @xmath181 .",
    "however , if we convert the estimated ion thermalization times @xmath167 to thermalization lengths using @xmath182 , then the thermalization of the observed ions will occur over distances of @xmath183 , for @xmath184 @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , if the line profiles are due to accelerated ions then they must undergo acceleration _ locally and continuously _ during the flare time of study .",
    "we also note that sol2014 - 03 - 29t17:44 had no observable gamma - ray line emission , so there is no evidence for mev ions .",

    "we have not performed a detailed _ rhessi _ spectroscopy analysis for this flare as it was not the purpose of the study but in comparison , the energies associated with electrons in large flares are usually of the order @xmath200 ergs .",
    "an alternative scenario for producing non - gaussian line shapes is that they originate in macroscopic velocity fields due to plasma turbulence .",
    "support for this possibility comes from the fact that all of the observed and lines are slightly red - shifted , indicating small bulk downflows - even in the corona - which could drive turbulence .",
    "an estimate using laboratory rest wavelengths for each line gives downflow speeds of @xmath20130 to @xmath20270 km / s , at nearly all times and locations .",
    "it is difficult to estimate an absolute rest wavelength since these high temperature flare lines ( particularly ) are not present in quiet sun regions . after trying to determine an absolute wavelength scale for the cooler line ( @xmath203 ) using a ` quiet sun ' region at the top of the raster at different times , we still find red - shift values of @xmath20110 to @xmath20240 km / s , with showing the larger shifts .",
    "even taking a rather large uncertainty of @xmath204 km / s in the inferred rest wavelength , small red - shifts are still present .",
    "this interpretation of the non - gaussian line profiles leads to the interesting possibility of a diagnostic for localised turbulence , which could have profound consequences for theories of flare particle acceleration .",
    "in this paper , we show that in many locations in a flare , the and line profiles observed by _ hinode _",
    "eis are inconsistent with gaussian spectral line shapes , and are better described by emission from a kappa distribution of ion velocities .",
    "we find that the line profile analysis of suitable unblended lines such as and can provide a powerful diagnostic for microscopic ( non - equilibrium ) or macroscopic ( turbulent ) ion velocities during a solar flare , that may help to constrain fundamental processes related to localised particle acceleration and/or turbulent magnetic or plasma fluctuations or flows .",
    "straightforward estimates of ion collisional timescales suggest that the required accelerated ion distributions , with energies below @xmath205 mev , can exist provided that they are accelerated close to where the euv line emission originates .",
    "also , the acceleration mechanism must have an acceleration time @xmath206 s , and must operate for the duration of the flare observations .",
    "although , not impossible , these are stringent conditions , suggesting that the alternative possibility , line profiles due to non - gaussian turbulent velocities is a more plausible physical explanation .",
    "this is also supported by the observation of small red - shifts at the sites of non - gaussian and profiles .",
    "if broadening is due to turbulence , the physical line profile is a convolution of two physical velocities : the ion thermal velocity and a non - gaussian spectrum of plasma velocities .",
    "further , since sol2014 - 03 - 29t17:44 is the second flare observed with non - gaussian line profiles , its disk location in comparison to the close to limb location of sol2013 - 05 - 15t01:45 studied in , is suggestive of near - isotropy more consistent with turbulent magnetic fluctuations rather than unresolved plasma flows .",
    "lastly , it is interesting to note that in many studies of excess broadening , the highest excess broadening occurs for lines formed at the highest temperatures . in this line profile study",
    "we find that although @xmath35 is generally higher at early times and for hotter ( for all fits ) , the least gaussian profiles ( i.e. the smallest @xmath0 values ) are found for the cooler fe xvi lines expected to exist at lower heights in the atmosphere .",
    "the line profile analysis used data from _ hinode _ eis with an instrumental broadening of 0.059    ( @xmath10 slit ) and a spectral pixel size of 0.022   , and this analysis pushes the limits of eis .",
    "we are as certain as we can be that the non - gaussian profile is not instrumental , however it can not be dismissed completely for eis .",
    "we suggest that the instrumental profile of future euv spectrometers is measured precisely well into the line wings , so that higher moments of the line shape can be found with confidence from future solar observations .",
