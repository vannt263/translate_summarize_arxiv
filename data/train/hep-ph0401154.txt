    "the grand unification theory ( gut ) is very attractive as an unified description of the fundamental forces in the nature .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the observed quark and charged - lepton masses and mixings , a lot of yukawa couplings are usually brought into the model .",
    "we think that the nature is simple .",
    "so it is the very crucial problem to know the minimum number of yukawa couplings which can give the observed fermion mass spectra and mixings .",
    "however , if the quark and lepton yukawa couplings are composed by only one matrix @xmath5 the ckm matrix must be diagonalized , these model is obviously ruled out for the description of realistic quark and lepton mass spectra .",
    "therefore , at the unification scale @xmath6 , we assume the yukawa coupling of up quark , down quark and charged - lepton ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are composed by two matrices , @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real numbers which can be associated with the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) . for example , in the so(10 ) gut model with one 10 and one 126 higgs scalars , the yukawa couplings of quarks and charged leptons are expressed in the following forms @xcite@xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are symmetric yukawa couplings . in the previous paper @xcite , eliminating @xmath14 and @xmath15 from eq.([eq90101 ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 these relations are realized at the gut scale , but each value of the yukawa couplings is given by the experiment at the weak scale @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we must investigate how the mass ratios and ckm matrix parameters change from @xmath6 down to @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we distinguish between the values at @xmath6 and @xmath18 by using the superscript `` 0 '' or not .",
    "because @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are symmetric at the unification scale @xmath6 in the model with one 10 and one 126 higgs scalars , they are diagonalized by unitary matrices @xmath19 ,",
    "@xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are diagonal matrices which are given by @xmath26 here , @xmath27(@xmath28 gev ) is vev of higgs , and it is divided into up and down quark ( neutrino and charged lepton ) in the ratio @xmath29 . using the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath30 which is expressed as @xmath31 , the relation ( [ eq82515 ] ) is rewritten as follows : @xmath32 we take a basis on which the up - quark yukawa coupling is diagonal in order to compare with the experiment values and obtain the independent two equations : @xmath33 ^ 2 } }     { { \\left\\ { { { \\mathop{\\rm tr}\\nolimits } \\left ( { h_q\\left ( \\kappa   \\right ) } \\right ) } \\right\\}^2    - { \\mathop{\\rm tr}\\nolimits } \\left\\ { { \\left ( { h_q\\left ( \\kappa   \\right ) } \\right)^2 } \\right\\ } } }   \\to 1 \\nonumber \\\\   b\\left ( \\kappa   \\right ) & \\equiv & \\frac{{\\left ( { m_e^0 m_\\mu ^0 m_\\tau ^0 } \\right)^2 } }    { { \\left ( { \\left ( { m_e^0 } \\right)^2   + \\left ( { m_\\mu ^0 } \\right)^2     + \\left ( { m_\\tau ^0 } \\right)^2 } \\right)^3 } }    \\frac{{\\left [ { { \\mathop{\\rm tr}\\nolimits }     \\left\\ { { h_q\\left ( \\kappa   \\right ) } \\right\\ } } \\right]^3 } }   { { \\det \\left\\ { { h_q\\left ( \\kappa   \\right ) } \\right\\ } } } \\to 1   \\label{eq1012 - 02}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is the following hermite matrix which is defined by the yukawa couplings of quark : @xmath35 if we find the @xmath36 which sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath39 simultaneously , the three yukawa couplings @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be unified into two matrices .",
    "however we do nt know precisely how to determine these data , especially quark masses . and above procedures depend on these ambiguities .",
    "so in this paper , we substitute the random numbers which becomes following normal distributions @xcite : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 for each mass and ckm mixing parameter 10,000 times . and",
    "we estimate the evolution effect about the values in eqs .",
    "( [ eq011901 ] ) - ( [ eq011902 ] ) from @xmath18 to @xmath6 by using of rge.@xcite in this work , we suppose mssm for @xmath43 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can make the masses of third generation positive real number .",
    "although the remaining masses are complex under the ordinary circumstances , we assume that all masses are real in order to simplify the problem . therefore , there are 16 combinations of the signs of the masses as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , we scan the range @xmath44 by changing @xmath45 from -100 to 100 at 2000 equal intervals .",
    "moreover , we get the maximum and minimum of @xmath38 on the line of @xmath44 by changing @xmath45 at 5000 equal intervals . because @xmath38 is continuous",
    ", there is the @xmath36 which sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath39 simultaneously when @xmath46 as explained in fig.2 . in this way",
    ", we draw the histograms in figs 3,4,5 and 6 which show the distribution of input values conforming to the requirements @xmath46 .",
    "the each summation of the conforming case is tabulated in table 2 after the 10,000 substitutions .",
    "expressed in another way , table 2 shows the number of dots in the white area in fig.2 . in fig .",
    "7 , each circle in the complex plane shows the value of @xmath36 to meet the requirement @xmath47 , and the total number of circle in each figure corresponds to the number in table 2 , obviously . from these figures and tables , it is understandable that the sign of @xmath48 is not important .",
    "perhaps the reason is that @xmath48 is very small , and it is almost negligible in comparison with other masses .",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed the probability that the following model will be realized without fine tuning .",
    "the random numbers which become normal distributions have been substituted for each physical value at @xmath18 .",
    "and we have taken the rge effect between @xmath18 and @xmath49 into consideration . in this way",
    ", the search for @xmath36 which sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 to 1 simultaneously has been repeated 10,000 times . by this way",
    ", we have arrived at three conclusions : ( 1 ) the probability that the model will be realized without fine tuning is about @xmath50 if we select the appropriate signs ( 14 ) or ( 15 ) of the masses .",
    "( 2 ) this probability will increase if the signs of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are same .",
    "this gives the suggestion to the texture model .",
    "for example , a model with a texture @xmath53 on the nearly diagonal basis of the up - quark yukawa coupling @xmath54 is denied because these model leads to @xmath55 .",
    "( 3 ) from fig.3-fig.6 , this probability will increase if we make @xmath52 somewhat larger or smaller than the present experiment value properly .    in the present paper ,",
    "we have demonstrate that the quark and charged lepton yukawa coupling can be unified into only two matrices .",
    "however , we have not referred to the neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixings . the neutrino yukawa coupling is given by @xmath56 concerning this problem , we have not been able to find the positive solutions within @xmath57 which is written by the paper @xcite for the present . however , since there are many possibilities for the neutrino mass generation mechanism , we are optimistic about this problem .",
