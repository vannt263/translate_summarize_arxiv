    "systematic uncertainties arise from the models used to determine the initial density and refractive index of both the quartz and the sample , as well as describing the behavior of the quartz under shock and release ( including the precompression corrections ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the initial density @xmath22 is a combination of the uncertainty in measuring the initial pressure p@xmath13 by ruby luminescence ( @xmath39 p=0.03 gpa independently of the initial pressure and in the absence of pressure gradients within the precompressed sample ) and the uncertainty in the static compression equation of states .",
    "similar reasoning apply to the refractive index . since the main contribution comes from the constant uncertainty in the initial pressure , as the precompression",
    "is increased from 0.1 gpa to a few gpa , the importance of these uncertainty sources strongly decreases .",
    "the reduction of the uncertainty on quartz shock and release behavior is the most important progress of the model described in this work compared to the previous analysis of early data on hydrogen and helium .",
    "in addition , the improved correction for the higher initial density contributes to more accurate data .",

    "[ fig : image1 ] ) . to determine the temperature from the measured thermal emission , we assume a grey - body approximation for the spectral radiance , i = a@xmath40(@xmath41 ) [ e@xmath42 - 1 ] @xmath43 where @xmath40(@xmath41)=@xmath40 is the emissivity given by ( 1-r ) , r the measured optical reflectivity , a is a system calibration constant that incorporates the transfer function of the optical system and the response of the detector .    inverting this expression to solve for temperature gives , t = t@xmath26 [ ln(@xmath40(@xmath44 a /i + 1)]@xmath43 , where t@xmath26 = hc/ @xmath45kt is a calibration parameter related to the wavelength of the spectrometer peak sensitivity ( t@xmath26 @xmath1 1.9 ev at @xmath45= 650 nm ) .",
    "since the temperature determination is made relative to the quartz reference , the temperature in the sample can be determined from the ratio of the signal levels observed in the quartz and the sample , such that the system calibration constant a drops out of the expression , t@xmath46 = t@xmath26 [ ln(e@xmath47 - 1)(i@xmath48/i@xmath49 + 1)]@xmath43 with i@xmath50=i@xmath51/(1-r ) , i@xmath51 being the analog - to - digital counts associated with the observed signal , and r being the reflectivity measured with the visar .    knowing the shock velocity in quartz , the temperature in quartz , t@xmath52 , has to be determined from the calibrated function t@xmath52(us ) .",
    "then , one can obtain the temperature t@xmath46 in the sample .",
    "the temperature along the principal hugoniot t@xmath52(u@xmath8 ) has been measured by hicks et al.@xcite ( black circles in figure  [ fig : tvsus ] ) and is well represented between 12 and 23 km / s by a power law : @xmath53    .",

    "we propose a simple parametrization of the shock temperature for precompressed quartz based on experimental data on fused silica ( 2.20 g/@xmath20 ) and stishovite ( 4.29 g/@xmath20 ) ( light blue circles and light purple circles in figure  [ fig : tvsus ] ) . the dft - md is found to capture well the experimental data for the three starting densities .",
    "so does the sesame eos@xcite at high pressure , once silica is considered fluid and dissociated .",
    "as it was done for the principal hugoniot in the pressure - density plane , several hugoniots at different densities are calculated and compared to estimate the shift in temperature expected with a higher initial density . the sesame model and",
    "the dft - md simulations give very similar results and trends .",
    "we observe that a simple density scaling allows us to describe the difference in shock temperature between the quartz hugoniot and either the fused silica or the stishovite hugoniot ( black curve in figure  [ fig : tvsus ] ) : @xmath54 given the reduced and sparse set of data a relative uncertainty on this correction @xmath55 seems reasonable : this allows the model to describe relatively well the experimental data for lower and much higher initial densities as well as the dft - md results .",
    "in addition to extracting the shock velocity from visar fringe pattern shifts we can also measure the reflectivity of the moving reflecting interface from the intensity of the fringes . in the case of a reflecting shock , the reflectivity ( at the wavelength of the probe laser ) is due to a mismatch of complex refractive index between the shock compressed material ( index n ) and the precompressed material ( index n@xmath13 ) : @xmath56 a relative measurement of the reflectivity of the shock front in the sample compared to the shock front reflectivity in the quartz reference can be obtained easily from the ratio of intensities of the visar fringes in quartz and in the sample .",
    "when the shock front is in the quartz , the measured intensity of the visar fringes i@xmath52 is given by : i@xmath52=i@xmath57r@xmath52(u@xmath46)f@xmath58 where i@xmath57 is the incident probe laser intensity at the shock front , r@xmath52(u@xmath46 ) is the calibrated reflectivity of the shock front in quartz and f@xmath58 is the unknown transfer function of the optical system .",
    "when the shock is in the sample , the intensity of the visar fringes is given by : @xmath59 where r@xmath46 is the reflectivity of the sample shock front .",
    "combining these two equations gives : r@xmath46=r@xmath52(u@xmath46)i@xmath46/i@xmath52 .",
    "a reflection at the quartz / sample interface can come from an index mismatch of the precompressed states and can be easily modeled knowing the influence of the precompression on the respective refractive index .",
    "it is usually less than 2% and it has been in this case neglected .",
    "this relative measurement allows for accurate characterization of the optical reflectivity of the shocked sample even in the presence of strong variations of the transparency of the back diamond anvil / window that can be caused by the interaction of the high - energy drive - laser with the diamond anvil cell target and the ablation plasma .",
    "the measured reflectivity can then be used to estimate the temperature using the grey body approximation .",
    "we show on figure  [ fig : rvst ] experimental data for shock reflectivity along three different hugoniot starting with fused silica@xcite , quartz@xcite and stishovite@xcite .",
    "a strong dependence in temperature is unveiled : the curves are almost indistinguishable . in particular the small difference between the quartz ( 2.65 g/@xmath20 ) and the stishovite ( 4.29 g/@xmath20 ) suggests that changes in the temperature dependence of the reflectivity onset induced by the slight density increase for precompressed quartz is most likely negligible given the experimental uncertainties .",
