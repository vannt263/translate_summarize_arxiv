    "determining the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the central problems in hadron physics . in particular , at low temperature ( @xmath0 ) and non - zero chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) , one may expect that quark matter has a fermi surface , which gives rise to an interesting complication ; if there is some attractive channel in the quark - quark interaction , the fermi surface becomes unstable and quarks form cooper pairs , leading to a color superconductivity ( cs ) with the color - gauge symmetry broken @xcite .",
    "since the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) of cs is expected to be small , it would be difficult to create the color - superconducting quark matter by heavy - ion collisions .",
    "so it is natural that people have exclusively considered neutron stars as a physical system to which cs may have a relevance .",
    "however , there is a possibility to obtain information on cs by heavy - ion collisions through possible _",
    "fluctuations _ of the pair field .",
    "in fact , it is known that in the ordinary superconductivity in metals , there exist fluctuations of cooper pairs even above the critical temperature where the pair condensate does not exist : such fluctuations affect various transport coefficients , which are experimentally observed@xcite . in the usual superconductivity in metals ,",
    "the pairing interaction due to the phonon exchange is so weak that the mean field approximation works well except in the immediate vicinity of the critical point . in other words ,",
    "the fluctuations become important only near the critical temperature . however , in the case of cs at intermediate densities , large fluctuations may survive even well above @xmath1 owing to the strong coupling which may be described by a low - energy effective lagrangian of qcd . if there are large fluctuations even well above @xmath1 , heavy - ion collisions on earth may have a possibility to be utilized to study the physics of cs through examining precursory phenomena of cs .",
    "-@xmath2 plane in our model .",
    "the solid and dashed line denote the critical line of a first and second order phase transition , respectively . ]",
    "we use the two - flavor nambu - jona - lasinio model in the chiral limit , @xcite @xmath3   + g_{c}(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma_{5}\\tau_{2 } \\lambda_{2}\\psi^{c})(\\bar{\\psi}^{c}i\\gamma_{5}\\tau_{2}\\lambda_{2}\\psi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the charge conjugation operator , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the second component of the pauli and gell - mann matrices representing the flavor su(2 ) and color su(3 ) , respectively .",
    "the phase structure of our model in the mean field approximation is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the dashed line denotes the critical line of the second order phase transition and the solid line first order phase transition .",
    "the tricritical point where the order of the chiral transition changes from the second to first order is located at about @xmath8  mev .",
    "now that the phase structure is determined , we investigate the @xmath0 dependence of the fluctuation of the diquark pair field in the wigner phase above @xmath1 ; we calculate the response of the pair field to an external one in the linear response theory . when an external field @xmath9 is added in the wigner phase , the induced pair field @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a particle - particle correlation function corresponding diagrammatically to fig .  2 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is still a function of imaginary time . by carrying out the analytic continuation ,",
    "we then obtain , what we call , the response function @xmath14 . here",
    "it should be noticed that the following equality holds @xmath15 on account of the self - consistency condition for the second - order phase transition of the diquark condensate at @xmath16 .",
    "this equality is the origin to lead to the various precritical phenomena for csc .",
    "the nature of the fluctuation to be discussed below will not be altered even when the phase transition is _ weak _ first order owing to the fluctuations of the gluon fields .     with @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath21mev ( a ) and @xmath22mev ( b ) .",
    ", width=340 ]     with @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath21mev ( a ) and @xmath22mev ( b ) .",
    ", width=207 ]    the strength of the fluctuation is given by the spectral function @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the spectral function at @xmath25 mev and zero momentum transfer ( @xmath26 ) is shown in fig .",
    "one can see a prominent peak moving toward the origin grows as @xmath0 is lowered toward @xmath1 as indicated by the arrow in fig .  1 . in the experimental point of view , it is interesting that the peak survives at @xmath0 even well above @xmath1 with @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the precritical region of csc is one to two order larger in the unit of @xmath1 than that in the usual electric superconductors of metals .",
    "the result for @xmath28 mev is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) ; one sees that although the growth of the peak becomes relatively moderate , the qualitative features do not change .",
    "the existence of the peak with the narrow width suggests an existence of a well - defined collective mode as an elementary excitation in the wigner phase .",
    "this can be examined by searching possible poles of the response function .",
    "the existence of a pole @xmath29 with given @xmath30 means that the pair field @xmath31 can be created even with an infinitesimal external field @xmath9 as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : res]);i.e .",
    ", the system admits spontaneous excitation of a collective mode with the dispersion relation @xmath29 .",
    "( one should notice that the gap equation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : critical ] ) implies that @xmath32 is a solution at @xmath16 , i.e. , there exists a zero mode at the critical point . ) the singular behavior seen in the spectral function near the critical point in fig .",
    "3 is caused by the presence of the zero mode .",
    "a numerical calculation shows that there indeed exists a pole in the lower half plane at @xmath33 .",
    "4 shows how the pole moves as @xmath0 is lowered toward @xmath1 for @xmath25 and @xmath34 mev at @xmath26 .",
    "one sees that the pole approaches the origin as @xmath0 is lowered toward @xmath1 .",
    "such a mode whose energy tends to vanish as the system approaches the critical point of a phase transition is called a soft mode .",
    "another characteristic feature of the soft mode is that the absolute value of the imaginary part @xmath35 of the pole is larger than that of the real part @xmath36 for both @xmath2 .",
    "this feature may have an important implication for an effective equation describing the dynamical phase transition for csc : the dynamical behavior of the order parameter near @xmath1 is well described by a non - linear diffusion equation like the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "such a soft mode gives rise to anomalous behaviors of several transport coefficients ; for example , an anomalous excess of the electric conductivity above @xmath1 which is known as paraconductivity ( pc)@xcite . the diagrammatic contributions to pc are known as aslamazov - larkin and maki - tompson terms , which are shown in fig .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that these diagrams can be regarded as a modification of the self - energy of gauge fields , i.e. , the gluons and the photons , which decay into dilepton pairs .",
    "this implies that photons and hence dileptons from the system can carry some information of the fluctuation of cs .",
    "we also notice that the pairing fluctuations can give rise to a pseudo - gap phenomena known in high-@xmath1 superconductivity of copper - oxides",
    ". it would be intriguing to pursue possible similarity of csc and high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "these are under investigations .",
