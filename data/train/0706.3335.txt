    "in the area of financial time series the black - scholes model is often used for modelling the behaviour of the price of stocks , exchange rates and other financial time series .",
    "this is also the basis for much of the literature on pricing of derivative financial instruments such as options .",
    "however it is considered to be a well - known fact that although the volatility is assumed to be constant in the black - scholes model , in practice it is varying .",
    "this has led to the investigation of more general models in which the volatility is allowed to vary .",
    "one can broadly distinguish between two types of generalizations .",
    "one is the type of model in which the volatility is varying over time and its dynamic behaviour is described by some stochastic process .",
    "a problem with such models is that it is generally difficult to solve the _ volatility estimation problem _ for such models : the calculation of the conditional density of the volatility at some point in time , given the observations up till that same point in time , is usually a difficult task for which there are no closed form expressions . in the literature there are several proposals to approximate the conditional density , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the other , second type of model that is used is the arch model and its generalizations ( @xcite , see also e.g. @xcite ) , as applied to financial time series .",
    "these models have the advantage that the volatility is again time varying , and the conditional volatility ( also called conditional heteroskedasticity in this context ) is in fact prescribed by the model as a deterministic function of the past observations . by construction the problem of estimating the stochastic volatility has been solved in these models .",
    "however one could argue that this is at the expense of a less transparent model for the underlying data generating process . in the present paper a model of the first type",
    "will be presented , however with the advantage that for this model the volatility estimation problem can be solved , as we will show .",
    "apart from the volatility to be time - varying another feature of financial time series that is often reported is that it has _",
    "fat tails_. in the literature there are many studies that try to deal with this phenomenon by specifying non - gaussian disturbances .",
    "this goes back to the work of  @xcite who suggested to consider the class of stable distributions as possible distributions for the disturbances .",
    "an important example of stable distributions is given by the cauchy distributions .",
    "more recent studies seem to favor other distributions , including student t - distributions ( cf e.g. @xcite p. 19 , @xcite ) . in",
    "the approach followed in the present paper all disturbances are allowed which have a _ rational probability density function _ on the real line .",
    "this includes the cauchy distributions and student t - distributions with odd number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact it is well - known that the gaussian distribution can be approximated by a student t - distribution of sufficiently high number of degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore in a sense the corresponding gaussian model is a limiting case of the class of models presented here .",
    "it should perhaps be stressed from the start that there is a price to be paid in the form of high complexity if one wants to use rational densities of higher ( mcmillan ) degree . from the point of view of complexity in fact",
    "the estimation problem is easiest when the disturbances have cauchy density . in a previous paper",
    "a matrix calculus was developed for performing various calculations with rational probability density functions ( @xcite ) and applied to a filtering problem for a class of linear dynamical models .",
    "here we extend this calculus and show how it can be fruitfully applied to the non - linear filtering problem of volatility estimation , in a specific class of stochastic volatility models .",
    "the main extension of the calculus concerns a state - space formula for the _ composition _ of a proper rational function ( which can be allowed to be a proper rational matrix function ) with a proper rational function , under some minor condition that is required to ensure the resulting ( rational ) function is again proper .",
    "it is shown that the conditional probability density functions for the state are all rational functions in this model class and we provide an explicit way to calculate these and hence solve the filtering problem exactly .",
    "however as the complexity of the resulting rational probability density functions increases very quickly over time , the exact filter can not be implemented practically , except during a short period of time .",
    "an important innovation in this respect is the application of an approximation method stemming from stochastic systems theory , called the sbt ( stochastically balanced truncation ) method .",
    "this method allows to find a lower order positive rational density function which differs at each point on the real line by at most a given prescribed percentage of the original rational density function . in an application we use a tolerance level of @xmath0 giving excellent results .",
    "( the bound used is well - known in stochastic systems theory and is based on the deep and elegant theory of hankel norm approximation ) . in the implementation of the filter one needs to switch between various representations of the rational probability density functions .",
    "numerically reliable methods are presented to perform these steps .",
    "the possibility to implement the various theoretical ideas in a numerically stable way is crucial for the success of the practical implementation and forms one of the key contributions of this paper to the practical usage of rational probability density functions in filtering problems .",
    "we provide the results of some applications to simulated data and to empirical fx ( foreign exchange ) data and present a number of conclusions .",
    "a number of the technical results used are collected in an appendix .",
    "stochastic volatility models that we will consider are of the following form : @xmath1 where for each @xmath2 the random variables @xmath3 take their values in the real numbers , and where @xmath4 is a real - valued , positive polynomial function of @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 are sequences of jointly stochastically independent real valued random disturbances with time - invariant probability density functions : for each @xmath8 @xmath9 has rational probability density function @xmath10 @xmath11 has rational probability density function @xmath12 the initial state @xmath13 has rational probability density function @xmath14 the parameter @xmath15 is a real number that will be assumed to be unequal to zero for ease of exposition . in financial applications ,",
    "the @xmath16 usually stand for the returns @xmath17 of some price process @xmath18    a number of remarks can be made about this model class .    1 .",
    "the family of rational probability density functions is a very rich class .",
    "it contains the stable class of cauchy densities , it contains the student distributions with odd number of degrees of freedom . under relatively mild conditions ,",
    "probability density functions can be approximated by rational probability density functions , as follows from results of the theory of rational approximation .",
    "it is well - known that the gaussian probability density functions can be approximated for example by the student t - distribution of sufficiently high number of degrees of freedom , therefore the gaussian case appears in a certain sense as a limiting case of our model class .",
    "2 .   the function @xmath19 is a positive polynomial , i.e. for all @xmath20 here this is required for technical reasons . in the literature",
    "one finds other positive functions as specifications for @xmath19 as well , for example an exponential function @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if desired one can approximate the exponential function on any given finite interval by a positive polynomial .",
    "generalization of the results presented here , to the case in which @xmath19 is a non - negative polynomial , i.e. for all @xmath22 is straightforward .",
    "the parameters in the model as well as in the rational probability density functions of @xmath9 and @xmath23 are assumed to be constants here .",
    "however they could be taken time - varying if desired .",
    "the resulting filter equations for that case form a straightforward extension of the filter equations presented in this paper .",
    "we consider the following nonlinear filtering problem : estimate at each time @xmath24 the volatility @xmath25 from the sequence of observations @xmath26 ( note that we will use the same symbols @xmath27 for the random variables and their observed values .",
    "this is to avoid complicating the notation any further .",
    "the interpretation of the symbols as random variables or observed values should be clear from the context ) .",
    "the solution of such a problem consists of finding for each @xmath24 the conditional probability density function of @xmath28 given @xmath29 and deriving the desired estimate of @xmath25 from this .",
    "let the conditional density of some random variable @xmath30 given @xmath31 be denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "the filter consists of a set of recursive equations by which one can calculate the conditional probability density function of the state @xmath28 given the observations @xmath33 the filter consists of a prediction step and an update step . in the prediction step one calculates the conditional density @xmath34 of @xmath35 given the observations @xmath31 starting from the conditional density @xmath36 of @xmath28 given @xmath37 @xmath38 here @xmath39 denotes convolution .    in the update step one calculates the conditional density of @xmath28 given the observations @xmath31 from the observation @xmath16 and the conditional density of @xmath28 given @xmath40 using bayes rule .",
    "suppose the conditional probability density function @xmath41 of @xmath28 given @xmath42 is known and the observation @xmath16 becomes available .",
    "the joint density of @xmath43 can be obtained from the joint density of @xmath44 by a change of variables : @xmath45 the inverse jacobian determinant of this change of variables is @xmath46 which is positive because @xmath19 is a positive polynomial .",
    "it follows that the joint density of @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 substituting @xmath49 we obtain the following expression for the density of @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 since @xmath53 it follows that + @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we may evaluate the likelihood as @xmath55 note that the value of the normalization constants @xmath56 easily follows from proposition  [ prop : ex ] without the need for explicit integration .    as shown in @xcite",
    "the convolution of two rational density functions is a rational function too .",
    "therefore it follows easily that the conditional density functions defined above will all be rational , given our assumptions ! a way to implement the filter using ideas from system theory will be presented in the next sections .",
    "the key idea is to identify rational densities with spectra of linear , dynamic , continuous time , finite dimensional systems .",
    "this allows us to use concepts and methods from systems theory ; for an overview cf , e.g , @xcite .",

    "we associate a rational function @xmath58 on the complex plane which is specified on the imaginary axis by @xmath59 note that @xmath60 is a rational function which is nonnegative and integrable on the imaginary axis .",

    "construct the realization of the spectral summand of @xmath222 using the convolution formula given in proposition [ prop : scaling+convolution ] , part ( ii ) , in appendix [ app : ratdensop ] .",
    "now , as soon as a new observation @xmath223 becomes available one can proceed to a new update step .",
    "the behaviour of the co - degree and the state - space dimension and mcmillan degree of the conditional densities in the filter can now be described .",
    "first consider the co - degree .",
    "let @xmath224 denote the co - degree of @xmath209 and @xmath225 the co - degree of @xmath226 we know that the co - degree of a rational probability density is even .",
    "let @xmath227 denote the degree of the polynomial @xmath228 then the rational function @xmath229 constructed above has co - degree @xmath230 because by assumption the probability density of @xmath212 is ( strictly ) positive , it follows that the co - degree of @xmath215 is @xmath230 hence the co - degree of @xmath36 is @xmath231 as non - zero scaling does not affect the co - degree and convolution of two rational densities leads to a rational density with co - degree equal to the minimum of the two co - degrees of the arguments of the convolution ( see the notes after proposition  [ prop : scaling+convolution ] in appendix [ app : ratdensop ] ) we find @xmath232 where @xmath233 denotes the co - degree of the rational density of @xmath234 this makes that the co - degrees of the conditional densities @xmath34 , @xmath235 are bounded by @xmath236 this will turn out to be important in the next section .",
    "now let us turn to an analysis of the state - space dimensions and the mcmillan degree .",
    "for the composition and convolution of two rational functions the state dimension of the output is the product of the respective dimensions of the inputs ( see propositions  [ prop : composition ] , [ prop : scaling+convolution ] ) whereas for the product the dimensions add up , see appendix  [ app : add+mult ] .",
    "therefore in each step the state dimension of the realization of the conditional densities tends to increase dramatically .",
    "( note that together with the result on co - degrees this suggests that the resulting conditional probability density functions will have a non - trivial numerator , even if one uses student - t or cauchy densities for the disturbances ) .",
    "theoretically it is possible that the resulting state - space realization is not - minimal , in which case the mcmillan degree would be smaller than the state - space dimension and a state - space reduction procedure could be applied . in practice",
    "we do not expect this to happen very often .",
    "however if this is the case _ approximately _ , one can profitably apply model reduction techniques , to keep the state - space dimensions manageable .",
    "we suggest to apply model reduction at each time step to approximate the high degree rational density @xmath34 by a lower degree rational density . this will be the topic of the next section .",
    "there are many possibilities for model reduction .",
    "the challenge here is that the approximant has to be nonnegative on the real axis . in terms of the corresponding spectral density",
    "this means that the approximant spectral density has to be nonnegative on the imaginary axis . in terms of the spectral summand",
    "this means that the approximant has to be positive real .",
    "one well known method to achieve this is the so called `` positive real balanced truncation '' technique , see e.g.  @xcite , which we will shortly explain here .",
    "note that the solution set @xmath160 contains two particular elements , namely the minimal and the maximal element , @xmath237 say , and it has been discussed in section  [ sec : rsum2rfac ] how to compute these elements .",
    "a state space realization @xmath238 $ ] of a spectral summand @xmath148 is called _ positive real balanced _",
    "iff @xmath239 holds .",
    "the @xmath240 s are called the _ positive real singular values _ of @xmath30 . since @xmath241 holds and since the squared singular values @xmath242 are the eigenvalues of @xmath243 it follows that these singular values are bounded by @xmath244 .",
    "furthermore it is known ( see @xcite , theorem 4.1 ) that @xmath245 and @xmath246 for all @xmath247 holds , where @xmath178 is the co - degree of @xmath248 .",
    "it is easy to see that a state space transformation @xmath238 \\rightarrow [ tat^{-1},tm , ct^{-1}]$ ] , where @xmath249 is a non singular matrix , transforms @xmath161 and @xmath250 as @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "therefore such a balanced realization may be obtained by the following procedure .",
    "suppose @xmath161 and @xmath162 are given and let @xmath253 and @xmath254 be some arbitrary factorization of these positive definite matrices .",
    "here @xmath255 denotes a square root of a positive definite matrix @xmath256 , i.e. @xmath257 .",
    "in addition we use the notations @xmath258 , @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "next let @xmath261 with @xmath262 unitary matrices , be a singular value decomposition ( svd ) .",
    "the state space transformation @xmath263 then gives the desired balanced realization , since @xmath264 let @xmath265 $ ] denote the balanced realization obtained by this procedure and let these matrices by partitioned as @xmath266{\\left [ \\begin{array}{c|c } { a }   &   { m } \\\\ \\hline { c }   &   { 0 } \\end{array}\\right ] } \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } t^{-1 } & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]= { \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc|c } { \\bar{a}_{11 } }   &   { \\bar{a}_{12 } }   &   { \\bar{m}_{1 } } \\\\ { \\bar{a}_{21 } }   &   { \\bar{a}_{22 } }   &   { \\bar{m}_{2 } } \\\\ \\hline { \\bar{c}_{1 } }   &   { \\bar{c}_{2 } }   &   { 0 } \\end{array}\\right ] } \\ ] ]    the _ ( positive real ) balanced truncated model _",
    "@xmath267 is then defined as @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is the order of the reduced order system @xmath267 , i.e. @xmath270 , @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",

    "is given : @xmath276 where @xmath248 and @xmath277 .",
    "let @xmath178 be the co - degree of @xmath58 . by the discussion above it follows that this bound is finite if and only if @xmath278 holds .",
    "furthermore note that for @xmath279 the reduced order spectrum @xmath280 also has co - degree @xmath281 , see  @xcite , theorem  6.1 .    from  ( [ eq : greenbound ] ) it is easy to derive an error bound for the corresponding probability density functions .",
    "for simplicity assume that @xmath61 is normalized , i.e. @xmath282 and thus @xmath283 is a pdf .",
    "let @xmath284 denote the approximation of @xmath285 and let @xmath286 denote the error bound on the right hand side of  ( [ eq : greenbound ] ) . from  ( [ eq : greenbound ] ) we obtain @xmath287 and thus @xmath288",
    "therefore it follows that @xmath289 it should be noted that in our experiments we observe that  ( [ eq : greenbound2 ] ) is only a rough upper bound for the `` integrated '' approximation error and thus ( [ eq : greenbound3 ] ) is a conservative upper error bound .    in our implementation of the filter a model reduction step is included after each prediction step .",
    "this means after we have computed a realization of the spectral summand of @xmath34 , we apply the above described scheme to get a realization of an approximant .",
    "this will be used instead of @xmath34 .",
    "the order @xmath269 of the reduced order model is chosen such that the above error bound  ( [ eq : greenbound3 ] ) does not exceed a given threshold @xmath290 .",
    "note that the co - degree of @xmath34 is bounded by the co - degree of @xmath291 and that the reduction step does not alter the co - degree !",
    "in this section we analyze the properties of the processes @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "in particular it will be shown , given some suitable assumptions , that @xmath292 is a white noise process and that @xmath293 is an arma process . the mean and",

    "note e.g. that the estimate of @xmath390 shows a significant bias especially for small @xmath390 and @xmath391 .",
    "however this is only a first rough estimation scheme and other enhanced estimates will be investigated in future .",
    "it has been mentioned in section  [ sec : filter ] that the filter is able to compute the likelihood .",
    "however the computation of the filter is presently too time demanding to implement a maximum likelihood estimation based on the filter .",
    "next we test the filter on some real world data .",
    "in particular we consider data which also have been analysed by  @xcite .",
    "the authors consider five exchange rate data series and study the empirical performance of stochastic volatility models .",
    "here we only consider the dollar / yen exchange rate data , which consists of @xmath392 weekly observations from 3 january 1973 until 9 february 1994 .",
    "the parameters of the model  ( [ eq : simmodel ] ) have been estimated by the method of moments as described in the previous section . here",

    "note that , since the stationary solution of the state @xmath28 is not rationally distributed as far as we know , we have simply assumed that @xmath13 has a scaled t - distribution with @xmath397 degrees of freedom and the scaling was chosen such that the variance of @xmath13 is equal to @xmath398 i.e. equal to variance of the stationary solution .",

    "the exact filter for a class of stochastic volatility models is derived .",
    "a standard stochastic volatility model in which the disturbances are gaussian and the volatility function involved is exponential can be viewed as a limiting case .",
    "the complexity of the exact filter increases in the sense that the matrices that are used to represent the rational probability density functions tend to grow quickly .",
    "an approximate filter is presented in which at each time step the conditional probability density function of the state , which is rational , is replaced by an approximating rational probability density function , using the sbt method ( stochastically balanced truncation ) . using a well - known error bound the approximating rational probability density function",
    "can be chosen such that on each point of the real line the relative error is less than a given percentage ( the tolerance level involved can be chosen by the user ) . in some simulated and empirical applications",
    "we find that using a tolerance level of as low as 2 percent still leads to an enormous reduction in complexity , keeping the order of the rational functions well within bounds that are considered tractable with modern computers .",
    "lower tolerance levels could also be achieved if desired , but then larger matrices will have to be handled .",
    "the model presented is very flexible , especially with respect to the specification of the probability density functions for the disturbances . here",
    "one can vary between very heavy - tailed disturbances ( with cauchy density for instance ) and less heavy - tailed disturbances ( with student - t densities that are approximating gaussian densities for example ) . in the applications in this paper",
    "we have stayed as close as possible to the traditional gaussian model .",
    "however the possibility of specifying more heavy - tailed densities seems one of the most interesting features of this class of models .",
    "exploring those possibilities is an interesting topic for future research .",
    "also valuation of financial derivatives in a market in which the asset price movements can be described by a stochastic volatility model of the type investigated here , is an interesting topic for future research .",
    "more generally the methodology of working with rational density functions in filtering problems in the way presented here could have a much wider range of applications , as the methodology is really general and flexible and numerically stable methods for various operations involved are now provided . preliminary experience with the methodology",
