    "after aging we started the observation of jump processes .",
    "to get sufficient statistics we used observation times for the detection of jumps from 1.25  ns at 1400  k to 2.5  ns below 1200  k. as definition of jump we use a rapid transit of an atom between two sites of residence .",
    "one can see from a direct inspection of the particle trajectories that in dense liquids or glasses such `` jumps '' are . not ballistic . for the cuzr system such",
    "a trajectory has been shown for a jump of a cu - atom over a nearest neighbor distance in refs .",
    "furthermore the amplitudes of short time excursions are very large which makes an unambiguous definition of jumps difficult .",
    "one method to detect atomic jumps is to study the `` inherent dynamics '' by quenching the system at given time intervals `` instantaneously '' to 0  k and then study the properties of the `` energy landscape '' .",
    "here we use a more direct approach and define jumps by differences between atomic positions averaged over vibrational times .",
    "this means we define jumps of an atom in terms of absolute coordinates and not relative to the neighbors of the atom .    as a first step",
    "we define for each time step and each atom an average atomic position by @xmath76 since this averaging is done for each time step @xmath77 is still , on the scale of the discretization by the simulation time step , a continuous function but is smoothed by averaging over the vibrations .",
    "an instantaneous jump would cause a steep ramp in @xmath77 .    for the detection of a jump we use two criteria .",
    "first , the instantaneous position of an atom must differ by a minimum cutoff length from the average taken at a previous time : @xmath78 we want to exclude from our jump detection those excursions where an atom has a large amplitude momentarily , but immediately returns to its old site .",
    "therefore , when the above condition is fulfilled we additionally compare average positions separated by the fixed time interval @xmath79 @xmath80 a jump at time @xmath81 is recorded when this difference for the first time exceeds a limit @xmath82 @xmath83 the corresponding atomic jump length is defined as @xmath84    the time interval between the start time of the averaging for the final configuration , @xmath85 , and the end time of the averaging for the initial configuration,@xmath86 is @xmath87    this method is rather cpu - time consuming since at each time step two averages have to be done for each atom .",
    "this is however necessary if one wants to get the necessary time resolution .    throughout the simulation we used the parameters @xmath88  ps , @xmath89  ps and @xmath90  nm .    the necessity of averaging the atomic configurations over given time intervals limits the accuracy of the method .",
    "if a jump is completed in the time interval , @xmath91 , its length will be measured correctly by eq .",
    "[ eq_jump ] . a longer `` jump time '' leads to a reduced apparent jump length . on the other hand a movement of the atom with constant velocity @xmath92 during the time",
    "@xmath93 would be detected as jump if @xmath94 .",
    "since averaging over typical vibrational times implies @xmath95 we do not expect this to be an important limitation .",
    "more serious is the limited resolution of rapid successive jumps .",
    "if two successive jumps are completed within the time interval @xmath91 they will be regarded as a single jump .",
    "if , however , the second jump happens near the end of the time interval it will be counted only partially .",
    "for example , should the second jump be the reverse of the first jump we might under some circumstances still record some shorter range jump , given by the sum of the forward jump and a fraction of the back - jump .",
    "on the other hand , if the first jump is rapidly followed by a successive forward jump , normally correlated with the first jump , we record an effective jump length which is too short .",
    "these two effects should approximately cancel for the investigated temperatures . for lower temperatures where the fraction of back - jumps increases",
    "it leads to an overestimate of the mean square displacement calculated from the jumps , compared to the exact value .",
    "once the jump criteria hold for a time step they will normally hold for a subsequent time interval . to avoid double counting , therefore after each jump , we introduce a dead time @xmath79 during which jumps are not counted .",

    "both experiment @xcite and simulation of either activation volume @xcite or isotope effect @xcite indicate that insufficient aging would , if anything , enhance the number of single particle jumps with their inherent length scale .    for the structure forming majority component zr , the jump length distribution is given by the product of two terms , an arrhenius term for the temperature dependence and a temperature independent distribution of jump lengths .",

    "we have related this to lacking thermalisation between jumps , a view supported by the correlation factors .",
    "the correlation factors are of order unity .",
    "this is a signature of diffusion by an inherent mechanism , as opposed to a defect ( quasi - vacancy ) mediated one which would lead to clearly smaller correlation factors .",

    "it increases strongly with temperature .",
    "such correlation factors @xmath161 are known to result when the time between jumps no longer allows for thermalisation .",
    "it indicates , in this respect , the transition from jump - like motion to flow .    from the contribution of the different jump length to the mean square displacements",
    "it is obvious that long distance jumps only play a minor role in zr diffusion .",
    "their role is greater for cu where at @xmath104 jumps over more than 0.2  nm contribute more than 30% . from direct inspection of individual jumps",
    "one sees , that in the usual chain of collectively jumping atoms cu - atoms will show the largest displacements . at the higher temperatures ,",
    "often more than one cu atom jumps over a nearest neighbor distance .",
    "the replacement chains observed in the early work @xcite are a special case of this scenario .",
    "the absence of a preferred jump length might , prima facie , be taken as a contradiction to the time evolution of the van - hove self correlation function where , in the undercooled liquid , clearly a secondary peak at the nearest neighbor distance evolves .",
    "one of the authors showed earlier for the same material that the time evolution of the van - hove self correlation function for cu near @xmath162 can be reproduced by a model comprising only nearest neighbor jumps and a residue of short distance jumps , called flow - like motion @xcite . for cu an apparent activation energy of 850  mev , in good agreement with the present value of 820  mev ,",
    "was given .",
    "combining this and the present results one cane conclude that the secondary peak in the van - hove function indicates preferred resting positions for the cu - atoms in the zr - matrix which is rigid on the time scale of the cu diffusion .",
    "a similar conclusion was arrived at for the lennard - jones system from the energy landscape picture @xcite when the dynamic heterogeneity creates a sufficiently rigid matrix of immobile particles .",
    "diffusion becomes dominated by transitions between these minima , a connected network of minima is formed @xcite or `` coarse graining '' occurs @xcite .",
    "the strongly different diffusivities of the present system enhance the effect and are an additional source of `` metabasins '' @xcite .",
    "the diffusion of the cu in the deeply undercooled liquid and even more in the glass has features of a diffusion between `` traps '' .    in the previous work @xcite , as the temperature is lowered , an increase in jump reversal",

    "in summary we calculated the diffusion of cu and zr above and below the glass transition temperature .",
    "different to the commonly studied lennard - jones system cu shows in the undercooled liquid a strongly enhanced diffusivity , compared to the majority component zr .",
    "we think that this effect is related to the weaker coupling between the two components in the present system which is seen also in the reduced enthalpy of fusion .",
