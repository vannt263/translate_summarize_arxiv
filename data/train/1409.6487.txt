    "eccentric discs , in which the dominant motion consists of elliptical keplerian orbits , occur in a wide variety of astrophysical situations .",
    "for example , an eccentric gaseous disc is formed directly when a star ( or a giant planet ) evolves , through scattering or secular interaction , on to an orbit that closely approaches the galactic centre ( or the host star ) , and is tidally disrupted ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ; such a process might be responsible for the gas cloud g2 near sgr a@xmath1 in the galactic centre @xcite .    in an eccentric binary star",
    ", a circumstellar or circumbinary disc acquires a forced eccentricity from the binary orbit via secular gravitational interaction .",
    "the importance of this for planet formation in binary stars has been recognized @xcite .",
    "even if the binary orbit is circular , certain mean - motion resonances can allow a free eccentricity of the disc to grow , initially exponentially @xcite .",
    "these effects can of course occur in non - stellar binaries such as binary black holes with accretion discs @xcite , planet ",
    "satellite systems with planetary rings @xcite and protoplanetary systems . whether planet ",
    "disc interactions lead to eccentricity excitation @xcite depends on the dynamics of eccentric discs , because of the strong coupling between the planet and the disc .    even in the absence of an orbiting companion ,",
    "a disc may become eccentric through an instability of the circular state , such as viscous overstability @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the naive expectation that viscosity tends to circularize a disc , viscous overstability may explain the eccentricity of decretion discs formed around rapidly rotating be stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in eccentric binaries the forced eccentricity of the disc is locked to that of the binary and",
    "may not be easily detectable .",
    "however , discs with a free eccentricity precess as a result of their pressure and any gravitational influences that cause a departure from keplerian motion .",
    "this is the generally accepted explanation of the superhump phenomenon in the su uma class of dwarf novae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the accretion disc expands sufficiently during superoutbursts to encounter the 3:1 resonance with the binary orbit and becomes eccentric .",
    "( some other systems exhibit steady accretion and permanent superhumps . )",
    "the elliptical outer rim of the disc in oy car was measured by @xcite through the variation of eclipses of the hot spot .",
    "[ for a critical analysis of observational evidence for eccentric discs in su uma stars from a particular standpoint , see @xcite . ]",
    "recently , _",
    "kepler _ has been used to observe superoutbursts and superhumps with much greater accuracy @xcite . in dwarf",
    "novae the optical emission is modulated at the frequency at which the disc precesses in the frame that rotates with the binary orbit , owing to the interaction between the eccentric mode and the tidal deformation .",
    "related phenomena are also reported in low - mass x - ray binaries , although the radiative mechanisms are different @xcite .",
    "several theoretical and computational approaches have been taken to the study of eccentric discs .",
    "one is to try to generalize the classical theory of viscous accretion discs to allow for orbits of arbitrary eccentricity @xcite .",
    "these analyses , of which the last is by far the most general , aim to derive evolutionary equations for the shape and mass distribution of eccentric discs due to viscous and other internal stresses .",
    "earlier , equations governing the evolution of narrow and slightly eccentric planetary rings were formulated by @xcite .",
    "a separate body of theoretical work relates to eccentric collisionless stellar discs in galactic nuclei , notably m31 @xcite .",
    "small eccentricities are governed by linear equations which can be derived through a perturbation analysis of a circular disc .",
    "this approach has been taken by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the broad conclusion of this work is that eccentricity can propagate through a disc by means of pressure and self - gravity , as a slow one - armed density wave , while viscosity causes it to diffuse ( except in cases where it is excited by viscous overstability ) .",
    "differential apsidal precession due to the rapid rotation of the central object , relativistic effects , self - gravity of the disc or the presence of orbiting companions can be important , as can three - dimensional effects due to the vertical structure and oscillation of the disc .    numerical simulations of eccentric discs have mainly been carried out using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , which readily produces eccentric discs in circular binary stars with mass ratios typical of su uma stars @xcite .",
    "more recently , grid - based simulations have also found the development of eccentric discs in the presence of a planetary or stellar companion",
    ".    found that eccentric discs are hydrodynamically unstable in the absence of viscosity .",
    "the instability is three - dimensional and takes the form of a parametric resonance of inertial waves , as also occurs in tidally distorted discs @xcite and in the classic elliptical instability of flows with non - circular streamlines @xcite .",
    "a related phenomenon occurs in warped discs @xcite",
    ". carried out numerical simulations of the instability of eccentric discs in the absence of vertical gravity and found that it led to subsonic turbulence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : large ] we describe the geometry of an eccentric disc and recall the properties of the orbital coordinates defined by @xcite .",
    "we formulate the hydrodynamic equations in this coordinate system and obtain the evolutionary equations for an eccentric disc in terms of orbital averages of force and stress components . in section  [ s : local ] we derive a local model of an eccentric disc , which will be useful for analytical and computational studies of instabilities and turbulence in eccentric discs . in section  [ s : laminar ]",
    "we consider the simplest hydrodynamic solutions of this local model , which are non - hydrostatic and necessarily involve a vertical oscillation of the disc ; we also discuss the evolution of eccentric discs under this laminar dynamics .    in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we use the local model to analyse the linear hydrodynamic stability of an eccentric disc .",
    "in a thin astrophysical disc , the orbital motion is hypersonic and fluid elements follow ballistic trajectories to a first approximation . around a spherical central mass ,",
    "these trajectories are keplerian orbits , which can have eccentricity and inclination .",
    "a general keplerian disc involves smoothly nested orbits of variable eccentricity and inclination : it is both elliptical and warped .",
    "the case of a warped disc composed of variably inclined but circular orbits is more familiar and was treated recently by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider instead the case of an eccentric disc composed of variably elliptical but coplanar orbits .",
    "the general case of a warped and eccentric disc remains for future work .",
    "the dominant motion in an eccentric disc is orbital motion in the form of keplerian ellipses .",
    "orbital precession due to a small departure of the gravitational potential from that of a point mass , or due to weak relativistic effects , can be treated , along with the collective effects of the disc , as a perturbation of the keplerian motion .",
    "the eccentric disc can therefore be considered , to a first approximation , as a continuum of nested elliptical rings ( fig .",
    "[ f : disc ] ) , whose shape can be regarded as fixed in a non - rotating frame on the timescale of the orbital motion .     +    following @xcite , we label the orbits using their semi - latus rectum @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the semi - major axis and the eccentricity .",
    "the semi - latus rectum is directly related to the specific angular momentum @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is newton s constant and @xmath7 is the central mass . in an eccentric disc , the eccentricity @xmath4 and",
    "the longitude of pericentre @xmath8 can be regarded as functions of @xmath9 , and can be conveniently combined into the _ complex eccentricity _ @xmath10 .",
    "( note that the eccentricity , @xmath4 , and the base of natural logarithms , @xmath11 , are distinguished typographically . )",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath12 are equivalent to the components of the _ eccentricity vector _ @xmath13 .      again following @xcite",
    ", we make use of _ orbital coordinates _",
    "@xmath14 in the plane of the disc ( fig .",
    "[ f : orbital ] ) , instead of polar coordinates @xmath15 .",
    "the transformation between them is given by the polar equation of an ellipse , @xmath16}. \\label{ellipse}\\ ] ] the semi - latus rectum @xmath9 can be thought of as a quasi - radial coordinate that replaces @xmath17 , while @xmath18 is the usual azimuthal angular coordinate .",
    "orbital coordinates are , of course , well adapted to the geometry of an eccentric disc , in which the keplerian ellipses correspond to the curves @xmath19 .",
    "the disadvantage of these coordinates is that they are not orthogonal .",
    "since we will need to carry out vector and tensor calculus in these coordinates , we must first define a number of geometrical quantities , quoting results from @xcite .",
    "the components of the metric tensor @xmath20 and of its inverse @xmath21 are @xmath22 @xmath23 where the subscripts on @xmath24 denote partial derivatives of the function @xmath25 .",
    "the components of the levi - civita connection ( christoffel symbols ) are @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 the orbital coordinate system is easily extended to three dimensions by adding the third coordinate @xmath29 . apart from @xmath30 , all metric and connection components involving @xmath29 vanish .",
    "the jacobian of the coordinate system is @xmath31 in order that @xmath32 , i.e.  that the orbits are closed and nested without intersection , we require @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath9 . therefore both the eccentricity and the eccentricity gradient",
    "must be sufficiently small .",
    "further useful geometrical relations are derived in appendix  [ s : relations ] .",
    "although by convention @xmath35 , the same orbit is obtained by reversing the sign of @xmath4 and increasing ( or decreasing ) @xmath8 by @xmath36 , which leaves the complex eccentricity @xmath12 unchanged . in situations where @xmath37 has a simple zero corresponding to a circular orbit ,",
    "@xmath38 is well defined and non - zero on that orbit . however , as conventionally defined , @xmath4 has a discontinuous gradient there and @xmath8 changes abruptly by @xmath36 . in order to avoid this discontinuity and to construct a local model in such a case , we will allow @xmath4 to become negative on one side of the circular orbit so that @xmath39 is continuous there .    in principle",
    "the orbital coordinates are time - dependent as well as non - orthogonal .",
    "the difficulties that this introduces were treated by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we mainly circumvent these difficulties by assuming that the orbital geometry is fixed on the orbital timescale .",
    "however , the slow time - dependence of the coordinates is taken into account in deriving the evolutionary equations for the eccentric disc in section  [ s : evolution ] .",
    "we consider an ideal fluid satisfying the equation of motion , @xmath40 the equation of mass conservation , @xmath41 and the thermal energy equation , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the velocity , @xmath44 is the covariant derivative , @xmath45 is the gravitational potential , @xmath46 is the density , @xmath47 is the pressure , @xmath48 is the specific entropy and @xmath49 is the lagrangian derivative acting on scalar fields .",
    "we assume that the disc is of sufficiently low mass that self - gravity may be neglected .",
    "we work with the contravariant velocity components @xmath43 , which are simply the rates of change of the orbital coordinates of fluid elements .",

    "unlike the case of a warped disc composed of circular orbits , these equations do not follow simply from the conservation of mass and angular momentum .",
    "the evolution of the complex eccentricity , or eccentricity vector , is more subtle and is not purely conservative in nature .",
    "we consider first the case of a test particle in a keplerian orbit in the plane @xmath71 and subject to a perturbing force within that plane .",
