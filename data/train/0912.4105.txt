    "many different models of li depletion have been proposed to explain discrepancy : ( a ) @xcite proposed that the first generation of stars , population iii stars , could have processed some fraction of the halo gas , lowering the lithium abundance ; ( b ) other authors suggest that the primordial li abundance has been uniformly depleted in the atmospheres of metal - poor dwarfs by some physical mechanism ( e.g. turbulent diffusion as in @xcite ; gravitational waves as in @xcite , etc . ) ; and ( c ) finally , it has been also suggested that the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) calculations should be revised , possibly with the introduction of new physics as in e.g. @xcite .",

    "this work provides the first observations of the li doublet in ms stars of a globular cluster .",
    "we performed spectroscopic observations of the globular cluster ngc  6397 with the multi - object spectrograph flames - giraffe at the vlt on 2007 april , may , june and july , covering the spectral range @xmath264006800  at resolving power @xmath3 .",

    "the spectra were reduced with the eso pipeline and later on treated within midas .",
    "we correct the spectra for sky lines and , barycentric and radial velocity .",
    "we typically combine 17 spectra of dwarfs and 4 spectra of subgiants to achieve a similar s / n ratio between 80 and 130 in both sets of stars .",
    "the mean radial velocity of the cluster stars is @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we derived the effective temperature by fitting the observed h@xmath0 line profiles with synthetic profiles , using 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the co@xmath7bold code .",
    "the details of this code are provided in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ability of 3d models to reproduce balmer line profiles has been shown in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles of the sun as well as the metal - poor stars hd 84937 , hd 74000 and hd 140283 are studied . @xcite",
    "also quantified , from a purely theoretical point of view , the difference between the effective temperatures derived from h@xmath0 fitting using 1d and 3d models .",
    "we also derived the effective temperatures of ms and sg stars using 1d atlas  9 model atmospheres ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kurucz 2005 ) ) and the same fitting procedure . in fig .",
    "[ figteff ] we display the histograms of the effective temperatures derived for ms and sg stars using both 1d and 3d models . in the 1d case we got similar effective temperatures for both sets of stars .",
    "however , using 3d hydrodynamical models we obtained hotter temperatures by approximately 250  k in ms stars and 150  k for sg stars . in the 3d case",
    "the histogram of sg stars is slightly shifted with respect to the histogram of ms stars to cooler temperatures , as expected from the difference in surface gravity between ms and sg stars and the sensitivity of the @xmath8 colour to the surface gravity .",
    "fixed values for the surface gravity were adopted for both subgiant and dwarf stars in the sample , according to the values that best match the position of the stars on a 12 gyr isochrone ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* straniero et al . 1997 ) ) .",
    "the adopted values were @xmath9 and 3.85 for ms and sg stars , respectively .",
    "we measure the equivalent width ( ew ) of the li  i  6708   line in sg and ms stars by fitting synthetic spectra of known ew to the observed li profiles .",
    "@xcite showed the histograms of the ews measured in sg and ms stars of this cluster ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "in that figure it is clearly seen that the ews of sg stars are larger than those of ms stars .",
    "they also estimate the weighted mean ew of the sg stars , being @xmath10  pm larger than the weighted mean ew of ms stars .",
    "although the colour @xmath8 is sensitive to surface gravity , a priori , this result was not expected , and clearly suggests that subgiants in this cluster have actually higher li abundances than dwarfs .",
    "we derived li abundances using 3d model atmospheres .",
    "the line formation of li was treated in non - local thermodynamical equilibrium ( nlte ) using the same code and model atom used in @xcite .",
    "the analysis was also done using 1d model atmospheres providing essentially the same picture , even when @xmath11 in 1d are lower ( see also fig .",
    "6 online in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we display the histograms of the derived 1d - nlte and 3d - nlte li abundances of dwarf and subgiant stars of the globular cluster ngc 6397 . in both 1d and 3d cases ,",
    "the sg stars have on average larger amounts of li content in their atmospheres than ms stars .",
    "the difference in the mean li abundance of dwarfs and subgiants is @xmath12  dex in the 1d case and @xmath13  dex in the 3d case .",
    "this difference between the 1d and the 3d cases is due to the effective temperatures derived using 1d and 3d models , and is not related to the nlte corrections which were independently computed in the 1d and 3d cases .",
    "in fact , due to the cooler temperatures derived in 1d with respect to the 3d case , the mean 1d li abundance lower by @xmath14  dex for the ms stars @xmath15  dex for the sg stars than the mean 3d abundance .",
    "@xcite also find different mean li abundances , using 1d models , in mss and sgs , but only by 0.03  dex although still significant at 1@xmath16 .",
    "however , their result is partially affected by the very narrow range of @xmath11 for mss deduced by @xcite ( @xmath17  k ) compared to the wide range ( @xmath18  k ) for the sgs ( see fig .  7 online in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the points in that figure display a decreasing trend of li abundance with decreasing temperature .",

    "our results imply that the li surface abundance depends on the evolutionary status of the star . in fig .  2 of @xcite , the li isochrones for different turbulent diffusion models ( ( * ?",
    "* richard et al .",
    "these models were shifted up by 0.14 dex in li abundance to make the initial abundance of the models , @xmath19 , coincide with the primordial li abundance predicted from fluctuations of the microwave background measured by the wmap satellite ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cyburt et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "the models assuming pure atomic diffusion , and , among those including low levels of turbulent mixing , in particular the model t6.0 , preferred model in @xcite and @xcite are ruled out by our observations , since they predict the li content in ms stars to be higher than in sg stars . the only model that predicts a li pattern which is qualitatively similar to that observed , is the t6.25 model .",
    "this model shows a decreasing trend of li abundances with decreasing temperatures and also predicts higher abundances for sg stars than for ms stars although at temperatures lower than 6000  k , which is not consistent with the observed trend even in the 1d case ( see fig .  1 in ( * ?",
    "* gonzlez hernndez et al . 2009b ) ) .",
    "models including atomic diffusion and tachocline mixing ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* piau 2008 ) ) do not seem to reproduce our observations either , since they provide a constant li abundance up to 5500k .",
    "more sophisticated models are required , for instance , those models that besides including diffusion and rotation also take into account the effect of internal gravity waves ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* talon & charbonnel 2004 ) ) , seem to predict accurately the li abundance pattern in solar - type stars , at solar metallicity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* charbonnel & talon 2005 ) ) , but models at low metallicity are still needed .",
    "the cosmological lithium discrepancy still needs to be solved .",
