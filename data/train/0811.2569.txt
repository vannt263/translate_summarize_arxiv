    "the discovery of superconductivity at 26 k in lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas has generated tremendous interest in the field of high - t@xmath5 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "lafeaso with the tetragonal zrcusias - type structure becomes superconducting by doping to induce carrier to the feas layers@xcite . shortly after that discovery",
    ", the t@xmath5 was raised to 41 - 55 k by replacing la by other rare - earth ce@xcite , sm@xcite , pr@xcite , nd@xcite , gd@xcite , etc .",
    "the crystal structure of laofeas contains alternating layers of edge - sharing fe@xmath6as@xmath6 tetrahedral layers and la@xmath6o@xmath6 tetrahedral layers along c - axis .",
    "in addition to the superconductivity@xcite , the system displays a closely related electron - pair instability on the fermi surface : the spin - density - wave(sdw)@xcite .",
    "the competition between superconductivity and sdw instability was identified in the doped lnofeas(1111 ) system@xcite .",
    "recently , the ternary iron arsenide bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 shows superconductivity at 38k by hole doping with partial substitution of potassium for barium@xcite . there exists a single feas layer in an unit cell in lnofeas system , while there are two feas layers in an unit cell in bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 with thcr@xmath6si@xmath6-type structure .",
    "the superconductivity is also observed at 37 k in isostructural k- and cs - doped srfe@xmath6as@xmath6@xcite , at 20 k in na - doped cafe@xmath6as@xmath6@xcite and at 32 k in k - doped eufe@xmath6as@xmath6@xcite .",
    "all these parent compounds share the common features of a structure transition and sdw ordering , which were characterized by the anomaly in resistivity , specific heat and magnetic susceptibility . moreover , the structure transition and sdw ordering were suppressed , and the superconductivity was induced in the parent samples rfe@xmath6as@xmath6(r = ca , ba , sr ) under high pressure@xcite .",
    "the superconductivity with t@xmath7 3 k was found in isostructural kfe@xmath6as@xmath6 , and no anomaly appears in resistivity@xcite .",
    "it suggests that no structural and sdw transitions happen in kfe@xmath6as@xmath6 .",
    "the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy(arpes ) measurements on the samples kfe@xmath6as@xmath6 and ba@xmath8k@xmath9fe@xmath6as@xmath6 clarified key features of the band structure and fermi surface ( fs ) topology . unlike ba@xmath8k@xmath9fe@xmath6as@xmath6 , the nesting condition via the antiferromagnetism ( af ) wave vector is not satisfied in kfe@xmath6as@xmath6@xcite . if one takes kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 as a parent compound , it is possible that substitution of the rare - earth element for potassium induces more carrier into system and consequently enhance superconducting transition temperature t@xmath10 . here",
    "we report the synthesis of the samples k@xmath0ln@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( ln = sm , nd and la ) , and systematically study their transport properties ( resistivity and thermoelectric power ) .",
    "it is found that substitution of ln ( la , nd , sm ) for potassium leads to an increase of t@xmath10 up to 36 k. the behavior of resistivity and tep of k@xmath0ln@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 are very similar to that observed in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , and the tep is positive , indicating p - type carrier .",
    "polycrystalline samples of k@xmath0ln@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( ln = sm , nd and la ) were synthesized by solid state reaction method using kas , fe@xmath2as and lnas as starting materials .",
    "kas was pre - synthesized by heating the mixture of k lumps and as powder at 200@xmath13 for 24 hours .",
    "lnas was prepared by the reaction of ln ( la , nd , sm ) powder and as powder at 600@xmath13 for 24 hours .",
    "the raw materials were accurately weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio of k@xmath0ln@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , then thoroughly grounded and pressed into pellets . about 20 - 30% excessive k was added because k was easy to volatilize and reacted with quartz tube at high temperature .",
    "the pellets were wrapped with ta foil and sealed in quartz tube under about 1/4 atm ar gas atmosphere .",
    "the sealed tubes were sintered at 740 @xmath13 for 24 hours . in order to improve its homogeneity and stiffness ,",
    "the resulting product was reground before applying a second heat treatment at 720@xmath13 for 20 hours .",
