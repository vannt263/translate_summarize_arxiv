    "it is well known that @xmath0 gauge theories at high temperature undergo a phase transition to a deconfined phase . although at the phase transition point basic thermodynamic observables show a drastic qualitative change , there are some correlation functions of physical interest whose structure does not change qualitatively at @xmath1 .",
    "for example , this is the case for the pseudo - potential extracted from spatial wilson loops .",
    "it is confining for all temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is taken as indication that certain confining properties survive in the high temperature phase . while the leading high temperature behaviour of the pseudo - potential for temperatures well above @xmath1 can be understood in terms of high temperature perturbation theory ,",
    "non - perturbative effects make it difficult to compute that near the phase transition point .",
    "so far only a lattice study of the whole temperature dependence of the spatial string tension exists @xcite .",
    "the situation changed drastically with the invention of the ads / cft correspondence that resumed interest in finding a string description of strong interactions .",
    "its more phenomenological cousin called ads / qcd deals with a five - dimensional effective description and tries to fit it to qcd as much as possible .    in this letter",
    "we will explore the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension and thermal phase transition within ads / qcd .",
    "there are good motivations for doing so .",
    "first , in a recent paper @xcite we have constructed a phenomenological heavy - quark potential which has a remarkable similarity to the cornell potential .",
    "we did so by using the slightly deformed ads metric .",
    "second , it is already known that the thermodynamics of @xmath2 super yang - mills theory is related to the ads black hole geometry @xcite .",
    "what we need now is to include the thermodynamics into the five - dimensional framework of @xcite . to this end , we consider the following euclidean background metric    @xmath3    where @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is a periodic variable of period @xmath6 .",
    "at zero value of the deformation parameter @xmath7 we have the @xmath8 black hole metric , as expected . here",
    "@xmath9 is related to the hawking temperature @xmath10 whose dual description is nothing but the temperature of gauge theory . on the other hand , at @xmath11 we have in fact the slightly deformed @xmath8 metric .",
    "such a deformation is notable .",
    "the point is that in this background linearized five - dimensional yang - mills equations are effectively reduced to laguerre differential equation . as a result",
    ", the spectrum turns out to be like that of the linear regge models @xcite .",
    "this fact allows us to fix the value of @xmath7 from the @xmath12 meson trajectory .",
    "it is of order @xcite    @xmath13    the central point now is that the metric contain any free fit parameter .",
    "thus , evaluation of the spatial string tension which we will undertake can be considered as a crucial test of ads / qcd in the infrared region .",
    "given the background metric , we can calculate expectation values of wilson loops by using the standard formalism of ads / cft .",
    "the wilson loops obeying an area law provide string tensions .",
    "our goal is therefore to study spatial wilson loops .    to this end",
    ", we consider a rectangular loop @xmath14 along two spatial directions @xmath15 on the boundary ( @xmath16 ) of five - dimensional space . as usual , we take one direction to be large , say @xmath17 .",
    "the quark and antiquark are set at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "next , we make use of the nambu - goto action equip with the background metric and choose the world - sheet coordinates as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this yields    @xmath22    where @xmath23 .",
    "a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "now it is easy to find the equation of motion for @xmath25 @xmath26 as well as the first integral @xmath27 the integration constant @xmath28 can be expressed via the maximum value of @xmath25 . on symmetry grounds",
    ", @xmath25 reaches it at @xmath29 .. the solution of interest has @xmath30 . ]",
    "by virtue of , the integral over @xmath31 $ ] of @xmath32 is equal to    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .    at this point",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the integral is real for @xmath37 subject to    [ walls ] @xmath38    note that in the limit as @xmath7 goes to zero @xmath37 is bounded by a horizon ( @xmath39 ) , as should be for the black hole geometry .",
    "this gives rise to the first wall . on the other hand , for zero temperature",
    "it is also bounded if @xmath40 .",
    "the physical reason for this is a gravitational force appeared because of the deformation of the ads metric .",
    "the easiest way to see what is going on is to introduce the effective string tension depending on @xmath25 .",
    "it is simply @xmath41 as follows from the form of the metric .",
    "now consider the behavior of a string bit in the potential @xmath42 shown in fig.1 .",
    "the potential reaches its minimum value exactly at @xmath43 , so a repulsive force prevents the string from getting deeper in @xmath25 direction .",
    "note that because the string ends on the ( infinitely ) heavy quark - antiquark pair set at @xmath16 , it does nt completely roll down to the minima of the potential .",
    "this gives rise to the second wall of @xcite . in summary , there are the two walls in the problem in question .",
    "this fact will play a key role in understanding the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension .",
    "now , as in @xcite , we will compute the energy of the configuration . in the process",
    "we regularize the integral over @xmath25 by imposing a cutoff @xmath44 .",
    "finally , the regularized expression takes the form    @xmath45    its @xmath44-expansion is simply    @xmath46    where    @xmath47",
    "\\biggr ) \\,.\\ ] ]    similarly as @xmath48 , @xmath49 is real only for @xmath37 subject to the constraints .    as in the case of zero temperature @xcite ,",
    "the pseudo - potential in question is written in parametric form given by eqs . and .",
    "it is unclear to us how to eliminate the parameter @xmath37 and find @xmath49 as a function of @xmath48 , @xmath50 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we can , however , gain some important insights from numerical calculations .    in fig.2",
    "we have plotted @xmath51 against @xmath48 . apparently the pseudo - potential shows temperature dependence of its slope .",
    "moreover , there exists a critical value of t such that the spatial string tension is temperature independent below @xmath1 and rises rapidly above .",
    "the slope of the potential is given by @xmath52 or @xmath53 ( coefficients in front of the linear terms at large and small distances ) depending on the value of @xmath7 .",
    "however , their ratio is of order @xmath54 .",
    "since it is not significant for our phenomenological estimates , we will be interested in @xmath52 in what follows .",
    "] interestingly enough , on the lattice such a picture was discovered in @xcite .",
    "having seen the pattern from the numerics , we can now try to find a temperature dependence of the spatial string tension .",
    "first , let us have a close look at eq ..",
    "after a short inspection we find that @xmath48 is a continuously growing function of @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that large distances correspond to a region near the upper endpoint which is the smallest of @xmath55 and @xmath9 .",
    "the integral is dominated by @xmath56 , where it takes the form @xmath57 .",
    "such an integral may be found in tables @xcite .",
    "finally , we get    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is a polynomial in @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "explicitly , it is given by @xmath62 at the upper endpoint @xmath63 , as expected .    in a similar spirit",
    ", we can explore the long distance behavior of @xmath49 .",
    "it follows from that in the neighbor of the upper endpoint the energy behaves as    @xmath64    along with the relation , this means that at long distances the pseudo - potential is linear .",
    "the spatial string tension is given by    @xmath65    at this stage , we set @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that @xmath52 is the physical string tension at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "now we will discuss the issue concerning the phase transition to the deconfined phase .",
    "we begin by making some qualitative comments about the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension . from the ads",
    "/ qcd perspective there are three possibilities shown in fig.3 .",
    "\\(i ) @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the second wall terminates the string .",
    "if so , then the large distance physics of the string is determined by this wall . as a result",
    ", we find the same behavior as in @xcite .",
    "we therefore interpret this as the low temperature phase or , equivalently , the confined phase .",
    "( ii ) @xmath69 .",
    "this time the first wall terminates the string .",
    "the large distance physics is determined by the near horizon geometry of the @xmath8 black hole and the spatial string tension scales like @xmath70 at high temperature @xcite .",
    "we interpret this phase as the high temperature phase or , equivalently , the deconfined phase .",
    "( iii ) @xmath71 .",
    "this implies that the two walls coincide .",
    "we interpret this as a dual description ( in the holographic sense of ads / qcd ) of the phase transition point .",
    "put in a slightly different way , @xmath71 , in terms of a critical temperature and the parameter @xmath7 , is given by    @xmath72    having the ads / qcd pattern of the phase transition , we can now make a couple of estimates relevant to phenomenology .",
    "it is of physical interest to estimate the critical temperature of our model . from and we have    @xmath73    next , we can estimate the ratio @xmath74 , where @xmath52 is the zero temperature string tension .",
    "it is found by using eqs . and ,    @xmath75    the constant @xmath76 was fixed in @xcite from the linear term of the cornell potential .",
    "its numerical value is of order @xmath77 .",
    "the estimate coincides within 7 per cent with the lattice data for @xmath78 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the agreement of theory with the data is very pleasing at this point .",
    "finally , we can compare the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension with the results of @xcite for the high temperature phase of @xmath79 gauge theory . from the fit @xmath80 at @xmath81 to the data given in table 1 of @xcite",
    "we now fix the value of @xmath76 and obtain depends on a number of colors , we have to adjust its value to @xmath79 . ]",
    "@xmath82    in fig.4 we have plotted @xmath80 against @xmath83 .",
    "we find that the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension is in good agreement with the lattice data in the region @xmath84 . from this point of view",
    "it can be thought of as a description of the spatial string tension in the high temperature phase near the phase transition point .",
    "note that the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension at high temperatures is determined by the @xmath59-function of gauge theory .",
    "in particular the logarithmic dependence is seen in the data at high temperatures .",
    "the model can not reproduce logarithmic dependences associated with the small coupling running . instead",
    ", it provides a complementary description in the strong coupling regime that is in accord with the ideas on the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to emphasize again that we have _ not _ introduced any _ new _ parameter to describe the critical temperature as well as the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension .",
    "the only dimensionful parameter of our model is @xmath7 .",
    "it appears as the regge parameter at zero temperature .",
    "moreover , the physical string tension at zero temperature is proportional to @xmath7 with the coefficient of proportionality fixed from the linear term of the cornell potential @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the phase transition appears then calculable .",
    "note a crucial factor of @xmath85 which explains , in the framework considered , the lower scale of the critical temperature , @xmath86 , than @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension is very soft below @xmath1 and sharp above @xmath1 .",
    "this feature of the data is also explained by the model .",
    "to summarize , the ads / qcd correspondence provides a quantitative framework for temperatures of order @xmath1 which works with about @xmath88 accuracy .      o.a .",
