    "a major goal of cosmology is to determine the fundamental cosmological parameters that describe our universe .",
    "observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide unique data in achieving this goal through a determination of their power spectrum .",
    "an accurate measurement of the cmb power spectrum requires a good knowledge of the various galactic foregrounds which have their own frequency and power spectra .",
    "this is particularly important for all - sky , high - sensitivity cmb experiments such as _ wmap _ ( bennett et al . 2003 ) and _ planck _ ( tauber 2000 ) .",
    "for example , the cmb power spectrum expected from observations with the _ planck _ satellite will be accurate to @xmath14 per cent over the @xmath15-range @xmath16 ; this corresponds to a temperature accuracy of better than @xmath17k over the angular range @xmath18 to 5 arcmin .",
    "the galactic foregrounds should therefore be estimated to better than this value , otherwise the cmb data will be degraded .",
    "the @xmath1-dmr data ( bennett et al . 1996 ) covering @xmath19 at frequencies of 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz are constrained by knowledge of the foregrounds ; this is also the case for the the _ wmap _ data , particularly on the largest angular scales discussed here .",
    "the challenge is to make use of the largest sky coverage possible to reduce the sample variance on such large angular scales ( @xmath20 ) ; the area available has normally been restricted to galactic latitudes @xmath21 or @xmath22 . in this paper",
    "we attempt to improve on available knowledge of the foregrounds and apply it to the @xmath1-dmr data in order to determine whether the fraction of sky available for cosmological assessment can be extended .",
    "the recent _ wmap _ analysis of the 1st year observations ( bennett et al .",
    "2003a ) uses the 23 ghz channel as a basis for a galactic mask which eliminates @xmath2321 per cent of the sky from detailed cmb analysis ( bennett et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "previous studies of galactic foregrounds relevant to the cmb at frequencies less than 100 ghz have used the 408  mhz map of haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) as the synchrotron template and fir dust emission ( iras or dirbe ) as a template for the free - free which was thought to be correlated with dust and hi ( kogut et al .",
    "1996a , b ) .",
    "it was widely established that at @xmath24 ghz a dust - correlated foreground was present ( de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 ; leitch et al . 1997",
    "; kogut 1999 ) although it was at a level which significantly exceeded the free - free emission expected from the partial h@xmath0  surveys available at the time .",
    "this dust - correlated anomalous emission has been ascribed to spinning dust ( draine & lazarian 1998a , hereafter dl98 , 1998b ) and appears to fit the expected narrow frequency spectrum ( de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 , 2000 , 2002 ) , although mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) weaken some of these arguments and claim that definitive statements about the origin of the dust - correlated component can not be made based on data at 10 and 15 ghz alone .",
    "bennett et al .",
    "( 2003b ) find a dust - correlated component which they interpret as synchrotron emission with a flatter spectral index .",
    "lagache ( 2003 ) , however , argues that this emission is intrinsic to the dust itself and arises from small , cold grains .",
    "this is discussed further in section [ sec : wmap_comparison ] .",
    "a significant development now available for assessing and quantifying the galactic foregrounds is the unambiguous identification of the free - free component independent of the quasi - correlated dust .",
    "the new h@xmath0  surveys by the wisconsin h - alpha mapper , wham ( reynolds et al .",
    "1998 ; haffner 1999 ) , and the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas , shassa ( gaustad et al . 2001 ) , now make this possible .",
    "they can be used to produce an all - sky free - free template when corrected for h@xmath0  absorption by dust and when evaluated at the electron temperature appropriate to the ionized gas in the local region of the milky way ( dickinson et al . 2003 ) .    in the present paper , using cross - correlation techniques , we quantify the synchrotron and free - free emission , leaving a clearer estimate of the microwave emission associated with galactic dust .",
    "we use the @xmath1-dmr data at 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) to identify an anomalous dust - correlated component which previously contained an unknown amount of free - free emission .",
    "our results are strengthened by including correlations with a 19.2 ghz survey of the sky ( cottingham 1987 ; boughn et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "our present study leads to a frequency spectral index @xmath25 for the synchrotron emission ; although @xmath25 varies with position this global value is adequate for predicting the actual ( small ) contribution at higher radio frequencies ( @xmath26 ghz ) .",
    "we also investigate the effects of dust absorption and electron temperature in deriving the free - free template .",
    "finally , we utilise our improved understanding of the three galactic templates to re - examine the determination of the quadrupole normalization @xmath10  and the scalar fluctuation index @xmath11  from the @xmath1-dmr data ( grski et al .",
    "we extend the area of sky available by using data closer to the galactic plane and examine the stability of @xmath27 and @xmath11 values as a function of the latitude range included in the analyses .",
    "the synchrotron emission from the galaxy originates in relativistic cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons spiralling in galactic magnetic fields .",
    "these electrons will have a a range of spectral energy distributions depending on their age and the environment of origin ( e.g. supernova explosions or diffuse shocks in the interstellar medium ) .",
    "the variations in cr electron spectral index will translate into variations in the frequency spectral index of the synchrotron continuum emission .",
    "synchrotron emission , with its temperature spectral index of @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , dominates over thermal bremsstrahlung ( free - free ) emission with @xmath31 at frequencies below @xmath14 ghz over most regions of the sky .",
    "exceptions are the galactic ridge and the brighter features of the local gould belt system ( dickinson et al .",
    "2003 )    the only all - sky map at sufficiently low frequency to provide a template of galactic synchrotron emission is the 408  mhz survey by haslam et al .",
    "this has a resolution of 51 arcmin and has a brightness temperature scale `` absolutely calibrated '' with the 404 mhz @xmath32 survey of pauliny - toth & shakeshaft ( 1962 ) .",
    "in the present investigation we will derive ( for the sky area analysed ) a mean spectral index between 408  mhz and 19.2 ghz from the cottingham ( 1987 ) survey and 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz from the @xmath1-dmr survey .",
    "it is important to remember that the spectral index of galactic synchrotron emission varies with frequency and position on the sky .",
    "the analysis of low - frequency surveys by lawson et al .",
    "( 1987 ) indicates that the brighter regions away from the galactic plane have typical spectral indices of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at 100 and 800 mhz respectively .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath25 evaluated between any pair of frequencies separated by a factor of @xmath35 varies typically by @xmath36 over the sky ( reich & reich 1988 ) .",
    "bennett et al .",
    "( 2003b ) propose a model using _ wmap _ data which includes a flat spectrum synchrotron component ( @xmath37 ) in regions of star formation near the galactic plane and a steep spectrum component ( @xmath38 ) from the galactic halo .    at frequencies higher than @xmath35 ghz",
    "no reliable zero levels can be measured for large - area surveys at intermediate and high latitudes where cmb measurements are normally conducted and as a consequence , large area spectral index maps can not be made . however ,",
    "the spectral index of smaller angular scale ( @xmath39 and less ) structures can be estimated from cross - correlation analyses of maps at different frequencies .",
    "for example , hancock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a spectral index of @xmath40 at 10 ghz from bremsstrahlung data at 10,15 and 33 ghz .",
    "it is interesting to note that the steepening of the brightness temperature spectral index by 0.5 at higher frequencies expected from synchrotron losses would lead to @xmath41 at higher frequencies ; this is the value at these frequencies expected from the local cr electron spectrum ( platania et al .",
    "1998 ) .      for the free - free template , we use the all - sky h@xmath0  template described in dickinson et al .",
    "the all - sky map is a composite of h@xmath0  data from the wham survey of the northern sky ( reynolds et al .",
    "1998 ; haffner 1999 ) and shassa survey in the southern sky ( gaustad et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the shassa data are first smoothed to the wham resolution of @xmath42 and are preferred at declinations @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noted that the all - sky template is a first attempt at producing a high - sensitivity all - sky h@xmath0  map .",
    "shassa data have significantly lower sensitivity than data from the wham survey ; the noise levels are estimated as @xmath44 and @xmath45 rayleigh ( @xmath46 ) respectively , where @xmath47 photons s@xmath6 @xmath48  sr@xmath49 erg s@xmath6 @xmath48  sr@xmath50 for @xmath51  k gas .",
    "baseline uncertainties exist in both data - sets , particularly shassa data which results in loss of information on angular scales @xmath52 for data at @xmath53 due to the @xmath54 field - of - view of each pointing .",
    "however , the shassa background levels are fitted to wham data where wham data exist ( @xmath55 ) with an assumed cosecant law for declinations further south",
    ". the different observing strategies result in different beam shapes which have not been accounted for . finally , large h@xmath0  signals ( emission and absorption ) from bright stars",
    "have been filtered using different techniques ; the wham team use data from nearby unaffected pixels , while the shassa team use a median filter to reduce star residuals .",
    "however , all these possible systematics are significantly reduced when the data , at a resolution of @xmath56 , are convolved with the dmr beam at @xmath57 resolution .",
    "indeed , we have explicitly verified this by comparing the power spectra of the high - latitude h@xmath0emission after varying the latitude at which the surveys are matched and adjusting baselines .",
    "recently , finkbeiner ( 2003 ) has produced an all - sky h@xmath0  map at 6 arcmin resolution which includes higher resolution data from the virginia - tech sky survey ( dennison et al .",
    "the differences in the power spectrum of our h@xmath0  map with that given by finkbeiner ( 2003 ) are less than 10 per cent for @xmath58 and less than 30 per cent everywhere .",
    "the optical h@xmath0  line ( @xmath59 nm ) is well known to be a good tracer of the free - free continuum emission at radio wavelengths since they are both emitted by the same ionized gas .",
    "since they are both proportional to the emission measure ( @xmath60 ) there is a well - defined relationship between the h@xmath0  line intensity @xmath61 and the radio continuum brightness temperature @xmath62 ( osterbrock 1989 ; valls - gabaud 1998 ; dickinson et al .",
    "there is a strong dependence on frequency since free - free emission scales as @xmath63 at ghz frequencies .",
    "there is also a modest dependence on the electron temperature @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . in the galaxy",
    ", @xmath64 can range between 3000  k and 15000  k ( shaver et al .",
    "1983 ) ; the majority of hii regions have @xmath64 between 5000 and 10000  k ( reynolds 1985 ) .",
    "shaver et al .",
    "( 1983 ) show that the mean electron temperature of hii regions at the galactocentric radius of the sun ( @xmath66 kpc ) is 7200  k with an r.m.s .",
    "spread of 1200  k. in the region of the galaxy covered in the present study where @xmath9 the ionized hydrogen will be typically within @xmath14 kpc of the sun and accordingly we adopt a value of @xmath51  k. with this value of @xmath64 , the conversions from h@xmath0  to free - free continuum for frequencies 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz are 5.25 , 1.71 and 0.54 @xmath2k  @xmath67 respectively . in section [ sec :",
    "results_foregrounds ] we will use this prior information to allow a fixed free - free component to be subtracted giving a clearer separation of the foregrounds .",
    "we will take a variation of @xmath68 k from the local value of 7000  k as in indication of the upper and lower bounds allowed .",
    "other caveats become important at the few per cent level : i ) the helium abundance is usually taken to be 8 per cent with a spread of a few per cent ii ) the emitting medium is assumed to be optically thick ( case b ) to the lyman continuum photons .    a major uncertainty when using the h@xmath0  template is the absorption of h@xmath0  by foreground dust .",
    "the absorption can be estimated using the @xmath69 m maps given by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter sfd ) .",
    "the absorption at h@xmath0@xmath70 in magnitudes using their temperature - corrected column density map ( @xmath71 ) in units of mjy  sr@xmath6 is then @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the fraction of dust _ in front _ of the h@xmath0  actually causing absorption in the line of sight .",
    "the corrected h@xmath0  intensity is then @xmath74 .",
    "although there are uncertainties in this relationship due to different reddening values expected from different dust populations , the largest uncertainty is in @xmath73 , the fraction of dust lying in front of the h@xmath0-emitting region .",
    "dickinson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that for a range of longitudes ( @xmath75 ) , and for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , while for local high latitude regions such as orion and the gum nebula , there is little or no absorption by dust ( @xmath78 ) . for much of the high latitude sky , @xmath71 is @xmath79 mjy  sr@xmath6 and therefore the absorption is likely to be small ( @xmath80 mag ) . at lower galactic latitudes",
    "@xmath81 , the dust absorption strongly increases to 1 mag and above .",
    "for the majority of the galactic plane ( @xmath82 ) , the absorption is too great to make any reliable estimate of the true h@xmath0  intensity .",
    "finally , the scattering of h@xmath0  light from dust at high galactic latitudes could , in principle , cause a degeneracy in the analysis since the scattered h@xmath0  light would be directly correlated with the dust .",
    "however , wood & reynolds ( 1999 ) predict that this accounts for less than 20 per cent of high latitude h@xmath0  emission .",
    "since the anomalous component is larger than the free - free component at frequencies higher than @xmath83 ghz ( see sections [ sec : results_foregrounds ] and [ sec : results_anomalous ] ) , this systematic will not significantly affect our results within the errors .      as templates for the thermal and anomalous dust - correlated emission , we utilise the @xmath1-dirbe data repixelised into the healpix pixelisation scheme .",
    "this was achieved using the publicly available calibrated individual observations ( cio ) files together with the dirbe sky and zodi atlas ( dsza , both products being described in hauser et al .",
    "1998 ) , allowing the construction of dirbe full sky maps corrected for the zodiacal emission according to the model of kelsall et al .",
    "in particular , we use the dirbe 140  @xmath2 m  data at @xmath84 resolution : although the 100  @xmath2 m   data has the best sensitivity , there remain more noticeable artifacts present in the sky map after zodiacal correction . while this is not likely to present a problem after the data has been convolved with the dmr beam profile ( @xmath57 fwhm ) , our choice allows maximal consistency with previous analyses by the dmr team ( banday et al .",
    "1996 ; grski et al . 1996 ;",
    "kogut et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "furthermore , the sfd version of the 100  @xmath2 m  sky map has been used to correct for dust absorption in the h@xmath0  template , thus our choice allows some additional independence in the dust correlation results .",
    "dl98 have suggested that the anomalous dust - correlated signal which we re - investigate in this work should be significantly correlated with 12 @xmath2 m  emission , so that the corresponding dirbe sky map may prove a better tracer for this foreground component .",
    "however , the 12 @xmath2 m  map contains residual zodiacal artifacts in the region of the ecliptic plane which remain significant even after smoothing to dmr resolution .",
    "the impact of this could be minimised by excluding a region close to the ecliptic plane , but we prefer to make use of the greatest sky coverage possible .",
    "further , de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have tested this hypothesis , but it is clear from their fig .",
    "4 that even after considerable processing of the 12 @xmath2 m  dirbe data for the removal of both zodiacal emission and point sources , the longer wavelength data at 100 , 140 and 240 @xmath2mremain equally viable for correlation studies .    finally ,",
    "in order to attempt to isolate the anomalous dust - correlated component signal , it is necessary to identify and subtract the thermal dust emission .",
    "we have employed the predictions of finkbeiner , davis & schlegel ( 1999 , hereafter fds ) for the thermal dust emission at dmr wavelengths .",
    "fds consider 8 models based on the 100 and 240 @xmath2 m  maps from sfd , and test them against the @xmath1-firas data .",
    "the inconsistency of extrapolations of the sfd maps using single component power - law emissivity functions with the firas data over the range 200 - 2100 ghz motivated the development of generalised two - component models .",
    "we have considered fds models 7 and 8 as plausible tracers of the thermal dust component emission .",
    "masi et al . (",
    "2001 ) have demonstrated that model 8 extrapolated to 410 ghz is well correlated with the boomerang data at that frequency , and a recent analysis of the maxima data ( jaffe et al .",
    "2003 ) also see consistency with these extrapolated dust models .",
    "it should be remembered that the fds models are formally correct only on scales comparable to or larger than the firas beam , hence the fds predictions of model 7/8 should be well - matched to our purposes .",
    "in this analysis , we utilise the @xmath1-dmr 4-year sky maps ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) at 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz in galactic coordinates and the healpix pixelisation scheme with a resolution parameter of @xmath85 , corresponding to 12288 pixels on the sky .",
    "inverse - noise - variance weighted combinations of the a and b channels are formed at each of the three dmr frequencies , the weights being ( 0.618 , 0.382 ) , ( 0.579 , 0.421 ) and ( 0.382 , 0.618 ) at 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz respectively . the dominant feature visible in the sky maps ( given that the dipole anisotropy of amplitude @xmath23 3 mk",
    "is largely removed in the pre - map - making data processing ) is the enhanced emission along the galactic plane .",
    "this emission is indeed a combination of the synchrotron , free - free and dust emission that we are interested in , however , the distribution and spectral behaviour at the lowest latitudes ( @xmath86 ) is sufficiently complex that we do not attempt to fit or model it , considering only the mid- and high - latitude galactic emission .",
    "contrary to previous analyses , we attempt to fit our templates to somewhat lower latitudes , the results of which are discussed in section  [ sec : results_foregrounds ] .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1-dmr data , we also consider correlations of the foreground templates with a 19.2 ghz survey of the sky ( cottingham 1987 ; boughn et al .",
    "such an investigation is clearly of interest here since 19.2 ghz is close to the frequency at which the dl98 models for spinning dust show a maximum in spectral behaviour .",
    "even if the anomalous dust - correlated component is not the putative rotational dust emission , the coupling amplitude of the dust template at 19.2 ghz should enable the spectrum of this foreground to be established , in particular since the frequency of observation is well - removed from that where a significant thermal dust contribution is present .",
    "the data are available in the @xmath1 quadcube format ( white & stemwedel , 1992 ) with 24,576 pixels on the full sky of size @xmath87 , and contains observations of angular resolution 3  fwhm . a small region close to the south ecliptic pole was not observed .",
    "the typical noise level is quoted as 1.5 mk per resolution element , but there is both variation in the number of observations per pixel and pixel - pixel covariance .",
    "in contrast to the analysis of de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we take account of the former , but the information is not available for the latter . some attempt to provide additional constraints on the noise uncertainty",
    "is performed by scaling the noise level by a factor in the range 0.9 - 1.1 , and including this parameter in our later statistical analysis .",
    "each of the three dmr maps , the 19.2 ghz data , and the foreground sky map templates ( after convolution to the correct angular resolution ) are decomposed into harmonic coefficients using a basis of orthonormal functions explicitly computed on the incompletely sampled sky ( grski 1994 ) , a procedure which is directly analogous to the expansion of a full - sky map in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients .",
    "this technique has the advantage of allowing exact exclusion of the monopole and dipole components from the analysis ( which are unimportant for the investigation of cosmological anisotropy ) , and makes full use of all of the available spatial ( phase ) information .",
    "we have adopted several definitions for the area of sky coverage , in particular the standard galactic cut defined as the region with galactic latitude , @xmath88 , above 20@xmath89 with additional regions at ophiuchus ( up to @xmath90 at @xmath91 ) and orion ( down to @xmath92 at @xmath93 ) based on the dirbe 140  @xmath2 m  map ( banday et al .",
    "1997 , but recomputed explicitly for the healpix scheme ) , together with more aggressive and conservative cuts of @xmath88 greater than 15@xmath89 and 30@xmath89 respectively . for each sky coverage a new basis of orthonormal functions is computed .",
    "this procedure must also be performed separately for the 19.2 ghz data due to its different pixelisation scheme and pixel resolution ( and indeed for the foreground templates matched to the same pixelisation and angular resolution ) .",
    "the measured map coefficients in the new orthogonal basis at a given frequency , @xmath94 , can then be written in vector form as @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the coefficients describing the true cmb distribution , the noise and one foreground template map respectively .",
    "@xmath99 is now a coupling constant ( with units @xmath2k  @xmath100 ) to be determined by minimizing    @xmath101    where * m * is the covariance matrix describing the correlation between different fourier modes on the cut - sky and is dependent on assumed cmb model parameters and the instrument noise .",
    "full details of its computation can be found in grski ( 1994 ) and grski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    by minimising the @xmath102 with respect to @xmath99 we find that the coupling constant @xmath99 has an exact solution @xmath103 and a gaussian error given by @xmath104    the contribution of component @xmath105 to the observed sky is the map @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 is in the natural units of the foreground template map so that this scaled quantity is in @xmath2k ) . in this analysis ,",
    "however , we treat multiple foreground templates and all three dmr channels simultaneously .",
    "this forces the cmb distribution ( in thermodynamic units ) to be invariant between the three frequencies , and suppresses the sensitivity of the method to noise features in the individual dmr maps which are clearly not common to all three frequencies , thus allowing an improved determination of the extent of chance cosmic or noise alignments with the template maps .",
    "we have tested the impact of such chance alignments to the method by repeating the fits after rotation of the foreground templates .",
    "we only find significant correlations when the templates are correctly aligned .",
    "moreover , the r.m.s values of the coupling coefficients derived from the rotated sky maps are consistent with the errors determined directly in the analysis .",
    "the full details of this method are contained in grski et al .",
    "the 19.2 ghz data are treated in a similar fashion , but we do not extend the method to include it in a simultaneous fit with the dmr data to the foreground templates because of complications introduced by its different angular resolution and noise properties .",
    "having solved for the values of the coupling coefficients and their gaussian errors , we are then in a position to compute the likelihood of the foreground corrected data as a function of a given set of input cosmological parameters as contained in the matrix @xmath108 of equation  [ eqn : chi2 ] . indeed , this also allows us to assess the sensitivity of the coupling constant fits to the assumed cosmological power spectrum .",
    "we consider a full grid of power law models specified by the rms quadrupole normalisation amplitude @xmath10  and a spectral index @xmath11 as in grski et al .",
    "the cosmological implications of the foreground corrections as reappraised in this work are discussed in section  [ sec : results_cmb ] .    in order to quantify the uncertainty in the h@xmath0  template resulting from dust absorption ,",
    "we generate corrected h@xmath0  templates for three values of @xmath73  0.0 , 0.5 and 1.0  which are then fitted successively to the data over the full @xmath10 , @xmath11 grid of cosmological models , and also test templates corrected assuming values of @xmath73 running from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01 for a scale - invariant spectrum with @xmath10  @xmath2318  @xmath2k . since the correction is non - linear in @xmath73 ( see section  [ sec : ff_template ] ) , modifications to the template are made _ before _ convolution with the appropriate beam response , at the 1  effective angular resolution of the h@xmath0  template ( see section  [ sec : results_dmr_ff ] for full discussion ) .",
    "we also analyse the dmr and 19.2 ghz data after correction for free - free emission using the h@xmath0  templates scaled by the factors given in table  4 of dickinson et al .",
    "this enables us to test the impact of cross - talk between the templates , which is likely to be present at some level due to the large - scale cosecant variation with latitude of the galactic emission present in each template ( see section  [ sec : results_19ghz ] ) .",
