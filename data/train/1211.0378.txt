    "actinide based materials possess interesting physical behaviors due to the existence of 5@xmath3 electrons and have attracted extensive attentions @xcite , among which the actinide dioxides ( ano@xmath1 ) have been investigated most widely . at their ground state ,",
    "all actinide dioxides crystallize in face - centered - cubic ( caf@xmath1-like ) structure . in this arrangement , each actinide atom , located at the center of an oxygen cube , is expected in the ionic limit to yield four of its electrons to the surrounding oxygen atoms .",
    "this would lead to formal integer 5@xmath3 orbital populations ranging from @xmath4 ( th ) to @xmath5 ( fm ) . among the dioxide series , puo@xmath1 and",
    "amo@xmath1 occupy the intermediate zone , before puo@xmath1 ( tho@xmath1 @xmath6 npo@xmath1 ) the 5@xmath3 electronic states appear as localized states above the oxygen-2@xmath2 states , while after amo@xmath1 ( cmo@xmath1 @xmath6 fmo@xmath1 ) the 5@xmath3 electronic states appear as localized states below the oxygen-2@xmath2 states .",
    "thus the actinide 5@xmath3 electronic states in amo@xmath1 as well as in puo@xmath1 have the largest overlap with oxygen-2@xmath2 states .",
    "however , different from the widespread researches on puo@xmath1 @xcite , amo@xmath1 have received very few theoretical concerns until now . therefore following our previous systematic investigations on the ground - state properties and high - pressure behaviors of puo@xmath1 @xcite , here",
    "we further investigate the corresponding physical properties of amo@xmath1 .",
    "another reason for a thorough study of amo@xmath1 is its important role played in the latest nuclear reactor fuels . during the burning cycle of uo@xmath1 in conventional fission nuclear reactors ,",
    "some considerable amounts of plutonium and neptunium isotopes , as well as smaller quantities of minor actinides such as am , cm , bk , and cf , emerge in the reaction waste @xcite . since such radioactive waste results in very troublesome long - term storage requirements",
    ", it is then suggested that the produced transuranium element dioxides could be reprocessed from the burnt fuel and used as alternative fuel in a new generation of reactors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of these dioxides also need to be investigated and presented .",
    "similar to our previous theoretical studies on puo@xmath1 @xcite and npo@xmath1 @xcite , here we will systematically obtain various physical properties of amo@xmath1 and compare them with attainable experiments as well as possible .",
    "different physical properties of amo@xmath1 have been investigated in experiments ever since 1969 @xcite .",
    "the earlier magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that amo@xmath1 undergoes antiferromagnetic transition at 8.5@xmath70.5 k @xcite .",
    "recently , along with the development of computing abilities and numerical methods for applying quantum mechanics calculations , more and more theoretical researches are now being carried out on multi - phase properties of different actinide dioxides .",
    "although problems still exist like on the ground - state magnetic orders @xcite , many theoretically obtained physical properties of dioxides like uo@xmath1 and puo@xmath1 already accord very well with experiments .",
    "for example , the optical spectrum of uo@xmath1 given by employing the density functional theory ( dft ) + @xmath0 method @xcite is well consistent with the optical reflectance measurement @xcite , which has inspired experimentalist @xcite to choose the dft+@xmath0 results of puo@xmath1 @xcite as a criteria in determining the melting temperature of this material . also remarkably , the dft+@xmath0 predicted phonon spectrum of puo@xmath1 @xcite has been confirmed by the most recent experimental report @xcite . based on these previous successes , in the present paper",
    "we intend to reveal the ground - state properties for amo@xmath1 , including electronic , mechanical , and thermodynamic aspects , as well as its high - pressure behaviors .",
    "our dft calculations are carried out using the vienna _ ab initio _",
    "simulations package ( vasp ) @xcite with the projected - augmented - wave ( paw ) potential methods @xcite .",
    "the exchange and correlation effects are described by local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) form @xcite .",
    "the plane - wave basis set is limited by an energy cutoff of 500 ev .",
    "integrations over the brillouin zone of the cubic cell containing 4 americium and 8 oxygen atoms are done on a 9@xmath89@xmath89 @xmath9 points mesh generated by the monkhorst - pack @xcite method , which is sufficient for an energy convergence of less than 1.0@xmath810@xmath10 ev per atom .",
    "the strong on - site coulomb repulsion among the localized americium 5@xmath3 electrons is described by the dft+@xmath0 formalism formulated by dudarev _",
    "_ @xcite . in this method",
    ", only the difference between the spherically averaged screened coulomb energy @xmath0 and the exchange energy @xmath11 is significant for the total lda / gga energy functional . and",
    "in this paper , the coulomb @xmath0 is treated as a variable , while the exchange energy is set to be a constant @xmath11=0.75 ev . since only the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath11 is significant , thus , we will henceforth label them as one single parameter , labeled as @xmath0 for simplicity , while keeping in mind that the nonzero @xmath11 has been used during calculations .    in order to calculate the elastic constants for amo@xmath1 , we enforced small strains on the equilibrium cubic cell . for small strain @xmath12 ,",

    "3(d ) and 3(e ) .",
    "one can see that with increasing the tensile strains along all the three directions , the energies increase with inflexions . by differentiating the energy - strain curves",
    ", we find the inflexion points along the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions to be the strain values of 0.42 , 0.24 , and 0.18 respectively . at these strain values ,",

    "since the stress - strain curves change from upward into downward at these inflexion points , the stress maxima values are regarded as the theoretical tensile strengths . clearly along the three low - index directions ,",
    "the [ 100 ] direction has the largest , while the [ 111 ] direction has the smallest tensile strength .",
    "this result is similar to what we have found in another actinide dioxide puo@xmath1 @xcite",
    ". we can also understand this result from chemical bonding analysis . along the [ 100 ] direction , there are eight am - o bonds per formula unit for fluorite amo@xmath1 , and the angle of all eight bonds with respect to the pulling direction is 45@xmath80 . in comparison , along the [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions",
    "only four and two am - o bonds make an angle of 45@xmath80 with the pulling direction .",
    "the other four bonds along the [ 110 ] direction are vertical to the pulling direction , while the other six bonds make an angle of about 70.5@xmath80 with the pulling direction .",
    "it is evident that the bonds vertical to the pulling direction have no contributions to the tensile strength , and the bonds parallel to the pulling direction are easy to fracture under tensile deformation .",
    "therefore , the tensile strength along the [ 100 ] direction is stronger than that along other two directions .",
    "along all the three direction , no structural transition has been observed under external strains in our present study .",
    "besides , we note that the stress in [ 110 ] direction experiences an abrupt decrease process after strain up to 0.24 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the corresponding four am - o bonds making an angle of 45@xmath80 with the pulling direction have been pulled to fracture under that strain . in comparison with puo@xmath1 @xcite",
    ", we can see that the theoretical tensile strengths of amo@xmath1 are much smaller along all the three low - index directions , indicating that amo@xmath1 is easier to get deformed during tensile processes .      to our knowledge ,",
    "no experimental or theoretical phonon frequency results have been published for amo@xmath1 . here",
    "we carry out the first theoretical try in obtaining its phonon dispersion curves , as well as thermodynamic properties .",
    "the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) and a 2@xmath82@xmath82 supercell containing 96 atoms is adopted to calculate the force constants of amo@xmath1 .",
    "since our previously obtained phonon dispersion curves result by using the same methods for puo@xmath1 accords moderately well with subsequent experimental measurements , we are confident that our present results for amo@xmath1 can be effective to certain degrees .",
    "the born effective charges are firstly calculated to reveal the dielectric properties of amo@xmath1 , and to modify the lo - to ( longitudinal optical and transverse optical branches of phonon ) splitting effects . for fluorite amo@xmath1 ,",
    "the effective charge tensors for both am and o are isotropic because of their position symmetry . after calculation , the born effective charges of am and o ions are found to be @xmath81 = 4.51 and @xmath82 = @xmath362.26 , respectively , within gga+@xmath0 formalism with the choice of @xmath0=4.0 ev .",

    "there are three atoms ( one am and two o atoms ) .",
    "therefore , nine branches of phonon dispersion curves exist .",
    "one can see that the lo - to splitting at @xmath83 point becomes evident by the inclusion of polarization effects .",
    "in addition , due to the fact that americium atom is heavier than oxygen atom , the vibration frequency of americium atom is lower than that of oxygen atom . as a consequence",
    ", the phonon density of states for amo@xmath1 can be viewed as two parts , as shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "@xcite at the temperature range from 300 to 500 k. as temperature further increases , the discrepancy between our result and the experimental values @xcite become larger .",
    "we conclude that the disagreement of @xmath88 between theory and experiments in the high temperature range mainly originates from the qha we used .",

    "lattice volumes , we can further calculate the grneisen parameters for each vibration mode of amo@xmath1 .",
    "our obtained grneisen parameters at different @xmath9 points are shown in fig .",
    "7 . due to the fact that after lattice expansion , atomic interactions are weakened and phonon frequencies are lowered , the grneisen parameters are positive for almost all phonon branches .",
    "the only exception lies around the w point , where the grneisen parameter for the second acoustic branch of phonon has a small negative value .",
    "this result comes from the coupling behavior of the two lowest - frequency acoustic phonon branches at the w point .",
    "after lattice expansion , the coupling disappears and the dispersion curves of these two branches separate with each other , causing that the frequency of the higher branch moves upward . as a result ,",
    "the grneisen parameters for this phonon branch have small negative values around the w point .",
    "we have explained above that the umklapp scattering @xmath91 is proportional to @xmath92 , thus , the grneisen parameter provide an estimate of the strength of anharmonicity in a compound .",
    "one can see from fig . 7",
    "that the two transverse acoustic branches of phonons have the largest grneisen parameters , indicating that these two branches are most anharmonic and interact with the longitudinal acoustic mode strongly . in order to describe quantitatively the anharmonic effects , we further calculate the average grneisen parameter ( @xmath93 ) for the three acoustic vibration modes by using the similar method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath94 . for amo@xmath1 , the values of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 are 2.75 , 2.48 , and 2.16 , respectively . and the average @xmath93 of the three acoustic modes",
    "is then calculated to be 2.46 .",
