    "for over a decade , my coworkers and i have been developing a shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory of plastic deformation in noncrystalline solids . @xcite our goal has been to construct a phenomenological description of amorphous plasticity based on physical principles and molecular models , and yet simple enough to be useful for predicting the performance of real materials . at the molecular level , amorphous solids are structurally no more complicated than fluids .",
    "they do , of course , exhibit highly non - fluidlike properties  rigidity , jamming , and the like .",
    "nevertheless , their underlying simplicity implies that their behaviors might exhibit some degree of universality .",
    "my purpose in this paper is to move the stz theory further toward such a description . in particular ,",
    "i propose to start with a few basic features of a flow - defect theory of amorphous plasticity and then to see how far it is possible to go using primarily symmetry , conservation laws , and thermodynamics .    from its inception @xcite",
    ", the stz theory was intended to be an extension of the flow - defect theories of turnbull , cohen , spaepen , argon and others @xcite in which localized deformable clusters of molecules allow noncrystalline solids to undergo irreversible shear strains in response to applied stresses .",
    "the reformulation of the stz theory presented here is motivated primarily by the emergence of the effective disorder temperature as a key internal state variable in nonequilibrium theories of amorphous plasticity .",
    "the dynamic role of the effective temperature has been explored in remarkable detail recently by haxton and liu @xcite in their extensive molecular - dynamics simulations of a simple , two - dimensional glass forming material .",
    "much of the content of the present paper was developed during the attempt by manning and myself @xcite to interpret the haxton - liu data .",
    "the relation between the population of stz s ( or flow defects ) and an intensive variable such as the effective temperature has a long history .",
    "earlier investigators , notably cohen and turnbull @xcite and spaepen @xcite , described the intrinsically disordered state of noncrystalline materials by a free volume @xmath0 .",
    "those authors perceptively recognized that the relevant definition of @xmath0 is not as an extensive excess volume measured from some densely packed state , but as an intensive quantity  the inverse of the derivative of the configurational entropy ( i.e. the entropy associated with molecular configurations , without kinetic contributions ) with respect to the volume .",
    "thus they proposed that the density of flow defects be proportional to a boltzmann - like factor , @xmath1 , and not just to @xmath0 itself .    in @xcite",
    ", i argued that the appropriate generalization of free volume in plasticity theory is an effective temperature @xmath2 that characterizes the state of configurational disorder in the system .",
    "in analogy to @xmath0 , @xmath2 is the inverse of the derivative of the configurational entropy with respect to configurational energy .",
    "@xmath2 equilibrates to the ambient temperature @xmath3 at high @xmath3 , but may fall out of equilibrium at low @xmath3 where disorder is generated by the molecular rearrangements that accompany mechanical deformation . throughout this paper , as in @xcite , i define @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a characteristic stz formation energy , so that the stz density is proportional to @xmath6 . this is a direct analog of the free - volume formula and , in fact , reduces to it in the case of a system under constant pressure with a positive `` effective '' thermal expansion coefficient .    with this definition of @xmath7 , the `` bottom line '' of the analysis to be presented here",
    "is that the stz theory  in most but not all circumstances  can be reduced to an expression for the plastic part of the rate - of - deformation tensor , @xmath8 supplemented by an equation of motion for @xmath7 , which appears here only in the boltzmann - like prefactor . in eq.([d - chi - s ] ) , @xmath9 is the deviatoric stress tensor and @xmath3 is the bath temperature .",
    "the tensor function @xmath10 contains all the dynamical details pertaining to stz transitions ; the prefactor @xmath6 determines the density of stz s .",
    "this clean separation between the @xmath9 and @xmath7 dependence of the plastic strain rate was emphasized by shi et al .",
    "@xcite as a characteristic feature of the stz theory",
    ". it is derived here in section [ stzequations ] ; and the equation of motion for @xmath7 is derived in section [ teff ] .",
    "this paper starts , in sec.[stzbasics ] , with a reexamination of the basic assumptions upon which the stz theory is constructed .",
    "the stz equations of motion are derived in section [ stzequations ] , and a general expression for the yield stress is derived and interpreted in section [ yieldstress ] .",
    "the latter result brings new physical insight to the choice of material - specific quantities such as the stz transition rates .",
    "sections [ viscosity ] and [ teff ] , respectively , contain a derivation of the stz formula for the newtonian viscosity and a discussion of effective - temperature dynamics . as a way of putting all these concepts together in a realistic context ,",
    "the main part of the paper concludes in sec .",
    "[ metglass ] with a reexamination of the extensive set of rheological measurements of a bulk metallic glass by lu et .",
    "al . , @xcite .",
    "that reexamination , a reworking of @xcite and @xcite , serves as a test of the stz dynamics , confirming that system parameters obtained from steady - state properties such as the viscosity can be used to predict transient behaviors .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] contains a few brief remarks about outstanding problems .",
    "the starting point for all of the analysis in this paper is a dynamic model of a noncrystalline material in which a disordered arrangement of molecules ( or bubbles , or sand grains , etc . )",
    "interact with each other via short ranged forces .",
    "this system is subject to driving forces that cause it to deform and , in some circumstances , to flow continuously .",
    "it is dynamic in the sense that it possesses an intrinsic time scale , say @xmath11 , that characterizes the rate at which it responds to microscopic perturbations . in molecular materials",
    ", @xmath11 is an internal vibration period of order femtoseconds .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to understand the mechanism by which these fast , molecular interactions generate viscous responses on time scales of order seconds or longer .    to construct a theory of amorphous plasticity for such a model ,",
    "i have found it useful to watch computer - generated , moving pictures of its behavior as it undergoes slow , steady , shear deformation .",
    "these pictures can be found on the websites of the authors of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their most striking feature is that the irreversible molecular rerrangements are sporadic , short lived , spatially isolated events .",
    "these are the stz transitions .",
    "they occur within a persistently noisy environment in which thermally and mechanically generated fluctuations bring groups of molecules into and out of configurations in which they can undergo irreversible shear transformations .",
    "that is , the fluctuations create and annihilate stz s . at low temperatures , below the glass transition",
    ", rearrangements are driven primarily by the applied stress ; and an stz , once formed , rapidly undergoes a shear transition if it is aligned favorably with respect to the stress . at higher temperatures and small driving forces , i.e. in the viscous regime above the glass transition ,",
    "stz transitions are thermally driven and the applied stress simply biases them the direction of the average plastic shear rate . in either limit ,",
    "the stz transitions are rare inelastic events occurring within an otherwise solidlike elastic material .",
    "it is especially easy to observe stz rearrangements in two - dimensional models , where their cores are t1 events in which two nearest - neighbor molecules move away from each other and two next - nearest neighbors come together .",
    "no two stz transitions ever seem to look exactly the same .",
    "the t1 events at their cores occur at varying angles with respect to the shear direction ; and varying numbers of nearby molecules participate in the overall motions .",
    "this statistical variability of the stz s is clearly due to the fluctuating environment in which they are being created and annihilated .",
    "experimental observations of memory effects in simple amorphous materials tell us that the stz s can not be structureless objects .",
    "the bauschinger effect is one example where the system remembers the direction in which it has been deformed , and responds differently  more compliantly or less so  to further loading in different directions .",
    "the natural way to include such effects in the theory is to let the stz s possess internal degrees of freedom that carry information from one event to the next .",
    "the simplest such possibility is to assume that , during their lifetimes , the stz s are dynamic , anisotropic objects whose populations and orientations are determined by the loading history .",
    "once a shear transformation occurs in some direction , the molecules that composed the stz resist further shear in the original direction but may be especially susceptible to a reverse shear .",
    "that is , the first transition redistributes the local stresses in such a way as to favor a reverse transition if the stress changes sign .",
    "there is no strong requirement that the reverse transition bring the molecules back to exactly their original positions ; but it is this approximate picture that suggests a two - state model of stz s . the two - state behavior has been observed directly by lundberg et al .",
    "@xcite in parallel bubble - raft experiments and two - dimensional foam simulations .",
    "these authors find that a t1 event is often mechanically reversible ( although still dissipative ) if the direction of the applied shear is reversed shortly after the event occurs . on the other hand ,",
    "if the shear is not reversed until after other events have occurred nearby , then the memory is lost , i.e. the stz is annihilated .    thus , the two - state stz s are the memory carriers in amorphous materials . if they are randomly oriented and present in substantial numbers , the material is deformable in all directions because there are stz s available to respond to all directions of applied stress .",
    "if they are rare , deformation is difficult in any direction .",
    "if they are all oriented in the direction of a shear stress , then further deformation in that direction is impossible  the material is jammed  but response to a reverse stress is relatively easy .",
    "annihilation of existing stz s and creation of new ones without orientational bias are the mechanisms by which memory is lost in these systems .    during its lifetime , each stz has two preferred spatial orientations .",
    "one of these orientations , say the `` @xmath12 '' state , will be closest to the direction of the deviatoric stress tensor @xmath9 and therefore most stable . in two dimensions , the other stz state ,",
    "say `` @xmath13 '' , is perpendicular to the first and is therefore least stable with respect to @xmath9 but most stable with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "the situation is more complicated in three dimensions where the two stz states need not be symmetrically oriented with respect to @xmath9 ; but it must still be true that , except in very special cases , if we are given a stress tensor @xmath9 and a pair of stz orientations , we can identify the `` @xmath15 '' orientations unambiguously .      the first two , entropy conserving terms on the right - hand side of eq.([ndot ] ) describe the rates at which the stz s transform between their `` @xmath12 '' and `` @xmath13 '' states .",
    "@xmath20 is the rate of transitions from `` @xmath13 '' to `` @xmath12 '' , and @xmath21 is the projection of @xmath9 onto the axes defined by @xmath16 , . by symmetry ,",
    "the rate of reverse transitions is @xmath22 .",
    "the second pair of terms on the right - hand side describes the rate of stz creation and annihilation . here",
    ", @xmath23 is an attempt frequency , i.e. a noise strength , consisting of incoherent mechanical and thermal parts , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the exponential function @xmath26 is the _ a priori _ probability of occurence of a state with energy @xmath27 ; and @xmath28 is a reference density of order an inverse molecular volume .",
    "@xmath24 is a measure of the strength of the mechanically generated noise that accompanies plastic deformation ; it vanishes when the driving force @xmath9 is absent . an explicit expression for @xmath24",
    "will be derived in sec .",
    "[ stzequations ] .",
    "@xmath25 is the super - arrhenius part of the rate of thermally activated molecular rearrangements .",
    "its molecular origin lies at the heart of any theory of the glass transition , and is discussed in detail  albeit quite speculatively  in my paper on an  excitation - chain theory of glass dynamics .",
    "@xcite @xmath25 vanishes when @xmath3 is less than the glass transition temperature @xmath29 and is equal to unity when @xmath3 is above the super - arrhenius region , say , @xmath30 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath31 where @xmath32 vanishes for @xmath33 and diverges , perhaps like @xmath34 , as @xmath3 approaches @xmath29 from above . when there is no external driving and the effective temperature @xmath35 equilibrates to @xmath3 , the stz creation rate is proportional to @xmath36 $ ] , which is the `` @xmath37 '' relaxation rate .",
    "importantly , the activation energy appearing here is the sum of arrhenius and super - arrhenius parts , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively",
    ".    two aspects of eq.([ndot ] ) require extra attention .",
    "first , note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are assumed to be independent of the stz label @xmath17 ; they are noise strengths that apply equally to all molecular rearrangements .",
    "second , the creation and annihilation part of eq.([ndot ] ) is written as a single detailed - balance relation in which the equilibrium distribution always is proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath40 , with @xmath7 rather than @xmath3 in the exponent .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability of forming a configurational defect always is determined by the effective disorder temperature .",
    "the next order of business is to extract as much physical insight as possible from the structure of the stz theory summarized by eq.([ndot ] ) , making approximations that retain this structure , but without being specific about the model - dependent ingredients of the rate factor @xmath41 .      for two dimensional systems ,",
    "pechenik @xcite showed that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a unit vector at an angle @xmath16 relative to a principal axis of the stress , with @xmath50 .",
    "if this principal stress axis is at an angle , say @xmath51 , with respect to the @xmath52 axis , then @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the ( signed ) deviatoric stress . throughout the following discussion ,",
    "i adopt the convention that positive values of @xmath54 denote stresses in the direction that drives `` @xmath13 '' to `` @xmath12 '' transitions .",
    "the situation is more complicated in three dimensions where the tensor @xmath46 must contain more than just directional information .",
    "note , for example , that we need two stress values plus three angles to specify the deviatoric stress tensor @xmath9 .",
    "since the tensorial versions of the stz equations to be used here must look the same in three as in two dimensions , i omit the detailed three dimensional analysis .    in principle",
    ", we should solve eq.([ndot ] ) separately for the @xmath18 at each @xmath16 and each @xmath17 , and then use those @xmath18 to evaluate @xmath42 in eq.([dpl1 ] ) .",
    "the results of such a calculation may be important in some situations .",
    "for example , the distribution over orientations @xmath16 may be quantitatively relevant when the system is driven strongly away from equilibrium or when the orientation of the stress changes abruptly in time .",
    "similarly , at small stresses , the sum over stz thresholds implied by @xmath55 determines the extent of plastic deformation ; only the stz s with low thresholds undergo transitions before the system becomes jammed .",
    "such calculations , however , would be more laborious than is necessary for most practical purposes .",
    "note especially that only a narrow range of stz thresholds is likely to be dynamically relevant .",
    "stz s with anomalously low thresholds will have large formation energies and therefore be very rare ; that is , they will be suppressed by the weight factor implicit in @xmath55 . on the other hand , stz s with high transition thresholds",
    "will not contribute appreciably to the deformation rate ; they will be suppressed by the rate factor @xmath20 .",
    "thus the sum over @xmath17 seems likely to be dominated by stz s with a single characteristic formation energy that already has been denoted by @xmath56 .        with these definitions , the plastic rate of deformation tensor in eq.([dpl1 ] ) becomes @xmath71.\\ ] ] then return to the master equation for the stz densities , eq.([ndot ] ) , to deduce equations of motion for @xmath72 and @xmath59 .",
    "our assumption about a narrow range of relevant values of @xmath17 , e.g. thresholds , means that we write @xmath73 , so that all the relevant stz formation energies are of order @xmath74 as anticipated in the definition of @xmath7 . using the preceding definitions of @xmath72 and @xmath59 , we find @xmath75-{m_{ij}\\,\\gamma^{tot}\\over\\lambda}\\,e^{-1/\\chi};\\ ] ] and @xmath76 where @xmath77    the variables @xmath59 and @xmath72 , and the roles that they play in eqs.([dpl2 ] - [ dotlambda ] ) , immediately tell us a great deal about the nature of the stz theory .",
    "@xmath59 is the fraction of molecular sites occupied by stz s . to be consistent with the assumption of dilute , weakly interacting stz s , @xmath59 must be small , no larger than @xmath78 , and usually very much smaller .",
    "the deviatoric tensor @xmath72 is the average stz orientation . by definition ,",
    "its magnitude is less than or equal to unity . in eq.([dpl2 ] ) , @xmath72 plays the role of a back stress , consistent with the idea that stz s already aligned in the direction of the stress impede further deformation in that direction .",
    "the fact that the rate factor @xmath79 is a non - negative , monotonically increasing function of its argument means that @xmath80 is a monotonic function of @xmath66 that vanishes when @xmath81 .",
    "its magnitude , like that of @xmath72 , is bounded by unity .",
    "we also deduce from eqs.([dpl2 ] - [ dotlambda ] ) that there are two qualitatively different time scales in the stz theory . the plastic strain rate determined by eq.([dpl2 ] )",
    "is a rate per unit volume ; it is proportional to the small quantity @xmath59 because it scales with the density of stz s .",
    "no prefactors @xmath59 appear in the expressions for @xmath82 and @xmath83 on the right - hand sides of eqs.([dotm ] ) and ( [ dotlambda ] ) .",
    "these equations describe how individual stz s respond to changes in their environments , and the fact that @xmath59 is missing as a prefactor in those equations implies that @xmath72 and @xmath59 respond to perturbations much more rapidly than does the rate of plastic deformation .",

    "the time derivative @xmath85 must be proportional to the rate per unit volume at which configurational entropy is generated during plastic deformation ; thus , like @xmath42 , the expression for @xmath85 must contain a prefactor @xmath59 .      determining the rate factor @xmath86 that first appears here in eq.([ndot ] ) has been one of the most challenging problems in the stz theory .",
    "this factor has been chosen incorrectly in much of the earlier literature in the field . in our original stz paper @xcite ,",
    "falk and i used an expression for @xmath86 that turns out to be correct at sufficiently low temperatures ; but we did not propose a systematic rationale for it .",
    "the problem was solved by pechenik @xcite , who showed that @xmath86 can be determined by thermodynamic arguments alone .",
    "pechenik argued that the symmetry preserving and physically intuitive way to determine @xmath86 is to assume that it is proportional to the rate at which the work of deformation is dissipated irreversibly , and thus is converted into the disordered configurational fluctuations that create and annihilate stz s .",
    "this assumption determines @xmath86 uniquely if one invokes the second law of thermodynamics by requiring that this dissipation rate be non - negative .",
    "the argument starts by writing the first law of thermodynamics in the form ( using summation convention ) : @xmath87\\,s_{ij}\\cr & = & { d\\over dt}\\,\\psi(\\lambda , m_{ij } ) + { \\cal q}(s_{ij},\\lambda , m_{ij}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the left - hand side of eq.([energybalance ] ) is the rate per unit volume at which plastic work is done by the stress @xmath88 . on the right - hand side",
    ", @xmath89 is the recoverable , state - dependent , internal energy density associated with the stz s .",
    "@xmath89 must be proportional to the density of stz s ; therefore it is convenient to write it in the form : @xmath90 because @xmath91 is a scalar function of just @xmath72 , it must depend only on @xmath92 .",
    "also assume that the effective temperature @xmath7 is so slowly varying compared to @xmath59 and @xmath72 that it may for the moment be taken to be a constant , and need not be included as an explicit argument of the internal - energy function @xmath89 .",
    "the last term on the right - hand side of eq.([energybalance ] ) , i.e. @xmath93 , is the energy dissipation rate per unit volume .",
    "pechenik s hypothesis is that @xmath86 is proportional to the rate of energy dissipation per stz .",
    "that is , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an as yet undetermined factor with the dimensions of stress .",
    "at this stage in the development , it is useful to take advantage of the fact that @xmath59 relaxes so rapidly that we may replace it in the preceding formulas by its steady - state value , @xmath106 , and let @xmath107 by definition , @xmath80 vanishes at @xmath81 and goes smoothly to @xmath108 as @xmath109 .",
    "therefore @xmath110 vanishes like @xmath111 at @xmath112 and diverges at @xmath113 .",
    "so long as @xmath114 remains in the range , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 , the denominator @xmath117 in eq.([gammatotal ] ) remains positive as required .",

    "then @xmath133 and @xmath134 , so that @xmath135 this relation between the stz production rate and the applied power density has been confirmed recently by heggen et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of conventional flow - defect theories .",
    "one of the most notable features of the stz theory is the natural way in which a yield stress emerges from its basic structure . to see this ,",
    "consider the case where the bath temperature @xmath3 is below the glass transition , so that the spontaneous stz annihilation and creation rates , proportional to @xmath25 , both vanish .",
    "this condition does not necessarily mean that the transition rate @xmath136 vanishes , as assumed in the strictly athermal version of the stz theory.@xcite thermal fluctuations may induce backward stz transitions even when the system is in a completely inviscid glassy state , i.e. when it has infinite linear shear viscosity  which is the only situation in which there is a sharply defined yield stress .",

    "in fact , we do not know whether any characteristic stress appearing in @xmath79 is related to @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , simply inserting a physically motivated choice of @xmath95 into both @xmath79 and eq.([sy ] ) , while perhaps sensible , evades the basic question . in principle",

    "specifically , this analysis seems to be a stringent test of the assumption that the rates of change of stz populations are determined by the rate at which disorder is generated during deformation , and the accompanying idea that disorder in amorphous materials is accurately described by an effective temperature .",
    "i close by stating just a few brief opinions about open questions and further directions for research .    as implied in the text",
    ", i think that the least well developed element of the theory presented in this paper is the derivation of the thermal entropy - production term , @xmath319 , given in eq.([sctherm ] ) .",
    "this term seems likely to be strongly model dependent because it involves more than just the stz degrees of freedom .",
    "it also may control some especially interesting physical properties such as shear - band formation .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental theoretical challenge is to understand the limits of validity of the stz theory .",
    "how and when does it break down at high deformation rates ? or during large excursions from steady state behavior where the separation of time scales described in sec .",
    "[ stzequations ] becomes invalid ? we know",
    "that , at some point , strongly driven amorphous materials must change from deforming slowly like solids to flowing rapidly like liquids . where and how does this happen ? manning and",
    "i may have seen a clue in @xcite , where it appears that the effective temperature diverges at a large but finite strain rate of order @xmath196 .",
    "this line of investigation has been opened by the work of haxton and liu @xcite .",
    "more simulations and experiments along these lines should be very interesting .",
    "looking from a broader point of view , i have argued elsewhere @xcite that a principal goal of research in solid mechanics ought to be to bridge the gap between atomistic physics and engineering practice .",
    "my prime example of how far behind we are in this area is fracture mechanics .",
    "it is well known that advancing cracks undergo instabilities that are qualitatively similar to sidebranching instabilities in dendritic crystal growth .",
    "the latter instabilities have been well understood for about half a century , and that insight has provided the basis for major advances in solidification processing . as yet , we have no comparable understanding of the analogous instabilities in fracture . in @xcite , i suggested a way in which plasticity theory might be brought to bear on this problem ; but , at that time , the stz theory was not well enough developed for much progress to be made .",
    "we are now beginning , in @xcite for example , to understand in an stz context how driven amorphous materials may become unstable against spatially nonuniform deformations such as shear bands .",
    "reference @xcite is explicitly an attempt to move in the direction of ordinary fracture .",
    "the stz theory ought to be relevant at least to slow , ductile failure in either shearing or tensile modes .",
    "can it also predict the behavior of fast brittle cracks ?",
    "this research was supported by doe grant number de - fg03 - 99er45762 .",
