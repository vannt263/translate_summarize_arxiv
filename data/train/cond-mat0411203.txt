    "the continual investigation and development of heterostructures consisting of layered ferromagnet ( @xmath0 ) and superconductor ( @xmath1 ) compounds at nanometer length scales has captured the interest of researchers in a broad range of disciplines .",
    "the reasons for this stem from the distinctive properties of these nano - sized materials , modified from those of their bulk counterparts , related to the effects induced by the mutual coupling that occurs when superconductors and ferromagnets are in close electrical contact . the advancement of nanofabrication techniques is partly responsible for the maintained interest thus far , where electron - beam lithography , etching and lift - off methods , to name a few , have been refined to allow for the well controlled creation of relatively clean multiple layers involving @xmath5 junctions .",
    "further developments in experimental probes such as the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) , have also progressed to the point where @xmath6ev energy resolution can be obtained at very low temperatures@xcite . when operating in spectroscopy mode , the stm gives fine atomic - scale details of the local density of states ( ldos ) of inhomogeneous superconducting systems .",
    "in contrast to conventional tunnel junctions , where transport measurements are taken , the stm gives localized spatial information not averaged out over the extent of the entire sample@xcite .",
    "for composite materials comprised of multiple superconductor layers separated by ferromagnet materials , the presence of the magnetic @xmath0 regions induces a splitting of the fermi surfaces of the different spin bands , and leads to spin - dependent andreev@xcite states .",
    "the degree of spin - polarization in the superconductor and the induced pairing correlations in the ferromagnet are all components that embody what are known as proximity effects .",
    "it turns out that due to the mutual interaction between the two contrasting materials and the inherent system inhomogeneity , the pair amplitude , becomes spatially varying@xcite , and its phase difference @xmath7 can modulate between successive @xmath1 layers . for certain configurations",
    ", there can be ( at zero applied magnetic field ) a phase difference of @xmath8 between @xmath1 layers separated by a ferromagnet@xcite .",
    "these are the so - called @xmath4 junctions , which occur in the simplest case , in a 3-layer @xmath2 type structure .",
    "junctions of this type can also occur in different combinations for more complicated@xcite layered heterostructures , where the relative sign of the pair potential @xmath9 can change between adjacent @xmath1 layers .",
    "the proximity effect is then responsible for the existence of a number of stable junction configurations of the pair amplitude in @xmath5 multilayers@xcite : the oscillatory behavior of the superconducting correlations in each ferromagnet and the spatial profile of the pair amplitude in the superconductor are closely interconnected , often resulting in a nontrivial spatial dependence of the magnitude and phase of the order parameter .",
    "this consequently implies that the one - particle energy spectrum , or density of states ( dos ) , will have an equally interesting behavior .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the dos in structures consisting of a single ferromagnet and superconductor has been addressed in past work . in the diffusive , dirty - limit case",
    ", the damped - oscillatory decay of the pair amplitude in the @xmath0 region induces a spatial variation of the ldos@xcite . for a clean @xmath5 system with rough boundaries , the tunneling dos as a function of energy",
    "revealed certain inversion signatures that depended on the thickness of the ferromagnet film @xcite .",
    "the energy gap in @xmath5 hybrid systems becomes rapidly suppressed , in a manner that depends on the ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fermi energies , interfacial scattering strength , and @xmath0 layer thickness@xcite .",
    "the depletion of the gap has also been discussed in the context of a potential spin - valve device @xcite . the spatially averaged dos was calculated for a clean 2-d @xmath5 box geometry@xcite , as was the ldos for 3-d hybrid @xmath5 nanostructures@xcite , where there was a reported filling in of the gap with increased @xmath0 layer thickness .",
    "the damped oscillatory phenomena of the dos is expected to persist over a broad range of material parameters @xcite . for an @xmath2 type structure ,",
    "the proximity effect can lead to a modification of the ldos that depends solely on the phase difference of the superconductors@xcite .",
    "it was shown by using a two - band model for ferromagnetism , that the ldos for a @xmath5 bilayer still maintained the characteristic damped oscillations , with however , an increased wavelength and sharper decline @xcite .",
    "certain @xmath5 bilayers with unconventional @xmath10-wave superconductors have also been investigated for peculiar characteristics of the dos @xcite .",
    "thus , while the dos and ldos of @xmath5 bilayers have been investigated , as have also to some extent @xmath2 junctions , work analyzing the ldos of junctions consisting of more than three layers is still scarce .",
    "it is imperative therefore to have a theory valid for these multilayers , since as potential device applications and experimental techniques become more advanced , the creation of complicated sequences of @xmath4-junctions will become increasingly realizable .",
    "much of the somewhat limited experimental work on the dos in @xmath5 heterostructures is based on transport measurements .",
    "direct evidence of the oscillatory behavior of the superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet was found through tunneling spectroscopy measurements that showed inversions in the dos for a thin ferromagnet film @xcite .",
    "modifications to the dos in the superconductor also give insight in describing the proximity effect , by providing information on the influence of the ferromagnet on superconducting correlations .",
    "it was found that the dos in the vicinity of the interface of the superconductor is substantially modified from the bulk bcs result@xcite .",
    "recently , local spectroscopy revealed the ldos for a few different ferromagnet thicknesses @xcite : the reported inversion of the dos was attributed to the @xmath4 state .",
    "some other relevant experiments involving the ground state behavior of @xmath4-junctions have shown that both the @xmath11 or @xmath4 state can occur , depending on the width @xmath12 of the @xmath0 layer@xcite .",
    "the origin of the damped oscillatory behavior reflected in dos measurements and calculations discussed earlier is responsible , in some cases , for the damped oscillations in the critical current @xmath13 as a function of @xmath0 layer width , suggesting a @xmath11 to @xmath4 transition@xcite .",
    "the signature in the characteristic @xmath13 curves also indicates a crossover from the @xmath11 to @xmath4 phase in going from higher to lower temperatures@xcite .",
    "the current phase relation was also measured@xcite , demonstrating a re - entrant @xmath13 with temperature variation .    despite the existence of this experimental work",
    ", little attention has been paid until very recently to discussing , from a thermodynamic point of view , the relative stability of the different possible configurations involving @xmath11 and @xmath4 junctions in @xmath14 heterostructures . indeed ,",
    "a recent preprint@xcite complains of the complete absence of work on thermodynamic properties of such structures .",
    "we have alleviated this situation in very recent work@xcite , where we have found a way to correctly evaluate the condensation free energy in these nanostructures as a function of the relevant parameters .",
    "the work that we discuss here involves discussing the ldos for junction configurations whose thermodynamic stability properties are@xcite well understood .",
    "the quasiparticle amplitudes and energies that ultimately govern all observable behavior are very sensitive to the geometry of the given @xmath5 system . for @xmath0 or @xmath1 layers a few nanometers thick , interference of the wavefunctions even over the atomic scale can produce significant contributions to the ldos .",
    "often the interaction potentials and geometry vary quite rapidly over the fermi wavelength , and averaging over the momentum space trajectories eliminates useful information on the quasiparticle dynamics .",
    "it is therefore preferred in the clean limit situation considered here , to implement a microscopic model which affords the most complete information regarding the local electronic structure .",
    "this requires going beyond the standard approximate equations , e.g. , the eilenberger equations , which are essentially transport differential equations that describe superconductivity in the quasiclassical regime . with the progressive strides made in local spectroscopy techniques ,",
    "a fully microscopic theory that allows inclusion of the details of the ldos at the atomic scale is necessary .",
    "furthermore the ground state properties of @xmath4 junctions can be analyzed properly only if the superconducting order parameter is calculated self - consistently .",
    "the theory used here satisfies these requirements .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the ldos for several possible multilayer structures .",
    "the existence of such structures as either local or global minima of the free energy was proved in ref .",
    "differing spectra are found depending on the exact nature of the particular junction configuration considered . by using an established fully microscopic method @xcite",
    ", we self - consistently calculate the pair potential , @xmath9 , revealing several permissible types of spatial arrangements of the order parameter .",
    "the quasiparticle wavefunctions and associated energies are obtained from the microscopic bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "a numerical algorithm is then used that permits the self - consistent calculation of the pair potential .",
    "we find differing signatures for the ldos that should be discernible in stm spectroscopy experiments .",
    "in this section we outline the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations @xcite that are appropriate for the investigations of @xmath5 multilayered junctions . since the bdg equations are inherently real - space based , they are especially convenient for the investigation of the possible spatial configurations of the pair amplitude and the spatially resolved ldos .",
    "we consider 3-d slab - like compounds translationally invariant in the @xmath15 plane , and with all spatial variations occurring in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "the structures consists of alternating superconducting , @xmath1 , and ferromagnetic , @xmath0 , layers , each of width @xmath17 and @xmath12 respectively .",

    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath40 characterizes the interfacial scattering strength .",
    "we consider here singlet pairing only and , consistent with this choice , we assume that the magnetic orientation in all magnetic layers , when more than one is present , is the same .    the nontrivial spatial dependence of the pair potential must be calculated in a self consistent manner by an appropriate sum over states : @xmath41\\tanh(\\epsilon_n/2t),\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the density of states ( dos ) per spin of the superconductor in the normal state , @xmath10 is the total system size in the @xmath16 direction , @xmath43 is the temperature , @xmath44 is the cutoff `` debye '' energy of the pairing interaction , and @xmath45 is the effective coupling , which we take to be a constant @xmath46 within the superconductor regions and zero elsewhere .",

    "we will mainly focus our study on these symmetric configurations .",

[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , with the same panel arrangements as in those figures , plotted as a function of the energy and of the mismatch parameter @xmath67 .",
    "]    in the next figure , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we repeat the previous study but in terms of the barrier height , rather than the mismatch . again , we plot in each panel the self consistent results obtained with initial guesses of the 0 and @xmath4 types , which means that all regions of the ( b ) panel correspond to self consistent @xmath4 states whereas those in the top panel correspond to 0 configurations , except for @xmath119 where no self consistent 0 state exists@xcite .",
    "we then plot instead results for the same @xmath4 state as in the bottom panel , which is reached by iteration of either an initial 0 or @xmath4 guess .",
    "again , the point where the transition occurs can be seen as a clear discontinuity in panel ( a ) .",
    "the difference between the dos for the two states where they coexist is in this case even more obvious than in the previous one , with the bcs like peaks being considerably higher for the @xmath4 configuration .",
    "it is also illustrative to display more clearly some of the features of the results by isolating some selected slices of the 3-d plots as 2-d line drawings .",
    "this we do in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in the top panel of this figure we present results for an @xmath2 trilayer , for two contrasting values of the mismatch parameter @xmath67 .",
    "results labeled as  0 \" and  @xmath4 \" are for the case where the self consistent states plotted are of these types .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath4 state curves corresponding to @xmath120 , where ( as shown above and in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the 0 state is barely metastable , have clearly distinct signatures , with a smaller gap opening for the @xmath11 state , and consequently more subgap quasiparticle states .",
    "consistent with this , when there is little mismatch one finds that the pair amplitude is relatively large in the @xmath0 layer . in agreement with what was seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , this progression takes a different form for the 0 and @xmath4 states , and this is reflected in this panel , as can see by careful comparison of the curves . in the bottom panel",
    "we demonstrate the effect of the barrier height .",
    "the results are displayed as in the top panel , but with the dimensionless height @xmath66 taking the place of the mismatch parameter .",
    "this figure should be viewed in conjunction with fig .",
    "one of the values of @xmath66 chosen ( @xmath121 ) is again such that the 0 state is@xcite barely metastable , while for the other value the 0 and @xmath4 states have similar condensation energies . for @xmath66 close to 0.32",
    "there is a marked contrast between the two plots , with the gap clearly opening wider and containing more structure for the @xmath4 state . at larger @xmath66",
    "the gap becomes larger in both cases , with the bcs - like peaks increasing in height .",
    "thus , as the barrier becomes larger , one is dealing with nearly independent superconducting slabs and the plots become more similar .",
    "the largest difference therefore occurs , as for the mismatch , at the intermediate values more likely to be found experimentally .     the normalized dos for the @xmath3 structure of figs .  [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig7 ] , plotted as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] except as a function of barrier height @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 . ]",
    "now we turn to the dos results for the seven layer structure . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we present results for the normalized local dos , defined as in the three layer case , as a function of energy and mismatch parameter .",
    "the panel arrangement in this figure corresponds to that in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , with however a lower bound of @xmath122 in the mismatch parameter , in order to better display the more intricate ldos structure .",
    "the results shown are for the self consistent state reached by starting from each of the four symmetric junction configurations . for larger mismatch , which corresponds to the back portion of the plots , all results are therefore similar , as the ldos reflects the independent nature of the isolated slabs ( the phase is irrelevant in this limit ) . for small mismatch (",
    "the ranges are indicated in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the results of panel ( a ) coincide with those of panel ( c ) and those of panel ( d ) with those of ( b ) , as can be seen by comparing the front portions of these panel pairs .",
    "the transitions can be noted in the plots .",
    "examination of the results shows clear differences between the four configurations . as in the three layer case , the peaks are more prominent at larger mismatch , and the `` gap '' is wider . at small mismatch , where only two configurations are stable ,",
    "the gaps fill up and the peaks become very small for both cases , namely @xmath88 ( panel ( b ) or large @xmath67 region of panel ( d ) ) , and @xmath100 ( panel ( c ) or front region of panel ( a ) ) .",
    "a similar situation occurs as a function of the barrier parameter @xmath66 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , which corresponds to the same conditions as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , with the same conventions and panel arrangements . in this case , however , the bcs peaks are ( at larger barrier heights ) more prominent for the @xmath88 and @xmath100 configurations since the @xmath1 layers are not yet completely decoupled at the largest @xmath66 shown , which ( again for clarity ) is smaller than that used in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the peaks weaken and the gap narrows and fills up at small barrier heights , as the proximity effect strengthens . the prominence or weakening of the peaks is associated@xcite with an increase or decrease of the condensation energy of the corresponding configuration , as one would intuitively expect . for small barrier heights we note also that the two states that exist in this case ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) have again clearly different signatures , as can be seen by comparing the front ( small @xmath66 ) portions of diagrams ( a ) and ( c ) with those of ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "a similar situation occurs at small mismatch ( larger @xmath67 ) , in fig .",
    "we have seen in this paper that the different junction configurations that compete in stability for different ranges of the relevant parameters , yield rather characteristic signatures in the local dos .",
    "thus , our results illustrate that the complex and nontrivial behavior of the pair amplitude in clean layered @xmath5 nanostructures is reflected in the ldos .",
    "the numerical method used here is based upon self consistent solution of the bdg equations .",
    "one advantage of this method is that it properly takes into account the atomic - scale and quantum interference effects that are likely to be important in these systems . for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures investigated here",
    ", one can have up to two and six independent locally stable configurations , respectively ; as the number of layers increases , so too does the number of possible configurations .",
    "quantitatively , we have shown that the larger the scattering strength at the interfaces , or the mismatch between fermi wavevectors of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 regions , the greater the number of stable states , since the proximity effects weaken .",
    "the various pair amplitude profiles however , exhibited distinct spatial forms in each case .",
    "we confirmed@xcite that it is essential to calculate the pair potential self consistently , since@xcite as the results shown here demonstrate , multilayer configurations can transition from one state to another abruptly , as one varies any one of the physical parameters : the magnetic exchange energy @xmath36 , interface scattering strength @xmath66 , and the fermi wavevector mismatch @xmath67 .",
    "the diverse behavior observed in the pair amplitude is found to be reflected in the calculated energy spectra .",
    "when several self - consistent pair amplitude configurations coexist , each representing a local or global minimum of the free energy , they yield specific signatures in the local dos , which are susceptible to measurement in local tunneling spectroscopy experiments . for a trilayer @xmath2 junction , variations in the exchange field parameter @xmath36 lead to oscillations in the number of subgap states , and there are similar changes in the seven layer spectrum .",
    "we also investigated the ldos profiles by separately varying @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the limiting cases of large @xmath66 or small @xmath67",
    "the ldos takes its typical bcs - like form , with few subgap quasiparticle states .",
    "the ldos in general however , has characteristic peaks and dips that depend on the symmetry of the ground state , and on @xmath66 , @xmath36 or @xmath67 .",
    "it would be of obvious interest to examine whether or not the configuration changes that occur as the material parameters are varied can happen also as a function of temperature .",
    "this question is now under investigation .",
