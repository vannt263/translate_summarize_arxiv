    "the _ debris disk radiative transfer simulation tool _ ( dds ) was developed with the aim to provide a flexible tool for the simulation of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of circumstellar debris disks .",
    "debris disks are solar system - sized dust disks with micron - sized grains produced as by - products of collisions between asteroid - like bodies being left over from the planet formation process . in the case of our solar system",
    ", the debris of jupiter - family short - period comets and colliding asteroids represents the dominant sources of zodiacal dust located between mars and jupiter .",
    "a second belt of dust is located beyond the orbit of neptune ( see , e.g. , dermott et al .  1992 , liou , dermott , & xu  1995 ) . besides the solar system , optical to mid - infrared images of @xmath3  pic ( see , e.g. , kalas & jewitt  1995 ; weinberger , becklin , & zuckerman  2003 ) and submillimeter images of vega , fomalhaut , and @xmath4  eri ( holland et al .",
    "1998 ; greaves et al .",
    "1998 ) have revealed spatially resolved debris disks which were first inferred from observations of infrared flux excesses above photospheric values with iras .",
    "the mass of small grains in debris disks and therefore the thermal dust reemission from these disks is expected to be much smaller than in the case of ttauri disks .",
    "for this reason , only a very limited sample of observations exists so far .",
    "however , because of the high sensitivity of the mid - infrared detectors aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ followed by the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ ( _ sofia _ ) , a substantial increase in the total number and in the specific information about debris disks is expected ( c.f . meyer  2002 ) .",
    "the range of applications of the dds , however , extends far beyond debris disks ( or similar , e.g. disk - like structures ) allowing to derive the reemission and scattered light sed for _ any _ three - dimensional optically thin dust distribution : in the optically thin limit only the radial distance @xmath5 between each individual grain of a dust distribution determines this grain s contribution to the net sed .",
    "thus , any arbitrarily shaped configuration described , e.g. by a three - dimensional denisty distribution @xmath6 can be reduced to an equivalent one - dimensional distribution @xmath7 in respect of its resulting thermal reemission and scattered light sed ( @xmath5 is the radial distance from the central star / heating source ) .",
    "the dds is therefore best characterized as a _",
    "tool for the simulation of scattered light and thermal reemission in arbitrary optically thin dust distributions with spherical , homogeneous grains where the dust parameters ( optical properties , sublimation temperature , grain size ) and sed of the illuminating / heating radiative source can be arbitrarily defined_.",
    "the solution of the radiative transfer problem implemented in the dds is based on three assumptions :    1 .",
    "the dust configuration is optically thin along any line of sight for both the stellar as well as for the reemission radiation from the dust , 2 .",
    "the dust grains are compact spheres with a homogeneous chemical structure , and 3 .",
    "the dust grains are large enough to be in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field .    in the optically thin limit ,",
    "each dust grain is heated by direct stellar radiation only .",
    "thus , the dust grain temperature is a function of the optical parameters of the grains , the incident stellar radiation , and the distance @xmath5 from the star . in this case",
    "the radiative transfer equation has a simple solution which allows one to derive the distance from the star at which the dust has a certain temperature .",
    "let @xmath8 be the monochromatic luminosity of the star ( radius @xmath9 , effective temperature @xmath10 ) at wavelength @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 be the absorbed and reemitted luminosity of a dust grain with radius @xmath14 and resulting temperature @xmath15 at the ( unknown ) radial distance @xmath5 from the star .",
    "using the constraint of energy conservation @xmath16 one derives the distance of the grain from the star as @xmath17 if the dust sublimation temperature is known , eq .",
    "[ eq_dist5 ] also allows one to estimate the sublimation radius @xmath18 for each dust component in the shell ( characterized by the grain radius and chemical composition ) .",
    "the flux of the light scattered by a single dust grain amounts to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dust grain s albedo .",
    "the net spectral energy distribution results from a simple summation of the reemitted and scattered light contributions from all grains .",
    "the interaction of the stellar radiation field with the dust grains - characterized by the efficiency factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( and thus the albedo @xmath20 ) - is described by mie scattering theory in the dds .",
    "the mie scattering function is calculated using the numerical solution for the estimation of the mie scattering coefficients published by wolf & voshchinnikov ( 2004 ; see also voshchinnikov  2004 ) , which achieves accurate results both in the small as well as in the   arbitrarily   large size parameter regime .",
    "in this section the general scheme and main features of the dds are described . for this reason a simplified chart symbolizing the data flow is given in fig .",

    "the reason for this behaviour is that the dust grain parameters ( efficiency factors , albedo - see sect .",

    "the distance between two subsequent radial points should decrease towards the heating source in order to allow the code ( otc ) to resolve the increasing radial temperature gradient .",
    "the step size between two subsequent radial points has to be chosen smaller than the typical size of structures in the density distribution in a particular distance @xmath5 from the star in order to prevent skipping of local density enhancements , etc .",
    "( for the simulation of the spectral energy distribution a linear increase / decrease of the density between two subsequent radial points is assumed ) .",
    "further remarks :    * the quantity @xmath31 represents the _ relative _ number of grains .",
    "the absolute number of grains is estimated internally based on the total mass of the dust configuration , specific dust density and grain size distribution . *",
    "a radial grid with a logarithmic equidistant distribution of grid points is a good choice in the case of `` smooth '' density distribution decreasing towards the radiative source . in the case of a clumpy structure",
