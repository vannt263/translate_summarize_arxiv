    "current theories of particle physics predict that topological defects would almost certainly be formed during the early evolution of the universe [ 1 ] .",
    "just as liquids turn to solids when the temperature drops , so the interactions between elementary particles run through distinct phases as the typical energy of those particles decreases with the expansion of the universe .",
    "when conditions favor the appearance of a new phase , the new phase crops up in many places at the same time , and when separate regions of the new phase run into each other , topological defects are the result .",
    "the detection of defects in the modern universe would provide precious information on events in the earliest moments after the big bang .",
    "their absence , on the other hand , would force a major revision of current physics theories .",
    "the least of which would be to have the phase transitions be second or higher order .",
    "the potential role of cosmic topological defects in the evolution of our universe has interested the astrophysical community for many years . combined theoretical and experimental work",
    "has led to the development of observational signatures in a variety of diverse data sets . these have , on one hand removed one major motivation of the primary role in structure formation and on the other raised new motivations .",
    "these have also narrowed the range of allowable topological defects so that most viable models are likely to produce some variety of cosmic strings .",
    "cmb anisotropy power spectrum observations rule out topological defects as the primary source of structure in the universe [ 2,3 ] .",
    "observations strongly favor adiabatic random fluctuations from something like inflation rather than the structure formation from topological defects ( e.g. cosmic strings ) .",
    "these cmb results , while confirming inflation , do not rule out lower level contributions from topological defects .",
    "interest in cosmic strings has , in fact , been renewed with recent theoretical work on hybrid inflation , d - brane inflation and susy guts .",
    "the idea that inflationary cosmology might lead to cosmic string production is not new ; however , it has received new impetus from the brane world scenario suggested by superstring theory .",
    "a seemingly unavoidable outcome of brane inflation is the production of a network of cosmic strings [ 4 ] , whose effects on cosmological observables range from negligible to substantial , depend on the specific brane inflationary scenario [ 5 ] . a number of theory papers [ 12,13,14 ] , anticipating that searches from cosmic strings will be negative and set significant limits , have begun developing modified theories so as not to produce them . at minimum these modified models must introduce a new field ( also warping brane ) .    since a moving string would produce a steplike discontinuity in the cmb , it will cause temperature distribution deviate from gaussian .",
    "we may be able to detect non - gaussian aspects of temperature distribution provided sufficient resolution .",
    "we search for strings in two ways : statistical and pattern - discovery methods .",
    "statistical analysis determines how much the distribution of temperature fluctuation deviates from gaussian distribution or what fraction of the fluctuations might be due to strings . in the second approach , we can search for cosmic strings directly from temperature map by their distinctive pattern of anisotropy .",
    "the latter approach is much easier and more straight forward when cmb signal is not contaminated seriously .",
    "these methods are distinctly different than a simple fitting to angular power spectrum [ 4 ] .",

    ".      the signal in a microwave sky map will be made of several components : noise from the instrument , foreground signals ( expected to be small away from the galactic plane and with strong sources punched out ) , cmb fluctuations from adiabatic ( or appropriate ) fluctuations , and potential signals from the strings.the signal observed at any pixel is then @xmath48 since the nature of signal is the superposition of random gaussian signal ( noise , @xmath49 ) and non - gaussian contribution ( @xmath50 ) , there are two basic forms of distribution functions ( foreground will be removed from the beginning ) .    here and later on in this paper , we use two identical variables @xmath6 and @xmath51 confusingly , i.e , @xmath52 .",
