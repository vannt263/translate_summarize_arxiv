    "core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are the explosive events that mark the death of massive stars ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "they are classified into hydrogen - rich events , type iip / l / n / b , and hydrogen - deficient events , type ib / c , according to the presence or absence of hydrogen lines in their spectrum .",
    "this is directly related to the composition of the outer layers of a progenitor star at the moment of explosion .",
    "type ii supernova ( sn ) progenitors have kept their hydrogen rich outer envelope intact , while type ib / c have lost the hydrogen envelope .",
    "the most direct evidence linking the star that explodes to the type of sn is from direct detection of the progenitor in pre - explosion images .",
    "non - detections of progenitors in pre - explosion images for type ibc sn were used by @xcite to indicate the important effect of interacting binary stars on determining the ccsn progenitor diversities and local ccsn rate .",
    "this idea was later reinforced by the probable detection of a binary system progenitor for the type ibc sn iptf13bvn @xcite .",
    "+   + however , it is difficult to directly detect ccsn progenitors because the event must occur in a galaxy within about 30 mpc that has been imaged by the hubble space telescope before explosion .",
    "therefore indirect methods must be exploited to gain further insight into ccsne .",
    "the most useful methods include the relative rates of different ccsn types , the stellar populations surrounding the site of ccsne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the location of ccsne within their host galaxies .",
    "+   + one other interesting constraint on ccsne and their progenitors can be obtained by exploiting the link between stellar deaths and stellar births .",
    "this was attempted by .",
    "they used the 11hugs galaxy catalogue that lists the @xmath0 and fuv fluxes for a large number of galaxies within 11 mpc .",
    "these fluxes are commonly used tracers of recent star formation .",
    "the amount of @xmath0 and fuv emitted are determined by the most massive hot stars that evolve quickly and explode as ccsne a few million years after their formation .",
    "were able to show that the observed @xmath0 and fuv fluxes from the 11hugs galaxies were consistent with the observed ccsn rate for the galaxies if the minimum stellar mass for a ccsn to occur was @xmath3 , in agreement with results from ccsn progenitor detection in @xcite .",
    "+   + this study was repeated by @xcite who tried a slightly more sophisticated modelling of the 11hugs galaxies . rather than using the canonical expected sfr conversion factors from they estimated the expected @xmath0 , fuv flux and ccsn rate from the latest stellar models including rotation calculated by . over the last few decades",
    "the understanding of how rotation affects stellar evolution has significantly advanced .",
    "the general effect is to increase the main - sequence life time and temperature of massive stars as they evolve so lead to more @xmath0 and fuv flux being emitted for the same sfr .",
    "@xcite found that it is possible that there could be a ccsn rate excess as well as that the observations disfavoured the rotating models as they made this sn rate excess worse .",
    "+   + there is a second important factor left for our stellar population models that is the effect of interacting binaries .",
    "when two stars are orbiting each other in a binary - star system the opportunity for mass transfer between the two stars arises .",
    "the more massive star typically evolves faster than the less massive star , fills its roche - lobe and transfers mass to the companion star .",
    "this produces more hot and luminous stars and therefore has similar observed consequence as stellar rotation does .",
    "however the situation may be more complex as there is evidence that the most rapid rotation only occurs in binary systems @xcite .",
    "+   + in this paper we continue the work of and @xcite by attempting to match the observed @xmath0 , fuv fluxes and ccsn rate in the 11hugs galaxies .",
    "we will use the binary population and spectral synthesis ( bpass , http://bpass.auckland.ac.nz ) code that accounts for the impact of interacting binaries on stellar populations ( eldridge & stanway 2009 , 2012 ) . the bpass code has been tested against a number of different observables that are dependant on the evolution of massive stars . our aim is to apply a simple test to bpass models to reproducing the ccsn rate , @xmath0 and fuv fluxes .",
    "our work concentrates on the effect of interacting binary stars on the ccsn rate of their host galaxies .",
    "we also include two other refinements to our models .",
    "first we reproduce the chemical compositions of the 11hugs galaxies based on the b - band magnitude of nearby galaxies sample rather than using a solar composition population .",
    "second we allow the sfh to vary rather than assuming only a constant sfr . +   + the structure of this paper",
    "is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the 11hugs and ccsn samples and how we determine the metallicity of the 11hugs galaxies . in the following section 3 ,",
    "we summarise the effect of interacting binary stars on ccsn rate and sfris we find from the bpass code s results .",
    "we also outline how we use these bpass results to construct our synthetic galaxy models . in section 4 ,",
    "we compare our models to observations before finally discussing our results and presenting our conclusions in section 5 .",
    ".nearby galaxy sample from the 11 hugs survey and ccsne sample from @xcite : numbers of galaxies , the total @xmath4 , @xmath5 and ccsn rate ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath7the @xmath8 for sample a is an estimation with respect to the relative ratio of @xmath0 and uv flux from sample b and c. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sne rate ratio ]    our constant sfh model is the simplest case to consider .",
    "we show how the @xmath0 and fuv fluxes vary relative to the ccsn rate in figure [ fig : fluxsne_mixmetallicity ] .",
    "the values expected for the 11hugs galaxies are shown by the boxes indicating the range of values allowed for the observed fluxes and ccsn rates .",
    "we find both single - star and binary - star models perform reasonably well with predictions within a factor of 2 to the observed values .",
    "also the agreement is closer for the fuv flux rather than the @xmath0 flux .",
    "however the models tend to overestimate the amount of @xmath0 and fuv fluxes required to reproduce the observed ccsn rate , showing there is a possible excess of ccsne as found by several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also find that the standard single - star population achieves the closest fit to the observed parameters .",
    "our binary - star models produce much greater @xmath0 flux than the single - star population which causes tension with the observations .",
    "however there are limitations to our models which currently do not yet account for the effects of dust on the @xmath0 and fuv emission .",
    "+   + on the other hand there is another test we can apply as shown in table [ tab : sne rate ratio ] .",
    "the ratio of the rate of type ibc sne to the rate of type ii sne is @xmath9 .",
    "the large error is due to the small number of events .",
    "this ratio is strongly dependent on age , interacting binary fraction and metallicity .",
    "the effect of the latter is shown in table [ tab : sne rate ratio ] .",
    "the predicted ccsn rate ratios for our single - star and binary - star models are either side of the observed value .",
    "the single - star prediction is lower than the observed value but within the range allowed by errors .",
    "by contrast , the ratio from binary stars is higher than the observed value . however a mix of single - star and binary - star population also gives a good fit to the observed value .       and uv flux as a function of timescale parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the shaded regions show the range of @xmath0 and fuv flux when the predicted ccsn rate matches the observed rate of the 11hugs galaxies in table [ tab : local galaxies ] .",
    "the pairs of black straight lines show the observed value range of @xmath0 and uv flux in sample ab and c as shown in table [ tab : local galaxies ] .",
    "because the fuv flux of sample a is arichived from our estimation , we mark it by two dashed black lines . ]    with constant sfh we predict too much @xmath0 and fuv flux relative to the ccsn rate .",
    "we therefore decided to investigate alternative sfhs in order to reduce the contribution of young stars .",
    "a delayed sfh is applied as described in section 3 .",
    "the outcomes we achieve under the delayed star birth assumption are shown in figure [ fig : flux_tau_mixz ] . here",
    "the shaded regions show the range of @xmath0 and fuv fluxes from our synthetic galaxies in which the predicted ccsn rate matches the observed rate of the 11hugs galaxies.we see that for matching the @xmath0 flux and the ccsn rate at the same time the preferred values for @xmath11 are between 6.3 to 6.7 , or times of 2 to 5 myrs .",
    "although the binary - star models are only just below the observed values and so longer values of @xmath12 would not be unreasonable . while to match the fuv flux and ccsn rate a much wider range of possible values for @xmath11 are possible between 6.3 to 7.4 , or times of 2 to 25 myrs .",
    "this implies that fuv flux follows on a much longer timescale than the @xmath0 flux as expected .",
    "+   + figure [ fig : mixz ] illustrates how the relative ratio of the two ccsn type rates , @xmath13 , varies with @xmath12 .",
    "this plot is similar to figure [ fig : flux_tau_mixz ] showing that as @xmath12 increases the binary - star models are favoured relative to the single - star models where the ratio drops for the single stars .",
    "the key difference between the single - star and binary - star models is that the single - star population can only reproduce the observation for @xmath12 in a short period of approximately 2 myrs . while the binary population , or a mix of single stars and binaries could reproduce the 11hugs observations over a much longer time scale .",
    "however the delayed sfh models are in effect just a starburst model where the age of the burst is linked to its duration .",
    "so the best fit we can rule out is that the sfh that best matches the 11hugs galaxies is one that is not dominated by a recent young burst but older more mature bursts .",
    "+   + in summary , our delayed sfh models show a preference for 3 myrs in matching with observed values .",
    "this fact could be due to a sample selection effect but this is remote as 11hugs are a distance limited sample not @xmath0 selected .",
    "it is more likely that we are over predicting the @xmath0 emission over the first 3 myrs of the star formation .    ) as a function of timescale paparamter @xmath10 .",
    "the red dotted line is from sinlge - star model and blue dotted line is from binary - star model .",
    "a mixed population of single - star and binary - star model is shown in the yellow dotted line .",
    "the green horizontal lines show the observed ccsn ratio range ( @xmath14 ) as shown in table [ tab : sne rate ratio ] .",
    ", width=321 ]",
    "we have created a synthetic model of the 11hugs galaxies to investigate the effect of interacting binary stars .",
    "we find binaries do not vary the overall ccsn rate to any great degree but do boost the number of type ibc sne and the @xmath0 and fuv sfris linked to hottest stars . +   + in trying to match the observations of the 11hugs galaxies we must discuss the caveats within our population models .",
    "we have not yet accounted for the absorption of the ionizing photons by dust grains and therefore these photons do not form @xmath0 flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is not yet included in our models .",
    "in addition , the 11hugs samples are only nearly complete . as in sample",
    "a there is more star formation occurring than in sample b , the expected sample a fuv flux might be greater than we predict here",
    ". this result would then be in closer agreement with the binary - star population under constant sfh model",
    ". therefore we should not be too surprised that the match is not perfect but there is more work to refine the synthetic galaxy population .",
    "+   + the most surprising fact however is that our constant sfh models produce too many ccsne in the nearest 11 mpc of space as argued in @xcite .",
    "this implies that all supernovae predicted by the models have to be observed .",
    "if some massive stars form black holes at core collapse and are unobservable event as suggested by @xcite then this excess of stellar deaths compared to stellar population models becomes more severe .",
    "however estimating whether a specific stellar model would produce an observable sn or not requires detailed modelling of the core - collapse and the subsequent explosion .",
    "+   + on the other hand , the delayed sfh model argues that the predicted ccsn rate from @xmath0 and fuv sfris is dependent on the assumption of the sfh .",
    "one interpretation of our preferred delayed sfh model is that it implies we over estimate the flux from young stars and therefore get an excess of ccsne .",
    "a similar result is also provided by ionizing photon leakage and dust attenuation on @xmath0 and fuv flux . therefore to truly determine if the sfris and ccsn rate match , the ionized photon leakage and dust attenuation must be considered .",
    "however this is not straightforward .",
    "+   + we have also investigated how sensitive our results are to the metallicity calibration we use for modelling the metallicities of the 11hugs galaxies .",
    "we find that having the more metal rich biased population leads to small changes in the @xmath0 and fuv fluxes",
    ". with a more metal poor distribution we would find even more @xmath0 and fuv fluxes and would result in greater disagreement between the observations and our models .",
    "therefore the mismatch between our constant star - formation models and observations is difficult to explain by an incorrect metallicity distribution .",
    "+   + our main conclusion is that single - star models matches the observations best in terms of the prediction of total ccsn rate , when the effects of ionizing photon leakage and dust attenuation are not considered and assuming the local star formation has followed a constant sfh over the last few 100 myrs .",
    "binary - star models however prolong the stellar age of stars to go ccsn and therefore provide a better prediction of ccsn rate under various sfh spanning star - burst duration between 3 and 25 myrs ago .",
    "in addition , single - star models under constant sfh predicted a lower ratio of type ibc relative to type ii sn but still within the observed uncertainty .",
    "by contrast , binary - star models overestimate the ratio .",
    "however , a mix of single - star and binary - star model also gives a good fit as in .",
    "the limitation in making a firm determination is due to the large uncertainty caused by limited numbers of ccsn discovered . with more ccsn discovered within 11 mpc this uncertainty will decrease .",
    "if the number of ccsn is doubled we estimate that it may become possible to rule out the single - star only population .",
    "one final argument against the single - star model is that under the delayed sfh the single - star model only match the observations for a burst of star formation only 2 myrs old .",
    "however mixing in binaries to the single - star population provides a better fit with weaker constraints on the age of the population .",
    "+   + finally we note that our results are robust if the ccsn sample is complete .",
    "however we already obtain too many ccsne compared to its associated @xmath0 and fuv .",
    "if there are missing sne or other massive stellar deaths in our sample that are not included in our ccsn sample then the disagreement between models and observations becomes worse with too many stars dying compared to the number we observe forming .",
