    "<S> we study rogue wave excitation pattern in a two - component bose - einstein condensate with pair - transition effects . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that rogue wave excitation can exist on a stripe phase background for which there are cosine and sine wave background in the two components respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the rogue wave peak can be much lower than the ones of scalar matter wave rogue waves , and varies with the wave period changing . </S>",
    "<S> both rogue wave pattern and rogue wave number on temporal - spatial plane are much more abundant than the ones reported before . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we prove that the rogue wave number can be @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 are arbitrary non - negative integers ) , in contrast to @xmath2 for scalar nonlinear schrdinger equation described systems . </S>",
    "<S> these results would enrich our knowledge on nonlinear excitations in multi - component bose - einstein condensate with transition coupling effects . </S>"
