    "this nonlinear constraint enforces the thermodynamics of the model on an @xmath14 dimensional hypersphere and induces the interactions between the fields .",

    "therein :    \\(i ) the coupling constant @xmath5 is dimensionless and the the theory is renormalizable .",
    "it turns out that it has a negative @xmath15 function , thus showing asymptotic freedom .",
    "\\(ii ) the model is conformal invariant at the classical level , but , just as yang - mills theories in four dimensions , at the quantum level an energy scale emerges due to quantum corrections and a non - perturbative mass - gap emerges ( trace anomaly ) @xcite : although the lagrangian @xmath7 in eq .",

    "\\(iii ) for @xmath19 the model has instantons and , at finite temperature , calorons @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to study in a simplified framework what is the role of these nonperturbative field configurations in thermodynamics ( for the related case in ym theories see for instance refs .",

    "the aim of this work is to present an analytical study of the nonlinear @xmath0 model in @xmath1 dimensions at nonzero temperature .",
    "we compute the pressure by employing the cjt formalism @xcite and using the auxiliary field method in the one - loop approximation ( for other thermodynamical quantities and the two - loop calculation and technical details see ref .",

    "therefore , contrary to the four - dimensional case @xcite , case ( ii ) is the right choice .",
    "this means that in two dimensions there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global @xmath0 symmetry of the nonlinear @xmath0 model .",
    "this reflects the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem , see ref .",

    "( [ z ] ) eliminates one degree of freedom .",
    "one can go beyond the one - loop results and study the pressure at the two - loop level using the formalism developed in @xcite , see also ref .",

    "indeed , it is possible to show analytically that for large @xmath3 the two - loop pressure approaches the correct value @xmath74 .",
    "in this work we have studied the @xmath0 model in 1 + 1 dimensions at nonzero @xmath75 we have described how a mass gap is generated for @xmath60 , thus demonstrating the occurrence of dimensional transmutation .",
    "we have then shown explicitly the analytic results for the pressure at the one - loop level and briefly commented on the results at the two - loop level .",
    "finally , these analytic expressions for the pressure have been compared with lattice results , see fig .",

    "more advanced analytical calculations can be performed in the future and compared to lattice data : in fact , this system represents a good tool to test nonperturbative approaches , which can then be applied to the more difficult case of yang - mills theories in four dimensions .",
