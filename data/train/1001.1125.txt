    "two purely electric mechanisms have been proposed to generate spin accumulations in electronic systems with spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "they are current - induced spin polarization  @xcite and the spin hall effect  @xcite .",
    "both phenomena appear when a spin - orbit coupled conductor is traversed by an electric current .",
    "current - induced spin polarization manifests itself in a weak bulk polarization of the electronic spins in a direction determined by the electric current and the soi , while the spin hall effect manifests itself in a spin accumulation at the lateral edges of the sample .",
    "though the resulting polarizations are usually rather weak , both effects have been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "they offer an elegant alternative to spin injection and manipulation with ferromagnets , zeeman fields or by optical means , and pave the way toward spintronic devices with purely electric control of electronic spins .",
    "a dual aspect of these magnetoelectric effects is that they are accompanied by spin currents , flowing either inside the sample or leaving it .",
    "early analytical investigations of these spin currents have been devoted to calculations of bulk spin conductivities , but it was soon realized that the latter are not always related to physically relevant quantities .",
    "local approaches based on classical kinetic equations have been used to investigate the conversion of magnetoelectric spin accumulations at the edge of a spin - orbit coupled sample into spin currents leaving the sample  @xcite .",
    "these quasiclassical theories have been quite successful , however they neglect coherent effects and , in their present form , are not appropriate to investigate local fluctuations and spatial correlations of spin polarization .",
    "coherent mesoscopic effects on spin currents have recently attracted quite some theoretical attention , both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite , in both diffusive and ballistic systems , while so far only mesoscopic fluctuations of sample - integrated spin polarizations in the diffusive regime have been investigated  @xcite . at present ,",
    "little is known about local coherent fluctuations of spin polarizations , the scale on which they occur , how they are correlated , and how they influence spin currents and their fluctuations , neither have current - induced spin polarizations in chaotic ballistic systems been investigated so far .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to start filling these gaps , by investigating the magnetoelectric generation of spin polarizations in ballistic mesoscopic samples .    to that end",
    "we construct a _ spin - probe model _ , which connects local spin - dependent chemical potentials to those imposed on a nearby probe . in this way",
    ", we are able to express local current - induced spin polarizations in terms of transmission coefficients deriving from the scattering matrix . focusing on chaotic ballistic mesoscopic systems ,",
    "we then use random matrix theory  @xcite to calculate the statistics of these polarizations .",
    "we find that , while the ensemble average polarization vanishes , it fluctuates from position to position ( in a given sample ) and from sample to sample .",
    "for sufficiently large systems , the amplitude of these fluctuations by far exceeds the magnitude of all current - induced polarizations investigated to date .",
    "simultaneously , we show that this polarization is mostly uncorrelated with spin currents in external leads and thus can not easily be converted into a large spin current , at least not in linear response .     the spin - probe set - up . an open quantum dot with spin - orbit interaction",
    "is traversed by an electric current ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the magnetoelectrically generated spin accumulation is measured locally by an external probe ( @xmath1 ) where spin - orbit interaction is absent . the charge and spin - resolved electrochemical potentials of the probe",
    "are set such that no spin nor charge current flow between the dot and the probe . when the probe is contacted to the system via a tunnel barrier of low transparency",
    ", we argue that the spin - dependent potentials in the probe can be identified with the local spin - resolved potentials in the sample at the contact with the probe .",
    "this allows to relate spin accumulations to spin - dependent transmission coefficients . ]",
    "[ fig : probe_sketch ] gives a sketch of the system we focus on .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional chaotic ballistic quantum dot connected via reflectionless transport terminals to two external electron reservoirs .",
    "the reservoirs are biased and an electric current flows through the dot . assuming that soi is strong enough that the spin - orbit time is shorter than the mean electronic dwell time in the dot , @xmath2 , spin rotational symmetry is totally broken inside the dot .",
    "together with chaotic boundary scattering , this leads to spin relaxation .",
    "does the current flowing through this soi coupled , spin - relaxing system generate a spin polarization ?",
    "on one hand , the relative positions of the contacts to the external electrodes determine an average electronic drift . in that sense",
    ", the situation is very similar to that considered by edelstein  @xcite , and one would accordingly argue that a current - induced spin polarization should emerge . on the other hand ,",
    "however , electronic distribution functions are not well defined locally in such a system where momentum and energy relax on the scale of the system itself .",
    "one might thus wonder how local spin - dependent potentials can be consistently defined .    here",
    ", we circumvent this difficulty by introducing an additional mobile terminal whose purpose it is to probe the local chemical potentials on the dot .",
    "we assume that spin currents are well defined in the probe as well as in the transport terminals , which presupposes that spin relaxation processes are frozen there .",
    "in particular , soi is present only in the dot .",
    "the probe is assumed to carry a single - transport channel .",
    "it is connected at one end to a macroscopic external reservoir , which defines its electrochemical and spin - dependent chemical potentials unambiguously , while its other end is contacted to the quantum dot via a tunnel barrier of transparency @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath4 , the probe does not perturb the dot and we can identify the spin - dependent chemical potentials on the dot with the corresponding probe potentials defined by the condition that neither charge nor spin currents flow between the probe and the dot  @xcite .",
    "the probe being mobile , it can scan the whole dot area , and being single - channeled , it has maximal resolution .",
    "it can thus map the spin - polarization in the dot with maximal accuracy .",
    "the _ spin - probe model _ becomes a powerful theoretical tool to calculate spin accumulations once electric and spin currents in the probe and the two transport terminals are related to chemical potentials via the scattering approach to transport  @xcite .",
    "when the probe carries a single transport channel , time - reversal symmetry and the unitarity of the scattering matrix ensure that the reflection coefficients from the probe back to itself are diagonal in spin indices , independently of @xmath5 .",
    "this allows to directly express the electrochemical and spin - dependent chemical potentials of the probe in terms of spin - dependent transmission coefficients from the transport leads to the probe , and the chemical potentials at those leads .",
    "this is done below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : accu ] ) .",
    "we additionally find that , for a single - channel probe , the dependence that transmission coefficients have on @xmath5 factorizes .",
    "this has the important , and somewhat surprising consequence that the chemical potentials ensuring the vanishing of the currents through the probe , being given by the ratio of transmission coefficients , do not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "this is an exact result , valid as long as one has a single - channel probe , and we stress that it is true not only on average nor to some leading order .",
    "consequently , we are able to obtain the value of the spin - dependent potentials on the probe in the limit @xmath6 , where it is justified to identify the potentials on the dot with those on the probe , while performing the calculation for the analytically simpler case @xmath7 .    our scattering theory of spin accumulations can be applied to both diffusive and ballistic mesoscopic systems in the linear response regime .",
    "because current - induced spin polarization has not been considered in these systems so far , we specialize here to ballistic systems , and accordingly apply random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite to calculate average and fluctuations of the spin - resolved local chemical potentials .",
    "we perform our calculation for @xmath7 to avoid unnecessary complications arising from the presence of a poisson kernel for @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "we find that , within rmt , there is no current - induced local spin polarization on mesoscopic average .",
    "however , sample - dependent or probe position - dependent fluctuations make local spin - dependent chemical potentials fluctuate with a variance @xmath9 given by the voltage bias @xmath10 between the two transport leads and the number @xmath11 of channels each of them carries .",
    "the above formula gives the leading order contribution in @xmath12 .",
    "the exact formula is given below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : var_mup ] ) . within rmt ,",
    "the variance is the same for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the transmission coefficients from the transport terminals to the probe are elements of a scattering matrix which depends on the position of the probe .",
    "therefore , as the probe scans the sample , these coefficients fluctuate .",
    "below , we conjecture and numerically confirm that , within rmt , moving a single - channel terminal by a single fermi wavelength is sufficient to decorrelate transmission coefficients to and from that terminal .",
    "this has for consequence that the total polarization integrated over the entire dot , while still averaging to zero , acquires a sample - to - sample variance given by the single - channel local variance multiplied by the total number @xmath15 of uncorrelated probe positions .",
    "thus , @xmath16 because @xmath17 gives the chemical potential difference between the two possible spin orientation along the spin axis @xmath18 , dividing it by twice the level spacing converts it into a number of polarized spins in that direction .",
    "this gives the typical number of polarized spins in a given sample as @xmath19 with the dot level spacing @xmath20 , the width @xmath21 of the transport terminals and the linear dot size @xmath22 .",
    "( [ eq : typaccu ] ) is one of our main results .",
    "it predicts that linear electric transport across a typical , ballistic mesoscopic quantum dot generates a giant polarization of the electronic spins inside the dot in the semiclassical limit @xmath23 , and for a large enough dwell time @xmath24 .",
    "this typical polarization is in particular much larger than the average magnetoelectric polarization predicted by edelstein  @xcite @xmath25 in a diffusive dot with elastic mean free path @xmath26 and with rashba soi whose strength @xmath27 is usually only a fraction of @xmath28 .",
    "it is also much larger than the typical duckheim - loss polarization  @xcite , @xmath29 predicted for @xmath30 . despite its magnitude , @xmath31 can not easily be converted into a large spin current . below we demonstrate this by calculating the correlator of the spin polarization with the spin current in external leads , and show that this correlator vanishes unless the probe is within a fermi wavelength of the contact to the terminal .",
    "in other words , rmt predicts that only accumulations right at the boundary of the sample can be extracted and converted into spin currents in the linear regime , which is consistant with the universal fluctuations of spin currents found in refs .",
    "it is at present unclear if more spin current can be extracted in nonlinear regimes of transport .",
    "having summarized our method and main findings , we now proceed to present our theory more formally . in the next section  [ section : scatt ]",
    ", we construct a scattering theory of current - induced spin polarization . in section  [ section :",
    "rmt ] , we focus on ballistic systems and apply rmt to calculate the mean and variance of the local as well as of the sample - integrated polarizations .",

    "<S> the statistics of these local chemical potentials is calculated within random matrix theory . while they vanish on spatial and mesoscopic average , they exhibit large fluctuations , and we show that single systems typically have spin polarizations exceeding all known current - induced spin polarizations by a parametrically large factor . </S>",

    "<S> we show that these large polarizations correlate only weakly with spin currents in external leads , and that only a fraction of them can be converted into a spin current in the linear regime of transport , which is consistent with the mesoscopic universality of spin conductance fluctuations . </S>",
