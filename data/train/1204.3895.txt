    "supersymmetric gauge theories in 3 dimensions have been studied extensively in recent years with various motivations .",
    "many 3d theories are related to others by dualities which include strong - coupling physics .",
    "various quantities were studied to have a detailed understanding of these strongly coupled theories , often relying on supersymmetry and localization methods .",
    "especially , the superconformal index @xcite and the partition function on the 3-sphere @xcite found a wide range of applications .",
    "although these quantities were originally calculated for supersymmetric chern - simons - matter theories @xcite , they are applicable to a broader class of 3d theories .",
    "these partition functions were generalized and studied in various extended frameworks @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study another quantity which contains interesting information on the non - perturbative physics of 3d gauge theories .",
    "3d gauge theories , including cft s with relevant deformations , in their higgs phases can have vortex solitons in their spectra .",
    "in supersymmetric gauge theories , bps vortices often play important roles in the dynamics of these theories @xcite .",
    "we calculate and study an index which counts these bps vortex particles .",
    "the vortices we study are called topological vortices . in some theories , there are also non - topological vortices in partially unbroken phases , which we only discuss briefly .",
    "we use this partition function to investigate strong - coupling dualities in 3 dimensions .",
    "the vortex partition function ( or the index ) has been studied to certain extent in the literature , and especially the partition function of 2 dimensional vortices as instantons was investigated in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a very recent work .",
    "the partition function of 3d theories compactified on a circle was discussed as well . as instantons in euclidean qft",
    "can be regarded as solitonic particles in one higher dimension , the last vortex partition function has a natural interpretation as an index counting bps states .",
    "theory compactified on a circle .",
    "] however , see section 2.3 for a possible subtlety of the index interpretation for the so - called semi - local vortices , due to their noncompact internal moduli .",
    "from the recent finding that squashed 3-sphere partition functions admit factorizations to vortex partition functions @xcite in some theories , the latter may perhaps be a more basic quantity than other 3d partition functions @xcite known in the literature . also , the superconformal index which counts monopole operators is conceptually quite similar to the vortex partition functions , as monopole operators are creating / annihilating nonzero vortex charges .",
    "see also @xcite for comments on possible relations of these partition functions in simple models .    in this paper",
    ", we restrict our study to 3d @xmath2 and @xmath7 supersymmetric gauge theories with @xmath8 gauge group coupled to matter fields in fundamental representations .",
    "our partition function can be used to study various non - perturbative dualities of these theories .",
    "we study the 3d seiberg - like dualities similar to @xcite .",
    "seiberg duality is an ir duality , in which two different uv theories flow to the same ir fixed point .",
    "although it was originally found in 4d @xmath9 sqcd @xcite , such dualities were also discovered and studied in 3 dimensions .",
    "3d seiberg dualities were first discussed in @xcite .",
    "although they have some formal similarities to 4d seiberg dualities , physical implications of these dualities are not quite the same in different dimensions . 4d seiberg duality can be regarded as an electromagnetic duality and also as a weak - strong coupling duality @xcite .",
    "similar interpretation in 3d is lacking , at least when there are no chern - simons term so that we do not have ir couplings .",
    "seiberg duality also exists after introducing a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) deformation on both sides of the dual pair . denoting by @xmath10 the fi parameter",
    ", there exist bps vortex solitons whose masses are proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "considering the regime in which @xmath10 is much smaller than the yang - mills coupling scale @xmath11 , 3d seiberg duality should map different types of ` light ' vortex particles in the dual pair .",
    "we show that the spectra of the topological vortex particles as seen by our partition function perfectly agree between the seiberg - dual pairs , when they exhaust all possible vortices ( without non - topological vortices ) .",
    "this is the 3d version of the 4d seiberg duality map .",
    "while in the latter case glueballs , baryons and magnetic monopoles in the confining phase map to the elementary quarks in the dual higgs phase @xcite , in 3d we naturally find that vortices map to dual vortices .",
    "3d @xmath2 seiberg duality can be partly motivated by brane systems @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 that we consider in this paper can be engineered by the d - brane / ns5-brane system shown in fig [ n=4-brane ] . by changing the positions of the two ns5-branes , which makes them",
    "cross each other when @xmath12 , one obtains another 3d gauge theory with @xmath13 gauge group and @xmath14 flavors for @xmath15 .",
    "_ supposing that _ both theories flow to nontrivial ir fixed points , seiberg duality asserts that the two ir fixed points are the same .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , it turns out that one of the two uv theories in the putative dual pair often does not flow to an ir cft , at least not in the ` standard way ' @xcite in which the @xmath16 superconformal r - symmetry is the @xmath16 r - symmetry visible in uv .",
    "one way to see this is to study the r - charges of bps monopole operators , which we review in section 3 .",
    "firstly , when @xmath17 , there exist monopole operators whose r - charges are smaller than @xmath18 . if the theory flows to a cft , the bps bound demands that this r - charge be the scale dimension of the operator , violating the unitarity bound",
    "these theories were called ` bad ' @xcite . when @xmath19 , called ` ugly ' case , there exists a monopole operator with r - charge @xmath18 , saturating the unitarity bound in ir . in this case , the modified version of the naive seiberg duality is that the @xmath8 theory with @xmath19 flavors is dual to the @xmath20 theory with @xmath19 flavors times a decoupled free theory of a ( twisted ) hypermultiplet .",
    "this has been recently tested from the 3-sphere partition function @xcite . as the case with @xmath21 is trivially self seiberg - dual , the pair containing the case with @xmath19 was the only nontrivial dual pair @xcite .",
    "our vortex partition function confirms this duality at @xmath19 : namely , the partition function agrees with that of the @xmath22 theory with @xmath19 flavors times the vortex partition function of the @xmath23 theory ( the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortex ) .",
    "as the last vortices are free , it agrees with the above argument that the free hypermultiplet sector exists . also , the monopole operator mentioned in the previous paragraph with dimension @xmath18 is nothing but the vortex - creating operator , making it natural to identify the above free hypermultiplet as the vortex supermultiplet",
    ". the test can be made at each vortex number @xmath24 , which makes the confirmation highly nontrivial . moreover",
    ", our vortex partition function suggests that the general putative dual pair for any @xmath15 could be actually seiberg - dual to each other , also with a modification by adding a factorized sector .",
    "this may be suggesting a broader class of ir fixed points than those identified in @xcite .",
    "see section 3.1 for the details .",
    "seiberg dualities with @xmath25 supersymmetry were also studied quite extensively in recent years , after they were discovered in chern - simons - matter theories @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied various 3d seiberg dualities using the 3-sphere partition function and the superconformal index .",
    "other studies on the chern - simons seiberg dualities include @xcite .",
    "we study the vortex partition function of the above @xmath2 theory , deformed by an @xmath26 chern - simons term . with nonzero fi deformation ,",
    "the vacuum structure becomes more complicated than that for the gauge theory with zero chern - simons term , as one also finds partially higgsed phases .",
    "the seiberg duality maps a branch of vacuum to another definite branch in the dual theory . due to the presence of partially unbroken chern - simons gauge symmetry",
    ", it turns out that the study of non - topological vortices is also crucial for the seiberg duality invariance of the vortex spectrum . from our index for topological vortices ,",
    "we study aspects of the seiberg - dual non - topological vortices . in some simple cases ,",
    "our topological vortex index confirms nontrivial properties of non - topological vortices suggested in the literature via seiberg duality .",
    "namely , we show that the vorticity and angular momentum of non - topological vortices in the chern - simons - matter theory with @xmath23 satisfy a bound required by a tensionless domain wall picture of @xcite , via topological vortex calculation of the seiberg - dual theory .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we explain @xmath0 field theories , bps topological vortices , and then derive the vortex partition functions ( or indices ) . in section 3 , we show that these partition functions nontrivially confirm the known seiberg dualities of some @xmath2 theories with fi deformations .",
    "we then suggest a wide extension of this duality , presumably at new kinds of ir fixed points .",
    "we also study @xmath3 seiberg dualities from vortices .",
    "section 4 concludes with discussions .",
    "appendices a , b , c explain the structure of vortex quantum mechanics and also a derivation of the vortex partition function .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath2 @xmath8 gauge theory with @xmath14 fundamental hypermultiplets .",
    "its bosonic global symmetry is @xmath27 coming from spacetime , @xmath28 r - symmetry which rotates the supercharges as a vector , and an @xmath29 flavor symmetry .",
    "it has a vector supermultiplet consisting of the gauge field @xmath30 , gaugino @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 are @xmath33 and @xmath34 doublet indices , respectively , and @xmath35 is for @xmath27 spinors ) , and three scalars @xmath36 ( @xmath37 for @xmath33 triplet ) .",
    "the hypermultiplets consist of @xmath14 pairs of complex scalars @xmath38 in the fundamental representation of @xmath8 , where @xmath39 , and superpartner fermions @xmath40 .",
    "the supercharges @xmath41 are taken to be majorana spinors involving @xmath42 conjugations .",
    "the bosonic part of the action is given by @xmath43 ^ 2\\right ]    -d^\\mu q^\\dag_{i\\dot{a}}d_\\mu q^{i\\dot{a } }    -q^\\dag_{i\\dot{a}}\\phi^i\\phi^iq^{i\\dot{a}}-\\frac{1}{2g_{ym}^2}d^ad^a\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the triplet index for @xmath34 , and @xmath45 with three pauli matrices @xmath46 .",
    "the moduli space of this theory has two parts .",
    "the classical coulomb branch is obtained by taking @xmath36 to be nonzero and all diagonal , while all hypermultiplet scalars are set to zero .",
    "the higgs branch is obtained by taking @xmath47 , while nonzero @xmath48 satisfy the condition @xmath49 .",
    "the real dimension of the higgs branch moduli space ( modded out by the action of gauge transformation ) is @xmath50 . as we shall be mainly interested in the higgs branch which supports vortex solitons , and also due to the motivation of studying seiberg duality",
    ", we shall restrict our studies to the theories satisfying @xmath51 .",
    "the coulomb and higgs branches meet at least at a point in which all fields are set to zero .",
    "they may meet more nontrivially in the presence of the vacua with partially unbroken gauge symmetry when @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "one can also introduce fayet - iliopoulos deformations for the overall @xmath53 part of @xmath8 , which leaves the form of the ( bosonic ) action as ( [ bosonic - n=4 ] ) but changes the d - term fields @xmath54 to @xmath55 with three real constants @xmath56 .",
    "nonzero fi parameters break @xmath34 to @xmath53 . without losing generality",
    ", we can take @xmath57 and other two to be zero .",
    "it will also be convenient to call @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the vacuum condition @xmath60 can be written as @xmath61 the hypermultiplet scalar should be nonzero and totally break @xmath8 gauge symmetry , lifting the coulomb branch . with @xmath62 , a subspace of the higgs branch moduli space which will be useful",
    "later is obtained by setting @xmath63 .",
    "the second equation of ( [ higgs ] ) is then solved by picking a @xmath8 subgroup of @xmath29 , and taking @xmath64 where we view @xmath65 as an @xmath66 rectangular matrix .",
    "the possible embeddings of @xmath8 yields a vacuum moduli subspace given by the grassmannian @xmath67}$ ] . at any point , @xmath68=\\frac{u(n)\\times u(n_f - n)}{u(1)}$ ] global symmetry remains unbroken .    with nonzero @xmath10 ( @xmath69 )",
    ", there exist bps vortex solitons on the above subspace given by @xmath63 .",
    "the bps equations can be obtained either from supersymmetry transformations or by complete - squaring the bosonic hamiltonian @xcite , which are @xmath70 we have chosen to study vortices with @xmath71 , rather than anti - vortices .",
    "the bps mass of the vortices is given by @xmath72 .",
    "there is a moduli space of the solution , with real dimension @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "these vortices preserve @xmath74 real supersymmetries @xmath75 and @xmath76 among the full @xmath77 supercharges @xmath41 , where @xmath78 denote @xmath27 spinor components in the eigenspinor basis of @xmath79 . the vortex quantum mechanics model which we introduce",
    "later explicitly preserves @xmath80 , which shall be written as @xmath81 .",
    "the nature of topological vortices depends on whether @xmath82 or @xmath83 . when @xmath82 , the @xmath84 dimensional vortex moduli space consists of @xmath85 translation zero modes of @xmath86 vortices and @xmath87 internal zero modes .",
    "the @xmath88 complex zero mode per vortex can be understood as the embedding moduli of @xmath53 abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) vortex into @xmath8 .",
    "namely , the internal moduli of a single vortex is @xmath89 . when @xmath90 , @xmath91 extra internal zero modes exist .",
    "there are noncompact directions from these extra modes , as vortices can now come with size moduli .",
    "these vortices are called semi - local vortices .",
    "the low energy dynamics of these vortices can be studied in various ways .",
    "it can be studied by a d - brane realization of the qft and vortices @xcite , as we shall review shortly .",
    "also , one can perform a careful moduli space approximation in the field theory context , which has been done in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that some of the dynamical degrees kept in the naive d - brane considerations @xcite originates from non - normalizable zero modes @xcite from the field theory viewpoint . more concretely ,",
    "supposing that we introduce an ir cut - off regularization of length scale @xmath92 , it was shown that the mechanical kinetic terms for the last modes pick up a factor proportional to @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "after carefully redefining variables in a way that ir divergence does not appear , it was shown in the single vortex sector that the khler potential for the quantum mechanical sigma model differs from that derived from the d - brane approach @xcite .",
    "let us explain the difference in some detail and clarify our viewpoint on the index calculation .",
    "our claim is that the index will be the same no matter which vortex quantum mechanics is used , as the index is insensitive to various continuous parameters of the theory .",
    "if one could find a continuous supersymmetric deformation between the string - inspired model of @xcite and more rigorously derived field theory models , this would prove our claim . actually at @xmath94 ,",
    "the two khler potentials of @xcite and @xcite can be written as @xmath95 with @xmath96 , where the summations over @xmath97 range in @xmath98 , and those over @xmath99 range in @xmath100 .",
    "deforming the former khler potential to the latter one in a continuous way will prove that there is a supersymmetric deformation between the two .",
    "of course there is an issue on the non - compact region .",
    "as we shall illustrate with detailed calculations in the appendices , our index can be completely determined from the information of the moduli space near the region where @xmath101 , at which the vortex sizes are minimal .",
    "so we can ignore any possible difference in the asymptotic behaviors of the two metrics . by inserting @xmath102 to all @xmath103 in @xmath104 , and also multiplying @xmath105 to the first two terms of @xmath104 ,",
    "one obtains a 1-parameter deformation of the kahler potential . by taking the @xmath106 limit",
    ", one finds that @xmath104 reduces to the exact field theory result @xmath107 .",
    "although the above kind of comparison can be made only when the moduli space metric is explicitly known , we expect the same phenomenon to appear for multi - vortices .",
    "this is because our index is only sensitive to the region near minimal size semi - local vortices , and all concrete studies from qft @xcite suggest that the difference between the two approaches will be absent in this region .",
    "in particular , the second reference in @xcite discusses this point for some multi - vortex configurations .",
    "we also mention that @xcite finds certain bps spectrum of the two models agree with each other . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we shall be working with the models like @xcite derived from the naive d - brane pictures , to derive the index .",
    "seiberg - dual pairs with nonzero fi parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the red lines denote d1-brane vortices.,width=642 ]    one can engineer the above gauge theories and vortices from branes in type iib string theory , as shown in fig [ n=4-brane ] .",
    "the d3-branes , ns5-branes , d5-branes are along @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 directions , respectively . when @xmath12 , @xmath111 d3-brane segments connect two ns5-branes and can move in the @xmath112 direction along the ns5-brane worldvolume .",
    "this forms the coulomb branch , with @xmath113 showing the @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "extra @xmath14 d3-branes connect the ns5-brane on the right side ( ns5@xmath114 ) and the @xmath14 d5-branes . the open strings connecting",
    "the two sets of d3-branes provide the fundamental hypermultiplet matters .",
    "the seiberg duality that we shall explore in this paper corresponds to moving the two ns5-branes across each other . by the brane creation effect @xcite",
    ", the number of d3-branes between the two ns5-branes after this crossing is @xmath115 .",
    "turning on nonzero fi term corresponds to moving one ns5-brane along its transverse @xmath116 directions , parametrized by the @xmath34 triplet @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath111 d3-branes can not finish on ns5@xmath114-brane preserving supersymmetry .",
    "so one has to combine them with @xmath111 of the @xmath14 flavor d3-branes , as shown on the left side of fig [ n=4-brane ] .",
    "the remaining @xmath115 d3-branes connect the ns5@xmath114-brane and the d5-branes .",
    "fig [ n=4-brane ] shows the two brane configurations after we move two ns5-branes across them in the @xmath117 direction . in both cases , there exist bps d1-branes ( as shown by the red segment ) , corresponding to the bps vortices",
    ".    it will also be helpful to understand the supersymmetry preserved by these branes .",
    "the ns5- , d5- , and d3-branes preserve supersymmetries which satisfy definite projection conditions for @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 @xcite , where @xmath121 from type iib chirality .",
    "all three projectors commute . from @xmath122    \\cdot\\left[(i\\sigma_2)\\otimes\\gamma^{0126}\\right]\\ , \\ ] ] two projection conditions imply the third .",
    "so one finds a @xmath123-bps configuration , preserving @xmath124 real or 3d @xmath2 susy .",
    "more concretely , the @xmath124 susy may be obtained as follows .",
    "taking the @xmath117 commuting matrices , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ; @xmath127 , @xmath128 ; @xmath129 , @xmath130 , one can write @xmath131 and also write the @xmath7 projectors as @xmath132 respectively .",
    "the @xmath133 real components of the type iib spinor can be obtained by starting from @xmath134 dimensional real spinor ( with @xmath133 components from 10d and @xmath135 components from @xmath136 pauli matrices ) , and subjecting them to the chirality condition . however",
    ", the matrices @xmath137 do not commute with the chirality operator @xmath138 .",
    "so to obtain the eigenspinors of the bps projections using @xmath139 eigenstates , one would always have to make a linear combination of different eigenstates of @xmath137 at the final stage , to make them eigenstates of @xmath138 .",
    "supposing that 1st/3rd projectors for ns5/d3-branes come with @xmath140 eigenvalues , one has @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , where the @xmath78 signs are correlated .",
    "the possible signs of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath144 come in @xmath124 cases @xmath145 for the upper signs , and @xmath124 cases @xmath146 for the lower signs , where @xmath147 are independent @xmath78 signs . since the @xmath137 do not commute with @xmath138 but rather anticommute , we should mutiply @xmath148 to the spinors to get 10d chiral spinors .",
    "we can define @xmath149 .",
    "the chirality projection only keeps the combination @xmath150 , and we finally have @xmath124 or 3d @xmath77 susy .    the supersymmetry for d1-brane vortex is given by the projector @xmath151 @xcite , supposing that the fi parameter is separating two ns5-branes along the @xmath152 direction .",
    "this again commutes with the remaining two projections , and makes the vortex preserve @xmath74 real susy .",
    "more concretely , let us assume that @xmath153 has @xmath140 eigenvalue . in the above two classes of @xmath78 sign , we can take either @xmath154 , @xmath155 before @xmath138 projection , yielding @xmath156 or @xmath157 .",
    "thus , one has @xmath124 spinors before projection , and after @xmath138 projection one obtains @xmath74 susy . as the two ns5-branes cross",
    ", the d1-brane in the @xmath8 theory and @xmath158 theory appears as vortex / anti - vortex , respectively , depending on whether the d - string starts or ends on the brane on which the 3d gauge theory lives .",

    "one can also study vortices in the @xmath26 theory with an fi deformation .",
    "we first review the @xmath26 theory with fi term and its vacua .",

    "one first finds that the coulomb branch is lifted .",
    "this is because @xmath164 acquires nonzero mass either from a superpartner of the chern - simons term , or by the higgs mechanism . with @xmath165 ,",
    "one finds many partially higgsed branches . for simplicity",

    "the classical supersymmetric vacuum with @xmath63 can be obtained from the following equations , @xmath166 where we have set @xmath167 ( with @xmath168 ) as they will also be zero when the fi term is along the third component @xmath169 only .",
    "the simplest solution is obtained by setting @xmath170 . then the condition @xmath171 simply yields the @xmath172 moduli space .",
    "more generally @xcite , we can take an @xmath173 block of the @xmath174 matrix @xmath175 to be nonzero .",

    "@xmath388 are lifting , or regularizing , these zero modes .",
    "so we shall call them as the center - of - mass index @xmath389 for a single super - particle . to get the real information on bound state degeneracies",

    "just like the instanton index in 5d theories studied in @xcite , expanding ( [ com ] ) in the fugacity is ambiguous .",
    "however , just as in @xcite , it suffices to identify a factor of ( [ com ] ) as accompanying the translation degree per super - particle , factored out from the more informative internal degeneracy factor .",
    "in fact , as we shall explain in more detail in the next section , one always obtains a single factor of ( [ com ] ) when one extracts out the single particle partition function from the general multi - particle result ( [ general - index ] ) .",
    "this factor is also ignored in all sorts of bound state counting with translational zero modes .",
    "the remaining factor in ( [ single - index - n4 ] ) is more nontrivial . for the case with @xmath391 , namely for local vortices ,",
    "this remainder becomes very simple after one sums over @xmath111 saddle points . with explicitly summing over them for a few low values of @xmath111",
    ", one can easily confirm that @xmath392 for @xmath82 .",
    "the number of states @xmath393 from the internal part of moduli space is finite , which is simply due to the compactness of the internal moduli space @xmath394 for local vortices .",
    "so , as the trace expression ( [ index - trace ] ) obviously implies , the index for @xmath82 can be naturally regarded as a witten index counting degeneracy",

    "two interpretations were provided to such an internal index in different contexts @xcite .",
    "firstly in the coulomb branch in which @xmath8 is broken to @xmath397 , the signs of the noether charges for @xmath397 are fixed in a bps sector , making the expansion of the denominator unambiguous .",
    "secondly , in the symmetric phase , in which the whole @xmath8 gauge symmetry is unbroken , the same index was proven to be a superconformal index which counts gauge invariant operators , after a well - defined @xmath8 singlet projection . here for semi - local vortices , it seems that the vortex partition function is similar to neither of the two cases .",
    "as @xmath68 $ ] is a global symmetry , the gauge invariance projection is unnecessary .",
    "also , since this symmetry is unbroken , there is no fixed sign for their cartans either .",
    "rather , one should expand the expression ( [ single - index - n4 ] ) into the irreducible characters of the global symmetry .",
    "we have attempted this expansion of ( [ single - index - n4 ] ) .",
    "it does not clearly work in an unambiguous way , essentially due to an ambiguity on how to go around the poles in ( [ single - index - n4 ] ) .",
    "so for semi - local vortices , we do not have a clear understanding of its witten index interpretation , despite its formal expression ( [ index - trace ] ) as trace over hilbert space .",
    "perhaps a new interpretation of noncompact internal modes from a parton - like picture @xcite might be necessary .    even without a solid index interpretation",
    ", we can get useful information from them , regarded a kind of supersymmetric partition functions on @xmath1 . in the next section ,",

    "we set @xmath402 for the @xmath26 theory .",
    "seiberg dualities for @xmath2 gauge theories in a naive form are motivated by branes @xcite .",

    "on the right side of the figure there are @xmath268 d3-branes stretched between two ns5-branes .",
    "so one obtains an @xmath77 @xmath158 gauge theory coupled to @xmath14 matters . supposing that both theories flow to scft",
    ", one would have obtained a brane realization of two qft with same ir fixed point , and thus a seiberg - like duality . however , as shown in @xcite , this happens only under a restrictive condition .",
    "the main method of @xcite is to study the r - charges of bps magnetic monopole operators in the uv theory , and see if they can sensibly saturate the superconformal bps bounds for the scale dimensions of local operators in ir . picking an @xmath292 r - charge @xmath296 ( given by @xmath326 in the notation of our previous section ) , the bps scale dimensions @xmath405 of chiral monopole operators saturate the bound @xmath406 from the unitarity bound , the scale dimensions these operators should satisfy @xmath407 .",
    "so if any of the monopole operators have @xmath296 smaller than @xmath18 , the qft can not flow to an @xmath77 scft , at least not in a way that uses the uv @xmath16 r - charges as the superconformal r - charges in ir .",
    "@xcite refers to this as the absence of ` standard ir fixed point . '",
    "considering the monopole operator with the @xmath8 gno charge @xmath408 , with integer entries , one obtains the following r - charge @xmath409 of the monopole operator . plugging in @xmath410 charge ,",
    "one obtains a simple necessary condition @xmath411 for the existence of a standard fixed point . indeed , if this condition is satisfied , there are no violations of the unitarity bound for other monopole operators @xcite .",
    "now considering the putative seiberg - dual pair with same number @xmath14 of flavors and the ranks of gauge groups being @xmath111 and @xmath268 , respectively , it is difficult to have both theories in the pair to satisfy the bound ( [ n=4-unitarity ] ) .",
    "such cases are @xcite @xmath21 when @xmath14 is even , and @xmath19 or @xmath412 when @xmath14 is odd .",
    "the first case is self seiberg - dual , and the next two cases are seiberg - dual to each other ( with fixed @xmath14 ) .",
    "so the only possible nontrivial seiberg duality with standard fixed point will be between the theory with @xmath19 and another with same @xmath14 and rank @xmath88 .    however , even the last seiberg duality has to be understood with care , because there exists an operator which saturates the unitarity bound @xmath413 when @xmath19 .",
    "the operator with scale dimension @xmath18 should correspond to a free field , or a free twisted hypermultiplet @xcite .",
    "in particular , the case with @xmath414 belongs to this case , in which case the naive seiberg dual has rank @xmath415 that the former can not be dual to nothing .",
    "thus , even the theory with @xmath19 can not be seiberg - dual to its ` naive dual ' in the simplest sense .",
    "the modified proposal is that the theory with @xmath416 is dual to its naive dual times a decoupled theory of a free twisted hypermultiplet @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in detail , the decoupled sector comes from the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) vortices created by the monopole operator with dimension @xmath18 .",
    "now let us study these dualities using vortex partition functions .",

    "the fi parameter @xmath277 appearing in section 2.2 corresponds to the distance between the two ns5-branes . exchanging the two ns5-branes",
    "corresponds to changing the sign of @xmath277 .",
    "thus , the vortex partition function for the ` naive dual ' theory can be obtained from the original theory by tracing the effects of this sign change . in the @xmath77 theory ,",
    "the only change is that the roles of @xmath275 variable @xmath176 and the @xmath276 variable @xmath419 are exchanged .",
    "so one is naturally led to compare vortex / anti - vortex spectra in the dual pair as we explained in the previous section , as the representations under @xmath267 are conjugated after @xmath309 are exchanged .",
    "two vortex partition functions have different saddle points , either labeled by division of @xmath86 into @xmath111 integers in the original theory , or into @xmath268 integers in the naive dual . to obtain the partition function of the naive dual from the original one",

    "the last sign flip is needed as the variables @xmath176/@xmath419 charged in @xmath8 and @xmath158 change their roles , making their charges flip signs .",
    "this flip can be undone by flipping the signs of @xmath388 , as the index is manifestly invariant under the sign flips of all @xmath420 .",

    "they apparently take very different forms , as the first and second are sums over @xmath111 and @xmath268 terms , respectively . after summation",
    ", we find that they are related in a simple manner . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the case in which @xmath426 : the other case with @xmath427 can be obtained from this by changing the roles of two theories .",
    "then , one finds that @xmath428 where @xmath429 is the character for the @xmath430 dimensional representation of @xmath160 . by definition ,",
    "we have checked this expression for many cases , varying @xmath354 .",
    "note that , even if @xmath432 and @xmath433 separately depend on @xmath434 , their difference on the right hand side does not .",
    "the result says that the single vortex states in the ` naive ' dual pair are actually not the same .",
    "rather , the theory with larger gauge group rank @xmath111 ( @xmath435 ) has more states given by the simple expression on the right hand side of ( [ single - duality ] ) .",
    "the right hand side could be naturally explained if the excess states appear in a definite @xmath33 representation and are neutral in @xmath311 and @xmath308 . in particular , when @xmath19 ,",
    "the above formula ( [ single - duality ] ) becomes @xmath436 implying that the excess state at @xmath384 is just one more single - particle state .",
    "this can appear if the @xmath8 theory is dual to the @xmath22 theory ( the naive dual ) times a decoupled twisted hypermultiplet with unit vorticity as suggested in @xcite .",
    "a more reassuring relation is found at @xmath437 order .",
    "we find that @xmath438 where @xmath439 combined with the @xmath384 order results , this suggests that the exact relation between the two vortex partition functions is @xmath440\\ .\\ ] ] expanding both sides up to @xmath437 , one recovers ( [ single - duality ] ) and ( [ two - duality ] ) .",
    "we have also checked ( [ exact - duality ] ) at @xmath441 for a few low values of @xmath442 . at @xmath19 ,",
    "the exponential factor on the right hand side becomes @xmath443\\ , \\ ] ] which is exactly the multi - particle index one obtains from a free twisted hypermultiplet with unit vorticity : the single particle index is given by @xmath444 .",
    "this precisely supports the seiberg duality of @xcite .",
    "it is also very natural that this free field carries unit vorticity , as this decoupled sector is suggested from the existence of a monopole operator with gno charge @xmath445 saturating the unitarity bound .",
    "the above free field states should naturally be regarded as being created by this monopole operator .",
    "it is also interesting to find that the vortex partition functions of the two ` naive ' dual pairs are related in a very simple manner for general @xmath51 , although not being completely equal . first of all , let us insert @xmath391 to ( [ exact - duality ] ) .",
    "then one obtains @xmath446    = \\exp\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}i_{\\rm com}(n\\gamma , n\\gamma^\\prime)\\chi_n(n\\gamma\\!-\\!n\\gamma^\\prime)q^n\\right]\\ , \\ ] ] as @xmath447 from the absence of vortices when the gauge group rank is zero .",
    "thus , when @xmath82 , the index is independent of the flavor fugacities @xmath339 and takes the form of the multiparticle states of unit vortices . from the single particle index @xmath448 in the exponent , one finds @xmath111 different species of ideal vortex particles .",
    "the above partition function may be implying that the low energy theory could be a free theory of @xmath111 twisted hypermultiplets .",
    "when @xmath23 , one simply gets a free theory description of the ( massless ) ano vortex at low energy .    secondly , inserting ( [ local - index ] )",
    "back to ( [ exact - duality ] ) , one obtains @xmath449 one may interpret this as implying a novel form of ir duality in which the theory with @xmath450 is dual to the naive seiberg dual times a decoupled sector , given by the @xmath451 theory with @xmath430 flavors .",
    "there should be very nontrivial requirements for this to be true .",
    "firstly , as the global flavor symmetry of the naive duals matches to be @xmath417 in the uv description , the @xmath451 flavor symmetry of the latter decoupled factor is not visible .",
    "so there should be a @xmath451 symmetry enhancement of the theory with @xmath450 in ir , for the above factorized duality to be true .",
    "at the level of vortex partition function , the latter @xmath452 flavor symmetry is invisible due to the disappearance of its chemical potentials in the partition function , as explained in the previous paragraph .",
    "the way how such an ir @xmath452 symmetry enhancement could appear is suggested by the vortex partition function itself .",
    "as the decoupled factor on the right hand sides of ( [ exact - duality-2 ] ) and ( [ exact - duality ] ) is a multi - particle ( or plethystic ) exponential of ideal vortex particles , appearance of @xmath430 species of decoupled vortex particles in ir could provide @xmath451 enhanced symmetry which rotates them .",
    "such a generalized duality also makes sense if one considers massless sectors .",
    "the coulomb branches of both theories ( at @xmath299 ) have dimension @xmath453 , precisely after including the decoupled sector to the naive seiberg dual . by studying the coulomb / higgs moduli spaces ,",
    "it was already noted in @xcite that theories with @xmath454 have some free vector multiplets ( or twisted hypermultiplets ) in ir , as complete higgsing is impossible .",
    "our finding may be regarded as a concrete characterization of this observation as a generalized seiberg duality .",
    "one might think that the vortex partition function is a rather special quantity , probing the @xmath63 region of the higgs branch only . as a further support",
    ", we also note that a factorization like ( [ exact - duality-2 ] ) was observed from the 3-sphere partition function , briefly mentioned in the conclusion of @xcite . using various relations proved in @xcite",
    ", one can easily show this factorization as follows .",
    "the 3-sphere partition function of a supersymmetric gauge theory is a function of the fi parameter , which they call @xmath455 , and the real masses @xmath456 ( @xmath334 ) .",

    "the structure of the formula inside the parenthesis is such that @xmath14 masses are divided into @xmath111 and @xmath268 groups .",
    "therefore , apart from the factor @xmath460 the expression is invariant under replacing @xmath111 by @xmath268 , i.e. going to its naive seiberg - dual . in particular , one obtains @xmath461_{\\{m\\}}\\nonumber\\\\    & = & ( -1)^{n(n_f - n)}\\left(\\frac{i^{n_f-1}e^{\\pi\\eta}}{1+(-1)^{n_f-1}e^{2\\pi\\eta } }    \\right)^{n}\\left(\\frac{i^{n_f-1}e^{-\\pi\\eta}}{1+(-1)^{n_f-1}e^{-2\\pi\\eta}}\\right)^{n - n_f }    e^{2\\pi i\\eta\\sum_{j=1}^{n_f}m_j}z^{n_f - n}_{n_f}(-\\eta , m_i)\\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\left(\\frac{i^{n_f-1}e^{\\pm\\pi\\eta}}{1+(-1)^{n_f-1}e^{\\pm 2\\pi\\eta } }    \\right)^{2n - n_f}e^{2\\pi i\\eta\\sum_{j=1}^{n_f}m_j}z^{n_f - n}_{n_f}(-\\eta , m_i)\\nonumber\\\\    & = & ( -1)^{n_f(n_f - n)}\\left(\\frac{i^{(2n - n_f)-1}e^{\\pm\\pi\\eta}}{1+(-1)^{(2n - n_f)-1 }    e^{\\pm 2\\pi\\eta}}\\right)^{2n - n_f}e^{2\\pi i\\eta\\sum_{j=1}^{n_f}m_j}z^{n_f - n}_{n_f}(-\\eta , m_i )    \\nonumber\\\\    & = & ( -1)^{n_f(n_f - n)}z_{2n - n_f}^{2n - n_f}(\\pm\\eta;\\sum_{j=1}^{2n - n_f}m_j=    \\pm\\sum_{j=1}^{n_f}m_j)z_{n_f}^{n_f - n}(-\\eta;m_i)\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , apart from the possible @xmath382 sign for odd @xmath462 , the partition function of the theory with @xmath450 factorizes into two , to the naive seiberg - dual partition function and another one with both @xmath354 replaced by @xmath463 .",

    "it should be interesting to study this possibility of novel ir fixed points further , and hopefully to shed more light on possible phases of 3d supersymmetric theories .",
    "we hope the clues provided by the vortex partition function in this paper and the 3-sphere partition function of @xcite could provide guiding information for uncovering some aspects of this subject .",
    "incidently , @xcite studied the @xmath292 seiberg dualities of @xcite in the context of 3-sphere partition function and z - extremization , and made a similar observation that ir symmetry enhancement and appearance of a free sector are needed .",
    "also , studies of enhanced symmetry and novel ir fixed points in 4 dimensions are made recently in @xcite , using the superconformal indices .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath26 ( yang - mills ) chern - simons - matter theories with @xmath183 gauge group and @xmath14 fundamental hypermultiplets .",
    "these theories have seiberg duality as discussed in @xcite : the above theory is proposed to be dual to the @xmath465 theory with @xmath14 hypermultiplets . the duality is proposed to hold in the range @xmath466 .",
    "this duality has been studied in quite a detail .",
    "the 3-sphere partition function was studied in @xcite , which proved mostly numerical agreements between the modulus of the two seiberg - dual partition functions . in @xcite ,",
    "the superconformal indices of some dual pairs are studied and agreements were shown for certain low values of @xmath467 . in the discussion section , we shall point out a subtlety in this index comparison for more general values of these parameters , and suggest a possible resolution .",
    "similar issues for @xmath300 seiberg dualities have been already addressed in @xcite , which we also revisit later .    in this subsection",
    ", we study the proposed seiberg - dual pair theories after deforming them by an fi parameter , and also discuss the vortex partition function .",
    "as explained in section 2 , the fi deformed chern - simons - matter ( or yang - mills - chern - simons - matter ) theory has many different branches of partially higgsed vacua .",
    "the partially higgsed vacuum with unbroken @xmath468 gauge symmetry should be dual to the vacuum with unbroken @xmath469 symmetry @xcite .",
    "so to discuss seiberg duality , one inevitably has to understand the vortex spectrum in the ( partially ) unbroken phase .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , there exist two types of brane / string configurations carrying nonzero vorticity .",
    "first type is the topological vortices given by the d1-brane stretched between d3-branes corresponding to broken gauge groups and the flavor d3-branes and/or the 5-brane , as shown in fig [ n=3-brane ] .",
    "another possible type is the fundamental string stretched between the d3-branes corresponding to the unbroken gauge symmetry and other branes , also shown in fig [ n=3-brane ] . since",
    "fundamental strings are charged under the unbroken @xmath468 or @xmath469 chern - simons gauge field , nonzero vorticity is induced .",
    "this yields non - topological vortices @xcite .",
    "let us also consider their bps masses .",
    "d1-brane vortices have masses which are integer multiples of @xmath205 .",
    "the masses of fundamental strings are integer multiples of @xmath470 , as this length is determined by a triangle formed by the @xmath189 brane in fig [ n=3-brane ] .",
    "so in general , when one compares the spetra of the seiberg - dual pair in partially broken phases with generic chern - simons level @xmath471 , one would have both integral and fractional vortices .",
    "here we first comment on the spectra when one of the pair theories is in the totally higgsed phase . in the brane picture",
    ", we have @xmath472 on the left side of fig [ n=3-brane ] .",
    "then , all vorticies in this theory are topological , having integer multiples of @xmath205 as their masses . on the other hand ,",
    "the seiberg - dual theory is in a vacuum with unbroken @xmath473 chern - simons gauge symmetry .",
    "so one might naively think that the dual theory would have fractional vortices with massses being multiples of @xmath470 , invalidating the duality invariance of the spectrum .",
    "a possible resolution goes as follows .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath474 chern - simons gauge fields , or the yang - mills chern - simons gauge fields , with @xmath475 supersymmetry is supposed to be very nontrivial . in @xmath184 @xmath475 ym - cs theory , integrating out the fermions in the vector multiplet with mass @xmath476 at low energy yields a 1-loop shift to the @xmath477 part of the chern - simons level .",
    "it shifts as @xmath478 when @xmath479 , and oppositely when @xmath480 so that the absolute value of the level decreases .",
    "the point @xmath481 is special as the 1-loop corrected level vanishes .",
    "thus , the @xmath482 part of the theory is confining at low energy @xcite .",
    "this is because the remaining gauge dynamics is governed by pure @xmath482 yang - mills theory at zero cs level . as the bps fundamental strings are in the fundamental representation of @xmath482",
    ", one should only consider those forming gauge singlets in the confining phase .",
    "the only way of making gauge singlets with bps matters in fundamental representation is to form @xmath482 baryons using totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "thus , gauge singlet non - topological vortices come in @xmath204-multiples of the above fundamental string , with their masses being multiples of @xmath205 .",
    "compared to the topological vortices , the classical and quantum aspects of non - topological vortices seem to be relatively ill - understood .",
    "so what we can do in generic case is predicting the quantum degeneracy of non - topological vortices via duality by studying topological ones .",
    "however , in a simple case , we can do more by using various effective treatments of non - topological vortices and compare with dual topological vortices studied in this paper .",
    "the remaining part of this section is devoted to this study .",
    "consider the theory with @xmath23 at cs level @xmath204 .",
    "( we shall soon restrict to the case with @xmath483 for detailed studies . )",
    "we consider the pure chern - simons matter theory without yang - mills term . turning off @xmath484 as before , the classical bosonic equation of motion",
    "is derived from the following reduced action , as the covariant derivative there is different from ours , @xmath485 .",
    "some of the equations and solutions are also changed below , either due to this difference or just correcting typos there . ]",
    "@xmath486 the two minima @xmath487 and @xmath488 of the potential correspond to the higgs phase and the symmetric phase .",
    "bps equations for both topological / non - topological vortices are given by @xmath489 in @xcite , vortex domain wall was obtained for @xmath479 and upper signs of the bps equations : @xmath490 this is a domain wall along the @xmath491 direction located at @xmath492 , which separates the symmetric phase @xmath488 in @xmath493 and the broken phase @xmath494 in @xmath495 .",
    "the domain wall has the following linear vortex density and monentum density along @xmath491 direction : @xmath496 furthermore , as the bps energy density is given solely by vorticity without having domain wall tension , it was argued @xcite that one can bend this ` tensionless domain wall ' to yield more bps solutions .",
    "the conjecture of @xcite is that , at least for large vorticity , the classical solution for non - topological vortices can be approximated by a droplet of broken phase @xmath497 inside the symmetric phase with @xmath488 , separated by a thin vortex domain wall of arbitrary shape .",
    "it could be possible to quantize this system and count the degeneracy explicitly . in this paper , leaving the full discussion of this problem as a future work , we shall reproduce some characteristic aspects of non - topological vortices coming from the tensionless domain wall picture , using the dual topological vortex index .",
    "this would nontrivially support both seiberg duality as well as the tensionless domain wall picture for non - topological vortices .    as the vorticity and tangential linear monentum density is along the curve of the domain wall ,",
    "the charges of a closed - loop have the following behaviors .",
    "the vorticity is proportional to the circumference @xmath498 of the boundary of the broken phase region , @xmath499 on the other hand , for a closed loop the total momentum cancels to zero while the angular momentum is proportional to the area @xmath162 of the broken phase region : @xmath500 we put a minus sign because @xmath327 is negative for non - topological vortices with @xmath488 region outside the wall .",
    "this can be easily seen by noting that the unbroken region is on the left side of the wall in ( [ wall ] ) , and bending the wall to a non - topological vortex makes a clockwise circulation of the momentum @xmath501 with @xmath502 . as the circumference @xmath498 of a curve gives an upper bound for the area @xmath162 of the region it surrounds by @xmath503 , the vorticity @xmath86 gives an upper bound to the angular momentum @xmath327 as @xmath504 this is reminiscent of the angular momentum bounds for other familiar 2-charge systems .",
    "for instance , @xmath505-bps 2-charge systems which can be realized as wrapped d0-d4 or f1-momentum states all come with the angular momentum bound @xmath506 , where @xmath507 are the two charges . as the electric charge @xmath508 of a non - topological vortex is @xmath204 times the vorticity , the bound ( [ angular - bound ] ) may be written as @xmath509 . just from the viewpoint of vortices ,",
    "this upper bound on @xmath327 is not so obvious , as putting many vortices together would naturally yield a bound on @xmath327 which is linear in @xmath86 .",
    "it is really the collective linear momentum @xmath501 along the domain wall which creates much more angular momentum than the naive expectation .",
    "below , we show this phenomenon at @xmath510 by studying the dual topological vortices in the seiberg - dual theory .",
    "the case with @xmath510 is much simpler as the dual vacuum is in the totally broken phase , admitting topological vortices only .",
    "the cases with @xmath511 involve non - abelian vortex dynamics in the seiberg - duals ( whose domain wall description is not explored ) and a mixture of non - topological / topologica vortices in a given vacuum .    at @xmath510 , one has the @xmath53 theory with @xmath512 hypermultiplet in the unbroken phase .",
    "we take @xmath513 on the left side of fig [ n=3-brane ] . as",
    "the gauge symmetry is unbroken , we only need to consider non - topological vortices discussed above . with @xmath514 , it may seem that there are no d3-branes for the string to end on .",
    "it is clearer to move d5 s to have it between ns5- and @xmath189-branes @xcite .",
    "then the string can have one end on the d5-brane . ] in the seiberg - dual vacuum , on the right side of the figure , the @xmath515 gauge symmetry is broken that it suffices for us to consider topological vortices . in this case , the duality predicts the equality of the non - topological vortex spectrum on one side and the topological vortex spectrum on the other .",
    "we shall study the partition function of the latter and reproduce ( [ angular - bound ] ) at @xmath483 ( up to a subtlety to be explained below ) . the general formula ( [ general - cs - index ] ) at @xmath483 applies to the vortices with @xmath516 at @xmath517 ( i.e. on the left side of fig [ n=3-brane ] ) . to get the seiberg dual anti - vortices at @xmath518 , one again exchanges @xmath339 and @xmath418 in the formula , and then put extra minus signs for all @xmath519 s .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in the single particle bound states .",
    "we numerically obtained the following single particle index @xmath520\\ ] ] till @xmath521 .",
    "for instance , the few leading terms are given by @xmath522 the maximal value of @xmath523 for given @xmath86 can be read off by identifying the term with maximal power in @xmath390 at @xmath524 . there are two cases that we explain separately .    @xmath525    firstly , when @xmath526 with an integer @xmath99 , the terms with maximal angular momentum all come with degeneracy @xmath140 , indicating that the shape of the domain wall curve is indeed rigid so that no degeneracy is generated .",
    "the maximal values of @xmath527 that we find in @xmath528 for @xmath529 are given in table [ maximal ] .",
    "@xmath530 denotes the maximal value of @xmath531 that we find from the single particle index , as the exponent multiplying @xmath532 as @xmath533 in the index .",
    "plotting @xmath86-@xmath534 , one easily finds that we asymptotically find @xmath535 .",
    "as we do not expect the r - charge @xmath311 to scale as a quadrature of @xmath86 , we take it as the asymptotic growth of @xmath536 and find @xmath537 , confirming the property of non - topological vortices .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check the following exact relation @xmath538 for @xmath529 from table [ maximal ] .",
    "this clearly shows that , ignoring the subdominant terms for large @xmath86 , the upper bound is quadratic in @xmath86 with the correct coefficient .",
    "the single particle index for @xmath539 is more complicated and actually hard to understand from the effective domain wall description .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath540 all take the form @xmath541 , where @xmath542 takes the same form as other values of @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath543 denotes a polynomial with smaller angular momenta .",
    "so apart from the @xmath544 factor , we find a similar upper bound in @xmath327 .",
    "we currently do not understand the extra factor at the moment .",
    "perhaps the effective tensionless domain wall picture of @xcite might have a limitation at @xmath526 for some subtle unnoticed reason .",
    "more study is needed to clearly understand this discrepancy .",
    "however , we still find it amusing that @xmath537 indeed holds in other cases .",
    "in this paper , we studied the supersymmetric partition function on @xmath1 for topological vortices in 3d @xmath320 gauge theories , in which a @xmath8 gauge field is coupled to @xmath14 hypermultiplets .",
    "the partition function admits a clear index interpretation for the local vortices when @xmath391 . the index interpretation is subtler for the semi - local vortices for @xmath90 , due to the non - compact internal zero modes . even in the latter case ,",
    "the zero modes are lifted by the flavor ` chemical potentials . '",
    "the partition function is used to study 3d seiberg dualities .",
    "while studying these dualities , it becomes clear that the duality is exchanging the light ( or perhaps massless in the conformal point ) vortices , just like the 4d seiberg duality exchanging elementary particles and magnetic monopoles , etc .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of studying vortices and their partition functions for a better understanding of seiberg dualities , or more generally strongly coupled ir physics , in 3d .",
    "the vortex partition functions imply that there may be more possible seiberg dualities with @xmath2 susy than those addressed in the literature .",
    "namely , the seiberg dualities of uv theories with ` standard ir fixed points ' were suggested and studied in @xcite at @xmath545 , with a decoupled twisted hypermultiplet sector . as seen by the vortex partition function ( and also by the 3-sphere partition function as we reviewed ) , the duality may extend to the whole window @xmath546 , in which a uv theory with @xmath450 is suggested to be dual to the naive seiberg dual times a decoupled sector with @xmath354 replaced by @xmath463 . for this duality to hold ,",
    "enhanced ir symmetries and decoupled free sectors have to appear .",
    "it should be interesting to study these issues further .",
    "we also found interesting vortex spectrum in @xmath26 chern - simons - matter theories , but the structures of the vacua and vortex spectrum are much richer so that more studies are required .",
    "we have compared the vortices in the theory with @xmath23 and @xmath547 , in which we found some nontrivial agreement between the proposed seiberg - dual pair .",
    "there are several directions which we think are interesting",
    ".    it would first be interesting to have a definite index interpretation for the partition function of semi - local vortices at @xmath83 . in @xcite , a parton - like interpretation for these vortex size moduli",
    "more precisely , they considered lump solitons in the @xmath548 sigma model , which are related in ir to our vortices . also , the partons from electrically charge particles in @xcite appear if we mirror dualize the theory we have been discussing in this paper .",
    "a more challenging problem along this line would be the interpretation of the index for 5d instantons @xcite , perhaps with a similar partonic picture which could shed light to the 6d @xmath549 scft in uv .",
    "we would also like to see if the vortex partition function has any relation to the superconformal index which counts magnetic monopole operators @xcite .",
    "this is conceptually well - motivated as monopole operators are basically vortex - creating operators .",
    "also , since the vortex partition function yields a good function of chemical potentials in the conformal limit @xmath550 , it might be plausible to seek for an alternative cft interpretation of this quantity .",
    "the expression of the monopole index in 3d scft is given in @xcite as an infinite series expansion in the gno charges of monopoles .",
    "this contains infinitely many terms , which should be more efficiently written in some cases .",
    "( see next paragraph for a related comment . ) trying to rewrite it using the vortex partition functions could provide an alternative expression for the same quantity .",
    "see @xcite for a related comment .    as a somewhat remotely related subject",
    ", we also remark on tests of 3d seiberg dualities with @xmath475 supersymmetry in the literatures using monopole operators .",
    "in particular , the @xmath26 seiberg dualities of @xcite between chern - simons - matter theories are considered in detail .",
    "monopole operators in chern - simons - matter theories are more complicated than those without chern - simons term , as magnetic fluxes induce nonzero electric charges which should be screened by turning on matter fields .",
    "spectrum of such monopoles has been studied either by using localization technique @xcite to calculate the index , or by actually constructing semi - classical monopole solutions at large chern - simons level @xcite .",
    "tests using the monopole index have been carried out in @xcite for some low values of @xmath551 . however",
    ", if one considers the spectrum in full generality for arbitrary @xmath551 , apparently one seems to find a problem about r - charges of monopoles similar to the @xmath2 monopoles of @xcite .",
    "more concretely , the index measures the charge @xmath552 with a chemical potential , where @xmath553 is the angular momentum of operators on @xmath113 .",
    "this plays a role analogous to the r - charge in the index .",
    "the lowest value of this charge for a given gno charge @xmath408 can be obtained from the index , which is @xmath554 although the index only measures @xmath552 charges , in @xmath3 theories we can separately say what the values of @xmath296 and @xmath553 are .",
    "this is because they are cartans of @xmath34 and spatial @xmath555 rotations , which are both non - abelian .",
    "as non - abelian charges are not renormalized along continuous deformation of the theory , one can trust the values of @xmath296 and @xmath553 obtained from the deformed theory .",
    "similar calculation of non - abelian r - charges was explained in @xcite . using this property ,",
    "one obtains @xmath556 in particular , the expression for the r - charge as seen by the index takes the same form as the r - charges ( [ n=4-r - charge ] ) of @xmath2 monopoles , after replacing @xmath14 by @xmath557 .",
    "as the rank bound suggested for the @xmath3 theory is @xmath558 , @xmath557 plays the role of @xmath14 in many places . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath111 becomes close to @xmath557 , one would have a similar problem of having r - charges , or even @xmath552 , becoming too negative .",
    "practically , the expression for the index in @xcite becomes of little use in some cases .",
    "introducing the fugacity @xmath559 for @xmath552 , the index is given as an expansion with @xmath560 for given gno charge .",
    "however , in various theories with @xmath111 close to @xmath557 , we find the following problem .",
    "the minimal value ( [ r+2j ] ) of @xmath552 becomes negative for some gno charge .",
    "once we find a negative charge , one can find more monopoles such that @xmath552 is unbound from below .",
    "this implies that an expansion in @xmath559 is ill - defined as one sums over all possible gno charges .",
    "in fact , terms with negative powers in @xmath559 should be forbidden for superconformal theories .",
    "this problem arises only at the strongly coupled point in which the t hooft coupling @xmath561 is not small .",
    "the only way this pathological behavior can be eliminated from the index , if we indeed have scft for all @xmath111 in the range @xmath466 , seems to be that the above terms with negative powers in @xmath559 all cancel out with other monopole contributions .",
    "possible cancelations of some monopole contributions to the index for @xmath292 theories of @xcite were discussed in @xcite .",
    "this problem emphasizes the need for a more efficient expression for the index than those presented in @xcite , perhaps using the vortex partition function . also , seeking for a 3d analogue of the recent study of the ` diverging ' 4d superconformal index @xcite could be interesting .",
    "finally , it will be interesting to understand the vortex partition function of the mass - deformed abjm theory @xcite and learn more about the quantum aspects of this system as well as its gravity dual .",
    "some works in this direction have been done in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the witten index for the vacua was calculated in @xcite , both from qft and its gravity dual , fully agreeing with each other .",
