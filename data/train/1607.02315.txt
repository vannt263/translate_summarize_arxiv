    "the search for exact and physically meaningful analytical solutions to einstein equations , describing non  spherical sources , is an endeavour of utmost relevance in general relativity ( see @xcite for a discussion on this point ) .",
    "indeed , the bifurcation ( implied by the israel theorem @xcite ) between the exact spherically symmetric situation ( schwarzschild ) and any other exact static solution representing deviations from it , overrides the fact that deviations from spherical symmetry in compact self - gravitating objects ( white dwarfs , neutron stars ) , are likely to be incidental rather than basic features of these systems , and reinforces the need to have available exact non  spherical interiors , in order to study the physical behaviour of very compact objects .",
    "as it should be expected , this issue has already been considered by many authors in the past . without attempting to be exhaustive ,",
    "let us mention the pioneering work by hernandez jr .",
    "@xcite , where a general method for obtaining solutions describing axially symmetric sources is presented .",
    "such a method , or some of its modifications were used in @xcite - @xcite , to find sources of different weyl space  times .",
    "this problem has also been considered in @xcite-@xcite . however in all these last references the line element has been assumed to satisfy the so called weyl gauge , which of course severely restricts the family of possible sources .",
    "more recently , perfect fluid sources have been presented in @xcite .",
    "however , there exist published results indicating that static , perfect fluid ( isotropic in pressure ) sources are spherical ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this has been confirmed recently for the incompressible isotropic ( perfect fluid ) in @xcite , where it was shown that such a fluid distribution can not be matched to any weyl exterior , even though it has a surface of vanishing pressure .",
    "accordingly we shall assume here principal stresses to be unequal .",
    "in this work we tackle the problem of finding interior solutions to einstein equations , by focusing on the matching of the interior space  time to a given exterior ( vacuum ) solution belonging to the weyl family , on the boundary surface of the fluid configuration .",
    "this is a key issue , since only globally defined solutions ( inside and outside the source ) , may be properly considered as physically meaningful sources of the gravitational field .",
    "otherwise we are bound to introduce shells of matter on the boundary , which would involve physical variables endowed with a dubious interpretation .    as the main ansatz of our approach",
    ", we shall write the interior line element in terms of exterior metric functions evaluated on the boundary surface of the source .",
    "doing so , we shall be able to ensure the fulfilment of junction conditions for any of the interiors obtained in this way .",
    "on the other hand , the exterior solutions may be expressed in terms of the relativistic multipole moments ( rmm ) @xcite@xcite , which in turn can be measured by means of experiments using gyroscopes or test particles ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this fact allows us to relate different physical variables describing the source with the multipole moments of the exterior space ",
    "time , once we have a globally defined solution .    in order to illustrate our method ,",
    "we have obtained the sources for two well known static exteriors , belonging to the family of the weyl metric .",
    "the physical , as well as the geometrical properties of these sources are studied in detail , and the range of the values of the parameters , for which these sources describe physically meaningful situations , is established .",
    "the general line element for a vacuum static axially symmetric space  time , in weyl",
    "canonical coordinates may be written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of their arguments .    for vacuum space ",
    "times , einstein s field equations imply for the metric functions @xmath3 and @xmath4    notice that ( [ meq1 ] ) is just the laplace equation for @xmath5 ( in 2dimensional euclidean space ) , and , furthermore , it is precisely the integrability condition of ( [ meq2 ] ) , that is : given any @xmath5 satisfying ( [ meq1 ] ) , a function @xmath6 satisfying ( [ meq2 ] ) always exists .",
    "this result may be stated as saying that for any `` newtonian '' potential there always exists a specific weyl metric , a well known result .",
    "the general solution of the laplace equation ( [ meq1 ] ) for the function @xmath7 , endowed with an asymptotically flat behaviour , results to be @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are weyl spherical coordinates and @xmath11 are legendre polynomials .",
    "the coefficients @xmath12 are arbitrary real constants which have been named in the literature `` weyl moments '' , although they can not be identified as relativistic multipole moments in spite of the formal similarity between expression ( [ psi ] ) and the newtonian potential .",
    "however these `` weyl moments '' @xmath12 , which provide the so called `` newtonian image '' of the solution , can be expressed as functions of the rmm @xcite .",
    "although the full relations linking both sets of coefficients are extremely complicated , they can be used to obtain relatively simple formulas for the coefficients @xmath13 in situations where the deviation of the relativistic solution from spherical symmetry is small .",
    "this issue has been discussed in some detail in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we can write the line element above , in erez - rosen @xcite , or standard schwarzschild ",
    "tye coordinates @xmath14 or in spheroidal prolate coordinates @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant which will be identified later .    in these prolate",
    "spheroidal coordinates , @xmath7 takes the form @xmath18 being @xmath19 legendre functions of second kind and @xmath20 a set of arbitrary constants .",
    "the corresponding expression for the function @xmath6 , has been obtained by quevedo @xcite .    in terms of the above",
    "coordinates the line element ( [ 1 ] ) may be writen as :    @xmath21}dr^2 +   e^{-2\\left[\\psi-\\psi^s\\right]+   2\\left[\\gamma(r , y)-\\gamma^s\\right]}r^2 d\\theta^2 + e^{-2\\left[\\psi-\\psi^s\\right ] } r^2\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2 , \\label{exterior}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the metric functions corresponding to the schwarzschild solution , namely , @xmath24 , \\label{schwfun}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath17 is easily identified as the schwarzschild mass .",
    "let us now consider an interior solution for a spherically symmetric distribution of perfect fluid , which we write generically as : @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and where @xmath28 is an arbitrary constant and the boundary surface of the source is defined by @xmath29 all this corresponds to the well known incompressible ( homogeneous energy density ) perfect fluid sphere .",
    "the matching of ( [ esferico ] ) with the schwarzschild solution implies @xmath30 .",
    "inspired in the form of ( [ esferico ] ) , we shall now assume for the interior axially symmetric line element :    @xmath31    with @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are functions that , on the boundary surface , equal the metric functions corresponding to the schwarzschild solution ( [ schwfun ] ) , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noticed that for simplicity we consider here only matching surfaces of the form @xmath37 , of course more general surfaces with axial symmetry could however be considered as well .    that ( [ interior ] ) represents a general ( non  spherical ) axially symmetric space  time ,",
    "can be easily seen by transforming such a line element to the general axially symmetric line element , by means of the coordinate transformation @xmath38 , leading to : @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41,\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath42 have to verify the following constraints : @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so that the boundary surface is defined by @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "we shall now turn to the matching ( darmois ) conditions @xcite .",
    "thus the continuity of the first and the second fundamental form across the boundary surface implies the continuity of the metric functions and the continuity of the first derivatives @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , producing : @xmath50 where prime denote partial derivative with respect to @xmath51 and subscript @xmath52 indicates that the quantity is evaluated on the boundary surface .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that we are using global coordinates @xmath53 on both sides of the boundary .",
    "thus , our line element ( [ interior ] ) matches smoothly with any weyl exterior ( [ exterior ] ) , provided conditions([matchingcond ] ) are satisfied .    in the particular case when we want to match our interior with the schwarzschild exterior ,",
    "then @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and the source is a perfect fluid if @xmath56 .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that the metric functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not necessarily vanish in general , as it is apparent from ( [ funcint ] ) .",
    "thus in the most general case ( within the particular case when the exterior is schwarzschild ) we have a non  spherical source matched with the schwarzschild spacetime.at this point we should recall that examples of non  spherical sources smoothly matching with the schwarzschild space ",
    "time , are well known in the literature .",
    "the most notorious , probably being the matching of the szekeres metric @xcite @xcite , as it was shown by bonnor many years ago @xcite .",
    "however , if we demand the source to be represented by a perfect fluid , then we must choose @xmath59 and @xmath60 since , as already mentioned in the introduction , static , perfect fluid ( isotropic in pressure ) sources are spherical ( see @xcite . in this latter case",
    "we recover the homogeneous density solution @xmath61    we shall now see how the field equations constraint further our possible interiors .",
    "let us first analyse the well known case when the interior is spherically symmetric , then @xmath56 , and the physical variables are obtained from the field equations for a perfect fluid , the result is well known and reads ( in relativistic units ) @xmath62 with @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the energy density and the isotropic pressure respectively , and for the mass function @xmath66 we have @xmath67 implying @xmath68    this model , which describes the well known incompressible perfect fluid sphere , is further restricted by the requirement that the pressure be regular and positive everywhere within the fluid distribution , which implies @xmath69 .",
    "as it is evident from ( [ eeesf ] ) the pressure vanishes at the boundary surface .",
    "finally , if we impose the strong energy condition @xmath70 , we should further restrict our model with the condition @xmath71 .",
    "we shall now proceed to consider the general , non  spherical case .",

    "we shall first proceed to proof the above statement , and then we shall provide a general procedure to choose @xmath57 and @xmath58 producing physically meaningful models .",
    "it is always possible to choose the metric functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 such that , once the junction conditions ( [ matchingcond ] ) are satisfied , the angular derivatives of such functions are continuous , i.e. : @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    then , using @xmath86 , we obtain for @xmath87 on the boundary surface :    @xmath88 , \\label{pxxe}\\ ] ]    where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "it can be shown that @xmath95 vanishes on the boundary surface .",
    "this last condition , which follows from the darmois conditions , and therefore is necessary , in order to avoid the presence of shells on the boundary surface , can be obtained at once from a simple inspection of the equation ( 22 ) in @xcite .",
    "we shall now calculate the total mass for any of our models .",
    "we shall see that it always coincides with the relativistic monopole of the exterior solution .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath96 , as in the erez  rosen or the @xmath97 metric ( see the next section ) , it will coincide with the mass parameter of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "however for the @xmath98 metric , @xmath99 , and the total mass does not coincide with the schwarzschild mass ( see the next section ) .    as is well known , both the komar mass @xmath100 and the tolman @xmath101 coincide for the static case .",
    "thus    @xmath102    with an obvious notation .",
    "taking into account @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the determinant of the three ",
    "space metric and @xmath105 denotes the second kind beltrami operator for such a metric .",
    "then we may write for the total mass @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the three dimensional volume element , and @xmath108    next , applying the gauss theorem @xmath109 we obtain for the total mass @xmath110    the above expression yields , for our interior ( [ interior ] ) @xmath111    in the particular case when we match our source with the schwarzschild exterior , we have @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , implying @xmath114 and accordingly @xmath115 .",

    "@xmath126 where ( [ pxy ] , [ eegeneraldet ] ) have been used , and the subscript @xmath127 indicates that the quantity is evaluated at the center of the distribution .    using the conditions above in ( [ ayg ] ) we may write for @xmath128 and @xmath129 @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    ". then we can finally write for @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath133    @xmath134    the so obtained metric functions , satisfy the junction conditions ( [ matchingcond ] ) and produce physical variables which are regular within the fluid distribution .",
    "furthermore the vanishing of @xmath58 on the axis of symmetry , as required by the regularity conditions , necessary to ensure elementary flatness in the vicinity of the axis of symmetry , and in particular at the center ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is assured by the fact that @xmath135 and @xmath136 vanish on the axis of symmetry .",
    "so far we have presented the general procedure to build up sources for the weyl metric , in what follows , we shall illustrate the method with some examples .",
    "we shall first analyse the possible cases of interiors matching with the schwarzschild exterior on the boundary surface .",
    "from ( [ aygdefa ] ) and ( [ aygdef ] ) we see that the most general form of the metric functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 is :    @xmath139    for the particular case when @xmath140 we recover the perfect fluid case with homogeneous energy density , described previously .",
    "therefore , if we look for other perfect fluid solutions ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) , then we should assume that the functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 only depend on @xmath51 ( since all static perfect fluids solutions should be spherically symmetric ) , in which case the einstein equations reduce to : @xmath144    the only possible solution to the above system , satisfying the junction conditions @xmath145 and @xmath146 , is @xmath147 .",
    "indeed , the second equation in ( [ otrofluper ] ) has only two possible solutions , namely : @xmath148 ( where @xmath149 is defined in ( [ esferico ] ) ) .",
    "the first of which implies @xmath150 , whereas the second one is incompatible with the junction conditions .",
    "thus , within the context of our approach , the only possible interior consisting in a perfect fluid and matching with the schwarzschild space ",
    "time on the boundary surface is the spherically symmetric , fluid distribution with homogeneous energy density .",
    "the question about the possible existence of non  spherical sources described by non ",
    "perfect fluids and matching with schwarzschild space ",
    "time on the boundary surface , remains open . in this latter case ,",
    "both @xmath151 and @xmath152 would depend on @xmath153 and therefore should not be spherically symmetric .",
    "however we shall not follow here , this line of research .",
    "instead , we shall looking for sources matching with exterior solutions of the weyl family , others than the schwarzschild space  time .    in what follows we shall construct some interiors which match with some specific known solutions of the weyl family with the additional assumption @xmath61 .      in @xcite",
    "it was shown that it is possible to find a solution of the weyl family , by a convenient choice of coefficients @xmath12 , such that the resulting solution possesses only monopole and quadrupole moments ( in the geroch sense ) . the obtained solution ( @xmath97 )",
    "may be written , as follows : @xmath155 where the zero - th order corresponds to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "it appears that each power in @xmath156 adds a quadrupole correction to the spherically symmetric solution .",
    "now , it should be observed that due to the linearity of laplace equation , these corrections give rise to a series of exact solutions . in other words ,",
    "the power series of @xmath156 may be cut at any order , and the partial summation , up to that order , gives an exact solution representing a quadrupole correction to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "since we are mainly interested in slight deviations from spherical symmetry , we shall consider the m ",
    "q solution , only up to first order in @xmath156 , hereafter referred as @xmath154 .",

    "however , before entering into a detailed discussion of these figures , we shall carry out some calculations with the purpose of providing some information about the `` shape '' of the source .",
    "in particular we shall see how it is related with the relativistic quadrupole moment of the source .    for doing so , using our interior metric",
