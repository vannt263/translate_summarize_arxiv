    "studies of the interactions of matter with the electroweak symmetry breaking sector of the standard model have been very fruitful .",
    "the interactions of quark mass eigenstates with the weak force  a structure inherited from the yukawa couplings of the quarks with the higgs field  must satisfy specific relationships in the standard model , and violations of those would signal physics beyond the sm .",
    "the non - observation of such effects to date places stringent limits on the form of such scenarios .",
    "all quarks except the top quark are only observed when confined inside hadrons , which is a regime where qcd is non - perturbative .",
    "relating observable hadron decays to `` short - distance '' weak dynamics requires precision understanding of the strong force .",
    "lattice qcd offers the prospect of a systematically - improvable method of calculating hadronic properties from first principles . in the past decade theoretical and technological improvements ( in particular the handling of virtual quark - antiquark pairs , the so - called `` unquenched '' calculations ) have allowed the lattice to deliver predictions that are in many cases very precise , have no tunable parameters , and reliably estimate systematic uncertainties . before application of these results to extract electroweak parameters in the @xmath2 system , it is desirable to test them elsewhere , for example in charm .",
    "the cleo - c experiment at the cesr - c electron - positron collider collected large data samples in the charm threshold energy region . coupled with a well - understood detector , these samples enable tests of lattice predictions for charm hadron decays , as well as studies of many other topics . here",
    "i will discuss measurements of the meson decay constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 and branching fractions and form factors for the semileptonic decays @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , i will discuss studies of @xmath6 semileptonic decays , as well as studies of strong force - induced decay phases that are relevant for interferometry in the @xmath2 system .",
    "the cleo - c detector was a symmetric general purpose detector at the cesr - c @xmath7 collider .",
    "the experiment is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the relevant datasets for the following analyses were collected at center of mass energies of approximately 3.77 gev ( the peak of the @xmath8 resonance ) and 4.17 gev .",
    "the former dataset is used for @xmath9  and @xmath10  analyses , and the latter for @xmath6 physics .    at 3.77",
    "gev the only allowed open charm final states are @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; at 4.17 gev the only allowed states involving a @xmath6 meson are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this enables the powerful tagging technique pioneered by mark iii @xcite which uses the presence of a fully reconstructed @xmath0 meson which decays to a tag mode to indicate the existence of its antiparticle .",
    "this is the basis of the technique for measuring absolute branching fractions used in the analyses discussed below : @xmath15 where the @xmath16 are the respective efficiencies .",
    "there are other benefits to tagging : full reconstruction of the visible particles of an event allows a neutrino to be inferred ; the removal of the particles constituting a tag strongly reduces the combinatorics ( and hence backgrounds ) of the rest of the event ; and a judicious choice of @xmath9  tags allows the exploitation of quantum correlations of the initial state to measure phases .",
    "the decays @xmath17 involve a hadronic current ( which can be parametrized by the single scalar `` decay constant '' @xmath18 ) and a leptonic current , which is well understood in the electroweak model .",
    "consequently the branching fraction for such a decay can be written @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the relevant element of the ckm matrix connecting the valence quarks of @xmath21 ( for @xmath10  and @xmath22  this is @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ) .",
    "experiment can measure the quantity @xmath25 ; knowing the decay constant , we can obtain the ckm element , and vice versa .    in a nave quantum mechanical picture , the decay constant",
    "can be thought of as a measure of the wave function of the meson at zero separation between the quarks .",
    "this means it is relevant for processes where the relevant length scales are much smaller than the hadron size , such as the loop diagrams for @xmath26 and @xmath27 mixing .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath28 eigenstates is proportional to @xmath29 ; as this is our primary source of information on @xmath30 , reducing theoretical uncertainty is critical .",
    "the measurements are discussed below .",
    "this analysis @xcite uses the full 818 pb@xmath32 of 3.77 gev data .",
    "one of six hadronic @xmath33  decays is reconstructed as a tag which sets the initial number of @xmath33  decays .",
    "exactly one track is allowed aside from those composing the track ; this is taken as the muon candidate , and must have deposited less than 300 mev in the electromagnetic calorimeter and not have been considered a viable kaon candidate by the particle identification algorithm . if the event has extra calorimeter energy , it is vetoed , to eliminate one prong hadronic @xmath10  decays with @xmath34s .",
