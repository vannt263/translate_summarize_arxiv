    "the most direct observational evidence of the magnetic field strength in neutron star sources is provided by x - ray cyclotron line features .",
    "such quasi - harmonic spectral features are generated by scattering of resonant photons with the electrons embedded in the magnetosphere .",
    "the interaction is multiply resonant because the dirac equation in the presence of a locally uniform magnetic field , * b * , yields discrete perpendicular momentum eigenvalues ( with @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 , but relativistic effects introduce a slight anharmonicity in the rest - frame resonant photon energies : @xmath2           / { \\rm sin}^2 \\theta ,   \\label{eq : nresener}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 tg is the q.e.d . field scale .",
    "as these energies depend non - trivially on the photon s propagation angle with respect to the field , @xmath5 , the emergent spectral features are heavily influenced by the angular distribution of resonant photons as well as by the spatial distribution of electron targets ( i.e. plasma  geometry \" ) and by the scattering region s orientation with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "cyclotron lines have been detected in a number of x - ray pulsar spectra ( nagase 1989 , mihara , 1995 , santangelo et al .",
    "1999 ) and possibly also in the spectra of several gamma ray bursts ( mazets 1981 , 1883 murakami 1988 , yoshida 1991 ) .",
    "while there is a broad consensus on the origin of the former objects , the origin of gamma ray bursts remains highly elusive .",
    "line energies in x - ray pulsars typically fall in the range from 4 to 40 kev , indicating assumes a hydrostatic plasma and is not unique .",
    "models assuming bulk motion of the scattering electrons ( e.g. baushev & bisnovatyi - kogan 1999 ) will produce a doppler - shifted line center , but the narrowness of the lines is then difficult to accomodate . ] scattering of electrons in magnetic fields of up to @xmath6 tg . the case of transient x - ray pulsar a0535 + 26 with an 11 tg field ( @xmath7 ) represents the uppermost limit spectrally determined ( grove 1995 , araya and harding 1996a - b , maisack 1997 ) x - ray pulsars are found in binary systems containing a neutron star . in high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxrb ) , a tenuous accretion wind occurs from the massive companion onto the neutron star surface .",
    "low mass systems have higher accretion rates and disks surrounding the neutron star ( see van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 , for a review ) .",
    "the plasma geometry depends on the mechanism for stopping the accretion flow at the surface of the star , which is not certain in either case .",
    "if shocks form due to radiation pressure in high luminosity sources ( basko & sunyaev 1976 , davidson 1973 , wang and frank 1982 , arons , klein and lea 1985 , 1987 ) or through a collisionless plasma instability in the flow of low luminosity sources ( langer and rappaport 1982 ) , the geometry of the x - ray emitting region will be a quasi - cylindrical column .",
    "this situation sharply contrasts the case of flow stopping through coulomb collisions with the ambient electrons and protons where atmospheres with scale heights of order @xmath8 200 cm are expected ( mszros 1983 , harding 1984 ) .",
    "these possible pictures of the flow provide two idealized , ` orthogonal ' geometric scenarios : plane parallel slabs and cylinders .",
    "one hopes that models of cyclotron line features may provide a sensible diagnostic to determine the geometry of the region where the lines form .",
    "this , in turn , could also help answer some important questions regarding the microphysics involved in the stopping and cooling of the flow .",
    "unfortunately , the production of theoretical cyclotron line features in an entirely self - consistent manner is a formidable task requiring the resolution of a coupled radiation - magnetohydrodynamic system ( e.g. , arons , klein and lea 1987 ) .",
    "even simplified approaches pose extremely difficult problems so the solutions are typically attempted in piecemeal form . for cyclotron features produced in hard incident continua ( as in this investigation )",
    "the work of isenberg , lamb and wang ( 1997 , lamb 1989 , wang 1989 , wang , wasserman and salpeter 1988 ) and of alexander and mszros ( 1989 , alexander , mszros and bussard 1989 ) represent the state of the art calculations and are closely related to the models produced here ( for a comparison , see araya & harding 1999 [ hereafter ah99 ] ) .",
    "our results ensue from a hard incident continuum ( photon number power index = -1 ) throughout the entire energy range .",
    "this is motivated mainly by grb spectra although some x - ray pulsars exhibit a fairly hard x - ray continuum at the characteristic cyclotron energy ( i.e. x0115 + 634 , x0331 + 53 , 4u 1538 - 52 and even a0535 + 26 at 110 kev ) .",
    "a hard incident spectrum allows for an easier interpretation of several processes affecting the formation of the fundamental cyclotron line feature such as relativistic angular redistribution of resonant photons and photon spawning in which electrons excited to higher landau states produce additional photons through cyclotron decay .",
    "the theoretical spectra thus generated greatly aid in the interpretation of real spectra formed in softer continua such as those belonging to some x - ray pulsars ( where the effect of photon spawning is substantially weaker ) .",
    "in ah99 , we presented model cyclotron line features for isotropic photon continuum injection .",
    "it was noted then that radiation transport and resonant scattering efficiently induced a strongly anisotropic radiaton field .",
    "moreover , the radiation processes in very strong magnetic fields and the inherent anisotropy induced by the plasma geometry are unlikely to produce isotropic continuum emission except perhaps deep inside the accretion column or mound . in this paper",
    ", we offer a detail quantification of the emergent angular distribution for isotropically injected photons scattered off electrons with a thermal energy distribution parallel to the field , and expand the calculations to encompass the influence of anisotropic photon injection on the emergent cyclotron line features . in  [ sec : moddesc ] we present a synopsis of the model and its regime of validity .",
    "motivation to the study of anisotropic photon injection and details of its implementation are presented in ",
    "[ sec : motiv ] this scheme is then employed to study the line formation process , the emergent spectral line shapes and the angular distribution of emergent radiation in  [ sec : resdisc ]",
    "the cyclotron line spectra are produced in _ irradiated _ magnetized plasmas without internal photon sources and with _ prescribed _ thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the chief simplification in our treatment of the radiation transport problem is conformity with the high - field / low density regime .",
    "vacuum polarization then determines the photon states , and collisional interactions may be ignored .",
    "we have quantified this and the statements below in ah99 .",
    "the relativistic magnetic compton scattering cross section ( sina 1996 , see ah99 ) includes natural line widths through the use of dressed electron propagators evaluated in the presence of a uniform magnetic field ( graziani 1993 , graziani , harding & sina 1996 ) .",
    "the electron states that permit such construction are simultaneous eigenstates of the _ sokolov - ternov _ ( 1967 ) relativistic spin operator ( see , e.g. , melrose & parle 1983 , sina 1996 ) while the photon polarization states are the magnetized vacuum normal modes uncorrected for dispersion ( shabad 1976 ) .    in the strong field limit ,",
    "use of the normal photon modes yields mode - dependent cross sections which are not substantially different from one another and mode switching branching ratios strongly couple the two modes .",
    "wang , wasserman and salpeter ( 1988 ) thus found that both normal modes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , have comparable mean free paths and contribute about equally to the spectral angular output distributions in slab geometries .",
    "this motivates the treatment of unpolarized photons .",
    "detailed consideration of ` landau - raman ' scattering allows photon spawning from up to fourth harmonic photons with electron momenta sampled from a relativistic thermal energy distribution function @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ( one dimensional ) parallel electron temperature , and @xmath13 , the normalizaton . regarding the landau level populations , one need not consider detailed equilibrium in plasmas which are tenuous and cool relative to the cyclotron energy : for sub - critical fields , the radiative cyclotron de - excitation rate ( latal 1986 ) , @xmath14 , is very large compared with the collisional rate ( bonazzola , heyvaerts and puget 1979 ) , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , all electrons may be safely assumed to be in the ground landau level initially .    in spite of the tenuous environment ,",
    "a thermal characterization is justified by the resonant behavior of the magnetic compton scattering cross section which ensures high optical depth in the line core and strong photon - electron coupling through multiple resonant scattering .",
    "an estimate for the equilibrium electron temperature , obtained from non - relativistic numerical simulations by lamb , wang and wasserman ( 1990 ) , also yields consistent results for hard continua ( ah99 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the nominal cyclotron frequency and @xmath18 the effective power law index at the line .",
    "thus , in our calculations we take @xmath19 kev for @xmath20 , @xmath21 kev for @xmath22 , @xmath23 kev for @xmath24 .",
    "the monte carlo implementation for photon injection , propagation , and scattering permits the spatial diffusion of photons from arbitrary photon source functions and in arbitrary plasma geometries .",
    "a relativistic photon angle redistribution function , accurate for core scattering events that leave the electron back in the ground level and approximate otherwise , is also used to allow for angular diffusion .",
    "the  absorption \" approximation used to sample angular redistribution and to choose the target electrons initial momenta in the majority of scattering events is strictly valid as long as the resonant part of the cross section dominates .",
    "accuracy in the line core is warranted but not in the wings where the full scattering cross section provides a better description .",
    "each spectrum is formed by unbiased injection of fifty thousand individual photons from @xmath25 identical energy bands evenly distributed throughout the spectral range .",
    "this is followed by re - processing of each photon through scattering and subsequent collection of the escaping radiation in a similar energy grid . to avoid poor statistics at high energies ,",
    "photons are injected from a flat spectrum and are assigned spectral weights .",
    "two geometries for the scattering region are considered : plane parallel slab ( with the magnetic field parallel to the slab s normal vector ) and cylindrical ( with the field parallel to the cylinder axis ) .",
    "because of axial symmetry , the @xmath26 direction is oriented along the magnetic field * b*. a continuum photon spectrum is incident from a source at the slab midplane or from the cylinder axis . internally",
    ", the source code keeps track of @xmath27 equally spaced values of @xmath28 $ ] , the cosine of the viewing angle to the field , and of @xmath29 energy bins with @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the injected and escaping photons are accumulated into four ranges of @xmath31 $ ] , and angle - dependent spectra are formed by considering the number of emerging photons in each of the @xmath25 energy bins .",
    "the thomson optical depth of the plasma in the line forming region , the electron temperature and the spectral index of injected photons are prescribed .",
    "our primary motivation for investigating the effect of anisotropic continuum photon distributions on cyclotron line formation is the fact that almost all radiation processes in the strong magnetic fields of x - ray pulsars produce anisotropic radiation .",
    "such anisotropy results from the strong angle dependence of the magnetized cross sections for compton scattering and radiation rates for cyclotron and bremsstrahlung ( e.g. meszaros 1992 ) .",
    "a continuum spectrum resulting from inverse compton scattering would have a flux peak along the magnetic field direction , while for cyclotron emission from non - relativstic electrons the radiation peaks perpendicular to the field direction .",
    "in addition to the expected anisotropy of continuum radiation processes , the cyclotron scattering process itself produces anisotropies through angular redistribution . in ah99 , we found that isotropically injected photons scattering through a slab were preferentially beamed along the magnetic field direction normal to the slab .",
    "meanwhile , isotropically injected photons scattering through a cylinder were beamed across the field direction .",
    "thus , it is of intrinsic interest to explore the interplay between continuum anisotropy and scattering - produced anisotropy .",
    "since the opening angle for the injection is very small ( see eq [ [ eq : anginjform ] ] ) , the injection imitates the behavior of a @xmath32-function for injection at angles parallel and perpendicular to the * b*-field .",
    "the study of beamed injection in these two limiting cases will help to understand , interpret and ` de - convolve ' the linear coupling of the cyclotron line shapes to the anisotropies of the radiation field .    the essential features of cyclotron line formation in the high - field / low density regime were discussed in ah99 . in that paper we commented on the effect of increasing the magnetic field strength from @xmath33b@xmath34 to @xmath35b@xmath34 .",
    "because the nominal estimate of electron temperature scales directly with field strength , the features at near - critical fields generally become very broad . moreover , although there may have been some expectation that at large fields low harmonic features would resemble the fundamental line , this was not born out in our numerical results because the angular redistribution function is inherently different for photons at the fundamental cyclotron energy . at low fields ,",
    "@xmath36 cyclotron line features are ` absorption - like ' because the electrons prefer to de - excite in single perpendicular momentum quanta thus spawning photons just short of the fundamental cyclotron energy .",
    "the dynamics of line formation is thus most complicated at the fundamental energy . in hard continua",
    ", photon spawning produces very significant , broad line wings which distinguishes the fundamental feature from all others .",
    "all of the runs have a continuum optical depth @xmath37 .",
    "the incident photon number spectra depend on energy through a simple power - law @xmath38 the angular dependence of the injected spectra , @xmath39 , models three limiting cases : isotropic , cone beam ( where individual photons are injected along the magnetic field ) and fan beam ( with photons injected perpendicular to the * b*-field ) .",
    "we choose a lorentzian function for the probability distribution of angular injection of photons because it allows a simple implementation of the anisotropic injection process through monte carlo sampling .",
    "the functional form of the angular distribution is @xmath40 ^ 2 + 1 }                  \\right ) , \\label{eq : anginjform}\\ ] ] where : @xmath41 is the opening angle , or ` half - width ' of the cone or fan , and where @xmath42 is the center of the distribution : @xmath43 for the cone and @xmath44 for the fan distribution .",
    "as we have already emphasized , the angular dependence of the emerging photons in both geometries show noticeable departures from isotropy even when the injection is done isotropically ( examine the top graphs in figs .",
    "[ fig : angdistb.04c ] , [ fig : angdistb.04f ] , [ fig : angdistb.10c ] , [ fig : angdistb.10f ] , [ fig : angdistb.24c ] , and [ fig : angdistb.24f ] ) .",
    "the most plausible causes for this are the spatial bias induced by the geometry of the scattering region and the relativistic forward beaming of scattered photons in the direction of the intermediate electron s momentum @xmath45 ( i.e. parallel or anti - parallel to the * b*-field ) .",
    "as expected , slab geometries show the strongest anisotropy : the effect of forward scattering ( along the field ) added to the most favorable photon escape conditions at small angles to the field account for this result .    as a rough measure of anisotropy",
    "we define a benchmark ratio : the escaping photon number flux @ @xmath46 , to photon number flux @ @xmath47 , @xmath48 , with a super - index indicating the injection bias ( c for cone , f for fan and i for isotropic ) and a sub - index indicating geometry ( sl for slab and cy for cylinder ) .    for plane parallel slabs and isotropic injection at the lower field strengths ( b=.04 and @xmath37 ) , the ratio of photon number flux in the @xmath49 direction to the flux perpendicular to @xmath49 is @xmath50 . for the cylinder , this same ratio is @xmath51 and the radiation escapes preferentially in the direction of least optical depth ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the anisotropy of the escaping radiation increases with optical depth ( araya 1996 ) . for the slab ( @ b=.04 and @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 , but remains about the same for the cylinder , @xmath55 , since the depth in the parallel direction is already large for this geometry .    in larger fields ,",
    "the emerging photon anisotropy for slab remains about constant ( @xmath56 , b = 0.24 ) ; @xmath57 , and decreases slightly for the cylinder : @xmath58 .",
    "this may seem surprising at first : for @xmath59 and @xmath60 kev , one would expect stronger forward beaming from the mildly relativistic electrons of the plasma . however , the resonance profiles are stronger at lower fields ( ah99 ) . this seems to play a more dominant role in the angular biasing than does the relativistic forward beaming in this parameter space .",
    "let us examine next the effect of * beamed photon injection * ( all fluxes will now correspond to a continuum optical depth @xmath37 ) . for _ cone",
    "_ injection at the lower fields ( @xmath61 ) our benchmark ratios are ( fig.[fig : angdistb.04c ] ) : @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and for fan beam injection ( fig.[fig : angdistb.04f ] ) : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . clearly , cylinder geometries hinder large numbers of photons from emerging at small angles even if all the photons are injected there ( cone injection ) and the same can be said for spectra seen at large angles from slabs with fan beam injection .",
    "however an unexpected result is now apparent ; the scattering of photons injected perpendicular to the field tends to make these radiation field ratios more isotropic while the opposite happens for cone injection ( note that the benchmark ratios are a * rough * measure of isotropy ; for a better description refer to the figures for the exact angular dependence of the emergent radiation ) .",
    "if relativistic scattering along the field direction is the cause of this behavior , then this trend should be stronger for the higher fields .",
    "the ratios for parallel to perpendicular photon number flux at higher fields are : @xmath66 ( fig.[fig : angdistb.10c ] ) and @xmath67 ( fig.[fig : angdistb.24c ] ) , for cone injection and @xmath68 ( fig.[fig : angdistb.10f ] ) and @xmath69 ( fig.[fig : angdistb.24f ] ) , for fan injection thus , note that our conjecture regarding the effect of relativistic scattering proves to be wrong : fan beam injection at larger fields yield emerging spectra that are beamed along the perpendicular direction to the field , while the emerging radiation from cone injection is more isotropic !",
    "again we turn to the line profiles for an explanation .",
    "the fact that the total line profiles are higher at lower fields partially explains the observed behavior .",
    "moreover , one may now attempt to find further causes for the hindering of the relativistic beaming .",
    "as was pointed out by lamb et al ( 1989 ) for low fields in the non - relativistic limit , photons are removed from the incident spectrum at higher harmonic energies ( see the branching ratios in ah99 ) at rates @xmath70 and the spawned photon contribution is injected preferentially along the field @xmath71 .",
    "this trend for angular redistribution ( _ modulo _ relativistic corrections ) is borne out qualitatively in our low field models . in higher fields the higher harmonic photons",
    "are not removed from the spectrum but are redistributed with similar angular dependencies ( as derived from the cross sections in the rest - frame of the initial electron and in the ` @xmath72-frame ' of the intermediate electron ( see eqs : [ 57 ] and [ 59 ] of ah99 ) , due to the preference for @xmath73 scattering .",
    "the emergent spectra are shown in figs . 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 . because the spectra are constrained by limited statistics ,",
    "photon depletion at line center is unavoidable with the limited samples .",
    "crosses indicate parts of the spectrum where photon depletion has occurred .",
    "first , observe that in order to obtain an absorption dip for the first harmonic , the observer must see the spectra at an angle where injection has taken place : along the * b*-field for cone injection or perpendicular to * b * for fan injection .",
    "moreover , beginning with fig .",
    "[ [ fig : is.v.cob.04 ] ] , notice that by injecting the photons parallel to the field ( cone injection ) in a slab geometry , the broad line wings that occurred at small angles in the isotropic injection case disappear . instead , the feature at the fundamental resonant energy is absorption - like for small angles and at large angles it yields an emission line ! ( somewhat resembling the case of isotropic - injection in cylindrical - geometry ) .",
    "in addition note that for a cone injected slab the features at large angles are produced mostly by photons scattered out of small angles and that there is no replenishing of these photons , so that exaggerated features are expected .",
    "thus , _ the disappearance of the broad line wings for @xmath74 suggests that these are formed by angular redistribution from @xmath75_.    recall from our discussion above that these spectra ( cone injected slabs ) have _ strong _ beaming along the * b*-field . at lower fields the beaming is strongest . on the other hand , note that fan injected slabs at lower fields have the most isotropic emergent radiation field ; this fact should make their spectra easier to interpret .",
    "the line wings are strongest in this case",
    ". an absorption - like line can be seen now for large viewing angles ( i.e. the fundamental at @xmath76 ) .",
    "these two observations also suggest redistribution out of the injected pattern and into the solid angle space with less photon occupation relative to the continuum .",
    "the line wings for @xmath74 are exaggerated because the continuum is low there .",
    "alternatively , there is almost twice as much @xmath49 flux bias in the isotropic injection case and the line wings at small angles are less prominent .",
    "this lends further support to our proposal regarding the connection between angular redistribution and the formation of the line wings .    cone injected cylinders show strengthened signatures at the fundamental energy for @xmath77 , compared to the isotropically injected case ( fig.[fig : is.v.cob.04 ] ) .",
    "however , for small angles the line wings are depleted .",
    "redistribution out of the cone accounts for the weakening of the line wings in cylinders as well .",
    "fewer photons are scattered back into the small angles than are scattered out .",
    "the fan injected cylinders , fig.[fig : is.v.fab.04 ] , exhibit a reverse trend : line wings dominate except for @xmath75 where there is virtually no feature at the fundamental for @xmath78 = .04 .",
    "although this is noteworthy , it is very unique to the parameter space of that particular model .",
    "higher field plots show a general trend of broadening in all the lines due to the higher temperatures required for detailed balance of cyclotron cooling and heating rates ( lamb , wang , wasserman 1990 ) . for @xmath59 , the extremely broad line wings in the isotropic injection case overwhelm the continuum at small angles in slabs .",
    "again these wings completely go away when the photons are injected in a cone beam and an absorption - like line for @xmath75 appears as it did in lower fields .",
    "lastly , the higher field spectra exhibit a feature with strong asymmetry at the fundamental energy .",
    "this is a reflection of having _",
    "step_-like profiles at large angles due to the relativistic cut - off energy , in addition to lesser relative ratio between the profiles throughout the angle range .",
    "the profiles at lower fields show a ` cusp ' at this energy and thus , the profile changes rapidly on either side of the cut - off energy .",
    "the profile at higher fields shows no such cusp ; instead there is a sharp drop for energies beyond the relativistic cut off ( araya 1996 , araya & harding 1999 ) .",
    "this study has illustrated that the angular distribution of the incident radiation has important effects on the emergent cyclotron line spectra .",
    "there is a profound interplay between the incident photon angular distribution and the geometry of the scattering region . in general , the line features are most pronounced along the directions of the anisotropic continuum injection and tend to be weakened in other directions , relative to the line features resulting from an isotropic continuum injection .",
    "we find that the enhancements at the line wings of the fundamental , which appear prominantly in the case of isotropic continuum injection , are strongly suppressed along the direction of anisotropy in the case of beamed continuum injection , regardless of geometry or beaming pattern .",
    "the absence of line wings at the fundamental may thus be an indicator of non - isotropic continuum radiation .",
    "these trends are strong enough that phase resolved spectral studies of observed cyclotron line features of x - ray pulsars may be able to identify the continuum anisotropy orientation relative to the direction of maximum optical depth of the scattering region .",
    "it thus may be possible to obtain information about the continuum emission mechanism from the shapes of the observed cyclotron lines in these sources .",
