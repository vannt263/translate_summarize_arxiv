    "in many cases the influence of crystal imperfections present in any real material can be neglected in favour of the interactions dominating e.g. electron transport or optical properties . in some cases however , and especially at low temperatures , interesting physical effects arise from the specific physical processes induced by scattering on crystal defects .",
    "examples range from the quantum hall effect  an intricate problem far beyond the scope of our study  to electrical transport in polaronic systems .",
    "one prominent example is anderson s prediction that in a disordered material itinerant ( extended ) states can be turned into localised states which do not carry any current  @xcite .",
    "this transition from extended to localised states is a result of quantum interference arising from elastic scattering on impurities in a crystal .",
    "it leads , roughly speaking , to spatial confinement of an electron : the electron wave - function decays exponentially with distance .",
    "this peculiar , essentially quantum mechanical behaviour has motivated lots of research ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) . as yet , however , many important questions in the field of localisation physics have not been finally settled , and localisation in interacting systems is still far from being understood .",
    "progress on this topic requires new techniques which allow for a comprehensive  necessarily approximate , but reliable  description of disorder and interaction on a microscopic scale .",
    "one possible approach shall be discussed here .",
    "the focus of our study is on substitutionally disordered three - dimensional materials like doped semiconductors or alloys",
    ". we will not be concerned with amorphous materials like glasses which do not possess a crystal lattice ( but see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "then disorder primarily manifests through site - dependent local potentials @xmath0 .",
    "the motion of an electron in such a disordered crystal is described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath1 in a perfect crystal , i.e. @xmath2 , the electron hopping @xmath3 between nearest  neighbour sites @xmath4 gives rise to a band of width @xmath5 , e.g. on a cubic lattice @xmath6 , or @xmath7 on a bethe lattice with connectivity @xmath8 . in what follows ,",
    "we fix the bandwidth @xmath9 , and measure energies in units of @xmath5 .    to model the stochastic character of disorder the @xmath0 are considered as random variables with a given distribution .",
    "we demand that they are independently identically distributed with common distribution @xmath10 .",
    "for such a stochastic hamiltonian quantities like the ( retarded ) green s function @xmath11^{-1 } c^\\dagger_j |0 \\rangle$ ] are random variables in their own right .",
    "it is thus reasonable to ask for their distributions .",
    "this is especially true for the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath12 its distribution @xmath13 $ ] gives the statistics of the ldos in a disordered system , where translational symmetry is broken and @xmath14 varies with @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath13 $ ] does not depend on the site index @xmath15 : translational symmetry is restored on the level of distributions .",
    "it is important to realise that the site - dependence of the ldos constitutes an eminent aspect of a disordered system . for an extended state , for example",
    ", @xmath14 has a finite value on most lattice sites . for a localised state , in contrast",
    ", @xmath14 has exponentially small values on lattice sites outside a finite region , corresponding to the decay of the wave - function .",
    "@xmath13 $ ] will thus be different for extended and localised states .",
    "obviously the disorder averaged density of states ( dos ) @xmath16 \\ ; d\\rho_i \\;,\\ ] ] merely counting the number of states at a given energy @xmath17 , can not account for this signature .",
    "only for the ordered case @xmath18 , when translational symmetry implies that @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath15 , the distribution is entirely determined by the dos , @xmath13 = \\delta[\\rho_i-\\rho_\\mathrm{ave}(\\omega)]$ ] .",
    "as we will later see a similar characterisation does not even hold approximatively in a disordered system .",
    "the full distribution can be extremely broad for states in which the electron strongly scatters at impurities , catching the resulting deviations in @xmath19 .",
    "our goal is to obtain a calculational scheme for the distribution of the ldos for the models given by eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) .",
    "this scheme must account for the correlations that make up anderson localisation . at the same time it should be extendable to incorporate interactions .",
    "naturally this requires to employ approximations .",
    "it is important to guarantee that within these approximations the mutual influence of interaction and disorder at the microscopic scale is still represented ( which rules out e.g. the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , see below ) . a definite candidate",
    "to meet these demands is what we call the local distribution ( ld ) approach .",
    "it provides a self - consistent scheme for the distribution @xmath20 $ ] of the local green s function @xmath21 .",
    "we first describe this approach and its application to disordered systems , and later will combine it with a treatment of interaction .",
    "it is straightforward to construct the ld approach following the work of abou - chacra , anderson and thouless  @xcite .",
    "we briefly repeat their derivation which is carried out on a bethe lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ figbethe ] ) .",
    "the basic observation is the decomposition of the local green s function @xmath21 , @xmath22^{-1 } \\;.\\ ] ] the sum runs over the @xmath8 neighbours @xmath23 of @xmath15 , and the green s functions @xmath24 have to be calculated for the lattice after site @xmath15 is removed . for the ordered case we have @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "fig  [ figbethe ] ) , and eq .  ( [ gbethe ] ) is a quadratic equation for the green s function .",
    "especially we can read off the semi - circular dos @xmath26 of the bethe lattice  @xcite .",
    "now the stochastic viewpoint comes into play . for a disordered system , like @xmath0 all green s functions are stochastic quantities , i.e. random variables , and eq .",

    "hence they are identically distributed .",
    "furthermore no path connects the sites @xmath28 if @xmath15 is removed .",
    "this implies that the @xmath24 are independently distributed .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ gbethe ] ) can be regarded as a self - consistency equation which determines the distribution of one random variable , the local green s function @xmath21 , or equivalently @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution @xmath10 enters this equation as a parameter .",
    "such a stochastic self - consistency equation can be numerically solved by a monte - carlo procedure ( gibbs - sampling ) . to this end",
    "we represent the random variable @xmath21 through a sample of @xmath29 entries ( typically @xmath30 ) .",
    "each entry of the sample is repeatedly updated by a new value from eq .",
    "( [ gbethe ] ) , with @xmath8 values for @xmath24 randomly drawn from the sample and a randomly chosen @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath21 is finally constructed like a histogram by counting the number of entries in the sample with a specific value .    .",
    "when site @xmath15 is removed from the lattice the sites @xmath23 are in the same geometrical situation as site @xmath15 before , and no path connects them . ]      to put the ld approach in a more general context we will show how to construct it as an approximative scheme on others than the bethe lattice , thereby making contact to the cpa ( concerning cpa see e.g.  @xcite ) . on an arbitrary lattice the green s function can still be decomposed as @xmath31^{-1 } \\;.\\ ] ] in contrast to the bethe lattice the @xmath32 which appear in this decomposition do not correspond to the same geometrical situation as @xmath21 . if we iterated eq .",
    "( [ giidecomp ] ) we would thus end up with an infinite hierarchy of equations containing many different green s functions . as an immediate consequence the ld approach , relying on local green s functions , will provide only an approximative scheme on general lattices .",
    "a simple approximation is suggested by introducing @xmath33 which is the part of the @xmath8 hopping contributions in eq .",

    "to proceed further we write the local green s function with a self - energy like in the cpa @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ` bare ' propagator for the ordered system .",
    "in contrast to the cpa the self - energy @xmath38 is now site - dependent .",

    "note that the approximations we made are guaranteed to respect causality , in the sense that @xmath44 .",
    "( [ giisig ] ) and  ( [ giifromgjj ] ) are immediately seen to preserve this important property . for eq .",

    "if we increase @xmath8 the bare propagator @xmath37 changes , and therefore we shall scale @xmath3 as @xmath49 like in the limit of high dimension  @xcite . then , for @xmath50 , our scheme still reduces to the cpa , which is known to become exact for lattices with infinite connectivity  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the approximations we made are good for high - dimensional lattices .",
    "actually they turn out to be good for @xmath51 .",
    "it is commonly known that cpa is the best single - site approximation for disordered systems .",
    "the local green s function is obtained on average from an ` averaged ' effective medium .",
    "the ld approach solves the local problem exactly , while the hybridisation is calculated from a ` fluctuating ' effective medium .",
    "so to say , the ld approach is the best single - site approximation if fluctuations are taken into account .    on the bethe lattice",

    "( [ giifromgjj ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ gbethe ] ) for the bethe lattice .",
    "the key point is of course that , owing to the specific bethe lattice geometry , the non - diagonal contributions @xmath54 are zero , and the @xmath55 are indeed independently distributed . then our approximation scheme becomes exact : on the bethe lattice the best single - site approximation , with fluctuations , is an exact theory .",
    "note that for the bethe lattice @xmath8 is a free parameter : the ` free ' dos in absence of disorder is , for fixed @xmath5 , independent of @xmath8 , but choosing @xmath8 fixes the bethe lattice used . as the transfer of the ld approach to other lattices shows , going to the bethe lattice basically changes the ` free ' dos and introduces approximations to cubic lattices by neglecting correlations .",
    "the essential properties of disordered systems , e.g. localisation , will however be well described . for the time being we work on a @xmath56 bethe lattice .",
    "below we will discuss two models , the anderson model with a ` continuous ' probability distribution , and the binary alloy model with a ` discrete ' one .",
    "while the former is dominated by the anderson transition from extended to localised states , the latter is dominated by multiple electron scattering on clusters of atoms , visible e.g. in the fragmentation of the dos ( see below ) .      in the anderson model , with disorder strength @xmath57 , the @xmath0 have a box distribution @xmath58    $ ] of the ldos @xmath14 for the anderson model , in the band centre @xmath59 , with increasing @xmath60 .",

    "the distribution is rather gaussian , but becomes strongly asymmetric and extremely broad as @xmath60 increases . the ( averaged ) dos",
    "@xmath61 is not indicative of these distributions .",

    "here we employ the different behaviour of @xmath13 $ ] when the imaginary part @xmath64 in the energy argument of @xmath65 goes to zero : for extended ( localised ) states the distribution is stable ( instable ) for @xmath66 ( see fig",
    ".  [ andeta ] ) .",
    "this behaviour is again not caught by @xmath61 , which is finite for @xmath67 for both extended and localised states . but suitable moments of the distribution , like the geometric average , drop to zero just for localised states ( see inset in fig .  [ andeta ] ) .",
    "with this criterion which numerically tests whether the distribution is singular or not we can very precisely distinguish extended and localised states  @xcite .",

    "second , before complete localisation occurs , states towards the band centre are extended while states towards the band edges are localised , these states being separated by the so - called mobility edges .",

    "the b - band is rather smooth and almost reproduced by the cpa , which nevertheless misses important features . in the energy range of the a - atoms we do not find a band but a strongly fragmented set of peaks .",
    "each of these peaks can be attributed to a specific cluster of a - atoms , as indicated in the figure .",
    "due to the low concentration @xmath82 of a - atoms , and the large energy separation @xmath83 , states at these clusters do not hybridise and form a continuous band , but are essentially confined to the clusters and contribute discrete peaks to the dos .",
    "the cpa is by construction unable to identify those cluster states and therefore entirely misses band fragmentation . with increasing @xmath83",

    "we used the @xmath73  criterion to obtain the mobility edges for the lowest polaron sub - band in each of the two cases .",
    "the comparison to the mobility edges of the anderson model ( fig .",
    "[ ahm ] ) demonstrates that only in special cases the localisation properties of the polaron can be understood as the mere result of the mass renormalisation of the quasiparticle .",
    "are shown .",
    "the mobility edges are drawn relative to the sub - band position , and disorder is measured in units of the sub - band width @xmath117  @xcite . ]    for strong - coupling and large phonon - frequency @xmath110 ( circles in fig .",
    "[ ahm ] ) , the polaron in the lowest band is basically a heavy particle which moves fully coherent but within an extremely narrow band .",
    "it localises like a bare electron with a rescaled bandwidth , and the internal structure of the polaron does not play a role . due to the strong coupling",
    "the relevant energy scale for localisation has however changed by four orders of magnitude , making the polaron extremely susceptible to disorder .    for intermediate coupling and small phonon - frequency @xmath115 , @xmath112 ( squares in fig .",
    "[ ahm ] ) , the polaron motion is , already without disorder , different at the lower and upper band edge . at the lower band edge",
    "the polaron is rather mobile , while at the upper band edge it tends to be immobile .",
    "concerning the localisation properties the polaron at the lower band edge is thus almost unaffected by disorder and does not readily localise . at the upper band edge , in contrast , it is easily localised .",
    "note that the lowest polaron band is again coherent : localisation is not just affected by incoherent motion but intricately depends on the internal structure of the polaron .",
    "be also aware that disorder is measured in units of the renormalised band width : the polaron at the lower band edge is more difficult to localise than a bare electron only with respect to the relevant energy scale @xmath117 , i.e. the polaronic bandwidth .    in fig .",
    "[ ahm ] we have only shown data for moderate disorder , i.e. below @xmath68 when , for the bare electron , all states become localised . in the first ( strong - coupling ) case",
    "we can indeed localise all states in the lowest polaron band and obtain the respective @xmath68 which has the value of the bare electron renormalised by @xmath118 . here",
    "disorder induced mixing with excited polaron states is prevented by the large gap to the next band ( @xmath119 ) . in the second ( adiabatic intermediate - coupling ) case , however , with increasing disorder the lowest band merges with the next polaron band before it is completely localised . then the relevant energy scale for @xmath60 changes by one order of magnitude to the joint bandwidths of the two lowest bands .",
    "hence an equivalent to @xmath68 does not exist .",
    "apparently we can only draw parts of a phase diagram for polaron localisation . again",
    ", ep interaction changes the localisation properties in a more complicated way than thinking only in terms of mass renormalisation would suggest .",
    "in disordered systems green s functions emerge as stochastic , random quantities .",
    "it is reasonable to take this stochastic character serious and to incorporate distributions of those quantities in a description of disorder .",
    "following  @xcite the proposed ld approach is based on distributions of the local green s function . being exact on a bethe lattice , approximate on general lattices , it accounts for quantum interference leading to anderson localisation , and multiple scattering on clusters like in a binary alloy .",
    "the ld approach is an extension of the cpa including fluctuations .",
    "conversely , it contains the cpa in the limiting case when fluctuations are replaced by averages .",
    "we can then understand that the cpa results are good if  and only if  the distribution of the ldos is characterised by its average .",
    "this condition does not mean that the disorder is weak : even for small @xmath60 in the anderson model states at the band edges are localised , and beyond the scope of the cpa .",
    "a similar restriction exists for the minority band in the binary alloy model .",
    "the great challenge is however not disordered , but interacting disordered systems . here",
    "the ld approach can provide a description of the microscopic interplay between interaction and impurity scattering .",
    "locally , both interaction and impurity scattering are treated in the best approximation possible : dmft is the best single - site approximation to interaction ; and impurity scattering is exactly treated ( on general lattices at least locally exact ) .",
    "the ld approach depends on the accuracy of the dmft self - energy .",
    "a deep understanding of this part of the problem is important . how the involved numerical methods ( quantum monte - carlo , exact diagonalisation , density matrix renormalisation group , to mention a few ) or approximative schemes ( e.g. iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) ) used for the calculation of the dmft self - energy  @xcite cope with the considerable fluctuations in the local propagator @xmath120 induced by disorder is by no means clear ( e.g. the perturbative expansion in the ipt is best for weakly varying @xmath120 ) .",
    "since we largely understand the ld approach s application to disorder , how to guarantee for the quality of these methods is still the biggest problem  the computational costs for their implementation in the monte - carlo scheme notwithstanding . our results for",
    "the localisation of a single holstein polaron , where these objections are absent , demonstrate that the ld approach by itself allows for a comprehensive description and detailed study of interacting disordered systems .",
    "physically we learned how intricate and rich the interplay of interaction and localisation can be .",
    "future work will certainly support and extend this observation .",
