    "minimal supersymmetry standard model ( mssm ) is a way to extend the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "every particle is paired up with a super - partner with a different spin .",
    "one of the features of this model is that it can also automatically unify the the gauge - coupling constants in the energy scale @xmath3gev @xcite , as is required by grand unification theory ( gut ) .",
    "another way to extend the sm is to add extra copies of the @xmath4 multiplets . in order to construct an anomaly - free theory ,",
    "the simplest way is just to add extra sm generations @xcite .",
    "compared with the theories extended with chiral 4th generation , theories extended with vector - like ( vl ) generation is easier to survive among the experimental limits due to their particular vector - like mass parameters .",
    "mssm extended with vl generations have long been discussed @xcite . in order not to disturb the gauge coupling unification scale ,",
    "only copies of @xmath5 @xmath6 , or @xmath7 multiplets are the candidates to be added into the theory .",
    "up to one - loop level , one @xmath8 multiplet modifies the renormalization group ( rg ) @xmath1 functions of the gauge coupling constants three times the same as one @xmath9 multiplet .",
    "if we would like the vl particles to be of the mass @xmath10tev , and require the gauge couplings to meet with each other before they knock into landau pole , we can only choose @xmath11 copies of @xmath6 , where @xmath12 , or one @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the situation of 4 copies of @xmath6 theory , or @xmath2 theory is subtle .",
    "one - loop calculation unifies the gauge coupling constants with a value of 2 - 5 , which approaches the landau pole so much .",
    "two - loop corrections usually contribute a positive value to the gauge rg-@xmath1 functions , thus directly accelerate the gauge rg - trajectories to blow up before they meet .    in mssm",
    ", effective higgs mass receives extra loop contributions from the top / stop yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "higher order of stop mass raises the higgs mass while aggravates the tension of fine - tuning , and vl theories supply another source of the higgs mass . in this case",
    ", vl particles should directly couple with the sm - like higgs , and thus affect the higgs phenomenology @xcite .    as is well - known",
    ", mssm suffers from the @xmath13 problem , and adding vl generations can not solve this problem at all . the most economic way to solve",
    "this problem is to extend mssm into nmssm by adding a singlet ( s ) @xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the s naturally generates roughly @xmath14 , and the super - potential term @xmath15 can also add up to the higgs quartic couplings , thus raise up the higgs mass .",
    "if we extend the vl - mssm with a singlet s , just like the nmssm , we may take the advantages of both these theories .",
    "similar consequences have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "models with a scalar singlet and vl fermions without supersymmetry is also studied in @xcite . however , in our model , the vl - particles couple with s , so the vl - mass terms naturally come from the vev of the singlet higgs rather than being inputed `` by hand '' . by setting appropriate value to the yukawa constants near gut - scale , the mass - spectrum of the vl - fermions can be partly predicted .",
    "gauge coupling trajectories also receive extra contributions from the yukawa coupling constants , thus the unification can be improved by adjusting the values of the yukawa couplings in @xmath6 and @xmath7 models . in @xmath2 model ,",
    "extra yukawa coupling constants also contribute a non - ignorable minus value in two - loop gauge rg-@xmath1 functions , thus the gauge - coupling rg trajectories might meet before the perturbative theories lose effect .",
    "if we extend the ordinary @xmath0 nmssm theory , we should assign the vl super - fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath0 charges in order for them to be coupled with the s. these @xmath0 charges will also keep vl fermions massless before @xmath0 breaks .",
    "appropriate assignment will also forbid the vl particles to mix with the sm @xmath22 , @xmath23 fields , which is highly limited by experiments .",
    "the quantum numbers assigned to the vl particles are listed in table [ fields_quantum_number ] .",
    "however , only @xmath2 model involves all the fields listed in table [ fields_quantum_number ] . in our discussion about @xmath6 model and @xmath7 model , only part of the fields",
    "are needed .",
    "we should also note that all mssm quarks and leptons are ignored except that the effects of the top sectors are considered in our discussions due to their large yukawa coupling constant .",

    "fermions receive mass terms from @xmath28 , their masses are actually in the same quantity as @xmath28 in most cases . in nmssm , we usually concern about the @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and then @xmath31 . if @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which is usually applied for successful electro - weak symmetry breaking , we can derive that @xmath34 .",
    "collider bounds on vl quarks have been reviewed in @xcite , and the cms collaboration recently published their lower bound of vl top - like quark mass to a value of 687 - 782 gev @xcite , so in our discussions below , we assume all of our vl fermions lie in the mass scale 1tev , which is near the bound , although it is very easy to accumulate the vl mass towards @xmath35tev by lowering @xmath30 or raising @xmath29 .",
    "we also set 1tev as the turning point in our rg - trajectory calculations .",
    "the @xmath6 model is the simplest model .",
    "it only contains vector - like down - type right - handed quark and anti - quark , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , together with vector - like leptonic doublet @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "we can observe from ( [ 5p5w ] , [ 5p5v ] ) that only singlet higgs sectors are involved here .",
    "however , as to be discussed below , this still contribute to the sm - like higgs mass .",
    "the @xmath7 model contains vector - like quark doublets @xmath16 , @xmath17 , vector - like up - type quark singlets @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and vector - like electron singlet @xmath47 and @xmath48 . the yukawa coupling structure is richer than @xmath6 theory due to the appearance of higgs doublets . @xmath49",

    "the tree - level quartic coupling among higgs fields only comes from the gauge d - terms , so loop contributions irrelevant to the gauge terms should not be renormalized in order not to break the gauge invariance .",
    "however , in the case of nmssm , the appearance of @xmath15 also contribute to the higgs quartic coupling , and receives the quantum correction from the field - strength renormalization constant @xmath71 of s. we can then define @xmath72 , and replace @xmath30 with @xmath73 in the tree - level term @xmath74 , then we can also reach ( [ higgs_mass_55 ] ) .",

    "( [ m_sdl],[m_dl ] ) through ( [ cw_potential ] ) also contribute to the cp - even singlet higgs mass .",
    "expand the consequence up to @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 the two leading terms are similar to ( [ higgs_mass_55 ] ) , which result from the @xmath73 defined in the previous text , while the @xmath78 terms , especially the @xmath79 reflect the fact that the mass of the singlet higgs also receive the corrections from the mass hierarchy of the corresponding vector - like fermions and sfermions , which is q - independent .    to see the possible mass - spectrum of the vector - like fermions , we look into the rg trajectories of the coupling constants .",
    "we can learn from ( [ gauge_rg ] ) that gauge terms contribute negative values to all yukawa rg-@xmath1 functions , while the yukawa terms always contribute positive ones .",
    "@xmath38 is a sm gauge - singlet , so the lack of minus terms decides the quasi - fixing point of @xmath80 to be actually 0 .",

    "it is ever - known that the unification of gauge coupling constants is not that good even in the circumstance of supersymmetry , although it has been improved a lot when compared with the case of sm .",
    "if we want to adjust the yukawa couplings in order to drive the gauge couplings into unifying in mssm or nmssm , there does not left much room in the parameter space because we do not have many notable yukawa coupling constants to be adjusted , and the top yukawa @xmath89 affects on all @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , making it difficult to converge the intersection points . in our case , @xmath83 strongly influences the trajectory of @xmath92 however slightly modifies @xmath90 due to @xmath20 and @xmath21 s relatively small super - charge @xmath93 , and @xmath84 only effects on @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so we can move the intersection point separately by adjusting @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
