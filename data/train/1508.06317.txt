    "in 1992 , lucien hardy @xcite gave a new proof of nonlocality without inequalities for two particles that only requires a total of four dimensions in hilbert space .",
    "he further showed @xcite that this proof works for all pure entangled states of two two - state systems or qubits except for the maximally entangled state .",
    "hardy s proof @xcite ( which concerns two observables for each qubit ) was subsequently extended to the case in which there are @xmath2 available dichotomic observables per qubit@xmath3 for qubit @xmath4 and @xmath5 for qubit @xmath6 , where @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this latter proof as hardy s ladder test of nonlocality . in order to have a contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism in hardy s ladder scenario ,",
    "the observables @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are required to satisfy the following conditions @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the joint conditional probability of obtaining the result @xmath13 when measuring @xmath8 on qubit @xmath4 and obtaining the result @xmath14 when measuring @xmath9 on qubit @xmath6 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "according to a local realistic ( lr ) theory , fulfillment of the @xmath16 conditions in - necessarily implies that @xmath17 .",
    "quantum - mechanically , however , we can have @xmath18 while all the other conditions in - are satisfied .",
    "the success probability @xmath1 of hardy s nonlocality argument is sometimes known as the `` hardy fraction . ''",
    "it should be noted that the conditions - could not be satisfied strictly in practical experiments due to the difficulty of experimentally measuring a null event .",
    "indeed , _ even _ with perfect measurement apparatus it is not possible to achieve a true `` zero '' value for the various probabilities because the number of measurements in a real experiment is necessarily finite @xcite .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , to test experimentally hardy s conditions - , inequalities are necessary in order to make sure that the errors do not wash out the logical conundrum faced by local realism .",
    "one such suitable inequality for hardy s ladder test is the chained clauser - horne - shimony - holt - type ( chsh ) inequality @xcite @xmath19 which holds for any lr theory , with the correlation function @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the @xmath24 pairs of observables @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , occurring on the left - hand side of inequality are precisely those in eqs .  - .",
    "evidently , for @xmath30 , the inequality reduces to the original chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the maximum quantum violation of the chsh inequality is given by tsirelson s bound @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , wehner @xcite showed that the corresponding tsirelson bound for the chained chsh inequality is given by @xmath32    let us denote the sum of correlations on the left - hand side of either or as @xmath0 , that is , @xmath33    in this paper ( sec .",

    "should therefore comply with relation .",
    ", it will be verified that , in fact , the quantum predictions satisfy relation .",
    "] this relation was already obtained elsewhere for the simplest case @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it has also been derived independently ( for @xmath30 ) by xiang in ref .",
    "relation embodies the precise connection between , on the one hand , hardy s ladder test of nonlocality based on eqs .  - and , on the other hand , the test of nonlocality based on the generalized chsh inequality .",
    "an immediate implication of relation is that , when the hardy conditions - are fulfilled , the inequality is violated by an amount @xmath35 , or @xmath36 .",
    "it is important to note that this amount is four times bigger than that obtained for the chained version of the clauser - horne ( ch ) inequality @xcite @xmath37   \\overset{\\text{lr}}{\\leq } 0,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is the inequality commonly used in the experimental realizations of hardy s ladder test of nonlocality ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we will establish ( see eq . below ) the relationship between @xmath0 and the sum of probabilities on the left - hand side of the above ch - type inequality for the general case in which the probabilities are constrained only by the ns principle .",
    "the relation and its generalization are the main results of this paper .",
    "moreover , combining the relation and the tsirelson bound gives us the following upper limit for @xmath1 @xmath38 \\equiv l_k .\\ ] ] therefore , if quantum mechanics is correct , the hardy fraction has to be bounded above by the upper limit @xmath39 in eq .  .",
    "in particular , for the first five values of @xmath40 , from we obtain @xmath41    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we have plotted the upper limit @xmath39 for @xmath30 to @xmath42 . for comparison , we have also plotted the maximum success probability @xmath43 achieved by quantum mechanics . for a given @xmath40 , this latter probability is obtained by maximizing the function @xmath44 with respect to @xmath45 in the interval @xmath46 , where @xcite @xmath47 the asymptotic value of both @xmath39 and @xmath43 is @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the absolute maximum @xmath50 is realized for @xmath49 and a state that is close to maximally entangled ( @xmath51 ) @xcite . from relation",
    "it follows that , as @xmath52 , the @xmath0 expression approaches the algebraic limit @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , it is known @xcite that a generalized probabilistic theory ( gpt ) adhering to the ns principle allows for a maximum hardy s fraction equal to @xmath54 _ independently _ of the value of @xmath40 .",
