    "dna and rna are among the primary absorbers of uv light in all known organisms , stemming from the large absorption cross - section of the nucleobases which are part of dna and rna strands .",
    "absorption of uv light by the nucleobases leads to the formation of excited electronic states , which for this class of compounds mostly deactivate to the electronic ground state within a few ps @xcite .",
    "a very small fraction of excitations of nucleobases in dna leads to the formation of photochemical products called photolesions , which constitute damage to dna / rna and interferes with normal cellular processes . among the photolesions ,",
    "the dimerization of thymine to generate cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers is the most common one @xcite . because of this relevance",
    ", the photophysical and photochemical properties of thymine were studied intensively in the last decades .    among the most controversial aspects of thymine s excited - state dynamics",
    "is the importance of intersystem crossing ( isc ) .",
    "isc is the radiationless transition between states of different multiplicities , in particular from the initially populated singlet states to triplet states . due to the high reactivity and long lifetime of triplet states ,",
    "once formed , those states could be involved in the formation of photolesions like cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine 6 - 4 pyrimidone adducts , as was suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , other authors have argued that these photolesions are formed without the involvement of triplet states @xcite , or at least that triplet states only marginally contribute to these reactions @xcite . for these reasons , it is interesting to study the photophysics of thymine .",
    "besides studies in biological environments , also photophysical investigations in solution and in the gas phase are important here , since they allow separating the intrinsic dynamics of thymine from the effect of the surrounding .",
    "measurements in aqueous solutions find that isc yields are 0.004 @xcite to 0.006 @xcite , while in chloroform the yield is 0.08 @xcite . in acetonitrile the reported values range from 0.06 @xcite to 0.18 @xcite , suggesting that isc in thymine is solvent dependent and that less polar solvents enhance isc .",
    "more recently , much effort has been devoted to use time - resolved experimental methods to probe the ultrafast dynamics of thymine .",
    "gas phase pump - probe experiments are reported by several groups @xcite ; mostly a sub - ps and a few - ps ( 5 - 7 ps ) time constant were found , some groups also reported a ns time constant @xcite .",
    "in aqueous solution , hare et al .  have shown that thymine decays biexponentially with two time constants of 2.8 and 30 ps @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an assignment of the experimental time constants to either internal conversion or isc is difficult solely based on the experimental data and hence the last years have seen a large number of theoretical calculations on thymine .",
    "a number of authors have optimized excited - state minima and crossing points , as well as calculated various paths between these geometries @xcite .",
    "some authors have also investigated possible stationary pathways for intersystem crossing @xcite , showing that isc is feasible through several singlet - triplet crossing points along its relaxation pathway .",
    "furthermore , a number of non - adiabatic dynamics studies were performed @xcite , but none included the possibility of isc .",
    "thus , a logical next step in the investigation of intersystem crossing in thymine is to perform non - adiabatic dynamics simulations including singlet and triplet states with the possibility of isc .",
    "the sharc ( surface hopping including arbitrary couplings ) excited - state dynamics methodology @xcite is especially well suited for this application , and has already been used successfully for describing isc in other pyrimidine nucleobases @xcite .",
    "we performed non - adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations on thymine using the sharc methodology @xcite .",
    "the sharc method is an extension of tully s fewest switches surface hopping @xcite , allowing to include in the simulations of all kinds of electronic couplings between the states , in particular spin - orbit couplings which enable isc .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian matrix involving the singlet and triplet states of interest ( those states are eigenstates of the molecular coulomb hamiltonian , hence we denote these states as `` mch '' states , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) including spin - orbit matrix elements is diagonalized to obtain spin - mixed , fully adiabatic states ( called `` diagonal states '' in the following ) . the surface hopping procedure",
    "is then performed on these diagonal states , with the gradients and surface hopping probabilities in the diagonal basis obtained as described in ref .",
    "this methodology allows to treat internal conversion and isc on the same footing , giving a balanced description of all non - radiative processes .",
    "the dynamics simulations were based on sa(4 + 3)-casscf(12,9)/6 - 31 g * ( state - averaging over 4 singlets and 3 triplets , complete active space self - consistent field with an active space of 12 electrons in 9 orbitals ) calculations performed with molpro 2012 @xcite .",
    "the active space contained 8 @xmath6 orbitals and the lone pair of oxygen o@xmath7 ( ortho to the methyl group ) , while the lone pair of the other oxygen atom was excluded from the active space , since the @xmath8 states involving excitation from this orbital are very high in energy .",
    "the casscf method generally offers a good compromise between accuracy and performance , allowing to simulate an ensemble of sufficient size to sample the isc channel of the thymine dynamics .",
    "however , it is known that casscf does not describe all aspects of the excited - state potential energy surfaces ( pes ) of thymine correctly @xcite . in particular , casscf tends to significantly overestimate the energy of the @xmath9 state ( see table s1 in the supplementary information ( si ) ) , which not only affects the franck - condon region , but also the minimum @xcite and the corresponding conical intersections ; consequently , casscf will not be able to accurately describe the details of the @xmath9 deactivation . hence , here we will focus on the mechanism which brings about isc .",
    "an investigation of this mechanism is possible with the casscf method , since the vicinity of the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) minimum and the crossings with the two lowest triplet states @xmath5 and @xmath3 are described properly on casscf level of theory , as compared to more accurate caspt2 ( complete active space perturbation theory of 2nd order ) @xcite , as will be shown below ( see also the si for a comparison of the two levels of theory ) .",
    "even though our primary focus is on the isc mechanism of thymine , we simulated the full dynamics based on excitation to the bright states in the franck - condon region , in order to facilitate comparison with previous casscf dynamics studies on thymine @xcite and uracil @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for the dynamics simulations were sampled from a wigner distribution around the @xmath10 minimum geometry based on a frequency calculation at the ss - casscf(12,9)/6 - 31 g * level of theory .",
    "the initial excited state for each initial condition was determined stochastically , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on these initial conditions , an ensemble of 150 trajectories107 trajectories starting from @xmath11 and 43 from @xmath12was propagated for up to 2 ps ( less if a trajectory relaxed earlier to @xmath10 or @xmath5 ) with a timestep of 0.25 fs .",
    "gradients and non - adiabatic coupling vectors were computed for states which are closer than 0.02  a.u .  to the currently active state .",
    "we note that even though the dynamics simulations were performed in the basis of the diagonal states ( 4 singlets and 3@xmath133 triplets , giving 13 states in total ) , final analysis of the populations employed a transformation to the mch states , which are easier to interpret , since they have defined multiplicities . due to the large @xmath14 energy gap , during the simulations",
    "the @xmath1 is @xmath2 and @xmath11 is @xmath9 , so these labels can be used interchangeably .",
    "however , the two triplet states of @xmath15 and @xmath4 character often cross in the dynamics , so that there is no one - to - one correspondence to the states @xmath5 ( energetically lower triplet state ) and @xmath3 ( upper triplet state ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pop - t ] shows the time - dependent populations of the mch states averaged over the full ensemble as well as the curves resulting from a global fit , which will be described below .",
    "the figure shows that initially both the @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath16 ) are populated , but the @xmath12 ( @xmath16 ) is rapidly depopulated and does not play a significant role in the dynamics after about 200 fs . population transfer from @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) to @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) is much slower and consequently the @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) population reaches about 80% after a few fs .",
    "interestingly , the initial population transfer rate from @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) to @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) is quite large , and within 70 fs 20% of the total population reaches the @xmath1 .",
    "however , for later times the transfer rate becomes much smaller , and even after 2 ps almost 50% of the total population resides in the @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it appears that @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) population transfer might occur via two channels , where the faster channel is quickly closed as the dynamics proceeds . from @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) ,",
    "two relaxation pathways are available : relaxation to the @xmath10 and isc to the triplet manifold with subsequent relaxation to @xmath5 .",
    "based on the populations , isc seems to be the more competitive pathway , since within 2 ps the @xmath5 population increases to about 35% , while the @xmath10 population only reaches 5% ( 8 trajectories ) .",
    "these findings are qualitatively similar to our previous results on uracil , which also shows the mentioned two - step decay of the @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) and more isc than relaxation to the ground state @xcite .    in order to obtain rate constants for the population transfer in thymine ,",
    "a global fit procedure was performed .",
    "the global fit is based on the kinetic model shown in figure  [ fig : kinetic ] , including 6 species ( @xmath12 , fast @xmath11 , slow @xmath11 , @xmath1 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 ) and six time constants ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) ; see also the supplementary information for more details regarding the fitting procedure . since the populations of @xmath3 and @xmath24 are always very small ( on average , the sum of their populations is 2% ) , they were neglected in the global fit procedure ( but note that the @xmath3 is very important for the isc mechanism , just @xmath25 ic is extremely fast and hence @xmath3 does not acquire a sizeable population ) .",
    "a simpler model ( @xmath26 and @xmath23 ) was also tested but fails to describe the fast initial rise of the @xmath1 population , so that the more complex model with two paths from @xmath11 to @xmath1 had to be employed .",
    "the fitted time constants are given in figure  [ fig : kinetic ] , showing that @xmath27 has a time constant of 50 fs , @xmath28 has two time constants of 160 and 3800 fs , relaxation to @xmath10 has 5200 fs and isc has 900 fs .",
    "the time constant for @xmath19 ( 40 fs ) describes the rate with which the fast @xmath28 channel is quenched .",
    "the error estimates given in figure  [ fig : kinetic ] were obtained from bootstrap resampling of the ensemble populations and fitting the kinetic model to each resample @xcite .",
    "the employed kinetic model also can be beneficially used to fit the data from our previous simulations of uracil  @xcite ( see the si for the data and fit ) . compared to thymine , in uracil most time constants are slightly faster , with ground state relaxation being much faster at @xmath291500  fs .",
    "this difference is most likely due to the missing methyl group of uracil .",
    "focusing on the results for the singlet multiplicity first , we find that the kinetic model and the fitted time constants agree well with the time constants found in gas phase time - resolved photoelectron experiments , which usually report a fast component around 100 fs and another component of 5 - 7 ps @xcite . here",
    ", the fast component could be explained with the fast @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) channel , while the slow component is due to @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) @xmath17 @xmath10 which involves two steps .",
    "our simulations agree with other dynamics studies based on casscf calculations @xcite in the sense that the experimental few - ps time constant is explained by trapping in @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "different from the other studies , our simulations also predict a fast @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) relaxation channel , employed by approximately 20% of the population .",
    "however , it is well known that the casscf pes of thymine are qualitatively different from the pes obtained with other levels of theory ( e.g. , caspt2 @xcite , cc2 @xcite , dft @xcite , or om2/mrci @xcite ) hence , it is questionable whether the observed slow decay from the @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) state to the @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) state and the sequentiality of @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) @xmath17 @xmath10 are correct .",
    "recent ms - caspt2 studies @xcite indicate that a more accurate model for the relaxation of thymine within the singlet manifold involves a portion of the population decaying directly from @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) to @xmath10 ( via a ci involving a twist of the c@xmath30-c@xmath31 bond ) , while another portion crosses to the @xmath2 state and gets trapped .",
    "the finding that there is no trapping in the @xmath9 state has also been shown experimentally @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) population then decays on slower timescales to @xmath10 , most probably via a recrossing to @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) and relaxation along the same path as the fast decaying portion @xcite .",
    "the same model was also proposed for uracil @xcite .",
    "there exist some studies where the population trapped in the @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) minimum has been suggested to be the precursor for isc @xcite .",
    "ms - caspt2 calculations @xcite have shown that in the vicinity of the @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) minimum two triplet states are energetically close . in this region ,",
    "the @xmath5 state has @xmath4 character while the @xmath3 state has @xmath15 character and thus the @xmath3 pes is almost parallel to the @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) one ( see also figure  [ fig : liic ] ) .",
    "close to this region , the characters of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 interconvert due to a @xmath3/@xmath5 ( @xmath15/@xmath4 ) crossing . in the vicinity of this coupling region",
    ", also a crossing between @xmath3 ( here @xmath4 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) is located .",
    "these two crossings are hence close to the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) minimum and also to the @xmath15 minimum .",
    "the soc between @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is reported to be of considerable size ( 61 @xmath32 ) @xcite .",
    "this situation is well reproduced at our casscf level of theory , since usually states of @xmath8 character are less affected by the missing dynamical electronic correlation in this method and the @xmath4 state is fortuitously well - described in the surrounding of the @xmath33 minima .",
    "the soc in our simulations are also close to the ones reported in the literature @xcite , peaking at 58 @xmath32 with an average of 34 @xmath32 .",
    "( @xmath2 ) minimum ( empty circle ) to the @xmath1/@xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) minimum energy crossing point ( mxp ; circle with cross ) and linear extrapolation beyond this point . in ( a ) , the energies of @xmath2 , @xmath15 and @xmath4 along this scan on the dynamics level of theory ( casscf(12,9)/6 - 31 g * ) are shown , in ( b ) the same states at the ms - caspt2(12,9)/6 - 31 g * level of theory ( at the same geometries ) . in ( c ) , the corresponding bond lengths of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bonds are plotted . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : liic ] shows a linear interpolation in internal coordinates ( liic ) scan from the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) minimum to the @xmath1/@xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) minimum energy crossing point on the casscf(12,9)/6 - 31 g * level of theory used for the dynamics ( starting and end point of the interpolation scan are reported in the si ) .",
    "additionally , a liic scan carried out at the ms - caspt2(12,9)/6 - 31 g * level of theory ( using molcas 8.0 @xcite with an ipea shift of zero , an imaginary level shift of 0.3  a.u . , and the same number of states as in the casscf calculations ) is shown for comparison .",
    "the figure shows that indeed the pes at casscf and caspt2 level agree qualitatively with each other .",
    "hence , we are confident that casscf can describe isc from the @xmath2 minimum in a qualitatively correct way .",
    "the @xmath1/@xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) crossing shown in figure  [ fig : liic ] is responsible for the majority of isc events in the dynamics simulations .",
    "we firstly discuss these surface hops in terms of state characters and later on in the frame of mch states . out of 53 trajectories",
    "showing isc , 46 trajectories ( 87% ) showed a transition of @xmath37 type .",
    "the remaining trajectories showed @xmath38 transitions ( 4 times ) and isc from the @xmath9 state ( 3 times ) .",
    "hence , the results agree with the expectations from the el - sayed rule @xcite . the small number of @xmath38 transitions could be due to the small but non - negligible soc between these states , or due to mixing of @xmath15 and @xmath4 , which would enhance soc .",
    "when analyzing the isc transitions in terms of mch states , we found 13 @xmath23 hops , 37 @xmath39 hops , and 3 @xmath40 hops .",
    "thus , in most cases @xmath37 transitions involve as a first step a crossing of @xmath4 and @xmath15 ( so that @xmath4 temporarily becomes @xmath3 ) , followed by @xmath37 isc , followed by relaxation in the @xmath4 via a @xmath41 hop .",
    "the potential energy scans in figure  [ fig : liic ] visualize how the @xmath4 gets destabilized along the liic coordinate and first crosses with @xmath15 and then with @xmath2 .",
    "note that the fast relaxation via the @xmath41 crossing also explains why the @xmath3 population in figure  [ fig : pop - t ] never exceed 5% .",
    "thus , in summary it can be said that isc in thymine occurs close to the @xmath2 minimum at a three - state near - degeneracy region , but involves only the @xmath2 and @xmath4 states , whereas the @xmath15 state is mostly a spectator .",
    "other isc pathways proposed by serrano - prez et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , should play only a minor role in thymine . for the @xmath43 pathway ,",
    "the reported soc @xcite are only 8 @xmath32 and the crossing occurs far away from any potential energy minimum , thus allowing isc only for a limited amount of time .",
    "consequently , in our simulations we find only a very small number of isc hops originating from the @xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) state , as opposed to the larger number of isc hops from @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , our simulations also overestimate the lifetime of the @xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) state , and on caspt2 level the @xmath9 state is predicted to depopulate very quickly .",
    "hence , we suggest that isc in thymine does not originate from the @xmath9 , but from the @xmath2 state .",
    "the latter acts as the doorway state for isc , as suggested by hare et al @xcite .",
    "we note here that kunitski et al .",
    "@xcite reported gas phase experiments where they found a 3-exponential decay with time constants of 80@xmath4440 fs , 4.8@xmath442 ps and 280@xmath4430 ns for thymine .",
    "they concluded that the long lived dark state ( lifetime of hundreds of ns ) is of triplet character and that the 4.8 ps time constant is related to isc . this time constant agrees very well with our simulations ",
    "if one assumes a pathway via the `` slow '' @xmath11 , the triplet state is populated on a few - ps time scale ( 3800 + 900 fs ) .",
    "note that according to calculations of etinski et al .",
    "@xcite , this time scale is sensitive to vibrational excess energy , with a possible range of 9 to 770  ps for isc from a vibrationally cold @xmath1 state .",
    "interestingly , in our simulations @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xmath17 @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is more than 5 times as fast as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xmath17 @xmath10 , which would lead to an isc yield of about 0.85 , much larger than the experimentally measured values @xcite .",
    "there are several possible reasons for this discrepancy : ( 1 ) based on comparison with caspt2 calculations @xcite , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xmath17 @xmath10 is most probably too slow on casscf level .",
    "( 2 ) isc might actually be slower than predicted by casscf .",
    "the larger energy difference of the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) minimum and the @xmath1/@xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) crossing at caspt2 ( figure  [ fig : liic ] ( b ) ) compared to casscf ( figure  [ fig : liic ] ( a ) ) would agree with this thought .",
    "( 3 ) all experimental isc yields are measured in solution , while our simulations describe the gas phase situation . according to many authors , for thymine @xcite and similarly for uracil @xcite a more polar solvent destabilizes the @xmath2 state compared to @xmath9 , which could reduce the amount of population going through the @xmath2 as well as decrease its lifetime .",
    "note that for uracil ( essentially thymine without the methyl group ) , isc is strongly solvent - dependent , and varies from a few percent in water to about 50% in aprotic , less polar solvents @xcite .",
    "the gas phase can be seen as truely non - polar and an even higher isc yield could therefore be expected @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , experimental isc yields for the gas phase are not reported in the literature ( neither for uracil nor thymine ) , according to our knowledge .",
    "finally , we want to briefly describe the geometric changes seen in the dynamics .",
    "the transition from @xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) to @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) is mediated by two different types of crossings in our simulations , as shown by the clustering of the hopping geometries in figure  [ fig : scatter]a .",
    "note that these are the geometries where the trajectories hopped from @xmath11 to @xmath1 , and that these are not optimized minimum - energy crossing points .",
    "however , based on each hopping geometry , an optimization was performed ( using the standard algorithm of molpro@xcite ) , leading to either of the two geometries marked with `` x '' in figure  [ fig : scatter ] .",
    "these latter geometries are hence stationary points on the @xmath45 intersection seam , whereas the hopping geometries are simply geometries close to the seam .",
    "the majority of the @xmath28 hops ( 54 out of 77 ) were induced by a crossing whose geometry shows a relatively short c@xmath7o bond length ( atom numbering in panel b , optimized energy : 6.60  ev ) , depicted by the cluster in the lower right corner of figure  [ fig : scatter]a ; an exemplary geometry is also shown in panel e. since this crossing is relatively close to the franck - condon region ( middle of figure  [ fig : scatter]a and geometry in c ) , some trajectories arrive there early in the dynamics ( 28 trajectories ) , which is the reason for the fast @xmath28 channel shown in figure  [ fig : kinetic ] .",
    "the remaining trajectories miss the crossing and get trapped in the @xmath11 minimum with a long c@xmath7o bond ( upper right corner , geometry in d ) .",
    "trajectories leave the @xmath11 minimum slowly ( the slow relaxation channel ) and eventually decay to the @xmath1 , employing either the `` short c@xmath7o '' crossing or another @xmath46 crossing .",
    "the latter crossing shows rather long c@xmath7o bonds and small c@xmath30-c@xmath7o angles ( upper left corner in the figure , optimized energy : 6.30  ev ) , as well as out - of - plane motion of o@xmath7 ( `` oop - o@xmath7 '' ) , as can be seen in panel f. the `` oop - o@xmath7 '' crossing has been previously reported as `` @xmath47 '' by szymczak et al .",
    "@xcite , whereas the `` short c@xmath7o '' crossing was not reported so far in the literature , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the two optimized geometries are reported in the si .",
    "note , however , that  as mentioned before ",
    "the described crossings were obtained at casscf level , and that at ms - caspt2 the @xmath28 relaxation process might be different .",
    "after relaxation to the @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) minimum , a large fraction of the trajectories undergo isc .",
    "this process is mainly controlled by geometric parameters which strongly destabilize the @xmath4 state , as was shown in figure  [ fig : liic ] for the @xmath36 and @xmath35 bond lengths .",
    "a shortening of the @xmath36 bond for example increases the @xmath4 energy ( see figure  [ fig : liic ] ) , which may facilitate reaching the @xmath34 crossing .",
    "however , based on the trajectories it is not possible to single out an isolated mode of the molecule which is responsible for @xmath48 isc .",
    "the distribution of geometric parameters of all isc hopping geometries is not significantly different from the distribution of the same parameters over all trajectories moving in @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that several modes are strongly coupled in bringing about the @xmath34 crossing and hence isc .",
    "o and c@xmath30-c@xmath31 of an exemplary trajectory and moving averages ( 100  fs width ) .",
    "the shaded areas denote time intervals where the trajectory moved in @xmath11 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 , from left to right . ]",
    "it was noted for many trajectories that the state hops induce well observable variations to some vibrational modes .",
    "the most prominent of these `` indicator modes '' were the c@xmath7o and c@xmath30-c@xmath31 bond lengths .",
    "figure  [ fig : bonds ] shows for an exemplary trajectory the time dependence of these two bonds , together with the moving averages ( an average is taken over 50  fs before and 50  fs after the respective point in time in order to obtain smooth curves , which show the trend on this 100  fs time scale ) .",
    "the figure also indicates at which times a state - to - state transition in this trajectory occurred .",
    "as can be nicely seen , after excitation to the @xmath11 state the bond length moving averages quickly ( within 50  fs ) assume the bond lengths of the @xmath11 minimum geometry1.49    for @xmath49 and 1.35    for @xmath50 .",
    "at 1080  fs , when the trajectory relaxes to the @xmath1 state , the average bond lengths change , with @xmath49 becoming shorter ( the @xmath1 minimum bond length is 1.42   ) while @xmath50 increases ( minimum at 1.37   , the larger average in the figure could be explained by a strong excitation of the bond or anharmonicity ) . finally , after isc to @xmath5 ( minimum values : @xmath49=1.49   , @xmath50=1.22   ) again a significant change of the average bond lengths can be seen , especially for the c@xmath7o bond , which contracted notably .",
    "ab - initio non - adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations including singlet and triplet states using the sharc methodology have been performed to investigate the intersystem crossing mechanism of thymine .",
    "the simulations were based on casscf electronic structure calculations .",
    "it was found that after initial photoexcitation to the bright @xmath9 state the majority of trajectories spends considerable time in this state before relaxing to the @xmath2 . from the latter state ,",
    "the system relaxes slowly ( few ps time scale ) to the ground state , which agrees with the findings of previous casscf - based dynamics studies @xcite and yields excited - state lifetimes in agreement with gas - phase pump - probe spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "additionally , it was simulated for the first time that from the @xmath2 state efficient isc on a picosecond time scale occurs , bringing the system to the @xmath4 state . our simulations also show that other isc pathways described in the literature @xcite , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are not important in the dynamics .    in summary , our results provide evidence that the time - dependent treatment of the relaxation processes in the nucleobase thymine has to include the possibility of isc in order to fully cover the whole range of important interactions between the different electronic states . however , it is imperative for a more thorough understanding of thymine s excited - state dynamics that future simulations are based on more accurate electronic structure calculations than casscf .",
    "recent dynamics simulations @xcite on caspt2 level of theory are already a step in this direction , but more developments are needed until similar calculations can be carried out routinely .",

    "is used . in the right - most columns ,",
    "ms - caspt2 results are presented for comparison .",
    "the latter computations employed molcas 8.0 , a cas(12,9 ) , the 6 - 31 g * basis set , 4  singlet or 3  triplet states in the state - averaging ( sa over singlets and triplets in one calculation is not possible in molcas ) , an ipea shift of zero , and an imaginary level shift of 0.3  a.u .",
    "the same ms - caspt2 settings were also used for the liic scan presented in the main manuscript .",
    "note that both sets of calculations employed the same geometries , no reoptimization at ms - caspt2 level was performed . as can be seen , at the franck - condon geometry",
    ", casscf predicts all vertical excitation energies reasonably well , with the exception of the @xmath11 ( @xmath9 ) state , which is predicted 2  ev too high .",
    "also for the minimum geometries , the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath4 ) states are well reproduced , whereas the @xmath11 ( @xmath9 ) minimum is significantly too high in energy .",
    "furthermore , at caspt2 level the @xmath9 minimum has been located on the @xmath1 surface.@xcite    the crossing points in the singlet manifold do not agree well with each other .",
    "however , as the ms - caspt2 results do not show crossings at these particular geometries , only a proper optimization of the mecps at ms - caspt2 level would allow for a full comparison .",
    "still , the results clearly indicate that some details of the @xmath63 relaxation of thymine might not be well reproduced by our calculations .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath64 mecp is reasonably described by casscf , as can also be seen in figure  3 in the main manuscript .",
    "this fact , together with the qualitatively correct description of the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) minimum , indicates that intersystem crossing should be well described in our simulations .    .",
    "energies of critical points at casscf and ms - caspt2 levels of theory .",

    "the kinetic model used for the population fit is described by the following differential equation system : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the _ model functions _ of the respective kinetic species at time @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath73 s are the kinetic constants , where @xmath74 is the decay constant of @xmath66 , @xmath75 the conversion rate for @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the decay constant of @xmath78 to @xmath1 , @xmath79 is the decay constant of @xmath80 to @xmath1 , @xmath81 is the @xmath22 constant , and @xmath82 is the @xmath23 constant .    the differential equation system has been solved using the computer algebra system maxima 5.29.1 , yielding the analytical expressions of the six model functions @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the initial values are : @xmath83 in accordance with the initial distribution of the trajectories .    in a global fitting procedure ,",
    "using gnuplot with the marquardt - levenberg algorithm , the actual populations from the simulations were fitted to the model functions , as given below : @xmath84 where @xmath85 indicates a least - squares fit , where the constants @xmath86 are varied to minimize @xmath87 .    here , we want to note that according to this procedure , we do not divide the @xmath11 population in the trajectory simulations into subpopulations . @xmath78 and @xmath80 are simply two functions used to model the biexponential decay behaviour of the @xmath11 population .",
    "the actual reason for this behaviour could be that part of the @xmath11 population in our simulations directly moves from the franch - condon point to the @xmath46 crossing , whereas the remaining part of the population moves to the @xmath11 minimum and spends more time until it hits the crossing .",
    "as mentioned in the main manuscript , the biexponential kinetic model can also be utilized for fitting the excited - state populations of uracil , from our previous publication  @xcite .",
    "since we did not report such a fit in that paper , we present the fit here , in order to facilitate comparison with the new thymine results .",
    "the populations and time constants are shown in figure  [ fig : uracil ] .",
    "for comparison , in our previous publication  @xcite two time constants of 63  fs and 2.8  ps were reported , based on a biexponential fit of the sum of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 states .",
