    "the mean - field type of optimal stochastic control models deals with problems in which both the system dynamics and objective functional could involve the states as well as the _ expected values of the states_. the past few years have witnessed an increasing number of successful applications of the mean - field formulation , including mean - field type of stochastic control problems , in various fields of science , engineering , financial management , and economics . although the research in this direction has been well developed for continuous - time control problems , it lacks progress in both theoretical investigation and applications in discrete - time problems .",
    "the current work in this paper aims to employ the mean - field formulation to cope with seemingly non - tractable nonseparability in discrete - time portfolio selection problems .",
    "in particular , we revisit three challenging , yet practically important , portfolio selection models over a finite - time investment horizon ( see li and ng @xcite , costa and nabholz @xcite , zhu et al .",
    "@xcite ) , reformulate them as discrete - time linear - quadratic control problems of a mean - field type , and derive their optimal strategies with improved solution qualities .",
    "since markowitz @xcite published his seminal work on the mean - variance portfolio selection sixty years ago , the mean - risk portfolio selection framework has become one of the most significant ingredients in the modern financial theory .",
    "an important yet essential research theme under the mean - risk portfolio selection framework is to strike a balance between achieving a high mean of the investment return and minimizing the corresponding risk .",
    "if we adopt the variance of the terminal wealth as a risk measure for investment , we have the following mathematical formulations of the classical _ static _ mean - variance models , @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are equivalent to @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the wealth at time @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the portfolio strategy at time @xmath4 , @xmath6 is the random return at time @xmath4 , @xmath7 denotes the random terminal wealth @xmath8 from applying strategy @xmath9 in the market with initial wealth @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denotes the trade - off between the two conflicting objectives of maximizing expected return and minimizing the risk .",
    "the optimal portfolio strategy and solution scheme of @xmath12 can be found in merton @xcite when shorting is allowed and in markowitz @xcite when shorting is prohibited .",
    "however , the extension to a dynamic version of mean - variance portfolio selection was blocked for four decades until recently .",
    "let us consider the following abstract form for the dynamic mean - variance portfolio selection problem , @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the random terminal wealth @xmath15 from applying strategy @xmath16 in the market with initial wealth @xmath10 .",
    "due to the non - smoothing property of the variance term , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the information set available at time @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is not a standard stochastic control problem whose objective functional involves the wealth state as well as a nonlinear function of the expected wealth and , thus , does not satisfy the principle of optimality .",
    "therefore , all the traditional dynamic programming - based optimal stochastic control solution methods no longer apply .",
    "we now briefly summarize the main approaches in the current literature to overcome the difficulty resulted from the nonseparability . adopting an embedding scheme , li and ng @xcite and zhou and li @xcite considered the following family of auxiliary problems , @xmath22 , parameterized in parameter @xmath23 , @xmath24 note that problem @xmath22 is a separable linear - quadratic stochastic control ( lqsc ) formulation and can be thus solved analytically .",
    "li and ng @xcite and zhou and li @xcite derived the optimal policy to the primal nonseparable problem @xmath21 via identifying the optimal parameter @xmath23 and applying the optimal @xmath25 to @xmath22 .",
    "the embedding scheme has been also extended to multi - period mean - variance model with intertemporal restrictions ( see costa and nabholz @xcite ) , multi - period mean - variance model in a stochastic market whose evolution is governed by a markovian chain ( see elikyurt and zekici @xcite ) , a generalized mean - variance model with risk control over bankruptcy ( see zhu et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and dynamic mean - variance asset - liability management ( see leippold et al .",
    "@xcite , chiu and li @xcite , chen and yang @xcite ) .    by introducing an auxiliary variable @xmath26 and an equality constraint @xmath27 for the expected terminal wealth ,",
    "@xcite paved the road to study the following slightly modified , albeit equivalent , version of @xmath21 ( we omit the no - shorting constraint here and focus on the model itself ) , @xmath28 introducing a lagrangian multiplier @xmath23 and applying lagrangian relaxation to @xmath29 gives rise to the following lqsc problem , @xmath30 the optimal policy of @xmath29 can be obtained by maximizing the dual function @xmath31 over all lagrangian multiplier @xmath32 . in fact , the lagrangian problem @xmath33 can be further written as the following lqsc problem , @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "problem @xmath36 is a special mean - variance hedging problem , in which an investor hedges the target @xmath37 by his / her portfolio under a quadratic objective function .",
    "problem @xmath36 has been well studied and can be solved by lqsc theory ( see li et al .",
    "@xcite ) , martingale / convex duality theory ( see schweizer @xcite , xia and yan @xcite ) and sequential regression method ( see ern and kellsen @xcite ) .    in all the literature",
    "mentioned above , a static optimization procedure is always necessary to identify an optimal parameter in the parameterized auxiliary problem @xmath22 , @xmath33 or @xmath36 .",
    "actually , based on the pure geometric structure of @xmath21 , sun and wang @xcite proved that the optimal terminal wealth @xmath38 takes the following form , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the policy of the following particular mean - variance hedging problem , @xmath41 all the above approaches attempt to embed the `` nontractable '' nonseparable mean - variance portfolio selection problem into a family of tractable lqsc problems . although these transformations seem necessary , one meaningful yet challenging question emerges naturally : are we able to _ directly _ tackle the above nonseparable dynamic mean - variance problems ( without introducing an auxiliary problem ) ?",
    "the mean - variance problem is in fact a special case of the mean - field type problems where both the underlying dynamic system and the objective functional involve state processes as well as their expected values ( hence the name mean - field ) .",
    "this critical feature differentiates the mean - variance problem from standard stochastic control problems .",
    "the theory of the _ mean - field stochastic differential equation _ can be traced back to kac @xcite who presented the mckean - vlasov stochastic differential equation motivated by a stochastic toy model for the vlasov kinetic equation of plasma . since then",
    ", the research on related topics and their applications has become a notable and serious endeavor among researchers in applied probability and optimal stochastic controls , particularly in financial engineering .",
    "this new direction , however , requires new analytical tools and solution techniques .",
    "for instance , in a recent research on mean - field forward stochastic lq optimal control problems , yong @xcite introduced a system of two riccati equations to solve the problem .",
    "representative works in mean - field include , but not limited to , mckean @xcite , dawson @xcite , chan @xcite , buckdahn et al .",
    "@xcite , borkar and kumar @xcite , crisan and xiong @xcite , andersson and djehiche @xcite , buckdahn et al .",
    "@xcite , meyer - brandis et al .",
    "@xcite , nourian et al .",
    "@xcite and yong @xcite .",
    "despite active research efforts on mean - field in recent years , the topic of multi - period models in discrete - time remains a relatively unexplored subject where the mean - field modeling scheme has not yet been applied .    in this paper",
    ", we will develop a unified framework of mean - field formulations to investigate three multi - period mean - variance models in the literature : classical multi - period mean - variance model in li and ng @xcite , multi - period mean - variance model with intertemporal restrictions in costa and nabholz @xcite , and a generalized mean - variance model with risk control over bankruptcy in zhu et al .",
    "we demonstrate that the mean - field approach represents a new promising way in dealing with nonseparable stochastic control problems related to the mean - variance formulations and even improves solution quality of some existing results in the literature .",
