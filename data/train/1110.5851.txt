    "we produce analogous maps @xmath8 for @xmath9 , which we call the @xmath1-adic j - homomorphisms .",
    "the subscript of @xmath10 denotes passage to the universal cover ; this being necessary means that we do nt quite have a way of turning @xmath1-adic vector spaces into spheres , only almost .",
    "these @xmath1-adic j - homomorphisms are built in two pieces : an away - from-@xmath1 piece , based on the `` discrete models map '' for the complex j - homomorphism considered in works of may - quinn - ray - tornehave ( @xcite ) and snaith ( @xcite ) ; and an at-@xmath1 piece , based on a construction of bauer s in the context of @xmath1-compact groups ( @xcite ) .",

    "then adams showed that the real j - homomorphism produces a cyclic subgroup of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) of order the size of the denominator of the bernoulli number @xmath17 , and that ( in modern language ) these cyclic subgroups completely account for the first chromatic layer of @xmath11 at odd primes .",
    "we show that the @xmath1-adic j - homomorphisms have this same property .",
    "[ imj ] let @xmath16 .",
    "after completion at an odd prime @xmath18 , each @xmath19 for @xmath5 has the same image on @xmath20 , and this common image maps isomorphically to @xmath21 of the @xmath22-local sphere at @xmath18 .",
    "we prove this by producing a neutral candidate for the common image , then identifying it separately with each of the @xmath1-adic images , simultaneously showing that it maps isomorphically to @xmath23 .",

    "[ product ] the product over all @xmath5 of the composed maps @xmath24 canonically exists and is canonically trivial ( in the sense of appendix [ sum ] ) .",
    "this reduces to a topological statement , namely a certain refinement of brouwer degree theory for tori ( theorem [ tori ] ) .",
    "however , on @xmath0 it recovers a number - theoretic statement , namely hilbert s product formula for the quadratic norm residue symbols .",
    "indeed , for each @xmath5 the map @xmath25 is nontrivial , since it requires @xmath26 .",
    "but it can be proved either by shadowing the proof of theorem [ imj ] and making the necessary adjustments for @xmath26 , or by explicitly identifying @xmath27 ( [ tame ] ) with the legendre symbol through zolotarev s lemma .",

    "@xcite section 5.5  to the number field case . in this context , the unfinished paper @xcite of kapranov - smirnov was also a source of inspiration , having led to my considering the map @xmath44 ( section [ tame ] ) .",
    "finally , i am grateful to the nsf for their support through the grfp , and to the mit math department for providing an engaging , tolerant , and friendly workplace .",
    "we rely on the theory of @xmath45-categories as developed in lurie s books @xcite and @xcite . following those references , we call @xmath45-categories simply @xmath6-categories .    given an @xmath6-category @xmath46 and objects @xmath47 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath48 or just @xmath49 the space of morphisms from @xmath50 to @xmath51 in @xmath46 ; it can be viewed as an object in the @xmath6-category @xmath52 of spaces ( that is , homotopy types , or @xmath6-groupoids ) .",

    "when @xmath46 is a symmetric monoidal @xmath6-category , @xmath56 is an @xmath57-space ( `` abelian monoid up to coherent homotopy '' ) .",
    "let @xmath58 denote the @xmath6-category of spectra .",
    "we will often want to zoom in on certain phenomena in @xmath58 , ignoring others .",
    "formally , this can be accomplished by means of bousfield localization .",
    "we define a bousfield localization of spectra to be an exact accessible localization @xmath59 ( see @xcite section 5.5.4 ) .",
    "such an @xmath60 is uniquely determined by either of two full @xmath6-subcategories of @xmath58 : the essential image of @xmath60 , called the @xmath6-category of @xmath60-local spectra and denoted @xmath61 ( this is the zoomed - in category ) , or the kernel of @xmath60 , called the @xmath6-category of @xmath60-acyclic spectra ( this is the stuff we re ignoring when we zoom in ) .",
    "the @xmath6-category @xmath61 is the focus , but often it s the class of @xmath60-acyclic spectra that s easier to describe .",
    "the functor @xmath62 makes @xmath61 an idempotent object in the @xmath6-category of stable presentable @xmath6-categories ; in particular , @xmath61 carries a canonical symmetric monoidal structure ( given on objects by @xmath63 ) , and @xmath60 canonically promotes to a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath64 .",
    "see @xcite section 6.3.2 .    in bousfield s original paper @xcite on the subject , a convenient method for producing bousfield localizations is described : for any spectrum @xmath65 , there is a unique bousfield localization @xmath66 , called the bousfield localization at @xmath65 , for which the @xmath67-acyclic spectra are exactly those with vanishing @xmath65-homology .",
    "so the idea here is to zoom in on the phenomena which can be detected by the homology theory @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath68 $ ] is the @xmath69$]-moore spectrum for a set @xmath70 of primes , we denote @xmath71 by @xmath72 $ ] and call it @xmath70-inversion . taking homotopy groups @xmath73 intertwines this @xmath70-inversion functor with the analogous one @xmath74:=m\\otimes\\mathbb{z}[1/p]$ ] on abelian groups .",

    "when @xmath77 is the @xmath78-moore spectrum for a prime @xmath1 , we denote @xmath71 by @xmath79 and call it @xmath1-completion . on homotopy groups , there is a short exact sequence @xmath80 in particular , when restricted to spectra all of whose homotopy groups have @xmath1-torsion of finite exponent , taking homotopy groups intertwines this @xmath1-completion functor with the ( somewhat ) analogous one @xmath81 on abelian groups .",
    "we call the functor @xmath82 just completion , and we say @xmath50 is complete if the natural map @xmath83 is an equivalence .",
    "for instance , if @xmath50 has finite homotopy groups then @xmath50 is complete .",
    "the case @xmath84 of the first morava k - theory ( at an undenoted prime @xmath18 ) belongs to the chromatic theory , and is more subtle .",
    "the resulting localization @xmath85 can be gotten by first localizing at complex k - theory @xmath86 and then @xmath18-completing the result . practically speaking",
    ", @xmath85 serves to isolate and amplify `` chromatic level one '' ( adams - bott - toda ) periodicity phenomena in ( mod @xmath87 ) homotopy groups of spectra .",
    "see ravenel s orange book @xcite for further discussion .",
    "because of its close connection with periodicity , @xmath41-localization has some interesting features distinguishing it from inversion and @xmath1-completion . for instance , @xmath85 kills all bounded - above spectra , and in particular depends only on the connective cover of a spectrum ; but in fact an even stronger claim holds , as shown by bousfield ( @xcite ) : the functor @xmath88 factors canonically through the zeroth space functor @xmath89 from spectra to pointed spaces , via a functor from pointed spaces to @xmath90 called the bousfield - kuhn functor ( kuhn did the case of higher @xmath91 ) .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath92 be two bousfield localizations of spectra , and suppose that every @xmath60-acyclic spectrum is also @xmath92-acyclic .",
    "then @xmath92 canonically factors through @xmath60 , even symmetric monoidally , and we say that @xmath92 is a further localization of @xmath60 . for example , @xmath93-inversion is a further localization of @xmath70-inversion whenever @xmath94 ; also @xmath1-completion is a further localization of @xmath1-localization , and @xmath41-localization is a further localization of both @xmath86-localization and @xmath18-completion .",
    "another example is that bousfield localization at the eilenberg - maclane spectrum @xmath95 $ ] is a further localization of @xmath70-inversion .",
    "the resulting natural transformation @xmath96\\rightarrow l_{h\\mathbb{z}[1/p]}$ ] is an equivalence on bounded below spectra , and thus @xmath97}$ ] is often an acceptable substitute for @xmath70-inversion .",
    "the same remark applies to @xmath98 and @xmath1-completion .",
    "group completion is the homotopy - theoretic analog of the procedure of freely adjoining inverses to a monoid in order to obtain a group .",
    "we discuss it here in the `` weak abelian '' or `` @xmath57 '' setting .",
    "let @xmath99 be an @xmath57-space .",
    "iteratively applying the classifying space construction to @xmath99 produces a connective spectrum @xmath100 called the group completion of @xmath99 .",
    "the resulting functor @xmath101 from @xmath57-spaces to spectra is left adjoint to the functor sending a spectrum @xmath65 to its zeroth space @xmath102 with @xmath57-structure of loop multiplication .",
    "furthermore , these adjoint functors @xmath103 and @xmath89 restrict to an equivalence between group - like @xmath57-spaces  defined by the condition of @xmath104 being a group  and connective spectra .",
    "see segal s original article @xcite , @xcite section 3.5 , or @xcite section 5.1.3 for treatments of these ideas .",
    "let @xmath46 be a symmetric monoidal @xmath6-category .",
    "restricting to the invertible components of its @xmath57-space of objects @xmath56 ( [ infcat ] ) gives a group - like @xmath57-space @xmath105 .",
    ". this will indeed be the case in our examples , c.f .",
    "the following paragraphs . ]",
    "we denote the corresponding connective spectrum ( [ gp ] ) by @xmath106 , and call it the picard spectrum of @xmath46 .",
    "thus the zeroth homotopy group @xmath107 is the abelian group of equivalence classes of invertible objects of @xmath46 , and the higher homotopy groups can be accessed via the equivalence @xmath108 , the space of self - equivalences of the unit object @xmath109 in @xmath46 .",
    "most of our examples of interest are of the form @xmath110 for some bousfield localization @xmath60 of spectra ( [ loc ] ) . for information on @xmath111",
    "see the paper @xcite of hopkins , mahowald , and sadofsky ; as for the higher homotopy groups , we have @xmath112 the spectrum of units of the @xmath57-ring spectrum @xmath113 ( for which see @xcite ch .",
    "vi or @xcite ) ; thus @xmath114 identifies with the units of @xmath115 , and for @xmath116 we have @xmath117 by translating the unit of @xmath113 to zero .",
    "let @xmath118 be a unital associative ( discrete ) ring .",
    "we define the k - theory spectrum @xmath119 to be the group completion of the @xmath57-space @xmath120 of finitely generated projective ( left ) @xmath118-modules up to isomorphism under direct sum .",
    "this model for @xmath119 , given by segal in @xcite , is our primary one ; however , for some purposes ( such as understanding quillen s localization theorem ",
    "@xcite section 5 ) it is convenient to use a different model , based on the idea of group competing not with respect to the direct sum operation @xmath121 , but instead with respect to the multi - valued operation which says that @xmath122 is the sum of @xmath123 and @xmath124 whenever there s a short exact sequence @xmath125 in @xmath126 .",
    "this kind of multi - valued group completion can be encoded simplicially using waldhausen s @xmath43-construction ( @xcite ) ; we expose this in appendix [ sdot ] in a context that will be convenient for us .",
    "in this section , we introduce ( or rather recall ) the real j - homomorphism , and state a couple of its basic properties .    to every finite - dimensional real vector space we can associate an invertible spectrum , namely the suspension spectrum of its one - point compactification .",
    "this gives an @xmath57-map @xmath127 , direct sum going to smash product ; thus on group completion ( [ gp ] ) we get a map of spectra @xmath128 that we call the real j - homomorphism .",
    "here is a picture :     sends the @xmath4-vector space on the left to the sphere on the right . ]",
    "_ here is the relationship between @xmath37 and the stable real j - homomorphism as classically defined .",
    "since the one - point compactification functor on finite - dimensional real vector spaces @xmath129 is continuous for the euclidean topology on @xmath130 , we see that @xmath131 factors naturally through @xmath132 , this being the group completion of @xmath133 viewed as a topological category : @xmath134 on @xmath135-connected covers , the second map is equivalent to the classical stable real j - homomorphism @xmath136 from the infinite special orthogonal group to the infinite loop space of degree one self - maps of the sphere spectrum . thus our @xmath131 can be recovered from the classical one .",
    "but the converse is true as well , since on the one hand the map @xmath137 is an equivalence on completion ( [ compl ] ) by a result of suslin ( @xcite cor .",
    "4.7 ) , and on the other hand @xmath138 is complete by serre finiteness . + we will need the following trivial lemma concerning the behavior of @xmath131 on @xmath139 :    [ lowreal ] on @xmath139 , the map @xmath37 induces the identity @xmath140 ( i.e.  it sends the unit vector space @xmath4 to the one - sphere @xmath141 ) .    more seriously , we also need the following lemma concerning the map @xmath142 given by precomposing @xmath131 with the forgetful map @xmath143 .",
    "it is essentially part of sullivan s proof of the complex adams conjecture ( @xcite ) ; we include it here only in order for our proof of theorem [ imj ] to be self - contained in matters of @xmath144 .",
    "[ discreteadams ] let @xmath18 be any prime .",
    "then the composition @xmath145 of @xmath146 with the @xmath18-completion map is ( homotopy ) invariant under the action of @xmath147 on @xmath148 .",

    "the the pullback @xmath643 along the projection @xmath644 has a left adjoint @xmath645 , and the pullback @xmath646 along the inclusion @xmath647 of the point has a right adjoint @xmath648 which preserves all colimits .",
    "the composition @xmath649 is therefore a colimit - preserving functor from @xmath58 to itself .",
    "every such functor is equivalent to smashing with some fixed and uniquely specified spectrum , and here this spectrum is the desired @xmath618 .",
    "( this method of identifying @xmath618 , fundamental for our formalism here , was based on a suggestion of nick rozenblyum in a related context . )",
    "thus the association @xmath650 is reinterpreted as @xmath651 , the advantage being that now the desired multiplicative compatibility of @xmath611 in fiber sequences @xmath652 with @xmath538 a submersion can be seen as having its origin in a natural equivalence @xmath653 of functors associated to the pullback square @xmath654^{i}\\ar[d]^{p ' } & m\\ar[d]^{f } \\\\",
    "\\ast\\ar[r]^{e '' } & m '' } \\ ] ] of orbifolds .",
    "indeed , such an equivalence gives rise to an identification of the functor @xmath655 with the composition @xmath656 , and composition and smash product agree for colimit - preserving functors @xmath657 .",
    "an important point is that this equivalence @xmath653 does not need to be explicitly produced .",
    "in fact , the equivalence @xmath658 coming just from the commutativity of the above square formally determines a map @xmath659 ; this map turns out to be an equivalence , and its inverse again formally determines a map @xmath660 , and it is this precise map that is claimed to be an equivalence . by the same token , these equivalences also automatically satisfy a number of compatibilities , for instance bearing on what happens when one composes similar such squares horizontally or vertically .",
    "thus it turns out that the whole structure of the first mechanism for producing spheres already exists in the ( symmetric monoidal ) functoriality of the association @xmath661 ; to obtain theorem [ stacksphere ] one needs only verify that certain maps are invertible ( namely , we need invertibility of the functor @xmath655 as well as of the two natural transformations described in the above paragraph ) .    the second mechanism ( theorem [ algsphere ] ) is produced in exactly the same way starting from the theory of @xmath6-categories of modules over poincar duality algebras .",
    "furthermore , this categorical perspective also makes transparent the connection between the two mechanisms ( theorem [ unithm ] ) .",
    "indeed , there is a natural fully faithful embedding @xmath662 , coming from the fact that the spectrum of endomorphisms of the unit object of @xmath642 identifies with @xmath623 ; and while this embedding is not a priori compatible with the functors @xmath645 and @xmath648 , in the necessary cases it is compatible with their left adjoints , and these determine @xmath618 just as well .",
    "we will take a toposistic approach , so our orbifolds will be certain topoi . even though classical topoi suffice for this purpose , we will instead use @xmath6-topoi , because these more immediately connect to their @xmath6-categories of sheaves of spectra .",

    "the fact that the @xmath6-category @xmath608 of pointed orbifolds becomes an @xmath6-category with fibrations where the fibrations are the submsersions is clear from the definitions , so it s all about producing the map of spectra @xmath667 and checking what it does on pointed manifolds . for this",
    ", we will pass from orbifolds to their @xmath6-categories of sheaves of spectra .",
    "in the @xmath6-topos language , this is accomplished by means of the functor @xmath668 which assigns to each orbifold the stabilization ( c.f .",

    "6.3.2.15 ) that @xmath669 carries a canonical symmetric monoidal structure @xmath671 having the property that , for @xmath672 and @xmath673 in @xmath669 , the @xmath6-category of colimit preserving functors @xmath674 is equivalent to the @xmath6-category of functors @xmath675 which preserve colimits in each variable separately .",
    "this tensor structure @xmath671 on @xmath669 , used in @xcite to produce and develop the smash product of spectra , will be our main tool for defining the @xmath57-structures underlying theorems [ stacksphere ] and [ algsphere ] .",
    "we only discuss `` left '' , since `` right '' is just the same .",
    "suppose that @xmath538 is left adjointable with left adjoint @xmath544 , and ditto @xmath676 with left adjoint @xmath677 .",
    "then there are natural transformations @xmath678 and @xmath679 such that the compositions @xmath680 and @xmath681 are homotopic to the identity , and ditto for @xmath676 and @xmath677 .",
    "but all these functors preserve colimits , so the universal property of the tensor structure on @xmath669 implies that we can tensor these relations together , showing that @xmath682 is left adjoint to @xmath683 .",
    "thus a fortiori @xmath683 is left adjointable , as desired .    in just a second",
    "we will prove a strengthened replacement of this lemma ( proposition [ cohprop ] ) ; but first another definition , concerning how adjointable maps interact with commutative squares ( c.f .",
    "@xcite def .",
    "6.2.3.13 ) :    [ adjsq ] let @xmath684 be a map , parametrizing a diagram @xmath685 ^ -{g'}\\ar[d]^-{f ' } & \\mathcal{m}\\ar[d]^-{f}\\\\ \\mathcal{n'}\\ar[r]^-{g } & \\mathcal{n } } \\ ] ] in @xmath669 which commutes up to a specified homotopy @xmath686 .",
    "we say that @xmath539 is vertically left adjointable if @xmath538 and @xmath676 are left adjointable , say with left adjoints @xmath182 and @xmath687 respectively , and the canonical map @xmath688 given by @xmath689 is an equivalence .",
    "thus if @xmath539 is vertically left adjointable , we get a new commutative square in @xmath669 where the vertical maps are replaced by their left adjoints , and similarly for the three other variations .",
    "we caution that , for convenience , the modifiers `` vertically '' and `` horizontally '' will always refer to the manner in which the square is drawn on the page , and do nt necessarily correlate with the first and second coordinates of @xmath690 .",
    "now we turn to a refined version of lemma [ adjtens ] , asserting not only that passing to left adjoints of left adjointable maps is compatible with @xmath671 , but also that this passage can be made coherent with respect to both @xmath671 and composition in @xmath669 ( simultaneously , even ) .",
    "furthermore , this coherence needs to be encoded not just for morphisms in @xmath669 , but also for squares in @xmath669 as in definition [ adjsq ] .",
    "this may seem like an overwhelming amount of coherence data to specify , but the following definition ( an immediate analog of @xcite def .",
    "6.2.3.16 ) permits an efficient encoding .",

    "this is almost contained in @xcite ; it suffices to combine the material of @xcite section 6.2.3 with that of @xcite section 6.3 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath700 denote the fibrant simplicial colored operad defined as follows :    1 .",

    "note that , because of proposition [ cohprop ] and the idempotency of @xmath61 , everything in sections [ orb2shf ] and [ stackpf ] still goes through with this replacement , except that the map of spectra @xmath792 produced in section [ stackpf ] gets replaced by its composite with @xmath60 , i.e.@xmath841    in fact , since we will be in this bousfield - local setting for the rest of the appendix , let us remark once and for all that , although we do fix a localization @xmath60 for the purposes of discussion , every notion we consider commutes with further localization ( [ bousfact ] ) .",
    "for example , if an orbifold @xmath99 is @xmath60-compact ( definition [ lecpct ] ) and @xmath92 is a further localization of @xmath60 , then @xmath99 is also @xmath92-compact ; or again the @xmath92-dualizing sheaf of @xmath99 ( definition [ dualdef ] ) identifies with the @xmath92-localization of the @xmath60-dualizing sheaf of @xmath99 , etc .",
    "this will always follow immediately from proposition [ cohprop ] , since passage to a further localization @xmath92 is effectuated by tensoring with @xmath842 , and we will only ever use functors that preserve colimits .",
    "this same remark also applies to the previous section on poincar duality algebras .",
    "we start with some definitions and results related to compactness and duality .",
    "the eventual point will be that , in the compact case , we have a different access to the crucial functor @xmath655 : it is left adjointable , its left adjoint being gotten by composing the double left - adjoint of @xmath722 ( which exists in the compact case , as we ll see ) with @xmath843 . thus",
    ", under the extra hypothesis of compactness , we can let @xmath751 rest and make @xmath1 bear twice the burden .",
    "for instance , every compact manifold is an @xmath60-compact orbifold for all @xmath60 ( this follows from @xcite cor .  7.3.4.12 , which says that in the compact hausdorff case taking global sections preserves filtered colimits ) .",
    "another example is that , for a finite group @xmath521 , the orbifold @xmath844 is @xmath60-compact whenever @xmath60 is a further localization of @xmath845-inversion . indeed , when @xmath846 there is a `` norm '' map @xmath847 which is an equivalence after @xmath845-inversion .",
    "further examples can be generated from these by the fact that the product of two @xmath60-compact orbifolds is also @xmath60-compact , as follows from proposition [ cohprop ] and lemma [ shprod ] .",
    "[ adjproper ] let @xmath717 be an @xmath60-proper map of orbifolds , and @xmath718 a pullback of @xmath538 by some map @xmath719 .",

[ dualdef ]",
    "let @xmath717 be a submersion of orbifolds .",
    "we define the @xmath60-dualizing sheaf of @xmath538 to be @xmath856 with @xmath857 the unit , @xmath858 the diagonal , and @xmath859 the first projection .",
    "the second claim is local on @xmath99 , so we can reduce to two cases : one where @xmath538 is projection off some @xmath664 , and the other where @xmath538 is tale . in the second case",
    "@xmath867 is , locally on @xmath99 , equivalent to projection off a finite set ; thus @xmath868 , certainly invertible . in the first case , by lemma [ shprod ]",
    "we can assume that @xmath860 .",
    "but then the self - homeomorphism @xmath869 of @xmath870 fixes @xmath866 but transforms @xmath867 into @xmath871 , and so the argument of lemma [ mansph ] identifies @xmath872 with the constant sheaf on @xmath873 , which is also certainly invertible .",
    "an elaboration of the reasoning at the end of the above proof would show that , when @xmath99 is a topological manifold , @xmath861 identifies with the @xmath60-localization of the fiberwise `` one - point compactification '' of the tangent microbundle of @xmath99 .          applying the second claim of lemma [ adjproper ] to the pullback of @xmath848 by itself and evaluating the resulting right adjointed square on @xmath877",
    "gives @xmath878 so we conclude by the first claim of the previous lemma .",
    "we do nt yet have enough terminology to properly interpret the statement of theorem [ unithm ] ( we re missing the notions of an orbifold `` possessing @xmath60-unipotent duality '' and of a submersion of orbifolds `` being @xmath60-unipotent '' ) , but nevertheless we can still explain the first step of its proof using the above material .",
    "in fact , only the following corollary is necessary :    [ doubleleft ] let @xmath717 be a submersion between @xmath60-compact orbifolds , and let @xmath718 be a pullback of @xmath538 by a finite map @xmath729 .",
    "then the square @xmath731 ^ -{f'_\\natural } & sh(m)\\ar[l]_-{i'^*}\\ar[d]^-{f_\\natural } \\\\ sh(n ' ) & sh(n)\\ar[l]_-{i^ * } } \\ ] ] ( produced by the vertical left adjointability claim in lemma [ subadj ] ) is vertically left adjointable .    since @xmath99 is @xmath60-compact ,",
    "@xmath538 is @xmath60-proper in addition to being a submersion .",
    "then proposition [ dualprop ] lets us directly read off the left adjoint of @xmath724 as @xmath879 .",
    "similarly , @xmath821 is also left adjointable .",
    "now we give the first step of the proof of theorem [ unithm ] .",
    "it is a reinterpretation of the restriction of @xmath880 to the full @xmath6-subcategory with fibrations @xmath881 consisting of the @xmath60-compact pointed orbifolds .",
    "more properly , we give a reinterpretation of the smash - inverse @xmath882 restricted to @xmath883 , as follows .",
    "we start by exactly following the construction of @xmath884 ( given in section [ stackpf ] ) , replacing @xmath608 with @xmath883 and @xmath669 with @xmath809 , until the point where lemma [ doubleadj ] was used to pass to right adjoints in the @xmath274-direction of certain diagrams @xmath885 , thereby mapping @xmath886 .    at that point",
    "we instead use corollary [ doubleleft ] to pass again to left adjoints in the @xmath776-direction , thereby mapping @xmath887 to the @xmath57-space of objects in some full subcategory of @xmath888 .",
    "this makes the rest of the story left adjoint to what it was before ; and since for invertible maps left adjoints are the same as inverses , it has the effect of replacing @xmath884 by @xmath882 , as claimed .",
    "we can also make the same modification to the construction of @xmath889 , this time without restricting to any subcategory of @xmath810 .",
    "indeed , we need only check that for a pd - map @xmath812 of @xmath57-algebras in @xmath61 , the functor @xmath813 has a double left adjoint . but its left adjoint @xmath890 ( recall that @xmath820 denotes the @xmath123-dual of @xmath122 ) differs from its right adjoint @xmath891 by tensoring with the invertible @xmath122-module @xmath820 , so the double left adjoint is given by @xmath892 and does indeed exist , as claimed .",
    "thus for purposes of the proof of theorem [ unithm ] we can replace @xmath884 with @xmath882 and @xmath632 with @xmath893 , the constructions of these being changed as indicated above ( use double left adjoints on the fibrations instead of using one left adjoint on the fibrations and one right adjoint on the sections ) .",
    "the next step in the proof of theorem [ unithm ] will be to trim the fat off from the above construction of @xmath894 .",
    "the point is this : the @xmath6-categories of sheaves @xmath642 contain a lot of objects which are now irrelevant , in that they never arise if you start on the point and apply only those functors ( namely , pullbacks for arbitrary maps and the left and double left adjoints of pullbacks for @xmath60-proper submersions ) used in the above construction of @xmath882 .",
    "for instance , only locally constant sheaves now arise , so we could replace the @xmath6-categories @xmath642 by their full subcategories of locally constant sheaves and still obtain the same @xmath882 .",
    "but we can get by with an even smaller class of sheaves than this , the class of `` unipotent '' sheaves , provided we restrict to a further full subcategory of @xmath895 , namely that of @xmath60-compact orbifolds possessing @xmath60-unipotent duality ; and this is what we will do , in fact skipping right over the class of locally constant sheaves .",
    "| l | l | this class of sheaves on @xmath99 : & captures exactly : + all sheaves & the topology of @xmath99 + locally constant sheaves & the homotopy type of @xmath99 + unipotent sheaves ( of spectra ) & the @xmath57-algebra @xmath623 +      [ unidef ] let @xmath99 be an orbifold .",
    "we say that an @xmath851 is unipotent if it lies in the smallest full subcategory of @xmath642 which is stable , closed under colimits , and contains the unit @xmath109 .",
    "a warning : it is not clear whether in general this definition commutes with further bousfield localization , i.e.  whether when @xmath92 is a further localization of @xmath60 , the functor @xmath897 is fully faithful with essential image the unipotent subcategory of @xmath898 .",
    "however , this does hold when @xmath99 is @xmath60-compact , because then ( as we see in the subsequent lemma ) the right adjoint @xmath899 of @xmath900 preserves colimits , so the property of the unit map @xmath901 being an equivalence , and hence the property of full fidelity of @xmath900 , is preserved under tensor product ( by proposition [ cohprop ] ) .",
    "for this reason , we will only ever use definition [ unidef ] in the @xmath60-compact case , though probably a weaker hypothesis suffices .",
    "for the first claim , by passing to cofibers it suffices to show that @xmath903 implies @xmath904 for @xmath905 unipotent .",
    "so let @xmath906 with @xmath903 .",
    "then the @xmath61-enriched mapping object @xmath907 is zero for any @xmath908 , since it is zero for @xmath909 and the collection of @xmath910 for which it is zero is stable and closed under colimits .",
    "taking @xmath911 we conclude that @xmath912 and so @xmath904 , as desired .",
    "for the second claim , we note that @xmath913 , because @xmath914 .",
    "thus @xmath915 preserves colimits by @xmath60-compactness of @xmath99 . but @xmath739 detects equivalences on the image of @xmath899 by the above , so we deduce that @xmath899 also preserves colimits , as required .",
    "the second item of lemma [ cpctuni ] lets us identify the counit of @xmath921 with the tensor product of those of @xmath922 and @xmath923 , and since a left adjoint is fully faithful if and only if its counit is an equivalence , this verifies the full faithfulness claim .",
    "then for the essential image claim , since @xmath924 and @xmath925 are both generated by their units , so is @xmath926 ; thus the essential image is necessarily contained in @xmath917 .",
    "but on the other hand the essential image is indeed stable , has all colimits , and contains @xmath109 ; so the two must agree , as desired .              for example , if @xmath99 is a topological manifold which is parallelizable ( in the microbundle sense ) , then @xmath861 is a constant sphere , so @xmath99 possesses @xmath60-unipotent for any @xmath60 . for another example , if @xmath846 for a finite group @xmath521 , then there is a natural equivalence @xmath929 , so @xmath930 and thus ( trivially ) @xmath99 also possesses @xmath60-unipotent duality for any @xmath60 .",
    "further examples can be produced from these by taking products , since lemma [ shprod ] and proposition [ cohprop ] imply that @xmath931 identifies with the exterior smash product of @xmath861 and @xmath932 .",

    "[ unidouble ] let @xmath717 be an @xmath60-unipotent submersion between @xmath60-compact orbifolds with @xmath60-unipotent duality .",
    "then the functor @xmath724 and its left adjoint @xmath933 ( [ doubleleft ] ) both preserve the class of unipotent sheaves .",
    "the claim about @xmath724 follows immediately from the unipotency of @xmath538 . as for @xmath933 , since it differs from @xmath723 by smashing with @xmath876 ( [ dualprop ] ) , it suffices to show that @xmath876 is unipotent .",
    "however , by functoriality of @xmath934 under composition we have that @xmath935 identifies with @xmath936 , which further identifies with @xmath937 ; thus @xmath938 is indeed unipotent by the unipotency hypotheses on @xmath99 and @xmath732 , as required .",
    "it is a further reinterpretation of @xmath894 , or rather of its restriction to @xmath939 , where @xmath638 is the @xmath6-category with fibrations consisting of the @xmath60-compact orbifolds possessing @xmath60-unipotent duality , with fibrations the @xmath60-unipotent submersions .",
    "( it is clear from the definitions that @xmath638 is indeed an @xmath6-category with fibrations ; incidentally , this is the first claim of theorem [ unithm ] . )",
    "this reinterpretation is obtained as follows : we exactly replicate the construction of @xmath882 given in the first step of the proof of theorem [ unithm ] ( see section [ firststep ] ) , except that we replace the @xmath6-categories @xmath773 of sheaves by their full subcategories @xmath940 of unipotent sheaves .",
    "all the required formal properties for the construction are still satisfied with this replacement : corollary [ uniprod ] gives the symmetric monoidal functoriality of @xmath941 , and lemma [ unidouble ] immediately implies that lemmas [ subadj ] and [ doubleleft ] ( on left adjointability and double - left adjointability of pullbacks by submersions ) hold just as well with @xmath940 replacing @xmath773 once we re in the @xmath60-unipotent case .    on the other hand",
    ", the construction for @xmath940 sits inside the construction for @xmath773 the whole way along via the inclusion @xmath920 ; and since in the last step of the construction we restrict to sheaves on a point , where @xmath900 is an equivalence , the two constructions do produce equivalent maps @xmath942 , as claimed .",
    "this concludes the second step of the proof , which , to summarize , shows that @xmath942 comes from the symmetric monoidal functor @xmath941 in the same way that @xmath943 was shown to come from the symmetric monoidal functor @xmath944 at the end of section [ firststep ] .",
