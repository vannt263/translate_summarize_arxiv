    "problem of the response of materials used in electronics to large external fields is important from both a theoretical and a practical point of view . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the basic ideas of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics were developed over 40 years ago  @xcite , but the formalism has not been applied to strongly correlated materials except in approximate ways . it is interesting to determine exact results for electronic systems in an external field which can be used to benchmark these approximate techniques . on the practical side , it is often the nonlinear behavior of the material or device that determines the ultimate performance within electronics .",
    "for example , the nonlinear current - voltage characteristic of a @xmath0-@xmath1 junction is critical for semiconductor - based switching and digital logic , while the nonlinear current - voltage characteristic of a nonhysteretic josephson junction allows for digital logic based on rapid single flux quantum ( rsfq ) ideas  @xcite .",
    "a `` smart '' material is a material that can have its properties altered by changing an external system variable like pressure , temperature , or a gate voltage .",
    "the most common devices with tunability are currently based on semiconductors or ferroelectrics , but there is increasing interest in strongly correlated materials near the metal - insulator transition , because they might allow for more tunability than their semiconducting counterparts .",
    "the interest in large electric fields arises as the system dimensions shrink onto the nanoscale . when a feature size is on the order of @xmath2  nm , a potential difference of @xmath3  v produces an electric field of @xmath4  v / cm over the feature area .",
    "in addition , the military is interested in the robustness of devices to large pulsed fields that can arise from natural sources like lightning , or from man - made sources like those employed in electronic warfare .",
    "these high energy - density short - time pulsed fields may be difficult to filter out of a device and can cause the device to `` burn out '' .",
    "a `` smart material '' tuned to lie close to the metal - insulator transition is called a strongly correlated material .",
    "the name arises from the fact that one needs to take into account the electron - electron repulsion in determining how the material responds to external perturbations . in conventional metals ,",
    "insulator , and semiconductors , it is adequate to ignore the mutual electron - electron repulsion , and treat all of the electrons as independent , moving in an average field created by the other electrons .",
    "this is the regime where band - theory holds .",
    "but as the electron - electron interactions are made stronger relative to the kinetic energy of the electrons , then the electron correlations need to be taken into account , implying that one can not treat the other electrons in an averaged way , but one needs to take into account where the electrons are and how they move as every other electron moves .",
    "this is the regime of strong electron correlations , and as the correlations are increased , many materials will undergo a metal - insulator transition called the mott - hubbard transition .",
    "the simplest model which takes into account strong electron - electron correlations is the falicov - kimball model @xcite .",
    "this model has two kinds of electrons , itinerant electrons and localized electrons .",
    "they interact by a coulomb repulsion when they both occupy the same unit cell of the lattice .",
    "if the number of itinerant electrons plus the number of localized electrons is equal to the number of lattice sites , then the system will undergo a metal - insulator transition as the coulomb repulsion is increased .",
    "this model is not appropriate to describe many real materials , but its simplicity allows for many exact results to be calculated which are vitally important for benchmarking purposes .",
    "we consider the falicov - kimball ( fk ) model in the presence of an external electric field that is spatially uniform , but can be time - dependent , and can have an arbitrarily large amplitude .",
    "the fk model has two kinds of electrons : itinerant electrons with creation and annihilation operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 for conduction electrons at site @xmath7 and localized electrons with the corresponding operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the fk hamiltonian is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the nearest - neighbor hopping matrix , @xmath12 is the on - site repulsion between @xmath13 and @xmath14 electrons , @xmath15 is the chemical potential of the conduction electrons and @xmath16 is the site energy for the localized electrons . in the simplest case , we ignore the spin of the electrons and assume they are spinless . in the calculations presented here , we set @xmath17 , @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 ; this case is called half filling .    the electric field @xmath20 is described by a vector potential @xmath21 in the landau gauge where the scalar potential vanishes : @xmath22 we assume that the vector potential @xmath21 is smooth enough in space , that the magnetic field produced by @xmath21 can be neglected .",
    "the electric field is introduced into the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) by the so - called peierls substitution @xcite where we neglect interband transitions because we are considering only a single band ( the possible dipole transition from a localized electron state to a conduction electron state is also neglected ; this assumption may break down if the localized particles are electrons , but it can not break down if they are ions as in a binary alloy interpretation of the fk model ) : @xmath23 .\\ ] ] the peierls substitution represents the effect of the line integral of the vector potential on the hopping between sites @xmath7 ( at position @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( at position @xmath26 ) ; in this work @xmath27 only for nearest - neighbor sites @xmath7 and @xmath25 .    for simplicity we shall study the case of a @xmath28-dimensional hypercubic lattice in the limit of large spatial dimensions @xmath29 . in this limit ,",
    "the electron self - energy becomes local , which simplifies both the formalism and the numerical calculations .",
    "this approximation corresponds to the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) limit @xcite .",
    "the simplest electric field is one that lies along the unit cell diagonal @xcite : @xmath30 after the peierls substitution , the `` band - structure '' in the electric field becomes @xmath31\\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath32 the lattice spacing which we will take to be one . with our choice for the electric field along the diagonal , this becomes @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being generalized energy functions and @xmath36 is a renormalized hopping parameter : @xmath37 in the limit @xmath38  @xcite ; @xmath39 will be used as our energy unit .",
    "we find that many quantities we want to determine involve a summation over momenta of functions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these summations can be performed more easily by determining a joint density of states for the two energies in eqs .",
    "( [ eps ] ) and ( [ bareps ] ) ; the result in the limit of the infinite dimensions  @xcite becomes : @xmath42 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , a summation over an infinite - dimensional brillouin zone can be re - expressed as a two - dimensional gaussian integral .    in order to solve the many - body problem , we need to determine the electronic green s functions in the presence of the electric field .",
    "the derivation of formulas for these green s functions is more complicated than in the absence of a field , because there is no time - translation invariance , so the green s functions depend on two different time arguments .",
    "furthermore , since the system evolves in the presence of an electric field , there is no simple way to relate the quantum - mechanical state at large times to the state at small times .",
    "hence , we evolve the system forward in time , then we de - evolve it backwards in time , in order to properly determine its complete time evolution .",
    "since the local @xmath14-electron number is conserved , and we are not coupling the @xmath14 electrons to the field , the hamiltonian is a quadratic function of the conduction electron operators .",
    "this means the time - ordered product can be directly evaluated , and relevant functional derivatives can be taken to determine the green s functions .",
    "the algebra is somewhat long and will be omitted here .",
    "the end result is a series of equations for the so - called local contour - ordered green s function , which is defined with two time arguments , each one lying on the kadanoff - baym contour ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ) : @xmath43 , with the time - ordering taking place along the contour , the time dependence of the fermionic operators being determined by the total ( time - dependent ) hamiltonian in the heisenberg picture , and the angular brackets denoting a weighted trace over all states @xmath44 ; the partition function is @xmath45 with @xmath46 the inverse temperature .",
    "in addition , we need to define a local self - energy @xmath47 and an effective dynamical mean - field @xmath48 in analogy with the equilibrium case in zero electric field  @xcite : @xmath49^{-1}(t , t ' ) \\label{gf2set}\\ ] ] @xmath50 @xmath51[g_{imp}^{c-1}[\\mu]-\\lambda^{c}]^{-1}(t , t')\\nonumber\\\\ & + & w_{1}[g_{imp}^{c-1}[\\mu\\rightarrow\\mu -u]-\\lambda^{c}]^{-1}(t , t ' ) \\label{gc3set}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the noninteracting green s function in the presence of the electric field  @xcite , @xmath54 is the impurity green s function in zero field , which is equal to @xmath53 at @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the occupancy of the @xmath14-electrons [ @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the difference of this system of equations from the real - frequency case is that these objects are all continuous square matrix operators of time ( defined on the kadanoff - baym time contour ) rather than being scalar functions of frequency .",
    "the inverses are all to be interpreted as matrix inverses",
    ".    we will be interested in the so - called lesser green s function @xmath58 and self - energy @xmath59 in this work .",
    "these functions are extracted from the contour - ordered objects by fixing the first time argument @xmath60 to lie on the upper real - time piece of the kadanoff - baym contour and the second time argument @xmath61 to lie on the lower real - time piece of the kadanoff - baym contour .",
    "the system of the equations ( [ gf2set])([sigmaset ] ) can be solved by iteration starting from some initial guess for the self - energy @xmath47 . from eq .",
    "( [ gf2set ] ) , one can find the local green s function @xmath62 , which allows us to find the effective dynamical mean field @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( [ lambdaset ] ) . then the impurity equation [ eq .  ( [ gc3set ] ) ] allows us to find a new local green s function , which is employed to find a new self - energy from eq .",
    "( [ sigmaset ] ) .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the self - energy has converged to a fixed point .",
    "we call this iterative solution approach the dmft algorithm .",
    "= 2.8 in    once the system of equations in eqs .",
    "( [ gf2set])([sigmaset ] ) is solved , then we can determine the properties of the system as a function of time .",
    "it is convenient to describe response functions like the self - energy and the green s function with the relative @xmath63 and the average @xmath64 time variables ( the so - called wigner coordinates  @xcite ) : @xmath65 instead of the two times @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in equilibrium , these functions are independent of the average time @xmath64 , and depend only on the relative time @xmath63 .",
    "we perform a fourier transform of the relative time to a real frequency , and examine the green s function and self - energy as functions of frequency . in the nonequilibrium case",
    ", we do a similar thing , performing the fourier transform with respect to the relative time , and examining how the response functions evolve as a function of the average time .",
    "for example , we have @xmath66 note that we must have the first time argument @xmath67 lying on the upper branch and the second time argument @xmath68 lying on the lower branch of the kadanoff - baym contour .",
    "another interesting quantity is the current density that is driven by the external electric field : @xmath69 with each vector component identical when the electric field lies along the diagonal .",
    "the magnitude of the total current density in the case where the electric field lies along the unit - cell diagonal is then @xmath70    it is well known that the current response to an electric field is strange for a perfect conductor that has no electron scattering .",
    "indeed , there is an @xmath71 response to a @xmath72 field due to the lattice periodicity , which does not allow the momentum of the electron to get too large before an umklapp scattering event occurs with the lattice and changes the sign of the momentum .",
    "this phenomenon is called a bloch oscillation  @xcite , and it should be seen in any material that is free enough of defects and other sources of scattering .",
    "no conventional metal has ever been grown that has small enough scattering to exhibit bloch oscillations .",
    "instead , the scattering occurs so rapidly , that the steady - state current is a constant , which increases linearly with the electric field until nonlinear effects take over .",
    "bloch oscillations have been seen in semiconducting heterostructures  @xcite    bloch oscillations are also seen in dmft , with a time - independent electric field ( @xmath73 constant and @xmath74 )  @xcite : @xmath75 producing an oscillating current density [ @xmath76 is the noninteracting density of states , which is equal to the integral of @xmath77 over @xmath41 and @xmath78 is the fermi - dirac distribution ] .",
    "the frequency of the oscillation is @xmath79 and is called the bloch oscillation frequency .",
    "we expect these oscillations to survive in the presence of scattering if the field is large enough that the relaxation time due to scattering is significantly larger than the bloch oscillation period .",
    "the frequency of oscillation is undoubtedly too high for the bloch oscillations to be directly observed ( @xmath80  hz ) .",
    "there are a significant number of numerical issues that need to be taken into account to be able to determine the green s functions , and other properties of strongly correlated electrons in a large electric field .",
    "to begin , the matrix operators are continuous operators defined along the kadanoff - baym contour , and there is no simple way to find their matrix inverse analytically .",
    "furthermore , matrix multiplication implies an integration over the kadanoff - baym contour @xmath81 which is a complicated line integral in the complex plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ) .",
    "our approach to solve this problem is a common numerical approach ",
    "we discretize the kadanoff - baym contour and evaluate the line integrals as finite riemann sums over the discretized paths .",
    "the matrix operators then become finite - dimensional square matrices , whose size is equal to the number of points used to discretize the kadanoff - baym contour .",
    "once this has been accomplished , then standard lapack and blas routines can be employed to invert and manipulate the discretized versions of the matrix operators .",
    "one issue that needs to be taken into account though is that the inverse of a continuous matrix operator satisfies @xmath82 with @xmath83 the dirac delta function on the contour .",
    "the delta function is represented by the inverse of the time step used in the discretization of the kadanoff - baym contour , but one needs to note that this time step changes sign on the lower ( real ) branch of the contour , and it becomes imaginary on the vertical piece of the contour .",
    "one needs to properly take this into account before using a matrix inversion routine .",
    "next , we need to examine the numerical issues arising in eq .",
    "( [ gf2set ] ) .",
    "we evaluate this equation for a given self - energy matrix @xmath84 .",
    "this requires us to choose values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the two - dimensional gaussian integration , compute the inverse of the matrix @xmath85 , subtract the self - energy , and compute a new matrix inverse .",
    "there is an exact algorithm that allows us to directly compute the matrix inverse of @xmath85 ; this arises from the equation of motion for the green s function , from which the inverse operator can be directly read off .",
    "the only subtlety is to ensure that the inverse operator inherits the correct boundary condition from the green s function .",
    "this is not so simple to carry out , but using techniques like the discretization scheme in negele and orland  @xcite and kamenev  @xcite provides a systematic method to directly compute the matrix inverse which satisfies the requisite boundary condition and becomes the exact matrix - operator inverse in the limit where the discretization step size goes to zero .",
    "the last matrix inversion is a general complex matrix inversion , because the self - energy is complex - valued , and has no simple symmetries .",
    "hence , it is the most `` expensive '' matrix inversion that needs to be performed .",
    "next the matrix elements of the inverse are multiplied by the relevant weighting factors for the integration , and finally we accumulate the results over all @xmath40 and @xmath41 terms that we choose for the two - dimensional integral .",
    "since the integral weights are gaussian , it seems reasonable to employ a gaussian integral scheme for choosing the points on the grids and the weights .",
    "unfortunately , since each point in the two - dimensional integration requires one full matrix inversion , we need to minimize the number of points chosen . as a compromise",
    ", we use the following scheme : ( i ) we perform the integral using an @xmath86 gaussian integration ; ( ii ) repeat with an @xmath87 gaussian integration ; and ( iii ) average the results . the @xmath86 case requires @xmath88 grid points and the @xmath87 case requires @xmath89 grid points .",
    "we choose to average these two results , because terms in the green s function often behave like @xmath90 , which can be accurately represented by the gaussian integration until @xmath13 becomes on the order of the inverse of the grid spacing of the gaussian integration near @xmath91 .",
    "then , the sampling over the discrete points will no longer cancel , and the gaussian integration will overestimate the value of the integral .",
    "since the grid spacing for @xmath92 points nearly interlaces that for @xmath93 , the results of the averaging over @xmath93 and @xmath92 grids produces accurate results for values of @xmath13 up to two times larger than what is possible for either one alone , and in the double integral case , it produces a factor of two reduction in computation time from using a gaussian integration scheme with twice the number of points .",
    "this part of the dmft algorithm , the calculation of the local green s function from the self - energy , is easily parallelized .",
    "one simply ships the self - energy matrix , and the energy variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 to the individual nodes , generates the relevant matrix , performs the inversion , and sends the result back to the master node for accumulation .",
    "once the local green s function has been calculated , then we proceed with the remainder of the dmft algorithm to determine the new self - energy matrix .",
    "this part of the code is not so simple to parallelize , because it must proceed in a serial fashion .",
    "the only possible parallelization will occur if we can use slapack routines to distribute the calculation of the matrix inverses over a small set of processors . to date",
    ", we have not included this element in the computation .    the algorithm given by eqs .",
    "( [ gf2set])([sigmaset ] ) is iterated until it converges .",
    "as the size of the matrices is made larger , by choosing a larger maximal cutoff in time for the kadanoff - baym contour , or by fixing the maximal cutoff time and reducing the step size , then the algorithm slows down significantly , and it becomes more difficult to attain the same level of accuracy at the end of the iterations .",
    "we usually try to iterate the solutions at least @xmath94 times for full convergence , but sometimes we have to limit ourselves to about @xmath95 iterations due to the computational time involved .",
    "= 2.83 in    = 2.83 in    = 2.83 in    = 2.90 in    = 2.90 in    = 2.90 in    there are a number of numerical issues that play a role in the quantitative accuracy of the results .",
    "these include the maximal time chosen for the cutoff @xmath96 , the step size in real time @xmath97 , and the number of points @xmath93 chosen for the @xmath40 grids . in this work ,",
    "we examine a number of different choices for these parameters to see which terms are the most important for maintaining accuracy of the results .",
    "we do this employing what is probably one of the most difficult cases for the nonequilibrium code , that of a vanishing electric field ( corresponding to an equilibrium situation ) .",
    "there is a major simplification of this approach because we have no @xmath41 dependence in our formulas , and the integral over @xmath41 can be done trivially .",
    "the problem arises from the fact that the self - energy develops a delta function in frequency at @xmath98 in the insulating state , and this function can not be easily represented in a calculation for real time that has a finite cutoff along the time axis .",
    "indeed , we find that it is difficult to obtain good results for the self - energy as a function of frequency in this case .",
    "but we also check the moments of the self - energy and the green s function , and find good agreement for the low - power moments , indicating that the results do work well for short times .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to think that they do a good job at determining the initial transient response to an electric field after the field is turned on .",
    "furthermore , we do not know whether the delta function in the self - energy survives when a field is turned on .",
    "if it does nt , then the nonequilibrium approach may work well for the insulating cases , even if it has problems for the equilibrium system .",
    "the electronic density of states is a quantum - mechanical measure of the elementary excitations of a strongly correlated material . in most materials ,",
    "the density of states spans a range of a few electron volts , or in our units , a few @xmath39 .",
    "the fourier transform of the density of states is closely related to the green s functions in the time domain .",
    "we expect the time - dependent green s functions to have important time dependence when @xmath63 is smaller than @xmath99 for some constant @xmath13 of order one . hence choosing a cutoff in time on the order of @xmath100",
    "@xmath101 is a reasonable choice .",
    "the above heuristic discussion holds when the system is metallic .",
    "when it becomes insulating , then the density of states has a gap , and the self - energy develops a pole , for small frequencies . in this case , we need a large time domain ( infinite in the case of a delta function ) to properly reproduce the density of states or self - energy after fourier transforming .",
    "this means that the time - domain cutoff needs to be made larger as the electron correlations are made stronger .",
    "similarly , the more fine - structure that is present in the green s functions as functions of time , the smaller the step size @xmath97 in the time domain needs to be to be able to accurately discretize the matrix operators . in general",
    ", we expect the discretization error to grow as the electron correlations increase , so @xmath97 will need to be reduced for larger values of @xmath12 .",
    "we typically choose @xmath102 in our calculations .",
    "obviously , we can not keep increasing the time domain , and decreasing the step size when we have finite computational resources . the maximal matrix that we consider",
    "has a size on the order of @xmath103 .",
    "this choice is not a function of memory limitations , but rather is an issue of the computational time needed to invert these matrices as part of the dmft algorithm .",
    "the bottom line is that these calculations will not be able to be pushed to too large a value for @xmath12 without running into resource problems .    in order to benchmark our code ,",
    "we have chosen to examine the equilibrium solutions using the nonequilibrium formalism .",
    "this is a particularly nice exercise to undertake , because the equilibrium solutions are all known to high accuracy via a direct solution using an algorithm in the frequency domain  @xcite .",
    "it is also a challenging test of the nonequilibrium codes , because we need to fourier transform the solutions in time to functions of frequency , and the effects of the discretization step size , and of the time - domain cutoff can play critical roles in the accuracy . the other important parameter in governing the accuracy",
    "is the step size employed in the energy integrations to determine the local green s function .",
    "as discussed above , if the step size is too large , then we can generate spurious signal at large relative times , which will fourier transform into high - frequency wiggles in the frequency domain .",
    "if we know that such structures are not present in the exact results , we can easily filter them out , but this becomes problematic when we are not sure whether such structures are real or numerical artifacts ( which occurs when we perform nonequilibrium calculations ) .",
    "we benchmark our results by examining the equilibrium solutions at high temperature ( @xmath104 ) and for a large value of @xmath12 ( @xmath105 ) that is still in the metallic phase ( the metal - insulator transition occurs at @xmath106 ) .",
    "we choose this for our initial benchmarking exercise because the self - energy does not have a pole ; hence , the numerical issues should be under better control .",
    "we will briefly discuss issues that occur in the insulating phase below .",
    "our first result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_w ] .",
    "it plots the lesser self - energy at @xmath107 as a function of @xmath108 , which is calculated by performing the fourier transformation with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "this result should be independent of @xmath64 , because we are in equilibrium , but the results do have a small dependence on @xmath64 , that is due to the fact that we have instituted a finite cutoff in time @xmath109 . in this figure",
    ", we study how sensitive the results are to changing the number of points in the integration over @xmath40 ( recall , the integration over @xmath41 is trivial when we are in equilibrium ) .",
    "the blue curve is the exact result , the black curve employs gaussian integration , averaging over the @xmath86 and @xmath87 cases , while the red curve is similar with @xmath110 and @xmath111 points .",
    "the green curve uses a much smaller step size in @xmath40 , employing @xmath112 points in a trapezoidal rule integration , ranging from @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "note how all of the results lie on top of each other for small @xmath108 , although they do differ from the exact result . in the tails , for larger @xmath115",
    ", we see oscillations develop for the gaussian integrations , that are reduced as the step size is made smaller , and completely disappear by the time @xmath112 .",
    "these results show that by carefully controlling the step size used for the energy integration , one can obtain converged results without any extraneous oscillations , but those converged results are not exact , because they were calculated with finite values for @xmath97 and @xmath96 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_t ] , we show the results for the imaginary part of the lesser self - energy as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "once can see particularly good quantitative agreement for small times , and then there is a region with oscillations out in the tail ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "this region is blown up in the inset .",
    "the oscillations are only present for the coarse @xmath40 integrations , and the amplitude of the oscillations shrinks as the step size is made smaller .",
    "it is precisely these spurious results that lead to the oscillations in the fourier transform ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_w ] ) .",
    "if we know about this kind of spurious behavior , we can filter the oscillations out before performing the fourier transform , but this is an _ ad hoc _ procedure that can not be generalized to the nonequilibrium case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_w2 ] , we show the @xmath97 dependence of the calculations with fixed values for @xmath109 , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 averaged gaussian integrations .",
    "the results vary the most at small frequency , and appear to systematically approach the exact result as @xmath117 .",
    "the results are less sensitive to @xmath97 for larger frequencies , and since we have already seen that reducing the step size in @xmath40 tends to only smooth out the oscillations ( without changing the shape too much ) , the errors at higher frequencies must be coming from the finite cutoff @xmath96 .",
    "finally , we show the green s function as a function of @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gf_t ] .",
    "the imaginary part is in the main plot , and the real part is in the inset . in the exact result ( blue curve ) ,",
    "the imaginary part is an even function , and the real part is an odd function .",
    "the results of the nonequilibrium calculation do not share this symmetry , but it appears to be getting restored as @xmath118 .",
    "more problematic is the issue of the value of @xmath58 at @xmath119 , which is determined solely by the electron filling .",
    "the results appear to be getting worse as @xmath118",
    ". it must be that if we increase the time cutoff , the results will ultimately start moving back toward their correct value , but we can not check this explicitly due to the finite computer resources that are available",
    ".    we can be more quantitative about the short time behavior though .",
    "to do so , we can calculate the first few moments of the integrals of the green s function and the self - energy over @xmath108 , and compare them to the exact results for those integrals .",
    "the zeroth moment relates to the function at @xmath119 , the first power to the slope , and the second power to the curvature .",
    "when we examine the results for @xmath120 and @xmath105 , we find the zeroth moment of @xmath121 and @xmath122 is in error by about @xmath123% , the first moment by @xmath95% for @xmath121 and @xmath124% for @xmath122 , and the second moment of @xmath121 and @xmath122 by @xmath125% .",
    "the results do not depend too strongly on the step size for @xmath40 in the integrations , as expected , because the oscillations average out of the moments .",
    "the first moment appears to extrapolate to its correct value as @xmath118 for the @xmath86 , @xmath126 gaussian integration with a fixed @xmath96 , but the zeroth and second moments do not appear as if they scale to the right result .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the @xmath96 needs to be increased , but the large step size for @xmath40 may also play a role .",
    "when we try to examine the insulating phase , we find the agreement with the exact results becomes much worse .",
    "this is because there are low - energy features which require large times to be determined accurately . also , the larger @xmath12 , the smaller @xmath97 needs to be to obtain good accuracy .",
    "our results for @xmath127 are too preliminary to report quantitative values here .",
    "the important question is whether these low - energy features survive as the electric field is turned on .",
    "if they are destroyed by the field , then the computational scheme that we are using should be able to accurately determine nonequilibrium results at short times .",
    "if they survive , then it will be difficult to get high accuracy results for the nonequilibrium case in the mott insulator . since the presence of a field pumps energy into the system , and that energy can be used to create excitations across a gap , it is easy to believe that the gap features do not survive the introduction of a large electric field , but we can not definitively say whether this is actually true at this point .",
    "one of the most interesting nonlinear phenomena of a material is the production of bloch oscillations in the current as a function of time when a constant ( @xmath72 ) electric field is applied . in the absence of interactions ( which cause scattering ) , the current will oscillate forever , with a constant amplitude ( the period is determined by the strength of the electric field ) . as we turn on the scattering",
    ", we expect the oscillations to be dampened , but perhaps to maintain the same period ( and even survive in the steady state ) .",
    "if the scattering becomes large enough , then the oscillations should disappear completely . by calculating the green s functions in the presence of a field that is turned on at @xmath107",
    ", we can study how the current initially starts , and how it evolves into a steady state . due to the need for a finite @xmath96",
    ", we can only go so far out in time before the calculation must terminate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_0.5 ] , we plot the bloch oscillations of the current as a function of the average time , for @xmath120 , @xmath104 , @xmath128 , and the @xmath86 , @xmath126 gaussian integration scheme .",
    "the @xmath96 is equal to 15 .",
    "as @xmath97 is reduced , one can clearly see that the results are beginning to converge .",
    "furthermore , it is also clear that there is a damping of the transient response as we move forward in time .",
    "we examine the behavior of this transient damping in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_u ] , where we have preliminary results for the current density for three values of @xmath12 . the results for @xmath120 and @xmath105 ,",
    "are calculated with a step size of @xmath129 . at the moment , it is not clear how much of an effect the boundaries at @xmath96 have on the results , but it may be that the largest time results are not fully trustworthy",
    ". some interesting behavior can be seen in the figure : ( i ) we see the damping that is expected , and that it gets more strongly damped as @xmath12 is increased ; ( ii ) as @xmath12 is increased , it appears that the period may be decreasing , which is not an expected result ; and ( iii ) the behavior of the transient evolution is quite complex , and we do not appear to have reached the steady state yet .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that there is a straightforward way to perform many - body physics calculations in real time for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations by formulating the problem on a kadanoff - baym contour and discretizing it .",
    "there are a number of numerical issues that arise from this approach , coming from the discretization of the contour and its truncation , as well as from the discretization of the energy space needed to perform numerical quadratures . by using the equilibrium results as a benchmark",
    ", we can see how the different discretization operations affect the overall accuracy of the calculations .",
    "it seems like the small - time behavior can be understood fairly well by using reasonable choices for the discretizations and the time - domain cutoffs .",
    "it is more difficult to obtain good results for the longer - time behavior .",
    "one also needs to have good control of the numerics to be able to accurately perform fourier transformations to real frequency . maintaining control of these different approximations",
    "is made more difficult by the finite computational power that is available to solve these problems .",
    "the fact that we must iterate our equations to a self - consistent solution brings a number of unknown issues to the table .",
    "first , we have modified the green s function by introducing a time - domain cutoff , which is artificially changing the boundary conditions .",
    "it is well known that green s functions are determined uniquely by their equation of motion and their boundary conditions .",
    "how much of an effect the change of the boundary condition has on the results is difficult to estimate because of the nonlinearities introduced by the iterative solution .",
    "second , we are not able to iterate the equations for an infinitely long period of time , so the smaller we make the discretizations , the fewer iterations we are able to complete . for example , when the matrices have a size on the order of @xmath130 , we can easily perform 50 or more iterations , but we are reduced to about 7 iterations when they are @xmath131 .",
    "it is difficult to tell how much error is introduced by this .    in the future",
    ", we will use this technique to study and analyze better the behavior of strongly correlated materials in a large electric field .",
    "eventually , we hope to be able to generalize this approach to apply it to multilayered nanostructures and thereby be able to directly calculate the current - voltage characteristic of a strongly correlated device .",
