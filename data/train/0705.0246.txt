    "black holes have always attracted the interest of all physicists who hope to see general relativity at work in a completely non - perturbative regime , outside any post - newtonian expansion .",
    "since most of the information we receive from black holes and their surroundings is in the form of electromagnetic waves , one of the fundamental problems to be faced is the propagation of such waves in a black hole spacetime .",
    "the situation can be possibly complicated by an accretion disk formed by neutral plasma @xcite . for wavelengths at which observations are typically lead",
    ", the geometrical optics approximation provides a very robust description for the propagation of the light rays , defined as the lines orthogonal to the wavefronts . in all situations in which the plasma physics has little effect on the rays trajectories ,",
    "the light rays simply follow null geodesics",
    ". then all questions that involve the propagation of an electromagnetic signal require integration of the null geodesics equation . in the case of kerr metric",
    ", the null geodesics have been expressed by carter in terms of first integrals through the separation of the hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "then , the integrals involved in these geodesics can be solved in terms of elliptic functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although these analytical solutions are not particularly illuminating by themselves , they can be successfully employed to build fast and accurate numerical codes @xcite , by which one can get particular answers , such as the shape of the iron k - line or the appearance of the accretion flow into the black hole in a future hypothetical high - resolution image @xcite .    the problem of finding the null geodesics connecting a source to an observer in a curved background is usually referred to as gravitational lensing .",
    "it has been pointed out by many authors that in a black hole spacetime there are infinitely many possible trajectories for the photons emitted by a point - source to reach the observer @xcite . for",
    "each of these trajectories the observer will detect an independent image of the original source .",
    "the images can be classified according to the number of loops performed by the corresponding photons around the black hole .",
    "one starts from the primary and secondary image , which are formed by photons performing no loops .",
    "these are already present in the classical weak deflection limit of gravitational lensing . besides these , there are two infinite sequences of higher order images , formed by photons performing one or more loops around the black hole before reaching the observer .",
    "these images are progressively fainter and appear closer and closer to the apparent shadow cast by the black hole on the sky .",
    "the higher order images contribute much less than the primary and secondary images to the total flux and are often completely masked in situations in which they are not separable from the main images @xcite .",
    "therefore , the best chances to observe higher order images are offered by a black hole as massive and close to us as possible , so that its apparent angular size is the largest .",
    "the natural candidate is the black hole at the center of our galaxy , identified with the radio - source sgr a*. this is believed to be a @xmath1 supermassive black hole slowly accreting material from the surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "its distance is @xmath2kpc , so that the schwarzschild radius @xmath3 of this black hole spans an angle of roughly 9 @xmath4as in our sky . a resolution of this order of magnitude is needed to detect the higher order images , besides the requirement of negligible absorption in the wavelength of the emitted signal by the surrounding material . in spite of these difficulties , the detection of higher order images of sources around sgr a * should be at hand of future interferometers operating in the sub - mm range , where one expects to detect higher order images of bright spots on the accretion disk @xcite , or in the x - ray band , where low mass x - ray binaries and other sources are active @xcite .",
    "such images would be invaluable witnesses of the strong gravitational field around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy ; their direct observation would thus be of striking importance in the confirmation of our gravitational theory .",
    "in addition to the considerations about their importance , higher order images can boast two advantages with respect to lower order ones : if the black hole has non - negligible spin , they can easily form large arcs and additional images because their caustics have a larger angular extension compared to the first caustic ; secondly , they enjoy a relatively much simpler analytical description .",
    "the treatment of higher order images can take advantage of the fact that the deflection diverges logarithmically when the impact parameter reaches a minimum value .",
    "then , the higher order images can be obtained by a simplified lens equation where the deflection terms are replaced by the first terms of their expansions in terms of the impact parameter .",
    "this procedure is analogous to the weak deflection limit but sets its starting point in the opposite regime and is thus conventionally called _ strong deflection limit_. it was firstly used by darwin in 1959 for the schwarzschild black hole @xcite and then revived several times @xcite until it was generalized to all spherically symmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "this method was then applied to several interesting black hole metrics , also motivated by string and alternative theories @xcite .",
    "the time delay calculation for higher order images was done in ref .",
    "the method was recently extended to the presence of external shear fields in a setup analogous to the chang & refsdal lens @xcite .",
    "the extension to kerr metric has required several steps , starting from the purely equatorial case @xcite to the case of generic trajectories with equatorial observers @xcite , and finally to the general case @xcite ( in the latter two works , the treatment is however limited to the second order in the black hole spin ) .",
    "an application to the kerr - sen dilaton - axion black hole has also been performed @xcite .",
    "recently iyer and petters have found an alternative expansion parameter that significantly reduces the discrepancy between the strong deflection limit and the exact deflection formula @xcite .",
    "they have also explored the next to leading order terms in the strong deflection expansion .",
    "the strong deflection limit allows a simple analytic investigation of the gravitational lensing properties of any black hole metric in a well - defined limit , in which the results are easily comparable from one metric to another . for the kerr metric it has been able to provide the first analytical formulae for the caustics and the critical curves involving higher order images and for lensing of sources near caustics .",
    "however , in the formulation used up to now , it has just been applied to sources very far from the black hole , so that the limit @xmath5 has been taken in all equations ( here @xmath6 is the distance of the source from the black hole and @xmath7 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole ) .    the purpose of this paper is to remove the limitation to very far sources , enlarging the investigation of gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit to sources placed at arbitrary distances from the black hole .",
    "we will thus be able to discuss the mathematical structure of the lensing problem and all the lensing observables taking @xmath6 as an additional parameter .",
    "we will show that the strong deflection limit is well - defined even for sources inside the photon sphere , so that our discussion can be safely pushed up to sources lying just outside the horizon of the black hole .",
    "similarly , in the kerr metric we will be able to describe the caustic hypersurface from infinite radial distance up to the horizon .",

    "we can note that asymptotic flatness drives the function @xmath14 to approach @xmath15 at very large @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , in any metric admitting a static limit @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 , the function @xmath14 diverges at @xmath17 .",
    "so , by continuity it must have at least one minimum greater than @xmath17 . as a useful reference , in fig .",
    "[ fig c / a ] , we plot the function @xmath14 for the schwarschild spacetime , where it assumes the form @xmath19 .",

    "we are actually interested in minima of @xmath14 , since they give rise to logarithmic divergences in the deflection angle , as it will be clear later .",
    "although it is relatively easy to find metrics which also develop a maximum in @xmath14 ( e.g. reissner - nordstrm with superextremal charge ) , it seems difficult to imagine a metric developing a second minimum .",
    "such a metric would require a quite exotic source to be sustained as a viable solution of gravitational equations . through assumption ( c )",
    ", we are discarding these too problematic spacetimes and stick to more reasonable metrics with only one minimum for @xmath14 .",
    "now let us start the calculation of the photon deflection .",
    "the spherical symmetry allows us to choose the equatorial plane as the plane where the entire motion of the photon takes place , so that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where the dot denotes derivative with respect to the affine parameter .",

    "they can be identified with the specific energy @xmath25 and angular momentum @xmath26 @xmath27 we can choose the orientation of the polar axis so that @xmath28 .",
    "the last constant of motion comes from the fact that the photon moves along null geodesics of the metric ( [ metric ] ) so that @xmath29 . from this equation",
    ", we derive the expression of @xmath30 : @xmath31    the angle formed by the spatial components of the photon momentum @xmath32 with a normalized vector tangent to a sphere centered on the black hole @xmath33 is @xmath34    so , in any point of the photon trajectory , the knowledge of the value of the combination @xmath35 allows us to calculate the angles formed by the photon with respect to the radial and tangent directions .",
    "the photon moves radially if @xmath36 and tangentially in points such that @xmath37 .",
    "it is also easy to prove that for those photons reaching the asymptotic flat region , this quantity equals the impact parameter , defined as the distance between the black hole and the asymptotic trajectory followed by the photon . on the basis of its immediate connection with the observed direction of the photon",

    "all these considerations can be summarized by saying that light rays shot at too small impact parameters are swallowed by the black hole , whereas those shot at larger impact parameters are just deflected , the limiting value of @xmath38 being @xmath51 .",
    "our objective is to quantify the deflection of these photons as a function of @xmath38 .    the azimuthal shift of the photon is @xmath52 where we have separated the motion of the photon into approach phase ( with @xmath16 running from @xmath6 to the inversion point @xmath50 ) and departure phase ( with @xmath16 running from @xmath50 to @xmath53 ) .",

    "the latter argument is completely independent of our perturbative expansion in the black hole spin , proving that the logarithmic divergence is not an artifact of our perturbative framework .",
    "moreover , the divergence of @xmath262 is not even a product of the strong deflection limit , since it is still there whatever the values of the constants of motion @xmath26 and @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , it seems plausible to us that even the primary caustic tube ( with @xmath171 ) , which is not included in our treatment , should show a similar behavior , winding an infinite number of times before entering the horizon .",
    "this seems not to be observed in the numerical analysis by rauch & blandford @xcite , where the primary caustic tube always appears to perform a finite number of loops before plunging into the horizon , except for the extremal case @xmath266 .",
    "it is anyhow difficult to believe that the divergence is compensated by any of the remaining terms in eq .",
    "( [ geod2 ] ) for intermediate values of @xmath94 .",
    "our formulae ( [ caumu2 ] ) and ( [ caugamma2 ] ) represent the transverse section of the caustic tube at fixed @xmath6",
    ". one might be interested to a different transverse section , e.g. the section at fixed @xmath267 .",
    "this is particularly interesting to study the approach of the caustic tube to the horizon , when the drift is large and @xmath6 is very close to 1 . in this approximation , we can find the following expression for any fixed value of @xmath267 @xmath268\\right\\ } \\label{caudls},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath269 is the difference between the chosen value of @xmath267 and the asymptotic drift of the caustic center .",
    "this expression is strictly valid for large values of @xmath270 , but since the caustic drift sensibly increases only when @xmath6 is very close to 1 , it is sufficient that @xmath271 in order to validate this expansion .",
    "[ fig causect ] shows the transverse sections of a caustic tube obtained at different values of @xmath270 .",
    "as the drift is increased , the caustic becomes thinner and thinner while it approaches the horizon .",
    "the higher order images of ordinary sources like stars or x - ray binaries are usually very faint , except for the event of a caustic crossing .",
    "therefore , although in principle it is possible to analyze the lens equation in the general case , it is much more interesting to study the gravitational lensing of a source in the neighborhood of a caustic .",
    "this case is certainly the most relevant for observations and is worth a complete and detailed analysis .",
    "the position of a source near a caustic can be expanded in the following way @xmath272 @xmath273 with @xmath274 and @xmath275 being of the same order of the caustic extension @xmath276 , thus weighing as @xmath277 in the perturbative expansion .",
    "correspondingly , the solutions of the lens equation will be very close to the critical points .",
    "we can thus use the following expansion for @xmath226 @xmath278 with @xmath279 being of order @xmath277 .    using these expansions in eq .",
    "( [ lensapp ] ) , @xmath280 can be obtained as a function of the source position and @xmath194 @xmath281^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\cdot \\left\\ { ( 3 - 2\\mu_o^2-\\hat\\xi^2)(3+d_{ls})(2d_{ls}-3 ) \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\cdot \\left[9 - 2d_{ls}-2(2d_{ls}-3)(\\sqrt{d_{ls}}-\\sqrt{3+d_{ls}})^2\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left . -4d_{ls}(3+d_{ls})(2d_{ls}-3)(5-\\hat\\xi^2)+108d_{ls } \\hat\\xi^2 \\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas @xmath194 is determined by the equation @xmath282 in which @xmath283 is inherited by the sign ambiguity of the @xmath229 parametrization ( see @xcite for more details about the resolution of the sign ambiguity ) .",
    "note that the lens equation formally remains the same as in the @xmath284 case , though the position and the extension of the caustic have changed .",
    "the @xmath194 equation ( [ xieq ] ) can be easily put in the form of a fourth degree polynomial equation .",
    "it admits two solutions if the source is outside the caustic and four solutions if the source is inside the caustic .",
    "the solutions so obtained satisfy the original equation ( [ xieq ] ) with one definite choice of the sign @xmath285 , which is then univocally determined for each image .",
    "once we have the position of the image in the @xmath229 space , it is straightforward to write the position of the image in the observer sky . to this purpose , it is important to note that @xmath194 is known through eq .",
    "( [ xieq ] ) to zero order only .",
    "so , the position of the image on the observer sky is consistently determined to zero order as @xmath286 with @xmath244 given by eq .",
    "( [ epsk ] ) .",
    "the image appears on the critical ring of order @xmath170 at a position angle @xmath287 and half - sky determined by the sign @xmath285 .      in typical gravitational lensing studies ,",
    "the change in the apparent brightness of the source is simply given by the geometrical magnification , defined as the ratio of the elementary angular area of the image and the angular area of the source as it would be seen without any gravitational lensing .",
    "when the source is far from the lens , this definition makes sense , since the background metric is asymptotically flat and we can speak of a source without the lens by simply re - interpreting the source coordinates as coordinates in the asymptotic minkowski metric .",
    "this procedure loses any meaning when the source is deeply within the gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "moreover , the frequency of the emitted photon does not coincide with the frequency detected by the observer because of gravitational redshift .",
    "conservation of the photon number warrants that the quantity @xmath288 is conserved on a bundle of light rays , with @xmath289 being the specific intensity , defined as the energy @xmath290 crossing a surface element @xmath291 pointing an angular area @xmath292 in the time interval @xmath293 and frequency interval @xmath294 .    in order to build a simulated lensed image of a source close to a black hole ,",
    "one just needs to find the position of the image for any point belonging to the source and determine the specific intensity observed at that point .",
    "the position of the higher order images for any given source position can be read from eqs .",
    "( [ 2image1 ] ) and ( [ 2image2 ] ) , whereas the specific intensity measured by the observer is related to the specific intensity emitted by the source through the relativistic relation @xmath295 where the redshift factor can be calculated as usual as @xmath296 with @xmath297 being the momentum of the photon and @xmath298 being the 4-velocity of the emitting particle . in stationary spherically symmetric and in boyer - lindquist coordinates for the kerr metric , @xmath299 is a killing vector and thus @xmath300 is a conserved quantity ( we have put it to 1 by a choice of the affine parameter ) .",
    "so , for any point of the source we can find the location of the corresponding high order images and if any model provides us the specific intensity of the source at that point , we can calculate the specific intensity as seen by the observer .    in the case in which",
    "the source is transparent , it can be conveniently characterized by its volume emissivity @xmath301 , defined as the energy @xmath290 in the frequency interval @xmath302 emitted by the proper spacetime volume @xmath303 centered on @xmath304 in a solid angle @xmath292 centered on the direction given by the vector @xmath305 .    if we want the specific intensity measured by the observer in the sky direction @xmath189 , we just have to trace back the null geodesic reaching the observer with such a direction and sum up the contributions given by all source elements along this geodesic .",
    "we thus have @xcite @xmath306 where @xmath307 is the geodesic line element as measured in the emitter frame .",
    "year after year , our knowledge on the environment surrounding the supermassive black holes is growing at a higher and higher rate , thanks to the surprising development of the technology related to high resolution observations .",
    "angular resolutions of the order of the microarcsecond are now reachable in the radio band and sooner or later will be reached in the sub - mm and x - ray band . at the same time , the interferometric observations in the infrared at the keck telescopes and at vlt are unveiling a very rich stellar enviroment around the galactic center , which is drawing more and more interest .",
    "high resolution observations are the premise for the discovery of possible signatures of general relativity effects from supermassive black holes , which would open a new era in the understanding of gravitational physics .    within this context , the comprehension of the propagation of photons in a strong field environment is of capital importance .",
    "many numerical codes partially exploiting the analytical solutions of kerr geodesics are available and have been used to build simulated images of the black holes . at the same time",
    ", analytical studies have been complementarily developed to conquer precious insight about the mathematical structure of the lens mapping in this very special gravitational lensing framework .",
    "the strong deflection limit allows to study gravitational lensing in the extreme situation of photons travelling very close to the unstable circular orbit around the black hole .",
    "such photons give rise to an infinite sequence of additional images which contribute to the total flux received by the observer by a non - negligible amount ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an estimate of their relevance ) .",
    "therefore , the study of such images is far from being a mere academic exercise , but acquires a striking importance by the fact that these images carry invaluable information about the strong gravitational fields around the black hole . whereas complete numerical studies of these images are difficult because of the extreme accuracy required to follow photons travelling around the unstable circular orbit , analytical studies benefit from the great simplification introduced by the strong deflection limit",
    "therefore , higher order images represent a unique window where we can confront simple analytical results from general relativity with observations .    in this paper",
    "we have removed the traditional limitation of the strong deflection limit to sources very far from the black hole .",
    "we have thus analytically explored extreme gravitational lensing of sources close to a black hole for the first time .",
    "there is no limitation to the validity of our results , which are applicable even to sources just outside the horizon .    in the spherically symmetric case",
    ", we have shown that the same formulae for the deflection of the photon can be applied both to sources outside the photon sphere and to sources inside the photon sphere , whose images appear inside the so - called shadow border .",
    "we have specified our formulae to the schwarzschild case in order to test the validity of the strong deflection limit throughout the range of source distances .    for the kerr black hole ,",
    "the only modification comes in the resolution of the radial integrals in the geodesics equations .",
    "this brings to a modification of the size and shape of the critical curves .",
    "we have obtained a complete analytical description of the caustic tube from infinite distances up to the horizon , showing that the caustic tube winds indefinitely around the black hole because of a logarithmic divergence in the azimuthal geodesic equation .",
    "we have also updated the gravitational lensing of sources near a caustic .",
    "the formulae contained in this paper can be applied to physically motivated models of sources around a supermassive black hole , where they can be used to calculate the shape and the brightness of the higher order images .",
    "we leave this interesting task to future work , contenting ourselves with the complete analytical derivation of all relevant formulae here .",
