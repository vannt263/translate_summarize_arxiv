    "the study of gravitational collapse started from the pioneer work of chandrasekhar ( 1936 ) . later on , oppenheimer and snyder ( 19390investigated that the spherically symmetric homogenous dust collapse leads to the formation of black hole ( bh ) .",
    "initially , it was argued that the homogeneity and spherical symmetry of the collapsing model are responsible for the formation of bh .",
    "however , it was found ( lemaitre 1933 ) that inhomogeneous dust collapse would end as shell crossing and shell focusing singularities .",
    "after many years , it was proved ( joshi 1997 ) that the shell crossing singularity is naked , while shell focusing singularity might represent bh , depending on the choice of initial data of collapse .",
    "hence , it was concluded that the homogeneity of the collapsing model is not a sufficient condition for the formation of bh . in order to generalize the collapsing matter ,",
    "it becomes necessary to study the collapse of more realistic matter with non - vanishing pressure .",
    "misner and sharp ( 1964 ) studied perfect fluid collapse and found bh as the end state of gravitational collapse .",
    "also , herrera and santos ( 1997 ) explored the properties of anisotropic self - gravitating spheres and discussed their stability using the perturbation method .",
    "herrera and his collaborators ( herrera et al.2008a , herrera et al . 2008b , herrera at al .",

    "2012 ) have discussed the stability and applications of anisotropic solutions to stellar collapse .",
    "recently , glass ( 2013 ) has formulated a generating solution of anisotropic spherically symmetric solutions which reveal either expansion and collapse depending on the choice of time profile of the solutions .",
    "this work has been extended for plane symmetric anisotropic source and charged anisotropic sphere by abbas ( 2014a , 2014b ) .",
    "the present paper is the cylindrical version of the these papers .",
    "the current observational evidences of gravitational waves ( through the detectors ligo ( abramovici et al .",
    "1992 ) and geo ( l@xmath4ck and geo 600 team 1997 ) have increased the interest to study the gravitational collapse in cylindrically symmetric systems .",
    "the spherical systems are simple and do not provide non - trivial examples in the generic gravitational collapse .",
    "therefore , the study of cylindrical collapse is much important as compared to spherical systems .",
    "some numerical studies ( piran 1978 ) provide the generation of gravitational waves from cylindrical collapse .",
    "these results have been extended analytically ( nakao and morisawa 2004 ) to study gravitational waves during cylindrical gravitational collapse .",
    "sharif and ahmad ( 2007 ) generalized this work for two perfect fluid cylindrical collapse and discussed the generation of gravitational waves .",
    "di prisco et al.(2009 ) studied the shearfree gravitational collapse of the anisotropic fluid in the cylindrically symmetric spacetime .",
    "the applications of the electromagnetic field in astronomy and astrophysics is an active research domain .",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to discuss the collective effects of electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "till now , there is a little progress about the effects of electromagnetic field on gravitational collapse of stars .",
    "thorne ( 1965 ) studied cylindrically symmetric gravitational collapse with magnetic field and concluded that magnetic field can prevent the collapse of cylinder before singularity formation .",
    "ardvan and partovi ( 1977 ) investigated dust solution of the field equations with electromagnetic field and found that the electrostatic force is balanced by gravitational force during collapse of charged dust .",
    "the effects of electromagnetic field on structure scalars and dynamics of self - gravitating objects have been explored by herrera and his collaborators ( herrera et al .",
    "2011 , diprisco et al . 2007 ) .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section * 2 * , charged anisotropic cylindrical source and einstein - maxwell equations have presented .",
    "section * 3 * is devoted to the generating solutions which represent gravitational collapse and expansion of the self - gravitating charged cylinder .",
    "we summaries the results of the paper in the last section .",
    "this section deals with the interior matter distribution and corresponding einstein - maxwell s equations .",
    "the non - static spacetime with cylindrical symmetry in the interior region of a star is given by ( sharif and bhatti 2015 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the restrictions on the coordinates of cylinder .",
    "in the interior region of cylindrically symmetric star , we have considered the charged anisotropic fluid for which energy - momentum is given by ( di prisco et al .",
    "2009 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9,and @xmath10 are the energy density , pressures in @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath13 is four - velocity and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are four - vectors .",
    "also , @xmath16 is the maxwell field tensor with four - potential @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the unit four - vectors which satisfy the following relations @xmath18 in comoving coordinate system , these quantities can be written as @xmath19    the maxwell field s equations are @xmath20}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the four - current . in comoving coordinates ,",
    "the charge inside the cylinder is at rest , so we can define the four - potential and four - current as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are charge density and scalar potential , respectively .",
    "the expansion scalar is @xmath25 we define the dimensionless anisotropy as follows : @xmath26 the corresponding einstein - maxwell s equations have the following form @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 is the total amount of charge per unit length of the cylinder .",
    "thorne ( 1965 ) defined the mass function for cylindrical geometry in the form of gravitational c - energy per unit length of the cylinder .",
    "the specific energy @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the length of cylinder , i.e. , @xmath33 ) of cylindrical geometry ( [ 1 ] ) in the presence of electric charge is given by ( sharif and bhatti 2015 ) @xmath34.\\ ] ] the auxiliary solution of eq.([6 ] ) is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is arbitrary constant . now using eq.([12 ] ) in eq.([4 ] ) , we get the following form of expansion scalar @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we obtain expanding and collapsing solutions respectively . using eq.([12 ] ) , in eqs.([5])-([10 ] ) , we get the following form of einstein - maxwell s equations : @xmath40 @xmath41 for specific values of @xmath42 and @xmath36 , we can find anisotropic configuration . in this case",
    "mass function along with electromagnetic field given in eq.([11 ] ) takes the following form : @xmath43 if @xmath44 then above equation gives @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that gravitational collapse leads to the formation of a trapping surface at @xmath47 .",
    "also , the integration of trapping condition @xmath44 yields @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an arbitrary function .",
    "for negative and positive values of @xmath36 , we have collapsing and expanding solutions , respectively as follows :      for collapse , expansion scalar will be negative , from eq.([11]),@xmath51 when @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that @xmath50 and the condition @xmath44 , leads to @xmath52 , the integration of this equation yields , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is arbitrary function of time . for @xmath50 , eqs.([14])-([17 ] )",

    "as density is increasing ( see figure.*1 * ) , so cylinder goes on collapsing to a point . in this case , the length of cylinder is constant , i.e. , @xmath62 , therefore base to base collapse is impossible , there is only possibility of wall to wall collapse .",
    "the anisotropic parameter @xmath63 changes its sign from negative to positive .",

    "@xmath68 , for larger value of @xmath69 as shown in figures * 5*. this implies that anisotropic force allows the construction of more massive star while @xmath67 near the center , so there exist an attractive force .",
    "when we talk about an external ( electromagnetic ) field in gravitational , then there is an external force which may distort the generic properties of spacetime effectively .",
    "so , in the present case electromagnetic field enhances the anisotropy and the homogeneity of collapsing star .",
