    "@xcite further , in some range of @xmath16-wavevectors a fit to the @xmath5-dependent experimental @xmath0-data resulted in the repulsive interaction between two roton excitations ,  @xcite opposite to the negative coupling constant suggested in the original model .",
    "this point , has been resolved by a more elaborated theory  @xcite using a t - matrix which allowed the coupling constant to oscillate with @xmath16 .",
    "the dielectric function models interpret the roton and the two - roton state as a specific feature of the sp spectrum coupled in @xmath0 in a superfluid phase .",
    "the standard procedure to follow is to fit the involved key parameters ( @xmath32 ) of the green s function  ( [ gp ] ) to be consistent with the low temperature @xmath0-data .",

    "the density response function @xmath33  ( [ tchi ] ) is treated also as @xmath5-independent , and , therefore , is fitted by high temperature data , where the singular condensate part does not contribute .",
    "the weak point of this model is the discrepancy with experiments near @xmath9 .",
    "the intensity of the sharp peak ( two - roton state ) assigned with the sp excitations ( poles of @xmath11 ) becomes too low as its spectral weight vanishes with @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , a typical experiment on @xmath2he demonstrates a continuous broadening of this peak and nearly conserved integrated spectral weight .",
    "also a broad multi - excitation background , related with @xmath33 , extends significantly to low frequencies , as @xmath5 is increased , being in contradiction with the model assumption on its temperature independence .",
    "these discrepancies have been reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite    the experiments  @xcite provided no indication of a well - defined mode ( sp excitations ) suddenly appearing in @xmath0 for @xmath34 due to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ prove1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , they demonstrated that temperature and density dependence of the spectral density in the phonon and roton part of the spectrum can be fitted with just a single - mode susceptibility .",
    "in particular , the roton mode demonstrates a rapid attenuation when approaching @xmath9 from below and continues as an overdamped diffusive mode of zero frequency above @xmath9 .",
    "the authors concluded `` our results can not be explained using the gg model , unless of course the two components in the gg model hybridize into one ( having one lifetime and excitation energy ) at all temperatures and pressures , independent of the value of @xmath35 '' .",
    "@xcite this suggests , that the phonon - roton spectrum must be considered as _ unified branch _ as was done in the original papers by landau , feynman and bogolubov .",
    "@xcite however the origin of the excitations and their structure can be different . by rigorous considerations",
    ", nepomnyashchy  @xcite has demonstrated that a simultaneous presence in the spectrum of both zero sound ( zs ) and sp branch is not possible . at @xmath36 the zs",
    "is suppressed and replaced by the sp branch defined by poles of the sp green function .",
    "the phonons become identical with the elementary excitations .",
    "the sp branch , however , accumulates some properties of the zs branch , such as linear spectrum and independence on @xmath35 .",
    "this is in a principle contradiction with the ansatz  ( [ tchi ] ) when one uses the substitution @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we note that the bogolubov type spectrum can be also derived without involving the gauge symmetry breaking , i.e. also for a normal phase with the conserved gauge symmetry .",
    "@xcite this implies that the phonon - maxon - roton dispersion , observed in a superfluid , should be also preserved in the normal phase , once the damping is small .",
    "for a 2d dipolar gas , we found that its properties near @xmath9 qualitatively follow that of 3d @xmath2he discussed above . from the comparison of @xmath0 at @xmath37",
    ", we can confirm that the intensity of the two - roton `` plateau '' is unexpectedly too large and does not scale with the zero - temperature condensate fraction once the density is varied .",
    "the condensate demonstrates a broad variation  @xcite ( @xmath38 ) and this implies , that for @xmath10 in  ( [ tchi ] ) , the two - roton peak should be strongly suppressed at high densities , if we assume a roton being solely a sp excitation .",
    "in our simulations we do not find any evidence of this behavior .",
    "the intensity of the peak is not much reduced when approaching @xmath9 either .",
    "formally , in 2d geometry , as considered here , at @xmath39 the condensate fraction should vanish in the thermodynamic limit and no coupling to the sp spectrum is expected . still the two - roton state is observed for @xmath40 and even for @xmath41 at high densities ( but strongly damped ) .",
    "the finite size effects are negligible for the considered system sizes ( @xmath42 ) and , therefore , do not influence the imaginary time correction functions used for the reconstruction of the spectral densities ( sec .",
    "[ qcorrf ] ) .",
    "all observed characteristic spectrum features should remain also in the thermodynamic limit ( except the limit @xmath43 ) .",
    "this brings us to a preliminary conclusion that if the two - roton state is a feature of sp spectrum the sufficient condition for the hybridization in @xmath0 is the presence of at least off - diagonal quasi - long range order and a non - zero superfluid density .",
    "it is important to mention that , there exists a second viewpoint on roton and different combinations ( roton+roton , roton+maxon , maxon+maxon ) as the intrinsic density excitations related with the short - range particle correlations .",
    "@xcite    to clarify these important issues one needs to independently access @xmath0 and the sp spectral density @xmath1 for temperatures below and above @xmath9 to indentify how the excitation branches of both spectra are coupled in the superfluid phase and lead to rotonization .",
    "this gives motivation for the present analysis .",
    "the path integral monte carlo simulations in combination with the stochastic optimization method are used to reconstruct collective and single - particle excitations _ at finite temperatures _ from first principles ( in the linear response regime ) . both should be coupled or form _ a unified branch _ in the density fluctuation spectrum @xmath0 once a system has a condensate or the bose broken symmetry .",
    "@xcite whether this prediction remains also valid for 2d bose systems , with the off - diagonal quasi - long range order and only local bose condensate , remains an open issue and calls for further analysis on the level of microscopic simulations .",
    "such analyses in application to 2d dipolar gas will be presented in sec .",
    "[ disc_spec ] .",
    "in particular , we found that at weak and intermediate coupling ( sec .",
    "[ weak],[intermediate ] ) the single - particle and the collective ( density fluctuations ) modes have similar dispersion relations in the normal phase ( when they are independent ) . as a result , in the superfluid phase due to the coupling ( eq .  [ tchi ] )",
    "both branches become hybridized . in general , the dispersion relation @xmath44 observed in @xmath0 splits into two branches , but the high energy ( multiparticle ) part gets significant broadening in the normal phase . at intermediate @xmath16 ( the maxon - roton region ) the lower branch is shifted to lower energies and its damping is enhanced for @xmath45 .    for strongly correlated dipolar gas ( @xmath46 )",
    "our results support the viewpoint on the roton as a collective density mode .",
    "while , the sp spectrum @xmath1 shows a well pronounced roton minimum ( denoted as @xmath47 ) , the corresponding energies @xmath48 and @xmath49 are larger than those of the roton - minimum ( @xmath50 ) and two - roton state ( pitaevskii `` plateau '' @xmath51 ) observed in @xmath0 . according to the zawadowski s model , this suggests a strong binding mechanism which currently lacks experimental confirmation in other strongly correlated bose systems ( @xmath2he ) .",
    "independent on the presence of the two - roton state , the frequency sum rules ( see appendix  [ app ] ) predict a branch near the recoil energy @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , the simulations reproduce this branch , however , it is strongly damped , as expected from weakly interacting density quasiparticles .",
    "this multiparticle feature is present both below and above @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath2he , in a dipolar system at high density ( e.g. @xmath46 ) the pitaevskii `` plateau '' appears to be well separated from this multiparticle continuum . similar free - particle like branch is observed in the sp spectrum @xmath1 .    based on our results",
