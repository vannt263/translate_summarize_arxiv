    "it is widely accepted that the largest fraction of matter in the universe is the dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "its nature is still unclear , but most likely it consists of yet undiscovered cold ( non - relativistic ) particles , which have very low interaction cross - sections with each other and with baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "so the main physical mechanism governing the evolution of dark matter is gravitation .    the dark matter is responsible for formation of large - scale structure of the universe , as well as extended dm haloes of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the very centers of galaxies ( except low surface brightness galaxies ) are dominated by baryons , which form galactic bulges .",
    "their influence on dm haloes consists of at least two effects .",
    "firstly , as the baryons cool and settle down in the center of a potential well created by dm , they change the common gravitational potential , which leads to compression of dm halo .",
    "this effect is called baryonic compression and increases dm density several times @xcite . on the other side",
    ", dark matter particles are scattered off by bulge stars and captured by supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , which reduces their density in the inner parts of bulges @xcite . additionally , a non - zero annihilation cross - section of dm particles also leads to decrease of dm density in the very centers of galaxies and gives possibility of indirect detection of dm through its annihilation radiation @xcite .",
    "all these issues are addressed in the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we describe previous investigations on this subject and explain motivation of this study . in the third section we present our class of initial dm halo models , which is somewhat broader than in previous papers .",
    "then the kinetic equation governing the evolution of dm is derived , along with its coefficients and boundary conditions .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to solution of the above equation , given for a series of initial halo models with inclusion of different physical processes and approximations .",
    "this helps us to clarify validity of some commonly used assumptions , and determine parameters on which the evolution depends mostly .",
    "predictions for annihilation radiation are also given in this section .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented .",
    "the question about dark matter content in central areas of galaxies has long been studied .",
    "first of all , it depends on initial structure of dm halo .",
    "there are two principal classes of methods of halo structure modelling .",
    "analytical methods generally consider the nonlinear stage of collapse of initial overdensity region .",
    "these include kinetic theory of phase mixing @xcite or variants of self - similar infall models @xcite . in general , they predict a power - law density profile in the center of a dm halo , @xmath5 where the power - law index @xmath6 is between 1 and 2 .",
    "a significant drawback of this approach is very limited ability to handle mergers , especially major ones . alternatively ,",
    "numerical simulations of dissipationless _",
    "n_body gravitational interaction have been largely used in recent years .",
    "they also generally predict density profiles that have power - law cusps in central areas ( e.g. navarro , frenk , white ( nfw ) profile @xcite with @xmath7 or moore profile @xcite with @xmath8 ) .",
    "other models were proposed in which the density slope tends to zero at @xmath9 ( einasto profiles @xcite or burkert profiles @xcite ) .",
    "there is still no consensus on the question whether dark matter halos are cuspy or cored in the centers , which means that central density profiles obtained in simulations may equally good be described with different fitting formulae , although the inferred densities in the central parsecs would vary orders of magnitude .",
    "the largest simulations of a galaxy - sized halo ( e.g. @xcite ) provide measurements of density no closer to the galaxy center than @xmath10  pc , which is still many orders of magnitude greater than the distances relevant to annihilation and scattering .    however , there are other processes that modify dark matter distribution in the galactic centers after halo formation .",
    "first of all , it is now well established that virtually all galaxies harbour supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in their centers @xcite , whose masses @xmath11 range from @xmath12 to more than @xmath13 .",
    "a black hole ( bh ) immersed in a stellar cluster ( or bulge as a whole ) modifies gravitational potential at distances smaller than the gravitational influence radius of the black hole @xmath14 , defined as containing stellar mass equal to @xmath15 .",
    "if the black hole grew adiabatically , the surrounding matter ( stars or dm ) forms a `` spike '' with power - law index @xmath16 , @xmath2 being the power - law index of density profile before black hole formation @xcite .",
    "the above argument applies for spherically symmetric evolution .",
    "if the black hole formed off - center and then spiralled in , the resulting profile should be shallower @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the hierarchical merging scenario , binary smbhs should be ubiquitous . a binary smbh ejects matter from @xmath17 due to slingshot effect , and after coalescence the stellar and dark matter density around it is reduced @xcite .",
    "however , it is unlikely that a major merger took place in the recent @xmath18  yr of milky way history @xcite .",
    "if the dm consists of self - annihilating particles , the product of annihilation cross - section @xmath19 and relative velocity @xmath20 being weakly dependent on @xmath20 , then the maximum density after a period of time @xmath21 is believed to be set at the so - called annihilation plateau : @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the particle mass ) @xcite . however , this result is exact only for circular particle orbits . if we consider arbitrary velocity anisotropy @xmath24 ( particulary , isotropic velocity corresponding to @xmath25 ) , then we obtain a weak cusp instead of a plateau : its density varies as @xmath26 and approximately equals corresponding plateau density @xmath27 at the radius where plateau itself should transform into initial density profile .",
    "this issue is explained in detail in @xcite .    finally , a very important process that modifies the dark matter distribution is the gravitational scattering of dm particles by stars in the vicinity of the smbh and capture of particles by the smbh .",
    "the detailed analysis of this process is the main subject of the present investigation .    the stellar distribution around a massive black hole was much studied in 1970s @xcite .",
    "the usual method includes representation of the distribution function ( df ) @xmath28 in terms of energy @xmath29 and angular momentum @xmath30 per unit mass ( for spherically symmetric problem these are the only two independent variables ) and consideration of diffusion in the @xmath31 phase space . in these early studies",
    "it was shown that diffusion along @xmath30 axis leads to formation of logarithmic dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath30 , so that there is continuous flux of stars towards low values of @xmath30 , where they are captured by black hole .",
    "the diffusion along @xmath29 axis drives the df to a quasi - stationary state @xmath32 , when the loss of stars is balanced by a inward flux from higher values of @xmath29 ( outside the bh sphere of influence ) . the corresponding density profile @xmath33 is called bahcall - wolf cusp , and is indeed observed in the center of our galaxy @xcite , though the density slope is somewhat lower .",
    "it is important that the stationary solution applies only to systems older than two - body relaxation time @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is 1-d velocity dispersion , @xmath36  stellar density , @xmath37  coulomb logarithm .",
    "it appears that in the center of our galaxy @xmath38 and weakly depends on radius at @xmath39 .",
    "( we adopt @xmath40 for consistency with other papers , though recent estimates are somewhat higher @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath41  pc ) .",
    "dark matter dynamics is governed by the same mechanism of relaxation on stars , but due to negligible particle mass the effect of dynamic friction is unimportant , and resulting density profile should be @xmath42 .",
    "this simple argument was considered in @xcite .",
    "a more elaborate treatment involves time - dependent solution of diffusion equation .",
    "this was first done in @xcite for a constrained initial dm distribution function using only diffusion along angular momentum . in @xcite",
    "the problem was treated as one - dimensional diffusion for energy with inclusion of loss - term due to angular momentum diffusion and capture by bh , which was taken from @xcite . in subsequent papers @xcite the effect of self - annihilations",
    "was also included .",
    "these studies have led to the conclusion that the scattering off by stars drives dm distribution towards a quasi - stationary state with diminishing amplitude of density profile due to combined effect of heating by stars and capture by the smbh .",
    "this density profile is regenerated within one @xmath1 even after a cusp has been destroyed by a binary smbh @xcite .",
    "we want to draw attention to several important issues that were not thoroughly investigated in previous studies .    1 .",
    "the relaxation time actually depends on angular momentum @xmath30 , as will be shown later . for small values of @xmath30",
    "the diffusion along energy goes faster , so that the two - dimensional problem can not be reduced to one - dimensional .",
    "2 .   the black hole mass might have grown in time , which moves up the radius of bh influence and changes relaxation timescale inside this radius .",
    "3 .   the initial dm distribution function need not be isotropic , i.e. might depend on angular momentum .",
    "all these issues are examined in the present paper .",
    "additionally , the following features are discussed :    1 .   a broad class of initial distribution functions",
    "is considered .",
    "this enables direct comparison between different studies that took different initial conditions , and helps to disentangle the effect of initial conditions from other effects investigated .",
    "the diffusion is considered both inside and outside the smbh sphere of influence .",
    "values of diffusion coefficients are different in these two domains .",
    "analytical approximations of evolution of dm density profile and distribution function are made for limiting cases of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "they are in good agreement with the solution of exact equation .",
    "the two - dimensional diffusion equation is solved directly .",
    "the results are compared to the simplified case of one - dimensional treatment , to validate the possibility of such simplification .",
    "the effect of self - annihilations is included as well .",
    "the proportion of captured , evaporated and annihilated dark matter mass is calculated .",
    "having stated these important goals , we proceed to the investigation itself .",
    "plenty of models have been suggested for dm haloes .",
    "as we are interested in dark matter dynamics in galactic centers , we shall consider only internal part of halo , which can be reasonably approximated by a power - law density profile ( [ rho_d ] ) .",
    "we operate with a distribution function @xmath45 so we need to transform @xmath46 to @xmath45 .",
    "this transformation is essentially non - unique  one can obtain different dfs for the same density profile , which differ in dependence on angular momentum @xmath30 .",
    "it is convenient to choose a factorized family of models @xmath47 , where we have changed @xmath30 for a dimensionless scaled quantity @xmath48 $ ] : @xmath49@xmath50 being angular momentum of a circular orbit with given energy .",
    "( this has been suggested in @xcite ) . in the case of power - law density @xmath51",
    "should also be power - law @xcite .",
    "we consider two family of dfs , which differ in dependence on @xmath30 :    @xmath52    model a has been proposed in @xcite as a result of analytical treatment of dm halo collapse and phase mixing .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 is related to orbital eccentricities of particles and is small , @xmath54 .",
    "( further discussion can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "model b is the simplest generalization of isotropic distribution for the case of arbitrary radial velocity anisotropy @xmath55 , considered in @xcite . here",
    "@xmath24 is binney s anisotropy parameter @xcite : systems with @xmath25 are isotropic , with @xmath56  have radially biased velocities . for realistic dm haloes ,",
    "@xmath55 in the center is zero or slightly positive @xcite , as indicated also by a density slope ",
    "anisotropy relation proposed in @xcite .    concerning the density slope",
    "@xmath6 , we shall adopt values @xmath7 ( nfw profile @xcite ) , @xmath8 ( moore profile @xcite ) and @xmath57 for the model b and @xmath58 for model a @xcite .",
    "we use nfw or moore profiles for most of our variants of calculation , since these are the most frequently used in the literature .",
    "these density profiles refer to pure dark matter haloes .",
    "the central part of a halo is likely compressed in the process of galaxy formation and baryonic contraction @xcite , which increases the slope of density profile as well as its normalization . to account for adiabatic contraction",
    ", we transform @xmath45 to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is radial action  a quantity that is conserved during slow change of potential .",
    "hence @xmath59 is conserved during compression . as the initial condition for diffusion equation we take @xmath61 converted back from @xmath59 using now the potential of stars in the bulge and the smbh .",
    "( in what follows we omit primes in @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "all calculations are performed for the case of milky way .",
    "the normalization of density profile is taken from the condition that @xmath64 , where @xmath65  kpc is the distance to galactic center , and @xmath66 @xcite . at 1 pc before contraction .",
    "] we summarize initial model data in table [ table_init_models ] .",
    ".initial halo models used in calculations .",
    "@xmath6 is the slope of density profile in the center before baryonic compression , @xmath55 is the velocity anisotropy parameter , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are density values at @xmath69  pc before and after compression , in @xmath70 . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now turn to one - dimensional diffusion for energy in the absence of loss terms .",
    "first we consider the evolution of @xmath28 in the bulge outside smbh domain of influence . in this region @xmath71 ,",
    "the initial condition has the power - law form ( [ f_init_qr ] ) : @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , and the one - dimensional equation for diffusion along energy can be solved analytically .",
    "the solution outside smbh domain of influence may be approximated as @xmath74 @xmath75 is defined to match these two asymptotes .",
    "this means that diffusion effectively blurs @xmath28 for low @xmath76 , driving it towards plateau with ever - diminishing amplitude ( as a power - law of @xmath21 ) .",
    "then we consider the vicinity of smbh , where @xmath77 .",
    "the equation then admits solution in the form @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the relaxation time ( as said above , it is independent of energy in the case considered , but still depends on @xmath80 : relaxation goes on faster for smaller angular momenta ) .",
    "if we neglect the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath80 , we may come to the following conclusion : as long as @xmath81 , the evolution of @xmath28 ( and hence density ) is only in amplitude which drops exponentially , not the shape .",
    "when the exponent becomes significant ( or @xmath82 ) , the function tends to constant value which is set by the outer boundary condition ( where it is determined by the solution outside smbh domain of influence described above ) . since the relaxation time in the inner area is always shorter than in bulge , this constant ( with respect to @xmath76 ) value is determined solely by the diffusion in bulge and is decreasing in time .",
    "the constant value of @xmath28 implies the density profile @xmath83 , as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "( this is different in the case of stars , where the effect of dynamic friction should be included in the equation , and the corresponding solution has the bahcall - wolf density profile @xmath33 ) .",
    "however , the profile is not stationary and its amplitude decreases in time ( as noted in @xcite ) , which is attributed to ongoing heating of dark matter particles by stars , continued mainly outside @xmath14 after one relaxation time .",
    "the amplitude then decreases as power - law of time : @xmath84 .",
    "we want to draw attention to the importance of considering both regions ( bulge and smbh sphere of influence ) in order to obtain the density profile and annihilation signal evolution for @xmath85 . for both cases @xmath44 and @xmath86 analytical estimates can be obtained , but for transition period @xmath87 exact calculation is required .",
    "specifically , galactic center is just in this category .",
    "thus far we have considered only one - dimensional approximations , with the diffusion along angular momentum caused by capture of dm particles by the black hole , and diffusion along energy caused by heating on stars . a common approach to solution of the two - dimensional equation",
    "is to consider one - dimensional diffusion along energy with additional loss term due to capture of particles by black hole , caused by diffusion along momentum .",
    "the loss term is taken from the stationary solution of diffusion equation for momentum , and introduced into the equation for energy as an additional term @xmath88 .",
    "the equation itself is written for averaged @xmath89 .",
    "the magnitude of the loss term @xmath88 is taken from the boundary condition at the black hole : @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is related to @xmath92 by ( [ f_near_rg ] ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath93 also should be averaged over @xmath80 , despite the fact that it significantly varies with @xmath80 ( see ( [ diff_coefs]a ) ) .",
    "the validity of this reduction should therefore be verified by comparison with solution of full two - dimensional equation , which was one of aims of the present study .      in order to address different issues mentioned in section  [ sec_overview ]",
    ", we have performed several variants of calculation , which differ in initial conditions and in account for distinct factors of evolution .",
    "all of them are listed in table  [ table_variants ] .",
    "the full two - dimensional diffusion equation ( [ diff_eq ] ) was integrated on rectangular grid with variable space- and time - steps .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath94 was treated in the same way as in @xcite ( section vc ) , i.e. for @xmath95 less than @xmath96 ( the size of first cell ) , flux @xmath88 through absorption boundary was considered as flux through @xmath97 , which was related to the value of @xmath28 in the center of the cell via ( [ f_near_rg ] ) with @xmath98 .",
    "the spatial density profile was recalculated every few timesteps and used to compute orbit - averaged annihilation rate at each @xmath99 in variants 2 and 5 .",
    "the variants are chosen to investigate the relative role of different factors .",
    "five different initial models were chosen ( sec .",
    "[ sec_initmodels ] ) .",
    "the model b3 ( nfw profile with isotropic velocity distribution ) is a basic model to study the influence the one - dimensional approximation ( var.6 ) and growing bh mass ( var.7 ) , which are to be compared with reference var.4 . from the existence of quasars at @xmath100 @xcite",
    "we know that smbhs were already massive at very early times , but the situation is also possible when the black hole grows slowly from small initial seed due to accretion of stars and gas .",
    "the growth law is taken to be @xmath101 @xcite ; the smbh radius of influence and the total gravitational potential are changed accordingly . in other variants @xmath11",
    "was held constant , and gravitational potential remained fixed .",
    "the influence of velocity anisotropy is studied in var.3 for moore profile ( from the @xmath102 relation of @xcite it is naturally to expect more radial anisotropy for steeper profiles ) , which should be compared to var.1 .",
    "additionally , annihilation was accounted for in vars.2 and 5 , with maximal annihilation cross - section of @xmath103 and particle mass @xmath104  gev , same as in @xcite .",
    "these should be compared to vars.1 and 4 , respectively .",
    "in other variants annihilation was disregarded , but predictions of @xmath2-ray flux were made ( see below ) .",
    "the prospects of indirect dm detection are related to registration of @xmath2-rays from the dm annihilation in the most dense regions .",
    "one of such sites is the galactic center , where indeed a @xmath2-ray source was detected by several ground - based cherenkov telescopes such as h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , veritas @xcite , cangaroo @xcite and magic @xcite , as well as space telescope egret @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-ray flux is usually split into two factors , one of them depending on particle physics parameters and the other ( @xmath105  astrophysical factor ) is determined by dm density distribution @xcite .",
    "@xmath106 where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is dimensionless integral of squared density , averaged over a solid angle @xmath109 : @xmath110 @xmath111 , and integral is taken over line of sight and the solid angle corresponding to telescope resolution .",
    "( for simplicity , the point - spread function is taken as heaviside step function ) .",
    "we calculate values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 corresponding to @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the former is the approximate resolution of glast @xcite and modern cherenkov telescopes such as hess , the latter is the resolution of egret @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution is 15 and 150 pc , correspondingly .",
    "it is obvious that for a power - law density profile @xmath116 with @xmath117 the main contribution in ( [ j_av ] ) comes from the inner boundary , and for @xmath118 the situation is inverse . since we have adiabatically compressed dark matter halo , its density slope @xmath119 after contraction is always greater than 1.5 ( @xmath120 , where @xmath2 is initial slope )",
    "therefore , the flux is determined by dark matter distribution in the vicinity of black hole , and the additional contribution from the dark matter in bulge ( @xmath121 ) is negligible .",
    "this is in contrast with the conclusion of @xcite , where the authors did not use adiabatically contracted dark matter profile and hence the contribution from bulge was significant because @xmath118 .",
    "another observational constraint on dark matter distribution may come from the study of stellar orbits which measure the enclosed mass and may help to determine the fraction of dark mass near the smbh @xcite .",
    "@xmath122    @xmath123    @xmath124    the results of calculation are presented in table  [ table_variants ] .",
    "the five initial models differ in normalization , i.e. in the initial dark matter mass @xmath125 within @xmath14 .",
    "since the dynamics of dark matter is governed by linear equations ( except for annihilation ) , the results may well be scaled to match each other .",
    "the similarity between different models then becomes apparent .",
    "approximately 1015% of @xmath125 is captured by black hole by @xmath126  yr ( @xmath127 ) ; half of this mass comes from the smbh sphere of influence ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "about 40% of @xmath125 has been evaporated from the central region .",
    "the difference between variants with the same initial model are significant only for @xmath129  yr , which is by coincidence the total time of evolution .",
    "@xmath1 ( [ t_relax ] ) is the relaxation time inside @xmath14 and is independent of radius .",
    "so the current state ( and further evolution ) is basically independent of initial conditions , although if @xmath1 was , say , twice as large , then the difference would be much more prominent by present time .",
    "first we consider basic variant 4 without annihilation .",
    "since the diffusion along energy goes on faster for low angular momenta , the particles with both low energy and low angular momenta are quickly heated up or captured by black hole , therefore the density in the immediate vicinity of the black hole quickly drops .",
    "however , by one relaxation time it decreases roughly by the same factor of few in the whole region @xmath130 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_dens_annihil ] , upper solid ) , except for the very inner radii . by this time",
    "the density profile is still steeper than @xmath131 inside @xmath14 , and hence the integral @xmath132 which determines the @xmath133-factor in ( [ j_av ] ) depends on the low-@xmath134 density behavior .",
    "then the heating starts to dominate , and within few @xmath1 the distribution function and density tend to nearly universal form : for @xmath135 density @xmath136 , near @xmath137 density profile is a little bit shallower , and further away it is identical to initial profile .",
    "so most of @xmath133 is gained at @xmath137 , and hence the difference between variants @xmath138 almost vanishes . the density profile",
    "inside @xmath14 then drops nearly self - similarly ( if we continue integration to @xmath139  yrs , density is reduced about an order of magnitude everywhere at @xmath39 while retaining its form ) .",
    "it is important to note that after this regime has been established , diffusion _ outside _ smbh sphere of influence plays the key role .    in the models with initial dominance of low angular momentum orbits ( b2 and a1 )",
    "the initial flux of dark matter into the smbh is larger , but then as the @xmath80-diffusion establishes near - logarithmic profile ( at @xmath4 ) , the memory of initial conditions is erased .",
    "@xmath140    @xmath141    the inclusion of self - annihilation ( in vars .",
    "2 and 5 ) affects only the inner region in the manner that the density does not exceed the `` annihilation weak cusp '' ( not plateau ) .",
    "consequently , the @xmath133 value diminishes faster than without annihilation ( fig .",
    "[ fig_j ] ) , but after @xmath4 the heating starts to prevail over annihilation even in the very inner region , and everything again goes as in basic variant .",
    "the variant 7 which features a black hole growing from small initial seed differs in the way that relaxation time inside @xmath14 is less and a nearly self - similar relaxed solution is established earlier . in this case",
    "the total dark matter mass captured by the black hole is also less than in the case of constant black hole mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mcapt ] ) . in all variants",
    "the total captured mass is much less than @xmath11 , so the neglect of the absorption on the black hole mass is justified .",
    "finally , comparison of one - dimensional solution ( var.6 ) to the two - dimensional one ( var.4 ) reveals very little difference in either final result or dynamics .",
    "this is because @xmath80-profile of distribution function at fixed @xmath76 is reasonably well described by a logarithm , failing only at very early ( @xmath43 ) or intermediate ( @xmath142 ) times ( fig .",
    "[ fig_fr ] ) .",
    "therefore , the commonly used approach of reduction to one - dimensional diffusion equation is a good approximation , at least for the class of initial distribution functions that have weak dependency on @xmath80 ( the case of velocity isotropy  model b3  being in this class ) .",
    "moreover , the evolution of @xmath80-averaged distribution function is qualitatively consistent with simple analytical description of section  [ sec_onedim ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig_fq ] ) .",
    "we have considered the evolution of dark matter distribution in the galactic center caused by gravitational scattering on stars of galactic bulge , absorption by the supermassive black hole and annihilation .",
    "the spherically symmetric evolution is described by two - dimensional fokker - planck equation in phase space of energy and angular momentum .",
    "one of main goals was to investigate how the difference in initial conditions and in various dynamical factors affects the final result .",
    "it turns out that at least for our galaxy there has been enough time to eliminate most of the differences and to establish a nearly universal distribution and density profile with the following features : for @xmath143  pc the density is close to power - law @xmath144 with slope @xmath145 or less , farther out the slope becomes shallower , and even farther it joins the initial profile which is already steeper than @xmath131 because of adiabatic compression in the bulge .",
    "therefore , as regarding the possible annihilation signal , after approximately four relaxation times it is determined by dm distribution near @xmath14 and depends only on initial profile normalization , not the details of evolution .",
    "this explains the low scatter in @xmath133 values in the last column of table  [ table_variants ] , the most probable range for @xmath146 being @xmath147 .",
    "( this is in moderate agreement with results of @xcite , though in our calculations the difference between models with no annihilation and maximal annihilation is much smaller ) .",
    "the low scatter in @xmath105 means that constraints on the microphysical nature of dark matter following from eq.([phi_signal ] ) will be more robust , if the @xmath2-ray flux detected from the galactic center is at least partially attributed to dark matter annihilation @xcite",
    ".    the different initial models also demonstrate similar proportions of dark matter mass that has been captured by the black hole ( @xmath148 ) and evaporated from the central 2 pc ( @xmath149 of the initial dm mass within 2 pc ) .",
    "a number of previous studies suggested that the dm may constitute a significant fraction of the total smbh mass .",
    "however , in these papers either the loss cone was assumed to be always full @xcite , or the diffusion along energy axis ( heating ) was disregarded @xcite , which led to higher estimate of the captured mass compared to the present study .",
    "it remains in question whether a non - spherically - symmetric initial distribution could sustain a full `` loss cone '' due to chaotic randomization of orbits @xcite .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "comparison with paper @xcite where 1-d equation was solved shows qualitatively similar behavior of @xmath80-averaged distribution function and density evolution : for @xmath150 the density drops self - similarly in the smbh region of influence , and for @xmath151 it tends to @xmath152 form .",
    "the quantitative difference might be attributed to different stellar density profile outside @xmath153 : the evolution in the transition spatial ( @xmath154 ) and temporal ( @xmath155 ) regions essentially depends on the magnitude of diffusion coefficients which are determined by stellar density .",
    "there are other targets of indirect dark matter search , except the galactic center , such as nearby galaxies or globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the importance of the processes discussed in this paper on the @xmath2-ray flux from these other targets depends on whether they are dynamically old , i.e. is their relaxation time in the very center less than hubble time . for example , dark matter dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies such as draco have relaxation times well exceeding @xmath18  yr , so the scattering off by stars is unimportant , and the flux is determined by initial conditions and annihilation cross - section @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "globular clusters such as g1 in andromeda galaxy are dynamically old , and are expected to be on the relaxed stage of evolution and therefore have less scatter in @xmath105 , hence they are also promising in constraining dark matter parameters @xcite .",
    "( however , in this case one should account for evolution of stellar distribution as well ) .",
    "finally , galaxies on the intermediate stage of evolution such as m32 which has central relaxation time of order @xmath156  yr @xcite may exhibit very different values of @xmath105 ( a drop by many orders of magnitude during several @xmath1 is seen on fig .  [ fig_j ] ) .",

    "<S> the evolution of dark matter in central areas of galaxies is considered ( the milky way is taken as an example ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is driven by scattering off of dark matter particles by bulge stars , their absorption by the supermassive black hole and self - annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> this process is described by diffusion equation in the phase space of energy and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the equation was integrated for several different models of initial dark matter distribution and using various assumptions about the dynamical factors . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that because the milky way center is rather dynamically old ( @xmath0 relaxation times @xmath1 ) , the difference in initial conditions almost vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the density attains a nearly universal profile , and the @xmath2-ray flux from dark matter annihilation lies in rather narrow range , which enables more robust determination of the dark matter parameters . by present time </S>",
    "<S> the mass of dark matter inside the black hole sphere of influence ( @xmath3  pc ) has been reduced approximately twice , mostly because of heating by stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the dynamics of dark matter for @xmath4 is determined mainly by stars outside the sphere of influence . </S>"
