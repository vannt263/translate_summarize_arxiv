    "more concretely , orient each edge @xmath277 by projecting the orientation on @xmath278 down to @xmath255 , where @xmath279 is any branch of @xmath250 with @xmath280 ; unidirectionality implies that this construction is well - defined .",
    "then we simply define a half - branch @xmath281 to be outgoing at a switch @xmath239 if the orientation of @xmath282 coming from @xmath255 points away from @xmath239 , and similarly for incoming branches .",
    "note that this is well - defined , in that two half - branches incident to the same switch in distinct germs will be assigned opposing directional classes .",
    "this rule then defines an assignment of direction for all half branches of @xmath62 as follows .",
    "the half branches of @xmath62 which are not contained in @xmath276 can be partitioned disjointly into two subcollections : the _ frontier _ half branches ( those which are incident to a switch contained in @xmath276 ) , and the @xmath283 half branches ( those for which the incident switch is not contained in @xmath276 ) . once directions have been assigned to the half branches of @xmath276 as above ,",
    "directions for frontier half branches are determined by which germ they belong to at the corresponding switch . for interior half branches , simply assign the original directions coming from @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath284 denote the switches of @xmath62 contained in @xmath276 , and recall that @xmath240 denotes the row vector of @xmath220 corresponding to the switch @xmath238 .",
    "the vector @xmath285 is a non - zero integer vector , all of whose coordinates are non - negative .",
    "since every branch of @xmath276 is mixed , each component of @xmath286 corresponding to a branch of @xmath276 is @xmath41 .",
    "the same is true for any branch not in @xmath276 which does not contain a frontier half - branch .",
    "we claim that frontier half branches must be incoming at the switch contained in @xmath287 to which it is incident ; this will imply that @xmath286 takes on a positive value for each component corresponding to a branch containing a frontier half branch .",
    "indeed , let @xmath255 be a branch containing a frontier half branch , and let @xmath288 be incident to @xmath255 .",
    "@xmath289 implies that there is another branch @xmath282 incident to @xmath239 such that @xmath282 is a branch of @xmath276 and @xmath282 is incoming at @xmath239 .",
    "thus if @xmath255 were outgoing at @xmath239 , there would exist a train path emanating from @xmath269 which traverses @xmath255 , by contatenating the train path starting at @xmath269 and ending at @xmath282 with the train path connecting @xmath282 to @xmath255 over @xmath239 .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that @xmath290 .",
    "thus to complete the argument it suffices to show that the collection of frontier half branches is non - empty . recall that @xmath159 is an invisible branch , and is therefore not contained in any closed train path",
    "it then follows that the half branch of @xmath159 incident to @xmath269 is frontier .",
    "we now use the following elementary fact regarding train tracks on @xmath0 , ( see @xcite for proof ) :    let @xmath291 be a train track . then @xmath292 @xmath293    therefore , there are at most @xmath294 row vectors of @xmath220 in the sum @xmath286 . furthermore , since the components of @xmath286 are all non - negative integers , @xmath295    where @xmath296 denotes the standard euclidean dot product . on the other hand , assuming the validity of @xmath297 , one obtains    @xmath298 @xmath299    a contradiction .",
    "in this section , we will use theorems @xmath204 and @xmath300 to establish the following effective version of masur and minsky s @xcite nesting lemma :    there exists a function @xmath301 such that if @xmath178 and @xmath62 are large train tracks and @xmath178 is carried by @xmath62 , and @xmath302 , then @xmath303    when convenient , we will assume our train tracks to be generic ; as mentioned in @xcite , the proof of the nesting lemma in the generic case is easily extendable to the general setting .    if @xmath304 , define the _ combinatorial length _ of @xmath305 with respect to @xmath62 , @xmath306 , to be the integral of @xmath305 over @xmath141 , that is @xmath307 we also define @xmath308 where the minimum is taken over all tracks @xmath309 carrying @xmath305 .",
    "we will need the following lemma , as seen in hammenstdt @xcite :    let @xmath155 be a simple closed curve carried by a train track @xmath62 .",
    "then the counting measure on @xmath155 is a vertex cycle of @xmath62 if and only if , for any branch @xmath159 of @xmath62 , the image of @xmath155 under its corresponding carrying map traverses @xmath159 at most twice , and never twice in the same direction .",
    "since the vertex cycles are the extreme points of @xmath147 , by the classical krein - milman theorem , any projective transverse measure class can be written as a convex combination of vertex cycles ; that is , given @xmath310 , there exists @xmath311 such that    @xmath312    where @xmath313 are the vertex cycles of @xmath62 .",
    "any train track on @xmath0 has at most @xmath314 branches , and therefore by lemma @xmath315 , if @xmath62 is any train track and @xmath199 is a vertex cycle , @xmath316 lemma @xmath315 also implies that any train track @xmath62 has at most @xmath317 vertex cycles , since any branch is traversed once , twice , or no times .",
    "we therefore conclude that , given @xmath151 as in equation [ 3.1 ] , @xmath318 \\max_{i } a_{i}\\ ] ]    @xmath319    given @xmath320 , there exists a function @xmath321 such that if @xmath322 and @xmath323 , then @xmath324 .",
    "suppose @xmath323 .",
    "we will abuse notation and refer to the image of @xmath199 under its carrying map by @xmath199 .",
    "then every time @xmath199 traverses a branch of @xmath62 , by lemma @xmath315 , it can intersect a vertex cycle at most twice . therefore",

    "however , @xmath331 and therefore for sufficiently large @xmath332 this is not an issue .",
    "suppose @xmath178 is a large recurrent train track carried by @xmath62 on @xmath0 , and let @xmath333 such that @xmath334 is carried by @xmath149 .",
    "then the total number of times , counting multiplicity , that branches of @xmath334 traverse any branch of @xmath335 is bounded above by @xmath336 .",
    "the complete argument can be found in masur and minsky s original paper @xcite on the hyperbolicity of the curve complex . for our purposes and for the sake of brevity",
    ", it suffices here to simply remark that they show any given branch of @xmath334 can only traverse branches of @xmath335 at most twice .",
    "then , since any track has less than @xmath337 branches , the result follows .    to prove the following lemma",
    ", we use the results from section @xmath63 :    there exists @xmath338 with @xmath339    such that if @xmath340 and @xmath178 is large and @xmath62 is generic , @xmath304 and every branch @xmath159 of @xmath341 and @xmath342 of @xmath178 satisfies @xmath343 , then @xmath344 , and @xmath178 is recurrent .",
    "we follow masur and minsky s original argument @xcite .",
    "the main tools are the elementary moves on train tracks called _ splitting _ and _ shifting _ as introduced in section @xmath65 ( see figures @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , which can be used to take @xmath62 to a diagonal extension of @xmath178 . in order to do this , we need to move any branch of @xmath341 into a corner of a complementary region of @xmath178 . a split or a shift applied to any such branch either reduces the number of branches of @xmath341 incident to a given branch of @xmath178 , or decreases the distance between a branch of @xmath345 and a corner of a complementary region of @xmath178 .",
    "thus , a bounded number of such moves produces a track carried by a diagonal extension of @xmath178 .",
    "if a splitting is performed involving a branch @xmath159 of @xmath341 and a branch @xmath155 of @xmath178 , the resulting track contains a new branch @xmath346 of @xmath178 , and we can extend @xmath305 to @xmath346 to be consistent with the switch conditions by assigning @xmath347 .",
    "in particular , a sufficient condition for being able to define @xmath305 on the new track is    @xmath348    there are at most @xmath337 branches of @xmath341 , and at most @xmath337 branches of @xmath178 or @xmath62 .",
    "as earlier mentioned , a splitting move either reduces the number of branches of @xmath341 incident to @xmath178 , or it reduces the number of edges of @xmath178 between a given branch of @xmath345 and a corner that it faces .",
    "once a branch of @xmath345 is separated by a corner of a complementary region of @xmath178 by only edges of @xmath178 for which no splitting moves can be performed , a shift move takes such an edge to a corner point .",
    "therefore , each edge of @xmath345 is taken to a corner of @xmath178 after no more than @xmath349 shiftings and splittings , and therefore we obtain @xmath149 after at most @xmath350 such moves .",
    "now , let @xmath351 , and assume that for this value of @xmath15 , the hypothesis of the statement is satisfied . in light of equation",
    "[ 4.5 ] , @xmath305 is definable on the diagonal extension @xmath149 we obtain after splitting and shifting as long as    @xmath352    which is precisely what the hypothesis of lemma @xmath353 implies .",
    "therefore , @xmath305 is extendable to a diagonal extension of @xmath178 such that all branches receive positive weights , hence @xmath344 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath178 is recurrent ; suppose not .",
    "let @xmath354 denote the branch set of @xmath178 .",
    "then theorem @xmath300 implies that if @xmath355 is a vector with all positive coordinates ,    @xmath356    in light of equation @xmath353 , the vector @xmath305 has small deviations , since @xmath305 satisfies the switch conditions on @xmath178 , up to the additive error coming from the weight it assigns to any branch of @xmath341 , which is less than    @xmath357    since we assumed that @xmath62 is generic , there are at most two branches of @xmath345 incident to any branch of @xmath178 , and therefore the deviations of @xmath305 are all less than @xmath358 , contradicting theorem @xmath300 .",
    "let @xmath320 be given .",
    "then there exist functions @xmath359 and @xmath360 satisfying the following : if @xmath178 is large and carried by @xmath62 and @xmath361 such that @xmath149 carries @xmath334 , and if @xmath362 , then any simple closed curve @xmath200 carried on @xmath334 can be written in @xmath363 as @xmath364 , and such that @xmath365 @xmath366    the details of the argument are not entirely relevant for the proof of our main theorem , and can be found in masur - minsky @xcite ; therefore we omit the particulars of the proof , and remark only that in their argument , masur and minsky show that it suffices to take @xmath367 where @xmath368 is the constant from equation [ 3.3 ] , @xmath369 is the constant from the statement of lemma @xmath370 , @xmath371 is a bound on the weights that a vertex cycle can place on any one branch of @xmath334 ( and therefore it suffices to take @xmath372 by lemma @xmath315 ) , and @xmath373 is a bound on the combinatorial length of any vertex cycle on any train track on @xmath0 . putting all of this together , we obtain @xmath374 ( 3(36g+12p-36)^{2})\\ ] ] @xmath375 as claimed .",
    "they also show that it suffices to take @xmath376 where @xmath377 is a bound on the curve graph distance between any two vertex cycles of the same train track .",
