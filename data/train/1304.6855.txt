    "the pure models for crystalline materials can describe the respective experimental samples in exceptional situations , since such a sample can contain impurities , broken bonds , defects , etc . , making real physical systems to never be translationally invariant , thus necessitating the modification of pure models appropriately for comparing the experimental results with the theoretical predictions . a small amount of quenched randomness can influence significantly the phase transitions replacing a first - order phase transition ( fopt ) by a second - order phase transition ( sopt ) , so that tricritical points and critical - end - points are suppressed @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "an infinitesimal amount of field randomness destroys any fopt .",
    "one such situation is the presence of random magnetic fields acting on each spin in an otherwise free of defects lattice ; the respective pure system is considered to be described by an ising model , which is now transformed into the random field ising model ( rfim ) in the presence of random fields @xcite .",
    "rfim had been the standard vehicle for studying the effects of quenched randomness on phase diagrams and critical properties of lattice spin - systems and had been studied for many years since the seminal work of imry and ma @xcite .",
    "associated with this model are the notions of lower critical dimension , tricritical points , higher order critical points and random - field probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the simplest model exhibiting a tricritical phase diagram in the absence of randomness is the blume - capel model  a regular ising spin-@xmath7 model @xcite .",
    "although much effort has been invested for the study of the rfim , the only well - established conclusion is the existence of a phase transition for @xmath8 ( d space dimension ) , that is , the critical lower dimension @xmath9 is 2 after a long controversial discussion @xcite , while many other issues are still unanswered ; among them is the order of the phase transition , the existence of a tricritical point ( tcp ) and the dependence of these on the form of the random field pdf .",
    "according to the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) the choice of the random field pdf can lead to a continuous ferromagnetic / paramagnetic ( fm / pm ) boundary as in the single gaussian , whereas for the bimodal this boundary can be divided into two parts , an sopt branch for high temperatures and an fopt branch for low temperatures separated by a tcp at @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the coordination number , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 are the tricritical temperature and random field , respectively , such that for @xmath15 and @xmath16 the transition to the fm phase is of first order .",
    "however , this behavior is not fully elucidated since in the case of the three dimensional rfim , the high temperature series expansions yield only continuous transitions for both pdf s @xcite ; according to houghton et al @xcite both distributions predict a tricritical point with @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the bimodal and @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the gaussian with critical standard deviation @xmath21 .",
    "galam and birman studied the crucial issue for the existence of a tcp within the mean - field theory for a general pdf @xmath22 by using an even - degree free energy expansion up to eighth degree in the order parameter ; they proposed some inequalities between the derivatives of the pdf up to sixth order at zero magnetic field for the possible existence of a tcp @xcite . in monte carlo studies for @xmath23 , machta et al @xcite , using the gaussian distribution ,",
    "could not reach a definite conclusion concerning the nature of the transition , since for some realizations of randomness the magnetization histogram was two - peaked ( implying an sopt ) whereas for other ones was three - peaked implying an fopt ; middleton and fisher @xcite , using a similar distribution for @xmath24 , suggested an sopt with a small order - parameter exponent @xmath25 ; fytas et al @xcite , following wang - landau and lee entropic sampling schemes for the bimodal distribution function with @xmath26 and @xmath27 for a simple cubic lattice , concluded that their results indicated an sopt by applying the lee - kosterlitz free energy barrier method ; hern@xmath28ndez and coworkers claim they have found a crossover between an sopt and an fopt at a finite temperature and magnetic field for the bimodal distribution function @xcite .",
    "one of the main issues was the experimental realization of random fields .",
    "fishman and aharony @xcite showed that the randomly quenched exchange interactions ising antiferromagnet in a uniform field @xmath29 is equivalent to a ferromagnet in a random field with the strength of the random field linearly proportional to the induced magnetization . also another interesting result found by galam @xcite via mfa was that the ising antiferromagnets in a uniform field with either a general random site exchange or site dilution have the same multicritical space as the random - field ising model with bimodal pdf .",
    "the usual pdf for the random field is either the symmetric bimodal    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the fraction of lattice sites having a magnetic field @xmath5 , while the rest fraction has a field @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite , or the gaussian , single or double symmetric ,    @xmath34              \\nonumber   \\\\ p(h_{i } ) & = & \\frac{1}{2 }   \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi \\sigma^{2})^{1/2 } } \\left\\{exp\\left[-\\frac{(h_{i}-h_{0})^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right ] + exp\\left[-\\frac{(h_{i}+h_{0})^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{sexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with mean value zero and ( @xmath35 ) , respectively , and standard deviation @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "galam and aharony , in a series of investigations , presented a detailed analysis via mean field and renormalization group of a system consisting of @xmath37component classical spins ( finally choosing @xmath38 ) on a @xmath39dimensional lattice of a uniaxially anisotropic ferromagnet in a longitudinal random field extracted from a symmetric bimodal pdf ( @xmath40 ) without and with a uniform magnetic field along the easy axis , respectively @xcite .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy was chosen to be along the easy axis and the exchange couplings were of the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the anisotropy and @xmath43 .",
    "depending on the anisotropy ( small , medium , large ) a variety of phases ( longitudinal , transverse , paramagnetic ) , critical , bicritical , critical - end points as well as a multicritical point ( an intersection of bicritical , tricritical and critical - end - point lines ) resulted .",
    "in addition to these purely theoretical investigations , galam , proposed a model ( diluted random field ) in his attempt to reproduce some of the features in the phase diagram of the experimental sample consisting of the mixed cyanide crystals @xmath44 , where @xmath45 stands for an alkali metal ( k , na , rb ) and @xmath46 a spherical halogen ion ( br , cl , i ) ; the dilution of the pure crystal @xmath47 is achieved by replacing @xmath48 by the halogen ions @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the pure alkali - cyanide @xmath47 crystal ferroelastic transition disappears at some concentration @xmath49 of the cyanide ; its numerical value depends on both components @xmath50 . by choosing a model hamiltonian ( ferromagnetic ising - type with nearest neighbor interaction ) with dilution and a symmetric trimodal pdf for the random fields , galam , using mfa , managed to predict the involved first and second order phase transitions with the interfering tcp as well as the respective concentration for a phase transition to occur depending on the procedure considered .",
    "the random fields were necessary because there were experimental evidences that below @xmath49 cyanide displayed orientational freezing and the random fields were used for fixing this orientation .",
    "the involved probability @xmath51 in pdf as well as the critical threshold @xmath49 were expressed in terms of microscopic quantities .",
    "recently , the asymmetric bimodal pdf ( [ bimodalp ] ) with @xmath52 , in general , has also been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "this study has revealed that for some values of @xmath31 and @xmath5 the pm / fm boundary is exclusively of second order ; however , for some other ranges of these variables this boundary consists of two branches , a second order one and another of first order , thus confirming the existence of a tricritical point , whose temperature depends only on the probability @xmath31 in ( [ bimodalp ] ) .",
    "in addition to these findings , the occurrence of reentrance has been corroborated as well as complex magnetization profiles with respect the random field strength @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath53 , symmetric bimodal pdf , the results found by aharony were confirmed @xcite .",
    "an immediate generalization of the asymmetric bimodal ( [ bimodalp ] ) is the asymmetric trimodal one ,    @xmath54    where @xmath3 . in earlier studies ,",
    "the probabilities @xmath6 had been considered as equal and related to @xmath55 by the relation @xmath56 , symmetric pdf @xcite .",
    "the third - peak , introduced in addition the other two ones in the bimodal ( [ bimodalp ] ) and associated with the third term in ( [ trimodal ] ) , is to allow for the presence of non magnetic spins or vacancies in the lattice that are not affected by the random magnetic fields and reduces the randomness of the system , as well .    for the critical exponents of the three - dimensional rfim",
    ", it seems that there is broad consensus concerning their values except for the specific heat exponent @xmath57 , for which there is much dispute concerning its numerical value , since its sign is widely accepted to be negative .",
    "the main source of information for the critical exponents are monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , they provide various values depending on the probability distribution considered .",
    "middleton and fisher concluded that the @xmath57-exponent is near zero , @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "rieger and young , considering the bimodal distribution , found @xmath59 @xcite , rieger , using the single gaussian distribution , found @xmath60 @xcite , whereas hartmann and young , in ground - state calculations , found @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "however , in the current case the presence of random fields enhances fluctuations causing the critical region to be wider than the one due only to the thermal fluctuations @xcite and the upper critical dimension is increased by @xmath141 to @xmath280 .",
    "our results indicate that on increasing the complexity of the model system new phenomena can be revealed as in the current case of including asymmetry in the pdf ; this inclusion induces drastic changes on the phase diagram , such as reentrance and two tcps , thus confirming the necessity of treating the partial probabilities @xmath281 of the pdf in the most general aspect to get the complete phase diagram .",
