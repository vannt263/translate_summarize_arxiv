    "in @xcite , billera used methods of homological and commutative algebra to solve a conjecture of strang on the dimension of the space of @xmath8 splines on a generic planar simplicial complex . the algebraic approach to the study of splines was further developed in work of billera and rose @xcite , @xcite , and schenck and stillman @xcite , @xcite . for a ( not necessarily generic ) triangulation @xmath9 of a simply connected polygonal domain having @xmath10 interior edges and @xmath11 interior vertices , alfeld and schumaker showed that for @xmath12 , the dimension of the vector space @xmath13 of splines on @xmath9 having smoothness @xmath2 and degree at most @xmath3 is given by :    .1 in @xmath14 .1 in where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the number of distinct slopes at an interior vertex @xmath18 .    in higher dimensions , a spectral sequence argument @xcite shows that the previous theorem continues to hold , in the sense that for @xmath19 , the dimension of @xmath13 is given by a polynomial in @xmath3 ( the _ hilbert polynomial _ ) , and the coefficients of the three largest terms of this polynomial are determined by a higher dimensional analog of the formula given by alfeld and schumaker in the planar case .",
    "in this note , we study splines on a _ polyhedral _ complex @xmath1 . in general , polyhedral complexes do not lend themselves to the full range of techniques available in the simplicial case , and so have been studied less . in @xcite , schumaker obtains upper and lower bounds in the planar case , and in @xcite , billera and rose obtained the first two coefficients of the hilbert polynomial .",

    "our key technical innovation is a refined version of the dual graph , depending on a choice of codimension@xmath7 linear space ; used in conjunction with localization techniques .",
    "the main result of this paper is a formula for the third coefficient of the hilbert polynomial , in the case of a polyhedral complex . in particular , for a planar polyhedral complex , our result gives a formula for the dimension of @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
