    "unification of all fundamental forces in nature has represented a difficult task along the last few decades .",
    "the most promising models are encoded within the context of string theory .",
    "for instance , there are models in heterotic string theories in which grand unifications theories are present , while in type ii superstring theories , partial unification is an available option in several model - dependent scenarios , where there exists the possibility to study geometric aspects of general relativity at the microscopic level ( see @xcite and references therein ) . + in order to construct effective four - dimensional theories with a minimal ( non - zero ) number of supersymmetric generators , critical type ii superstrings are typically compactified on calabi - yau ( cy ) threefolds , which break three - quarters of the total supersymmetry . roughly speaking ,",
    "this follows from the fact that , in the absence of other supergravity fields , the ten - dimensional gravitino satisfies the constraint @xmath0 , implying the presence of two four - dimensional covariantly constant spinors . under these fluxless conditions",
    ", it is possible to construct a maximally symmetric four - dimensional theory ( minkowski , de sitter or anti - de sitter ) .",
    "however , fluxless compactification scenarios suffer from the moduli stabilization problem .",
    "+ moduli are stabilized , once one includes fluxes in the compactification process .",
    "nevertheless , fluxes back - react and their presence modifies the internal geometry , forcing us to depart from the nice and smooth cy geometry .",
    "even more , the presence of fluxes contributes to the ten - dimensional gravitino variation by @xmath1 where @xmath2 encodes the flux contributions : it vanishes in the fluxless case .",
    "notice however , that to preserve two supersymmetries in the effective four - dimensional theory , the variation of the gravitino must vanish , implying that the four - dimensional component of the supersymmetric parameter is not covariantly constant with respect to the levi - civita equation , but with respect to a connection with torsion .",
    "it is then clear that , the effective four - dimensional supergravity theories obtained from the compactification process , must be different from the theories constructed in the fluxless case .",
    "such effective theories receive the name of _ gauged supergravities_. for more details , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ one interesting question , concerns the existence of spherically symmetric solutions in the context of gauged supergravities @xcite-@xcite and in particular , the specific case in which a kalb - ramond ( kr ) three - form flux is extended in the effective four - dimensional space - time .",
    "the presence of kr fluxes implies the study of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds with torsion @xcite .",
    "torsion appears as an antisymmetric tensorial piece in the christoffel connection symbol in einstein - cartan ( ec ) theory .",
    "the simplest level of torsion theory can provide a classical background for quantum matter fields and a relationship with spin @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is important since , an alternative way to study geometric aspects of general relativity at the microscopic level , is given by the ec theory @xcite , which is characterized by the presence of a spin angular momentum in addition to the mass .",
    "the main task to include torsion in space - time is to unify gravity with electromagnetism at a microscopic level , where matter formations are performed by elementary particles .",
    "+ torsion can be incorporated as well into the classical solutions of einstein equations , through a non - symmetric part of the kr metric , which in turns reduces to the effective antisymmetric two - index potential @xmath3 .",
    "the field strength of @xmath4 has in general , a gauge invariant coupling with the electromagnetic field , leading to significant effects on many cosmological and astrophysical phenomena @xcite-@xcite . +",
    "a complete understanding of torsion phenomena in the ec theory require appropriate knowledge of the various solutions of the gravitational field equations in space - times under various circumstances .",
    "several cases have been studied in the last few years .",
    "for instance , in @xcite sengrupta and sur obtained the first known solution of einstein equations in a space - time with torsion ( effectively induced by the presence of a four - dimensional kr field ) , corresponding to a static and spherically symmetric solution .",
    "later on , in @xcite , an approximate asymptotic solution was studied , to analyze the gravitational lensing and the perihelion precession , and more over , it was shown that this solution represents a wormhole model for a real kr field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ there are important progress in literature about the physical implications on the possible existence of torsion .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was reported tight bounds on many components of the torsion tensor ( mixed - symmetry , trace and axial components ) using the high - precision data from masers and torsion pendulums .",
    "see also @xcite for an improvement on the constraints on the axial components .",
    "+ motivated by this , our goal in this paper is to explore the possible existence of an evolving ( time - dependent ) spherically symmetric solution of the gravitational field equations ( kr space - time ) in presence of torsion .",
    "this means we shall start up with an effective four - dimensional action with a torsion component in the sense of einstein - cartan theory .",
    "the torsion component is given by the presence of a three - form flux which in turn is motivated from the string theory perspective .",
    "in particular , following @xcite we consider an effective action which comes from considering a type iib string compactification with neveu - schwarz ( ns - ns ) and ramond - ramond ( rr ) three - form fluxes with coordinates only on the extended space - time . effectively those fluxes are interpreted as three - form fluxes which can be real or complex , according to the specific flux configuration selected in the string theory action .",
    "+ once we have specified the effective action , we use group analysis as a method to find an analytical solution of non - linearized field einstein - kr equation systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the group analysis lets us know if a differential system admits solutions with specific symmetries such as , for example , spherical symmetry . by this method",
    ", we obtain a set of solutions which are invariant with respect to an admitted group of point transformations .",
    "some important works about symmetry analysis , can be seen in @xcite-@xcite , and some applications to einstein equations are found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , by means of this method , we find an analytical evolving and spherically symmetric solution of einstein equations with torsion .",
    "+ our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we focus on the action of a purely gravitational field theory in a background with torsion and we compute the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "they consist on two set of equations which must be reduced ; this is done in section iii , where we obtain explicitly the final system equations for the einstein - kr model .",
    "using group analysis ( analysis of symmetries ) , in section iv we find an evolving spherically symmetric solution . in section v , we take some appropriate limits on our solutions and we compare them with previous static solutions reported in literature . finally we show our conclusions and briefly comment on some possible physical implications .",
    "the presence of fluxes in string compactification yields the construction of a variety of four - dimensional effective actions depending on the way the fluxes are turned on .",
    "generically , for the fluxes living on the internal space is possible to stabilize the moduli related to the compactification process itself .",
    "+ for fluxes with coordinates on the extended four - dimensional space - time after compactification , effective actions can describe a curved space - time with torsion as shown in @xcite , where it was considered the presence of a neveu - schwarz - neveu - schwarz ( ns - ns ) three - form flux in a ten - dimensional type iib superstring with a bosonic action given by @xmath5 in the einstein - frame .",
    "] , and where @xmath6 is the complex scalar formed by the dilaton @xmath7 and the ramond - ramond ( rr ) zero - form @xmath8 .",
    "+ after compactification are used to denote ten - dimensional coordinates , while greek indices @xmath9 are used to describe four - dimensional extended coordinates . ] and by considering a space - time threaded with a three - form flux @xmath10 , this field induces a torsion component on the connection , yielding an effective @xmath11 dimensional and gauge - invariant action , with an einstein - cartan - kalb - ramond ( eckr ) coupling in presence of external matter fields ( we shall closely follow @xcite ) .",
    "the action is given by @xmath12where @xmath13 is the scalar curvature of the ec space - time and @xmath14 is the connection that contains the torsion tensor .",
    "notice that @xmath14 is the anti - symmetrization of the affine connection in ec space - time . as usual , @xmath15}$",
    "] is the strength of the kr field , @xmath3 and @xmath16 is the corresponding coupling constant .",
    "+ as shown in @xcite , the curvature scalar @xmath17 of the ec space - time can be written in terms of the curvature of a purely riemmannian space - time @xmath18 and the corresponding torsion tensor @xmath19 as@xmath20where @xmath19 satisfies the constraint equation@xmath21therefore , it is followed that the kr field strength @xmath22 plays the role of the spin angular momentum density , considered to be the source of torsion @xcite . + in our case , we start from the ten - dimensional action in the presence of both , ns - ns and rr three - form fluxes @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the corresponding action is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a complex three - form .",
    "notice that by turning off the rr field @xmath27 , the remnant is a real field .",
    "now , after compactification and by considering the complex three - form flux to have components on the extended four - dimensional space - time only , a torsion term in the effective four - dimensional theory is induced .",
    "this is analogous to the term in the action given by eq .",
    "( [ skra ] ) , with @xmath28 being substituted by @xmath29 .",
    "the effective action reads @xmath30 which we shall also refer to as eckr action .",
    "+ therefore , after making use of the constraint on the torsion element , the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath31where @xmath32 , a symmetric 2-tensor , plays the role of the energy - momentum tensor , which reads    @xmath33    following the notation used in @xcite , let us denote by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 the covariant four independent complex components , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , of the complex flux @xmath42 , and by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the corresponding complex - conjugated contravariant components .",
    "notice as well that from einstein equations , the curvature of the space - time is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 . therefore we expect that a solution of the einstein equations in the presence of torsion , describes a space - time with a negative curvature proportional to the flux , which in turn , is the source of torsion .",
    "+ recall that our goal is to find time - dependent exact solutions for the system of eqs .",
