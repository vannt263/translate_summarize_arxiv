    "the values of the fundamental constants such as the fine structure constant @xmath1 and the proton to electron mass ratio @xmath0 in the early universe provide important constraints and tests for cosmological theories such as quintessence and new physics models that suggest a coupling between the constants and rolling scalar fields .",
    "it was pointed out more than 35 years ago @xcite that changes in the value of the fundamental constant @xmath0 produce changes in molecular spectra such that observations of molecular spectra in high redshift objects can track the value of @xmath0 in the early universe .",
    "the recent advent of large telescopes with sensitive high resolution spectrometers and , most importantly , very accurate measurements of the wavelengths of the molecular hydrogen lyman and werner band transitions @xcite have made such observations possible .",
    "most of the relevant observations have been of the molecular hydrogen lyman and werner electronic absorption transitions in high redshift damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) @xcite .",
    "these observations have restricted the change in @xmath0 to @xmath5 at redshifts up to 3 .",
    "radio observations have established limits on @xmath6 on the order of @xmath7 using a comparison between the inversion transition of ammonia and the rotational transitions of other molecules at a redshift of 0.685 @xcite and at a redshift of 0.89 @xcite . at redshifts between 2 and 4 @xcite compared the frequencies of co rotational lines to the frequency of the fine structure transition of neutral carbon .",
    "this comparison , however , does not measure @xmath0 directly but rather @xmath8 .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to see what constraints or limits these observations can put on cosmological models and the necessity of new physics not consistent with the standard model .",
    "the situation regarding @xmath1 is less clear given the conflicting claims on the variation @xcite or constancy @xcite of @xmath1 with even claims of a spatial dipole variation of @xmath1 @xcite . given this state of uncertainty we will concentrate mainly on the limits imposed by the constancy of @xmath0 but will also consider the consequences of a variation in @xmath1 at the end of the analysis .",
    "as a definite example of a cosmological model with a potential @xmath9 defined by a rolling scalar field @xmath10 we will examine slow rolling freezing and thawing quintessence models following the discussion of @xcite and @xcite , hereinafter ds . in this case",
    "the dark energy is due to a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath10 governed by the equation of motion @xmath11 where h is the hubble parameter in units where @xmath12 .",
    "the slow roll conditions are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 which leads to a very flat potential .",
    "thawing solutions are where the equation of state parameter @xmath15 is initially near -1 and evolves away from -1 while freezing solutions start with @xmath16 not equal to -1 and evolve toward -1 at the present day .",
    "( ds ) have shown that these cosmologies follow trajectories given by @xmath17 ^ 2\\ ] ] where c is determined by an early condition on @xmath16 and @xmath18 @xmath19 and the dark energy density factor @xmath18 is given by @xmath20^{-1}\\ ] ] in ( [ eq - omega ] ) @xmath21 is the scale factor of the universe normalized to 1 at the present day and the subscript @xmath22 refers to the present epoch .",
    "thawing solutions are given by the special case where @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is necessarily small as given by equation [ eq - sr1 ] and is considered to be constant and equal to @xmath25 at all times .",
    "( ds ) consider several cases with values of c set to -1 , -0.5 , -0.1 , 0 .",
    ", 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , considered constant by ds , and @xmath28 adjusted to yield the listed values of c. we will use this suite of cases plus the added cases of c = -0.3 and c = 0.3 to determine what constraints are imposed by the observed values of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig - wc ] shows the evolution of w+1 as a function of the scale factor a for the various values of c. due to their large excursions from @xmath29 at high z the larger absolute values of c probably violate the slow roll condition .",
    "that is why we have added the c = + /-0.3 cases .",
    "all of the curves are for freezing quintessence except of the curve for c=0 which is for thawing quintessence . although hard to see at the scale of figure  [ fig - wc ] , the c=0 case for thawing quintessence has @xmath30 at @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath0 does not vary with time in the standard model any variation of @xmath0 must include new physics .",
    "this discussion follows the methodology described in @xcite , hereinafter nl which presumes a linear , non - varying , coupling of @xmath0 to the rolling scalar field",
    ". there can be many variations of the coupling between @xmath0 and the scalar field but this represents one of the simplest models .",
    "( nl ) actually consider the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath1 , however , most new physics models assume that @xmath1 and @xmath0 vary in the same manner and are connected in the following manner @xmath32 eg . @xcite . in ( [ eq - amu ] )",
    "@xmath33 is the qcd scale , @xmath34 is the higgs vacuum expectation value and r is often considered to be on the order of -40 to -50 @xcite but it is highly indeterminate .",
    "the variation in @xmath1 and consequentially @xmath0 is given as @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the coupling constant , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the planck mass .",
    "based on the work of @xcite ( nl ) place limits on @xmath40 of @xmath41 which translate to limits on @xmath42 of @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the equation of state is given in terms of the dark energy pressure @xmath45 , dark energy density @xmath46 and dark energy potential @xmath9 by @xmath47 ( nl ) then show that @xmath48 is also given by @xmath49 where @xmath18 is the dark matter energy density . here",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 indicate differentiation with respect to cosmic time and to @xmath52 respectively where @xmath21 is again the scale factor .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq - dmu ] ) that @xmath53 substitution of ( [ eq - phip ] ) into ( [ eq - wa ] ) then links @xmath16 and @xmath54 as @xmath55 which links the evolution of @xmath16 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "now that we have two different equations for @xmath48 , one involving only cosmological factors , the equation of state parameter , in the quintessence model discussed in section [ s - quin ] and one involving new physics in section [ s - np ] we can see what constraints the observations place on the parameters for these models . from  ( [ eq - wmu ] )",
    "we see that limits on @xmath56 place limits on the product @xmath57 if we assume that the cosmology of @xmath18 is known from equation  [ eq - omega ] .",
    "note that the use of equation  [ eq - omega ] restricts the results to the slow roll conditions . using the current limit on @xmath58",
    "we can define regions of parameter space in a @xmath59 - @xmath60 landscape that are forbidden or allowed by those limits .",
    "figure  [ fig - wze ] shows that space for the current limit on @xmath61 and for one where the limit is 50 times more stringent , a possibility using observations from expected new spectrometers such as pepsi on the lbt .",
    "it is obvious that as @xmath62 approaches 0 that the constraint of @xmath63 diminishes rapidly .",
    "this has to be so since it is the coupling with @xmath10 that both drives @xmath62 away from 0 and produces the change in @xmath0 .",
    "if the improved limits are achieved then there will be a more than 1000 times stronger constraint on @xmath63 even for very small values of @xmath62 .",
    "in the following we will use @xmath0 as a definite example but the result for @xmath1 is exactly the same with @xmath64 replacing @xmath65 . setting the right hand sides of equations  [ eq - wmu ] and  [ eq - qw ] equal to each other",
    "we get @xmath66 which yields @xmath67 we then use that @xmath68 to produce @xmath69 @xmath70 we next substitute in  ( [ eq - omega ] ) for @xmath18 to get @xmath71 \\nonumber \\\\ \\times [ \\tanh^{-1 } ( 1+(\\omega_{0}^{-1}-1)a^{-3})^{1/2}+c]\\}a^{-1}da\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we know that @xmath0 is constant to one part in @xmath72 to observable limits we can treat @xmath0 in the denominator of the left side of  ( [ eq - ddmu ] ) as a constant and finally get @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\ \\times [ \\tanh^{-1 } ( 1+(\\omega_{0}^{-1}-1)a^{-3})^{1/2}+c]\\}a^{-1}da\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  [ eq - deltamu ] can be numerically integrated using mathematica to show the evolution of the value of @xmath0 as a function of the scale factor a normalized to 1 at the present time and @xmath74 set to 0.7 .",
    "( ds ) use a constant @xmath24 of @xmath75 , satisfying the first slow roll condition and consider a range of the constant @xmath76 between -1 and 1 .",
    "negative values of c correspond to a field rolling down the potential and positive values indicate the field initially rolling up the potential .",
    "( ds ) indicate that the latter case is unlikely but they consider it for completeness .",
    "figure  [ fig - dmuz ] shows the results of the integration plotted as a function of redshift for a value of @xmath77 which is consistent with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .. it is evident from  ( [ eq - deltamu ] ) that the results scale linearly with @xmath65 .",
    "a comparison of the observed value of @xmath61 and the @xmath61 values predicted by the models with @xmath65 set to @xmath80 at a redshift of 3 is given in the first 7 entries of table  [ tab - preobs ] .",
    "it is evident from both the table and figure  [ fig - dmuz ] that most of the quintessence models considered in this paper , except for the thawing model , are ruled out by the observations if the coupling constant @xmath65 is as high as @xmath81 and the magnitude of @xmath76 is significantly greater than 0 .",
    "since the value of @xmath76 sets the initial value of @xmath62 in the freezing models the small value of @xmath61 favors models where @xmath62 is small or 0 in the early universe .",
    "it is certainly possible to bring any of the quintessence models into compliance by lowering the value of either @xmath65 or equivalently r in  ( [ eq - amu ] ) .",
    "however , these calculations show that using parameters that are common in the literature yields results that are incompatible with the present limits on @xmath61 .",
    "it therefore suggests that the limits on the variance of fundamental constants is a rigorous test that should be applied to any proposed cosmological models or new physics .",
    "the slow roll conditions and the linear coupling of the fundamental constants with the field are conditions that provide a minimal change in the constants , therefore , these results impose an even stronger constraint on quintessence type models with much steeper potentials .",
    "there have been persistent claims in the literature that the value of @xmath1 was different in the past than it is now .",
    "if we use the most recent claim of an altered previous value of @xmath1 of @xmath82 at redshifts around 3 @xcite we can check what conditions this imposes on @xmath61 . in figure  [ fig - da ]",
    "we have adjusted @xmath64 to give a value of @xmath83 for each value of c with r set to -40 .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig - da ] that none of the curves fit the high redshift @xmath61 measurements .",
    "table  [ tab - preobs ] indicates that at a redshift of three the predictions differ from the observations by about a factor of 130 .",
    "the thawing model ( @xmath23 ) is a particularly bad fit even at low redshifts since @xmath64 has to be set to a very high value to achieve the claimed value of @xmath84 . for this model",
    "the low redshift radio results of @xcite are more than a factor of 1000 less than the predicted value .",
    "these results significantly increase the tension between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 observations unless the magnitude of r in  ( [ eq - amu ] ) is about -0.3 at an epoch when the redshift is about 3 .",
    "this value of r is very different from the expected value of around -40 derived from generic gut models where the strong coupling constant and the higgs vacuum expectation value run exponentially faster than @xmath1 @xcite . in this context either the expectations from super symmetry considerations are flawed or the conclusions from the observations indicating a change in the value of @xmath1 in both space and time are in error .",
    ".model predictions versus observations at z=3 .",
    "the first 7 entries are for @xmath65 held at @xmath80 . in the last 7 entries the value of @xmath65",
    "is adjusted to produce a @xmath84 value of @xmath85 with r held at -40 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"
