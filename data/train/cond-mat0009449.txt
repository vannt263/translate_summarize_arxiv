    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce numerical methods that avoid unnecessary discretization  or , over - discretization  purely for the purpose of obtaining adequate accuracy .",
    "an important and classical example of this is large eddy simulation in the modeling of turbulent flows .",
    "many large scale flows of engineering , geophysical or atmospheric interest contain many length scales down to the dissipation scale , yet it is large scale drag that one wants to compute .",
    "in such a situation , it is wasteful and undesirable to expend computer time on details that are of no intrinsic interest .",
    "the approach outlined in this paper builds upon our previous work@xcite to use rg methods to integrate out the dynamics one wishes to ignore , so that numerical methods can instead focus on the appropriate scale of interest .",
    "this is not trivial because of scale interference : the nonlinear amplification of the effect of small scale dynamics , which contaminates and eventually pollutes the large scale dynamics .",
    "there are several distinct facets to this problem .",
    "first is the representation of the small scale dynamics as a stochastic field that acts on the coarse - grained degrees of freedom . as discussed in our earlier paper",
    ", this inevitably leads to non - locality .",
    "we will see here that it is possible not only to coarse - grain individual operators , as in ref . @xcite but also to coarse - grain at the level of the governing differential equation .",
    "this leads to a theory that is non - local in space and time .",
    "this applies to systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom , as well as spatially extended systems , which are the main focus of our work here .",
    "second , the representation of the theory on the lattice can be improved by systematically integrating out the small scales , leading to an effective theory that has no ( or few ) residual discretization artifacts .",
    "this is referred to as a perfect theory \" in the literature .",
    "we demonstrate how this arises and exhibit this feature by calculating the dispersion relation of the effective theory in the perfect representation .",
    "our work is related to that of chorin and co - workers @xcite who use optimal prediction methods to treat the lack of resolution of small scales .",
    "the main differences are that they assume that the small scales are initially in thermal equilibrium , and also that they do not attempt to remove lattice artifacts .",
    "there has also been an attempt to use similar methods in the study of isotropic turbulence@xcite .",
    "our work grew out of attempts to improve lattice gauge theory , pioneered by the paper of hasenfratz and niedermeyer .",
    "for a review of this body of work , the reader is referred to the review article by hasenfratz@xcite .",
    "in addition to the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , there have been two attempts@xcite to solve differential equations using perfect operators .",
    "as we will see below , it is not enough to perfectly coarse - grain the individual operators appearing in a partial differential equation : once there is a non - infinitesimal time step , coarse - graining introduces memory effects , so that the entire differential equation must be represented as coarse - grained in space - time .",
    "in addition , it should always be remembered that there is no unique perfect operator for a given differential operator .",
    "a specification must be made of the microscopic probability distribution for the small - scale degrees of freedom .",
    "these papers implicitly impose a gaussian free field theory distribution on the small - scale degrees of freedom .",
    "the methods given in the present article are more general , and make no such assumption , explicit or implicit .",
    "let us now introduce the problem of removing lattice artifacts .",
    "suppose the dynamics of a spatially extended system is described by a partial differential equation ( pde ) , which yields the solution @xmath0 .",
    "a standard procedure is to sample @xmath1 at points @xmath2 , which are equidistant with spacings @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and find a discretized form of the pde that is devised to approximate the values @xmath5 .",
    "the requirement is that in the continuum limit , the sequence @xmath6 converges to @xmath1 .",
    "the conventional way of discretizing the pde is to approximate differentiations with finite differences .",
    "the disadvantage of this _ uniform sampling _ ( us ) approach is that one is forced to reproduce as faithfully as possible all the detail and fine structure of the solution , even on a scale that may be of no interest or worse , beyond the regime of applicability of the differential equation itself .",
    "this has two consequences :    * a small grid size @xmath3 must be used , which implies many grid points must be calculated and stored ; * for dynamic problems , a small time step @xmath4 is implied by the small @xmath3 , either for reasons of accuracy or stability of the numerical method .    as a result",
    ", there is a huge computational cost associated with this conventional numerical scheme , which makes the study of problems such as critical dynamics and pattern formation very difficult to carry out .",
    "there is a need for improved , physically motivated methods for numerical experiments .",
    "the purpose of a numerical simulation is to study the macroscopic properties of a physical system .",
    "different microscopic dynamics may be related , via _ coarse graining _ ( cg ) , to the same macroscopic dynamics that defines a universality class .",
    "often cg means the local averaging of a continuous variable , @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the continuum variable , @xmath9 is its coarse - grained counterpart and @xmath10 is the coarse graining length scale . instead of focusing on the small scale degrees of freedom ,",
    "we should determine and use the coarse grained description of the system appropriate at the macroscopic scale .",
    "one of these physics - motivated numerical methods is the cell dynamical scheme@xcite , in which a discrete description of the system dynamics is obtained directly from considerations of the underlying symmetry and conservation laws .",
    "it has been successfully used to tackle problems such as asymptotic scaling behavior in spinodal decomposition@xcite and the approach to equilibrium in systems with continuous symmetries , such as xy magnets@xcite and liquid crystals@xcite .",
    "there have also been attempts at using the rg in dynamic monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "to investigate what is required to obtain a coarse - grained dynamic description , suppose that we denote the coarse - graining operator at scale @xmath10 by the symbol @xmath11 , which transforms @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "then conceptually we need to find the operator @xmath14 which connects @xmath15 and @xmath13 given the microscopic time evolution operator @xmath16 connecting @xmath17 with @xmath12 , as shown schematically in the commutativity diagram below : @xmath18    notice that there is not a unique choice of @xmath11 . the usual choice is local averaging . in principle , other operators can be used , such as the majority rule scheme used in the coarse graining of ising spins in thermal equilibrium .",
    "once a coarse - graining operator @xmath11 has been defined , there should be a unique prescription to obtain @xmath14@xcite . in this paper , coarse graining",
    "is understood to mean local averaging .",
    "later , stochastic coarse graining will be introduced as a variant of the simple local averaging . in the development of the theory of perfect operators a parameter , denoted here by @xmath19 ( see section iiib ) , naturally arises , which characterizes the nature of the coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the form ( [ eqn : coarsegrainvar ] ) is only appropriate if @xmath19 is infinite ; if @xmath20 , additional noise terms are generated which reflect the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "as already stressed in our earlier paper@xcite , it is inconsistent to work with a perfect operator with @xmath20 and to use the @xmath21 form ( [ eqn : coarsegrainvar ] ) as some authors@xcite have done .",
    "we also see no reason why coarse - grained equations should be derived by varying a coarse - grained action in the absense of a small parameter , which is the starting point of these authors .",
    "instead we begin with a dynamics which is intrinsically stochastic and study the effect of cg on this system .",
    "the well - known path - integral formulation of such equations may then be used to carry out the cg : there is no need to invoke a variational principle .",
    "we need to consider the appropriate coarse - graining scale .",
    "two situations are possible here . in the first",
    ", we suppose that the solution we wish to obtain has a natural scale @xmath10 below which there is no significant structure . in that case ,",
    "our goal is to avoid having to over - discretize the problem merely in order to attain the accuracy of the continuum limit .",
    "thus , we would like to be able to use as large a value for the grid spacing @xmath3 as possible without sacrificing accuracy . in the second situation",
    ", there is no such obvious scale , or at least , it is not known _ a priori _ , but the computational demands are so large that it is simply not feasible to work with a grid spacing @xmath3 smaller than some size @xmath10 . in this case , we would like to minimize in some sense the artifacts that must inevitably arise .",
    "the first situation is more straightforward because the only issue is speed of convergence to the continuum limit : there is no explicit discarding of important dynamical information . in the second situation ,",
    "one is making an uncontrolled and potentially severe truncation of the correct dynamics .",
    "one has to ask : can one model the neglected unresolved scales as effective renormalizations of the coefficients in the original pde ?",
    "are the neglected degrees of freedom usefully thought of as noise for the retained large - scale degrees of freedom ? and how can any available statistical information on the small - scale degrees of freedom be used to improve the numerical solution for the large - scale degrees of freedom ?",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we set up the coarse - graining algebra , which forms the basis of our approach , using the path - integral formulation of stochastic dynamics as our starting point .",
    "this formalism is then used in section iii to obtain the perfect operator for dynamics governed by linear operators .",
    "section iv describes the results of numerical simulations using the perfect operator with langevin dynamics and section v using the monte carlo approach .",
    "a range of issues is discussed , from applications of the method to the diffusion equation and nonlinear model a dynamics to the question of the truncation of perfect operators required when carrying out simulations .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section vi and the structure of the coarse - graining algebra is discussed in an appendix .",
    "in this section , we derive the path integral formulation of the langevin dynamics and present the general framework under which the perfect linear operator is derived .",
    "the analysis is applicable to both pdes and stochastic differential equations . for simplicity ,",
    "we study a system whose dynamics is described by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) with the following form , @xmath22    where @xmath23 is a field , @xmath24 is the forcing term ( it can depend on @xmath23 and/or its spatial derivatives ) , and @xmath25 is a white noise .    it is convenient to regularize the problem on a ( fine ) @xmath26 lattice with grid size @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the space and time directions , respectively . in the lattice picture ,",
    "all variables in the original pde are vectors of functions of discrete space @xmath27 and time @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "we define @xmath31 and denote the space - time volume element @xmath32 by @xmath33 . the noise satisfies @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the noise strength and @xmath37 is the kronecker symbol . given the system is in the state @xmath38 at time @xmath39 , the probability that the system will be in state @xmath40 at time @xmath41 is given by@xcite , @xmath42 \\ } \\ , \\delta(\\eta - \\partial_t{\\phi } -   f(\\phi))\\ , , \\label{eqn : c3_1pi}\\ ] ]    where the integration is over all configurations beginning at @xmath38 and ending at @xmath40 .",
    "we can use this path - integral formula to determine the dynamics followed by the coarse grained or uniform sampled variable .    by a _ discretization scheme _ , we will mean a process made up of a series of _ magnifying operations _ which lead from a microscopic description of a system to a macroscopic description on a lattice .",
    "these magnification operations are , by default , magnification of a length scale by a factor of 2 . coarse graining and uniform sampling are both special cases of a discretization scheme .",
    "suppose a system is specified by the values of a function @xmath24 , such as a field configuration , on a fine lattice with 2n grid points @xmath43 separated by grid size @xmath3 .",
    "one step ( level ) of coarse graining is defined as local averaging of the function s values at every two neighboring sites .",
    "vector @xmath45 is the coarse grained version of @xmath24 , while @xmath46 stores the detailed information that is lost after coarse graining .",
    "after one level of cg , the system is described by a new function @xmath45 on a coarser lattice with @xmath47 grid points separated by twice the original grid size of @xmath48 , where the superscript @xmath49 indicates `` magnified value '' .",
    "we define @xmath50 projection matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 such that    @xmath53    these matrices act as projection and inverse projection operators between the original functional space and the coarse grained functional space .",
    "they facilitate an easier mathematical formulation .",
    "many of the properties of the matrices can be found in the appendix .",
    "if we are interested in an operator @xmath54 on the original grid , then it is possible to define four corresponding operators on the coarse - grained grid , which we denote by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , @xmath57    the analogous definitions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given in the appendix .",
    "a similar algebraic scheme can be defined for the uniform sampling transformation , where the projection operator samples every other point and discards the rest : @xmath60 @xmath61,\\ \\ n\\in[1 , n].\\ ] ]    using the notations listed above , we can write down the magnification procedure in space for the @xmath62 dimensional version of ( [ eqn : c3_1pde ] ) , coarse graining in space only .",
    "the integrations over the @xmath23 and @xmath25 variables are decomposed into integrations over @xmath63 and @xmath64 variables and the @xmath64 integration carried out using the delta - function .",
    "the remaining delta - function is replaced using the identity @xmath65 .",
    "this leads to a path integral , neglecting any constant factors , of the form @xmath66\\ } \\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int d\\tilde{\\phi } \\ , \\exp\\{-\\frac{\\delta v^{m}}{2 \\omega}\\sum^{n , n'}[\\frac{1}{c}\\ , ( \\partial_t{\\tilde{\\phi } } + { \\tilde{f}})^2 + i { q } \\ , { \\bar{f } } - \\frac{\\omega}{\\delta x^{m } } ( \\partial_{\\bar{\\phi } } \\bar{f } + \\partial_{\\tilde{\\phi } } \\tilde{f } )   ] \\}\\ , , \\label{eqn : c3_2cgpi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the constant @xmath67 is 1 or 2 for cg and us respectively due to their different projection matrix properties and where @xmath68 is the magnified volume element .",
    "the important point is that , in general , both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are functions of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "what we would like to do , is integrate over the @xmath73 degrees of freedom , carry out the @xmath74 integration and end up with a form similar to the one we started with , but with new , renormalized , parameters . more specifically",
    ", we would like the integration over @xmath73 to give a result of the form @xmath75 .",
    "then we could readily integrate over @xmath74 and compare the result with the path - integral form to read off the evolution equation for the new coarse grained variable as @xmath76 .",
    "however , we would not expect to be able to do this in general , and as usual in all applications of the rg , an approximation scheme has to be developed alongside this formalism in order to make any progress .",
    "there is , however , one case in which the integrations can be carried out , and that is the linear case .",
    "we therefore study this first , before returning to the nonlinear case later .",
    "in this section , we will determine perfect operators of dynamics governed by linear operators .",
    "we will find the fixed point flow of operators for the diffusion equation under cg and us transformations .",
    "in addition , the perfect operator in discrete space and time is obtained for the diffusion equation and its properties discussed .",
    "we begin by performing the magnifying transformation on the sde ( [ eqn : c3_1pde ] ) where @xmath24 is a linear function of @xmath23 , that is , @xmath77    where @xmath25 is a white noise . here",
    "@xmath78 is a general linear operator and contains spatial , but not temporal , derivatives .",
    "it is assumed to possess inversion symmetry and translational invariance .",
    "for the diffusion equation , @xmath78 is the finite difference laplacian operator with a minus sign .",
    "the conventional choice is the central difference operator @xmath79 .    to obtain the dynamics of the coarse grained variable",
    ", we have to integrate out the small length scale degrees of freedom in equation ( [ eqn : c3_1pi ] ) . in the linear case ,",
    "the jacobian term is constant and so does not enter into the analysis . applying the projection matrices to equation ( [ eqn : c4_1force ] ) , inserting the result into the path integral in equation ( [ eqn : c3_2cgpi ] ) and integrating out the @xmath80 and @xmath74 degrees of freedom yields @xmath81\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . here",
    "the operator @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 . defining a new noise source @xmath86^{-1}\\eta^{m}$ ] and carrying out the integration over @xmath87 yields @xmath88    comparing with the form ( [ eqn : c3_1pi ] )",
    ", it follows that the dynamic equation satisfied by @xmath89 is    @xmath90    where @xmath91 .",
    "the new noise source @xmath92 is no longer a white noise : it has a spatial correlation as well as a time correlation : @xmath93    given that the noise source is no longer markovian after the first step of coarse graining , we need to start with a more general noise source in order to iterate the coarse graining procedure .",
    "define a general gaussian noise source with the following properties , @xmath94    repeating the above analysis , we find that the coarse grained dynamic equation remains the same , however the coarse grained correlation matrix is modified and is given by @xmath95    where @xmath96 .",
    "the presence of time derivatives in @xmath97 makes the noise non - markovian . in general",
    ", we should be careful about the boundary term in this case@xcite .",
    "in particular , we need to specify corresponding initial conditions for each time derivative generated through the iterative relation .",
    "the first term in @xmath98 is _ not _ what we would naively choose as the laplacian operator with a coarse grained grid size @xmath99 .",
    "instead , the second term , which comes from accounting for the influence of the integrated out small length scale degrees of freedom , gives an important contribution to the coarse grained operator and can not be treated as a perturbation .",
    "it is more convenient to examine the coarse graining in fourier space ( see the appendix ) , where all matrices are now scalars dependent on wavenumbers denoted by @xmath100 or @xmath101 , and frequencies denoted by @xmath102 .",
    "we may formally rewrite the iterative relation for @xmath103 in fourier space as , @xmath104    each successive coarse graining procedure gives us a new operator which weighs information from two different points of fourier space , corresponding to wave modes of different length scales , and puts them into a new point . even though the original linear operator contains only differentiation in space ,",
    "the new linear operator after one step of cg has a time differentiation component as well . for @xmath105",
    ", we can prove analytically ( and verify numerically ) that the operator reaches a fixed point , @xmath106    this is the perfect operator for @xmath107 in one dimension .",
    "one might hope that this operator can be recombined with @xmath108 and used in the dynamic equation to give a perfect dynamics .",
    "it turns out that this is in general _ in_correct .",
    "the reason is that the iterative relation from the path - integral calculation is a dynamic iterative relation with time derivative in it .",
    "when one sets @xmath109 , physically it translates into the assumption that small scale degrees of freedom are enslaved by the large scale dynamics .",
    "the small scale degrees of freedom instantaneously adjust to the large scale ones which are kept after each magnifying transformation .",
    "this is not physical .",
    "since we are only magnifying in space , the time differentiation is diagonal in this phase space .",
    "we have the trivial relations , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we define the full space - time _ evolution operator _ ,",
    "@xmath112 and the _ action operator _ , @xmath113 and express the iterative relation in terms of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this leads to a simple form for the full iterative relation ( see appendix ) , @xmath116    where the constant factor @xmath67 is 1 for cg and 2 for us .",
    "the second iterative relation physically means that the coarse grained version of the two point function of the true dynamics is preserved , if the coarse grained variable is governed by the operator @xmath114 with a non - markovian noise source @xmath97 .",
    "the above iterative relations are readily generalized when magnifications are carried out along the time direction .",
    "we now wish to determine the fixed point solutions of the operators @xmath117 and @xmath115 under their iterative relations .",
    "it can be shown that the operators approach their fixed points exponentially fast as a function of the number of iterative steps , irrespective of their detailed form at the microscopic scale .",
    "the fixed point solutions are given below while the exponential approach is illustrated in figure [ fig : c4_2usfunc ] .",
    "we begin the the simpler case of us . starting from a zeroth order operator of the form",
    "@xmath118 , appropriate for a description at the microscopic scale @xmath119 , after repeated us transformations we arrive at the operator suitable for the length scale @xmath120 .",

    "so far , we have only coarse grained the spatial degree of freedom and obtained the corresponding perfect operators . in order to move on to numerical calculations on a lattice",

    "we derive the fixed point solution of @xmath115 .",
    "we give a nearly closed form solution for @xmath151 and show that this operator gives a perfect dispersion relation as measured from the time displaced two point function .",
    "the stochastic coarse graining scheme is introduced , which modifies @xmath115 to give us an operator with reduced range of interaction .",
    "the iterative relation we developed previously does not hinge on whether cg was carried out on the space or time axis .",
    "therefore , we can use it to cg in the time direction as well .",
    "either one can start from a continuous description and alternately cg in space and in time , or one can directly use the perfect operator we developed previously and only cg from continuous time .",
    "now , there is another dimensionless parameter , namely the ratio of the time scale over the characteristic time appropriate for a chosen length scale .",
    "for the diffusion equation , it is @xmath152 .",
    "we already see the manifestation of this parameter in the perfect operator derived earlier , where only the combination of the form @xmath153 enters the expressions . therefore , there are two restrictions on how we apply the two schemes . in the first case , we should cg twice in time direction for each cg operation in the spatial direction , maintaining the value of the ratio @xmath152 throughout the process .",
    "this means , for any reasonable values of @xmath152 at the macroscopic side , we need to start with a small @xmath3 and a very small @xmath4 . in the second case",

    "to do so , it is convenient to introduce @xmath172 and the function @xmath173    then , after some simple algebraic manipulation , one finds @xmath174    now what remains of the summation is much easier to evaluate due to its exponential decaying behavior .    from the above equation , we can obtain the dispersion relation implied by such an operator .",
    "the two point function for a free field is @xmath175 .",

    "for example , for @xmath180 , @xmath181 , the amplitude of the next most significant mode ( @xmath182 ) is only @xmath183 of that of the @xmath184 mode .",

    "the best scheme is to choose @xmath192 such that the most significant couplings lie within a rectangle area elongated along the @xmath193 direction .",
    "this way , the total number of significant couplings is minimized .",

    ", we can obtain an operator with a near perfect dispersion relation . if two parameters ( @xmath198 and @xmath199 ) are used to obtain a @xmath200 operator , the average error for the dispersion relation is about @xmath201 . by fitting four parameters ( by also including @xmath202 and @xmath203 ) ,",
    "we can obtain a @xmath204 operator  called the modified perfect operator ( mpo )  which yields a dispersion relation with an average error of @xmath205 with respect to the exact result as shown in figure [ fig : c6_3genidispersion ] .",
    "the operator coefficients for @xmath206 are given in table [ tbl : c6_3rho ] .",
    "for the mpo , the scaling regime starts from the first time node of the two point function ( i.e. @xmath207 ) due to the nearest neighbor interaction along the time direction .",
    "so long as the first two time nodes have reliable values , one can estimate the decay rate .",
    "this greatly loosens the precision constraint placed by the perfect operator used before .",
    "when the field has mass , direct fitting under modified constraints that take into account the mass cause little change in the coefficients .",
    "we tested the mpo in simulations of model a dynamics .",
    "the results are comparable to that of the perfect operator ( see figure [ fig : c6_3abovexgeni ] ) .",
    "it actually gives more accurate decay rates for wave modes at the edge of the first brillouin zone , since it allows the use of the @xmath208 and @xmath209 nodes to compute the decay rate , while doing this for the po is an approximation .",
    "the computational effort for the mpo is drastically reduced due to the relatively short interaction range .",
    "the perfect linear operator operates on the coarse grained variable . for the modified perfect operator ,",
    "the physical meaning of the variable it operates on is not apparent .",
    "as discussed in section i , there is a correspondence between an operator and a specific coarse graining scheme . for the local averaging cg scheme , or hard cg",
    ", the resulting perfect operator has a long interaction range .",
    "however , the range of interaction is reduced after we modify the cg scheme to be a soft cg scheme dependent on the parameter @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to think that there is a variant of the standard local averaging coarse graining scheme that gives the fast decaying operator we have computed above .",
    "the further investigation of this point is of general interest as regards the development of an efficient numerical algorithm .",
    "the work presented in this paper is a first step towards reaping the full benefit of using renormalization group in the study of dynamics of spatially extended systems .",
    "we have constructed perfect representations of stochastic pdes that not only integrate out the small scale degrees of freedom ( in space and time ) , but also develop non - local representations of the underlying equations that are free of lattice artifacts .",
    "we demonstrated this by computing the dispersion relation for elementary excitations , and comparing the results at large wavenumbers with theoretical expressions valid in the continuum limit .",
    "we exhibited computations for diffusion equations , and a nonlinear equation derived from model a dynamics , and explored different ways to truncate the non - local space - time operators generated by the rg .    in one dimension ,",
    "the computational complexity was reduced by a factor of about 40 from conventional simulations , for the simple diffusion problem . for the nonlinear model a equation , the results were less impressive , in terms of computer time , because a systematic approximation scheme for the perfect action has yet to be developed .",
    "nevertheless , proceeding heuristically , we were still able to obtain improved results for the static structure factor and the decay rate of modes .",
    "lastly , we proposed a heuristic discretization algorithm that incorporates the ideas of perfect operators , but also gives operators that are more local than perfect operators .",
    "finding the perfect operator when nonlinear interactions are present is a non - trivial task . the form of the continuous action is not closed under the cg transformation and new complicated interaction terms are generated .",
    "this is a general property of the rg@xcite .",
    "usually progress is only possible if the problem under consideration involves a small parameter which can be used to keep track of the new interactions which are generated .",
    "more generally , the small parameter allows a systematic approximation scheme to be developed , in which there is a clear prescription as to which terms have to be included at a given order .",
    "if such a parameter is not available , it is usual to fall back on to some type of variational scheme , typically including some kind of self - consistent calculation which corresponds to summing sets of diagrams .",
    "neither of these approaches have been attempted in this paper .",
    "however , we feel that the results which we have obtained are sufficiently encouraging that some type of systematic calculation of the perfect operator in nonlinear theories would turn the ideas presented in this paper into a powerful computational tool .          1 .",
