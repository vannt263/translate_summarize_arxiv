    "investigation of the decay properties of nuclear resonant states is an important part of the nuclear structure studies . usually in such investigations only two - body decay channels",
    "are allowed for .",
    "three - body decays are much more informative than the two - body ones , but the full description of a three - body decay is a very complicated problem .",
    "thus it is very important to derive simple but accurate approximate approaches for the analysis of the experimental data and for making reliable theoretical predictions .",
    "one of the approaches of such kind is the approach based on the democratic decay approximation .",
    "a three - body continuum spectrum wave function in the asymptotic region is generally a superposition of the components describing two- and three - body decay channels  @xmath9 .",
    "the democratic decay approximation accounts for the three - body channel only ; two - body channels associated with the appearance of bound two - body subsystems and non - democratic subdivision of the system of the type ( 2 + 1 ) , are not allowed for in the approximation . therefore , this approximation is valid only for the study of a three - body system in the case when all two - body decay channels are closed and the only open channel is a three - body channel . generally speaking , if the three - body channel is the only open one , than the system can have two types of asymptotics  @xmath9 .",
    "one of the asymptotics corresponds to the situation when one of the particles is scattered by another one and the third particle is a spectator . from the general physical point of view , this asymptotics is supposed to be of little importance for a nuclear system excited in some nuclear reaction and decaying via a three - body channel . the alternative type of the asymptotics is a superposition of ingoing and outgoing six - dimensional spherical waves ( or , equivalently , six - dimensional plane wave and ingoing or outgoing six - dimensional spherical wave ) and corresponds to the situation when the decaying system emits ( or / and absorbs ) three particles from one and the same point in space .",
    "the version of the scattering theory that allows only for three - body asymptotics of this type is called true three - body scattering theory , or , alternatively , @xmath10 scattering theory ; the approximation based on the allowance for @xmath11 scattering only in the examination of nuclear reactions is called democratic decay approximation .    nuclear structure studies within the framework of democratic decay approximation have been started in 70th by prof .",

    "the reviews of the results obtained by the tbilisi group can be found in refs .",
    "recently a considerable progress has been made in both theoretical and experimental studies of democratic decays .",
    "below we shall briefly review some of the recent results .",
    "in particular , we shall discuss the results of experimental studies of democratic decays of @xmath1 nuclei via the three - body channel @xmath13 , theoretical investigations of monopole excitations of @xmath3c nucleus in the cluster model @xmath14 and @xmath5li structure studies in the cluster model @xmath15li@xmath16 .",
    "detailed experimental study of the three - body decay of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 states in @xmath20he , @xmath20li and @xmath20be nuclei has been performed by the group from kurchatov institute ( see  @xmath21 and references therein ) .",
    "the democratic decay concept has been for the first time experimentally tested in this investigation , and the democratic nature of the decay of these states via the only open channel @xmath22 has been unambiguously demonstrated .",
    "the wave function in the democratic decay approximation has the following asymptotics : @xmath23\\chi_{sm_s}\\ ,                           \\label{1}\\ ] ] where the first term is a six - dimensional plane wave while the second one is an ingoing six - dimensional spherical wave ; @xmath24 is the @xmath10 scattering amplitude ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are jacobi coordinates , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are associated canonically conjugated momenta ; hyper - radius @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ; @xmath31 is the energy measured from the three - body breakup threshold ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the total spin of the system and its projection while @xmath34 is the spin part of the wave function .",
    "it is natural to expand the decay amplitude @xmath24 in hyperspherical harmonics @xmath35 and to couple the three - body orbital momentum @xmath36 and the spin @xmath32 into the total angular momentum @xmath2 . as a result , for the decay amplitude @xmath37 of a resonant state with the total spin @xmath2 and its projection @xmath38 we have the following expression  @xmath39 : @xmath40_{jm}\\ .",

    "it is convenient to use the yamanouchi symbol @xmath46 and the young scheme [ @xmath47 for @xmath44 if there are three identical particles in the final state ; otherwise orbital momenta @xmath48 and @xmath49 corresponding to jacobi coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 are usually used for @xmath44 .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is a generalization of the usual angular momentum decomposition of a two - body scattering amplitude and can be formally applied to any three - body decay .",
    "note , that hypermomentum @xmath41 is not an integral of motion , and due to the two - body interactions components labelled by different values of @xmath41 mix together in the wave function , so , partial amplitudes @xmath50 with various values of @xmath41 are present in the expansion ( [ 2 ] ) . for a two - body decay channel",
    "the expansion ( [ 2 ] ) is non - convergent ; in the case when two - body subsystems of the decaying three - body system have sharp resonances , the convergence can appear to be very slow .",
    "if two - body subsystems of the three - body system have neither bound nor sharp resonant states , than the @xmath43 scattering amplitude @xmath37 converges rapidly and only few terms play an important role in eq .",

    "thus only in the case of democratic decay of such system it is possible to extract partial amplitudes @xmath50 from the experimental data , i.e. , to solve the problem that is somewhat similar to the problem of the spin assignment to a resonant state by the analysis of two - body scattering data .",
    "the hyperspherical harmonics @xmath51 are functions of five angles in the formal six - dimensional momentum space \\{@xmath52}. one of the angles , @xmath53 , rules the energy distribution between two jacobi coordinates . therefore , in order to evaluate partial amplitudes @xmath54 , one should analyze energy spectra of emitted particles . the analysis of ref .",

    "the dash - dotted curve displays the sum of the contributions to ewsr from all states with excitation energies less than @xmath31 , i.e. , the function @xmath129 where @xmath130 the monopole sum rule @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is the rms radius of the @xmath3c nucleus .",

    "it is seen that the most essential contributions to ewsr are connected with the quasistationary levels with excitation energies 6.11 , 10.39 , 13.60 and 22.30  mev ( 31% , 29% , 13% and 13% , respectively ) .",

    "the first excited @xmath62 state with the excitation energy @xmath135  mev belongs to the discrete spectrum , so , the continuum does not affect its properties .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath136 is 7.66  mev and this state belongs to the @xmath119 continuum .",
    "however , its width is very small ( @xmath137  ev ) and its properties are rather close to those of the discrete spectrum states .",
    "the allowance for the continuum slightly changes the properties of the 10.39  mev @xmath62 state .",
    "namely , the @xmath138 maximum shifts down to @xmath139 mev , the state gets some width and its contribution to ewsr decreases to 26%",
    ".    however , in the 1325 mev excitation region the effect of the continuum appears to be essential .",
    "the levels in this excitation energy region get considerable widths and merge each other , forming very broad ( of @xmath140  mev in width ) plateau of a peculiar shape , i.e. , the strength function @xmath138 is almost constant between 13 and 25  mev except for a bump of the width of 23  mev at an excitation energy of about 20  mev .",
    "the bump should be related to the 20  mev monopole resonance observed in refs .",
    "33% of the ewsr is exhausted in the 1226  mev excitation energy region , with 16% of the ewsr being exhausted in the 1822  mev interval .",

    "3 , reproduces quite correctly the positions of the strong @xmath73 absorption regions .",
    "the broad and smooth pedestal of the 20  mev @xmath73 excitation strength maximum can be easily misinterpreted in experimental studies as a background .",
    "the shape of the background that has been subtracted by eyrich et al  @xmath72 in their study of the 20  mev resonance , is similar to the shape of the pedestal on fig .",
    "if the experimental background is a real manifestation of the smooth pedestal of the @xmath73 strength , than it should be higher for small scattering angles . from fig .  3 of ref .",

    "so , the experimental spectra of ref .",
    "@xmath72 is in qualitative agreement with theoretical results of ref.@xmath15 .",
    "the further investigation of the nature of the background is needed .",
    "the results presented on fig .  3",
    "give the explanation why the giant monopole resonance is nearly not seen in @xmath3c .",
    "there are two physical reasons .",
    "first one is the strong fragmentation of the @xmath73 strength in @xmath3c . as a result ,",
    "more than 50% of the ewsr is exhausted by the 7.65  mev and 10  mev resonances , and not too much of the @xmath73 strength is left for the giant monopole resonance .",
    "the second reason is the continuum spectrum effect . due to the democratic decay",
    ", the giant monopole resonance gets a large width and merge with other @xmath62states . as a result",
    ", the @xmath73 strength becomes very smooth , and the giant monopole resonance manifests itself only as a non - prominent bump on the smooth pedestal . about 15% of the ewsr is exhausted in the vicinity of 20  mev bump , but if the pedestal is treated as a background , than the contribution of the resonance to the ewsr is severely underestimated .",
    "light neutron - rich nuclei like @xmath20he , @xmath142he , @xmath5li , @xmath143be , etc . , are extensively studied now ( see recent review papers  @xmath144 and references therein ) .",
    "these nuclei are often called exotic nuclei ; they are also often called barromean nuclei , because they have a well - pronounced cluster structure @xmath145 and after removing a neutron from any of these nuclei , the remaining system @xmath146 becomes unbound .",
    "two excess loosely - bound neutrons have a wide spatial distribution with long tail reaching far out and form the so - called neutron halo .",
    "the neutron halo manifests itself in a number of unusual properties of exotic nuclei , in particular , in a large value of the rms radius of the nucleus , in the existence of the soft dipole mode , etc .",
    "it is natural to make use of the democratic decay approximation in the study of barromean nuclei . in ref .",

    "the @xmath5li ground state energy obtained in the @xmath2-matrix calculations without the use of the smoothing , @xmath165 , shows a staggering as @xmath160 increases - matrix calculation is not a variational one , so , the ground state energy may behave non - monotonically as @xmath160 increases . ]",

    "@xmath185 with the allowance for two - body decay channels only , failed to reproduce the form of the @xmath175 peak and underestimate the energy of the soft dipole mode ..",
    "the soft dipole mode exhausts about 90% of the cluster ewsr , @xmath186 , associated with the excitation of the cluster degrees of freedom only .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to show that @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the total ewsr accounting for excitations of all nucleons .",
    "so , the contribution from the soft dipole mode to the total ewsr is relatively small . in the vicinity of the @xmath175 maximum at the excitation energy @xmath189 mev only @xmath1908% of the total ewsr is exhausted . nevertheless , the account for the soft dipole mode results in an essential increase of the electromagnetic dissociation cross section of 0.8 gev / nucleon @xmath5li beams on pb and cu targets .",
    "the wide space distribution of the halo neutrons density is also well - manifested in the electromagnetic dissociation of @xmath5li beam .",

    "these quantities are the sums of the @xmath5li and target nucleus charge radii . with these values of @xmath192",
    "we obtain for the electromagnetic dissociation cross sections the values of 0.966 barn for the pb target and 0.132 barn for the cu target ; the corresponding experimental values are @xmath193 barn and 0.21@xmath1940.04 barn , respectively@xmath195 . @xmath73 and @xmath179 transitions give only 1.2% contribution in the cross sections .",
