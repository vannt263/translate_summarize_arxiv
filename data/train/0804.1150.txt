    "there are four ways by which extrasolar planets have been detected .",
    "the first method to unambiguously detect an extrasolar planet was pulsar timing , which relies on detecting periodic variations in the timing of the received radio signal that occur as the pulsar orbits about the system s barycenter .",
    "the first system of three planets was found around psr b1257 + 12 in 1992 @xcite , followed by a single planet around psr b1620 - 26 @xcite .",
    "although rare , the pulsar planets are some of the lowest mass extrasolar planets known : psr b1257 + 12a is about twice the mass of the moon .",
    "the second way to find extrasolar planets is through radial velocities ( rv ) , which uses the doppler shift of observed stellar spectra to look for periodic variations in the target star s radial velocity . by estimating the mass of primary star , the observed radial velocity curve and velocity semi - amplitude",
    "can then be used to directly calculate the inclination - dependent mass ( @xmath0 ) of the companion object . to date",
    ", rv surveys have detected more than 230 planets around other stars , making it the most successful method of extrasolar planet detection . while the large number of detected systems having an unseen companion with a mass on the order of @xmath1 statistically ensures that the majority of these are planetary bodies , the rv surveys are unable to provide more information than the minimum masses , periods , eccentricities , and the semi - major axes of the planets .",
    "rv surveys also have a limited ability to detect planets much smaller than a few earth masses .",
    "the state of the art in rv surveys is the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher ( harps ) spectrometer at the la silla observatory in chile , which is capable of radial velocity measurements with precisions better than @xmath2 for extended periods of time @xcite .",
    "harps is therefore able to detect planets with masses on the order of @xmath3 to @xmath4 in relatively short period orbits .",
    "unfortunately , planets closer to an earth mass will be increasingly difficult to detect since intrinsic stellar variability , in the form of acoustic oscillation modes and granulations on the photosphere , makes more precise spectroscopic radial velocity measurements harder to acquire .",
    "however , it may be possible to surmount this obstacle ( as in the case of @xcite ) through the selection of stars with `` quiet '' photospheres and long integration times which serve to average out the stellar variability .",
    "gravitational microlensing is another technique for detecting extrasolar planets .",
    "microlensing of a star occurs when a a star passes near the line of sight of the observer to another background star .",
    "the gravity of the foreground star acts as a lens on the light emitted by the background star , which causes the star in the background to become momentarily brighter as more light is directed towards the observer .",
    "planetary companions to the lens star can further magnify the background star , and create short - term perturbations to the microlensing light curve . to date , six planets have been detected using microlensing @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the one - shot nature of microlensing observations means that information about systems discovered this way is generally sparser than that available for rv systems .",
    "therefore , microlensing is most useful in determining the general statistical properties of extrasolar planets , such as their frequency and distribution , and not the detailed properties of the planetary systems .",
    "planetary transits are a fourth method by which extrasolar planets have been discovered , and the one that provides the most complete set of information about the planetary system",
    ". only planets with very specific orbital characteristics have a transit visible from earth , because the orbital plane has to be aligned to within a few degrees of the line of sight . therefore transiting planets are rare .",
    "nevertheless , a transiting extrasolar planet offers the opportunity to determine the mass of the planet ( when combined with rv measurements ) since the inclination is now measurable , as well as the planetary radius , the density , the composition of the planetary atmosphere , the thermal emission from the planet , and many other properties ( see @xcite for a review ) . additionally , and unlike rv surveys ,",
    "transiting planets should be readily detectable down to @xmath5 and beyond , even for relatively long periods .",
    "having accurate predictions of the number of detectable transiting planets is immediately important for the evaluation and design of current and future transit surveys . for the current surveys ,",
    "predictions allow the operators to judge how efficient are their data - reduction and transit detection algorithms .",
    "future surveys can use the general prediction method that we describe here to optimize their observing set - ups and strategies .",
    "more generally , such predictions allow us to test different statistical models of extrasolar planet distributions .",
    "specifically , as more transiting planets are discovered and characterized , predictions relying on incorrect statistics of extrasolar planet properties will increasingly diverge from the observed set of distributions .",
    "using straightforward estimates it appears that observing a planetary transit should not be too difficult , presuming that one observes a sufficient number of stars with the requisite precision during a given photometric survey .",
    "specifically , if we assume that the probability of a short - period giant planet ( as an example ) transiting the disk of its parent star is 10% , and take the results of rv surveys which indicate the frequency of such planets is about 1% @xcite , together with the assumption that typical transit depths are also about 1% , the number of detections should be @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of surveyed stars with a photometric precision better than 1% .",
    "unfortunately , this simple and appealing calculation fails . using this estimate",
    ", we would expect that the tres survey , which has examined approximately 35,000 stars with better than 1% precision , to have discovered 35 transiting short period planets .",
    "but , at the date of this writing , they have found four .",
    "indeed , overall only 51 transiting planets have been found at this time by photometric surveys specifically designed to find planets around bright stars .",
    "this is almost one hundred times less than what was originally predicted by somewhat more sophisticated estimates @xcite .",
    "clearly then , there is something amiss with this method of estimating transiting planet detections .",
    "several other authors have developed more complex models to predict the expected yields of transit surveys .",
    "@xcite examined the potential of all - sky surveys , which was expanded upon and generalized for photometric searches in clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite tested whether the ogle planet detections are statistically consistent with radial velocity planet distributions .",
    "@xcite was the first to make published estimates of the rate of false positives in transit surveys , and @xcite model transit detections to estimate and compare the potential of several ground- and space - based surveys .    as has been recognized by these and other authors , there are four primary reasons why the simple way outlined above of estimating surveys yields fails .",
    "first , the frequency of planets in close orbits about their parent stars ( the planets most likely to show transits ) is likely lower than rv surveys would indicate .",
    "recent examinations of the results from the ogle - iii field by @xcite and @xcite indicate that the frequency of short - period jovian - worlds is on the order of @xmath8 , not @xmath9 as is often assumed by extrapolating from rv surveys @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that most spectroscopic planet searches are usually magnitude limited , which biases the surveys toward more metal - rich stars , which are brighter at fixed color .",
    "these high metallicity stars are expected to have more planets than solar - metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "second , a substantial fraction of the stars within a survey field that show better than 1% photometric precision are either giants or early main - sequence stars that are too large to enable detectable transit dips from a jupiter - sized planet @xcite .",
    "third , robust transit detections usually require more than one transit in the data .",
    "this fact , coupled with the small fraction of the orbit a planet actually spends in transit , and the typical observing losses at single - site locations due to factors such as weather , create low window probabilities for the typical transit survey in the majority of orbital period ranges of interest @xcite .",
    "lastly , requiring better than 1% photometric precision in the data is not a sufficient condition for the successful detection of transits : identifiable transits need to surpass some kind of a detection threshold , such as a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) threshold .",
    "the s / n of the transit signal depends on several factors in addition to the photometric precision of the data , such as the depth of the transit and the number of data points taken during the transit event .",
    "additionally , ground - based photometry typically exhibits substantial auto - correlation in the time series data points , on the timescales of the transits themselves .",
    "this additional red noise , which can come from a number of environmental and instrumental sources , substantially reduces the statistical power of the data @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a method to statistically calculate the number of planets that a given transiting planet survey should be able to detect .",
    "we have done so in a way that maximizes the flexibility of our approach , so that it may be applied in as many circumstances as possible .",
    "therefore , we have allowed for survey - specific quantities such as the observation bandpass to be defined arbitrarily , and have also allowed for our astrophysical assumptions to be easily altered .",
    "we account for factors such as the low frequency of jovian planets , the increased difficulty of detecting transits at high impact parameters , as well as variations in stellar density due to galactic structure and extinction due to interstellar dust .",
    "we also use the present - day mass function to realistically account for the number of main - sequence stars that will be in a given field of view .",
    "we do not treat , or simulate , the distribution and effects of giant stars .",
    "we approximate the detectability of a planetary transit using a s / n formulation .",
    "this differs from the previously published work in the field by virtue of the generalized nature of our approach .",
    "other authors , such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have restricted themselves to modeling specific transit surveys or types of transit surveys .",
    "our approach , which allows for variations such as arbitrary telescope parameters , observing bandpasses , cadences , and fields of view , is not restricted to any one type of transit survey .",
    "indeed , we offer examples of how our method may be applied to the four most frequently used modes for transit searches .",
    "furthermore , we have conducted an extensive literature review of basic astrophysical relations , such as the present day mass - function ( pdmf ) , galactic structure , and the main sequence mass - luminosity relation , and included these in our predictions .",
    "we do not use more complicated ( but presumably more accurate ) galactic models like the besancon model @xcite because these models are less flexible and considerably more time consuming to utilize .",
    "we first describe the mathematical formalism with which we have chosen to address this problem , and then move on to discuss our specific assumptions . as examples",
    ", we then offer our predictions for several different types of photometric surveys : point - and - stare , drift - scanning , space - based , and all - sky . for each ,",
    "we choose a representative survey for that particular mode , and compare our predictions to actual survey results , or to predictions elsewhere in the literature .",
    "we also examine the possible effects of red noise on our predictions , and conclude by discussing what our predictions imply for the general state of photometric transiting planet surveys .",
    "in the most general sense , we can describe the average number of planets that a transit survey should detect as the probability of detecting a transit multiplied by the local stellar mass function , integrated over mass , distance , and the size of the observed field ( described by the galactic coordinates @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the probability that a given star of mass @xmath13 and distance @xmath14 orbited by a planet with radius @xmath15 and period @xmath16 will present a detectable transit to the observing set - up .",
    "@xmath17 is the probability that a star will possess a planet of radius @xmath15 and period @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath18 is the present day mass function in the local solar neighborhood , and @xmath19 is the local stellar density for the three - dimensional position defined by ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we use @xmath21 instead of the usual volume element for spherical coordinates , @xmath22 , because @xmath23 is defined opposite to @xmath24 : @xmath25 occurs at the pole .    first , we will integrate over both planetary radius and orbital period @xmath26 to do this , we must first specify the detection probability @xmath27 , as well as the distribution of planet radius and periods @xmath28 , which we treat in section 2.2 .      the probability",
    "that a planet orbiting a given star shows a detectable transit may be broken up into two separate probabilities : the chance that a planet with radius @xmath15 and period @xmath16 around a star of mass @xmath13 at a distance @xmath14 will transit with a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to be detected , and the window probability that a transit will be visible for the particular observing set - up : @xmath29      to calculate the probability that a planetary system will show detectable transits , we first select the appropriate statistical test to determine whether or not our notional data shows a discernible transit . in the world of transiting planet searches ,",
    "many different methods are used either individually or together to test the statistical significance of a possible transit and alert the researcher to its existence .",
    "for example , the hungarian - made automated telescope network ( hatnet ) uses a combination of the dip significance parameter ( dsp ) and a box - least squares ( bls ) power spectrum ( amongst others ) to test its photometric data . in general",
    "though , whatever test one uses , it is generally the s / n of a transit shape in the observed data is what determines whether or not that transit will be identified as an event .",
    "as the square of the signal - to - noise can be approximated by the @xmath31 test , we therefore chose to use the @xmath31 value to determine if a given transit will be detectable for a set of given observation parameters .",
    "for a specific transit , the @xmath31 statistic , assuming uncorrelated white noise , is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of data points observed in a transit of fractional depth @xmath34 and with fractional standard deviation @xmath35 , assuming a boxcar transit shape with no ingress or egress . to be detected , the transit must have a @xmath31 higher than a certain minimum @xmath36 @xmath37 the fractional depth of the transit is given by the square of the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath38 while this formulation ignores the contributions of stellar limb - darkening to the depth of the transit , @xcite demonstrate that , to a first order approximation , transit detection rates are not affected by limb - darkening .",
    "briefly , they point out that the effects of limb - darkening on the transit lightcurve will be offset by the effects of the planet s ingress and egress from the stellar disk .",
    "therefore , we have not included stellar limb - darkening terms in our calculations .    to determine @xmath35 , we assume poisson statistics , such that for a given exposure with an observed number of @xmath39 source photons from the target star and @xmath40 background photons , @xmath41 where @xmath42 accounts for scintillation as per @xcite , and @xmath39 is defined as @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the efficiency of the overall observing set - up , and can take values from 0 to 1 .",
    "it accounts for photon losses in places such as the filter , the mirrors of the telescope , the ccds , and passage through the atmosphere .",
    "@xmath45 is the source photon flux in the observed bandpass in units of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the exposure time of each observation , and @xmath48 is simply the light collecting area of the telescope .",
    "@xmath45 , the observed photon flux from the source in a certain bandpass , can be defined as a function of the photon luminosity of the source , the distance to the source , and the effects of extinction due to interstellar dust : @xmath49 where @xmath50 accounts for extinction , and will be treated later .",
    "it has the effect of decreasing the number of observed photons from more distant stars , particularly in the bluer bands .",
    "@xmath51 , the photon luminosity of the source star , we set as a function of the stellar mass @xmath13 and the observational bandpass @xmath52 .",
    "we derive this quantity in appendix a , and only note here that we approximate the source stars as blackbodies . while this is a simplification , we show in appendix a that it is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "using @xmath51 in equation ( [ eq:80 ] ) yields the observed photon flux at a distance @xmath14 from that same star .",
    "we thus now have an expression for @xmath39 as a function of the stellar mass , distance , and bandpass choice , that we can use in our calculation of @xmath35 .",
    "we now only need @xmath40 , the number of background photons observed .",
    "similar to equation ( [ eq:70 ] ) , @xmath40 is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the photon surface brightness of the sky at the particular wavelength @xmath52 ( or , in our case , for a specific band ) , and @xmath55 is the effective area of the seeing disk .",
    "assuming that the point - spread function ( psf ) is a gaussian with a full - width half - max ( fwhm ) of @xmath56 arcseconds , @xmath55 is defined by @xmath57 we can now place both of the expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 back into equation ( [ eq:60 ] ) to arrive at a determination of @xmath35 , the photometric uncertainty in the data points .",
    "in certain cases , @xmath39 and @xmath40 will be so great that the ccd detectors of the telescope will be saturated by the number of photons received from a star during the exposure time . in this case ,",
    "further measurements become useless .",
    "mathematically , we may describe saturation as occurring when the number of photons collected by a single ccd pixel during an exposure exceeds the full - well depth ( fwd ) of that pixel : @xmath58 @xmath59 is related to @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath60\\right)\\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{n_b \\theta_{pix}^2}{\\omega } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the angular size of an individual pixel .",
    "the only part of equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) that remains to be defined is the number of data points observed while the system is in transit , @xmath33 . assuming a circular orbit",
    ", we can say that the number of points seen in transit is directly proportional to the fraction of time that the system spends in eclipse , and given a total number of observed data points @xmath62 , @xmath33 is thus @xmath63 where @xmath23 is the impact parameter of the transit in units of the stellar radius , @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the orbital inclination , and we have assumed that @xmath66 .",
    "we note that this does not hold for correlated noise , see @xcite .",
    "taking equation [ eq:160 ] and putting it back into our original formulation for @xmath31 gives @xmath67 we define a new variable , @xmath68 , as the value of equation ( [ eq:170 ] ) when @xmath69 , corresponding to the @xmath31 of an equatorial transit about a given star .",
    "this gives us a new form that makes it easier to determine when a system will have a transit geometry sufficient to be detected by the given observing set - up : @xmath70 rearranging , we find that we are able to detect transits up to a @xmath71 of @xmath72    therefore , @xmath71 is a function of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 as a result of the relations contained within the @xmath68 term .    finally , we can now deduce an explicit expression for @xmath30 .",
    "given that detectable transits can only occur between @xmath73 , we may simply integrate the normalized probability density function of allowable impact parameters from 0 to @xmath71 to find a value for @xmath30 .    given that @xmath74 , the maximum value of the impact parameter for a circular orbit ( different from the maximum at which we will detect transits ) is @xmath75 .",
    "the normalization for the impact parameter s probability density function is therefore @xmath76 since impact parameters are uniformly distributed is uniform , which follows from the assumption that planetary systems are randomly oriented .",
    "the distribution of @xmath77 may be derived by considering the normalized angular momentum vector of the planetary orbit , which is free to point in any direction , and thus has a parameter space that forms an imaginary sphere around the parent star .",
    "particular values of @xmath77 are `` hoops '' along the surface of this sphere , and the ratio of their area to that of the total sphere is the probability that @xmath77 will take that value . ] , this gives the solution @xmath78 .",
    "it should be noted that this form of @xmath79 is only valid in the case of circular orbits . for",
    "the period ranges probed so far by transit surveys , this is not a very restrictive assumption , since only @xmath80 of the known transiting planets have eccentricities inconsistent with zero . at longer periods , however , the effects of eccentricity must be considered @xcite .",
    "if we now integrate this over the range of impact parameters that yield detectable transits , we find @xmath81      the window probability ( or window function ) for a transit survey describes the probability that a transiting planet with a certain period will be visible to the survey , given the observational cadence of the survey ( i.e. - x hours of observing per night for y nights ) . while many numerical routines exist that can exactly calculate the window probability for a given observing set - up , for our purposes calculating an exact numerical answer is generally too time intensive to be practical .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    we therefore developed an analytical framework that allows for the approximate calculation of a window probability .",
    "this has the virtue of requiring much less computing time .",
    "this is gained at the cost of a small loss of accuracy .",
    "we give a full description of our analytic window probability in appendix b. briefly , we assume randomly sampled observations , which leads to simple expressions for the average window probability .",
    "this implicitly ignores the effects of aliasing at integer and half - integer day periods .",
    "thus we are not able to address issues related to non - uniform or biased _ a posteriori _ distributions of planet parameters resulting from the effect of aliasing ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the analytic solution does follow the `` outline '' of the exact calculations , and closely tracks the moving average value of the exact calculations sufficiently accurately for our purposes , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath83 denotes the probability that a given star has a planet with radius @xmath15 and orbital period @xmath16 . in the example surveys that we consider later",
    ", we chose to focus on the detection of short period very hot- and hot - jupiters ( vhjs and hjs ) with orbital periods of 1 to 5 days , as this is the regime being probed by these surveys .",
    "the exception of this focus is the kepler survey , where we also examine the detectability of transiting planets over a range of radii and orbital periods . in both cases , we consider a fixed planet radius , so that @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the correct normalization for a given period range , @xmath86 is the distribution within this range , and @xmath87 is the planet radius .",
    "for vhjs and hjs we use @xmath88 , the average radius of the transiting planets found to date . in general , we have left the exact distribution of @xmath86 to be assigned as is deemed appropriate . for the vhj and hj period distributions described above ,",
    "we adopt a distribution that is uniform in period , @xmath89 .    the frequency of hot jupiters ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) is commonly taken to be @xmath92 from the results of the rv planet surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , adopting frequencies from rv surveys can lead to biased estimates of the expected yields from transit surveys , because rv surveys constrain the frequency of planets as a function of mass , rather than radius .",
    "furthermore , as argued by @xcite , most rv surveys are more metallicity biased than transit surveys , and therefore the planet frequency found by rv surveys will be correspondingly higher , since planet occurrence is an increasing function of metallicity @xcite .",
    "rv surveys are metallicity biased because the target samples for these surveys are magnitude - limited . since metal rich stars are brighter at fixed color , they are overrepresented in magnitude - limited samples with respect to a volume - limited sample @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite note that because they use a magnitude - limited target list , their target stars have a definite metallicity bias .",
    "transit surveys , on the other hand , are typically signal - to - noise ratio limited . at fixed color ,",
    "metal - rich stars are both brighter and bigger .",
    "these two effects on the signal - to - noise ratio roughly cancel , and as a result transit surveys are very weakly biased with respect to metallicity ( see section 8.1 of @xcite for a quantitative discussion . )    indeed , there is evidence for the effects of this metallicity bias in the comparison of various surveys . from the california and carnegie keck magnitude - limited and metallicity - biased @xcite survey sample ,",
    "@xcite find a frequency of @xmath93 for planets with @xmath94 and @xmath95 . on the other hand , for the volume - limited @xcite coralie sample , @xcite report a frequency of @xmath96 for @xmath95 and @xmath97 @xmath98 . assuming that @xmath99 of these planets have @xmath90",
    ", this corresponds to a frequency of 0.6% for @xmath90 and @xmath95 , a factor of @xmath100 lower than that found for the keck rv survey .",
    "@xcite examined the ogle - iii transit survey , and found a frequency of @xmath101 for @xmath90 , which was subsequently confirmed and strengthened by @xcite .",
    "thus , as would be expected based on the arguments above , the frequencies inferred from transit surveys and volume - limited rv surveys are similar ( and entirely consistent considering poisson uncertainties and uncertainties in the mass - radius relation of giant planets ) , whereas they are substantially lower than the frequencies inferred from magnitude - limited ( and metallicity - biased ) rv surveys .    for the vhj and hj predictions that we later make using tres , xo , and kepler",
    ", we will adopt the normalizations from @xcite of @xmath102 for vhjs with orbital periods uniformly distributed between 1 - 3 days , and @xmath103 for hjs uniformly distributed between 3 - 5 day periods . by using statistics from ogle - iii , instead of the rv statistics , we are avoiding the difficulties discussed above , and furthermore any unaccounted - for biases inherent in photometric surveys will be preserved , and therefore any systematic effects unknown to us will still be accurately captured in the final predictions . in other words , it is an `` apples - to - apples '' comparison , instead of `` apples - to - oranges '' using rv data .",
    "the next step is to integrate equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) over mass : @xmath104    having previously derived an expression for @xmath27 , we need only determine the appropriate formulation for the pdmf , @xmath105 . using the results of @xcite , who used the hipparcos data sets along with their own data from the palomar / michigan state university survey to create a volume - limited survey out to 25 pc , we adopt @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the appropriate normalization constant .",
    "a fuller discussion for our decision to use this particular form for the pdmf is in appendix c.    adopting a stellar mass density in the solar neighborhood of @xmath108 @xcite , we find a normalization of @xmath109 .",
    "while our normalization of the mass function properly describes the density of stars in the solar neighborhood , beyond about 100 pc we must account for variations in stellar density due to galactic structure .",
    "additionally , as mentioned previously , we must also take into consideration the effects of extinction due to interstellar dust .",
    "this is the final stage of integration that needs to be done on equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) : @xmath110      we adopt the bahcall & soneira model for the galactic thin disk @xcite .",
    "the model treats stellar density in the thin disk as a double exponential function involving both the distance from the galactic center and height above the galactic plane .",
    "specifically , the mass density relative to the local density is given by @xmath111,\\ ] ] where @xmath112 kpc is the distance from the galactic center .",
    "@xmath113 is the scale length , and @xmath114 is the scale height .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath115 for the scale length of the disk . for the vertical scale height ,",
    "we use the following relation , which is a slightly modified form of that originally proposed by @xcite : @xmath116 we calculate the absolute v - band magnitudes of stars of a given mass using the blackbody assumptions , and the mass - radius and mass - luminosity relations described in appendix a.    we defer the complete discussion of our reasoning behind our choices for @xmath113 and @xmath114 to appendix d. the exact values for these parameters are not well constrained in the literature , and we show the effects of using different values in the appendix .",
    "we note that within the range of values found in the literature , the final prediction results may differ by as much as 20% .",
    "we only treat the thin disk in our modeling because we decided that an expanded analysis that also looked at stars in the thick disk , halo , and bulge would not add a significant number of detections to our final result .",
    "both the thick disk and the halo have much lower volume densities than the thin disk at distances typically surveyed by transit searches . in the same vein ,",
    "the bulge is too far away .",
    "these populations are also typically older than the thin disk , and so have a fainter turn - off point , meaning that these stars are more difficult to detect .",
    "that being said , for deeper transit surveys , such as some of the all - sky surveys , these populations may play an interesting role . in that case",
    ", it would be fairly simple to add them into our model .",
    "we chose the bahcall model instead of other more detailed models due to speed and portability considerations .",
    "while others , such as the besancon models @xcite , take into account features such as density variations from the spiral structure of the galaxy and the galactic bulge , they typically require over 30 minutes to simulate a given star field . additionally , many are only accessible through webpage interfaces , and therefore difficult to include in a self - contained prediction algorithm .",
    "we do note that comparisons between our galactic model and the besancon model revealed star count differences of only 10% in the kepler and tres fields over a range of magnitude limits .",
    "we also model the density of interstellar dust as a double exponential @xmath117.\\ ] ] which gives the dust density at a distance @xmath14 along a particular line of sight ( @xmath118 ) relative to the density in the solar neighborhood ( i.e. - @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) . to calculate the extinction in a given bandpass for a star at a given distance",
    ", we then integrate equation ( [ eq:290 ] ) over @xmath14 to arrive at the effective path length through an equivalent solar neighborhood dust density , @xmath121 the v - band extinction in magnitudes , @xmath122 , is given by this path length multiplied by the appropriate normalization constant : @xmath123 .",
    "we adopt @xmath124 mag kpc@xmath125 @xcite .",

    "it is important to keep in mind that in the preceding derivations , we made several assumptions about the nature of extrasolar planetary systems , as well as some simplifications to keep the math and computing time more manageable .",
    "_ detectability is best measured through @xmath31 : _ while s / n is a better metric than photometric precision to determine if a transit will be detectable , and the @xmath31 parameter is a good proxy for s / n , actual transit surveys use a wide variety of tests to detect transits .",
    "many tests , such as the visual evaluation of the data by a human being , are difficult to simulate numerically .",
    "thus , using just a @xmath31 test is a simplification , as human inspection may impose a much higher effective s / n threshold .",
    "as we show for typical surveys , the number of detections is a strong function of the s / n threshold .",
    "thus a proper determination of the effective s / n threshold imposed by all cuts is necessary before any robust conclusions can be drawn about the rate of detections relative to expectations .",
    "this is a fundamental - and unavoidable - limitation of our study .",
    "_ no stellar limb - darkening : _ we have neglected to include terms for stellar limb - darkening because , as stated above , to first - order its effects are canceled by the the effects of ingress and egress on the transit lightcurve @xcite .",
    "_ stars are blackbodies : _ we assume that the radiated energy of a star can be described as a blackbody . while in general this is a fair approximation ( to within 0.5 mag , see figures 11 and 12 ) , it does not hold true for the bluer bandpasses we consider ( u - band in particular ) and for very low - mass stars .",

    "_ no binary systems : _ while we only consider main sequence stars , we do not model the statistics of binary systems ; in our formulation all stars are treated as single . though this is clearly not the case , it was outside the scope of this project to go deeply into binary frequencies , the ability of planets to form in such systems , and whether or not such planets would be detectable .    however",
    ", we can make a rough estimate of the expected magnitude of the effect of binaries .",
    "first , we assume that 1/3 of our stars have no binary companion @xcite .",
    "we assume the remaining 2/3 of the stars are in binary systems .",
    "a typical wide - field survey has a psf size of @xmath128 , which corresponds to a separation of @xmath129 , and a period of @xmath130 for an equal - mass solar - mass binary . adopting the period distribution for binary stars from @xcite",
    ", we estimate that @xmath131 of the binary systems are unresolved . of these unresolved binaries ,",
    "we conservatively assume that those with separations @xmath132 , or @xmath133 , do not host hot jupiters because the binary components are too close .",
    "thus we estimate that @xmath134 of unresolved binaries can host hot jupiters . to estimate the detectability of transiting planets in these , consider a binary where @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 are the flux , radius , and mass of the primary ( `` 1 '' ) and secondary ( `` 2 '' ) , respectively .",
    "additionally , define @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "then , for fixed planet radius and semimajor axis , assuming photon - limited uncorrelated uncertainties , the signal - to - noise ratios if the stars are resolved are @xmath144 and @xmath145 , while if the stars are unresolved the signal - to - noise ratios for transits across each component are @xmath146 and @xmath147 . assuming a constant volume density of stars and no interstellar extinction , the number of detected planets scales as @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "thus the number of planet detections for a population of binaries in the unblended case can be written as @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the mass ratio distribution .",
    "similarly , for the blended case , this is @xmath151 .",
    "using the scalings for the signal - to - noise ratios just derived , we evaluate the ratio of the number of detections in the blended case , relative to the number of detections one would expect if they were unblended , @xmath152 we adopt @xmath153 , which is roughly appropriate for the @xmath154-band ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , and @xmath155 ( eq .  [ eq:121 ] ) .",
    "we consider two different distributions for @xmath150 .",
    "first , we adopt @xmath150 from @xcite , which is weighted toward low mass ratio systems .",
    "second , we consider a distribution with a substantial population of ` twins ' with @xmath156 .",
    "specifically , we choose @xmath157 $ ] , with @xmath158 , which approximates the distribution found by @xcite .",
    "when we then average equation ( [ eq:291 ] ) over @xmath159 , weighting by @xmath150 , we find @xmath160 for the @xcite mass ratio distribution , and @xmath161 for the @xcite mass ratio distribution .",
    "thus , we estimate that roughly 70 - 90% of planets in unresolved binaries will still be detectable .",
    "the basic point is that , because the mass - luminosity relation is so steep , only those binaries that have @xmath162 result in a substantial reduction in the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "low mass ratio companions have little affect on the ability to detect transit signals . for the mass ratio distribution of @xcite ,",
    "these provide the bulk of the companion population , and so in this case the effects of binarity are suppressed even further .",
    "finally , we can summarize these various components to provide a rough estimate of the fraction of planets that will be detected when we consider binary systems , relative to our fiducial assumption that all stars are single .",
    "we find @xmath163 .",
    "thus we expect that our estimated yields are systematically high by at most @xmath164 .",
    "this is generally of order or smaller than other sources of uncertainty in our predicted yields .",
    "we note that a corollary of our assertion that binaries have a small effect on the yields of transit surveys is that a substantial fraction of the planets that have been found in wide - field transit surveys should be in binary systems .",
    "only two planets in confirmed common proper - motion binary systems have been reported @xcite , however systematic surveys for stellar companions to the host stars of the known transiting planets have not been performed , and therefore the true incidence of binary systems amongst the sample of transiting planets is not known .",
    "using the preceding formalism , we simulated four different surveys modes used by transit searches : point - and - stare , drift - scanning , space - based , and all - sky surveys .",
    "for the point - and - stare and drift - scanning cases , we use the tres and xo transit surveys as our examples , respectively .",
    "both surveys have been successful in their hunt for planets , and so we are able to directly compare the results of our calculations with the actual number of detections . for vhjs and hjs , we simulate the detection of planets with @xmath165 , and with the period distribution from @xcite that we describe in section 2.2 .",

    "secondly , the value we use for the extinction ratio in the kepler bandpass , @xmath222 , is an average that we calculated by integrating the extinction curve over the kepler bandpass ( 400 - 850 nm ) @xcite .",
    "finally , the kepler website and much of the literature states that kepler will use a dim magnitude cutoff of @xmath223 . in reality",
    ", there is no `` hard '' magnitude cutoff at which stars will be excluded from observations .",
    "indeed , kepler is expected to observe promising stars that are much dimmer than @xmath224 ( d. w. latham , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , for our more explicit calculations of the expected number of hj and vhj detections for kepler , we adjusted the magnitude limit such that the number of stars in the field agreed with the expected number of kepler targets ( 100,000 in the case of the new field ) . for other , more general , simulations",
    ", we used several different magnitude limits to determine what effects these had on kepler s expected detections .",
    "while the location of the kepler field is currently centered on galactic coordinates @xmath225 , up until 2004 it was instead situated closer to the galactic plane at @xmath226 .",
    "the switch in the position of the field to higher galactic latitudes was done in order to avoid sorting through the larger number of giant stars that are found in fields directed along the plane of the galaxy .",
    "much of the previously published literature examining the kepler mission have used the coordinates of the old field . for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we therefore simulated both the old and new kepler fields .",
    "-0.15 in -0.15 in    looking in the new kepler field with a magnitude limit of @xmath223 , we simulated the number of detections as a function of orbital period for jupiter- , earth- , and mars - sized worlds , assuming that every star possessed a planet with the given period and radius ( figure 4 ) , and that red noise was negligible .",
    "interestingly , the difference between the number jupiter- and earth - sized planets detected is minimal for @xmath227 days , which indicates that kepler is able to detect all the planets within this radius range , assuming that they transit .",
    "therefore , for @xmath228 and @xmath227 days , the s / n of transiting jupiter- and earth - sized planets is large enough that kepler s s / n limit is irrelevant , and the @xmath223 magnitude cutoff is the limiting factor in the number of detections . for smaller planets the size of mars ,",
    "the s / n of their transits are in the neighborhood of the kepler s / n limit for the brightest stars and shorter periods , and so mars - sized worlds are detected at a much lower rate .",
    "-0.0 in -0.1 in    to more accurately characterize the magnitude- and s / n - limited detection regimes , we plotted the number of detections as a function of planetary radius for orbital periods of 1 day and 365 days ( figure 5 ) .",
    "in addition in a magnitude limit of @xmath224 , we also plot the same relations for a limit of @xmath229 .",
    "one can clearly see the flattening of these curves as the radius of the target planets increase , indicating the increasing effect of the magnitude limit on the detection numbers .",
    "as is expected in the s / n limited regime , detections go as @xmath230 @xcite , though at the lower end saturation of the kepler ccds serves to cut out some of these detections .",
    "one of the major goals of the kepler mission is the detection of planets in a star s habitable zone that would be capable of supporting life .",
    "the habitable zone is defined as the distance from the parent star at which liquid water water could exist on a planet s surface .",
    "we estimate the detection rate of habitable zone planets by assuming that all stars have a planet with a semi - major axis equal to @xmath231    this assumption is simple and likely optimistic . in reality",
    ", the habitable zone has a finite width , and habitable planets will have a range of radii .",
    "thus , a better estimate would be to adopt a distribution of planet masses and radii , and integrate over the range of radii and periods considered habitable .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of one habitable planet per star is probably optimistic , and so the actual number of detected habitable earths will be smaller than we estimate , depending on the real frequency of earth - like planets . for the sake of simplicity , however , we will adopt the assumptions above .    with this assumption , we simulated the detection of habitable earths in both the old and new kepler fields ( figure 6 ) .",
    "surprisingly , despite there being nearly twice as many main sequence stars in the old field , the number of detected habitable earths remained nearly the same in the two fields .",
    "this occurred because at the magnitude relevant for kepler , the increased star count in the old field was mainly due to the larger number of a and f main - sequence stars found closer to the galactic plane ; habitable planets are doubly hard to detect around these stars due to the lessened depth of transit , and the longer periods required for a planet to be in the habitable zone .",
    "the exact distribution of stars by spectral type for the old and new fields is given in table 13 , and is discussed further below . for the 106,000 stars in the new kepler field , we find that kepler will be able to detect 79 habitable earth radius planets , assuming that every star posses one .",

    "this corresponded to a magnitude limit of @xmath234 in the new field and @xmath235 in the old field .",

    "this has the effect of `` doubling '' the number of planets we expect kepler to detect ( as demonstrated by the final values in parentheses in table 14 ) .",
    "we therefore arrive at detection rates for vhjs and hjs that are 2/3 that of jd03 for the old kepler field , and 1/3 that of jd03 in the new kepler field . for the old field , we predict 54.2 vhjs and 72.8 hjs . for the new field ,",

    "indeed , to date the wide - angle surveys have generated approximately 15 false positive candidates for every actual transiting planet they have seen ( d. w. latham , private communication ) .",
    "if we extend this ratio to lsst , sdss - ii , pan - starrs and pan - starrs wide , we would expect them to create 116,000 , 90 , 290 , and 720 false positives , respectively around sun - like stars , and 233,000 , 180 , 550 , and 1,200 around m - dwarfs , respectively .",

    "we would therefore expect the all - sky surveys , despite the high absolute number of predicted detections , to discover transiting planets at about the same rate as the operational wide - angle surveys , as the identification rate is predominantly limited by the ability to make follow - up observations of candidates to determine whether or not it is a false positive .      as pointed out by @xcite , the general mathematical description we have used for the s / n of a transit , equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) , assumes uncorrelated errors on the collected photometric data points ( white noise ) . in practice this may not be the case , as phenomenon such as changes in the seeing , airmass , telescope tracking , etc . introduce systematic trends into the observed data that are correlated on the timescales of transits ( red noise ) .",

    "a red noise of 3 mmag would cause an even further reduction in detections , down 60% as compared to white noise .",
    "we also examined the possible effect that red noise would have on the yield of habitable earth - radius planets from kepler mission . given that kepler is a space - based mission designed to detect transit signals with fractional depths at the level of @xmath272 , we would expect that the amount of red noise due to instrumental and environmental sources would be small , if it exists at all . however , this is generally difficult to predict before launch",
    ". furthermore , there may exist significant astrophysical red noise due to intrinsic variability .",
    "we therefore estimated the expected kepler yield for a set of three values for @xmath262 , assuming that every star has an earth - radius planet with @xmath273 ( table 20 ) .",
    "for a relatively large amount of red noise at @xmath274 , we find the number of habitable earths - radius is drastically reduced from our baseline ( uncorrelated noise ) prediction , from 78.89 down to 14.37 .",
    "this is not surprising , since earth passing in front of a sun - like star has a transit depth of only @xmath275 . for this amount of red noise ,",
    "kepler is restricted to detecting earth - like planets only around k- and m - dwarfs .",
    "this shifts the expected distribution of host stars towards dimmer magnitudes ( figure 6 ) . for smaller values of @xmath276 and @xmath277 ,",
    "the number of habitable earths detected is reduced to 32.53 and 72.88 , respectively .",
    "both of these estimates also assume that every target star has an earth - sized planet in the habitable zone , and therefore must be viewed as upper limits .",
    "thus we conclude that kepler s yield of habitable zones of habitable planets will be not be strongly affected by red noise , provided that the red noise is @xmath278 on the timescales of the transits , which is @xmath279 for solar - type stars .",
    "if the red noise is found to be larger than this , it may compromise the primary kepler science by significantly reducing the number of expected habitable planet detections .",
    "for example , if the red noise is @xmath280 , and the frequency of habitable planets with @xmath281 is @xmath282 , there is a @xmath283 chance that kepler will not detect any .",
    "the effects of red noise on the habitable planet yield can be mitigated by including a larger number of k and m dwarfs in the target sample .",
    "of course , it will also be possible to extrapolate the frequency of shorter - period or more massive planets , where the effects of red noise are mitigated , into the habitable zone .",
    "in this paper we have developed a method to more accurately predict the number of transiting planets detectable by wide - field ground- and space - based photometric surveys .",
    "we have taken into account such factors as the frequency of gas giants around main sequence stars , the probability of transits , stellar density changes from galactic structure , and the effects of interstellar extinction .",
    "we adopt a s / n detection threshold criterion to approximate the detectability of planetary transits .    to test our model , we compared our predictions to two operating photometric surveys , tres and xo . for both , we calculated the number of statistically expected detections , as well as the population characteristics of the host stars . for tres ,",
    "we overestimate the number of detections ( thirteen versus the four actual detections ) , while for xo our simulations yield approximately the actual number of detections ( two predicted versus three actual ) .",
    "the exact reason for the discrepancy between our predictions and the actual tres results could be one of many . as we discuss in the tres section , from the properties of the known tres planets , it may be that the survey has a brighter magnitude cut off than the one we use in our fiducial case . if this were the case , and we changed the magnitude limit from @xmath284 to @xmath198 , the number of expected detections would drop to 8.16 from 13 .",
    "red noise also has the potential to substantially affect tres ; a specific estimate of the magnitude of red - noise in the tres survey would be worthwhile .    indeed , it is generally hard to draw specific statistical conclusions from the comparison of our results and those of the transit surveys because they typically do not adopt the strict detection criteria we have used .",
    "promising planet candidates are often followed up even if they are beyond the stated s / n or magnitude limits of the survey .",
    "understanding and quantifying how the survey teams select candidates is vital to appropriately deriving the statistical properties of extrasolar planets .",
    "indeed , tables 4 - 6 and 9 - 11 demonstrate that the actual predictions depend crucially on the specific magnitude and s / n threshold used .",
    "as more transiting planets are discovered , these statistical properties are increasingly becoming the frontier of research , shifting the focus of the field away from individual detections .",
    "given that transiting planets are so far one of the only ways that we may infer the radius of extrasolar planets and their exact orbital properties , the statistical characteristics of this group of objects is one of the only foreseeable ways that the areas of planetary interiors , system dynamics , migration , and formation will acquire more data .",
    "in the future , besides using the preceding formalism to design more efficient transit surveys , we would hope that a more systematic approach towards transit surveys will allow this model to be used to make more specific statistical comparisons . as the number of known transiting planets grows",
    ", we would also expect that this formalism will be used to test different distributions of planet frequencies , periods , and radii against those observational results .",

    "the photon luminosity in a bandpass of a given star of a given mass is calculated exactly by dividing the planck radiation law for wavelength by the energy of a photon at that wavelength , multiplying the result by the surface area of the star , and then integrating over the wavelength range of the relevant bandpass : @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the planck law , and @xmath287 is the energy of a photon .",
    "note that this assumes that stellar radiation can be approximated as a blackbody , a crude assumption that still suffices for our purposes , as we show below .",

    "we chose to treat both as functions of the mass of the source star , as this is an independent variable that allows the use of the present day mass function to describe the general stellar population .    using stellar data from @xcite and @xcite , we fit broken power laws for both the @xmath296 and @xmath297 relations . for the mass - radius relation ,",
    "we fit for two breaks in the power law , while the fitting for the mass - luminosity relation was accomplished using only one break .",

    ", however , is how well these relations allow for the calculation of the effective temperature of a star at a given mass using ( [ eq:111 ] ) , as this feeds directly into the determination of the photon luminosity in a given band .",
    "figure 10 shows a plot of our mass vs. temperature relation along with data points from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , we also show the analytical relation provided by @xcite .",
    "one can see that our formulation of ( [ eq:121 ] ) and ( [ eq:131 ] ) affords a close approximation to both the data and the relation provided by @xcite .    substituting back into ( [ eq:101 ] ) allows us to calculate the photon luminosity of the source star , as well as the absolute magnitude of the source star in various bandpasses .",
    "if we compare these calculated absolute magnitudes in different bands for various stellar masses against empirical magnitudes for those same masses ( figures 11 and 12 ) we can see that the two relations are similar , to within half a magnitude , especially in longer wavelengths .",
    "shorter wavelength bands such as u , b , and to a certain extent v , have calculated magnitudes that diverge from the empirical relation below about a solar mass , which is an unfortunate effect of using blackbody relations to determine the photon luminosity , as in these higher energy bands stellar spectra increasingly do not look like black bodies .",
    "nevertheless , the blackbody assumption is sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "roughly , if we ignore the effects of aliasing , we may say that the window probability of seeing a minimum of @xmath300 transits of a planet with orbital period @xmath16 over the course of @xmath301 nights may be broken up into four different regimes .    first , if the average number of transits during the total time during which the target star is observed exceeds @xmath300 , then it is statistically `` certain '' that the transit will occur during the times of observation .",
    "second , it may be that the entire length of the survey is long enough that there are at least @xmath300 transits , but that during the total time spent observing the average number of transits is less than that required for detection .",
    "then one is not certain to detect @xmath300 transits , and there is a decreasing window probability ( for increasing planet period ) .",
    "third , one may have @xmath300 transits during an observing run , but only if the first transit occurs sufficiently early during that particular run .",
    "the probability of detecting the system then decreases at an even greater rate as the orbital period increases .",
    "finally , the orbital period of system may be so great that there is no possible way in which one could see the minimum number of transits required for a detection , and @xmath302 .",
    "mathematically then , @xmath303 where @xmath304 day .",
    "@xmath305 is the average number of transits that will be seen during the time spent observing , and is given simply by : @xmath306 @xmath307 is defined as the total number of `` good '' observing nights in a particular run , and may mathematically be described as @xmath308 , where @xmath309 is the number of nights lost due to weather , technical problems , or other issues .",
    "@xmath310 is the length of each night s observing time .",
    "alternatively , one may simply view the quantity @xmath311 as the total amount of good observing time in a given run .    to test the accuracy of our formulation , we integrated and found the average window probability for both the analytic and exact formulations linearly averaged over several period ranges ( 1 - 3 , 3 - 5 , and 5 - 10 days ) .",
    "these are shown as a function of total observing nights under different viewing scenarios in figure 13 .",
    "one can see that as a result of the analytic solution not taking into account aliasing , there is divergence between the two solutions as the analytic form approaches unity , as well as in the cases requiring a minimum of three transits .",
    "a review of the literature shows that while there is agreement that the pdmf beyond @xmath312 can be treated as a power law with a slope of @xmath313 , below a solar mass this agreement breaks down .",
    "this is because the low - mass end of the mass - function is unfortunately not as well constrained as it is for higher mass stars , reflecting the difficulty of observing dim m - dwarfs , as well as uncertainties in the mass - luminosity function @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite , who used the hipparcos data sets along with their own data from the palomar / michigan state university ( pmsu ) survey to create a volume - limted sample out to 25 pc , propose a traditional power law formulation of the pdmf : @xmath314 with @xmath315 for @xmath316 , and @xmath317 for @xmath318 , and @xmath319 as the correct normalization .    in a recent review ,",
    "meanwhile , @xcite argues for a log - normal function below a solar mass : @xmath320,\\ ] ] with @xmath321 , @xmath322 , and @xmath323 .    for comparison ,",
    "if we normalize both to the @xcite normalization for 5 gyr of @xmath324 and plot the two functions against each other ( figure 14 ) , we can clearly see the divergence both numerically and functionally of these two forms below a solar mass .",
    "interestingly however , for most surveys this divergence makes little difference in the final number of predicted detections : typically reid s relation gives only 3% fewer detections than chabrier s does , if both are normalized at a solar mass .",
    "that this difference is so small comes from the fact that most wide - angle surveys are not sensitive to detections around stars with @xmath325 .",
    "hence , the region of greatest uncertainty in the pdmf is left unseen by these surveys .    since the difference between the two relations is small , and because the data set used by @xcite is much more recent than that used by @xcite , we therefore chose to use the @xcite form of the pdmf .    for the purpose of comparing the reid and chabrier pdmfs in figure 14 , we normalized both to the value given by @xcite .",
    "going forward , however , we change the normalization to the integrated mass density found observationally by @xcite of @xmath108 .",
    "the values for the scale length and scale height of the galactic disk that we use in our modeling are @xmath115 and @xmath114 as a function of absolute magnitude .",
    "specifically , we calculate the vertical scale height of the disk as : @xmath326 which is a modified form of the relation found in @xcite , who instead used a value of 320 pc for the scale height of stars with @xmath327 .    the large uncertainties in the value of the scale length of the disk reflects the uncertainty in the relevant literature . in their initial paper ,",
    "@xcite use @xmath328 . since then various sources have proposed an even @xmath329 @xcite ,",
    "have covered all the bases by using several values between @xmath330 @xcite , and have given the very exact result of @xmath331 @xcite .    to see what effect different scale lengths have on our final detection numbers , we simulated observations of a @xmath332 field along the galactic plane at intervals of @xmath333 in galactic longitude , as well as fixing the galactic longitude at certain points ( @xmath202 , @xmath334 , and @xmath335 ) and varying the latitude of the fields .",
    "figure 15 shows these results for scale lengths of 2 , 2.5 , and 3 kpc . at the extremes ( directly towards or directly away from the galactic core ) the 2 and 3 kpc scale lengths differ by only 0.15 detections per field .",
    "we chose 2.5 kpc not only to split this difference , but also because more recent results place the scale length much lower than earlier 3 kpc estimates [ e.g. - @xcite ] .    in the case of the scale height of the galactic disk",
    ", the literature divides between those who derive the scale height from optical star counts and those who rely on near - infrared observations . in the optical case ,",
    "the scale height is presented as a function of absolute visual magnitude that varies from 90 pc to values between 250 - 320 pc .",
    "the near - infrared observations , on the other hand , lead to one single value of the scale height , generally around 290 pc .",
    "this happens because measurements in the infrared are dominated by older m - dwarfs that have dispersed in an even fashion away from the galactic plane .    to compare these different estimates ,",
    "we have plotted the number of detections in a @xmath332 field along @xmath336 as a function of galactic latitude in figure 16 .",
    "we used two of the optically - derived scale height relations , as well as a constant scale height of 290 pc .",
    "one of the optical relations , the bahcall model , is given by @xmath337    the other optical model is taken from allen s astrophysical quantities ( aaq ) @xcite and is : @xmath338    also plotted in figure 16 are the number of detections above and below @xmath339 for the three different scale height relations , as well as the residuals of the constant 290 pc and the aaq relation against the bahcall formulation .",
    "the exact choice of how the galactic scale height is treated leads to rather different final predictions .",
    "specifically , while the optical relations are similar , the constant 290 pc scale height from near - infrared observations leads to substantially more detections around stars with @xmath340 .    for our predictions",
    ", we have adopted the form of the @xcite and allen s astrophysical quantities scale height relations .",
    "we find the gradated scale height in these models appealing , because it accounts for the fact that more luminous stars with shorter lifetimes should not be dispersed far away from star - forming regions in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the constant 290 pc relation , because it is based on near - infrared data , reflects the sensitivity of those observations to less massive stars that are brighter in longer wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , we have used the 290 pc result as our value for the scale height of late - type stars with @xmath341 , in contrast to the values used in the aaq and bahcall models .",
    "as per equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) , we have @xmath342    for the all - sky surveys that we are considering , the number of in - transit data points observed is simply the number of data points acquired in each field multiplied by the fraction of time a planet will spend in transit during its orbit : @xmath343 where @xmath344 is the total observation time of the survey , @xmath345 is solid angle of the survey telescope s field of view , and @xmath346 is the total solid angle of the sky covered by the survey .      for poisson , source - noise dominated errors , we have @xmath348 where @xmath349 is the total number of photons from the source collected during @xmath47 .",
    "we can then write , @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the fiducial fractional photometric uncertainty achieved for a star with apparent magnitude @xmath352 using a telescope with diameter @xmath353 and an exposure time of @xmath354 .",
    "we have defined @xmath355 as the efficiency of the observing setup relative to the fiducial case . if we rearrange equation ( [ eq:480 ] ) to @xmath356 }",
