    "every person has unique preferences that form the basis of the person s decision - making and consequent behaviors .",
    "however , when requested to describe the details of a preference that results in a behavior of particular interest to others , the person often fails to verbally explain .",
    "the person is not aware of all aspects of the preference . by understanding such unconscious influences",
    ", the person s private and social lifestyles can be re - designed @xcite .",
    "if they know the consumers unconscious preferences , vendors can turn to new concepts , unfamiliar products , and emerging services to reach the consumers @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to develop methods to help a person become aware of his or her unconscious preferences and convey them to others in the form of verbal explanation .",
    "various methods have been proposed in marketing to help us understand and foresee individual consumers behavior .",
    "conjoint analysis is used to discover the optimal combination of factors that customers would prefer @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical bayes model is employed to treat the different personalities of individual consumers .",
    "this model is applied to the investigation of the non - primary aspects of individual consumers demand @xcite .",
    "a number of studies on latent class models ( or latent trait models ) address latent variables and their statistical testing @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these models are applied to test hypotheses on the factors in the consumers preferences .",
    "they can not , however , be used to discover unknown factors hidden in unconscious preferences .",
    "reflection in cognitive science @xcite and computer - mediated communication @xcite are theoretical guides to approach unconscious preferences .",
    "the abilities to recognize and understand oneself , discover something unexpected , and create something new are founded on constructive perception @xcite , @xcite .",
    "constructive perception is the ability to perceive the visual characteristics of elements , the relationships between the elements , and the empty relevant space between the elements in diagrams , sketches , or drawings @xcite .",
    "visualization and verbalization play important roles in becoming aware of a person s present perception , and in changing it .",
    "perception is a process used to interpret sensory signals from the outside .",
    "for example , drawing for reflection , which records a designer s daily intermediate outcomes , was proven to be an effective tool in a university education program of creativity @xcite .",
    "a practical tool based on the theory of constructive perception is needed , like the drawings for designers , which can help a person s reflective visualization and verbalization of that person s unconscious preferences .",
    "methods of discovery in other fields can be applied to the discovery of unconscious preference .",
    "for example , in social network analysis , a heuristic method was developed to solve a node discovery problem .",
    "its aim is to discover an unknown relevant person hidden in a criminal organization @xcite .",
    "the person is not found in the records of observed actions but plays a relevant role in organizational communication and decision - making @xcite .",
    "the method is implemented as an iterative process where the discrepancy between prior understanding and observation is indicated in the form of a social network diagram @xcite .",
    "other methods of discovery are link prediction @xcite , discovery of hierarchies @xcite , cluster discovery @xcite , and exploration of unknown structures @xcite .",
    "incorporating insights from the cognitive sciences would help to develop such a discovery process for treating unconscious preferences .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop a method that can help a person become aware of his or her unconscious preferences .",
    "the method combines the concepts of reflection , visualization ( with an algorithm to draw the subject s stated preference in a diagram ) , and verbalization ( through group discussion ) .",
    "the method is described in section [ method ] ( with the preference diagram in [ preference ] , the visualization algorithm in [ visualization ] , and the reflection process in [ reflection ] ) .",
    "the experiment of testing the reflection process to investigate the unconscious preferences of subjects with artwork and the lessons learned from it are presented in section [ experiment ] .",
    "a preference diagram is a practical tool that can be used to promote the reflective visualization and verbalization of unconscious preferences .",
    "it also aids in efficient communication and mutual understanding in group discussion .",
    "the preference diagram is a kind of undirected graph consisting of nodes and undirected links drawn on a plane .",
    "a node represents either the @xmath0-th subject @xmath1 or the @xmath2-th artwork @xmath3 .",
    "a link represents either the resemblance relationship between two artworks or the preference relationship of a subject to an artwork .",
    "the topology defined by the presence of links is relevant .",
    "the position of the nodes and the distance between the nodes on the diagram , however , are not relevant . figure [ rvvup4 ] [ a ] shows an example .",
    "the preference diagram is designed so that the cluster structures are clearly visible . for an individual subject @xmath1 ,",
    "four characteristic objects are selected as attributes describing the subject s preferences .",
    "the objects are the primary cluster @xmath4 , the gateway artwork in the primary cluster @xmath5 , the secondary cluster @xmath6 , and the gateway artwork in the secondary cluster @xmath7 .",
    "the primary cluster represents the cluster whose artworks are preferred by a subject most strongly .",
    "the secondary cluster is the cluster whose artworks are preferred most weakly .",
    "the gateway artwork indicates a subject s preferable entrance point to the cluster .",
    "note that the primary cluster for a subject can be the secondary cluster for another subject .",
    "the labels for the characteristic objects are not drawn on the diagram",
    ". there may be multiple gateway artworks .",
    "the preference diagram includes another interesting object .",
    "a switch object @xmath8 for a subject @xmath1 is inserted into the space between the primary and secondary clusters .",
    "the switch is assumed to change the mode of the subject s preference .",
    "the switch tends to point to the primary cluster most of the time , although it sometimes points to the secondary cluster .",
    "the switching occurs either from internal caprice or from an external stimulus such as atmosphere , influence from friends , or social interaction .",
    "the switch indicates the presence of an unknown factor that prompts the subjects to turn their interests toward something unfamiliar .",
    "this is the clue to unconscious preferences .",
    "figure [ rvvup4 ] [ b ] shows an example of the four characteristic objects and the switch object for a subject person @xmath9 .      a visualization algorithm to generate a preference diagram from the information about a subject s stated preference is presented .",

    "for this paper , we developed a method that helps people become aware of their unconscious preferences and convey them to others in the form of verbal explanation .",
    "the method combines the concepts of reflection , visualization ( with an algorithm to draw the subjects stated preferences in a diagram ) , and verbalization ( through group discussion ) .",
    "the method was tested in an experiment where the unconscious preferences of the subjects for various artworks were investigated .    in the experiment , two lessons were learned .",
    "the first is that it helps the subjects become aware of their unconscious preferences to verbalize weak preferences as compared with strong preferences through discussion over preference diagrams .",
    "the second is that it is effective to introduce an adjustable factor into visualization , such as the granularity of the preference diagram , to adapt to the differences in the subjects and to foster their mutual understanding .",
    "the lessons imply that the interpretation of the weak preferences , which emerged in the reflection process , is subject to the particular nature of the presented artworks and the subjects joining the discussion .",
    "the questionnaire may also affect the subjects . which artwork is suitable for your room ?",
    "which artwork would you like to buy ?",
    "these two questions may cause different responses from the subjects .",
    "preferences may also be influenced by a change in the environment .",
    "the individual s unconscious tendency itself may change by the individual becoming aware of its presence . such sensitivity is essential to modern consumer behavior .",
    "it is beneficial to focus on such case - by - case preferences rather than to make an effort to figure out the universal laws of human behavior .",
    "unconscious preference is one of the factors in stimulating brand switching in marketing or extending belonging groups in communication .",
    "we have taken the first step toward understanding individuals unconscious tendencies in thinking and acting .",
    "our method stimulates the existing unconscious tendency in order to prompt change .",
    "the method , which exploits the delicate nature of the unconscious preference , is essential in the future of marketing , education , communication , and many other applications .",
