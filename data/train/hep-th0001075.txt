    "the skyrme model has long been of interest as an effective field theory of nucleons @xcite .",
    "the 2 dimensional baby skyrme model allows us to study a more tractable analogue of the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the related o(3 ) sigma model is applicable to some condensed matter systems .",
    "nematic liquid crystals are a condensed matter system where the target space is not @xmath1 but @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we describe our work on the variants of the baby skyrme model and o(3 ) sigma model using @xmath0 as a target space .",
    "the o(3 ) sigma model describes maps from @xmath2 ( the `` physical '' space ) to @xmath1 ( the `` target '' space ) .",
    "@xmath2 is the normal euclidean plane , whereas @xmath1 is the 2 dimensional surface of a unit sphere embedded in 3 euclidean dimensions .",
    "the lagragian of the o(3 ) sigma model is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "the condition that @xmath6 as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is spatial radius , is usually imposed to keep the action finite .",
    "this effectively compactifies the physical space from @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "this in turn implies that the configurations @xmath9 must fall into disjoint classes characterised by the elements of the second homotopy group @xmath10 .",
    "field configurations which fall into any of the classes corresponding to non - trivial elements of @xmath11 describe ` lumps ' of energy .",
    "these lumps are not stable , and as a result are not true solitons .",
    "this instability is due to the conformal invariance of the model ",
    "the lumps have no intrinsic scale , and so may change scale without any energetic penalty .",
    "this scale invariance may be removed by the addition of new terms to the lagrangian , as seen below .",
    "the first model we examined was the baby skyrme model with the so called ` new ' potential term .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are real positive constants .",
    "the term containing @xmath13 is the so called ( 2 dimensional ) skyrme term .",
    "this term tends to cause solitons to broaden , and is the only possible lorentz covariant term of fourth order with only first order time derivatives .",
    "the term containing @xmath14 is normally refered to as the potential term .",
    "this term is chosen so that it acts to shrink the size of the soliton .",
    "consequently a stable equilibrium may be reached where the effects of the skyrme term and potential term balance .",
    "a number of different potential terms have been studied @xcite , but our @xmath0 target space forces us to use a potential term which is invariant under the transformation @xmath15 . a good choice would be the so called ` new ' potential @xmath16        @xmath0 may be thought of as a hemisphere , and so may be parameterised by a unit 3-vector @xmath9 where @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath0 may also be described locally by a 2-vector @xmath18 where @xmath19 here @xmath20 labels which chart is being used , and @xmath21 labels the components of @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath18 appears to have 3 components in this definition but , as the component @xmath22 is always 1 , @xmath18 has only 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "the chart labeled @xmath20 is ill defined on the equator @xmath23 , and so all three charts are required to cover @xmath0  the first covers all of the manifold except for an equator , the second all of this equator except for 2 antipodal points and the third those two points .",
    "a neat way to combine all three @xmath18 charts is to use the matrix @xmath24 .",
    "each chart is easily extracted as @xmath25 with no sum implied by repeated indices .",
    "the @xmath26th homotopy group of @xmath0 can be found quickly for @xmath27 as @xmath1 is a universal covering space of @xmath0 . a theorem found in @xcite states that this implies that @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 may be found to be the second symmetric group , @xmath30 . to summarise : @xmath31      the class of field configuration @xmath9 may be characterised by the degree of map , or winding number .",
    "to calculate the winding number we must calculate the pullback of the two form on the target space ; the map @xmath9 from the physical space to the target space induces a natural map ( the `` pullback '' ) from the two form on the target space to a two form on the physical space .",
    "if the two form on the physical space is then integrated over all space the result must be a multiple of an integer . by renormalising",
    "we get a formula for the integer valued winding number : @xmath32 it should be noted that the transformation @xmath33 leads to @xmath34 .",
    "this is because @xmath0 is a non - orientable manifold  a two form is not well defined on @xmath0 as its sense is changed by a translation along a non - trivial loop .",
    "in fact it may be shown @xcite that field configurations of @xmath9 are characterised not by @xmath35 but by @xmath36 . in the case of an @xmath0 target space this means that field configurations are characterised by @xmath37 .",
    "the models outlined above are highly nonlinear and more or less completely intractable analytically .",
    "the models are , however , open to study using numerical techniques .",
    "one may write a simulation on a discrete grid and analyse the evolution of an arbitrary initial state . with a clever ansatz for the initial conditions , with or without the use of a relaxation routine , the behaviour of minimal enery field configurations may be studied .",
    "we simulated the sigma and skyrme models numerically , using @xmath0 as the target space .",
    "our simulations were based on a 200 @xmath38 200 point grid using the nine point laplacian and derivatives outlined in @xcite , together with a fourth order runge - kutta algorithm for simulating time evolution .",
    "the timestep length was set to half the gridpoint spacing . to give the @xmath0 topology",
    "the state vector was stored using the @xmath39 matrix described in section ( [ geom ] ) for position on the target space , and @xmath40 for the rate of change of position on the target space with time , where a dot is used to denote derivatives with respect to time .",
    "the simulation then evaluated derivatives by determining the field as the equivalent @xmath9 for any given set of nine points , with the central point mapped to the north pole of @xmath1 .",
    "reflections from the boundaries of the grid were reduced by damping out kinetic energy in a region near the boundary .",
    "the fields were kept on manifold by applying the following transformations each timestep : @xmath41 these transformations ensure that @xmath42 ( i.e. the field lies on @xmath0 ) and that @xmath43 ( i.e. the rate of change of the field is tangential to the surface of the field manifold ) .",
    "simulations of this model were in close qualitative and quantitative agreement with simulations using an @xmath1 target space .",
    "as in the @xmath1 model the simplest ansatz for a skyrmion is the radially symmetric ansatz , usually refered to as the ` hedgehog ' ansatz @xcite . for a skyrmion of topological charge one this ansatz gives : @xmath44\\cos(\\theta - \\gamma )   \\\\ \\sin[f(r)]\\sin(\\theta - \\gamma ) \\\\",
    "\\cos[f(r ) ] \\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath45 is known as the profile function and @xmath46 is an arbitrary phase parameter .",
    "this profile function is arbitrary up to the boundary condition that @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 . to minimise the energy of the ansatz",
    "one may determine the energy of the field as a functional of the profile function and its first derivative , as shown below : @xmath50 one may then use the calculus of variations to extremise this energy with the appropriate limits at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting euler - lagrange equation is a non linear second order ode for the profile function .",
    "we solved this numerically , using the shooting method .",
    "this ansatz leads to a stable single skyrmion .",
    "note that our ansatz is identical to that of the @xmath1 skyrmion , and so our result agrees with the result of weidig @xcite .",
    "simulations showed this ansatz to be stable , again in agreement with weidig .",
    "note that the energy has been defined such that the energy of a hedgehog ansatz soliton with @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 .",
    "as for the @xmath1 model , a two skyrmion ansatz may be arrived at by taking the stereographic projection from the north pole of a one skyrmion : @xmath55 this may then be combined with another skyrmion using the ansatz @xmath56 so that the final field @xmath57 is approximately equal to the field for any skyrmion near that skyrmion ( where @xmath58 ) and the final field takes the vacuum value of @xmath59 at spatial infinity . using this ansatz",
    "we were able to reproduce the attractive and repulsive channels found in @xcite , as well as the ninety degree scattering found in the attractive channel .",
    "in fact the two models are exactly equivalent as may be seen from the following argument .",
    "consider maps @xmath60 , @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath64     to @xmath65 to @xmath66    as @xmath67 may always be smoothly deformed to map all of @xmath68 to a point .",
    "this implies that , for all smooth maps @xmath61 , all @xmath26-loops in @xmath69 shall be the pre - image of an @xmath26-loop in @xmath70 corresponding to the identity element of @xmath71 .",
    "one consequence of this is that for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , all maps @xmath61 may be described as maps to @xmath75 , as @xmath0 is universally covered by @xmath1 , so the @xmath0 new baby skyrme model is identical to the @xmath1 baby skyrme model if @xmath76 is well defined at all points .",
    "it is also worthy of note that this argument suggests that simulations of fadeev - hopf solitons @xcite using @xmath0 as a target space should reproduce the simulation of such solitons with an @xmath1 target space unless defects are present .",
    "the implication of the argument put forward above is that to discover new behaviour in an @xmath0 model we must introduce a discontinuity into the field .",
    "for such a point to be stable a circle around the discontinuity in physical space must map to a non - trivial loop in the target space .",
    "if this is not the case then the discontinuity can be removed by a continuous variation in the field .",
    "these ( point ) discontinuities are analogous to disclination lines in a liquid crystal",
    ". we shall refer to them as `` defects '' .",
    "one consequence of having an odd number of defects in the system is that a contour around the edge of the physical space must map to a non - trivial loop on @xmath0 .",
    "this means that it is no longer possible to have the field tend to a single value at spatial infinity . as a result , it is no longer easy to use a conventional potential term such as ( [ newpot ] ) in the lagrangian .",
    "we may use the @xmath0 sigma model , so our model has neither skyrme nor a potential terms , or we may use an unconventional potential term .",
    "one possible potential term would be of the form @xmath77 which we shall call the `` easy plane '' potential .",
    "this effectively gives a mass to one of the fields ( @xmath78 ) where the potential ( [ newpot ] ) gives mass to both fields orthogonal to @xmath79 .",
    "easy plane baby skyrmions have not previously been studied and so are worthy of attention in their own right .",
    "we have confined our work to the sigma model in all that follows .",
    "it should be noted that if there is no single value for the field at infinity we are no longer compactifying the physical space to @xmath1 . as a result winding number is no longer necessarily conserved .",
    "in fact , the physical space is topologically @xmath80 as not only is the space not compactified at infinity , it also has no well defined map at the point of the defect .",
    "whilst the mapping from the target space is frozen at infinity , it is not frozen around the defect . the circle around the defect necessarily maps to a non - trivial curve in @xmath0 .",
    "if we represent @xmath0 as a sphere , where antipodal identification is allowed , a non - trivial curve is a line between a pair of ( arbitrary ) poles .",
    "if we have a defect - soliton system , one of these curves represents both the image of a circle at infinity in the physical space , and the image of an infinitesimal circle around the defect . as a circle",
    "is contracted in from infinity to the defect , the image curve rotates around the sphere , hinged on the polar identification , wrapping the sphere once .",
    "as the image of the infinitesimal circle around the defect is able to move , it may rotate around the identified poles , unwinding the soliton like object .",
    "we decided to study the behaviour of a soliton like lump in the presence of a point defect . to do this",
    "we need an ansatz for a soliton - defect system to use as an initial conditon for our simulation .",
    "such an ansatz needs to be sufficiently close to equilibrium to avoid large quantities of radiation perturbing the system  if the system is far from equilibrium much of the excess energy will be shed from the solitonic objects as radiation .",
    "the most obvious ansatz for a defect is a radially symmetric , planar field .",
    "a defect at @xmath81 may be written in polar coordinates as @xmath82 which , using the stereographic projection from the south pole , @xmath83 is given by : @xmath84 this ansatz is defined for @xmath85 . on the line",
    "@xmath86 there appears , at a first glance , to be a discontinuity in the field , but as @xmath76 is identified with @xmath87 there is no such discontinuity .",
    "in fact any field configuration which contains a defect must have a line from the defect to infinity along which the identification between @xmath9 and @xmath88 is made .",
    "it is simple to show analytically that the above field configuration is in equilibrium .",
    "simulations also show that this field configuration is stable .",
    "it should be noted that this field configuration has an infinite action arising from a logarithmic divergence as @xmath8 tends to infinity or as @xmath8 tends to zero .",
    "this is not a problem if the physical system we are modeling is a liquid crystal .",
    "this is because such a system is , firstly , finite in extent , and , secondly , a discrete system .",
    "the field approximation is clearly not appropriate at @xmath51 .",
    "care must be taken when simulating such an object numerically to place such an object away from a grid point .",
    "one ansatz for a defect - soliton system which we tried early on involved ` glueing ' together three regions in an attempt to graft together a known ansatz for the soliton to a defect like object  see figure ( [ regions ] ) .",
    "in region i the field followed the standard lump ansatz for the o(3 ) sigma model .",
    "this is given by the hedgehog ansatz ( [ hedge ] ) with the profile function given by : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an arbitrary ( real ) parameter describing the ( inverse ) ` width ' of the lump .",
    "in region ii the field is constant and equal to the vacuum value of region i  there should be little discrepancy at the border between regions i and ii as a result , and any variation may be interpolated across several grid points in the simulation . in the region",
    "iii the field is given by : @xmath91 for @xmath92 . the region ii and region iii fields match along the line @xmath93 and , due to the identification @xmath94 , along the line @xmath95 .",
    "this places a defect at the origin .",
    "unfortunately this defect is far from stable  the energy of this defect is double that of the defect described by ( [ defans ] ) .",
    "thus in the simulations of this total field configuration we have seen the emission of waves of radiation by the defect .",
    "these waves affected the skyrmion . to reduce these problems",
    "we have modified our ansatz as detailed below .",
    "we modified the above ansatz by replacing the field in regions ii and iii by the field below : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and w is the stereographic projection from the south pole .",
    "at a first glance this field looks as though it might tend to the vacuum value in all directions whilst looking like a defect at small radii .",
    "in fact , this is not the case  the field is smooth away from the origin , and therefore a loop around this field at infinity must be non - trivial . the field must vary dramatically as @xmath98 approaches @xmath99 and @xmath8 approaches infinity .",
    "we had hoped that this would not be a problem in the ( finite ) region of the simulation , but discretisation brought its own problems , as shown in figure ( [ glued ] ) .",
    "the line where @xmath100 must cross the last line of grid points on the large @xmath101 side of the @xmath102 line .",
    "this leads to a point where the variation in the field from one grid point to the next is as large as it can be , resulting in a region of high energy density .",
    "in fact this region also has defect type winding number  the ansatz has created a second defect in a far from equilibrium configuration .",
    "in fact if one constructs an ansatz which tends to constant field at spatial infinity ( or the edge of the simulation region ) then the space must contain an even number of defects .",
    "a loop at large r which maps to one point in @xmath0 must correspond to the trivial element of @xmath103 , so the number of defects inside this loop must be even .",
    "to create an ansatz for a field configuration including both a soliton and a defect we must re - express our field configurations using the stereographic map , @xmath104 . a projection from the south pole causes the north pole , @xmath105 , to map to @xmath58 and the south pole to map to @xmath59 .",
    "note that the antipodal identification under this map is given by @xmath106 our ansatz must a ) look like a soliton near the soliton , b ) look like a defect near the defect , c ) look like a defect at infinity and d ) be smooth at all points away from the defect .",
    "a single soliton at the origin may be described by the field @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath46 is an arbitrary ( real ) phase parameter , @xmath90 is an arbitrary ( real ) parameter characterising the width of the soliton , and @xmath110 are polar coordinates .",
    "note that this is the hedgehog ansatz with the profile function given by ( [ lump ] ) . to combine this with a defect we choose the point of projection of both fields such that the soliton at infinity maps to a number of modulus @xmath111 , and the line along which the defect field identifies approaches @xmath112 from one side and @xmath113 from the other .",
    "these fields are given below .",
    "@xmath114 @xmath115 if we multiply these fields we find @xmath116 where @xmath101 is the polar angle coordinate with respect to the position of the defect and @xmath117 are the polar coordinates with respect to the position of the soliton .",
    "this ansatz obeys conditions c ) and d ) above .",
    "c ) is satisfied as at infinity @xmath118 .",
    "this is acceptable as multiplying a field configuration by a number of unit modulus is merely a rotation about the axis of projection .",
    "d ) is also satisfied as the line of identification in @xmath119 is preserved by the multiplication ",
    "@xmath120 and ( crudely speaking ) @xmath121 .",
    "condition a ) is fulfilled if the soliton and defect are sufficiently separated for the variation in @xmath119 to be small across the scale of the soliton .",
    "condition b ) , however , is only fulfulled if @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "an alternative ansatz involves using the inhomogeneous coordinates outlined in section ( [ geomtop ] ) .",
    "if we define a complex number @xmath124 then we can express the soliton field as a complex number which tends to @xmath112 at @xmath8 tends to @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "if we add this to the defect field then the result must satisfy conditions c ) and d ) outlined in section ( [ stanz ] ) .",
    "c ) is satisfied because the map used is a map of @xmath0 , not @xmath1 and so needs no line of identification for the defect ansatz , whilst d ) is obeyed as the soliton field vanishes at infinity , leaving only the defect field .",
    "explicitly , the fields look like this : @xmath125 this expression obeys a ) if @xmath126 is small around the position of the soliton . condition b ) is only met if @xmath127 is small in the region of the defect , and in the example above condition b ) is less well satisfied if @xmath127 has an imaginary component at the defect .      for simulations of a defect - soliton system we introduced a conformal grid in a similar manner to leese et al in @xcite .",
    "this involved changing the physical coordinates @xmath128 to @xmath129 such that @xmath130 this allows a much larger area to be simulated .",
    "the grid was @xmath131 points with @xmath132 .",
    "this conformal grid was introduced to reduce boundary effects .",
    "again , the timestep length was set to half the gridpoint spacing .",
    "another alteration to the simulation for defect - soliton systems was the introduction of a period of relaxation before the simulation was allowed to run freely .",
    "@xmath133 was set to zero throughout the grid every @xmath134 timesteps for the first @xmath135 timesteps to take the simulation as close as possible to its minimal energy before the simulation proper began .",
    "the soliton - defect system displayed certain generic characteristics  a `` spreading '' channel and a `` spiking '' channel according to the phase of the soliton . in the spreading channel",
    "the soliton would become broader and broader until it significantly overlapped the defect , at which point it would unwind , and the energy would be released to infinity as radiation . in the spiking channel",
    "the soliton would become more and more localised until the variation in the field became numerically untenable .",
    "the defect would remain stationary in all simulations , whilst the soliton would move only a very small distance , to the extent that variations in the width of the soliton would be far more significant than any movement of the maxima of the soliton .",
    "we used the stereographic ansatz ( equation([wansa ] ) ) as our initial condition with @xmath136 , and the initial soliton position relative to the defect at @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "we shall discuss the results of simulations with @xmath46 set to @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath112 and @xmath141 .",
    "after the initial period of relaxation energy was conserved to better than @xmath142 in all of these simulations .",
    "the period of relaxation ended at @xmath143 , after which the simulation ran freely until @xmath144 , unless the simulation became untenable due to soliton spiking .",
    "when the simulation was run with the phase initially set to @xmath145 the soliton became narrower with time as described above ( see figure ( [ spike ] ) ) .",
    "this resulted in the simulation ending at @xmath146 .",
    "when @xmath147 the soliton spread out and eventually unwound as described above ( see figure ( [ spread ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath148 was simulated the soliton was still subject to spreading and unwinding  the spreading channel is wider than the spiking channel .    for @xmath149 the soliton began to spike , but after a period of time the the rate of spiking slowed and the soliton began to spread , with the soliton eventually unwinding ( see figure([spir ] ) ) .",
    "this also suggests that the spiking channel is unstable .",
    "table ( [ penerg ] ) shows the energies of various simulations with initial conditions given by this ansatz .",
    "note that these energies depend heavily on the lattice spacing at the defect , and are therefore only of value when comparing the different channels .",

    "we substituted one of our ansatze into the lagrangian density , integrated over the spatial variables to find a true lagrangian and then considered one or more of the ansatz parameters as dynamic variables , so for example lagrangian ( [ siglag ] ) together with @xmath150 implies that @xmath151 which may then be integrated over to give @xmath152 allowing us to construct an equation of motion for @xmath90 .",
    "this effectively constrains the solutions of the field theory to the submanifold defined by the ansatz  in the example above our solutions are constrained to a 2 dimensional submanifold of the infinite dimensional phase space of @xmath153 .",
    "this does not allow for soliton unwinding or the release of radiation with our ansatze , as the ansatze never have radiation and always have a soliton .",
    "if we take the ansatz ( [ wansa ] ) together with the lagrangian ( [ siglag ] ) expressed in terms of stereographic coordinates @xmath154 we may construct the lagrangian density in terms of position and a few parameters .",
    "if we take the initial soliton and defect position outlined in section ( [ steans ] ) then @xmath104 becomes @xmath155 where ( @xmath156 ) are polar coordinates , @xmath90 parameterises the ( inverse ) width of the soliton and @xmath46 is the phase of the soliton .",
    "note that the soliton has position ( @xmath157 , @xmath158 ) and the defect is at the origin in this coordinate system .",
    "taking spatial derivatives of @xmath104 is then a straight forward if somewhat tedious process .",
    "time derivatives may be found by treating one or more of the parameters as dynamic - if we consider @xmath90 to be dynamic and the other parameters to be static the @xmath159 .",
    "this substitution of an ansatz and use of parameters as dynamic variables is equivalent to assuming that the field configuration moves quasi - statically from one configuration to another with different values of the dynamic variables .",
    "this assumption is valid only if our ansatz is close to equilibrium and our dynamic parameter only varies slowly with time ( i.e. in this case @xmath160 is small ) .",
    "using this approximation our lagrangian density becomes @xmath161 so our approximate lagrangian with a time dependant @xmath90 becomes @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 the euler - lagrange equation then gives us @xmath165    we considered the example above , where all variables are static except for @xmath90 , but found an analytic integration to be intractable .",
    "we carried out the integration and time evolution numerically , using a fourth order runge - kutta algorithm for the time evolution .",
    "we also carried out a similar analysis using the inhomogeneous ansatz ( [ inhom ] ) .    in figures ( [ geodesstere ] , [ geodesinhom ] )",
    "we show the results of this treatment against those of the full simulation .",
    "the two treatments produce broadly similar results , although the rapidity of the broadening and spiking is faster in the full simulation .",
    "this is not entirely unreasonable considering that we have moved from around 160,000 degrees of freedom to 2 !",
