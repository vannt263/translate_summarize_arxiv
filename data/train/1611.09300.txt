    "<S> it has been studied extensively under various assumptions on the market , including completeness . </S>",
    "<S> the assumptions on the market and price processes in this paper are the same as those made in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find a closed - form formula for a portfolio under which the expected utility is close to optimal when the time horizon is small . as in @xcite , we work with the problem of portfolio optimization via its associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation . specifically , we work with the  marginal hjb equation \" given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find a classical sub- and super - solution to the marginal hjb equation . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison principle argument for a logarithmic transformation of the marginal hjb equation then yields the result . </S>"
