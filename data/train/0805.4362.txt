    "the grosse - wulkenhaar model ( gwm ) has been shown renormalizable at all orders of perturbations @xcite .",

    "its most remarkable property , which holds both for the real and complex version , is asymptotic safeness .",
    "the @xmath0-function vanishes at all order of perturbations .",
    "this result has been proved in @xcite by a careful combination of dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) and ward identities ( wi s ) . aside from @xmath11",
    "supersymmetric non abelian gauge theory , it is the only yet known four dimensional quantum field theory with this property .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether there exist other nc renormalizable models with this striking property .",
    "the gross - neveu model @xcite and the @xmath12 and @xmath13 invariant gwm s @xcite , when preserving langmann - szabo ( ls ) duality @xcite , have been also proved renormalizable .",
    "however the gross - neveu model is not asymptotically safe @xcite , and in the class of nc color models considered in @xcite , only the gwm itself ( real or complex ) is asymptotically safe .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the complex gwm with added magnetic field , namely the langmann - szabo - zarembo ( lsz ) model @xcite .",
    "langmann and co - workers proposed that small perturbations of this theory could produce solvable models with renormalizable interactions . here , we study the rg flow of the coupling constant , still with @xmath14 and a magnetic field satisfying @xmath15 . we prove that this model is still asymptotically safe at all orders , and we calculate the rg flows of the two corresponding wave function constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that beyond its possible relevance for high energy physics , this lsz model is a toy version of the quantum hall effect , which can be considered a @xmath18 nc quantum field theory with non relativistic propagator including matsubara frequencies and fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section introduces the gwm in a magnetic field . the main theorem on the vanishing @xmath0-function and its proof are developed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 provides derivations of rg flows of the new parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "further issues and conclusions are drawn in section 5 , while an appendix summarizes some calculations .",
    "the following action describes the complex nc @xmath19 lsz model in the moyal - euclidean space @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnetic field , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the inverse of the antisymmetric matrix associated with the moyal @xmath24-product .",
    "the mass parameter is @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an harmonic potential .",
    "the complex gwm is recovered at @xmath27 .",
    "we use the matrix basis and the notations of refs.@xcite , setting @xmath14 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the flow of @xmath28 goes rapidly to @xmath29 in the uv limit .",
    "after rescaling the field and the coupling constant by two constants , the generating functional becomes @xmath30 where traces are implicit , @xmath31 is the action and @xmath32 represents external sources .",
    "the quadratic part of the action is now expressed in term of the left and right matrix operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 with unequal weights @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and the new mass parameter is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the theory is stable for @xmath36 . by convention",
    ", we consider @xmath21 positive , hence @xmath37 .",
    "note that the model ( [ action ] ) can be seen as a @xmath38-deformed matrix theory with dual parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the gwm is recovered as @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "although this deformation is not in the ordinary sense of chakrabarti and co - workers @xcite , the model renormalizability suggests that the deformed quantum algebras which are encountered in quantum group theory and quantum mechanics combined with nonlocal geometries may also be renormalizable .",
    "this is encouraging for the @xmath16-bosons studies and related theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the bare propagator in the matrix base , at @xmath14 , is @xmath44 and we use notations @xmath45    feynman rules involve only orientable graphs with propagators oriented from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "arrows occur in alternating cyclic order at every vertex . for a field @xmath48",

    "right index_. consequently for the field @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a _",
    "right index _ and @xmath53 a _ left index_.    in @xcite , the renormalizability of the model has been proved in the direct space at all order of perturbation .",
    "the renormalization of the four point function is essentially the same as the one of the real gwm .",
    "but the two point function renormalization is more subtle due to the left / right asymmetry of the model .",
    "we denote by @xmath54 the amputated one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) four point function with external indices @xmath55 , and @xmath56 the amputated 1pi two point function with external indices @xmath57 ( the self - energy ) . to define the wave function renormalization",
    ", we have to distinguish the left and right side of the ribbon and to attribute to each side its renormalization through the definitions @xmath58 which are the derivative of the self - energy with respect to left and right indices .",
    "the wave function renormalization is then @xmath59 corresponding to a field rescaling @xmath60 .",
    "therefore the effective coupling is defined as @xmath61    [ theo ] the equation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the bare constant , holds up to irrelevant terms to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "irrelevant terms have to be understood with respect to power counting and include in particular all contributions of non - planar or planar graphs with more than one broken face .",
