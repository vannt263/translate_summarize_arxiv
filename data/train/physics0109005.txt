    "it is known that two gas bubbles pulsating in an acoustic field undergo an interaction force called the secondary bjerknes force @xcite .",
    "this force is attractive when the bubbles pulsate in - phase with each other , while it is repulsive otherwise ; that is , the phase property of the bubbles plays an important role in determining the sign of the force . in a seminal paper published in 1984 @xcite , zabolotskaya , using a linear coupled oscillator model , showed theoretically that in a certain case , the sign of the force may change as the bubbles come closer to one another .",
    "this theoretical prediction was ensured by recent experiments that captured the stable , periodic translational motion of two coupled bubbles @xcite , resulting from the sign reversal of the force at a certain distance between the bubbles .",
    "zabolotskaya assumed that this sign reversal is due to variation in the natural frequencies of the interacting bubbles , which results in shifts of their pulsation phases .",
    "the theoretical formula zabolotskaya derived to evaluate the natural frequencies of two interacting bubbles , which corresponds to one given previously by shima @xcite , is represented as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the equilibrium radii of the bubbles , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are their partial natural ( angular ) frequencies , @xmath5 is the angular frequency of an external sound , and @xmath6 is the distance between the centers of the bubbles .",
    "this equation predicts the existence of two natural frequencies per bubble , and is symmetric ; namely , it exchanges 10 and 20 in the subscripts of the variables to reproduce the same equation , meaning that the two bubbles have the same natural frequencies .    during the last decade , a number of studies regarding the sign reversal of the force have been performed @xcite . among them , refs .",
    "@xcite also considered the relevance of the change in the natural frequencies ( or resonance frequencies @xcite ) to the sign reversal . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus our attention on this case , although it has been shown that other factors , such as the nonlinearity in bubble pulsation @xcite and the higher - order terms appearing in the time - averaged interaction force @xcite which has been neglected in previous works , can also cause the sign reversal .    in 1995 ,",
    "doinikov and zavtrak @xcite , using a linear mathematical model in which the multiple scattering of sound between bubbles is taken into account more rigorously , predicted again the sign reversal .",
    "they also asserted that this reversal is due to the change in the natural frequencies .",
    "they assumed that the natural frequencies of both bubbles increase as the bubbles approach each other , resulting sometimes in the sign reversal .",
    "when , for example , both bubbles are larger than the resonance size ( i.e. , the case of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and the distance between them is large enough , they pulsate in - phase with each other .",
    "as the bubbles approach each other , the natural frequency of a smaller bubble may first , at a certain distance , rise above the driving frequency , and in turn the bubbles pulsations become antiphase ; the force then changes from attractive to repulsive .",
    "when , on the other hand , one bubble is larger and the other is smaller than the resonance size ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) and the distance between them is large , they pulsate out - of - phase with each other and the force is repulsive . as the distance between the bubbles becomes smaller , the natural frequencies of both bubbles may rise , and when the natural frequency of a larger bubble rises above the driving frequency , the repulsive force may turn into attraction .",
    "this interpretation is supported even in more recent papers @xcite .",
    "although this interpretation seems to explain the sign reversal well , it is opposed to the prediction given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) which reveals that the higher natural frequency ( converging to the partial natural frequency of a smaller bubble for @xmath10 @xcite ) increases but the lower one ( converging to the partial natural frequency of a larger bubble for @xmath10 ) decreases as the bubbles approach each other .    in 2001 , harkin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed an extensive theoretical study concerning the translational motion of two acoustically coupled gas bubbles in a weak and a moderate driving sound field .",

    "their explanation based on a formula given directly by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is essentially the same as those by zabolotskaya @xcite and by doinikov & zavtrak @xcite .",
    "the authors should note here that all the previous theoretical models mentioned above can _ describe _ ( or _ explain _ ) the sign reversal .",
    "however , the _ interpretation _ we will provide in the present paper is different from the previous ones .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an alternative interpretation of the sign reversal , one that may be more accurate than the previous ones that are based on the natural - frequency analysis .",
    "recently , having reexamined the linear coupled oscillator model used frequently to analyze the dynamics of acoustically coupled bubbles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , we found that a bubble interacting with a neighboring bubble has three `` transition frequencies '' , defined as _",
    "the driving frequencies for which the phase difference between an external sound and the bubble s pulsation becomes _ @xmath12 _ ( or _ @xmath13 _ _ ) _ _ , two of which correspond to the natural frequencies @xcite . among the three transition frequencies , the lowest one decreases and the remaining two increase as the bubbles approach each other . meanwhile , for @xmath14 only one of them converges to the partial natural frequency of the corresponding bubble .",
    "namely , the transition frequencies defined as above are asymmetric .",
    "the use of the transition frequencies would allow us an accurate understanding of the sign reversal , because observing these frequencies provides more detailed insights of the bubbles phase properties rather than that provided by the natural - frequency analysis .",
    "using the theory for the transition frequencies , we arrive at a novel interpretation of the sign reversal .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the previously expounded theories regarding the natural frequencies , the transition frequencies , and the secondary bjerknes force .",
    "let us consider the linear volume oscillation of @xmath15bubble system immersed in an incompressible liquid .",
    "suppose that the time - dependent radius of bubble @xmath16 , @xmath17 , can be represented as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the equilibrium radius and the deviation of the radius , respectively , and @xmath22 .",
    "the radius deviation can be determined by solving the linear oscillator model ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the driving pressure is represented by the sum of @xmath31 and the sound pressure scattered by the surrounding bubbles , @xmath32 , as @xmath33 the value of @xmath34 is determined by integrating the momentum equation for linear sound waves , @xmath35 , coupled with the divergence - free condition , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the radial coordinate measured from the center of a bubble and @xmath38 is the velocity along @xmath37 .",
    "resultantly , the driving pressure is determined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the distance between the centers of bubbles @xmath16 and @xmath41 .    in a single - bubble case ( i.e. , for @xmath42 ) ,",

    "namely , @xmath62 as mentioned already , this equation predicts the existence of up to two natural frequencies in a double - bubble system .",
    "the transition frequencies of bubble 1 are determined so that @xmath63 becomes @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) . because @xmath66 @xcite , the resulting formula for deriving the transition frequencies of bubble 1 is @xmath67 assuming @xmath60 and @xmath61 reduces this to @xmath68 as was proven in ref .",
    "@xcite , this equation predicts the existence of up to three transition frequencies per bubble .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in the same article , the terms in the second @xmath69 of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) are the same as those on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "these results mean that in a double - bubble case the phase reversal of a bubble s pulsation can take place not only at its natural frequencies but also at one other frequency . because @xmath70 , eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ( and also eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) ) is asymmetric , meaning that the bubbles have different transition frequencies .",
    "a preliminary discussion for a @xmath15bubble system @xcite showed that a bubble in the system has up to @xmath71 transition frequencies , @xmath15 ones of which correspond to the natural frequency .",
    "namely , a bubble has an odd number of transition frequencies .",
    "this result can be understood as follows : even in a multibubble case , a bubble s pulsation may be in - phase or out - of - phase with a driving sound @xcite when the driving frequency is much lower or much higher , respectively , than its natural frequencies ; thus , in order to interpolate these two extremes consistently an odd number of phase reversals are necessary @xcite .",
    "the secondary bjerknes force acting between the bubbles for sufficiently weak forcing is expressed with @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the volume and the position , respectively , of bubble @xmath16 , @xmath75 denotes the time average , and @xmath76 .",
    "the sign reversal of this force occurs only when the sign of @xmath77 ( or of @xmath78 ) changes , because @xmath79 and @xmath80 . if the phase shifts resulting from the radiative interaction between bubbles are neglected , this force is repulsive when @xmath81 stays between @xmath49 and @xmath82 , and is attractive otherwise @xcite . in the case where the radiative interaction is taken into consideration ,",

    "the change of @xmath122 in the later case is apparently due to the highest transition frequency of bubble 2 , which can not be obtained by the traditional natural - frequency analysis .",
