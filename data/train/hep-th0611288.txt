    "it is worth to mention that when there exists a cosmological horizon , the solution does not present black hole .",
    "this is due to the fact that the metric function @xmath55 has only one real positive root . in the case of ( @xmath101 and @xmath100 ) the spacetimes associated with the solution ( [ f ] ) exhibit a variety of possible casual structures depending on the values of the metric parameters @xmath20 , @xmath102 , @xmath70 , @xmath63 , and @xmath103 .",

    "the way that one can calculate these quantities and obtain finite values for them is through the use of the counterterm method inspired by ads / cft correspondence @xcite . although , in the presence of a nontrivial dilaton field , the spacetime may not behave as either ds ( @xmath99 ) or ads ( @xmath100 ) , one may use the counterterm method for computing the conserved quantities . since our solutions have flat boundary [ @xmath111 , there exists only one boundary counterterm @xmath112 ^{1/2}.   \\label{ict}\\ ] ]",

    "<S> in this paper , we construct a new class of charged , rotating solutions of @xmath0-dimensional einstein - born - infeld - dilaton gravity with liouville - type potentials and investigate their properties . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter . we find that these solutions can represent black brane , with inner and outer event horizons , an extreme black brane or a naked singularity provided the parameters of the solutions are chosen suitably . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute temperature , entropy , charge , electric potential , mass and angular momentum of the black brane solutions , and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the conserved quantities are independent of the born - infeld parameter @xmath1 , while they depend on the dilaton coupling constant @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the total mass of the black brane with infinite boundary as a function of the entropy , the angular momenta and the charge and perform a stability analysis by computing the heat capacity in the canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the system is thermally stable for @xmath3 independent of the values of the charge and born - infeld parameters , while for @xmath4 the system has an unstable phase . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are stable provided @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on the charge and the dimensionality of the spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> that is the solutions are unstable for highly nonlinear electromagnetic field or when the dilaton coupling constant is large . </S>"
