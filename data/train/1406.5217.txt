    "we propose a mechanical turbine - based engine to harness the contractions of soft , photo - responsive solids with a large stroke .",
    "we thus take photo - active nematic liquid crystal elastomers ( lces ) as our working material .",
    "related engines have been proposed before , for instance based on the bend response of strips of nematic photo - glasses connecting two wheels  @xcite . in contrast , we proposed a two - wheel stretch engine  @xcite using a nematic photo - lce .",
    "the engine had analogies to that of steinberg _ et .",

    "we extend the two - wheel approach of  @xcite to mechanical turbine - based engines , see fig .",

    "there is a similarity to a turbine that converted chemical to mechanical energy  @xcite .",

    ", suggests that its efficiency can be as high as @xmath0 .",
    "the basis of these two - wheel and turbine engines is that a nematic rubber strip passes respectively once around two wheels , or multiply around spindles , turning at the same rate .",
    "the strip reduces its natural length on heating or illumination during its transition around one wheel ; since its length while on the wheel is fixed , then the tension rises . on leaving the wheel , it physically contracts to its new equilibrium length and , in thereby eliminating the tension that has arisen , does work on the wheels / spindles that are turning underneath it .",
    "a net work is done because the wheels are of different diameters or the spindles are tapered .",
    "this paper is about the mechanics , work cycle and efficiency if spindles are used rather than wheels . with many passes around the spindles ,",
    "the work cycle comes to resemble that of a turbine .",
    "classical elastomers are cross - linked polymer melts exhibiting liquid characteristics locally , but are solid - like on a macroscopic scale . incorporating molecular rods into the polymers of a simple elastomer leads to networks that combine orientational liquid crystal order with the extreme stretchiness of rubber , that is lces  @xcite .",
    "the shape of a monodomain lce is very sensitive to the change of the nematic order parameter @xmath1 ; network polymers are elongated by the directional order and mechanical shape change ensues .",
    "the order decreases on increasing the temperature , which manifests as a uniaxial contraction , by a factor @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) of the elastomer along the nematic director  @xcite .",
    "the contraction is especially rapid in the vicinity of the transition temperature to the isotropic state .",
    "analogous shape changes occur in photoelastomers in which photoisomerizable dye molecules , rod - like in their _ trans _ ground state , are connected to the lce structure  @xcite . here",
    ", illumination causes the creation of bent - shaped _ cis _ isomers of the dye which act as impurities that reduce the nematic order , in turn leading to a contraction of the photoelastomer .",
    "the presence of _ cis _ isomers raises the effective temperature of the photoelastomer from @xmath4 to a pseudo @xmath5 which depends on the _ cis _ concentration and mimics the disorder as if it were induced thermally  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that mechanical deformations of elastomers are reversible , that is , on removal of heat or light , recovery elongations by a factor of @xmath6 occur .",
    "these elongations can be huge , up to 400%  @xcite .",

    "the modulus @xmath9 is temperature dependent .",
    "a simple , freely - jointed rod ( fjr ) model quite accurately describes a wide range of lces  @xcite and , in particular , the development of photoforce  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the ratios of the effective step lengths of the network polymers at the reference temperature @xmath4 and the current temperature @xmath8 , respectively parallel and perpendicular to the director . before heating or illumination ,",
    "the temperature is @xmath4 ; the extension factors @xmath7 are measured from the lengths in this initial state .",
    "the step lengths depend directly on the aspect ratio of the units of the polymer , but these cancel in the ratios @xmath16 , thus thus depend on the nematic order parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a simple way in the fjr model : = ( 1 + 2q)/(1 + 2 ) = ( 1-q)/(1-)[p - defs ] .",

    "we henceforth describe optical response , thermal response being entirely analogous . to realize a continuously operating engine , we subject the elastomer to a cyclical process through states a  b  c  d  a by changing the force and illumination .",
    "it is easy to see from fig .",

    "@xmath33 is similar in form to the work done in the various gaseous @xmath34@xmath35 cycles .",
    "we assume the moduli are comparable , @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the work @xmath33 delivered is greater than the difference established in the free energies per length of band in its unstretched state at c and b by a ( positive ) term @xmath37 that arises during the cycle due to heat absorption .",
    "one already sees from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the pre - stretch , @xmath38 , imposed before illumination , enhances work output considerably , just as a higher compression ratio improves conventional engines .",

    "thus the heat input per unit length of unstretched elastomer during the isothermal process c  d equals the work done @xmath42 .",
    "the efficiency is the ratio of the work done to the optical energy plus heat invested per cycle : = = ( 1- ) / ( 1 + ) [ eta1 ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the reduced force integrals in eq .  ( [ work1 ] ) and depend on the order along the isotherms @xmath4 and @xmath8 . from eq .",

    "since @xmath48 , the efficiency is always @xmath49 .",
    "the ratio of material constants has been estimated as @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "thus the efficiency is determined by the value of the order parameter @xmath1 and the value of the pre - stretch @xmath38 . as an example we take a modest value for the dark - state order , @xmath51 , which would yield @xmath52 , or equivalently an elongation @xmath53 on recovering the nematic state from the isotropic , illuminated state .",

    "soft , extensible photo - solids deliver large amounts of work , but their extensions and contractions lead to sliding and hence concomitant frictional losses .",
    "we analyzed such losses and calculated the fraction of work lost due to them .",
    "that our proposed photo - conversion method has moving parts gives it a disadvantage over conventional photo - voltaics , though rubber is highly durable and tough  for instance car tyres survive long use in harsh , abrasive conditions .",
    "another difficulty , that could perhaps be solved by chemical design , is degradation from the effect of uv light .",
    "the role of dynamics when attempting to attain the above efficiencies also remains a question . as we noted , the residence time in the isometric state b ",
    "c needs to be long enough that light penetrates deeply to convert the whole thickness of the band to the isotropic state . for intense beams",
    "this requires a non - linear bleaching wave ( of light - induced dye conversion ) to traverse the thickness @xcite just as that part of the band leaves the section of the spindle with maximal radius @xmath58 .",
    "longer residence simply gives time for back reaction without mechanical work being delivered .",
    "light energy is wasted and the efficiency drops from the values emerging from the above analysis . thus light intensity , band thickness , residence in the isometric state , and rotational rate are all related aspects of the dynamics and need optimisation by future studies .",
