    "one of the challenges of operating a high - energy neutrino telescope is to reject the background of cosmic ray muons traversing the detector .",
    "it is possible to use this background to do tev - energy gamma ray astronomy .",
    "showers generated by tev gamma rays from sources in the southern hemisphere can produce muons that penetrate to the depth of the icecube ( achterberg , @xmath0 2003 ) detector .",
    "although relatively few muons are produced in a gamma ray shower , we will demonstrate that a directional source of tev photons can produce a measurable excess over the background of muons produced by cosmic ray primaries at a rate of @xmath1 . by sheer statistics , a crab - like object ,",
    "the standard candle of tev astronomy , will produce a yearly excess of @xmath2-@xmath3 , depending on the high - energy characteristics of the source . at tev energies ,",
    "sources burst to fluxes as high as ten times the flux of the crab .",
    "we will show that icecube s sensitivity to tev gamma rays is comparable to milagro , although neither can match the instantaneous sensitivity of the new generation of atmospheric cerenkov telescopes .",
    "the latter , however , are only capable of observing a few degree patch of the sky on moonless , clear nights . with a south pole location ,",
    "icecube is unique in that it observes the same sky without interruption , 24 hours per day , 7 days per week .",
    "it is most sensitive to sources overhead at the south pole , a poorly studied portion of the southern sky .    while icecube is a whole - sky muon and neutrino observatory at energies in excess of @xmath4 , where the atmospheric background is negligible because of its steep energy spectrum , at tev energies , the background of down - going cosmic ray muons prevents the detection of neutrinos from southern sources . to operate as a gamma ray observatory ,",
    "all icecube must do is record the directions of the  background \" muons and form a muon sky map of the southern hemisphere .",
    "the muons will be triggered at a rate of close to 2khz and reconstructed in real time .",
    "eventually other shower properties , such as energy , could be recorded and cuts applied to identify muons of gamma ray origin in the much larger background of cosmic ray induced muons .",
    "tev gamma ray astronomy has developed in several important ways in recent years . in the 1990 s , galactic sources , such as the crab nebula , and extragalactic sources , such as markarian 421 ,",
    "were observed to produce tev photons .",
    "today , 6 sources have been detected by multiple experiments with high significance .",
    "another eight have been detected by a single experiment with high significance .",
    "while sources are few by astronomy standards , their high - energy behavior is fascinating and the accumulating data now defies a comprehensive theoretical explanation ( weekes 2003 ) . after the pioneering work of egret ( mukherjee , @xmath0 1997 and sreekumar , @xmath0 1997 ) , whipple ( petry , @xmath0 2002 ) and others , new instrumentation is being developed and deployed such as milagro ( atkins , @xmath5 2001 ) and the next generation of atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( acts ) including veritas ( ong , @xmath0 2003 ) , magic ( baixeras , @xmath5 2003 ) , hess ( hofmann , @xmath5 2002 ) , cangaroo ( kawachi _ et al .",

    "_ 2002 ) and others , as well as satellite based detectors such as glast ( kamae , @xmath0 2003 ) . for a recent review of gamma ray astronomy , see ong ( ong , 2003 ) .    presently , only the milagro experiment is capable of monitoring large portions of the sky for tev - bright transient sources that may appear , such as gamma ray bursts and blazars .",
    "milagro is , however , only capable of observing approximately a @xmath6 diameter cone of the sky at one time , leaving many prospective transient sources unobserved in the tev .",
    "icecube , now under construction , is designed to observe high - energy muons and showers generated in neutrino interactions inside of or nearby the detector volume .",
    "multi - tev showers created by photon primaries in the atmosphere will also generate muons , some of which may propagate to the depth of the detector .",
    "the number of muons with energy greater than @xmath7 produced in a shower with a photon primary of energy @xmath8 is well approximated by @xmath9 @xmath10 is the zenith angle of the shower and all energies are given in units of tev throughout this paper .",
    "this parameterization is based on the results of monte carlo and is accurate for muons with energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( halzen , stanev & yodh 1996 , halzen , hikasa & stanev 1986 ) .",
    "this parameterization describes muons from the decay of pions produced in the photoproduction of shower photons .",
    "muons from muon pair production or the decay of charm particles , which are not important at the energies of interest , have been neglected . for a complete discussion , see ( drees , halzen & hikasa 1989 ) .    for a muon to be observed , it must reach the detector with energy above the threshold of the experiment .",
    "for icecube , this threshold is @xmath13 .",
    "as they travel from the surface to the detector , muons lose energy continuously according to @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( gaisser 1991 and dutta _ et al .",
    "the muon range is then @xmath17 \\ . \\label{murange}\\ ] ] for a vertical and down - going muon to reach a depth of 1400 m with an energy of 0.1tev , the detector threshold , it must have an energy greater than @xmath18 at the surface .",
    "this threshold is higher for sources not at the zenith as the required range for such muons is increased to @xmath19 .",
    "table  [ table : one ] shows the surface threshold of muons as a function of zenith angle .",
    "the flux of a generic tev gamma ray emitter can be parameterized as @xmath20 again , @xmath8 is in units of tev .",
    "typical sources which we consider have values of @xmath21 .    to calculate the number of muons observed from a given source , we convolve eq .  [ muons ] with eq .  [ spectrum ] .",
    "the result is the number of muons with energy above the surface threshold from a source @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a correction factor , approximately given by @xmath25 eq .",
    "[ conv ] is only accurate when the integral is performed over many decades of energy . since this is not necessarily the case for us , @xmath24 has been introduced to correct for this .",
    "this parameterization agrees with explicit monte carlo results ( halzen , hikasa & stanev 1986 ) .",
    "we will use @xmath26 neglecting the small probability that lower energy gamma showers produce detected muons .    to determine if the number of muons calculated above is a significant observation , the background from cosmic ray muons must be understood .",
    "the background for icecube is predicted to be approximately given by ( achterberg , @xmath0 2003 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angular resolution of the detector . for icecube",
    ", the angular resolution is expected to be better than @xmath29 ; we will take @xmath30 as a conservative estimate .",
    "the signal to noise for a given source is then @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath28 is in degrees , @xmath33 is the observation time in seconds and @xmath34 is the effective area of the detector , @xmath35 in the case of icecube .    as a first example",
    ", we consider a hypothetical tev - bright object similar to the crab nebula , but located at the south pole zenith . with an overhead source ,",
    "the muon surface threshold is approximately 0.560 tev . for the crab",
    ", we use the values @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the signal to noise of such a source in icecube is @xmath38 for one year of observation .",
    "if the gamma ray spectrum extends to 50 tev , a 3.3-@xmath39 observation is predicted .",
    "if the spectrum extends to 150 tev , a 5-@xmath39 observation is possible .",
    "this calculation is somewhat conservative in our choice of @xmath40 . including gamma rays below this energy",
    "would enhance the significance of the source .    if a prospective source is not directly overhead , the significance of an observation is reduced . considering again the crab - like source , but with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we find a significance of @xmath43-@xmath39 . for the same source , but with @xmath44 , a 1.2-@xmath39 is expected .",
    "there are several sources which are known to be , or are likely to be , tev emitters in the southern hemisphere including the bl lac object pks 2155 - 304 , supernova 1006 , the pulsar 1706 - 44 , the radio galaxy cen - a , the supernova remnant rxj1713 - 39 , the starburst galaxy ngc 253 and the vela pulsar .",
    "there are many sources in the southern sky which have not been adequately studied at this time , in part due to the fact that the vast majority of tev gamma ray experiments have primarily operated in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the cangaroo ( kawachi _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 and okumura _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) experiment has established tev emission from a variety of sources in the southern sky at this time , but like any act , can not possibly monitor large portions of the sky . for a list of hypothetical sources and icecube s sensitivity , see table  [ table : results1 ] .",
    "in addition to continuous sources , blazars such as markarian 421 or markarian 501 have been observed to flare to luminosities significantly greater than , for example , the crab .",
    "if such an event were to occur in the southern sky , a flare of one week duration and ten times the flux of the crab , could be observed at @xmath45-@xmath39 significance by icecube .    for particularly bright sources",
    ", it may be possible for smaller area neutrino detectors such as amanda ( andres , @xmath46 , 2001 ) or antares ( aslanides , @xmath0 , 1999 ) to make such observations .",
    "although these experiments have considerably less effective area , they also have significantly lower energy thresholds . for a summary of high - energy neutrino astronomy , see ( halzen & hooper , 2002 ) or ( learned & mannheim , 2000 ) .",
    "unlike icecube , milagro is located on the surface and , therefore , has a considerably lower energy threshold .",
    "however , without the depth of an underground experiment , milagro suffers from larger backgrounds .    to establish the sensitivity of milagro to tev sources",
    ", we consider one of the sources which they have observed with high significance , the crab nebula .",
    "the gamma ray spectrum of the crab is approximately @xmath47 which corresponds to @xmath48 and @xmath37 in our parameterization .",
    "we parameterize the effective area of milagro as ( atkins , @xmath49 . , 2001 )",
    "@xmath50 the number of signal events predicted from the crab nebula in milagro is then given by @xmath51 @xmath52 \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-4 } \\",
    ", \\rm{events / sec}\\ ] ] using @xmath53 .",
    "over one year of observation , with the crab observable in the sky approximately @xmath54 of the time , we predict @xmath55 events / yr in milagro .",
    "this appears to be a slightly optimistic estimate , as milagro has actually observed an excess from the crab of approximately 3870 events / yr .    the background rate observed in milagro is approximately 2300 events / day for an object observable @xmath54 of the time .",
    "after 1 year of observation with milagro , we would expect a signal to noise from the crab of @xmath56 using the rate actually observed by milagro , 3870 events / yr for @xmath57 days , we get @xmath58 which is similar to the 6.4-@xmath39 result published by the milagro collaboration ( atkins , @xmath49 . , 2003 and atkins , @xmath49 . , 2001 )",
    ".    to emphasize the comparison with icecube , for an overhead source with @xmath59 , milagro is sensitive to objects with @xmath60 of the minimum flux required by icecube . as the zenith angle increases , this factor becomes smaller , reaching @xmath61 by @xmath44 . for a list of hypothetical sources and sensitivities for icecube and milagro ,",
    "see table  [ table : results1 ] .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) are designed to be highly sensitive to showers generated by tev gamma rays .",
    "they must be pointed a source , however , and are not capable of continuously observing large portions of the sky as experiments such as icecube or milagro can .    for comparison , consider a generic act with a threshold energy of .25 tev and effective area of @xmath62 .",
    "the number of events observed for such a telescope is given by @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath33 is the observation time in seconds .",
    "the factor of @xmath66 appears due to the definition of angular acceptance in the estimation of the experiment s effective area .",
    "if the act has , for example , a @xmath67 energy resolution and 0.001 steradians angular acceptance , the corresponding background consists largely of misidentified hadronic showers and electron - primary showers .",
    "this background can be approximated by @xmath68 \\ , a_{\\rm{eff}}\\ , t\\ ] ] @xmath69 combining these results , we get a signal to noise of @xmath70 to compare with an experiment such as icecube and milagro , consider again a hypothetical , crab - like tev - bright source with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in less than 100 seconds of observations time , a 5-@xmath39 observation could be made .",
    "similarly impressive results are expected for a variety of sources .",
    "an experiment such as icecube can not possibly compete with acts in sensitivity to known continuous sources .",
    "unlike acts , however , experiments such as icecube or milagro are capable of observing large portions of the sky and , therefore , are sensitive to transient sources such as gamma ray bursts or blazars .",
    "we will discuss such sources in the following section .",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrated that acts are far more sensitive to known continuous sources than either icecube or milagro in this section , we will discuss the prospects for icecube and milagro to observe multi - tev transient sources to which acts are not sensitive .    using the methods described in sections  [ icecube ] and  [ milagro ] , we have calculated the signal to noise expected in both experiments for a variety of hypothetical transient sources .",
    "these results ( see table  [ table : results ] ) demonstrate milagro s sensitivity to gamma ray bursts and blazars for values of @xmath73 of order @xmath74 and possibly lower , depending on the spectral characteristics and duration of the burst .",
    "icecube , while not as sensitive as milagro in this respect , is capable of monitoring much of the , unobserved , southern sky for particularly tev - bright transients .",
    "a short duration event ( @xmath75 a few seconds ) , such as a gamma ray burst could be observed with 5-@xmath39 confidence by icecube for @xmath73 as low as @xmath76 if its spectrum extends to very high energies and is located overhead . for a less ideal short duration source , only extending to tens of tev , or at @xmath77 , for example , could be observed only if @xmath78 , or so .",
    "longer duration transients , such as blazars , which typically have flares of many minutes duration , can be observed with less fluence .",
    "again , we would like to point out that no experiment other than icecube will be capable of monitoring the southern sky for tev - bright transients .",
    "we have calculated the rates and sensitivities of icecube as a tev gamma ray observatory .",
    "icecube , capable of detecting muons of @xmath13 and above , can observe the presence of muons generated in multi - tev gamma ray showers , and distinguish these events from background given a sufficiently tev - bright source .",
    "we have compared the sensitivities of icecube , in this respect , to both milagro and a generic act .",
    "acts are considerably more sensitive , but do not have the ability to monitor large portions of the sky continuously . comparisons of icecube with milagro indicate that icecube s sensitivity is comparable to milagro s for sources near the southern zenith .",
    "additionally , these experiments are complementary , as they do not observe the same portions of the sky .",
    "if a tev - bright transient source occurs in the southern hemisphere , icecube may be the only experiment capable of monitoring it .",
    "no additional hardware or software is needed in icecube beyond its planned design .",
