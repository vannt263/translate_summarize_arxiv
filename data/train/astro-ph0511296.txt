    "distribution of galaxies in the local universe is highly non - uniform as known from various redshift surveys ( e.g. cfa redshift survey ; @xcite , 2df ; @xcite , and sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on these extensive spectroscopic surveys , a map of the local universe is drawn with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "galaxies tend to be clustered by gravity and form large filamentary and clumpy structures with voids in between the filaments . at intersections of filaments , gravitationally bound concentrations of galaxies , which we call clusters of galaxies , are often seen .",
    "these filaments and galaxy concentrations are cast all over the universe forming network structures .",
    "it is of great interest to know how such large scale structures of galaxies have been built up in the history of the universe .",
    "the large - scale structures have been extensively explored even at high redshifts based on various photometric / spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys suggest that filamentary structures of galaxies seem to have appeared since an early epoch of the universe .",
    "however , it is not well known how these structures developed with time and became matured to the present - day structures .",
    "the cosmic large - scale structures inversely mean that galaxies live in various environments  some galaxies live in low density filaments and some live in dense clusters .",
    "it is now a widely accepted fact that galaxy properties such as star formation rates depend on environment that surrounds galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the origin of such strong environmental dependence of galaxy properties is not well understood . it must be closely related to the process of structure formation , but physical mechanisms that actually drive the observed environmental dependence remain unidentified . to improve the situation",
    ", we are conducting a panoramic imaging and spectroscopic surveys of distant clusters ( pisces ; @xcite ) from their cores and to the surrounding filamentary structures .",
    "during the course of this wide area survey , we have identified for the first time the environment where star formation activity drops sharply .",
    "that is `` groups of galaxies '' located in the filaments extending out from the cluster cores . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that the colour distribution of galaxies changes at relatively low projected density of galaxies that corresponds to groups of galaxies in the filaments .",
    "however , the actual physical process behind the truncation of star formation is yet unidentified . in order to further investigate what is happening in groups ,",
    "spectroscopic information is essential such as [ oii ] emission and balmer absorption lines .",
    "the spectroscopic information resolves the on - going star formation activity and recent star formation history of the galaxies , which can not be resolved by colours ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on one of the clusters from our pisces sample , rxj0152.71357 at @xmath0 , for which we already have a complete optical data - set with suprime - cam @xcite .",
    "the cluster rxj0152.71357 ( rxj0153 for short ) is one of the most x - ray luminous distant ( @xmath9 ) clusters known .",
    "it was discovered by various x - ray surveys @xcite . since these discoveries",
    ", the cluster has been investigated in various ways : x - ray observations @xcite , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , near - ir imaging @xcite , and the weak lensing analysis @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite presented spectroscopic studies on this cluster .",
    "recently , @xcite discussed dynamical properties of this cluster in detail .",
    "we photometrically discovered large - scale structures around rxj0153 based on the subaru data as reported in @xcite .",
    "however , the photometric identification of the structures is subject to projection effects",
    ". the discovered structures might be chance projections of galaxies along the line of sight . to confirm the structures against the projection effects ,",
    "a spectroscopic follow - up observation was carried out . in this paper , we first present spectroscopic confirmation of the structures at @xmath1 .",
    "we then discuss detailed star formation histories of galaxies from the spectra and constrain physical processes that trigger the truncation of star formation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we briefly review our photometric identification of large - scale structures at @xmath1 around rxj0153 .",
    "our spectroscopic observations of rxj0153 and data reduction are described as well . then we present results of the spectroscopic observation in section [ sec : lss ] , and we address star formation histories of galaxies in section [ sec : sfh ] .",
    "implications of our results are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , the paper is summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .    throughout this paper , we assume a flat universe of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "magnitudes are on the ab system .",
    "we briefly review the photometric identification of large - scale structures at @xmath1 .",
    "readers are refereed to @xcite for details .    we observed rxj0153 with suprime - cam in @xmath12 under excellent conditions .",
    "the seeing was @xmath13 in all bands .",
    "since the cluster lie at a high redshift and our imaging is deep ( we can reach @xmath14 galaxies at the cluster redshift ) , galaxies at the cluster redshift are heavily contaminated by fore-/background galaxies . to reduce the contamination , we applied the photometric redshift code of @xcite and extracted galaxies around the cluster redshift .",
    "the distribution of photo-@xmath15 selected galaxies revealed a highly disturbed shape of rxj0153  the cluster is elongated along the ne ",
    "sw direction and it accompanies clumpy subgroups . in particular , the wide field of view ( abbreviated as fov in what follows ) of the suprime - cam has enabled us to discover a number of groups / clusters surrounding the central cluster .",
    "however , it is unclear if these groups and clusters are physically associated to the central cluster due to the wide redshift slice adopted ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this wide range was chosen so that we do not miss galaxies at the cluster redshifts due to the error in the photometric redshifts .",
    "the discovered systems could lie at different redshifts within the above redshift range .",
    "moreover , the projection effect is a concern . some of these systems could be chance projections of galaxies along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , more accurate redshift measurements based on spectroscopic observations are essential to identify real physical associations to the main body of the cluster .",
    "we conducted a spectroscopic follow - up observation during 1114 october 2004 with focas @xcite in mos mode .",
    "we used a 300 lines @xmath17 grating blazed at 5500 @xmath18 with the order - cut filter sy47 .",
    "the wavelength coverage was between 4700@xmath4 and 9400 @xmath4 with a pixel resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "a slit width was set to @xmath20 , which gave a resolution of @xmath21 .",
    "we selected 8 focas fields which efficiently cover the large - scale structure traced by photometry as shown in fig .",

    "target galaxies were primarily selected on the basis of photometric redshifts .",
    "galaxies at @xmath22 were given the highest priority in the mask design .",

    "roughly 60 percent of the targeted galaxies fall in this photo-@xmath15 range .",
    "each mask had about 40 slits .",
    "target galaxies are located towards one side of each fov of focas .",
    "this is to optimize the wavelength coverage of a spectrum so that we can observe the most important spectral features of galaxies at the cluster redshift ( e.g. [ oii ] and caii h+k ) .",

    "we do not correct for the galactic extinction .",
    "all the reduced 1d/2d spectra are visually inspected using purpose written software .",
    "rough redshift estimates and redshift confidence flags ( @xmath24 ) are then assigned to each object .",
    "objects with secure / probable redshift estimates are flagged as @xmath25 , and objects with likely redshifts are flagged as @xmath26 .",
    "the flag @xmath26 is basically assigned to low-@xmath23 galaxies .",
    "important spectroscopic features ( e.g. caii h+k ) are sometimes heavily contaminated by the night sky emissions and in this case we assigned @xmath26 .",

    "we note that this error should be considered as a rough estimate .",
    "note as well that it does not include an error in the wavelength calibration , which is typically @xmath27 .",

    "[ fig : photoz_accuracy ] , we find that the galaxies at @xmath39 have systematically lower @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out that most of these galaxies are blue galaxies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photoz_colour_dep ] .",
    "a few very red galaxies show deviant redshifts ( e.g. three red galaxies at @xmath43 ) .",
    "we find that these galaxies show slightly redder colours than our reddest model colours .",
    "these are likely to be heavily dust obscured galaxies , though such population is rare .",
    "the deviation of the bluest galaxies can be explained by the fact that we lack model templates for such very blue galaxies @xcite .",
    "the bluest galaxies can not be fit by any of the templates and thus the photo-@xmath15 outputs very deviant redshifts .",
    "as for the deviation of the galaxies with blue - to - intermediate colours at @xmath44 , we speculate that our filter set ( @xmath12 ) is no longer optimal .",
    "we do not cover a wide enough wavelength range ( particularly in uv ) to reliably estimate redshifts of blue galaxies that do not show prominent sed features @xcite . adding @xmath45-band will improve the situation .    from the results presented in our previous paper",
    "( see fig . 1 of @xcite )",
    ", we have expected that only the galaxies with intermediate colours would show deviant photometric redshifts at the cluster redshift .",
    "we do not , however , observe this trend in our large spectroscopic sample . at the cluster redshift ,",
    "even the intermediate colour galaxies are given reasonably accurate photometric redshifts , and only the bluest galaxies tend to deviate .",
    "it may be the case that the deviation of intermediate colour galaxies could be characteristic of @xmath46 galaxies ( for which we saw the trend in @xcite ) .",
    "given the small number of spectroscopic galaxies at that redshift in our current sample , we can not pursue this issue further at this point .",
    "the colour dependence tells us that we have to be careful when discussing a fraction of red / blue galaxies ( e.g. butcher - oemler effect ) based on photo-@xmath15 .",
    "it is expected to be a general trend that the photometric redshifts are less accurate for blue galaxies than for red galaxies due to the less strong sed features .",
    "this colour dependent photo-@xmath15 accuracy would tend to underestimate a fraction of blue galaxies , and could weaken evolutionary trends .",
    "we note , however , that this colour dependence does not change the primary conclusions presented in @xcite .",
    "they reported the build - up of the colour - magnitude relation from @xmath0 to @xmath47 in field , group , and cluster environments .",
    "their results are not strongly affected since they focused on red galaxies whose photometric redshifts are accurate .",
    "further discussions can be found in that paper .    finally , we revisit the distribution of photo-@xmath15 selected galaxies with more optimal photo-@xmath15 and colour cuts . following the true error distribution shown in fig .",

    "we infer star formation histories of galaxies from their spectroscopic signatures as a function of environment . here",
    "we use our spectra only . @xcite and @xcite focused only on the main cluster and data for other environments ( groups in particular ) are not available .",
    "a typical @xmath23 of our spectra is not high enough to quantify the spectroscopic properties of galaxies on an individual basis .",
    "we thus composite a number of spectra to make a high @xmath23 spectrum as was done by , for example , @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the red galaxies ( those having @xmath53 with respect to the colour - magnitude relation ) .",
    "we do not examine blue galaxies because photometric redshifts are not accurate for blue galaxies , and we can not avoid a selection bias ( e.g. we miss very blue galaxies ) .",

    "a composite `` group '' spectrum is made from the red galaxies in f4 , f6 , and f7 .",

    "we apply the 2-dimensional k - s test @xcite for the distribution of galaxies on the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "it does not reject the hypothesis that the colours and magnitudes of the `` cluster '' red galaxies and those of the `` group '' red galaxies are drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "therefore , the red galaxies in clusters and those in groups share the common photometric properties and the only obvious difference is their environment . however , the k - s probability is found to be smaller between `` cluster '' and `` field '' ( @xmath58 ) and `` group '' and `` field '' ( @xmath58 ) . hence , field red galaxies may have slightly different photometric properties .",
    "[ fig : spec_comb ] compares the composite spectra .",
    "the continua of the cluster and the group spectra are very similar and are typical of red passively evolving galaxies , consistent with the common photometric properties as discussed above .",

    "although the continuum of the field spectrum is similar to those of cluster and group galaxies , differences can be seen , e.g. at @xmath60 , which leads to the difference in the strength of 4000 break ( section [ sec : spec_diag ] ) .",

    "we adopt the h@xmath62 index defined by @xcite .",
    "this index uses a narrower window than that of h@xmath63 .",
    "since our spectra are not of very high @xmath23 , a narrower window that excludes the tails of absorption line features is better suited .",

    "note as well that we include both blue galaxies and red galaxies to show that our models , which we describe later , well reproduce various star formation histories of galaxies at @xmath47 .",

    "a fundamental question here is the evolutional and environmental connection between galaxies at @xmath1 and those at @xmath47 .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that the colours of group and cluster red galaxies are indistinguishable ( see section [ sec : composite_spectra ] ) .",
    "interestingly , there is a hint that the h@xmath62 absorption is stronger for group red galaxies than for the cluster one .",
    "this may suggest that the group galaxies have had recent star formation at @xmath61 gyr prior to the observed epoch .",

    "we consider three star formation histories to represent the star formation histories of red galaxies .",
    "one is an instantaneous starburst model , and another is exponentially decaying model with a decay time scale of @xmath74 and 2 gyr .",
    "the other is a constant star formation model with a starburst at @xmath75 gyr since the onset of star formation , and the star formation is truncated immediately after the burst .",
    "we consider the three starburst strengths ; stars that are newly born in the burst amount to 0% , 10% , and 100% of the mass of the existing stars .",

    "therefore , the h@xmath62 indices of group and field galaxies are clearly larger compared to normal star forming galaxies . field red galaxies could be fit by a burst+sharp truncation model .",
    "however , they still show a sign of star formation and their star formation is not completely quenched yet .",
    "it is interesting to note that 0% , 30% , and 80% of individual cluster , group , and field red galaxies show [ oii ] emissions .    the group red galaxies can not be reproduced by any of our model .",
    "in fact , few local galaxies populate around the group galaxies on the h@xmath62@xmath5 plane .",
    "one may suspect that the correction for the emission filling is not reliable .",
    "however , the correction applied for the red group galaxies is small ( @xmath81h@xmath82 ) , and whether or not we apply the correction does not significantly alter the result",
    ". it could be due to the dust extinction which makes their colours red @xcite , although we do not attempt to perform detailed modeling of dust extinction in this paper .",
    "as the `` tau '' model demonstrates , a gradual truncation of star formation does not enhance the h@xmath62 absorption and fail to reproduce the group red galaxies .",
    "the observed strong h@xmath6 absorption favours a scenario that the star formation is suppressed in a short time scale rather than a slow decline .",

    "therefore , red [ oii ] emitters tend to avoid the dense cluster core in consistent with demarco et al.s result .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed analysis of absorption lines of galaxies in the rxj0153 cluster .",
    "their results are somewhat different from ours  they suggested that the @xmath5 does not evolve from @xmath0 to @xmath47 , although they also reported that the evolution of @xmath45-band luminosity and high order balmer lines ( h@xmath6 and h@xmath84 ) are consistent with the passive evolution since @xmath85 .",
    "we find that this difference in the evolution of @xmath5 comes from a difference in @xmath47 data .",
    "there is no significant difference between our @xmath5 measurements and their @xmath5 measurements for the @xmath0 sample , @xmath86 .",
    "however , for red galaxies at @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath87 from the sdss data , while they obtained @xmath88 from their own perseus and abell 194 data .",
    "we note that the value @xmath88 seems to be inconsistent with model predictions for evolved red galaxies at @xmath47 .",
    "however , we can not conclusively figure out the cause of the difference in @xmath5 in the @xmath47 samples at this stage .",
    "we note that @xcite also reported that some scaling relations for metal indices , which we do not explore in this paper , are also inconsistent with the passive evolution .",
    "@xcite suggested that the truncation of star formation starts from massive galaxies and fainter galaxies stop their star formation later , and galaxies follow down - sizing evolution @xcite .",
    "they showed that , at @xmath0 , a clear colour - magnitude relation is seen down to @xmath89 in cluster environments . on the other hand , in group environments , only the bright - end ( @xmath90 ) of the relation",
    "faint red galaxies do not form a tight relation . in field environments , no clear relation is seen even at the bright - end .",
    "they therefore suggested that the down - sizing is likely to depend on environments  down - sizing is delayed in low - density environments .",
    "our results in the previous section support the picture that the truncation of star formation is delayed in lower - density environments . while the colour - magnitude distributions of the cluster and the group red galaxies are identical , the group red galaxies show a weak emission with a strong h@xmath6 absorption , which are not seen in the cluster spectrum .",
    "this means that the group red galaxies must have had recent star formation activities , while the cluster red galaxies have not formed stars for a long time .",
    "the truncation of field galaxies would occur even later since the field red galaxies are still actively forming stars",
    ". it may be reasonable to consider that cluster red galaxies have stopped star formation well in advance , while group red galaxies are just in the process of truncation , and the field red galaxies have not even stopped star formation .",
    "star formation activities reflect an evolutionary stage of the colour - magnitude build - up . the red cluster and group galaxies show no / little star formation activities , and the bright - end of the colour - magnitude relation in these regions is already built - up .",
    "on the other hand , field red galaxies show rather active star formation and they do not form a tight relation .",
    "@xcite reported that the bright - end of the field colour - magnitude relation is built - up down to @xmath91 .",
    "we expect that the star formation activities of field red galaxies become significantly weaker by @xmath47 .",
    "what physical mechanism truncates star formation activities ?",
    "a hint for this question lies in groups .",
    "group galaxies form a colour - magnitude relation at the bright - end , but not at the faint - end .",
    "this should indicate that the bright - end of the relation is built - up recently ; the star formation rates of bright galaxies in groups dropped in a recent past .",
    "a close inspection of group galaxies will therefore provide a clue to the physical driver of the truncation .",
    "there are at least two possible physical mechanisms that can truncate star formation activities in groups : galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. @xcite ) and strangulation @xcite .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions trigger starbursts and star formation is truncated after the burst .",
    "strangulation gradually truncates star formation over @xmath71 gyr .",
    "these processes can be differentiated by the h@xmath6 absorption ",
    "starburst+truncation enhances the h@xmath6 absorption after the burst , while strangulation does not trigger the enhancement .",
    "this is shown by the model predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd_d4000 ] ( strangulation should follow a similar track to the `` tau '' model ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that a sudden truncation of star formation without burst ( 0% burst ) also enhances the h@xmath6 absorption .",
    "ram - pressure stripping @xcite will truncate star formation in a relatively short time scale , and the model suggests ram - pressure stripping could explain the observed h@xmath6 absorption . however , ram - pressure stripping is not effective in groups , and this is not a viable mechanism .",
    "the observed strong h@xmath6 absorption in groups then lends support to the scenario that star formation is quenched in a short time scale , though the group spectra can not be reproduced by our fiducial burst model .",
    "it could be that group galaxies experience dusty starbursts , but the exploration of the dust effects awaits a larger number of higher-@xmath23 spectra .",
    "it seems that galaxy - galaxy interactions would be a viable mechanism .",
    "interestingly , we find that a composite spectrum of red galaxies in the filamentary structures ( f2 and f3 in fig [ fig : target_fields ] ) shows a very similar properties to the group composite spectra , in the sense that @xmath5 and h@xmath62 agree within the errors .",
    "strangulation can not be effective in filaments and this would further support galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "further discriminations between the physical drivers can be made with the information of morphology .",
    "on one hand , strong interactions destroy a disk structure and transform spiral galaxies into elliptical galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "strangulation do not strongly disturb a disk structure , and it would transform spiral galaxies into s0 galaxies",
    ". therefore , the dominant population in groups will give an independent clue to the physical driver of the truncation of star formation .",
    "although the mergers between red galaxies may erase this important dynamical footprint @xcite , the morphological information is still essential in order to identify the physical driver more conclusively .    in this paper , we confirm the environmental dependence of star formation of bright red galaxies at @xmath92 .",
    "however , the down - sizing phenomenon remains unexplored . to spectroscopically confirm the down - sizing",
    ", we should go fainter than @xmath93 . to reach such faint magnitudes",
    "is difficult even with an 8-m telescope . in this paper , we reach only @xmath94 and a number of spectra in each environment is still small .",
    "for these reasons , we do not attempt to discuss the down - sizing at this bright magnitude range .",
    "we expect that faint red galaxies show more active star formation than bright red galaxies in the same environment .",
    "that is , an epoch of star formation truncation of faint galaxies comes later than that of bright galaxies .",
    "another forecast is that bright red galaxies in groups show similar spectra to faint red galaxies in clusters due to the environmental dependence of the down - sizing effect .",
    "data from intensive spectroscopic observations will be able to address these points .    finally , we recall that our results are based only on one cluster field at @xmath1 .",
    "a larger sample is essential to step forward .",
    "a typical @xmath23 of the individual spectrum presented in this paper is low , and the spectra may be affected by systematic uncertainties",
    ". a larger number of higher @xmath23 spectra are clearly needed to confirm our results and to further explore star formation histories of galaxies with various metallicity and dust extinctions as a function of environment and address the down - sizing effect .",
    "we conducted a spectroscopic observation of rxj0153 at @xmath0 with focas on subaru , and we obtained 161 secure redshifts . by combining with redshifts from @xcite and @xcite , we constructed a spectroscopic sample of 347 galaxies .",
    "our primary conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "note that conclusions 1 and 3 are drawn from our own sample , and conslusion 2 is from the whole sample .",
    "+ 1  we spectroscopically confirmed the large - scale structures at @xmath1 , which were first identified photometrically by @xcite based on the panoramic imaging data .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts show a sharp spike at @xmath95 , which is much narrower than the redshift width used for our photometric selection of member candidates .",
    "this is strong evidence for large - scale structures associated to the central cluster .",
    "there seems to be two large sheets of galaxies : one at @xmath2 hosting the main body of the cluster extending from north to south , and the other at @xmath96 extending from ne to ssw .",
    "they are likely in the process of interaction .",
    "+ 2  the accuracy of our photometric redshifts depends on galaxy seds .",
    "photometric redshifts are fairly accurate for red galaxies , while they are less accurate for blue galaxies .",
    "we therefore have to be careful when we discuss a fraction of red / blue galaxies ( e.g. butcher - oemler effect ) based on phot-@xmath15 .",
    "+ 3  we infer star formation histories of @xmath1 red galaxies in the field , group , and cluster environments .",
    "we quantify the @xmath5 and h@xmath62 indices , and compare them with those of sdss galaxies at @xmath47 and those from model predictions .",
    "red cluster galaxies at @xmath1 have not formed stars for @xmath97 gyr in the past , and the passive evolution can naturally link them to present - day red galaxies .",
    "red galaxies in groups and in the field at @xmath1 show evidence for recent activities of star formation as indicated by their relatively strong h@xmath6 absorptions .",
    "our current data seem to favour a scenario that star formation is quenched in a short time scale in groups , and galaxy - galaxy interactions would be a viable mechanism .",
    "however , higher @xmath23 data are needed to confirm this .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss possible sources of uncertainties in our @xmath5 and h@xmath62 measurements .",

    "flux calibration : + no absolute flux calibration is required for the measurements of @xmath5 and h@xmath62 , and the question here is how accurate the relative flux is over the spectral features .",
    "the h@xmath62 index adopts a pseudo - continuum around the absorption feature , and thus a fluxing error should not affect h@xmath62 in a significant way . as for @xmath5 ,",
    "an accuracy of sdss flux at the bluest wavelengths is on the order of a few percent @xcite .",
    "a relative flux is more accurate than this , and hence @xmath5 of the sdss galaxies is expected to be accurate to less than a few per cent .",
    "the flux calibration for rxj0153 should be reliable since the @xmath5 feature lies around the centre of our spectral wavelength coverage .",
    "we therefore expect the flux error does not affect our @xmath5 and h@xmath62 measurements in a significant way .",
    "galactic extinction : + both our spectra and the sdss spectra are not corrected for the galactic extinction .",
    "we estimate e(@xmath98)=0.015 for rxj0153 from the dust map of @xcite . a typical e(@xmath98 ) of sdss galaxies",
    "is 0.03 to 0.04 .",
    "since the @xmath5 index is measured in a relatively small wavelength window , the dust extinction affects our @xmath5 measurements by only @xmath71% .",
    "we therefore expect our results are robust to the galactic extinction .",
    "telluric extinction : + for @xmath1 galaxies , strong telluric extinction ( a - band ) lies around the spectral features in interest such as h@xmath6 .",
    "we have corrected for this extinction ( section [ sec : spec_obs ] ) , but we speculate that we have over / under corrected by @xmath9910% .",
    "the composite spectra are generated from galaxies at slightly different redshifts , and this uncertainty should be reduced to some extent . however , it is difficult to evaluate this uncertainty in our composite spectra . the @xmath5 and h@xmath62 indices measured from the sdss galaxies are free from the strong telluric extinctions .",
    "the remaining concern is the effect of systematic uncertainties , particularly in the @xmath1 sample .",
    "it is a difficult task to evaluate them .",
    "however , the fact that our @xmath5 measurements are in good agreement with those by @xcite suggests that systematic uncertainties do not dominate the overall error budget .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey is performed with the fibre - fed spectrographs .",
    "each fibre subtends @xmath100 on the sky , which is much smaller than a typical size of galaxies at @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a typical extraction aperture adopted in our spectroscopic data reduction for @xmath1 galaxies is roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of a size of a galaxy .",
    "thus , an extraction aperture adopted in the sdss is smaller compared to that for @xmath1 galaxies in a physical size .",
    "this may artificially make differences between @xmath47 and @xmath1 in the spectral features explored in section [ sec : spec_diag ] .",
    "we argue in the following , however , our conclusions are robust to this aperture bias .    in order to quantify the aperture bias , we use spectroscopic data of nearby galaxies from @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the data is that the spectra are obtained for both the nuclear region and the entire region of a galaxy ( nuclear and integrated spectra , respectively ) .",
    "the nuclear spectra typically include 10% of the light encluded in the @xmath102 isophote , while the integrated spectra include 80% on average .",
    "although the extraction aperture adopted in @xcite is different from that of sdss , comparisons between the nuclear and integrated spectra will give an estimate of how the aperture bias affects our measurement , at least qualitatively .",
    "the spectra are smoothed to our instrumental resolution , and @xmath5 and h@xmath62 are measured ( again the emission filling is corrected ) .",
    "we do not apply any magnitude cut to the @xcite sample to gain the statistics .",
    "our aim here is not to compare the integrated spectra with our spectra of @xmath1 galaxies , but to investigate the aperture bias .",
    "comparisons between the nuclear and integrated spectra are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : aperture_bias ] . while the overall correlation is encouragingly good , deviations are seen .",
    "the integrated spectra show systematically smaller @xmath5 than the nuclear spectra at @xmath103 .",
    "that is , these galaxies show bluer colours at the outer parts of the galaxies compared to the inner parts .",
    "this is expected since active star formation is often observed in a disk rather than in a bulge .",
    "very red / blue galaxies do now show such deviation . as for h@xmath62 ,",
    "the correlation between the integrated and nuclear spectra is relatively good , but a tail toward higher h@xmath104 is seen . despite these tails , however , the distribution of galaxies on the h@xmath62@xmath5 plane is basically the same for the nuclear and integrated spectra .",
    "furthermore , for our sdss sample , spectroscopic fibre typically collects 20% of the total @xmath105-band light of a galaxy .",
    "thus the aperture bias should be smaller than that we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture_bias ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the aperture bias has no significant effect on our conclusions .",
    "note that the integrated spectra seem to show a smaller scatter on the @xmath5h@xmath62 plane than the nuclear spectra .",
