    "relativistic jets in astrophysical sources have been known for many decades . although their enormous power , large lorentz factor and strong collimation have been widely studied , these phenomena still lack an accepted explanation .",
    "an even greater mystery is the remarkable coherence and apparent stability of jets over very large length scales .",
    "this is the topic of the present paper .",
    "the most promising models of relativistic jets involve acceleration and collimation by magnetic fields with footpoints attached to a spinning black hole or neutron star or accretion disk .",
    "the forced rotation of the field lines induces a strong toroidal component of the magnetic field , which is responsible for accelerating the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ; and references therein ) . in this picture",
    "the toroidal component of the field dominates over other field components .    according to the well - known kruskal - shafranov criterion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cylindrical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) configurations in which the toroidal field dominates are violently unstable to the @xmath4 kink instability ( also called the screw instability ) . the ks criterion for instability",
    "is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the toroidal and poloidal magnetic field strengths , @xmath0 is the cylindrical radius of the jet and @xmath12 is the length of the jet ( i.e. , distance from the base of the jet ) .",
    "typical jet models , including the ones described in this paper ( see  2.2 ) , have @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lorentz factor of the jet , and they have jet angles @xmath15 . substituting these scalings in equation ( [ kscriterion ] ) , it is obvious that the ks instability criterion is easily satisfied in relativistic jets .",
    "we therefore expect astrophysical jets to be violently unstable , as argued for example by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "yet , jets in nature are apparently quite stable .",
    "how is this possible ?",
    "many authors have investigated this question .",
    "they have used jet models with a variety of velocity profiles , geometrical shapes , composition and boundary conditions @xcite , and applied both analytical and numerical methods @xcite . as a result of this large body of work ,",
    "several kinds of unstable modes have been identified : reflection modes , kelvin - helmholtz modes , current - carrying modes , etc .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to synthesize the results and extract universal principles .    a fruitful approach in this field is to reduce relativistic jet models to their barest minimum .",
    "one such approach is to consider _ force - free _ jet models in which one ignores the inertia and pressure of the plasma and considers only charges , currents and fields .",
    "the force - free approximation is valid whenever the energy density in fields dominates over matter energy density , as in pulsar magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "the force - free approximation is valid also in relativistic mhd jets , at least inside the fast surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical studies of force - free jets have led to the identification of two distinct stability criteria . in a detailed analysis",
    ", @xcite showed that cylindrical force - free jets in which @xmath16 is independent of @xmath2 are stable .",
    "@xcite considered models with non - constant @xmath16 and showed that force - free jets are unstable if @xmath17 i.e. , if the poloidal field decreases with increasing distance from the axis .",
    "we refer to equation ( [ iplcriterion ] ) as the ipl criterion for instability . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed via an approximate analysis that force - free jets are unstable if @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angular velocity of the field line .",
    "this criterion  the tmt criterion  differs from the ks criterion ( [ kscriterion ] ) in that it explicitly accounts for rotation .",
    "it is also apparently very different from the ipl criterion .",
    "we describe in this paper a class of force - free cylindrical jet equilibria which closely match the numerical force - free jet simulations reported in . within the context of force - free jets from rigidly - rotating stars ,",
    "we believe that this two - parameter family of equilibria is generic and fairly complete .",
    "we study the stability properties of these equilibria and attempt to relate our results to the ks , ipl and tmt criteria ( eqs .",
    "[ kscriterion ] , [ iplcriterion ] and [ tmtcriterion ] ) .",
    "in  2 we summarize the numerical simulation results of (  2.1 ) and we describe an analytical force - free jet model which matches the simulation data very closely (  2.2 ) . in ",
    "3 we carry out a linear stability analysis of these equilibria and show that the linear modes of the system are obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem involving two coupled differential equations , with appropriate boundary conditions . in ",
    "4 we numerically solve the equations and identify the unstable modes in the system .",
    "we also derive an approximate estimate for the growth rate of the instability .",
    "we conclude in  5 with a summary and discussion .",
    "we use @xmath20 for spherical coordinates and @xmath21 for cylindrical coordinates .",
    "considered a rigidly - rotating star of unit radius ( @xmath22 ) surrounded by a differentially - rotating infinitely thin disk extending from @xmath23 outward .",
    "the star was threaded by a uniform radial magnetic field @xmath24 , and the disk was threaded by a power - law distribution of vertical field , @xmath25 using a relativistic force - free code @xcite , numerically evolved the system and obtained the equilibrium configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "following , we will call the field lines that emerge from the star as the `` jet '' and the field lines from the disk as the `` wind . ''",
    "the critical field line that emerges from the star - disk boundary defines the boundary between the jet and the wind .",
    "this boundary starts off at @xmath26 at the surface of the star ( @xmath27 ) but decreases to smaller values of @xmath28 with increasing @xmath29 ( or @xmath12 ) .",
    "we are primarily interested in the `` jet ''  the bundle of field lines attached to the central star . since all of these field lines rotate at the angular velocity @xmath19 of the star , the alfvn surface for these lines takes the form of a cylinder",
    " the `` light cylinder ''  with radius @xmath30 .",
    "field lines become strongly toroidal once they are outside the alfvn surface , which is where most of the collimation and acceleration occurs ( ) .",
    "showed that the structure of the jet is strongly affected by the radial pressure profile of the region surrounding the jet . specifically ,",
    "if we write the radial variation of the confining pressure as @xmath31 , the jet properties are determined by the value of @xmath32 . in the numerical experiments ,",
    "the pressure was caused by a force - free disk wind , and @xmath32 was determined by the index @xmath33 defined in equation ( [ bznu ] ) according to @xmath34 at distance @xmath12 along the axis , the cylindrical radius @xmath0 of the jet is approximately given by @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , the jet collimates as it moves away from the star @xcite .",
    "as a result , at a sufficiently large distance from the central star ( @xmath37 ) , the jet is nearly cylindrical in shape .    in the asymptotic nearly - cylindrical region of the jet ,",
    "force balance in the @xmath2 direction is described by the following equation ( ): @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total magnetic field strength , @xmath10 is the toroidal field strength , and @xmath11 is the poloidal field strength : @xmath40 the electric field @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath19 is the angular velocity of the field line .",
    "the electric field has only a poloidal component : @xmath43 .",
    "each of the three terms on the left - hand side of equation ( [ balance ] ) represents a force in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is the pressure of the force - free fluid in the comoving frame ; therefore , the first term describes the inward force due to the gradient of pressure .",
    "the second term arises from the toroidal curvature of the field line .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field @xmath10 contributes an inward force due to `` hoop stress , '' while the poloidal electric field @xmath46 contributes an outward force . )",
    ", @xmath41 is directly proportional to @xmath19 , so the latter term results from rotation and may loosely be viewed as a sort of `` centrifugal force '' ( v. beskin , private communication ) . ]",
    "the third term in ( [ balance ] ) gives analogous contributions from the poloidal curvature of the field line , where @xmath47 is the poloidal radius of curvature ; once again there is an inward force due to the poloidal magnetic hoop stress and an outward force due to the electric field .",
    "note that the contributions involving @xmath46 are important only for relativistic flows . in standard non - relativistic mhd",
    ", one neglects these terms and keeps only the terms involving @xmath39",
    ".    showed that models with @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 , are good analogs of relativistic jets found in nature ( especially the jets of gamma - ray burst ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows numerical results corresponding to the `` fiducial '' force - free simulation in with @xmath50 ( equivalent to @xmath51 ) .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) show results for a relatively near region of the jet at @xmath52 , and panels ( c ) and ( d ) show results for a more distant region at @xmath53 . in each case",
    ", the abscissa corresponds to the cylindrical radius @xmath2 normalized by the local `` jet radius '' @xmath0 , which is the cylindrical radius of the last jet field line that separates the jet from the surrounding disk wind .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the main features of the numerical solution are as follows .",
    "first , from panels ( a ) and ( c ) we see that @xmath11 is essentially constant inside the jet , showing hardly any variation with @xmath2 . as we show in appendix  [ sec_bp_const ] , this is required for force - free jet solutions that smoothly connect to the central compact object .",
    "are certainly possible @xcite , but there exists no solution that would smoothly connect them to the compact object . ]",
    "second , since @xmath19 is constant and @xmath54 ( eq . [ efield ] ) , we have @xmath55 .",
    "third , @xmath10 is almost equal to @xmath46 and so @xmath10 also varies primarily as @xmath56 .",
    "fourth , @xmath57 is slightly larger than @xmath46 with @xmath58 .",
    "because of this property , the first two terms in equation ( [ balance ] ) both give an inward force .",
    "therefore , we obtain the fifth feature of the solution , viz . , the third term in ( [ balance ] ) , which involves the poloidal curvature of the field line , is important for force balance .",
    "this is the only outward force in the balance equation ",
    "it is outward because @xmath46 is of order @xmath10 and is much greater than @xmath11 outside the light cylinder .",
    "this force has to balance the other two terms .",
    "the velocity of a force - free flow is usually identified with the drift velocity , @xmath59 and the lorentz factor is defined correspondingly . since @xmath60 , it is easily shown that @xmath61 panels ( b ) and ( d ) show the variation of @xmath62 as a function of the normalized cylindrical radius @xmath63 in the numerical model .",
    "derived two approximate relations for @xmath62 , @xmath64^{1/2 } , \\label{gamma1 } \\\\ \\gamma_2 & = & ( 3r_c / r)^{1/2 } , \\label{gamma2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and they showed that the net @xmath62 of the fluid is given to good accuracy by the following simple formula , @xmath65 along each field line , @xmath62 is initially determined mainly by rotation , and so @xmath66 .",
    "this is a region of efficient acceleration which called the _ first acceleration regime_. however , beyond a certain distance from the star , the effect of poloidal field line curvature becomes important , and @xmath62 switches to the less efficient @xmath67 , the _ second acceleration regime_.    relatively near the star , all field lines in the jet are in the first acceleration regime and @xmath1 behaves like @xmath68 ( eq . [ gamma1 ] ) , as seen in panel ( b ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath62 increases more or less linearly with @xmath2 and reaches its maximum value at the edge of the jet at @xmath69 .",
    "however , when we consider the jet at a larger distance from the star , some of the field lines have already switched to the second acceleration regime , where @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "[ gamma2 ] , coupled with eq .",
    "[ rc ] below ) .",
    "we then have the results shown in panel ( d ) , where the maximum lorentz factor occurs at some radius @xmath71 inside the jet , not at the boundary ; we have @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "discuss in detail the physics of the two acceleration regimes .",
    "the axisymmetric numerical jets models described in  2.1 have magnetic and electric field components that are functions of both @xmath2 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is not convenient for linear perturbation analysis .",
    "since the numerical models are nearly cylindrical at large distance ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) , we consider now an idealized jet equilibrium model which is perfectly cylindrical and in which all quantities are functions only of @xmath2 .",

    "also , we have assumed that @xmath81 and @xmath19 are positive , so both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are negative , i.e. , magnetic field lines are swept backward with respect to the rotation and the electric field is pointed radially inward . with this choice of signs ,",
    "the three functions , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , are positive .",
    "note that , in all cases of interest , @xmath85 is practically equal to unity .",
    "the particular exponential form given in equation ( [ b0z ] ) is designed to handle small higher - order terms in the force balance equation ( [ balance2 ] ) , but the deviations of @xmath85 from unity are tiny and unimportant . given in eq .",
    "( [ b0z ] ) and with the simpler choice @xmath87 .",
    "the results are practically the same . ]    by direct substitution it is easily verified that the above model satisfies the radial force balance equation ( [ balance ] ) . under cylindrical symmetry , this equation takes the form : @xmath88 the first two terms are positive , i.e. , both represent inward forces , with the first term providing twice as much force as the second .",
    "the third term is negative and its magnitude is equal to the sum of the other two terms .",
    "an important feature of the above model is that the outward force from the third term involves the poloidal curvature radius @xmath47 .",
    "technically , a perfectly cylindrical model has @xmath89 . to get around this problem , we treat @xmath47 as an externally imposed property of the solution which",
    "is adjusted so as to reproduce the poloidal curvature force present in the numerical jet model . in other words , even though we have straightened out field lines in the @xmath12-direction by enforcing cylindrical geometry , we still retain the effect of poloidal curvature by means of an artificial external force .",
    "this procedure is analogous to the widely - used shearing sheet approximation in accretion disk studies @xcite in which fluid streamlines are straightened out in the azimuthal direction , but the effect of azimuthal curvature is still retained via a coriolis force .",
    "note that , apart from the extra term due to poloidal field curvature , equation ( [ balance ] ) is identical to the standard balance condition derived in other papers in the literature , e.g. , equation ( 6 ) in @xcite or equation ( 16 ) in @xcite .    to get a better idea of the nature of the above analytical model",
    ", we now make a couple of simplifications .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath81 is practically independent of @xmath2 inside the jet .",
    "also , for highly relativistic jets , we invariably have @xmath90 .",
    "we therefore replace equations ( [ b0phi ] ) , ( [ b0z ] ) and ( [ e0r ] ) by the following simpler formulae @xmath91^{1/2}(r / r_m ) , \\\\ b_{0\\phi}^2-e^2 & = & ( r / r_m)^4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by equation ( [ efield ] ) , the angular velocity of rotation of the field lines is given by @xmath92 and is the same for all field lines , as required for a rigidly rotating star at the base of the jet .. it would be straightforward to generalize the model to non - constant @xmath93 , using additional parameters .",
    "] using these simpler expressions , we obtain the following result for the lorentz factor : @xmath94 where we have made use of equations ( [ rc ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) . we thus reproduce the result given earlier in equation ( [ gamma ] ) .",

    "this can be shown from an initial condition analysis along the lines of landau s treatment of plasma damping .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed discussion of this topic .",
    "we have not exhaustively explored modes with @xmath234 . however , in spot tests with various choices of @xmath160 , @xmath189 and @xmath191 in models a , b and c , all modes were found to be stable .",
    "we believe that , if at all , there are only weakly unstable modes for @xmath234 ; there is no sign of the kind of vigorous instability described in  4.2 for modes with @xmath196 .",
    "so why is @xmath196 special ?",
    "the answer to this question is well - known in the magnetic confinement literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    ", we find @xmath239 by symmetry , the velocity goes to zero on the axis , and the flow consists of a simple radial divergence .",
    "consider next modes with @xmath240 .",
    "using equation ( [ e1zm ] ) for @xmath130 , we find @xmath241 where we have included @xmath242 to show the angular dependence of the mode .",
    "the leading term goes like @xmath243 , which corresponds to @xmath244 when @xmath196 .",
    "this means that the mode has a finite radial velocity , and hence a finite radial displacement , on the axis when @xmath245 .",
    "the @xmath246 dependence of @xmath235 , coupled with the fact that @xmath247 has the same amplitude but a @xmath248 dependence , ensures that the velocity vector is unique and analytic at @xmath80 . by writing the velocity vector in cartesian coordinates",
    ", it is easily seen that the complex phase of @xmath235 determines the orientation of the velocity vector in the @xmath249-plane .",
    "if we consider values of @xmath250 , the velocity vanishes on the axis , just as in the case of @xmath168 .",
    "this then reveals what is special about @xmath245 modes .",
    "these are the only modes in which fluid perturbations communicate across the axis and cause the jet to shift bodily across the axis . in modes with @xmath245 the center of mass of the jet itself shifts into a spiral shape , which is the characteristic feature of the kink or screw mode .",
    "for all other values of @xmath251 , the center of mass remains on the axis and the perturbations are concentrated on the outside .    in helical mhd configurations in the laboratory",
    ", the @xmath245 kink mode is known to be highly unstable and to be the greatest threat to the stability of equilibria @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly we see the same feature in our force - free jet equilibria .",
    "the growth rate of the fastest growing mode is a matter of practical interest since it limits the lifetime of an unstable system . as discussed in  4.2 , for the models we have considered here",

    "knowing this , we estimate here the fastest growth rate by assuming that the pole is located at @xmath253 .",
    "( we locate the singularity slightly outside the jet , since this speeds up the numerical integrations considerably . )",
    "given an assumed value of @xmath219 , we can substitute this value in equation ( [ rsing ] ) and make use of the expressions for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 given in  2.2 . recalling",

    "this is reflected in their @xmath1 profiles ( fig .",

    "however , because our equilibria both rotate and move relativistically along @xmath12 , the criterion for instability is different from the usual ks criterion ( eq . [ kscriterion ] ) .",
    "we find that the typical growth rate of the unstable kink mode in our jet models is given by equation ( [ maxgrowth ] ) : the @xmath6-folding time is of order @xmath3 times the light - crossing time @xmath311 across the jet . for convected modes with a real frequency",
    ", this translates to an @xmath6-folding length scale of order @xmath3 times the jet radius @xmath0 .",
    "since jets typically have opening angles @xmath312 , the net result is that the unstable modes grow only slowly with distance from the base of the jet ( eq . [ avsz ] ) . of course",
    ", relativistic jets in astrophysical sources propagate over many decades , so in principle even this slow growth might lead to a large amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the growth is very slow reduces the seriousness of the kink instability .",
    "our jet equilibria turn out to be close to the boundary between stability and instability according to either the ipl or tmt criterion ( eqs .",
    "[ iplcriterion ] , [ tmtcriterion ] ) , so these criteria are not useful for interpreting the results . in addition , since our models include the effects of poloidal field curvature , they lie outside the range of validity of the ipl and tmt criteria . the most useful instability criterion we have come up with is that , in the comoving frame of the jet fluid , the tangential field should be an order of magnitude or more larger than the poloidal field ( eqs .",
    "[ comov1 ] , [ comov2 ] ) . expressed thus , the criterion is similar to the ks criterion ( [ kscriterion ] ) , except that it should be applied in the comoving frame and @xmath12 should be taken to be @xmath313 .",
    "all the work described here assumes a rigid wall enclosing the jet at the boundary @xmath69 .",
    "we have done some calculations with a constant pressure boundary and we find unstable modes with much larger growth rates compared to the rigid wall case .",
    "however , since we are dealing with a force - free jet , it is not clear that a constant pressure boundary is particularly meaningful .",
    "for instance , if the pressure is from a non - relativistic gaseous envelope or cocoon , the gas would have substantial inertia and ( we suspect ) would probably behave to first approximation like a rigid wall .",
    "various authors have discussed mechanisms by which instabilities might be suppressed in astrophysical jets .",
    "* and references therein ) have shown that an external wind or cocoon can stabilize the kelvin - helmholtz mode in mhd jets , though it is not clear if this is relevant for force - free jets .",
    "@xcite show that lateral expansion causes instabilities to grow more slowly . in a sense",
    ", we have already included this effect when we derived the growth rate estimate given in equation ( [ avsz ] ) .",
    "in addition , we note that some of the growth suppression seen by @xcite is probably because expansion causes different parts of the jet to lose causal contact with one other .",
    "this is not an issue for force - free models , where signals propagate at the speed of light",
    ".    it would be interesting to simulate numerically the unstable modes described in this paper .",
    "apart from verifying the linear theory , such calculations will reveal the non - linear development of the mode .",
    "does the kink mode saturate at a finite amplitude and lead to a more - or - less coherent helical pattern or does it destroy the initial equilibrium ?",
    "this important question can be answered only with 3d simulations . since the kink mode involves lateral motion of the jet across the axis @xmath80 , the numerical technique used must be flexible enough to allow such motions ( e.g. , as described by @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude by reminding the reader that the work described here refers to a particularly simple model of relativistic jets which is based on the force - free approximation . in real jets ,",
    "once the flow crosses the fast magnetosonic point , the inertia of the gas starts to play a role and the force - free approximation is no longer valid ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this regime , we must consider the full mhd equations .",
    "the authors thank alison farmer for assistance during the early stages of this work and jonathan mckinney for numerous helpful discussions and comments on the paper .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grant nnx08ah32 g .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that in numerical simulations of force - free jets @xmath11 hardly changes with  @xmath2 . in this appendix",
    "we show that this is a common feature of all jet solutions that smoothly connect to a spinning compact object at the base .",
    "consider the force balance equation  ( [ balance ] ) .",
    "sufficiently near the compact object , where the jet is in the first acceleration regime ( see  [ eq_structure_jets ] ) , we can drop the terms proportional to @xmath314 and @xmath315 since in the first acceleration regime @xmath316 leading to @xmath317 and @xmath318 ( ) . then the force balance equation  ( [ balance ] ) simplifies to @xmath319 therefore , sufficiently near the compact object the poloidal field is nearly constant , @xmath320 each field line is labeled by the amount of poloidal magnetic flux @xmath321 that it encloses . due to  ( [ eq_bp_const ] ) this flux can be written simply as @xmath322 these relations are valid throughout the first acceleration regime .",
    "we now show that they actually hold asymptotically in all parts of the jet .",
    "recall that in force - free magnetospheres the enclosed poloidal current @xmath323 is preserved along each field line  @xcite , @xmath324 where the approximate equality is due to @xmath325 for @xmath326 ( see eq .",
    "[ gammasq ] ) . comparing ( [ eq_phi_bprsq ] ) and ( [ eq_iofphi ] ) and recalling that @xmath19 is conserved along field lines",
