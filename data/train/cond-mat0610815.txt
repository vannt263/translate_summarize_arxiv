    "the studies of _ nanosystems _ are becoming increasingly important in view of their application in quantum nanoelectronics and related fields of research .",
    "of particular importance are their quantum electronic properties , since they determine their behavior as concrete devices : quantum nanowire connectors and semiconducting elements , single - electron transistors , spin valves etc . under these circumstances",
    ", solid - state and molecular _ nanophysics _ is developing very rapidly to provide proper quantitative ( and qualitative ) characteristics of their static , transport , and optical properties @xcite . + independently of the applications , the research in _ nanophysics _ is important for its own fundamental sake .",
    "namely , the nanosystems are finite systems and therefore , most of the limiting situations considered in the condensed matter physics and involving the limit for the number of atoms @xmath1 , is simply inapplicable .",
    "furthermore , the role of boundary conditions is very nontrivial , as they should reflect the system actual configuration .",
    "also , and probably most importantly , the question of electron - electron interactions , particulary for extended states , should be taken into account on equal footing with the single - electron aspects of their quantum states , since the screening processes are very often highly ineffective . nevertheless , given the circumstances , the role of physics is to single out universal properties of the systems such as nanowires , clusters , quantum dots , etc .",
    "such research involves also determining the conditions , under which the bulk - solid concepts are applicable , since then the description can be simplified remarkably .",
    "+ in this article we present our recent and earlier results concerning the studies of nanosystems containing as an intrinsic property the electron correlation effects induced by the coulomb interactions , within the devised edabi method combining both exact diagonalization and _ ab initio _ aspects of electronic states , as well as their transport properties @xcite .",
    "this approach allows for discussing the evolution of the physical properties of e.g. nanowires or clusters , both as a function of their interatomic distance , as well as to determine the values of microscopic single - particle and interaction parameters .",
    "the visualization of the properies as a function of interatomic distance is particularly important for nanometer size systems , as they are studied customarily by placing them on a substrate with the lattice parameter , which differs from their equilibrium interatomic distance ( sometimes the substrate even stabilizes them ) .",
    "+ our most interesting results can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we show how the system properties evolve from the fermi - liquid - like to the atomic - like states for nanowires containing up to @xmath2 simple atoms , passing through the luttinger - liquid - like state , with the increasing interatomic distance @xmath3 .",
    "this evolution is determined by calculating directly the system statistical distribution function @xmath4 of electrons and their dynamical spectral function .",
    "finite - size scaling properties are introduced to determine the _ mott critical interatomic distance ( the mott criterion ) _ for the transition from the delocalized to the localized states .",
    "secondly , we show that the electronic states in nanosystems of @xmath5 atoms exhibit a magnetic splitting reminiscent of the _ slater splitting _ in antiferromagnetic metallic systems @xcite .",
    "this type of symmetry change is associated with the breakdown of the discrete translational symmetry , as the antiferromagnetism sets in . in the case of nanosystems",
    "such symmetry breakdown is not required .",
    "it turns out , that the splitting appears if the spin - spin correlation length is of the system size .",
    "the splitting should be detected e.g. in nanowires containing strongly correlated electrons in a half - filled valence band configuration .",
    "thirdly , the question arises whether with the increasing interatomic distance one should not observe the hubbard split - band structure of nanowire and molecular ( e.g. @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) clusters ?",
    "we show that nanocluster levels group into multiple hubbard subbands ( in bulk systems such a grouping is termed as homo and lumo structures ) . finally ,",
    "in the case of a quantum dot composed of e.g. @xmath0 molecule attached to the semimacroscopic electrodes we show , that the electron - hole symmetry in the tunneling transport through the molecule is not preserved and is due to the difference in electronic binding energy of @xmath8 and @xmath9 states .",
    "such result is not obtained if a parameterized model of a quantum dot properties is used @xcite . + the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section we overview the edabi method @xcite , as well as discuss some of the many - electron general properties adopted to the analysis carried out in the next sections .",
    "we also compare the method with the configuration interaction ( ci ) approach used in quantum chemistry . in section 3",
    "we discuss atomic systems and @xmath6 nanoclusters , whereas in section 4 the results for nanochains containing up to @xmath2 atoms are elaborated in detail . in section 5",
    "we employ the edabi method to calculate the tunneling conductivity through the @xmath0 molecule and the drude weight for the nanochains .",
    "we also discuss the role of boundary conditions there .",
    "+ the present method and the research grew out of our earlier work on the thermodynamics of the mott - hubbard transition in correlated systems @xcite .",
    "there , the principal question was if the metallic and magnetic insulating states can be regarded as separates phases in the thermodynamic sense ?",
    "the affirmative answer to the above question provided a partial answer to the sir nevill mott question : _ what is a metal ? _ in this article the corresponding principal question : _ how small a piece of metal can be ? _ in other words , can a nanochain composed of e.g. @xmath10 cu atoms be regarded already as a metallic system and in what sense ?",
    "the answer is yes , but above a critical value of voltage applied to the chain and for not too large interatomic distance .",
    "the second - quantization language is used when we have an interaction between the quantum physical fields representing the classical particles composing the system . the approach is usually formulated in the occupation - number representation , expressing the possible occupations of a given ( _ complete _ in quantum mechanical sense ) set of single - particle states , between which there are transitions induced by their mutual interaction .",
    "explicitly , the single - particle basis @xmath11 defines the field operator @xmath12 , in terms of which the many - particle hamiltonian ( or lagrangian ) is defined . in the nonrelativistic case ,",
    "the hamiltonian is defined as @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xmath16 represents hamiltonian for a single particle in the assembly of @xmath17 _ indistinguishable _ particles , @xmath18 is the interaction between a single pair of particles , @xmath19 is the annihilation operator of the particle in the single particle state @xmath20 .",
    "one should underline that the basis @xmath11 should be _ complete _ , but otherwise arbitrary ( it does not have to be orthogonal @xcite ) .",
    "+ the complete set of @xmath21 in ( [ foper ] ) is in practical calculations not infinite , so we have to resort to a finite subset of @xmath22 $ ] when performing explicit computations , i.e. constructing _ many - particle models_. in this manner , we make the basis _",
    "incomplete _ in the quantum - mechanical sense , even though the model may be well justified on physical grounds as it may contain principal dynamic processes involved . in the first step ,",
    "we diagonalize @xmath23 in the fock space for given trial basis @xmath24 $ ] . then",
    ", as a next step , one can optimize the finite ( _ incomplete _ ) subset taken by e.g. minimizing the ground state energy @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the ground state wave function in the fock - space representation ) , with respect to the selected subset @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "such procedure is highly nontrivial , since the determination of @xmath27 requires first the diagonalization of the parameterized hamiltonian ( [ ham2q ] ) in the fock space @xcite ( with the microscopic parameters containing both @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] ) and , only after that , setting up an _ effective wave equation _ for each @xmath29 , with @xmath30 treated as a functional of the trial basis @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the resultant renormalized or _",
    "self - adjusted wave equation _ ( swe ) should have a universal meaning to the same degree , as has the starting hamiltonian ( [ ham2q ] ) in that _ incomplete _ basis .",
    "we call this method of approach edabi ( a combined * e*xact * d*iagonalization - _ * ab * * i*nitio _ approach ) . in this manner , only then the approach to the interacting system can be regarded as _ completed _ , particularly in the situation when the interparticle interaction can not be regarded as weak , e.g. for _ correlated systems_. obviously , when the correlations are weak , the approach reduces to the hartree - fock approximation",
    ". this approach has been implemented so far to some exactly soluble models of correlated electrons and to nanochains @xcite containing up to @xmath2 atoms using as a trial basis , with adjustable slater or gaussian orbitals @xcite .",
    "here we present a rather extensive analysis of our method , applicable to both fermion and boson systems , as well as construct explicitly the multiparticle wave function is the simplest atomic situations . the last aspect of the work may be applied to both atomic and molecular systems providing e.g. a systematic approximation scheme in the quantum - chemical calculations . in particular",
    ", the explicit many - particle wave - function construction allows for a comparison with the method of multiconfigurational interaction ( mci ) approach @xcite utilized in quantum chemistry .",
    "simply put , we develop a relatively straightforward ( but not simple ! ) workable scheme , which is _ applicable to both many - electron atoms , molecules and molecular ions , as well as to clusters and nanoscopic systems . _",
    "+ one can summarize important features of our approach as follows .",
    "first , the interaction and the single particle terms in the many - particle hamiltonian are treated on an equal footing .",
    "second , the single - particle wave function appears in a nonexplicit form in the expression for the microscopic parameters and is determined explicitly from the variational principle for the ground - state energy @xmath32 , which leads to the self - adjusted wave equation @xcite .",
    "third , the explicit construction of the multiparticle wave function @xmath33 in terms of the field operators @xcite provides a way of systematizing the approximation schemes .",
    "fourth , one does not count twice the interaction , which should be taken with care in e.g. in lda+u method .",
    "all of these features are particularly important for the systems , for which the interaction can not be treated as a perturbation . among such systems are cluster and various correlated fermi and bose systems , particularly of low dimensionality .",
    "probably the most important formal feature of the present approach is that that by reversing the order of solving the problem ( treating first the interaction in the fock space and only then determining the single particle wave function in the hilbert space ) , we _ complete _ the treatment of strongly correlated systems .",
    "unfortunately , our approach is executable so far only in limited number of situations . as a side result",
    "we obtain also the values of _ microscopic parameters _ for the parametrized models @xcite . in effect",
    ", the physical properties can be analyzed as a function of interatomic distance , not only as a function of model parameters , and thus provide us with the global minimum for system at hand and for given interatomic distance .",
    "+ the _ self - adjusted wave equation _ ( swe ) , as we shall see , is of nonlocal and nonlinear nature .",
    "hence , it is very difficult to solve it directly .",
    "nonetheless , the main purpose of the present paper is to present the solution in the closed variational form and illustrate its character in simple situations , ranging from the atomic physics to nanophysics .",
    "+      we start with hamiltonian ( [ ham2q ] ) and write down in the explicit - spin basis , in which the spin is regarded as an additional coordinate , i.e. in the form @xmath34 @xmath35 we define the spin - dependent field operator as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a _",
    "complete _ single - particle basis with the set of quantum numbers denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "note that we regard the hamiltonians @xmath16 and @xmath39 as spin independent ( it is straightforward to generalize the formalism to the case with spin - dependent hamiltonian , i.e. when magnetic field or spin - orbit interaction are included ) . substituting ( [ foperspin ] ) into ( [ hamspin ] ) we obtain the usual form of the hamiltonian @xmath40 with the microscopic parameters defined by @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 in the standard form ( [ hamparam ] ) of the many - particle hamiltonian the single- and many- particle aspects of the problem are separated in the sense that the calculation of the hopping parameters@xmath44 and their interaction correspondants @xmath45 , both containing the single - particle wave - functions @xmath46 , is separated from the diagonalization procedure of the hamiltonian in the fock space @xcite .",
    "the latter procedure is dependent only on the nature of the commutation relation between the annihilation ( @xmath47 ) and creation ( @xmath48 ) operators .",
    "thus this two - step procedure can be seen explicitly when we calculate the system ground - state energy @xmath49 where the averaging @xmath50 takes place over all accessible occupancies of given single particle states @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , if we want to consider all occupancies ( a grand canonical ensemble ) , we diagonalize @xmath55 , where @xmath17 is the total number of particles and only a posteriori impose the conditions that @xmath56 , with @xmath57 + so far , the approach is standard @xcite .",
    "we have proposed @xcite to close the solution ( i.e. the complete calculation of e.g. @xmath30 ) with the determination of the single - particle basis @xmath46 by treating the expression ( [ eg ] ) as a functional of the set of functions @xmath37 and their gradients .",
    "in such situation the renormalized ( self - adjusted ) wave equation is determined from the euler equation for the functional @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath17 is the number of particles in the system , and @xmath60 are the lagrange multipliers , when the single - particle basis is nonorthonormal .",
    "+ the general form of this equation in the stationary case and in the grand canonical - ensemble formalism is @xmath61 we will make a _ fundamental _ postulate concerning this equation : _ as this equation does not contain explicitly the ( anti)commutation relations between the creation and annihilation operators , it is equally valid for both fermions and bosons and determines a rigorous , within the class of states included in the definition of @xmath62 , wave equation for a single particle wave function in the ground state , in the millieu of remaining @xmath63 particles . _ additionally , as is implicit in the treatment above , we have defined one global spin - quantization axis for all single particle states used to define @xmath64 . in some spin noncolinear systems",
    "this is insufficient and will require a more refined treatment .",
    "also , if we use the particle conserving approach to calculate @xmath30 , then we put @xmath65 in ( [ genform ] ) . likewise , for the orthonormal basis @xmath37 used to define @xmath66 in ( [ foperspin ] ) , one puts @xmath67 . in the latter case the system ( [ genform ] ) represents a set of euler equations for renormalized wannier functions . in what follows we discuss examples of application of this equation to fermion systems ( it can be applied to bose systems in the same manner ) .",
    "but first , we define the renormalized many particle wave function as complementing the above renormalized single particle states @xmath37 and then discuss the differences with the mci approach .",
    "the general n - particle state @xmath68 in the fock space can be defined through the corresponding @xmath17-particle wave function @xmath69 in the hilbert space in the following manner @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the vacuum state .",
    "one can reverse this relation and a simple algebra yields the following expression for the wave function @xmath72 in terms of @xmath68 @xmath73 in other words , to obtain the wave function in the coordinate representation , we not only annihilate n - particles from the state @xmath68 , but also project out thus obtained result onto the fock vacuum state and normalize it by the factor @xmath74 .",
    "usually , the formula ( [ npartwave ] ) is not used as we proceed from first to second quantization .",
    "now , _ the crucial point _ is based on the observation that if we substitute in the field operator @xmath75 the renormalized wave functions obtained from eq.([genform ] ) , then we should obtain the renormalized field operator and as a consequence , the renormalized multiparticle wave function @xmath76 from relation ( [ npartwave ] ) .",
    "this last step of inserting renormalized field operator completes the procedure of a formal treatment of many - particle system , which avoids writing down explicitly the n - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "the whole approach is schematically represented in fig .",
    "this scheme provides an exact renormalized single - particle wave function from eq .",
    "( [ genform ] ) and the exact @xmath17-particle wave function provided we can diagonalize the second - quantized model hamiltonian ( [ hamparam ] ) for the problem at hand .",
    "we shall see next , that we can approach the true solution also step by step .",
    "the field operator @xmath75 defined in terms of the sum over a complete basis @xmath77 contains an infinite number of single - particle states .",
    "we assume that , in general , we represent the field operator by @xmath78 wave functions @xmath79 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath80 with @xmath38 representing a complete set of quantum numbers and @xmath78 being a finite number .",
    "this approximation represents one of the most _ fundamental _ features of constructing theoretical models .",
    "the neglected states usually represent highly excited ( and thus negligible ) states of the system .",
    "we can then write the approximate n - particle wave function ( @xmath81 ) in the following manner @xmath82 recognizing that within the occupation - number space spanned on the states @xmath83 , we have the n - particle state in the fock space of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents the coefficients of the expansion to be determined from a diagonalization procedure . substituting ( [ approxstate ] ) to ( [ approxwave ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath86 @xmath87 the expression provides @xmath88 nonzero terms each equal to @xmath89 , where p represents the sign of the permutation of quantum numbers @xmath90 with respect to selected collection @xmath91 . in other words",
    ", we can write that @xmath92.\\ ] ] we have the same expansion coefficients for both wave function in the fock space @xmath68 and that in hilbert space@xmath93 !",
    "therefore , the above expression represents the multiconfigurational - interaction wave function of @xmath17 particles distributed among @xmath78 states with the corresponding weights @xmath94 for each configuration , and @xmath95 represents respectively the antisymmetrization ( slater determinant ) or the symmetrization ( simple product @xmath96 ) for the fermions and bosons , respectively . whereas mci used in quantum chemistry @xcite bases on variational optimizations of both the coefficients @xmath97 and the basis @xmath77 , here the coefficients @xmath98 are determined from diagonalization in the fock space , spanned on @xmath78 states in the hilbert space and determined from ( [ genform ] ) .",
    "the presence of swe ( [ genform ] ) thus supplements the usual mci approach .",
    "+ summarizing , the differences between the edabi and the mci methods , both of which belong to the class of multi - determinant expansion of n - particle wave function , are threefold :    1",
    ".   * historical . *",
    "mci evolved from variational methods of quantum physics and chemistry to include the electronic correlations and hence , to obtain lower value of @xmath30 by starting from many - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "edabi represents a procedure of calculating single - particle wave function starting from parameterized models of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "2 .   * technical . * in mci , we optimize simultaneously the coefficient expressing the weights of different determinants ( representing different micro - configurations ) , as well as the parameters of the trial single - particle basis . in edabi , we diagonalize the hamiltonian expressed in the fock space ( with the help of either analytic or numerical methods ) , combined with a simultaneous optimization of the orbital size in the resultant ground state .",
    "* essential .",
    "* in the case of analytically soluble models , edabi leads formally to the explicit form of the renormalized wave equation , which represents a _ nonlinear schrdinger equation of nonlocal type_. this circumstance opens up a new direction of studies in _ mathematical quantum physics_. additionally , it allows for a direct determination of dynamical correlation functions , transport properties , etc . in the convenient , second - quantization , language .",
    "usually , the choice of starting single - particle basis @xmath99 is dictated by the physics of the system at hand .",
    "since the creation and annihilation processes are characterized only by the quantum numbers @xmath38 of those starting single - particle states , one can say that they represent a _ particle language _ characterizing transitions between those states .",
    "the ground state energy obtained from the diagonalization in the fock space defines resultant single - particle states , which can be called the _ self - adjusted _ states , after the optimization of the single - particle wave function has been carried out via solving the _ self - adjusted wave equation _",
    "( swe)@xcite or its variational version .",
    "in other words , we allow the initial particle wave function @xmath100 to _ adjust _ to the correlated state .",
    "in such scheme the particle and the wave aspects of the single - particle states are intertwinned formally , illustrating among others the particle - wave complementarity , this time in a formal manner .",
    "for example , the born probability density of finding a particle is taken here as @xmath101 . in what follows",
    "we essentially illustrate the method on concrete examples and apply it to nano systems .",
    "+ one may ask _ the basic question _ : why to revert the usual sequence of solving the single - particle wave equation first , and only then constructing the field operators in the second - quantization hamiltonian ( or lagrangian ) , by solving the many - particle hamiltonian first and only then readjusting the orbitals ?",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "as said above , in many cases ( e.g. for correlated and/or low - dimensional fermionic systems ) we encounter the situation when the interaction can not be regarded as a perturbation and therefore should be treated _ at least _ on equal footing with the single - particle aspect of the problem .",
    "this is because , in general , the interaction may change the class of the stationary - state wave function .",
    "such a situation is beautifully illustrated on example of metal - insulator phase transition of the mott - hubbard type , at which the metallic state represented by the bloch - type wave functions switches to the localized ( wannier - type ) states even though those representations are regarded as equivalent from a single - particle point of view .",
    "in other words , the interaction determines the particle wave function .",
    "furthermore , the electron as a separate entity ( lepton ) is preserved even in the highly correlated milieu of other particles and therefore , constructing the self - consistent wave equation ( swe ) has a sense as it provides its wave function adjusted to the environment .",
    "+      as we have already mentioned , the selected single - particle basis @xmath102 is determined from the variational principle for @xmath103 , and it should satisfy _ the self - adjusted wave equation_. here we solve this equation variationally and take a trial basis @xmath104 dependent on a finite number of parameters @xmath105 . moreover , if the basis is orthonormal , then the equation can be simplified then to the form @xmath106 in most applications we select adjustable atomic orbitals as the basic functions @xmath107 , which need to be orthonormalized with a special kind of orthonormalization procedure .",
    "additionally , if the number of particles @xmath108 is conserved by the hamiltonian @xmath109 then the term @xmath110 in ( [ eqromek1 ] ) is absent , and the equation reduces to the ordinary energy minimization @xmath111 with respect to the variation parameters @xmath112 .      let us consider the multi - particle systems for a single - band case for atoms located at positions @xmath113 and the basic wave functions @xmath114 of the form @xmath115 .",
    "the orthonormalization procedure for periodic structures can be obtained by starting with the expression for the _ bloch _ function    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is a normalization coefficient .",
    "the normalization condition then takes form @xmath118 where @xmath119 is an overlap integral .",
    "the last sum does not depend on the relative distance , hence @xmath120 and thus @xmath121    as we can see , the above wave functions @xmath122 are the _ bloch _",
    "functions , from which we can construct the _ wannier _ functions @xmath123 in the usual manner , i.e.    @xmath124    where @xmath125    the orthonormal wannier set @xmath123 obtained with the help of the above procedure is thus a set of linear combinations of the originally non - orthonormal atomic orbitals . moreover , the coefficients @xmath126 depend only on @xmath127 and satisfy the relation @xmath128 .      the above procedure can be applied with modifications to finite cluster systems .",
    "we start from the decomposition    @xmath129    with the normalization condition in the form @xmath130 in the matrix language , this condition can be rewritten as @xmath131 or , equivalently as @xmath132 we choose the @xmath133 matrix in the form @xmath134 ; in effect this choice leads to the relation @xmath135    the above method is known as the lwdin method of determining the orthonormal basis , and for the overlap integral matrix becomes unity if elements of the system are separated from each other at large distances .",
    "so , the @xmath133 matrix then can be written down as @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "however , the above series does not converge in the tight binding approach and it has to be modified to the form @xmath138 and thus @xmath139,\\ ] ] where @xmath140 .",
    "the parameter @xmath98 allows us to manipulate convergence of the series , for it appears in the convergence condition @xmath141 that needs to be satisfied for any kind of the @xmath142 metrics .",
    "therefore , we choose the metrics @xmath143 as we can see , the metrics satisfies the condition when the parameter @xmath98 is equal to @xmath144 the method , we have just shown , can be applied to both single - band and to multiple - band systems .",
    "the method can also be applied to disordered systems . in what follows",
    "we will select as a starting atomic basis @xmath21 either slater or gaussian ( sto-3 g ) basis when constructing the wannier function , and subsequently , optimize their size in the correlated state .      in the previous section we dealt with the n - particle wave function @xmath145 . here",
    "we show how it can be applied to the evaluation of particle density @xmath146 .",
    "we start with the usual definition of the probability density for a single particle :    @xmath147    we have the particle - number conservation and hence we can rewrite ( 37 ) as @xmath148 this is because we can insert @xmath149 instead of @xmath150 .",
    "the expression for the field operator @xmath151 , defined with the help of the orthonormal basis @xmath152 in ( 4 ) , leads to the following relation    @xmath153    and thus @xmath154 therefore , we can apply the above relation to the expression for @xmath155 .",
    "namely , by noting that    @xmath156    we can obtain the following series of helpful identities : @xmath157 the expectation value of the particle - number operator @xmath158 is equal to unity for the multi - particle state @xmath159 times leads to the net result @xmath160 this result can be understood if we introduce explicitly the particle - density operator @xmath161 and thus the particle density is @xmath162    hence , we obtain the explicit expression for the density of particles using eq.(4 ) , i.e. @xmath163 or , equivalently @xmath164 where averages @xmath165 are taken with the n - particle ground state @xmath166 .",
    "the first of two terms represents the contribution of the particle - number operator to the total density of particles and appears in the _ hartree - fock _ approach as the only term .",
    "the second term can provide a significant contribution when the averages @xmath167 is of the same magnitude as the first contribution .",
    "explicitly , if the n - particle function has the form of a simple determinant @xmath168 then the occupancies @xmath169 in ( [ nodr47 ] ) an @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "this is not the case when the multi - configurational form ( [ npartwave ] ) of @xmath172 is taken , as we shall see in the following . in the remaining part of this paper",
    "we discuss the results obtained within this method of approach for various nanosystems .",
    "in this section we start with the simplest examples of lightest atoms and ions to illustrate the specific features of the edabi method , as well as to provide an elementary example of the renormalized wave equation . in particular",
    ", we systematically enrich up the trial basis to build up the fock space .",
    "we start by selecting as @xmath37 just two 1s - like states for the he atom @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the effective inverse radius of the states . in other words ,",
    "the simplest trial field operator is of the form @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the annihilation operator of particle in the state @xmath177 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the second quantization for this two - element basis has then the form @xmath178 where @xmath179 , whereas @xmath180 and @xmath181 are the matrix elements of the single - particle part defined as @xmath182 and of the coulomb interaction @xmath183 with the corresponding definitions in atomic units after the second equality sign .",
    "the only eigenvalue of ( [ hhe1s ] ) is obtained for the state @xmath184 and is @xmath185 .",
    "this total energy is then minimized with respect to @xmath174 to obtain the well - known variational estimate of both @xmath174 and the ground state energy @xmath30 , as discussed before @xcite .",
    "however , we may look at the problem differently . as the approximate field operator can be defined in an arbitrary basis",
    ", we may regard the eigenvalue @xmath186 as a functional of @xmath177 , since the functions are under the integral expressions .",
    "therefore , the true wave function is obtained from the euler equation for the functional under the proviso that the wave function is normalized .",
    "this means that we minimize the functional @xmath187 @xmath188 in effect , the euler equation take the form of he unrestricted hartree - fock equations for @xmath189 @xmath190 thus we can see that taking in the simplest case just two spin orbitals we obtain either well - known variational estimate @xcite for @xmath174 and @xmath30 for he atom : @xmath191 and @xmath192 , where @xmath193  is the 1s bohr orbit radius .",
