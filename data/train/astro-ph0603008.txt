    "the high mass x - ray binary 2s 0114 + 650 ( per x-2 ) was discovered in 1977 , and subesquently the optical donor star lsi + 65@xmath1 010 was classified as a b1 ia supergiant at a distance of 7.0 @xmath2 3.6 kpc ( reig et al .",
    "ashok et al . ( 2006 ) recently confirmed this classification through near infrared observations at the mt abu observatory .",
    "the binary orbital period of 11.6 d was determined in x - rays by corbet , finley @xmath3 peele ( 1999 ) using data from the all sky monitor ( asm ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_. they also confirmed a periodicity of @xmath02.7 h , attributing it to emission from a highly magnetised neutron star .",
    "the 2.7 h spin period is by far the slowest known for an x - ray pulsar , making 2s 0114 + 650 the first in a new class of super - slow rotators .",
    "farrell , sood @xmath3 oneill ( 2006 ) recently reported a 30.7 d super - orbital period in @xmath08.5 yr of @xmath4 asm data , making 2s 0114 + 650 the fourth x - ray binary exhibiting a stable super - orbital modulation .",
    "archived data from the _ rxte _ asm for the x - ray binaries 2s 0114 + 650 , ss433 , her x-1 , and lmc x-4 for the period mjd 50135 ( 1996 february 22 ) to mjd 53635 ( 2005 september 22 ) , were used in these analyses .",
    "we used one - day average light curves for the analysis of the orbital and super - orbital periods , and 90 s dwell data to investigate the evolution of the spin period ( farrell et al .",
    "a dynamic power spectrum approach was used for the orbital and super - orbital periods ( e.g. clarkson et al .",
    "2003 ) where the lomb - scargle periodogram was applied to overlapping light curve sections , producing a sliding ` data window ' sensitive to long - term changes in any modulation present in the light curves .",
    "we used a window length of 400 d and a shift of 100 d for the analysis of the orbital and super - orbital periods . for the 164 d super - orbital period of ss433 we used a window length of 800 d.",
    "c - band data ( 5.0 - 12.0 kev range ) were used for 2s 0114 + 650 and ss433 to account for the excessive noise observed in their low energy channels .",
    "the combined 1.5 - 12.0 kev data were used for the other sources .",
    "the resulting power spectra were normalised to the highest power in the period range of interest .",

    "the neutron star spin evolution in 2s 0114 + 650 is shown in fig .",
    "data points are shown for only when the spin period power exceeded the 99@xmath5 significance level for this low flux source .",
    "two episodes of torque reversal , each lasting @xmath0 400 d , are embedded in a general spin - up trend .",
    "2s 0114 + 650 is expected to be a wind - fed accretor , and the association of the torque reversal episodes with the formation of a transient accretion disc is unclear .",
    "the observed average @xmath6/@xmath7 based on _ rxte _ asm data is 3.4 @xmath8 10@xmath9 yr@xmath10 , a value which has been independently confirmed by bonning @xmath3 falanga ( 2005 ) using _ integral _ observations .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude less than the value expected when the spin up is caused by a disc - fed system ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "10@xmath11 gm@xmath12c@xmath13 , 2s 0114 + 650 lies far off to the right of this diagram.,width=415 ]    the change in the orbital period can not be tightly constrained by the asm data for 2s 0114 + 650 .",
    "an upper limit value for @xmath14/@xmath15 of @xmath1610@xmath9 yr@xmath10 is obtained .    to date four stable super - orbital periods",
    "have been identified in x - ray binaries : ss433 , her x-1 , lmc x-4 , and now 2s 0114 + 650 .",
    "the 164 d period in ss433 has been explained by jet precession ( margon 1984 ) .",
    "clarkson et al . ( 2003 ) showed that the stability of the 35 d and 30 d super - orbital periods in her x-1 and lmc x-4 were consistent with the radiation - driven warping of an accretion disc .",
    "they demonstrated in fig .",
    "14 of their paper that the number of stable precession solutions was dependent on the binary separation . ss433 , her x-1 and lmc x-4 all lie in the stable mode-0 precession region , while 2s 0114 + 650 lies far to the right of the mode 1 region ( fig .",
    "3 ) , indicating that two or more steady solutions are possible and that the system should precess at a combination of these warping modes . thus ,",
    "if the 30.7 d super - orbital period in 2s 0114 + 650 is due to the precession of a radiatively warped accretion disc , it should not exhibit the long - term stability that has been observed .",
    "this research made use of quick - look data provided by the @xmath4 asm team at mit and gsfc and data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research centre online service , provided by nasa / gsfc .",
