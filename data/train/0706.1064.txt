    "polarized deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering experiments revealed that the contribution of the quark spin to the proton spin is only 20 - 30% @xcite@xcite .",
    "the remaining component can be carried by the gluon spin and the angular momenta of quarks and gluons .",
    "one of the goals of the phenix experiment is to obtain the contribution of the gluon spin , namely the polarized gluon distribution function in the proton , @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 is evaluated by measuring double helicity asymmetry , @xmath1 , of reactions in longitudinally - polarized proton - proton collisions , for example , jet , @xmath2 or direct photon productions .",
    "a jet is measured as a cluster of multiple particles .",
    "the particle cluster measurement gives higher statistics at high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) than single particle measurements such as @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath1 is defined as @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number of measured particle clusters with same and opposite beam helicities , respectively ; @xmath7 is relative luminosity ; and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are beam polarizations .",
    "we used proton - proton collision data taken in 2005 at @xmath10 gev with an average beam polarization of @xmath1146% .",
    "the integrated luminosity of analyzed data is 2.2 pb@xmath12 .",
    "the phenix central arm detectors were used .",
    "two arms are positioned almost back to back , and each arm covers the pseudorapidity region @xmath13 and the 90-degree azimuthal angle .",
    "photons with @xmath14 gev/@xmath15 were measured with electromagnetic calorimeters , and an electromagnetic - shower - shape cut and an charged - track - matching veto were applied to eliminate clusters made by charged particles . charged particles with @xmath16 gev/@xmath15 were measured with drift chambers and pad chambers . for each event a high-@xmath3 ( @xmath17 gev/@xmath15 ) photon was required to exist so that the efficiency of high-@xmath3-photon trigger becomes @xmath3 independent .",
    "particles that satisfied the experimental selections were clustered by a cone method . starting from each particle in an event as a seed ,",
    "an interative procedure was used to define a cone around a cluster of particles .",
    "the cone radius @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) was set to 0.3 .",
    "the transverse momentum of the cone , @xmath20 , was defined as the vector sum of the transverse momenta of the particles in the cone ; @xmath21 the cone that gives the largest @xmath20 in an event was used in the event .",
    "the relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath22 was evaluated with pythia and geant simulations @xcite . from two hard - scattered partons in pythia jet event we selected one parton closer in @xmath18 to cone axis , and adopted @xmath3 of the parton as @xmath3 of jet .",
    "we used pythia version 6.220 with the `` rick field mpi tune a '' setting @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that the simulation reproduced the event shape , such as particle multiplicity , one - sided thrust in the phenix central arm acceptance and particle @xmath3 density , reasonably well @xcite .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty in this measurement is an uncertainty on the @xmath3 scale difference between measurement and theory .",
    "it originates in the fact that a jet is defined with cone at hadron level in measurement and at parton level in theory . in @xmath1 measurement",
    "we assigned the @xmath3 scale uncertainty 10% , by which the @xmath3 scale in theory varies when a theory cone size is changed in a typical range .",
    "we could checked the @xmath3 scale uncertainty by measuring cross section or a similar quantity because the difference in @xmath3 scale appears as a shift of cross section curve .",
    "the requirement of a high-@xmath3 photon causes a bias on the fractions of jet production subprocesses ( quark - quark , quark - gluon and gluon - gluon reactions ) .",
    "this effect was estimated using pythia . in general , the gluon - gluon reaction is suppressed particularly at low @xmath3 .",
    "no systematic uncertainty on it has been assigned because this effect is much smaller than other systematic uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : evtrate_multiparticle ] shows yield per luminosity of particle cluster with high-@xmath3 photon trigger in the phenix central arm acceptance as a function of @xmath20 . the real data is drawn as red points with systematic errors as a gray band .",
    "the main systematic errors on real data are luminosity uncertainty ( 10% ) and emcal energy scale uncertainty ( 5% ) .",
    "the predicted ones are drawn as three black lines , which are based on the nlo jet cross section with @xmath23 at @xmath24 @xcite and the @xmath22-@xmath20 relationship .",
    "the yellow band shows the deviation of the black solid line caused by a @xmath2510% @xmath3 scale variation .",
    "the difference in the yield per luminosity between the real data and the predicted one does nt exceed the deviation .",
    "figure [ fig : asym_multiparticle ] shows the @xmath1 of particle cluster production as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the predicted @xmath1 s are drawn as black lines , which are based on the nlo jet @xmath1 with @xmath23 at @xmath24 @xcite , the three @xmath0 models @xcite and the @xmath22-@xmath20 relationship .",
    "the yellow band shows the 10% @xmath3 scale uncertainty .",
