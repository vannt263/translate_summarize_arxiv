    "a gauge theory defined in more than four dimensions has many attractive features , where interactions at low energies may be truely unified and some of the distinct fields in four dimensions can be integrated as a single multiplet in higher dimensions , like in gauge - higgs models , where the higgs fields can be a component of 5-dimensional gauge fields . note also that the topology and structure of the extra - dimensional space provides new ways of breaking symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the simplest theories of this type have problems in reproducing the low energy observables , such as the weinberg angle , the sm fermion content and yukawa couplings are different from the gauge couplings  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall discuss the gauge couplings evolution for a model which contains a bulk field , gauge fields and one pair of fermions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the matter field can be introduced either as a bulk field in the representations of the unified group @xmath1 or as a boundary field localised at the fixed point where this is broken to a subgroup @xmath4 .",
    "let us call @xmath4 the subgroup of @xmath5 that is not broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar fields ( under which the vev of the scalar fields is invariant ) .",
    "we can correspondingly divide the generators of @xmath5 into two sets : the unbroken ones @xmath6 ( the electroweak gauge group ) , which annihilates the vacuum , and the broken ones @xmath7 ( the electromagnetic group ) , the orthogonal set . according to the goldstone theorem",
    "each broken generator in the coset @xmath8 is associated to an independent massless scalar ( goldstone bosons ) , carrying the same quantum numbers as the generators  @xcite : @xmath9    in the case of the bulk fields , the standard yukawa coupling can orginate only from higher - dimensional gauge couplings , but in the case of the boundary localised matter fields the standard yukawa coupling can not be directly introduced  @xcite .",
    "the gauge bosons arise from the 4-dimensional components of the 5-dimensional gauge fields , whilst the higgs field arises from the internal components of the gauge group @xmath1 compactified on an @xmath0 orbifold ; the orbifold boundary condition can be written in the following way @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the standard @xmath12 gell - mann matrices , normalised as @xmath13 .",
