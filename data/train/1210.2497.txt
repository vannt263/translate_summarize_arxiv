    "de sitter spacetime is as fundamental as minkowski spacetime .",
    "it describes the accelerated expansion of the universe sourced by the cosmological constant , or the effective vacuum energy mimicked by some scalar field .",
    "in addition to the observation that present universe is undergoing accelerated expansion , it has become a standard paradigm that the small inhomogeneity , _",
    "i.e. _ , tiny deviation from the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe , is also thought to be explained by conversion of the quantum fluctuations of light scalar fields generated during de sitter expansion in the early universe @xcite . because of this , it is important to study statistical properties of the scalar field in de sitter space .",
    "the simplest scenario for the generation of the curvature perturbation is to assume that inflaton which causes inflation simultaneously generates observed amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath5 @xcite . despite its simplicity and that its predictions are consistent with observations @xcite , this scenario is not a prediction of ( unknown ) fundamental theory but rather an assumption",
    ". actually , there are also many alternatives to this scenario most of which introduce other scalar fields which are originally isocurvature modes and convert to the curvature perturbation after inflation .",
    "the curvaton @xcite and the modulated reheating models @xcite are the representative ones that belong to this category .",
    "the scalar fields in this category are generically negligible during inflation , that is , they do not affect the dynamics of the inflationary expansion . because of this , the correlation functions among such scalar fields become invariant under the de sitter isometries . note that this is not necessarily true for the case of the inflaton fluctuation since the inflaton can affect the expansion of the universe .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study generic statistical properties of the correlation functions of scalar fields which enjoy full de sitter invariance .",
    "in particular , we are concerned with infrared limit of the correlators .",
    "this is equivalent to large distance limit or to late time limit in de sitter space since any two points that are close originally is eventually stretched to arbitrary large distance by accelerated expansion .    some literature",
    "@xcite already discuss the generic shape of the correlators consistent with de sitter invariance . in these papers ,",
    "the scalar fields appearing in the correlators are ( implicitly ) assumed to scale like @xmath6 for @xmath7 ( late time ) , where @xmath8 is the conformal time of the de sitter metric given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a constant specific to the scalar field @xmath11 and can not be constrained only by the de sitter invariance .",
    "for instance , @xmath12 etc . , where @xmath10 neither depends on the number of fields nor the type of fields appearing in the correlator under consideration but just depends on @xmath11 .",
    "this time dependence of the correlators then allows us to ( partially ) fix their dependence on the spatial coordinates by requiring that the correlators are invariant under the de sitter isometric transformations .",
    "however , it is not clear how wide class of models satisfy the above scaling .    in order to evaluate the correlation functions for the de sitter invariant state without introducing the scaling assumption a priori , we make use of the stochastic formalism .",
    "this formalism was introduced and developed in @xcite .",
    "it has been since then employed for various inflationary models to study the infrared behavior of the scalar fields ( _ e.g._,@xcite ) .",
    "the formalism has been also used to determine the distribution of the initial value of the scalar field that may become important in the late universe .",
    "this is important , for example , to provide the initial value of the quintessence field which causes the accelerated expansion of the present universe @xcite .",
    "the stochastic formalism solves the infrared dynamics by treating the long wavelength modes as the classical statistical variables that are sourced by stochastic noises coming from the short wavelength quantum modes .",
    "since the dynamics can be solved , we can fix the form of the correlation functions unlike in the literature where they are constrained only by the argument of the de sitter invariance .",
    "the stochastic formalism is especially useful when the nonperturbative effect is crucial to obtain the correct correlation functions as in the case of massless self - interacting scalar field @xcite .",
    "this is simply because infrared dynamics is solved without invoking perturbative expansion , that is , nonperturbative effect is automatically taken into account in the stochastic formalism .    despite the many existing applications of the stochastic formalism to particular inflationary models , we do not find any paper that discusses general consequences of the stochastic approach on the infrared properties of the correlators of the multiple interacting scalar fields , which motivated us to address this issue .",
    "this article is the report of the calculations of the two- , three- and four - point functions of the multiple scalar fields derived by the use of the stochastic formalism . as will be demonstrated explicitly , in addition to the scaling index of the correlators , their amplitudes , which are completely unconstrained within the framework of the symmetry argument ,",
    "can also be expressed in terms of quantities that are reasonably calculable in the stochastic approach .",
    "thus we can completely fix the ( infrared ) correlation functions .",
    "we will find that the naive universal scaling @xmath13 in the correlators does not always hold and provide the necessary condition for this scaling to hold by explicitly constructing three - point and four - point functions .",
    "our purpose is to study superhorizon evolution of ( weakly ) interacting multiple fields in de sitter space and to calculate the resulting correlation functions in the stochastic formalism . before doing this , in this section ,",
    "let us briefly review the basic points of this formalism . for more details , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the first step of the stochastic formalism is to split the field ( operator ) into the long wavelength part @xmath14 and the short wavelength part ; @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a step function and we have used a bold letter @xmath17 to make it refer to the multiple scalar fields . the second term on the right - hand side represents the contribution from short wavelength modes whose wavenumbers are greater than @xmath18 . since we are assuming that the background spacetime is de sitter one ( @xmath19 ) , any mode that originally belongs to the short wavelength part eventually enters @xmath14 .",
    "although the evolution of the short wavelength part depends on the nature of the interactions , in this paper , we assume that any interaction is negligible for the short wavelength part and @xmath20 obeys the massless klein - gordon equation in de sitter space whose solution is given by @xmath21 where the subscript @xmath22 of @xmath23 runs from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the conformal time",
    ". then we can treat @xmath27 and @xmath28 as the standard annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the second step is to consider the evolution equation for the long wavelength part @xmath14 . applying the slow - roll approximation and neglecting the higher - order terms in the short - wave modes and mode mixing terms",
    ", it reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and we have abbreviated the subscript @xmath31 for the coarse - grained field . this equation may be regarded as a classical langevin equation with a stochastic noise term , @xmath32 , which is given by time derivative of the short wavelength part and represents modes of @xmath33 that join @xmath14 at time @xmath34 .",
    "straightforward calculation shows that @xmath32 is random gaussian whose two - point function is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unnormalized sinc function .",
    "then we can easily show that the one - point probability density @xmath37 obeys the focker - planck equation : @xmath38 introducing the dimensionless potential by @xmath39 , a general solution of the above equation can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an eigenfunction of @xmath25-dimensional schrdinger equation : @xmath42 to be definite , we only consider the case the eigenfunctions are normalizable and satisfy @xmath43 the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) can be written as @xmath44 by multiplying @xmath41 to the above expression from left and integrating it by parts , the left - hand side of becomes the integral of @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 . in particular , the eigenfunction @xmath47 having the minimum eigenvalue ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath48 ) is given by @xmath49 at sufficiently late time , all the modes having the positive @xmath50 decays in eq .",
    "( [ sol - rho1 ] ) and @xmath51 becomes independent of time ; @xmath52 here we used @xmath53 which holds from the normalization @xmath54 .",
    "this is a distribution function for an equilibrium state achieved in the de sitter space .",
    "it is possible that the integral appearing in the definition of @xmath55 diverges .",
    "in such a case , eq",
    ".  ( [ sol - rho1 ] ) does not possess any static solution and hence there is no equilibrium state .",
    "this happens , for example , for massless free scalar field .",
    "the formalism explained above enables us to evaluate correlation functions between multiple fields . in the following",
    ", we will derive the infrared behaviors of the two - point , three - point and four - point functions separately by means of the stochastic formalism .",
    "derivation of the expression of the two - point functions mostly follows the one developed in @xcite , which also showed their de sitter invariance constructed from the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "the ( de sitter invariant ) spatial correlators ( on superhorizon scales ) at equal time can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the probability density of finding @xmath58 at @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath61 obeys the following equation , @xmath62+\\frac{h^3}{4\\pi^2 } \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho_3}{\\partial \\phi_a^1 \\partial \\phi_a^2 } j_0 ( \\epsilon a(t ) h|{\\vec x_1}-{\\vec x_2}| ) .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath70 and the appearance of @xmath71 reflects eq .",

    "it is hard to find the analytic solution of eq .",
    "( [ evo - rho2 ] ) with the initial condition ( [ two - eq ] ) . here",
    "we make an approximation that @xmath72 this drastically simplifies the equation without losing any essential point of the stochastic formalism .",

    "( [ evo - rho3 ] ) as we will demonstrate below .",
    "the point is to utilize the de sitter isometries which allows us to find the three - point functions at general points by implementing the coordinate transformation that preserves the de sitter metric from some extreme configuration of the points where analytic evaluation of the three - point functions ( to a very good approximation ) is feasible .    as is well known , there are 10 isometries for the metric of the de sitter spacetime . among 10 isometries , translations and rotations for",

    "we will come back to this point later when we utilize the conformal symmetry to fix the correlators .",
    "now let us consider the three - point function in the squeezed limit with different time coordinates for the different points ; @xmath121 although what we are interested in is the equal time correlators ( @xmath122 ) , for the moment , we let them to be independent due to the reason which will become clear later . to be definite , we take @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( squeezed limit ) , which is always possible without a loss of generality . for convenience ,",

    "@xmath130(this is actually @xmath131 ) are close together compared to @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , a field at @xmath132 first gets uncorrelated and starts to evolve independently when the physical distance between @xmath132 and other two points becomes equal to @xmath133 . strictly speaking",
    ", the epoch when @xmath134 occurs is different from that when @xmath135 is satisfied .",
    "but the difference between these little affects the final result in the squeezed limit and we can safely take them as being equal . at this time ,",
    "@xmath129 and @xmath130 are still deeply inside the hubble radius and fields at those two points take the same value .",
    "as the universe expands , the physical distance between @xmath129 and @xmath130 then becomes equal to @xmath133 . after this time , all the fields at different points evolve separately .",
    "this picture , which is a good approximation when there is a huge hierarchy among the lengths of the sides of the triangle , enables us to write the three - point function in the following form , @xmath136 substituting eq .",
    "( [ sol - pi ] ) , the above expression reduces to @xmath137 where @xmath138 is defined by @xmath139 and is totally symmetric under the permutation of the indices .",
    "now let us consider the late time behavior of eq .",
    "( [ squeezed-3pt ] ) .",
    "since all the eigenvalues satisfy @xmath46 , the leading contribution comes from terms with a particular set of @xmath140 having nonvanishing @xmath141 with the minimum decay rate @xmath142 .",
    "this means that each integer of @xmath140 is determined by the lowest value of the eigenvalues with the condition that @xmath141 does not vanish .",
    "note that this condition does not necessarily fix @xmath140 uniquely apart from the trivial permutations and , depending on the interactions among the scalar fields , it is possible that there are more than one set of @xmath140 . generally speaking",
    ", all the numbers can be different from each other , can be partially equal or completely coincide and concrete values of @xmath140 needs specification of the underlying model .",
    "this may be understood by considering the simplest case , _",
    "i.e. _ , single field case in which @xmath143 and @xmath144 vanish and the lowest contributions are either @xmath145 ( when @xmath146 ) or @xmath147 ( when @xmath148 ) . if the model yields @xmath149 by chance , both two contributions decay in time at the same rate and none of the two terms can be neglected even at sufficiently late time .",
    "we will come back to the single field case later .    using the equations for @xmath74 and @xmath150 given by @xmath151 we find that the three - point functions for sufficiently late time become @xmath152 where the summation indicated by `` min '' is done for all the possible sets of @xmath140 satisfying the condition mentioned above . here",
    ", we fixed @xmath90 in the same way as the case of two - point functions .",
    "this is the late time three - point functions in the squeezed limit .",
    "this form allows us to write the expressions for the general shape of the triangle formed by @xmath153 and @xmath154 by using that the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ squee ] ) is invariant under the transformation that preserves de sitter isometry . to understand this , notice that we can always move one of the point , say @xmath63 , to a vector having very long length by performing the transformation ( [ transform ] )",
    "indeed , if we choose @xmath118 as @xmath155 , then we find that the transformed point is @xmath156 , whose distance from the origin can be arbitrary large in the limit @xmath157 . by this transformation ,",
    "time coordinates , which have the same value in the original frame , take different values in the new frame .",
    "thus , equal time correlator for arbitrary configuration of points is related to the squeezed correlator with different time coordinates for different points by isometry - preserving transformation .",
    "this is the reason why only the information in the squeezed limit is enough to obtain the three - point functions for any configuration of points .",

    "( [ squee ] ) , the field @xmath11 can be interpreted as a primary field of a conformal weight @xmath159 . since it is well established how to obtain the general expression of the three - point functions of the conformal fields out of the squeezed limit @xcite , we do not expand the detailed discussion here and we only give the final result for the three - point functions which is given by @xmath160 where @xmath161 represents the physical distance between @xmath59 and @xmath162 .",
    "this equation is one of our primary result .",
    "this shows that all the information regarding the three - point functions can be obtained once we know the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the @xmath25 dimensional schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) . as a consistency check",
    ", we can verify that squeezed limit of eq .",
    "( [ 3pt - final ] ) ( @xmath163 ) gives back eq .",
    "( [ squee ] ) .",
    "also , we can implement the similar derivation of the three - point functions for the equilateral case in which @xmath164 .",
    "this case also allows the evaluation of the three - point function without resorting to the direct computation of eq .",
    "( [ evo - rho3 ] ) .",
    "it can be verified that the result coincides with the equilateral case of eq .",
    "( [ 3pt - final ] ) .",
    "now there are several points to be remarked .",
    "first , as mentioned earlier , @xmath140 is given by the condition that it is a set of integers as small as possible with nonvanishing @xmath141 . in principle",
    ", this integer set can vary for different choice of fields @xmath165 .",
    "this suggests that only a knowledge of correlators of the three product of the same field ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath166 etc . )",
    "is not enough to know the scaling behavior of the three - point function of the three different fields .",
    "furthermore , if at least one of the field appearing in the correlator is different from others , it can happen that the correlator can not be given by a single term with a power - law form .",
    "instead the correlator becomes a sum of up to six terms each of which exhibits the different power - law behavior .",
    "notice that all of those terms are not necessarily nonvanishing and it is also possible that only some of them remain nonzero .",
    "secondly , the result ( [ 3pt - final ] ) is obtained without the use of the perturbative expansion in terms of the strength of the interactions among fields . in the standard approach ,",
    "the three - point functions ( and higher order functions as well ) are calculated by using the so - called in - in formalism which usually uses perturbative expansion and truncation of the calculations at some order to yield an analytic expression .",
    "although this approach is completely justified as long as the higher - order terms contribute much less to the final result , it is known that some particular model ( for example , massless scalar field with a quartic self - interaction ) requires nonperturbative treatment to obtain the reliable correlators . in more general terms , the perturbative approach fails when the system does possess the de sitter invariant state only if the interactions are present . in such a case",
    ", the standard perturbative approach needs some care , if not impossible , to get the correct result . on the other hand ,",
    "our result ( [ 3pt - final ] ) is derived by the stochastic approach . as is well known",
    ", the stochastic approach includes the nonperturbative effects coming from the long wavelength modes . except for some simple models ,",
    "numerical computations are required to solve eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) in order to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath50 .",
    "but whichever computation method is used , the obtained @xmath50 contains the nonperturbative effect .",
    "this is also true for the amplitude of the correlator , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath141 .",
    "the point is that everything is reasonably calculable in the stochastic approach while it is hard to take into account the higher - order or nonperturbative effects in the standard perturbative expansion of the in - in formalism .",
    "therefore , our result will be quite useful when the nonperturbative effect is crucial to get the correct correlators .",
    "contrary to the case of the three - point function where consideration in the squeezed limit is enough to get the correlator for the general triangle , this is not the case for the four - point function .",
    "the reason behind this is that the transformation specified by the vector @xmath118 is not sufficient to convert any quadrangle to the one having hierarchy among all the sides of the quadrangle .",
    "thus we need to solve the evolution equation for the probability distribution function for four variables even to obtain the late time behaviour of the correlator .",
    "yet , it would be interesting to see to what extent we can restrict the form of the four - point function in analytic way .",
    ", where @xmath167 denotes the physical distance between @xmath168 and @xmath169.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us first consider the double squeezed quadrangle for which @xmath170 , where @xmath167 denotes the distance between @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for this quadrangle , using the similar reasoning we made in the case of the three - point function , the four - point function can be written as @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "interestingly , the four - point function in this limit is written solely in terms of the quantities characterizing the three - point functions . at sufficiently late time , this reduces to @xmath175 where the meaning of the `` min '' in the summation is the same as the case for the three - point function .",
    "now , the expression of the right - hand side of the above equation must be the double squeezed limit of the correlator for the general quadrangle .",
    "using again the procedure of restricting the form of the four - point function in the conformal field theory @xcite , we find that the four - point function ( [ 4pt - doublesqueeze ] ) for the general quadrangle becomes @xmath176 where @xmath177 etc . and",
    "the function @xmath179 depending on the two arguments that are invariant under the de sitter isometric transformation ( only for late time or on superhorizon scales ) is completely arbitrary function at the level of the symmetry argument .",
    "some more nontrivial information is needed to ( even partially ) fix the form of it .",
    "although we can not find analytic form of @xmath179 for the whole domain of the arguments , we can derive its asymptotic behavior or a value at specific point for some limiting cases of the arguments by considering the corresponding squeezed shape of the quadrangle .",
    "for instance , comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ 4pt - doublesqueeze ] ) and ( [ 4pt - general ] ) leads to the following asymptotic form of @xmath180 when @xmath181 as @xmath182 in a similar way , consideration of the other quadrangles with different shapes shown in fig .",

    "in this paper , we have developed a general formalism to calculate three- and four - point functions among test light scalar fields in de sitter space in the framework of the stochastic formalism .",
    "stochastic approach treats the coarse grained fields as classical variables that are affected by the random gaussian noises reflecting the effect that the short wavelength modes enter the long wavelength modes due to the accelerated expansion .",
    "we investigated behaviors of those correlators at sufficiently late time when the fields at different spatial points evolve independently and derived general formulae of the correlators . in the stochastic approach , one generally needs to solve the focker - planck equation to evaluate the time evolution of the correlator since its solution ( probability density ) appears in the definition of the correlator . this program ( with a reasonable approximation )",
    "works for the two - point functions and the result is given by eq .",
    "( [ two - point-2 ] ) .",
    "this result clearly shows that the amplitude of the two - point functions is determined by @xmath88 defined by eq .",
    "( [ def - a ] ) which represents the expectation value of @xmath11 for the @xmath194-th state @xmath195 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath50 which determines the scaling index .",
    "it is important to notice that by construction the stochastic formalism incorporates the dynamics of the long wavelength modes without expanding the basic equations in terms of the amplitude of the coarse grained fields or the strength of the interactions .",
    "therefore , once @xmath88 and @xmath50 and hence the two - point functions are obtained , they are the results that do not rely on the perturbative expansion and automatically involve the nonperturbative effects . except for some simple cases , eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) does not allow the analytic solution and numerical computation is generally required to obtain the concrete values of @xmath88 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , solving eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) is a mathematically well - defined problem and , in principle , it can be solved ( especially for the case with a small number of fields ) without any principal difficulty .",
    "this plausible feature of the stochastic formalism is in striking contrast to the standard calculation of the correlation function that usually uses perturbative expansion in terms of the strength of the interactions and truncates the expansion at some order . in most cases ,",
    "the truncation is done at the lowest order that yields nonvanishing contribution and extension to the higher order entails very messy expression that requires careful consideration to obtain physically meaningful results .",
    "direct manipulation of the evolution equation for the probability density becomes very difficult for the case of the three - point functions .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we adopted another approach which works as long as we are only interested in the late time behavior of the correlators .",
    "the basic idea is to utilize the de sitter isometries and to consider only the squeezed case in which one of the three spatial points is separated far way than the others .",
    "this limiting case allows us to build up the analytic expressions of the correlators at late time .",
    "we then converted the correlators to the ones for the arbitrary configuration of points by using the fact that the value of the correlator itself remains the same under the isometric transformation for the de sitter invariant state .",
    "among the ten de sitter isometries , the three reduces to the special conformal transformation for the spatial transformation .",
    "it is this transformation that enables us to transform any triangle into the arbitrarily squeezed one and to obtain the analytic form of the ( only late time ) three - point function for any configuration of points which is given by eq .",
    "( [ 3pt - final ] )",
    ".    now it would be interesting to consider the consequences of eq .",
    "( [ 3pt - final ] ) focusing on the single field case for simplicity . even in this case",
    ", we find nontrivial and interesting properties of the three - point function . noting that we can always make @xmath196 be zero by suitably redefining the field , the leading term that remains at late time is given by @xmath197 provided neither @xmath143 nor @xmath198 vanishes .",
    "since this combination @xmath199 provides the lowest decaying rate of the correlator , this is the only leading term that survives at late time .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ 3pt - final ] ) in this case becomes @xmath200 in this case , two - point function at late time becomes @xmath201 scaling behavior of eqs .",
    "( [ 3pt - single ] ) and ( [ 2pt - single ] ) coincide with the one given in @xcite . in these references , the scaling behavior was derived by combining the de sitter isometries like we have done in this paper and the assumption that @xmath23 ( not at the level of the correlators ) at sufficiently late time scales as @xmath202 and this scaling directly enters the scaling of the correlator , for instance , @xmath203 . on the other hand , as we have shown , the stochastic formalism can provide a necessary and sufficient condition in order for the above naive assumption to hold , which is given by @xmath204 .",
    "in addition to this , the stochastic formalism also gives amplitudes of the correlators in terms of the calculable quantities .    what happens if @xmath143 accidentally vanishes , which is possible for some models ?",
    "in this case , the leading contribution to the three - point function comes from a term @xmath205 unless it vanishes .",
    ", @xmath206 for the bound state is an odd function , so that @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ def - b ] ) vanishes . in this case , however , @xmath144 should also vanish because of the same symmetry . ]",
    "then , the two - point function is still given by eq .",

    "( [ 3pt - single ] ) on two counts ; it does not obey the single power - law , and it is not given by a single term but by three terms that are mutually related by permutations .",
    "as far as we know , this type of three - point functions has been overlooked in literature . if @xmath205 vanishes too",
    ", then we need to consider @xmath208 or @xmath209 , whichever yields the lower decaying rate .",
    "if both of these have the same decaying rate , we must keep both of them in the correlator .",
    "obviously , any of these leads to the multi - scaling expressions of the three - point function like eq .",
    "( [ b112 ] ) .",
    "these examples suggest that knowledge of the scaling behavior of the two - point function is not necessarily enough to know the scaling behavior of the three - point function . in principle , three - point function can exhibit more complicated structure than the native expectation .",
