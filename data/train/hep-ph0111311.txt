    "<S> we present a simple model where photons propagating in extra - galactic magnetic fields can oscillate into very light axions . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations may convert some of the photons departing a distant supernova into axions , making the supernova appear dimmer and hence more distant than it really is . </S>",
    "<S> averaging over different configurations of the magnetic field we find that the dimming saturates at about 1/3 of the light from the supernovae at very large redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a luminosity - distance vs.  redshift curve almost indistinguishable from that produced by the accelerating universe , if the axion mass and coupling scale are @xmath0 ev , @xmath1 gev . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath7 reveal that they are fainter than expected from the luminosity - redshift relationship in a decelerating universe  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the large scale structure and cmbr observations suggest that the universe is spatially flat , with the matter density about @xmath8 of the critical density  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore usually inferred that the universe must have become dominated by a dark energy component , which comprises about @xmath9 of the critical energy density , and has the equation of state @xmath10 , implying that our universe would be accelerating at present . </S>",
    "<S> the dark energy component could either be a small cosmological constant or a time - dependent quintessence energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neither possibility is elegant from the current vantage point of fundamental theory because of unnaturally small numbers needed to fit the data : the present value of the energy density , @xmath11 ev@xmath12 , and , in the case of quintessence , the tiny mass smaller than the current hubble parameter @xmath13 ev and sub - gravitational couplings to visible matter to satisfy fifth - force constraints  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , describing an eternally accelerating universe with future horizons is at present viewed as a conceptual challenge for string theory and more generally any theory of quantum gravity  @xcite .    because the sne observations probe length scales @xmath14 mpc which are inaccessible to any particle physics experiments , it is natural to consider alternative explanations to the supernova data without cosmological dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> a simple such alternative is that light emitted by a distant supernova encounters an obstacle en route to us and gets partially absorbed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however any mechanism must be very achromatic because the light from the sne appears to be dimmed independently of frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this would seem to rule out a medium of matter particles , which can absorb light in the optical spectrum but will re - emit it in the ir , affecting the cmbr in unacceptable ways .    in this paper we consider a model where the dimming of sne is based on flavor oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> flavor oscillations occur whenever there are several degrees of freedom whose interaction eigenstates do not coincide with the propagation eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> such particles can turn into other particles simply by evolution and evade detection . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider a model with an axion with a mass @xmath0 ev , much smaller than the usual  @xcite qcd axion mass scale , @xmath15 ev @xmath16 ev , but exponentially larger than the quintessence mass @xmath17 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this axion couples to electromagnetism through the usual term @xmath18 , which leads to energy - dependent mixing of the photon and the axion in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath19 @xcite . hence light traveling in inter - galactic magnetic fields can in part turn into axions , and evade detection on earth . a source </S>",
    "<S> would then appear fainter even if the universe is not accelerating . to satisfy other cosmological constraints </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the universe is presently dominated by some form of uniform dark energy which does not clump , but need not lead to cosmological acceleration , e.g.  with equation of state @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that contrary to the familiar example of neutrino oscillations , in our model both the flavor mixing and the oscillation length of photons in the optical range are insensitive to energy , and so our axion will induce strongly achromatic oscillations of optical photons . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the small axion mass @xmath21 insures that the photon - axion oscillations leave cmbr essentially unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> our task here is to find a small correction to the luminosity - redshift relation induced by the oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> because the sne observations at redshifts @xmath22 can be explained by a @xmath23 total increase in the distance relative to a matter dominated universe , the total attenuation of sne light should be about @xmath24 between the cosmic string - dominated geometry and flavor oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> hence we need to account for about a @xmath25 of decrease in the luminosity by the flavor oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> the axion - photon coupling is _ </S>",
    "<S> int= e b , [ coupling ] where the scale @xmath26 characterizes the strength of the axion - photon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this induces a mixing between the photon and the axion  @xcite in the presence of a background magnetic field @xmath27 ( as exists in our universe  @xcite ) . indeed , working in the coulomb gauge at distances short </S>",
    "<S> compared to the size of a coherent magnetic domain @xmath28 , we see that the photon with electric field orthogonal to @xmath27 remains unaffected by mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization whose electric field is parallel to @xmath27 mixes with the axion . </S>",
    "<S> the field equations are , after rotating the coordinate axes such that the propagation is along the @xmath29-direction , \\ { + e^2 - } = 0 [ frice ] where we fourier - transformed the fields to the energy picture @xmath30 and introduced the state - vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the photon and the axion . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 is the averaged projection of the extra - galactic magnetic field on the photon polarization @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the averaged value of @xmath27 is close to its observed upper limit , and take for the magnetic field amplitude @xmath35 g @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore its energy density is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and the hubble parameter is @xmath38 ev . the magnetic fields we will be considering are sufficiently small that we can safely ignore the euler - heisenberg effect  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now define the propagation eigenstates by diagonalizing the mixing matrix in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ frice ] ) , which is , using @xmath39 , ^2 = . [ massm ] this matrix is the analogue of the usual see - saw matrix for neutrinos , with the only difference that the off - diagonal terms are imaginary and complex - conjugates of each other . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the mixing arises from the derivative terms in the field equations rather than the potential terms . </S>",
    "<S> defining the propagation eigenstates @xmath40 and @xmath41 which diagonalize the matrix ( [ massm ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> whose eigenvalues are @xmath42 , we can solve the schr \" odinger equation ( [ frice ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions describing particles emitted by a supernova at a distance @xmath43 and propagating towards us at @xmath44 are |&= & |_-  e^-i[et + p_1 ( y - y_0 ) ] + |_+  e^-i[et + p_2 ( y - y_0 ) ]   , +    [ solns ] where @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is now clear that as the photon propagates , it mixes with the axion by an amount depending on the energy of the particle . in the limit @xmath46 , which covers all of the applications of interest to us , the mixing angle is = , [ mixang ] the photon survival probability @xmath47 is p _ </S>",
    "<S> = 1 - ^2 , [ prob ] and the oscillation length is l_o = . </S>",
    "<S> [ oscl ] in the limit @xmath48 , the mixing is maximal , while the oscillation length is completely independent of the photon energy : @xmath49 , @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus high - energy photons ( including optical frequencies @xmath51 ev as we will see ) oscillate achromatically .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in the low energy limit @xmath52 , the mixing is small , and the oscillation length is sensitive to energy : @xmath53 , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations are very dispersive , due to the energy - dependence of both the mixing angle and the oscillation length . </S>",
    "<S> but the probability to find axions @xmath55 is small , bounded from above by @xmath56 .    in our universe </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is not uniform . assuming that a typical domain size for the extra - galactic magnetic field is @xmath57 mpc @xcite , it is straightforward to numerically solve for the quantum mechanical evolution of unpolarized light in such magnetic domains with uncorrelated field directions . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic calculation shows that in the case of maximal mixing , with @xmath58 , the survival probability is monotonically decreasing : p _ </S>",
    "<S> = + e^- y / l_decay where the inverse decay length is given by l_decay=  . for @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> this reduces to l_decay=  . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that with a random magnetic field the problem becomes essentially classical and after the traversal of many magnetic domains the system is equilibrated between the two photon polarizations and the axion . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the generic prediction that on average one - third of all photons converts to axions after large traversed distances .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now estimate the axion mass and coupling needed to reproduce sn observations . to take the oscillations into account , in the luminosity - distance v.s . </S>",
    "<S> redshift formula we should replace the absolute luminosity @xmath60 by an effective one : _ eff = l  p _ . </S>",
    "<S> the optical photons must oscillate independently of their frequency . </S>",
    "<S> for them , the oscillations should reduce the flux of incoming photons by about @xmath61 for sne at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this requires @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the mass scale @xmath26 for this should be @xmath64 gev . </S>",
    "<S> note , that this is above the experimental exclusion limit for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental bound on @xmath26 quoted by the pdg  @xcite is @xmath65 gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for ultralight axions there is  @xcite a more stringent ( though also more model dependent ) limit from sn1987a given by @xmath66 gev , which is still lower than the value required here .    </S>",
    "<S> if the microwave photons had fluctuated a lot in the extra - galactic magnetic field , their anisotropy would be very large due to the variations in the magnetic field . to avoid affecting the small primordial cmbr anisotropy , @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> , the axion mass should be large enough for the mixing between microwave photons and the axion to be small . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , we can ignore the averaging over many random magnetic domains and simply treat each domain as a source of cmbr fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> the photon - axion mixing and the oscillation length in that case are given by @xmath53 , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the disturbances of cmbr are controlled by the transition probability into axions @xmath68 , which using the explicit expression for @xmath19 is p_a 410 ^ -11 . for microwave photons @xmath69 ev , and so @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore for @xmath71 ev we find @xmath72 , which is smaller than the observed temperature anisotropy . for this mass scale , </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation length of microwave photons is @xmath73 , which is of order of the coherence length of magnetic domains @xmath28 and so a lot shorter than the horizon size . </S>",
    "<S> this is harmless since the oscillation amplitude is so small . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that if the axion scales are m ~10 ^ -16 ev ,   m ~410 ^ 11 gev , [ finscale ] the mixing could produce the desired effect of reducing the flux of light from sne while leaving the primordial cmbr anisotropy unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> we stress here that while at early times the cmbr photons were much more energetic there were no sizeable extra - galactic magnetic fields yet , since their origin is likely tied to structure formation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can get a rough estimate of the influence of our effect on cmbr using their current energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> having determined the scales , we can check that the approximations we have been using are appropriate for optical and microwave photons , respectively . in the former case , the mixing angle and the oscillation length receive energy - dependent corrections @xmath74 , while in the latter case the energy - dependent corrections are @xmath75 , confirming the validity of our approximations .    to compare our model with observations , </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the constraint on the total energy density of the universe @xmath76 is satisfied because the universe contains some form of dark energy which does not clump , but it need not lead to cosmological acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> a simple example is dark energy with the equation of state @xmath77 and energy density @xmath78 , which could originate from a network of frustrated strings with small mass per unit length . </S>",
    "<S> note that because the scale factor @xmath79 of the universe obeys @xmath80 , and assuming @xmath81 and @xmath82 , then as long as the ratio @xmath83 is greater than @xmath84 the universe would presently not be accelerating . </S>",
    "<S> these forms of dark energy do not appear to be excluded either by the position of the first acoustic peak in the cmbr measurements  @xcite or by combined cmbr+large scale structure fits  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lum ] we have plotted the typical prediction of the oscillation model in a spatially flat universe with @xmath85 and @xmath78 against the best fit model for the accelerating universe with a cosmological constant ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two curves are practically indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the oscillation model predicts limited attenuation of the sn luminosities , unlike some other alternatives to the accelerating universe . </S>",
    "<S> the total attenuation is limited to about @xmath87 of the initial luminosity , as we have explained above . since for larger values of @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> the universe becomes matter dominated , and the disappearance of photons is saturated in the oscillation model , the two curves will continue lying on top of each other for higher values of @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> thus simply finding higher @xmath88 supernovae  @xcite will not distinguish between the two models . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the two is that the curve for the oscillation model is an averaged curve , with relatively large standard deviations </S>",
    "<S> . therefore it may be much easier to explain outlying events than in the case of the accelerating universe .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider photons which may pass through the magnetic field of a galaxy , or just skim it . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic magnetic fields are much stronger than the extra - galactic ones , @xmath89 </S>",
    "<S> . however , the density of baryons ( and therefore also of electrons ) is large enough in such regions that refraction has to be taken into account , which introduces a diagonal element @xmath90 for the photon in ( [ massm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a simple estimate  @xcite for this term gives @xmath91 for 10 ev photons traveling within a galaxy , while the off - diagonal terms are of the order @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this term will dominate the mixing matrix , and the oscillations will be highly suppressed while passing through the magnetic field of a galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> however , since there is no evidence for the presence of gas uniformly distributed between clusters , this effect is likely negligible for most of extra - galactic space . </S>",
    "<S> this is because a simple estimate shows , that even assuming the worst - case scenario where all matter is uniformly distributed and totally ionized , @xmath90 would be @xmath93 for @xmath94 , which would somewhat suppress the mixing . however since matter is not uniformly distributed and definitely not ionized in the inter - cluster voids ( which make up most of space ) this effect should be negligible for our results .    </S>",
    "<S> while it is natural to wonder if there are laboratory constraints on our mechanism , a simple order of magnitude estimate shows that it would be difficult to observe in a lab . since we have assumed that the extra - galactic magnetic field is @xmath95 t , for a uniform magnetic field about @xmath96 times larger the corresponding oscillation length would be @xmath97 cm , which is about a thousand times the circumference of the earth . </S>",
    "<S> the current direct experimental bounds  @xcite quoted by the pdg  @xcite on the coupling of an axion - like particle ( with a mass less than 0.03 ev ) to @xmath98 is @xmath99 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> another question is whether the oscillations may cause any observable polarization effects on the light arriving from the sne . </S>",
    "<S> if the orientation of the extra - galactic magnetic field were constant , and the field perfectly homogeneous , light from the sne would be partially plane - polarized . however , since the coherence length of the extra - galactic magnetic field is of order @xmath100 mpc , the direction of the magnetic field is effectively random , and thus no strong polarization effects are expected for faraway sne . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the converse effect of depolarizing incoming light is more important , since the oscillations in a random magnetic field may deplete existing photon beam polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> because there are distant sources which are partially polarized , with the polarization direction correlated with the shape of the source , it is important to show that the photon - axion mixing does not completely depolarize light from a polarized source . the observed polarization as a function of distance is shown in fig .  [ fig : pol ] , where we see that the polarization decrease is rather slow . </S>",
    "<S> this should be expected because the degradation of polarization occurs after an axion produced by a polarized photon conversion regenerates a photon of a different polarization , after the orientation of the @xmath27 has changed . </S>",
    "<S> this is a second - order effect , and so polarization is depleted more slowly than intensity . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the existing measurements of polarized optical photons from distant sources can be accommodated in this model .    </S>",
    "<S> an axion with the scales which are needed for our model can for example arise from the spontaneous breaking of an axial lepton number symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that it couples to the electroweak gauge theory in the standard way . </S>",
    "<S> specifically it would couple to the electromagnetic field like the qcd axion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the mass scale @xmath26 would be related to the scale of the spontaneous breaking of axial symmetry @xmath101 by m = , [ cp ] where @xmath102 is related to the gauge coupling constant , and @xmath103 is a dimensionless number depending on the precise couplings to fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we will take @xmath104 and @xmath105 in what follows for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath106 . in perturbation </S>",
    "<S> theory the shift symmetry @xmath107 protects the axion from acquiring a mass term ( more generally any potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry is broken by nonperturbative effects induced by instantons , which give rise to the axion potential  @xcite . because by assumption our axion couples to electroweak gauge fields , a possibility to generate the potential is via the electroweak instantons . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the axion potential will be of the form v(a ) = ^4 . </S>",
    "<S> [ axpot ] for example , in a particular supersymmetric ( susy ) model  @xcite , the scale @xmath108 is ^4 = e^- ^10 m^3_susy m_pl , [ lambda ] where @xmath109 is the soft susy - breaking mass scale , @xmath110 a flavor symmetry breaking parameter and @xmath111 the electroweak gauge coupling strength at the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to verify that for @xmath112 few tev , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , we get @xmath115 ev . since the axion mass is m , [ axmas ] we see that for @xmath116 gev we find @xmath0 ev . as we have seen above , these are roughly the scales most interesting for photon - axion oscillations in extra - galactic magnetic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that while our axion must be light _ </S>",
    "<S> it is not light enough _ to be quintessence . </S>",
    "<S> cosmologically , the axion particles with mass @xmath117 ev are relativistic throughout the history of the universe , and so would behave like warm dark matter . because they are weakly coupled , with @xmath118 gev@xmath119 , they are out of equilibrium from a very early time . </S>",
    "<S> if they are not significantly produced during reheating after inflation , their abundance can be harmlessly small . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the homogeneous axion background field @xmath120 will oscillate around its minimum , with its energy density scaling as cold dark matter at late times . </S>",
    "<S> thus one may worry about the cosmological moduli problem which such fields usually lead to . however in our case this does not happen because @xmath121 gev and @xmath0 ev . in the early universe , the background field will satisfy the slow roll conditions , and remain frozen until the hubble scale comes down to @xmath122 ev , when the universe cools to the temperature @xmath123 kev . at that moment </S>",
    "<S> , the field may start rolling . </S>",
    "<S> its kinetic and potential energy will rapidly virialize , after which the energy density stored in it will scale as @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial energy density is determined by the initial displacement of the axion from its minimum , which is of order @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the energy density will be of order given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lambda ] ) , @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> this would not compete with radiation until the temperature comes down to @xmath126 ev , which means that even if the axion was displaced from the minimum it would remain tiny for a long time into the future . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while an axionic sector can give rise to both domain walls and cosmic strings in the early universe , because the axion scales in the model we discuss are so low , these defects may remain negligible well into the future of our universe  @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented an alternative explanation of the observed dimming of sne at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is based on a quantum mechanical oscillation between the photon field and a hypothetical axion field in the presence of extra - galactic magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> this would result on average in about a third of the photons emitted by distant sne oscillating into axions . </S>",
    "<S> this is , roughly , the right amount needed to explain the supernova observations . if the average magnetic field is of the order @xmath127 g , and the average domain size is of order @xmath128 mpc , one would need an axion whose coupling to the photon is given by @xmath64 gev , and mass @xmath117 ev . with these parameters the luminosity - distance vs. redshift curve is almost indistinguishable from the curve of an accelerating universe with @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> since the precise value of the luminosity - distance for a particular supernova depends on the details of the inter - galactic magnetic field , we expect more variations in the observed luminosity , and thus this model may easily incorporate outlying data points . however , distinguishing this model from the accelerating universe paradigm will likely be easier through improving the bounds on the couplings of ultra - light axions , by understanding the details of the intergalactic magnetic field , or by a precise independent determination of the equation of state for the dark energy component , for example through the deep survey  @xcite . </S>"
