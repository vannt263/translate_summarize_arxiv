    "the standard econometrics education introduces the instrumental variables methods in the form of , what imbens called , the standard textbook set up,@xmath0 where @xmath1 is an outcome observation of unit @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a treatment variable of which the causal effect on the outcome is of interest , @xmath4 is a vector of observable covariates ( often called control covariates ) , and @xmath5 is an unobservable term often called as an unobserved heterogeneity of unit @xmath2 . a common way to motivate",
    "the use of instrumental variables is by invalidating the least square method due to `` the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath5 . ''",
    "this quick but somewhat less rigorous way of motivating the instrumental variables methods often creates confusions .",
    "if equation ( [ textbook ] ) were specifying a regression equation or a linear projection , then the projection residual @xmath5 is by construction uncorrelated with @xmath3 , and , accordingly , the concern about endogeneity @xmath6 would never arise .",
    "in other words , whenever instrumental variable methods are invoked , it is fundamental to understand what feature or interpretation of ( [ textbook ] ) distinguishes it from the statistical regression equation , and for what reason we should suspect the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "having a simple example would help us answer these questions . consider a classical problem of estimation of a production function .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the quantity of a homogeneous good produced and @xmath8 is the measure of labor input used ( e.g. , total hours worked by the employees ) .",
    "we do not consider control covariates for now .",
    "assume that the production technology of firm @xmath9 is given by the following function , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an unknown constant , @xmath12 is a mean zero unobserved productivity of firm @xmath2 , and @xmath13 is the parameter of interest assumed to be constant across firms .",
    "the specified production function leads to a log - linear equation , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this equation can be indeed interpreted as the causal relationship between output and input in the production process of firm @xmath2 . as in equation",
    "( 3.3 ) of the imbens article , @xmath17 can be interpreted as @xmath2 s potential outcomes at each possible input level @xmath18 . in econometrics terminology ,",
    "equation ( [ production ] ) is interpreted as a _ structural equation _ in the sense that it can generate any counterfactual outcomes of unit @xmath2 with respect to any manipulations in @xmath19 .",
    "note that the structural equation ( [ production ] ) relies only on the assumption or knowledge about the underlying causal mechanism ( production function ) and , so far , no considerations on how the data are generated have entered our discussion yet .",
    "suppose that available data of pairs of log - output and log - input of @xmath20 producers , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , are observational , meaning that the observed input level @xmath3 can be seen as a `` choice '' made by a firm  @xmath2 .",
    "following @xcite , let us model each firm s choice of @xmath23 based on the following three assumptions , ( 1 ) firms are _ rational _ , meaning that each firm chooses its input to maximize own profit , ( 2 )  the market is under _ perfect competition _ , implying that every firm treat prices of the good and input ( wage ) as given and ( 3 ) firms have complete knowledge of their production technologies @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 when they choose their input levels . under these somewhat unrealistic assumptions ,",
    "firm @xmath2 s input choice solves the following profit maximization problem : @xmath24 where @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( common ) price of the good , and @xmath27 is the hourly wage given to firm @xmath2 , which can vary over @xmath2 , that is , the wage is determined at a localized labor market . the resulting choice @xmath3 is@xmath28 .\\ ] ]",
    "if we replace @xmath19 with @xmath3 in ( [ production ] ) and notate @xmath29 , we obtain@xmath30 this equation coincides with an equation of the form ( [ textbook ] ) without covariates .",
    "equation ( [ xiobs ] ) says that a more productive ( higher @xmath12 ) firm chooses a larger labor input , implying that the endogeneity problem @xmath31 is present .",
    "accordingly , ( [ productionstructural ] ) must differ from the linear projection equation of @xmath1 onto @xmath3 , and the least squares regression of @xmath1 onto @xmath3 fails to consistently estimate @xmath13 . here",
    ", the keypoints are ( 1 ) there is a specific causal model ( [ production ] ) underlying ( [ productionstructural ] ) , and ( 2 ) the subject s optimal `` choice '' based on the unobservable ( to data analysts ) causes correlation @xmath32 .    what can be a reasonable instrumental variable in the current example",
    "? a search for an instrumental variable can also be model - based .",
    "for instance , if @xmath27 is available in data , equation ( [ xiobs ] ) says that @xmath33 should be dependent on @xmath27 , while structural equation ( production ) says @xmath27 does not directly affect the output ; accordingly , @xmath27 satisfies the instrument relevance and the instrument exclusion restriction .",
    "the validity of random assignment @xmath34 , on the other hand , would be questionable .",
    "for instance , firms located in an urban area can be more productive ( higher @xmath12 ) than those located in a rural area , and the wage level in urban area can be higher than the wage level in rural , possibly due to a higher living cost and availability of more skilled labor force . the motivation for using control covariates @xmath35 ( e.g. , a demeaned indicator of whether firm @xmath2 is located in an urban area or in a rural area ) is to cope with potential confounders of @xmath27 and @xmath12 . following the way in which imbens treats covariates ( section  6 ) , we assume conditional random assignment @xmath36 , and specify the dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath4 as @xmath37 here , @xmath5 is firm @xmath2 s unobserved productivity measured relative to conditional mean @xmath38 .",
    "note that coefficient parameter @xmath39 summarizes the dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath4 , and we are not attaching a causal interpretation to @xmath39 . plugging @xmath12 into ( [ productionstructural ] ) yields the textbook setup of the linear instrumental variable model ( [ textbook ] ) , for which the two stage least squares procedure yields a consistent estimator for @xmath40 .",
    "as is clear through this simple example , the textbook equation ( [ textbook ] ) can be seen as a _",
    "composite _ of the causal ( structural ) equation ( productionstructural ) and the statistical dependence relationship ( controls ) .",
    "the discussed paper also reviews the current debate about the meaningfulness of the complier s causal effect ( section  4.6 ) .",
    "imbens advocates the importance and practical values of reporting the complier s causal effect for the reason that it is the only causal estimand point - identified under the maintained assumptions .",
    "imbens , at the same time , acknowledges that the population average causal effect is a parameter of primary interest in many contexts of causal inference , and he recommends to report also the bounds of the population average causal effect . in my opinion ,",
    "imbens proposal is quite sensible if the main task of the data analyst is to make `` scientific reporting '' about the causal effects .",
    "the point - identified causal parameter for compliers and the set - identified causal parameter for the entire population reflect ( partially ) distinct aspects of the data distribution , and , importantly , the best we can learn from data under the maintained assumptions are only those .",
    "the objectives of causal studies are not only for `` scientific reporting , '' but also for assisting `` decision making '' of a policy maker .",
    "if the latter is a main task of the data analyst , then my personal view is that neither of the complier s causal effect estimate nor the bounds of the average causal effect should be the final output that the decision maker would find most useful . to make my argument more concrete , suppose that the decision maker s objective is to maximize the social welfare defined by the sum of individual outcomes over the target population .",
    "as in @xcite , we suppose that he / she solves the treatment choice problem based on a posterior belief for the social welfare , that is , the decision maker is bayesian . since a comparison of the social welfare between the cases with and without implementation of the treatment depends only on the population average causal effect , the posterior distribution of the average causal effect obtained from her / his carefully specified prior input leads to the decision maker s optimal choice ( see @xcite and @xcite ) for bayesian estimation of the average causal effect ) . on the other hand , point estimates and inferential statements for the complier s causal effect and the bounds for",
    "the population causal effect do not directly guide formal decision - making .",
    "the argument i just gave crucially relies on the bayesian premise that the decision maker can fully specify a prior for the potential outcomes distributions .",
    "this may not always be the case depending on a context . given the absence of a universal consensus on a `` noninformative '' prior , inability to specify a credible prior becomes a serious concern especially when the causal effect of interest is not identified , since the lack of identification makes the posterior sensitive to a choice of prior no matter how large the sample size is .",
    "one way to overcome this practical difficulty would be to follow manski s",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) frequentist approach based on the minimax and minimax regret decision principle , which relies only on the knowledge of the bounds of the population average causal effect .    the bayesian approach and manski s data - alone approach are each grounded in the two extreme schools of statistics .",
    "this means that there should certainly be a room for blending the aspects of these two approaches to complement their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "one compromising approach would be to perform a minimax or minimax - regret decision analysis with multiple priors / posteriors , namely , the @xmath41-minimax or @xmath41-minimax regret decision analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter  4 ) .",
    "for instance , in the current context , we can consider constructing a _ set of posteriors _ of average causal effects by combining a single _ posterior _ for the identifiable parameters ( causal effects for compliers , the mean of treatment outcome for always - takers , the mean of control outcome for never - takers ) with a _ collection of priors _ of the nonidentified parameters ( the mean of control outcome for always - takers and the mean of treatment outcome for never - takers ) .",
    "the collection of priors for the nonidentified parameters may represent the decision maker s partial or vague prior knowledge , or represent the degree of robustness that the decision maker wants to maintain in making the decision . here , a single prior for the identified parameters would make sense in a scenario that the decision maker feels less anxious about a prior mis - specification for the identifiable parameters since he / she knows data will well update it .",
    "if the class of priors for the nonidentified parameters is not as large as the one that allows for arbitrary ones , the resulting posterior @xmath41-minimax treatment choice rule will not be as conservative as the manski s data - alone minimax treatment choice rule based solely on the bounds . at the same time , unlike the standard bayesian analysis with a single prior distribution , it can lead to a decision - making with taking into account the posterior sensitivity concern with respect to a choice of a prior for the nonidentified parameters .",

    "<S> the modern formulation of the instrumental variable methods initiated the valuable interactions between economics and statistics literatures of causal inference and fueled new innovations of the idea . </S>",

    "<S> it is an honor to comment on professor imbens paper on instrumental variables methods . </S>",
    "<S> the discussed paper reviews both the origin of the instrumental variables methods in econometrics and their modern formulation and interpretation based on the concept of potential outcomes originating in statistics . </S>",
    "<S> a unique feature of this review article is its comparative perspective . </S>",
    "<S> imbens convinces us that `` choice versus chance in treatment assignment '' best summarizes the difference between econometrics and statistics in their traditions of identifying causal effects .    the seminal papers by angrist , imbens and rubin ( @xcite ; @xcite ) on the potential outcome - based formulation of the instrumental variables method are some of the few rare works that generated equally enormous influence on both econometrics and statistics communities . </S>",
    "<S> in the economics side , the major impacts appear in the following three aspects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the modern way of viewing an instrumental variable in relation to treatment noncompliance and an encouragement design widened the scope of applications of the method . traditionally , the uses of the instrumental variables method were restricted to observational studies , and economic theories or researcher s background knowledge on the problem were playing a unique role in validating the exogeneity and exclusion restrictions of the employed instrument . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , this new encouragement design viewpoint offers another strategy for finding an instrument in a given application , and with a randomized initial treatment assignment , researchers can validate easily and credibly the instrument exogeneity assumption without resorting to an economic theory . </S>",
    "<S> second , the concept of the local average treatment effect considerably changed the way we interpret the estimation results . </S>",
    "<S> we are no longer puzzled by obtaining contradicting estimation results across different instruments , and we treat them as separate and valuable pieces of information about heterogeneous causal effects . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , acknowledging nonidentfiability of the population average causal effect has promoted the discussion of whether the instrumental variable method should be used for the actual policy decision making and how . </S>",
    "<S> third , the discovery of the importance of instrument monotonicity assumption led us to think more carefully about the subjects causal / behavioral responses to the assigned instrument .    </S>",
    "<S> in what follows , i first illustrate by an example the link between the textbook linear instrumental variable model and the potential outcome framework to complement the discussion that imbens gave in section  6 . in the second part </S>",
    "<S> , i review the active but unsettled discussions about usefulness of estimating the local average treatment effect , and provide briefly my personal opinion on the issue . </S>"
