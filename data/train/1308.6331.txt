    "the study of frustrated quantum magnets has been a central problem in condensed matter physics over the past decades.@xcite quantum fluctuations lift accidental degeneracies of the classical ( @xmath3 ) limit , resulting in a breadth of exotic ground states and associated excitations .",
    "a characteristic example of a geometrically frustrated quantum system is the spin-1/2 triangular lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet ( tlhaf ) , which is known to order in a 120@xmath4 state in the absence of a magnetic field.@xcite a hallmark of the tlhaf s quantum character is the prediction for the stabilization of an _ up - up - down _ ( uud )",

    "experimentally , there is a dearth of results on the magnetically ordered states of tlhafs , mainly due to the difficulty of growing regular triangular - lattice materials .",
    "in fact , the only spin-1/2 system for which a @xmath1 plateau has been observed is cs@xmath7cubr@xmath8 , in which the triangular lattice is distorted , and the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is key for the details of the magnetization process.@xcite owing to the relatively weak nearest - neighbor exchange interaction , @xmath9k  @xcite , and an effective spin @xmath10 ionic ground state ,  provides a unique opportunity to study the full range of ordered phases in the tlhaf , because magnetic field strengths of approximately 30 t are sufficient to saturate the system.@xcite weak interlayer couplings make for long - range order at finite temperature.@xcite    is one of a family of transition metal oxides with the empirical formula , with @xmath11 co , cu , ni , mn , etc . in these compounds , the transition metal ions carry a magnetic moment . for example , the effective spin state is @xmath10 for co , cu,@xcite and @xmath12 for ni.@xcite the crystal structures are similar though not identical , but nevertheless magnetic frustration is common to all .",

    "for instance , the @xmath1 magnetization plateau is observed for fields 10t@xmath1915 t , associated with a uud spin structure.@xcite magnetization measurements on a single crystal sample initially reported the emergence of the uud phase for @xmath20 , thus suggesting easy - axis anisotropy.@xcite however , similar subsequent experiments , corroborated by esr data , detected a transition to the uud phase only for in - plane fields , casting doubt on the easy - axis interpretation and advocating weakly easy - plane exchange.@xcite    it has thus become clear that  can serve as an excellent , prototypical spin-1/2 tlhaf in contrast to the quantum disordered candidate systems with cu , ni magnetic ions .",
    "nevertheless , taking into account the interlayer coupling is necessary for a complete description .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy poses as an ideal technique for the investigation of this system , since it can provide a local map of the magnetically ordered states .    here , we describe results from  nmr measurements , carried out to determine the detailed spin configuration and phases at field @xmath21 t , which was oriented in the @xmath0-plane ( @xmath22 ) and along the @xmath23-axis ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "our results for the phase transition lines in the magnetic field - temperature plane agree quantitatively with previous magnetization and specific heat experiments.@xcite in addition , the nmr probe provides direct microscopic evidence for the transition to the plateau uud phase for @xmath25 in the field range 10 - 15 t .",
    "the lower field phase is identified as coplanar to the @xmath0-plane , with spin configurations in adjacent layers characterized by a reflection symmetry about the field direction . at greater fields , and beyond the uud phase ,",
    "an additional transition between two distinctive coplanar phases is detected before saturation , corresponding to the point where the magnetization is @xmath2 . in fields aligned with the @xmath23-axis ,",
    "the nmr spectra are consistent with an `` umbrella '' phase for low fields .",
    "two phase transitions are found with increasing field prior to saturation , including one at @xmath2 , while the collinear uud state is absent .",
    "for the most part , the experimental results are found to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of a semi - classical treatment that we developed for computing the quantum phase diagram of .",
    "this treatment is inspired by the work of griset _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and it incorporates the effect of quantum fluctuations via the generation of effective coupling constants for the classical spins .",
    "these constants are computed by expanding the energy of different spin configurations , which are degenerate solutions in the classical limit in @xmath26 , to leading order in @xmath27 .",
    "we begin by describing this approach and present the consequences , thus providing some context for the results of the nmr measurements .",
    "spin - orbit coupling splits the @xmath28t@xmath29 ground state of the co@xmath14 ion in a perfect octahedral ligand field into the doublet @xmath30 ( an irreducible representation @xmath31 ) , quartet @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and sextet @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) states ( @xmath36 is the total angular momentum ) .",

    "@xcite the effect of @xmath15-tensor anisotropy will be discussed at the end of the section .",
    "because the magnitudes of @xmath50 and @xmath42 are rather small relative to @xmath51 , quantum effects can be included by considering the 2d limit described by @xmath51 ( herewith , we omit the layer index @xmath39 when we refer to an arbitrary layer ) .",
