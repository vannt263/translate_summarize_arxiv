    ", pcac derives its dynamical basis in gauge theories of fermion like quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) from the ` naive ' operator relation ( or , equivalently , naive ward identity ) @xmath4 which follows from field equations , with @xmath5 the quark doublet @xmath6 and @xmath7 the isospin .",
    "one recognises in the left hand side the noether current corresponding to the chiral symmetry @xmath8 , which should be conserved at the classical level in the chiral limit @xmath9 of qcd .",
    "pcac is just the statement that the mass term on the right hand side of ( 1.1 ) can be replaced by the neutral pion field @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pion decay constant , @xmath12 the pion mass , and @xmath13 the pion field .",
    "this is an unexceptionable step since the mass term has the right quantum numbers of a neutral pion and , therefore , can be regarded as the definition of the pion field in terms of quark constituents .",
    "problem with pcac in @xmath14 stemmed from the sutherland ",

    "the abj anomaly , or in the more general context of non - abelian gauge theories of fermion , the anomaly in the u(1 ) axial vector current , arises because gauge invariance is to be preserved for consistency of the theory .",

    "such a small value requires near cancellation of two parameters @xmath200 and @xmath199 as in ( 5.6 ) , which arise from completely different sectors of the standard model .",
    "this is the strong cp problem , which is essentially a problem of fine tuning .",
    "attempts to remedy the strong cp problem by invoking a spontaneously broken global chiral u(1 ) symmetry , the peccei - quinn symmetry , have been pursued vigorously@xmath211 .",
    "the idea essentially is that the effective @xmath208 becomes a dynamical variable in this scenario involving the field of the pseudoscalar goldstone boson associated with the broken peccei - quinn symmetry .",
    "the dynamical @xmath208 could then settle down to a minimum consistent with the conservation of p and cp .",
    "the axion has been virtually ruled out by experiments and the strong cp problem in its original formulation is no closer to a resolution now than it was at the time of its conception@xmath211 .",
    "* question of global chiral anomaly * : in view of the prevailing impasse , with axion window virtually closed , it is worthwhile to reexamine critically the basic premises that lead up to the strong cp problem .",
    "the question of a nontrivial global chiral anomaly clearly stands out as the most vulnerable among these basic premises .",
    "the chiral limit of the axial vector ward identity in a instanton - like background gauge field was given in ( 3.23 ) @xmath215 where the zero modes @xmath216 are a fallout of the nontrivial winding number @xmath117 of the gauge field .",
    "it is natural to identify the right hand side of ( 3.23 ) as the density of global chiral anomaly in an instanton - like background .",
    "its space - time integral , the global chiral anomaly , vanishes by the atiyah - singer index theorem ( 3.19 ) .",
    "this patently contradicts a nontrivial jacobian as in ( 5.5 ) , the cornerstone of the strong cp problem .",
    "the popular perception of a nontrivial global chiral anomaly and hence a nontrivial jacobian ( 5.5 ) not only leads to the strong cp problem but is afflicted with contradictions in the chiral limit .",
    "the source of these afflictions is easily traced to the popular identification of the partition function with the determinant of the dirac operator @xmath70_{\\nu \\not= 0 } = \\det(i\\d + m ) \\eqno\\ldots(5.8)\\ ] ] which is unphysical in the chiral limit because of zero modes .",
    "a key to the problem is provided by the theorem@xmath217 which states that there are no wrong chirality zero modes of the dirac operator @xmath72 , i.e. , in the atiyah - singer index theorem ( 3.19 ) positive ( negative ) chirality zero modes @xmath218 are associated with positive ( negative ) winding number @xmath117 .",
    "thus @xmath219 where @xmath220 are the weyl components of the dirac operator @xmath72 @xmath221 the theorem ( 5.9 ) , therefore , assures that the partition functions defined as @xmath96_{\\nu \\geq 0 } & = \\det \\left(d_{r}d_{l } + m^{2}\\right ) \\\\",
    "z_{f}[a]_{\\nu \\leq 0 } & = \\det \\left(d_{l}d_{r } + m^{2}\\right ) \\end{array } \\eqno\\ldots(5.11)\\ ] ] in the respective gauge field sectors , are not afflicted , unlike ( 5.8 ) , with zero modes and hence have smooth chiral limits . in the trivial sector",
    "@xmath222 the two representations coincide .",
    "the representations in ( 5.11 ) require that instead of the dirac basis @xmath223 of sec.3 we use eigenfunction sets of weyl operators @xmath224 and @xmath225 appropriate respectively for positive and negative @xmath117 .",
    "thus for @xmath226 , one writes @xmath227 where @xmath228 are orthonormal eigenfunctions of the positive definite hermitian operator @xmath224 @xmath229 the set @xmath230 with @xmath231 provides a complete set of functions in the weyl basis in @xmath232 sector . in the resulting axial vector ward identity@xmath233",
    "@xmath234 the contribution from the mass term on the right hand side now vanishes smoothly in the chiral limit .",
    "the global chiral anomaly given by the space - time integral of the chiral limit of the four divergence of the axial vector current , therefore , vanishes and instead of ( 5.5 ) , we now have    @xmath235 \\\\ & = 1 \\end{array } \\eqno\\ldots(5.15)\\ ] ]    the vanishing of the global chiral anomaly means that the chiral phase @xmath199 in the quark mass in ( 5.1 ) is unphysical and can be transformed away trivially by a global chiral rotation ( 5.4 ) without affecting in any way @xmath200 .",
    "the vacuum parameter @xmath200 remains invariant .",
    "the crux of the strong cp problem , the problem of fine tuning , therefore , melts away .",
    "cp symmetry is ensured simply through the natural choice @xmath236 .",
    "ever since its conception in the context of the problem of neutral pion decay into two photons , chiral anomaly has been a topic of abiding interest and challenge in particle physics .",
    "the interest stems in a large measure from the need to couple fermions chirally to gauge fields in building models in particle physics .",
    "the challenge consists in formulating a consistent and systematic regularisation scheme in chiral gauge theories .",
    "the paper highlights and elucidates the seminal role of the mass term in the axial vector ward identity in generating the local abj anomaly and the global u(1 ) axial anomaly .",
    "gauge invariance demands that the fermion gets decoupled from the divergence of the u(1 ) axial vector current if it is very heavy .",
    "this identifies the abj anomaly with the asymptotic limit of the fermion mass term with sign reversed . on the other hand ,",
    "the chiral limit @xmath0 of the same mass term does not vanish and consists of contributions from fermion zero modes when the background gauge field has a nontrivial topology @xmath121 .",
    "the space time integral of the chiral limit cancels the integral of the abj anomaly , the ( sign  reversed ) asymptotic limit of the mass term , thanks to the atiyah - singer index theorem .",
    "this suggests , contrary to popular perception , that the jacobian for global u(1 ) chiral transformation is trivial even in an instanton background .",
    "the triviality of the jacobian is realised in a representation of the fermion partition function in the weyl basis ( 5.11 ) which has a null kernel space . the point of interest in all this is that there is no strong cp problem in an axionless physical world .",
    "current interest in lattice formulation of chiral gauge theory centres around dirac operators for lattice fermion which obey the ginsparg - wilson@xmath144 relation ( 4.4 ) .",
    "apart from redefining chiral symmetry on lattice , the ginsparg - wilson relation introduces nonlocality@xmath147 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in continuum formulation also it is possible to define a gauge invariant partition function ( 4.8 ) but only at the cost of locality .",
    "fermion averaging of the gauge current implemented with this partition function yields the covariant current .",
    "the consistent current which obeys integrability , can be generated with the covariant current as input .",
    "the covariant derivative of the consistent current thus obtained yields the minimal anomaly which obeys the wess - zumino consistency condition .",
    "both the anomalies , covariant and consistent , and the distinction between the two currents vanish if the fermion belongs to anomaly free representation ( 4.26 ) .",
