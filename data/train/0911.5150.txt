    "the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite is a well - known method of quantum many - body theory ( qmbt ) .",
    "the ccm has been applied with much success in order to study quantum magnetic systems at zero temperature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the use of computer - algebraic implementations @xcite of the ccm has been found to be very effective with respect to these spin - lattice problems .",
    "recent developments of high - order ccm formalism and codes have been to treat systems with spin quantum number of @xmath0 for both the ground and excited states @xcite . in this article",
    ", we show how these ground - state formalism and codes may also be used directly to find `` generalised '' expectation values ; that is , expectation values for a wide range of one- or two - body spin operator that are defined prior to the ccm calculation .",
    "we apply the ccm to the spin - half heisenberg model on the square and triangular lattices .",
    "the hamiltonian is specified as follows , @xmath7 where the sum on @xmath8 counts all nearest - neighbour pairs once .",

    "however , they also saw finite - size effects , indicated by cusp - like behaviour in these correlation functions , at distances given by @xmath12 .",

    "for the spin - half triangular - lattice antiferromagnet , the best estimates of the amount of classical ordering are 41@xmath9 from quantum monte carlo studies@xcite , 40@xmath9 from series expansions@xcite , 39@xmath9 from exact diagonalisations@xcite , and 40@xmath9 from previous ccm calculations@xcite .",
    "very few results for the spin - spin correlation functions of the triangular lattice seem to exist apart from results of exact diagonalisations ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the details of the practical application of high - order coupled cluster method ( ccm ) formalism to lattice quantum spin systems are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and also in the appendices to this article . however , we point out now that the ket and bra ground - state energy eigenvectors , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , of a general many - body system described by a hamiltonian @xmath15 , are given by @xmath16 furthermore , the ket and bra states are parametrized within the single - reference ccm as follows : @xmath17 one of the most important features of the ccm is that one uses a single model or reference state @xmath18 that is normalized .",
    "we note that the parametrisation of the ground state has the normalization condition for the ground - state bra and ket wave functions ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the model state is required to have the property of being a cyclic vector with respect to two well - defined abelian subalgebras of _ multi - configurational _ creation operators @xmath20 and their hermitian - adjoint destruction counterparts @xmath21 .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the appendices and to ref .",
    "@xcite for more information regarding how the ccm problem is solved for .    here",
    ", we use the classical ground state as the model state . for the square lattice , this is the nel state in which neighbouring spins are antiparallel , and , for the triangular lattice , this a nel - lke state in which neighbouring spins on three sublattices are at 120@xmath22 to each other .",
    "for the square lattice , we perform a rotation of the local axes of the up - pointing spins by 180@xmath23 about the @xmath24-axis .",
    "the transformation is described by , @xmath25 the model state now appears @xmath26 to consist of purely down - pointing spins . in terms of the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath27 the hamiltonian",
    "may be written in these local axes as , @xmath28 \\ ; , \\label{eq : newh}\\ ] ] where the sum on @xmath8 again counts all nearest - neighbour pairs once on the square lattice .",
    "again , the classical ground - state of the heisenberg model of eq .",
    "( [ heisenberg ] ) for the triangular lattice is the nel - like state where all spins on each sublattice are separately aligned ( all in the @xmath29-plane , say ) . the spins on sublattice a are oriented along the negative _ z_-axis , and spins on sublattices b and c are oriented at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , with respect to the spins on sublattice a. we again rotate the local spin axes of those spins on the different sublattices . specifically , we leave the spin axes on sublattice a unchanged , and we rotate about the @xmath24-axis the spin axes on sublattices b and c by @xmath31 and @xmath30 respectively , @xmath32 once again , the model state now appears to consist of purely down - pointing spins .",
    "we may rewrite eq .",
    "( [ heisenberg ] ) in terms of spins defined in these local quantisation axes for the triangular lattice , such that @xmath33 we note that the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) again runs over nearest - neighbour bonds , but now also with a _",
    "directionality _ indicated by @xmath34 , which goes from a to b , b to c , and c to a.",
    "the ccm formalism is exact in the limit of inclusion of all possible multi - spin cluster correlations within @xmath35 and @xmath36 , although this is usually impossible to achieve practically .",
    "hence , we generally make approximations in both @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the three most commonly employed approximation schemes previously utilised have been : ( 1 ) the sub@xmath37 scheme , in which all correlations involving only @xmath37 or fewer spins are retained , but no further restriction is made concerning their spatial separation on the lattice ; ( 2 ) the sub@xmath37-@xmath1 sub - approximation , in which all sub@xmath37 correlations spanning a range of no more than @xmath1 adjacent lattice sites are retained ; and ( 3 ) the localised lsub@xmath1 scheme , in which all multi - spin correlations over all distinct locales on the lattice defined by @xmath1 or fewer contiguous sites are retained .",
    "another important feature of the method is that the bra and ket states are not always explicitly constrained to be hermitian conjugates when we make such approximations , although the important helmann - feynman theorem is always preserved .",
    "we remark that the ccm provides results in the infinite - lattice limit @xmath38 from the outset .    in this article",
    ", we wish to determine the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath2 as a function of lattice separation @xmath4 for the ( unfrustrated ) square - lattice and ( frustrated ) triangular - lattice antiferromagnets .",
    "we must take into account the rotation of the local spin axes , although this proceeds in exactly the same manner as for the hamiltonian above .",
    "again , we remark that the manner in which high - order ccm may be solved has been discussed in ref .",
    "the manner in which the ground - state ccm ket- and bra - state equations are solved is discussed in the appendix to this article . in particular , the method by which `` generalised expectation values '' for a variety of one- and two - body spin operators may be obtained is explained in the appendices .",
    "the results for the absolute values of the spin - spin correlation functions for the ( unfrustrated ) spin - half square - lattice antiferromagnet using the lsub@xmath1 approximation with @xmath39 are shown in fig .",
    "the lsub@xmath1 results are in very good mutual agreement for small lattice separations for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , lsub@xmath1 results are clearly converging with increasing levels of approximation .",
    "furthermore , we see that lsub6 and lsub8 correspond reasonably well with each other up to @xmath40 . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( as a `` rule of thumb '' only ) , we believe lsub@xmath1 results ought to provide reasonable results to lattice separations approximately of order @xmath1 for the square lattice .",
    "ccm results are also compared to those results of exact diagonalisations ( ed ) @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . however , we see that we obtain good correspondence only for very small lattice separations @xmath41 .",
    "( we note that @xmath42 is at the current upper limit for ed of computational tractability . )",
    "however , the agreement between ed and ccm becomes rapidly worse for lattice separation @xmath43 .",
    "this disparity can be understood by considering results of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the spin - spin correlation function , which were carried out for for much larger lattices of size of @xmath6 , where @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , we find good correspondence qualitatively ( i.e. , compared by by eye only ) between the lsub8 results of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and those qmc results for the largest lattice @xmath45 of fig .",
    "3a in ref .",
    "furthermore , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite noted a strong cusp - like behaviour was seen in the spin - spin correlation function at lattice separations of @xmath12 due to finite - lattice effects .",
    "this is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the ed results at @xmath46 , although this cusp may be exacerbated by a small `` kink '' in the `` true '' spin - spin correlation function that occurs at this point anyway ( as seen in both ccm and qmc results ) .",
    "interestingly , we see from fig .",
    "3b of ref .",
    "@xcite that the accuracy of qmc results for the spin - spin correlation functions becomes more problematic ( again as a `` rule of thumb '' only ) for separations of order @xmath47 for a given lattice size @xmath48 .",
    "hence , we might also reasonably expect that results of ed might _ only _ be good for separations of @xmath49 for lattices of size @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , we note that ed agrees well with highly converged ccm results ( and incidentally qmc results of fig .",
    "3a in ref .",
    "@xcite  again comparing by eye only ) in this region .    the author of the qmc calculations in ref",
    "@xcite noted that : `` to good approximation , the two - point function depends only on @xmath4 . ''",
    "as also noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the long - range behaviour of correlation function gives a constant , thus indicating a long - range ordered ground state .",
    "we see this also at all levels of approximation as shown in fig .",
    "results @xcite for the sublattice magnetisation have shown that extrapolation of the ccm lsub@xmath1 results gives good correspondence to the results of qmc , as noted above , where both methods indicate from the sublattice magnetisation that approximately 61@xmath9 of the classical nel order remains in the quantum limit . finally , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite remarked that the approach to the constant for larger separations could be fitted by either an exponential or power - law form .",
    "we tried both for the lsub8 data with @xmath52 and found nothing to contradict this statement , although the power - law decay seemed to work better ( i.e. , had a lower residual error ) that the exponential law .",
    "the residual sum - of - squares error for the power - law form was 0.0015 and for the exponential form was 0.0034 .",
    "fits of these forms to the lsub8 data were carried out using the r statistics language : http://cran.r - project.org/.    the results for the ( frustrated ) spin - half square - lattice antiferromagnet using the lsub@xmath1 approximation with @xmath53 are shown in fig .",
    "again , lsub@xmath1 results are clearly converging with increasing levels of approximation , and again they are in very good mutual agreement for small lattice separations .",
    "ccm results are again compared to results of ed for@xmath50 ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and again good agreement is found for very small lattice separations ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "another strong cusp - like behaviour is seen in ed results for the spin - spin correlation function for @xmath55 .",
    "again , it is highly likely that this is primarily due to finite - size effects .",
    "indeed , we see that ccm results for @xmath43 are quite different to those of ed . furthermore",
    ", ccm lsub@xmath1 results initially decay strongly and then tend to a constant value for larger lattice separations .",
    "the behaviour of the correlation function for the triangular lattice is broadly similar to that of the square lattice .",
    "again , extrapolation of lsub@xmath1 results @xcite for the sublattice magnetisation demonstrate that the spin - half triangular lattice antiferromagnet is nel ordered . for lsub6 with @xmath56 , we found that the initial decay of the correlation function for ccm data in this case could be fitted well by either an exponential or power - law form ( for both forms , residual sum - of - squares : 0.0002 ) .",
    "we have presented new formalism for the ccm in order to form `` generalised '' expectation values for a wide range of terms in the spin hamiltonian .",
    "this is particularly useful for `` high - order '' ccm @xcite .",
    "we have applied this approach in order to determine the spin - spin correlation functions for frustrated and unfrustrated 2d antiferromagnets , namely , the spin - half triangular- and square - lattice heisenberg models .",
    "we found good correspondence of ccm with results of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) for the square - lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "a strong cusp - like behaviour was noted in exact diagonalisation ( ed ) results for the correlation function at a lattice separation @xmath12 for a lattice of size @xmath48 for both lattices .",
    "this is a finite - size effect .",
    "a cusp in the spin - spin correlation function was also seen in qmc results at @xmath5 for a @xmath48 lattice .    by contrast , this cusp was not seen in ccm results for either lattice at any value of @xmath11 at any level of lsub@xmath1 approximation .",
    "indeed , we note that ccm results are determined in the infinite - lattice limit ( @xmath38 ) from the outset .",
    "we believe that ( as a `` rule of thumb '' ) we obtain reasonable results for the correlation function up to separations of @xmath3 for the square lattice  even despite the fact that we are using a purely `` localised '' lsub@xmath1 approximation scheme .",
    "lsub@xmath1 results for the triangular lattice are clearly converging , and are in good mutual agreement for small lattice separations .",
    "for both lattices , ccm results for the correlation function decay strongly initially , although they become constant for larger values of @xmath11 .",
    "previous ccm results for the sublattice magnetisation @xcite indicate that the spin - half heisenberg models for the square and triangular lattices are nel ordered , which agrees with the results of other approximate methods .",
    "it is still fair to say that qmc results still generally provide the most accurate results for the unfrustrated heisenberg model on lattices of two spatial dimensions .",
    "however , qmc is severely restricted by the `` sign problem , '' which is a consequence of frustration at @xmath57 .",
    "the ccm has been shown @xcite to provides good results for the ground - state properties of the spin - half triangular lattice antiferromagnet such as the ground - state energy and sublattice magnetisation .",
    "here we have shown that the ccm also provides reasonable results for the spin - spin correlation function of the spin - half triangular lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "finally , we note that ccm results indicate that the behaviour of the correlation function for the triangular lattice is broadly similar to that of the square lattice .",
    "we thank and acknowledge joerg schulenburg for the continuing development of the cccm code ; excellent advice , help , and support over the years ; and finally for providing exact diagonalisation results quoted in this manuscript @xcite using the spinpack code ( http://www.ovgu.de/jschulen/spin/ )",
    "we begin the description of the application of the ccm by noting that it may be proven from eqs .",

    "we note that these equations are equivalent to the minimization of the expectation value of @xmath61 with respect to the ccm bra- and ket - state correlation coefficients @xmath62 .",
    "we note that eq .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) leads directly to simple form for the ground - state energy given by @xmath65 the full set @xmath66 provides a complete description of the ground state .",
    "for instance , an arbitrary operator @xmath67 will have a ground - state expectation value given as @xmath68 the similarity transform of @xmath67 is given by , @xmath69 + { 1\\over2 ! } [ [ a , s],s ] + \\cdots   \\;\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq10}\\ ] ]",
    "the manner is which the ground - state problem is solved to high - orders of approximation via computational is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , we note that use new `` high - order ccm operators '' that are formed purely of spin - raising operators with respect to the model state .",
    "the model state is taken to be a state in which all spins point in the downwards @xmath70-direction after some appropriate rotation of the local axes of the spins .",
    "this allows us to write one- and two - body spin operators in terms of these new high - order ccm operators .",
    "the problem inherent in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) becomes one of pattern - matching the fundamental set of clusters in @xmath71 to the terms in the similarity transformed version of the hamiltonian @xmath72 , where the @xmath59-th such equation is given by @xmath73 ( note that we assume that @xmath74 in the above equation ) .",
    "specific terms in the hamiltonian that may be used in the ccm code are : @xmath75 ; @xmath76 ; @xmath77 ; @xmath78 ; @xmath79 ; @xmath80 ; @xmath81 ; @xmath82 ; @xmath83 ; @xmath84 ; @xmath85 ; @xmath86 ; and , @xmath87 .",
    "we now `` pattern - match '' the @xmath88 operators to those the relevant terms in the similarity transformed version of the hamiltonian in order to form the ccm equations @xmath89 of eq .",

    "we now define the following _ new _ set of ccm bra - state correlation coefficients given by @xmath90 and @xmath91 and we assume again that @xmath92 . note that @xmath93 is the number of bravais lattice sites .",
    "note also that for a given cluster @xmath59 then @xmath94 is a symmetry factor which is dependent purely on the point - group symmetries ( and _ not _ the translational symmetries ) of the crystallographic lattice and that @xmath95 is the number of spin operators .",
    "we note that the factors @xmath94 , @xmath96 , @xmath93 , and @xmath97 never need to be explicitly determined .",
    "the ccm bra - state operator may thus be rewritten as @xmath98 such that we have a particularly simple form for @xmath99 , given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "we note that the @xmath102 is defined by @xmath103 ( and , thus , @xmath104 ) and that @xmath105 is the @xmath59-th ccm ket - state equation defined by eq .",
    "( [ templabel ] ) .",
    "the ccm ket - state equations are easily re - derived by taking the partial derivative of @xmath106 with respect to @xmath107 , where @xmath108 we now take the partial derivative of @xmath106 with respect to @xmath109 such that the bra - state equations take on a particularly simple form , given by @xmath110",
    "the expectation value of a `` generalized '' spin operator that we shall call @xmath67 may be treated in an analogous manner to that of the expectation value of the hamiltonian , given by @xmath111 .",

    "<S> recent developments of high - order ccm have been to extend existing formalism and codes to @xmath0 for both the ground and excited states . in this article , we describe how `` generalised '' expectation values for a wide range of one- and two - body spin operators may also be determined using existing the ccm code for the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we present new results for the spin - spin correlation functions of the spin - half square- and triangular - lattice antiferromagnets by using the lsub@xmath1 approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the absolute values of the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath2 converge with increasing approximation level for both lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the lsub@xmath1 approximation provides reasonable results for the correlation functions for lattice separations roughly of order @xmath3 for the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we compare qualitatively our results for the square lattice to those results of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and we see that good correspondence is observed . indeed as seen by qmc , the spin - spin correlation function initially decays strongly with @xmath4 before becoming constant for larger values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ccm results are also compared to results of exact diagonalisations for both lattices . </S>",
    "<S> ed results demonstrate a strong finite - size effects at lattice separations @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) for both lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the correlation function for the triangular lattice is qualitatively similar to that of the square lattice , namely , that it decays strongly at first before becoming constant . </S>",
    "<S> this is in keeping with the behaviour of both models , which are believed strongly to be nel - ordered from approximate studies . </S>",
    "<S> the ccm has been shown many times to provide consistently good results for the ground - state energy and sublattice magnetisation of a wide range of quantum spin models . </S>",
    "<S> here we have shown that the ccm also provides good results for the spin - spin correlation function . </S>"
