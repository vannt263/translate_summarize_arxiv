    "the quest to understand the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is a central goal of high energy physics .",
    "experiments at the fermilab tevatron and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) approach this goal by searching for a new scalar particle , the higgs boson @xmath1 , over a broad range of possible masses .",
    "electroweak precision data suggest that a standard model - like higgs boson should have a mass between 114 gev and 219 gev  @xcite , while the mass of a supersymmetric higgs boson should be less than about 140 gev .",
    "the measurement of higgs boson decays into @xmath2 is expected to provide the largest significance of any final state when @xmath3 gev @xcite .",
    "the cleanest signature for @xmath4 is two isolated opposite - sign leptons plus missing transverse energy ( @xmath5 ) from the neutrinos in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "detailed simulations of backgrounds to this channel from physics processes ( mostly continuum @xmath2 production ) and fake rates have been performed for the tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "one class of reducible backgrounds involves processes with heavy - flavor ( hf ) hadrons in the final state , where at least one lepton comes from the decay of a hf hadron ( a hadron that includes either a bottom or charm quark ) .",
    "it has been assumed that these backgrounds are removed by lepton isolation selections . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that isolation does not sufficiently suppress this background .",
    "rather , the size of the heavy - flavor background to lepton signatures is determined by details of the applied physics cuts , and current analyses do not successfully remove this background to @xmath4 .",
    "a rough estimate of the heavy - flavor background can be obtained from the probability that a muon from @xmath7 meson decay passes isolation and basic acceptance .",
    "using the pythia code @xcite to model production of central ( @xmath8 ) @xmath7 hadrons with transverse momentum @xmath9 gev , and running events through the default pgs  @xcite detector simulation , we compute an efficiency of @xmath10 for finding an isolated muon with @xmath11 gev , and @xmath12 ( the d@xmath13collaboration independently computed an efficiency of about @xmath14 in a complete detector simulation of the same process with similar cuts  @xcite ) .",
    "this efficiency is dominated by the transverse momentum spectrum of the initial @xmath7 hadrons , and the fragmentation function of @xmath15 , with isolation playing a less important role .",
    "the difference in the rates for muons before and after d@xmath13-like isolation cuts shows that isolation itself retains 1050% of all muons ( depending on the initial @xmath7 momentum ) . while an overall acceptance of @xmath16@xmath17 is small , the initial cross sections involving heavy flavors are many orders - of - magnitude larger than the predicted signal . at this level",
    ", these heavy - flavor backgrounds would swamp or at least equal the largest backgrounds considered so far .",
    "it is essential to understand quantitatively whether and how heavy - flavor backgrounds are important in the region of interest for higgs boson searches .",
    "there are two classes of heavy flavor backgrounds that contribute to the dilepton plus @xmath5 final state .",
    "the first category includes processes that contribute equally to like - sign lepton and opposite - sign lepton final states : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20-channel single - top - quark production .",
    "the second class of events is more problematic in that , up to mixing effects , it contributes only to opposite - sign lepton final states : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25-channel single - top - quark production .",
    "the @xmath21 process is especially worrisome , because an acceptance of @xmath26 would still leave a sizable background .    in this paper",
    ", we present a full simulation of the backgrounds for @xmath27 .",
    "we focus on two analyses : one by the d@xmath13collaboration  @xcite that sets a limit on the @xmath28 cross section at the tevatron , and one by the atlas collaboration  @xcite that estimates their reach at the lhc . a third analysis by the cdf collaboration  @xcite is also studied , but it produces neither a higgs boson signal nor heavy - flavor backgrounds because of extremely tight cuts .",
    "we limit our treatment of the cdf analysis to its potential for suppressing some of the backgrounds at d@xmath13  or atlas .",
    "if a cdf analysis is produced with sensitivity to the @xmath28 channel , it will encounter the same issues as d@xmath13 .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : d0analysis ] with a description of our simulation technique .",
    "we then proceed with a deconstruction of each cut applied in the d@xmath13  analysis and its effect on the heavy - flavor background .",
    "we demonstrate that the overall @xmath29 background could be as much as a factor of two larger than current estimates .",
    "we discuss the inherent weaknesses in a monte carlo estimate of the heavy - flavor background , and we emphasize the value of direct measurements of its magnitude and kinematic variation in the tevatron data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : atlasanalysis ] , we examine this background at the lhc , following the atlas analysis chain in detail .",
    "we show that the heavy - flavor background could be overwhelming with the default cuts .",
    "we propose a new , more restrictive cut that would significantly reduce the background , and we argue that the residual background can be measured _ in situ_. we conclude with a discussion of heavy - flavor lepton backgrounds in general .",
    "the d@xmath13  collaboration searched for higgs boson decay through @xmath2 into opposite - sign leptons  @xcite .",
    "we follow the complex analysis cuts because the suppression of the heavy - flavor background ( hfb ) comes not just from the isolation cuts , but from the sequence of physics cuts tuned to extract the higgs boson signal from the @xmath0 and @xmath30 backgrounds . a side effect of those cuts",
    "is to reduce the heavy - flavor background , but our goal is to understand the sensitivity at each stage .    in order to make statements regarding experimental issues , we require a detailed and believable simulation of reconstructed events . we accomplish this by running events through the pythia 6.322  @xcite showering monte carlo , and feeding the output through a version of the pgs 3.2  @xcite fast detector simulation , modified to match d@xmath13geometries , efficiencies , and detailed reconstruction procedures .",
    "the d@xmath13physics cuts are then applied to the objects found in pgs .",
    "the isolation criteria used by the d@xmath13  collaboration differ for muons and electrons @xcite .",
    "a muon is said to be isolated if there is a hit in the muon chamber , and the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks in a cone @xmath31 around a leading track is less than @xmath32 gev .",
    "the cone is defined in the plane of azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity by @xmath33 . for electrons , @xmath34 is defined to be a core cluster of transverse energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter in a cone of size @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the total transverse energy in a surrounding cone of size @xmath37 minus @xmath34 .",
    "isolated electrons satisfy the requirement @xmath38 ; and , if @xmath39 , a track must exist with @xmath40 .",
    "we apply these isolation definitions in our analysis as a modification of pgs reconstruction .",

    "the @xmath42 factors for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath43  @xcite ; @xmath43 for @xmath23  @xcite ; and we assume @xmath43 for @xmath24 .",

    "the heavy - flavor backgrounds we calculate are ultimately suppressed by at least 5 orders - of - magnitude , and a few tricks are required to obtain a significant sample of events for this study . for events with a real @xmath49 , a selection of several hundred events",
    "is chosen that pass a loose set of cuts on the hard matrix element : the transverse mass of the lepton and at least one heavy quark are greater than 8 gev , and both pseudorapidities are less than @xmath50 .",
    "each event is then processed by pythia and pgs until two isolated leptons are found for each cut level , or a maximum of @xmath51 trials is reached .",
    "this procedure provides enough events to capture the effects of isolation and physics cuts ( on phase space ) , and it retains the correlation between isolation and the missing transverse energy @xmath5 cut .",
    "simulations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are significantly more challenging .",
    "even after preselection , the cross sections change by more than 8 orders - of - magnitude .",
    "the largest loss of events is from the @xmath5 cut , since there is intrinsically little missing energy . in order to obtain any events ,",
    "the procedure is modified to require only one isolated lepton .",
    "the probability for finding the lepton at that point in phase space is then squared .",
    "cuts that depend on lepton four - vectors use the identified lepton and any observed heavy - flavor jet in the event .",
    "the direction of the jet is retained , and the lepton energy fraction is estimated based on the maximum energy that could go into pions near the lepton and still pass the isolation energy thresholds .",
    "the uncertainties of this method are qualitatively large but difficult to quantify . given the results we obtain at the end , we consider our simulation of @xmath21 a proof - of - principle that this background must be accounted for , and not a definitive prediction of its size .",
    "our final results are checked against the published d@xmath13  results for @xmath52 and continuum @xmath2  @xcite , and they agree to within 10% . the good agreement with a d@xmath13  isolation prediction @xcite , and a thorough study of the effect of variations of detector parameters and reconstruction algorithms , provide some confidence that our analysis is not very sensitive to the detector simulation .",
    "the d@xmath13  analysis quotes results for the total number of opposite - sign dileptons .",
    "we separate the background sample into separate @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 subsamples . in order to understand the effect of the analysis chain , we examine each level of cuts for the @xmath56 channel in table  [ tab : dzmucutlvl ] .",
    "there are two target cross sections to keep in mind : the @xmath57 signal is @xmath58 fb at @xmath59  1.96 tev if @xmath60 gev ; and the largest background previously estimated comes from continuum @xmath0 production .",
    "we concentrate on backgrounds that end up larger than the higgs boson signal and comparable to the continuum @xmath0 rate .",

    "nearly 1% of bottom or charm quarks has hadronized and subsequently decayed into a muon that passes all isolation criteria . at this point",

    "the cut on the leading muon in the analysis is 15 gev , but this restriction does not reduce the event rate significantly , as shown in the table .",
    "the first significant physics cut is the demand for large missing energy .",
    "this cut has little effect on @xmath67 events because there is always at least one high-@xmath68 missing neutrino . for @xmath21 or @xmath22 production , however , there is a more significant suppression of the background than even the isolation criteria .",

    "the rest of the cuts are only modestly effective since they were designed for different purposes .",
    "a cut on the scalar sum of jet-@xmath68 ( @xmath72 ) removes @xmath73 production , but the processes that concern us rarely have additional jets .",
    "the @xmath74 cut expresses the fact that spin correlations cause the charged leptons from higgs boson decays to align .",
    "this cut gains a factor of 2 reduction in the @xmath67 backgrounds , but it is not effective against @xmath21 .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath7 meson system had to be recoiling against missed radiation in order to pass the large @xmath5 cut .",
    "this effect forces the leptons to be relatively close in phase space .",
    "finally , `` interval cuts '' refer to three different cuts that are tuned to match features of @xmath28 , but do not excessively impact the heavy - flavor backgrounds here .",

    "the muon has acquired most of the hadron momentum , leaving little surrounding energy in the event on which to cut .",
    "the cut on the sum of the transverse momenta , the second line in the list above , is almost automatically satisfied by phase space considerations .",
    "its largest effect is on the @xmath23 process , where the charm spectrum is fairly soft and so many events fall below the minimum .",
    "the transverse mass cut is essentially always satisfied over the large interval allowed .",
    "we examine this distribution in detail later .",

    "we list both like - sign and opposite - sign lepton channels to demonstrate that only some of the backgrounds are symmetric .",
    "if the backgrounds were entirely driven by parton - level physics , then there would be no like - sign contribution from @xmath23 , since only @xmath78 or @xmath79 are produced , and mixing is small . however , there is some probability of tagging a jet ( especially a wide - angle pion ) as an electron , and hence there is an underlying contribution to both ls and os samples in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 samples , but not the @xmath55 sample .",

    "more electrons appear in the @xmath80 sample than the @xmath21 sample because the @xmath7 hadrons recoiling against the jet are harder than estimated by @xmath21 plus showering .",
    "hence , more electrons pass the minimum @xmath68 cut in the isolated electron definition .",
    "sometimes the additional jet is missed and helps the events pass the missing energy cut .",
    "while the additional radiation does add some sensitivity to the @xmath72 and mass - window cuts , it is not enough to observe in the table .",
    "because of the way the calculation is performed , we do not include the effect of finding one lepton from the @xmath83 decay , and one fake @xmath84 from additional jets .",
    "the results in tables [ tab : dzmucutlvl ] and [ tab : dzemu ] imply that the @xmath29 final state for a 160 gev higgs boson has an additional background of 16 events from heavy - flavor decays ( @xmath67 plus @xmath21 ) in 330 pb@xmath85 of data , compared to the combined background of @xmath86 events estimated by d@xmath13  ( dominated by 12 events from continuum @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the contribution from @xmath47 is large , but even if the @xmath21 contribution to the background is overestimated by a factor of 10 , the remaining heavy - flavor backgrounds ( from @xmath67 ) are fully half as large as the continuum @xmath0 rate .    in table",
    "[ tab : dzvmh ] , we demonstrate that the heavy - flavor background is significant in each final state ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) across the entire range of higgs boson masses studied by d@xmath13 . at this point we might be concerned that there is no apparent excess in the data .",

    "[ sec : d0newcut ] , but here we examine whether it is possible to measure the background .",
    "let us return to the two classes of backgrounds from heavy flavor decays .",
    "the first class involves processes that have a roughly equal probability of producing like - sign and opposite - sign leptons .",
    "these include @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20-channel single - top - quark production .",
    "the simplest choice to measure the backgrounds in this case is to measure the like - sign leptons and use this result as a measure of the background to opposite - sign leptons .",
    "the experimental challenge is to accurately predict small variations in efficiencies for the two final states .",
    "nevertheless , this procedure should give a reasonable estimate of the background .",
    "the second class of backgrounds is challenging to measure and , as is evident in table [ tab : dzemu ] , a larger percentage of the total background .",
    "there are several processes that contribute only to the opposite - sign final state ( up to heavy - flavor meson mixing effects and some wrong - sign charm decays ) .",
    "for a first estimate of the effect of isolation cuts , one could look at a muon triggered sample for a tagged @xmath83(@xmath89 ) .",
    "if a cut is made on missing transverse energy of @xmath9015 gev , it should be possible to observe two peaks in the muon @xmath91 spectrum of the @xmath92 sample .",
    "@xmath93 production will peak at the muon @xmath91 threshold and exhibit a long tail to larger @xmath91 , while @xmath94 will peak near 40 gev .",
    "once isolation criteria are imposed on this sample , an upper bound on the effect of isolation can be obtained .",
    "while the muon sample should be fairly clean , the electron plus @xmath83 sample may be more sensitive to fakes at lower energies .",
    "the @xmath95 sample will contain an enhanced fraction of @xmath21(@xmath22 ) , but there will be additional backgrounds from @xmath96 , top - quark production , dijets , and @xmath97 events that must be understood .",
    "it is more complicated to estimate the @xmath21 or @xmath22 processes because missing energy from escaping neutrinos can help these processes pass the @xmath5 cut .",
    "an observation of the acceptance as a function of @xmath5 may help to reduce some background and partially separate @xmath21 from @xmath98 .",
    "unfortunately , these backgrounds are always at the tails of the distributions , and this sort of study is more useful for understanding general physics properties in a detector than for measuring the background to higgs boson production .",
    "one handle on the background to higgs boson decay would be to loosen the cuts as little as possible until a more pure sample of background is obtained , and assume that the procedure can be reversed . in fig .  [ fig : dzmtll ] , we see the transverse mass distributions for @xmath28 , continuum @xmath0 , and continuum @xmath0 plus the heavy - flavor backgrounds that involve a real @xmath49 .",

    ". a reasonable measurement might be possible with a few inverse femtobarns of data .",
    "background , and the sum of all @xmath67 backgrounds with d@xmath13  analysis cuts .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 contributions are not included , but they are expected to peak around 80100 gev with unknown tails . [",
    "fig : dzmtll],width=312 ]      given the challenge of measuring the heavy - flavor background , the question arises whether it can simply be cut away .",
    "one source of inspiration could be the cdf analysis @xcite , but that method also suppresses the signal , so we settle for varying the cuts at each stage of the analysis .",
    "the first place to look would be to reexamine the isolation criteria , but it is difficult to achieve order - of - magnitude suppressions by varying isolation .",
    "our modest simulations suggest that the hf leptons passing isolation cuts fall into two categories . in the first category ,",
    "the hadron remnant is outside the d@xmath13  isolation cone @xmath100 for muons ( electrons ) and so is not counted .",
    "an increase of the isolation cone size to @xmath101 achieves only a factor of 2 reduction of the backgrounds , but it begins to eat into the good lepton sample we wish to retain .",
    "the second category is more problematic . in this case",
    ", the hadron remnant is too soft to fail the 4 gev isolation energy threshold for muons , or the @xmath102 cut for electrons .",
    "these events are more difficult to reject , because the thresholds can not be lowered by much before sensitivity to the underlying event or minimum ionizing radiation ( for muons ) increases . more importantly ,",
    "these events come from the portion of phase space where the lepton takes most of the visible hadron momentum .",
    "even the impact parameter is small .    a better method of cutting the background is to look at the transverse energy @xmath103 spectra of the leptons . in figs .",
    "[ fig : dzetlo ] and [ fig : dzetlt ] , we see the @xmath103 of reconstructed leptons for @xmath28 , continuum @xmath0 , @xmath23 , and @xmath21 .",
    "an increase of the cut on the leading lepton from 15 gev to 20 gev is useful , but not as beneficial as it might seem , because the @xmath23 leptons peak above 20 gev , and even the leading lepton from @xmath21 is not falling very fast .",
    "however , the spectrum of the next - to - leading lepton in fig .",
    "[ fig : dzetlt ] is falling exponentially , whereas the higgs boson and continuum @xmath0 spectra are almost flat up to 40 gev .",
    "an increase of the cut on the next - to - leading lepton close to that of the leading lepton ( e.g. , make both 20 gev ) virtually removes the @xmath23 and @xmath104 backgrounds , with a modest reduction of the signal .",
    "of course this increase provides no help against the original continuum @xmath0 background .    analysis cuts .",
    "[ fig : dzetlo],width=312 ]    analysis cuts .",
    "[ fig : dzetlt],width=312 ]    while it appears that there is a way to effectively remove the background from heavy - flavor leptons for the @xmath28 search at the tevatron , it is not obvious that it is desirable",
    ". given the poor signal to background ratio of about @xmath105 before the addition of the hf backgrounds , we would recommend that more effort be placed on understanding how to extract the hf background from the data .",
    "that understanding could then be fed into other multilepton analyses and lay the foundation for studies at the lhc .",
    "the higgs boson is expected to be discovered with a large significance at the lhc  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we examine the signal and backgrounds for @xmath106 in the atlas detector , emphasizing the contribution from leptons that arise from semileptonic decays of heavy flavors .",
    "the simulation procedure is the same as that used for the d@xmath13  analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : d0analysis ] .",
    "the detector simulation is a heavily modified version of pgs  @xcite that reproduces the results of the relevant full atlas detector simulations to within 10%  @xcite .",
    "this code has a more accurate treatment of geometric effects and efficiencies than atlfast .",
    "one surprise is that effective @xmath42 factors _ after cuts _ are uniformly smaller at the lhc than at the tevatron . using mcfm 4.1  @xcite and ztop 1.0  @xcite , we find the @xmath42 factor for @xmath28 is only @xmath107 ( compared to @xmath108 at the tevatron ) ; @xmath109 for @xmath20-channel single - top - quark production ; and all other @xmath42 factors are approximately @xmath110 .",
    "the net effect is that only the higgs boson signal is ( slightly ) enhanced at nlo .",
    "there are two caveats that must be noted .",
    "first , the lepton identification and isolation cuts will likely change when data are accumulated and detector response is measured .",
    "the large inherent uncertainties in the simulation procedure will not be improved until the detectors are operating . nevertheless , the results are dominated by detector - independent physics and should be fairly accurate relative to other physics processes .",
    "the second caveat is that we are able to calculate only a _",
    "lower _ bound on the @xmath21 background , and we do not include the @xmath22 background .",
    "the reason is that the atlas study imposes extremely tight cuts on the phase space of the leptons that are passed only if strong preselections are made on the events .",

    "since isolation criteria are not finalized , this seems a logical place to start .",

    "the size of the underlying event and measured shower shapes may require raising or lowering of thresholds for allowed radiation .",
    "lowering the thresholds by a factor of two has little effect on electron isolation , and only a factor of 2 reduction in the background for muons . raising the isolation thresholds by 50% ( a typical high - luminosity scenario  @xcite ) still has little effect on the electrons , but increases the muon background by a factor of 2 per muon ( so the contributions from @xmath21 and @xmath22 increase by a factor of 4 ) .",
    "a change of the missing energy cut by @xmath140 gev has little effect on the overall significance .",
    "however , the signal begins to decrease significantly once the @xmath5 increases above 50 gev .",
    "the jet veto threshold is expected to be raised to 40 gev for high luminosity operation . at a higher threshold , the higgs boson signal increases by about 25% , while the background increases by no more than 50% .",
    "it may be advisable to relax the jet veto threshold to 40 gev to reduce sensitivity to the underlying event , and improve the significance during low luminosity operation . finally , it is notable that the tight @xmath141 cut reduces the signal by almost a factor of 2",
    ". it may be desirable to relax this cut to the d@xmath13  choice @xmath142 to improve the event rate .",
    "none of these other cuts has nearly the impact of an increase in the @xmath68 threshold.of the next - to - leading lepton .",
    "in this paper we perform a full monte carlo simulation of the background for higgs boson decay to dilepton plus missing energy that arises from leptonic decays of heavy flavors .",
    "the processes that produce these backgrounds typically begin @xmath143@xmath144 times as large as the signals of interest . contrary to popular lore ,",
    "these backgrounds are only mildly suppressed by isolation cuts .",
    "instead , it is the detailed sequence of cuts on the phase space of the events that suppresses their size .    throughout this paper",
    "we compare the heavy - flavor background ( hfb ) to the largest previously calculated background , continuum @xmath2 production . for events with one heavy - flavor lepton ( @xmath23 , @xmath18 , @xmath145 )",
    ", the analysis cuts tend to chip away at the heavy - flavor backgrounds .",
    "the net result is an additional background that is half as large as continuum @xmath0 at the tevatron , but potentially @xmath146 times larger than @xmath0 at the lhc . for events with two heavy - flavor leptons ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) ,",
    "the additional background estimate is less certain , but it is potentially even larger .",
    "spin correlations in the @xmath4 signal tend to cause the leptons to be fairly soft , hence the @xmath68 cut on the next - to - leading lepton is pushed as low as possible  10 gev in the cases of both d@xmath13  and atlas .",
    "we demonstrate that simply raising the cut on this additional lepton to @xmath14720 gev preserves roughly @xmath135 of the signal , but it reduces these background by factors of 1030 .",
    "raising the @xmath68 cut is very effective for removing the hfb , but we emphasize that extrapolations of the magnitude and shape of this background using monte carlo techniques have large inherent uncertainties . in particular , there is a strong correlation between the cut on missing transverse energy @xmath5 and isolation . we recommend that the hf background be measured _ in situ _ , with cuts as close as possible to the final sample .",
    "we describe a preliminary technique that could be used at the tevatron . at the lhc",
    "the hfb is large enough that it can be studied in the final transverse mass @xmath99 distribution and fully controlled .",
    "while this paper focuses in detail on analyses of @xmath4 , our intention is to raise a broader awareness of the potential danger of heavy - flavor leptons to multilepton analyses .",
    "vector - boson fusion into a higgs boson is similar to the process studied here , with the added requirement of two hard jets at large and opposite rapidities .",
    "the jet requirement may _ increase _ the backgrounds from @xmath21 and @xmath22 , because these processes naturally come with additional radiation .",
    "other higgs boson decay modes may also be effected , e.g. , @xmath148 leptons has a background from @xmath149 .",
    "even trilepton searches for supersymmetry typically have very soft additional leptons .",
    "if lepton transverse momentum cuts must be raised to remove the heavy - flavor leptons , there could be a far - ranging impact on analyses of these types of signals .",
