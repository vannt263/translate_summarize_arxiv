    "photometry of rich clusters of galaxies at high redshift remains one of the most important tools to understand the evolution of galaxy populations in dense environments .",
    "the discovery of a large fraction of blue galaxies in rich clusters has been understood as evidence for a strong , recent evolution of galaxies in clusters ( butcher & oemler 1984 , hereafter bo ; sharples et al .",
    "the interpretation of this blue excess is a difficult challenge because the galaxy content varies from cluster to cluster .",
    "dressler et al .  ( 1985 ) suggested that it can arise from several reasons : different initial conditions , a difference in the time scales for cluster formation and/or environmental influences .",
    "the presence of luminosity and color segregation in nearby clusters ( capelato et al .  1980 ) as well as in high redshift clusters ( mellier et al .  1988 ) is often interpreted in terms of dynamic friction and environmental influence ( galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - icm interactions ) . nevertheless , it is not still clear to what extent these properties are innate or the result of later evolutionary processes .",
    "dressler & gunn ( 1992 ) published a paper on the photometry and spectroscopy of seven clusters in the redshift range @xmath2 , including a thorough discussion on the statistical properties of the sample .",
    "such studies are crucial to an understanding of the evolutionary processes that take place in clusters .",
    "recently , dressler et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) and coutch et al .",
    "( 1994 ) studied the morphology of the blue galaxies in clusters at @xmath3 , using hst images .",
    "they found that the blue objects are predominantly disk - dominated or irregular galaxies , involved in merger or interaction processes .",
    "thus , it is important to enlarge the sample of well known high and medium redshift clusters , and photometry allows to study a larger sample of galaxies than spectroscopy .",
    "cl  1613 + 3104 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) is a mid - redshift rich cluster , which exhibits x - ray ( henry et al .  1982 ) and",
    "radio emission ( jaffe 1982 ) .",
    "its redshift ( @xmath9 ) was obtained by sandage et al .",
    "( 1976 ) from the spectrum of the first - ranked galaxy .",
    "gmez et al .  (",
    "1994 ) reported the existence of a diffuse light extending up to 265 h@xmath10 kpc from its center , associated with a stellar component immersed in the gravitational potential of the cluster .",
    "cl  1600 + 4109 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) is another mid - redshift cluster ( @xmath15 ; henry et al .  1982 ) included in the sample of gunn et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , whose population of galaxies has not been studied to date .",
    "it is not a strong x - ray emitter : its upper limit for the x - ray emission is @xmath16  erg  s@xmath10 in the 0.54.5  kev range ( henry et al .  1982 ) .",
    "the database used here comes from the photometric survey by pell & vlchez  gmez ( 1996 ) , hereafter referred as paper i.    the layout of this paper is the following .",
    "a summary of the observational procedure is presented in sect .  2 .",
    "section 3 reviews the methods used in the analysis of the photometric catalogs and the results obtained are given in sects .  4 and 5 .",
    "in sect .",
    "6 we discuss these results and we present the conclusions of this work .",
    "we assume @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a standard friedmann cosmology .",
    "the observations reported here were carried out in two different runs ( in may 1987 and july 1988 ) at the f/3.4 prime focus of the 3.5  m telescope of the _ c.a.h.a _ ( calar alto , almera , spain ) .",
    "all the details can be found in paper i. the detector used was an rca ccd , with an equivalent field of @xmath19 and a pixel size of 0506 .",
    "the filters used were johnson b and thuan ",
    "gunn g and r ( thuan & gunn 1976 ) , with effective wavelengths of 4416 , 4892 and 6681   , respectively . these filters",
    "avoid the most important emission lines from the sky , which produce a strong fringing in rca ccds . as a consequence ,",
    "the s / n of the images is improved and the detection level is much better .",
    "a more important reason to select these filters refers to the redshifts of both clusters and the predictions obtained by the synthetic models of spectro - photometric evolution ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; rocca  volmerange & guiderdoni 1988 ) .",
    "the magnitudes derived from these filters refer to fluxes emitted at 3120 , 3457 and 4721    in the rest frame of cl  1613 + 3104 , and at 2867 , 3177 and 4338    in the rest frame of cl  1600 + 4109 .",
    "the main feature in the spectrum of galaxies in the optical range is the discontinuity at 4000   , which is located between filters g and r for galaxies at these redshifts ( @xmath200.5 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath21 color gives a good measure of the relative spectral flux before and after the discontinuity , and it is a useful tool to discriminate between cluster and field galaxies .",
    "furthermore , for the same redshift range , the b filter samples a region of the spectrum very sensitive to star formation activity . these filters allow to obtain some reliable information about the population of galaxies and the star formation history in these clusters .    for each filter and cluster",
    ", we took equivalent exposures on an empty field near the cluster ( @xmath22 southward from the center of cl  1613 + 3104 , and @xmath23 southward and @xmath23 westward from the center of cl  1600 + 4109 ) .",
    "these images were reduced in the same way as the cluster ones .",
    "the comparison field allowed the statistical correction of the cluster content for the contamination due to foreground and background objects within the same line - of - sight .",
    "table 1 of paper i gives the main characteristics of the photometric ccd images of the clusters and the respective comparison fields used here . to be sure that the comparison fields are not contaminated by the presence of other clusters of galaxies , we used zwicky et al.s catalog ( 19611968 ) to determine the position of the comparison field with respect to the cluster .",
    "an estimate of the foreground reddening was obtained using the maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) and the galactic extinction law ( cardelli et al .",
    "the reddening correction to each color is less than 0.01 mag in all the cases , which is consistent with the colors obtained for objects identified as stars ( paper i ) .",
    "thus , we did not introduce the reddening correction in our analysis because it is much lower than the absolute photometric accuracy for the brightest objects in the field .",
    "the first goal is to estimate the distribution of galaxies in spectro - morphological types through the observed distribution in colors .",
    "we used bruzual s code ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) for the spectro - photometric evolution of galaxies , in order to obtain the seds corresponding to 6 spectro - morphological types : e / s0 , sa , sbc , scd , i m and a single starburst .",
    "the imf was taken from miller & scalo ( 1979 ) , with a lower and upper cutoff masses of 0.1 and 125.0 @xmath24 respectively .",
    "for each morphological type , we calculate the evolution of colors as a function of the redshift .",
    "the present age of galaxies is assumed to be 15 gyr , which corresponds in this cosmological model to a galaxy formation redshift of 5.3 .",
    "the real transmission functions of the photometric system constituted by the filters plus the ccd response are taken into account to derive the k and e corrections to magnitudes and the synthetic colors . in this way",
    ", observations can be easily compared to color predictions and undesirable color effects are avoided .",
    "the fraction of blue objects , with a definition which is similar to that given by bo , is also determined .",
    "the contamination due to fore and background galaxies has been evaluated as a function of the different magnitudes and colors by means of the comparison field .",
    "this is a key point because the population of cluster galaxies appears as an excess with respect to the field population .",
    "in particular , the schechter luminosity function ( schechter 1976 ) is used to fit the distribution of galaxies in b , @xmath25 through a gauss ",
    "newton @xmath26 minimization algorithm .    the 2d distribution of galaxies has also been studied . to evaluate the degree of central concentration of the clusters , we computed the concentration index ( c ) , r@xmath27 and n@xmath27 , as defined by butcher & oemler ( 1978 )",
    ". nevertheless , these parameters need an accurate determination of the extent of the cluster and a good correction of the fore and background contamination .",
    "therefore , we also used the average central density , n@xmath28 ( bahcall 1981 ) , which is very easily determined and almost insensitive to these errors .",
    "the projected densities of these clusters ( number of galaxies per surface unit or surface brightness ) were fitted using a gauss ",
    "newton @xmath26 minimization algorithm to the analytic profile given by : @xmath29 this law corresponds to the hubble profile when @xmath30 .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , the sample used is defined within the completeness limit in magnitude .",
    "the center of the cluster is defined as the optical barycenter of the central brightest galaxy , when there is only one ( cl  1600 + 4109 ) , or as the optical barycenter of the whole central group of galaxies ( cl  1613 + 3104 ) .",
    "the existence of subclustering and the presence of segregation in luminosity and color can be detected performing the angular - separation test ( @xmath31-method ) proposed by hickson ( 1977 ) , as developed by capelato et al .",
    "this method introduces a set of length scales defined by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of pairs of galaxies and @xmath34 , the angular separation between galaxies _ i _ and _ j_.",
    "the @xmath31 values are calculated over successive magnitude or color intervals , to check for the existence of segregations in luminosity and color .",
    "this test has the advantage of being independent of the position of the center and the shape of the cluster .",
    "we adopted the definition of _ segregation _ given by capelato et al .",
    "we used @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the field has been limited within a circle smaller than the image size to avoid the edge effects .",
    "the size of the different magnitude or color intervals were imposed in such a way that each one contains approximately the same number of galaxies .",
    "figure 1 shows the histograms in absolute magnitude for the b filter as well as the distribution in colors , before and after correction for contamination using the comparison field .",
    "only objects unambiguously identified as stars have been excluded from the sample ( following the method explained in paper i ) .",
    "the luminosity function in b has been derived according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , using the same k correction for all the objects ( assuming that they are all e / s0 galaxies ) .",
    "the fit gives : @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( reduced @xmath26 is 3.75 , with 3 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "these values are compatible with those derived by colles ( 1989 ) for a sample of 14 rich and nearest ( @xmath40 ) clusters , also using a @xmath26 minimizing method .",
    "if we assume @xmath41 , then , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( the reduced @xmath26 is 1.78 with 4 degrees of freedom ) , which are very close to the values obtained by colles , fixing also @xmath44 .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in colors clearly shows a double peak in @xmath21 .",
    "this configuration divides the sample of galaxies into blue ( @xmath45 ) and red ( @xmath46 ) populations .",
    "the separation into populations is less evident in @xmath47 , which shows only one broad peak centered around 0.4 . in @xmath48 , the sample of galaxies shows an important fraction of blue galaxies ( @xmath49 ) and the presence of a red population ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams for the cluster , where the separation between stars , galaxies and unidentified objects has been introduced according to table 2 in paper i. the red sequence for the distribution of e / s0 galaxies is less relevant than in other clusters ( for example , compared with bo or dressler & gunn ( 1992 ) , for the same type of clusters ) .",
    "an important blue population appears in these diagrams , as preliminary evidence in favor of an important fraction of star  forming galaxies .",
    "this population is examined below .",
    "table 1 gives the distribution in spectro - photometric types of objects in excess in the cluster field with respect to the comparison field .",
    "spectrophotometric types are determined as boxes on the color - color plane .",
    "extremely blue objets ( eb ) are objects bluer than the values predicted for an i m type at the cluster redshift .",
    "again , only objects identified unambiguously as stars have been excluded from the sample .",
    "figure 3 shows the color - color distribution of objects for three intervals in r magnitude , where we superimposed the synthetic sequence of morphological types derived using bruzual s code .",
    "the population of blue galaxies in the color  color diagram increases with the magnitude , as shown in table 1 . nevertheless , to obtain the absolute distribution in spectro - morphological types from these values",

    "then , the total number of objects with m@xmath62 ( equivalent to @xmath63 for elliptical galaxies at @xmath0 ) is only 60 within the cutoff radius of the cluster ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) , and 21 within r@xmath27 (= 42@xmath64 , sect .",
    "eight of them have @xmath65 colors 0.2 mag bluer than a typical e galaxy .",
    "the equivalent values in the comparison field within r@xmath27 are 8 and 3 , respectively , so the contamination level is about 4050% .",
    "the fraction of blue objects inferred in this way is @xmath66 , which is higher than the typical value and only marginally compatible with the _",
    "z_f@xmath67 relation obtained by bo for a rich cluster at @xmath9 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this fraction increases if we redefine the fraction of blue objects by considering the sample within the completeness limit in g ( g@xmath69 = 24.25 ) and within r@xmath27 .",
    "the total number of objects is 41 , with a contamination level of about 40 to @xmath70 . among them , 22 are `` blue '' objects and the contamination level for this sample is also about @xmath70 , so @xmath71 .",
    "14 of these objects are compatible with stars according to their colors .",
    "the remaining objects are classified as follows , assuming that they are cluster members : 4 as s galaxies , 3 as i m galaxies and 1 as an extremely blue object .",
    "the shape of cl  1613 + 3104 is basically circular with an ellipticity @xmath72 ( defined as @xmath73 , where a and b are , respectively , the major and the minor axes of the ellipse ) and a position angle @xmath74 with respect to the n ",
    "s direction ( vlchez  gmez et al .",
    "this ellipticity is small enough to assume radial symmetry .",
    "the cluster core presents a compact group of 6 luminous galaxies ( fig .",
    "1 in paper i ) within a radius of about @xmath75 ( 121 h@xmath10 kpc ) around the center , with magnitudes between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    two partially overlapping images are available in r , one of them shifted @xmath78 with respect to the other .",
    "therefore , as the spatial coverage is larger in r , we have used these images to estimate the concentration of the cluster .",
    "the equivalent image on the comparison field gives the zero point for the projected density of galaxies .",
    "we have calculated the cluster profile and we have defined the cutoff radius as the distance at which the projected density coincides with the density in the comparison field .",
    "the cutoff radius obtained is @xmath79 ( 718 h@xmath10 kpc ) .",
    "the total number of objects inside this radius is 456 , and 207 of which have a magnitude lower than the completeness limit in r ( r@xmath69 ) .",
    "the number of objects found for the comparison field , under the same conditions , is 264 and 90 , respectively .",
    "assuming that all galaxies are elliptical , the magnitude r@xmath69= 24.0 is equivalent to @xmath80 , taking into account the distance modulus and the k+e correction . with this limit of magnitude , the concentration parameter derived is @xmath81 , with @xmath82 ( 292 h@xmath10 kpc ) and n@xmath83 , indicating a highly concentrated cluster .",
    "if we take the limit in magnitude used by bo ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , we obtain a concentration parameter @xmath86 , with @xmath87 ( 298 h@xmath10 kpc ) and n@xmath88 . in this case , the total number of objects in the cluster field is much lower : 60 compared to 16 in the comparison field .",
    "the central galaxy density , @xmath89 , is 24 and the velocity dispersion , estimated from the empirical relation found by bahcall ( 1981 ) , is 10001200  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "all these results confirm that we are dealing with a rich , compact cluster .",
    "the projected galaxy density profile can be derived by fitting the cluster profile according to eq .",

    "these radii are similar to the typical radii found for other rich clusters with similar redshifts , such as a  370 ( mellier et al .  1988 ) .",
    "the luminosity and color segregations are important in cl  1613 + 3104 .",
    "figure 4 displays the values of the characteristic lengths for different magnitude and color bins .",
    "there is a segregation in luminosity ( manifest for @xmath36 in fig .",
    "4a ) as well as a clear segregation in color ( fig .",
    "4b ) . to check on the independence of these segregation effects ,",
    "we have applied this method to different color and magnitude samples within the completeness limits in magnitude ( figs .",
    "4c and 4d ) .",
    "the brightest and reddest objects are more concentrated because their characteristic lengths are systematically shorter than those for the faint , blue objects . in contrast , bright _ and _ blue objects appear anti - segregated , as expect for stars and foreground galaxies in this small field .",
    "if we select a sample of objects with the same @xmath95 , in the color range @xmath96 , the luminosity segregation becomes evident ( fig .",
    "conversely , a sample of magnitude - selected objects with the same @xmath95 , shows clearly a color segregation ( fig .",
    "so , these segregation effects are independent , at least up to @xmath97 .",
    "objects fainter than @xmath97 are quite uniformly distributed .",
    "moreover , the red , luminous galaxies preferentially appear in the central part of the cluster .",
    "if we consider the magnitude and color distribution of objects brighter than r@xmath69 as a function of their radial distance to the central galaxy , galaxies lying within a radius of @xmath98 ( 107 h@xmath10 kpc ) from the center are redder and brighter than the outside population ( the contamination expected in this region is lower than @xmath99 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the contour plots of the projected number density of galaxies , for a red sample ( @xmath100 ) and a blue sample ( @xmath101 ) , according to the distribution of galaxies in @xmath21 ( sect .",
    "the mean projected densities obtained over the cluster field for these two samples are @xmath102 and @xmath103 objects  arcsec@xmath104 respectively .",
    "these values can be compared to the equivalent ones in the comparison field : @xmath105 and @xmath106 objects  arcsec@xmath104 respectively . in conclusion ,",
    "the red population is strongly concentrated around the center of the cluster ( fig .",
    "5a ) whereas the blue is uniformly distributed ( fig .",
    "very similar 2d distributions are obtained by dividing the sample into bright ( @xmath107 ) and faint ( @xmath108 ) objects , which are fully compatible with the results shown in figs .",

    "the number of objects detected in this field is lower than in cl  1613 + 3104 .",

    "the luminosity function in b is compatible with the standard values derived by colless ( 1989 ) for a sample of rich low - redshift clusters .",
    "the absolute magnitudes derived for their brightest galaxies , after applying the standard k+e correction , are similar .",
    "the main galaxy in cl  1600 + 4109 is slightly brighter than that of cl  1613 + 3104 ( @xmath141 compared to @xmath142 , within the isophote corresponding to @xmath143 of the background sky noise ) .",
    "comparison of the two histograms in m@xmath67 for cl 1600 + 4109 and cl  1613 + 3104 , after correction through the comparison field ( figs .  1 and 6 ) , shows that the completeness magnitude in cl  1613 + 3104 is 1.2 mag fainter than in cl  1600 + 4109 when a k correction for e / s0 galaxies is used , and this value reduces to 0.9 mag when a standard k+e correction is applied .",
    "nevertheless , most galaxies with magnitudes around b@xmath69 in both clusters are s / im galaxies .",
    "when the k correction used is that of an sb galaxy , the completeness magnitude in cl  1613 + 3104 is 0.6 mag fainter than in cl  1600 + 4109 , and the difference reduces to 0.3 mag after a k+e correction .",
    "so the absolute detection level in cl  1600 + 4109 is poorer than in cl  1613 + 3104 .",
    "the main reason for this is probably the difference in the seeing conditions between both clusters .",
    "cl  1613 + 3104 was observed with an averaged seeing of @xmath144 , whereas the seeing was @xmath145 for cl  1600 + 4109 , but the isophotes used to integrate fluxes were 0.5 mag fainter in the later ( see paper i ) .",
    "a straightforward simulation of photometry has been done , taking the best r image of cl  1613 + 3104 ( seeing @xmath146 ) and debasing it to an equivalent seeing of @xmath147 .",
    "as expected , a general tendency appears in the isophotal magnitudes : objects in the bad - seeing image tend to be measured as fainter than in the good - seeing one , and this effect increases with the magnitude .",
    "the brightest objects ( @xmath148 ) , such as the main cluster - galaxies , are almost unaffected , the difference being lower than 0.1 mag .",
    "this difference is about 0.2 mag for objects with @xmath97 , and it increases to 0.4 mag for the faintest objects in the sample , up to @xmath149 . using a fainter isophote to integrate magnitudes , as it was done for cl  1600 + 4109 , strongly reduces the effect . when the isophotal magnitude is the same in both the good and the bad seeing images , the difference in magnitude for the faintest objects can be as large as 0.7 to 1 mag .",

    "the general trend is that the fraction of blue galaxies in excess with respect to an empty field increases with magnitude . nevertheless , getting the absolute distribution in morphological types is only possible when the sample of galaxies is limited within the magnitude of completeness in _ all",
    "_ the filters involved .",
    "otherwise , a bias is introduced , as can be seen in figs .  2 and 7 .",
    "the result is that the fraction of blue objects detected in both clusters should be considered as an upper bound because the detection of red objects is not complete . in cl  1613 + 3104 ,",
    "the color - color diagrams are only complete for objects bluer than b @xmath51 r = 0.25 and g @xmath51 r = 0.5 in the interval @xmath152 and b @xmath51 r = @xmath510.5 and g @xmath51 r = @xmath510.25 when @xmath153 . in cl  1600",

    "however , even if the absolute ratio of blue to red objects is biased , the both cluster fields show clearly an excess of extremely blue objects in comparison with an empty field , and the number of such objects increases with the magnitude .",
    "table 3 gives the location in the color - color plane of a single burst of star formation , as seen at the redshifts of both clusters , as a function of its age .",
    "it is assumed that the light coming from the stellar mass created by the burst is responsible for the bulk of the energy in the spectra .",
    "when we compare these values with the color - color distributions shown in figs .  3 and 8 , it appears that most extremely blue objects in both clusters are compatible with the colors expected for such burst models younger than a few @xmath154  yr .",
    "high quality images of these clusters could confirm the hypothesis that these galaxies are going through mergers or tidal interactions .",
    "these observations would reinforce the idea that triggers of starburst processes were more frequent in the past than in the present epoch .",
