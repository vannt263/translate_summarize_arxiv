    "it is now well established that long - duration @xmath1-ray bursts ( grbs ) coincide with the explosions of certain massive stars , i.e. , with a subset of very energetic core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) . in particular , three such cases must be regarded as secure .",
    "the first was the association of sn1998bw with grb980425 @xcite .",
    "this connection was , however , quite debated until an unambiguous association was revealed between grb030329 and sn2003dh @xcite .",
    "sn2003dh also showed properties almost identical to that of sn  1998bw .",
    "a third event has now filled in the picture with the spectroscopically confirmed association between grb031203 and sn2003lw @xcite .    because the detection of grbs in @xmath1-rays is unaffected by intervening gas and dust",
    ", they provide a powerful and possibly unbiased tracer of star - formation in the high-@xmath6 universe .",
    "this highlights the importance of studies of grb host galaxies .",
    "previous studies indicate that the majority of grb host galaxies are blue and sub - luminous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on these properties of grb host galaxies , @xcite discussed whether a sizable portion of global star - formation occurs in small and rather unobscured , modestly star - forming galaxies that are too faint to appear in other surveys of star - formation activity , or whether grbs trace only a fraction of the star - forming population , for example due to metallicity effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the most nearby grb host galaxies , and the ones that are undoubtedly directly connected to the deaths of massive stars , allow for a more detailed analysis .",
    "@xcite used x - ray observations to constrain the star - formation rates in the host galaxies of the three sn - grb associations mentioned above . in the present study , we will instead use optical observations to address the same questions . in sect .",

    "given the small size of the object ( see fig .  [",

    "we retrieved early high - resolution spectra of grb030329 from the eso archive , mainly with the aim of searching for the absorption lines of na  i  d and hence constrain the amount of extinction along the line - of - sight to the burst .",
    "these lines are often used in sn studies for this purpose ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observations were obtained 16 hours after the burst on 2003 march 30 with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves )  on the vlt @xcite .",

    "the [ ] @xmath17 line was measured at @xmath18 , which yields z=0.168525 , and h@xmath4 @xmath19 was measured at @xmath20 which gives z=0.168528 .",
    "the measured wavelengths are corrected for the barycentric velocity .",
    "the measured emission line fluxes from the host galaxies of grb980425 and grb030329 are given in table  [ t : linefluxes ] . in that table",
    "we also provide line fluxes for the host galaxy of grb031203 , from the thorough analysis presented by @xcite .    we note",
    "that for grb030329 the main difference between the results presented by @xcite and those by @xcite is the absence of significant [ ] emission .",
    "the detection of this emission line by @xcite in the spectrum from 1 may 2003 appears to have been spurious .",
    "it is not seen in any of the other spectra published by @xcite and the lack of [ ] emission is also noted by @xcite .      from the measured emission line fluxes we have made an attempt to constrain the metallicities of the three host galaxies .",
    "we followed the methods outlined by @xcite and by @xcite to derive metallicity estimates from the strong emission lines .",
    "these estimates are based on the r23 technique which is an empirical relation between the oxygen abundance and the intensity ratio of the strong oxygen emission lines ( [ ] 3727   , and [ ] 4959,5007   ) to h@xmath21 .",
    "this relationship is , however , not unique and therefore provides two possible solutions ( _ lower _ and _ upper branch _ ) for the nebular oxygen abundance .",
    "this degeneracy may be resolved by including other lines such as [ ] 6584   .      using the prescription of @xcite for the emission line strengths of oxygen measured for the host of grb030329 we can derive a metallicity of either @xmath22 ( lower branch ) or @xmath23 ( upper branch ) .",
    "the lower branch value would suggest a metallicity significantly below solar which would also be consistent with the luminosity of the galaxy ( see , e.g. , fig .  6 in * ? ? ? * ) ( or fig .  4 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , based on the emission lines alone we can not exclude a metallicity closer to solar ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath24=8.7 , * ? ? ?",
    "despite the depth of the vlt / fors spectrum , [ ] 4363    and [ ] 6584    were not detected . using the various diagnostic tools summarized by @xcite we did not manage to break the degeneracy of the oxygen abundance solution based on the r23 ratio . in fact , using our upper limit",
    "on together with the [ ] , h@xmath4 , and [ ] fluxes only gives weak constraints for most published diagnostic diagrams @xcite , i.e. , 12+log(o / h)@xmath25 .",
    "also our [ ] detection gives only weak constraints when compared to and h@xmath4 .",
    "hence we could not constrain the oxygen abundance of the host of grb030329 using the emission line fluxes , but it appears to be sub - solar .",
    "for the host galaxy of grb980425 we have performed a similar analysis based on the emission line fluxes .",
    "we caution that the absolute fluxing in the bluest part of the spectrum , where [ ] is located , may be affected by systematic uncertainties in the flux - calibration .",
    "this , as well as uncertainties in the extinction corrections may affect the metallicity estimates , but does not alter the overall results .",
    "we extracted spectra from three spatial locations within the host galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ f : all ] ) .",
    "the metallicities were then derived using the recipe in @xcite . in this case , we have enough information to support the upper branch of the r23 diagnostic , and find the metallicities shown in table  [ t : metal ] .",
    "thus , this galaxy does not have a very low metallicity .",
    "there may be a slight variation in the metallicity across the galaxy , but given the uncertainties we do not regard this as a significant result .",
    "we note that the emission lines of [ ] are stronger at the site of the burst .",
    "as argued by @xcite this is indicative of a high degree of ionization , suggesting a substantial population of young and massive stars .",
    "such an interpretation is also supported by our modeling of the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sect .",
    "[ sect : types ] ) .",
    "the collected dataset allows some estimates of the extinction in the hosts .",
    "the extinctions are also needed for estimating the star formation rates below .    for the grb030329 host galaxy",
    "there are several estimates of the extinction available .",
    "first , the photometric spectral energy distribution of the host as fitted by @xcite favours a starburst galaxy with an intrinsic @xmath26  mag .",
    "the galactic extinction in this direction is estimated to be @xmath27  mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argued for a low extinction .",
    "they based their arguments on the balmer decrement and also made an estimate based on the assumed power - law properties of the afterglow emission .",
    "the latter method gave a limit on the extinction towards the burst of @xmath28 , implying that there is no evidence for extragalactic dust along the line of sight between us and grb030329 .",
    "the high - resolution spectroscopy of the afterglow of grb030329 discussed above ( sect .",
    "[ observationsuves ] ) also speaks in favor of a very low amount of dust towards the grb . at the position of the galactic sodium lines we do detect a weak line .",
    "the @xmath29 component has an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath30  m .",
    "this small ew is fully consistent with the low amount of galactic extinction in this direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the position of the na  i  d lines at the redshift of grb030329 we detect no significant absorption",
    ". any such absorption must be at least four times weaker than the galactic component . although the degree of ionization could be different in the grb030329 host and the galaxy , this at least points to a very small amount of reddening along the line of sight to grb030329 .",
    "we must remember , however , that the line - of - sight towards the grb need not be representative for the entire host galaxy . it may even be that dust is destroyed by the burst itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the grb980425 host galaxy we have limited information on the extinction .",
    "the galactic extinction in this direction is estimated to be @xmath31  mag @xcite . according to @xcite",
    "there was no sign of na  i  d absorption in high - resolution spectra obtained at the sn maximum .",
    "these authors used this finding to argue for an extinction of @xmath32  mag towards the sn , i.e. , a again very small amount of reddening .",
    "also the balmer decrement from the spectra indicate a low reddening , which is also consistent with our sed modeling ( sect .",
    "[ 980425mod ] ) .",
    "there are several ways to estimate star formation rates ( sfr ) in galaxies .",
    "one option is simply to use the emission line luminosities of h@xmath4 or [ ] and follow the prescription by @xcite .    for the grb980425 host galaxy we have used narrow band imaging to estimate the flux in h@xmath4 , since this galaxy is much larger than the extent of our spectroscopic slit .",
    "the final continuum subtracted image is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : all ] .",
    "the host galaxy is clearly visible .",
    "we also note that no other source was detected in the field of view . from this image we derived an integrated h@xmath4 flux of @xmath33  erg  s@xmath8  @xmath34 .",
    "the integrated ew is 60.6   . if we correct these for a 10@xmath35 contribution from the [ ] emission line within the filter band ( as estimated from the spectroscopy ) , and for a galactic extinction of @xmath36 mag we get for the distance of grb980425 a luminosity of l@xmath37  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "the corrected ew is 54.5   .",
    "we thus derive a global sfr of @xmath38  yr@xmath8 while the bright hii region northwest of the explosion site of sn1998bw has @xmath39  yr@xmath8 .",
    "these estimates have also been corrected for galactic extinction and for a 10@xmath35 contamination of [ ] emission inside the narrow band filter .",
    "for the grb030329 host we obtain the following integrated sfr ;    sfr@xmath40  yr@xmath8    sfr@xmath41}=0.22~$ ]  yr@xmath8    we note that these values are consistent with the values reported by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath4 line sits close to a telluric absorption line and was not used by @xcite to estimate the sfr .",
    "these values are for a galactic extinction only .",
    "an extinction as suggested by @xcite , @xmath42 would alter these numbers to    sfr@xmath43  yr@xmath8    sfr@xmath41}=0.48~$ ]  yr@xmath8    this of course applies only to the part of the galaxy included in the slit - although we argue that this was actually the major part .",
    "these estimates are similar to the sfr reported by @xcite , 0.5  yr@xmath8 , although the agreement appears to be somewhat accidental .",
    "we were unable to reproduce their high l@xmath44 also from their publicly available spectra , but on the other hand they assume a much lower extinction correction .",
    "the sfr estimated from the optical emission lines must be regarded as lower limits , since there may also exists an extinguished star - forming population , as in many other starburts .",
    "for example , the host of grb000210 revealed a sfr @xmath45  yr@xmath8 from the optical emission lines @xcite , while a tentative sub - mm detection implies a star formation of several hundred solar - masses per year @xcite .    in the case of the sn / grb hosts we also have upper limits on the star formation as obtained from the unbiased x - ray view exploited by @xcite .",
    "for the grb980425 host they find that the x - ray flux within the optical extent of this galaxy is entirely dominated by two point sources @xmath46  apart , one of which is coincident with the radio position of sn1998bw and is almost certainly associated with it @xcite .    from the x - ray emission they estimated a total sfr of @xmath47  yr@xmath8 .",
    "together with our estimate of 0.35  yr@xmath8 the range is therefore quite well constrained for this host galaxy .",
    "for grb030329 we have estimated sfr@xmath48  yr@xmath8 while @xcite estimate a sfr of massive stars ( m@xmath49 , see @xcite ) of less than @xmath50  yr@xmath8 . using a salpeter imf",
    "@xcite this corresponds to a total sfr of @xmath51  yr@xmath8 .",
    "the host of grb980425 , eso184-g82 , is nearby enough to be well resolved with ground based telescopes ( fig .",
    "[ f : all ] ) and appears to be a late type spiral with a bar ( sbc ) .",
    "the beautiful hst image displayed by @xcite shows the optical appearance of the galaxy to be dominated by a large number of high surface brightness starforming regions , especially in the southern spiral arm where the grb / sn occurred .",
    "the total bvri magnitudes we obtained from our vlt images down to an isophote of 25 magnitudes arcsec@xmath52 are reported in table  [ t : esophot ] .",
    "for the adopted distance this gives an absolute magnitude of m@xmath53 .",
    "adopting m@xmath54 we thus find that this galaxy has @xmath55 .",
    "we can use this and the above derived sfr to also get the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) .",
    "for grb980425 we thus derive a ssfr@xmath56  yr@xmath8  ( l / l@xmath57)@xmath8 .",
    "the major axis diameter of the galaxy is 67 arcseconds at the b=26.5 mag arcsec@xmath52 isophote , corrected for foreground milky way extinction , i.e. this is the holmberg diameter .",
    "the minor axis is 57 arcseconds . at a distance of 37  mpc",
    "this corresponds to a physical size of @xmath58  kpc .",
    "comparing our broadband magnitudes to empirical galaxy colours ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we see that the host appears to be a typical , subluminous late type spiral .",
    "to quantitatively compare the colors of the host galaxy we calculated a set of models using the code pegase.2 @xcite which includes both stellar and nebular emission .",
    "this was done using the actual filter profiles and ccd sensitivity for fors1 , and all models assume a salpeter imf in the mass interval 0.1 - 120 .",
    "using a range of different metallicities and star formation timescales we could then compare these models to our data using least - square fitting .",
    "the entire galaxy is well fit with a continuous star formation history .",
    "both an e - folding time of 3  gyr and 15  gyr give good agreements without additional extinction .",
    "the results are not very sensitive to metallicity . independently , the h@xmath4 ew is well fit by such a scenario .",
    "both these scenarios are also able to reproduce the integrated luminosity of the galaxy given that the current sfr has operated for 5 - 7 gyrs .",
    "the galaxy can thus not be regarded as a starburst galaxy .      for the local sn / grb environment",
    "we have conducted a similar exercise .",
    "the photometry is presented in table  [ t : esophot ] and the results of the modeling are quantified and summarized in table  [ t : ostlin ] .",
    "we assumed an instantaneous burst and the same imf parameters as above .",
    "the best fitting age is for each metallicity a well defined minimum , where a change in age as small as @xmath59  myr typically increases the rms deviation with a factor two or more .",
    "for all models , the best - fitting internal reddening is found to be @xmath60 . as is illustrated in table  [ t : ostlin ] , a change in @xmath61 of @xmath62 ,",
    "leads to an increased rms with typically 50 to @xmath63 , but does not affect the best fitting age .",
    "hence , the uncertainties on the derived ages are very small ( @xmath131 myr ) in a statistical sense .",
    "if we take the best fitting age as the lifetime of the supernova progenitor we can estimate its mass from comparison with stellar tracks @xcite .",
    "this gives a zams mass of 30@xmath645  , in accordance with most models for type ic sne in general , and for collapsars in particular .",
    "for grb030329 the magnitudes reported by @xcite imply @xmath65 . with our measured ( extinction corrected ) sfr",
    "this gives a ssfr of @xmath66  yr@xmath8  ( l / l@xmath57)@xmath8 .",
    "as noted by @xcite this is a very high ssfr compared to most galaxies in the hubble deep field .    to constrain the physical size of this host galaxy we used images obtained with the acs onboard the hubble space telescope .",
    "we measured the extent of the host on acs images obtained on 2004 may 24 , i.e. , 422 days after the grb and thus long after the afterglow contribution had vanished .",
    "the fwhm of the host is about @xmath67  pc in the f435w filter image .",
    "the f606w and f814w filters show a slightly larger fwhm of @xmath68  pc .",
    "this is similar to the radius estimated by fitting a sersic model to the surface brightness profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gave a radius of 0.26 arcseconds corresponding to 750 pc for the f606w filter .",
    "we also estimated the holmberg diameter to compare directly with the estimate of the grb980425 host galaxy .",
    "this gave instead @xmath69 , corresponding to 3.9  kpc .",
    "the main conclusion of this exercise is that the host galaxy of grb030329 is a very compact galaxy , with both an absolute magnitude and extension similar to that of the smc .",
    "furthermore , our uves spectroscopy ( sect .",
    "[ observationsuves ] ) resolved the h@xmath4 line with a fwhm of @xmath70  km  s@xmath8 , which for a radius of 0.75 kpc corresponds to a dynamical mass of @xmath71  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may be an underestimate if the h@xmath4 flux is dominated by a central burst and do not trace the full potential well .",
    "the dynamical mass is similar to the mass of smc . in fig .",
    "[ f : all ] we show the host galaxies of grbs030329 and 980425 on the same physical scale .",
    "this comparison reveals that these host galaxies are not that different .",
    "the vlt images of grb980425 are considerably deeper and surface brightness dimming will also suppress the fainter structures in the more remote galaxy .",
    "one difference is the location of the grb within the galaxy .",

    "we note that at cosmological distances such a spatial difference would not have been possible to resolve .    from @xcite",
    "we know that the host of grb030329 has a sed that is best fit by a starburst galaxy template .",

    "the errors are estimated to be about 0.03 magnitudes .",
    "the b and v band results are fairly consistent with @xcite although the i band is measured to be fainter in the hst images .",
    "looking also at the spatially resolved photometry , we note that the colors are significantly redder in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "this means that using an integrated magnitude will overestimate the age of the stellar population ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "this would make the ages estimated by @xcite more consistent with the expected ages from very massive grb progenitors .",

    "we note that our values are somewhat higher than those found by ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is probably because the method we have used does not take into account the additional temperature information from the fainter [ ]  4363    line .",
    "this makes our abundance determinations less secure , and is included here to indicate the uncertainties in the metallicities also for the other two host galaxies .",

    "@xcite we compared gaussian fits to the host galaxy with fits of the nearby stars .",
    "the galaxy is clearly not a point source , but with a seeing of @xmath80 it is only marginally resolved . taking into account the extent of the point spread function",
    "this means that the galaxy fwhm is about 1  2  kpc on the sky .",
    "this is slightly larger than the very compact grb030329 host , but not by much ( fig .",
    "[ f : all ] ) . a j - band image presented by @xcite shows that the grb occurred in the central regions of this galaxy .",
    "the properties of the three sn - grb host galaxies are summarized in table  [ t : big ] .",
    "the star formation rates given in the table are averages between those obtained for h@xmath4 and [ ] , when available . with",
    "only three firmly established grb / sn host galaxies any conclusion regarding this population will be tentative , but it seems that their overall properties are consistent with those established for more distant grb host galaxies ; small , sub - luminous , metal - poor blue galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the host galaxy of grb980425 has , however , not a very low metal abundance - and should not be classified as a starburst galaxy .",
    "@xcite compared the specific star formation rates ( uv to optical colours , since the sfrs were estimated from the near - uv continuum ) of grb hosts to galaxies in the hubble deep field , and concluded that the grb hosts have higher ssfr than @xmath81 of the hdf galaxies .",
    "such a comparison may give the appearance that the grb hosts have very special properties .",
    "however , the hdf comprises a plethora of galaxies of different types with different distances and selection functions .",
    "given that the hosts under study in the present paper are rather nearby , it would be interesting to compare these with galaxies in the local universe with similar properties .",
    "although not comprising a very homogeneous class , blue compact ( dwarf ) galaxies ( bcgs ) and low luminosity emission line selected galaxies ( hii - galaxies ) typically have luminosities below l@xmath82 , low metallicity @xcite , low extinction @xcite and active star formation @xcite .",
    "these are properties often ascribed to grb hosts and the bgc population may therefore serve as an interesting local comparison sample .",
    "@xcite present visual and h@xmath4 luminosities for a large sample of local bcgs , which we have converted into specific star formation rates .",
    "we also added a few luminous bcgs with very active star formation from @xcite to this sample , with the sfrs recalibrated by the @xcite sfr ",
    "relation for the sake of homogeneity . in fig .",
    "[ f : bcg ] we compare the star formation rates and luminosities of the combined bcg sample with that of the three sn - grb hosts of this paper . for this comparison we used the sfrs inferred from h@xmath4 only , and since @xcite do not present internal extinction , we use vales corrected for galactic extinction only in order to be consistent .",
    "the combined samples cover a range in ssfr from @xmath83 to 100  yr@xmath8 ( l / l@xmath57)@xmath8 while the typical bcg has a ssfr close to 10 .",
    "while this large range of values confirms that this class of galaxies is not very homogeneous , we see that the sn / grb host galaxies have similar properties to this class .",
    "it is among these galaxies that we find the most active star forming sub - luminous galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the bcgs with ssfr @xmath84 have moderately active star formation and this would also be the location occupied by ordinary dwarf irregulars and disk galaxies , such as the host of grb980425 .",
    "the other two sn / grb hosts would probably have been classified as actively starforming bcgs if they would have been more nearby .",
    "bcgs are believed to account for a significant amount of the sfr also at higher redshifts .",
    "still , in a magnitude limited sample , such galaxies are in minority . in this respect",
    "the results by @xcite and @xcite can be understood  the majority of the ( sn/)grbs occur in the few percent of the magnitude limited population that has the highest ssfr , both at low and high redshifts , i.e. , galaxies with properties similar to bcgs / hii - galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we have mined several archives and data sets in order to characterize the host galaxies that are known to have harbored a grb - sn . the picture of compact low luminosity , metal poorish galaxies in a starforming phase is established , consistent with other studies of ordinary and more distant grbs @xcite .",
    "the local extinction in these galaxies appears to be small .",
    "we have proposed that a population of blue compact galaxies have similar properties to the grb - sn host galaxies .    for the host of grb980425 we have for the first time derived the star - formation rate .",
    "we have shown that this galaxy is not very metal - poor , and that a population study based on the broad - band photometry is consistent with a normal starforming galaxy with continuous star formation over 5 - 7 gyrs , i.e. , not with a starburst galaxy .",
    "a similar investigation of the spatially resolved hii region where the grb occurred gives us an estimate of the grb progenitor mass of @xmath85 .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical scenarios of sn1998bw being due to a very massive star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . today",
    ", collapsar models - involving the collapse of massive stars - are the favoured models for long grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is therefore very encouraging that this population study confirms such models .",
    "similar observational contraints on the mass of supernova progenitors are becoming very useful for constraining sn models ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "for the host of grb030329 we provide high - resolution hst imaging which reveals the morphology and location of the burst .",
    "it shows the host to be a very compact galaxy indeed .",
    "an early high - resolution spectrum provides a very accurate redshift determination and the lack of sodium lines in this spectra supports a very low extinction towards the grb .",
    "the width of the resolved h@xmath4 provides an estimate of the dynamical mass of the galaxy .",
    "our low - resolution spectra give useful constraints on the metallicity , but we also show that the analysis is less straight - forward than previously acknowledged .",
    "this study thus provides a smorgasbord of what can be learned from optical data of relatively nearby host galaxies .",
    "we hope that more such galaxies will be discovered with the swift satellite . to characterize this population is important to understand selection biases in determining the high - z starformation rates via grb selected galaxies .",
    "swift has the potential to point us to a large number of such distant galaxies .",
    "the datasets used in this investigation were mainly obtained to study the individual sne - grbs and were not really optimized for the host studies .",
