    "laplace pressure driven snap - off relies upon an instability that forms when a confined dispersed phase is allowed to penetrate into a larger space filled with an immiscible continuous phase ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic]a ) .",
    "the instability requires no viscous interaction , but is due entirely to changes in the curvature of the interface between the two phases , affecting the laplace pressure .",
    "we have previously found that the resulting droplets are highly monodisperse  @xcite , as the system becomes unstable immediately after the protrusion of the dispersed phase reaches a critical size .",
    "the snap - off phenomenon has been studied and used to produce droplets in many different geometries @xcite .",
    "however , the case of ejecting the dispersed phase from a cylindrically symmetric tube is the simplest from a theoretical standpoint @xcite .    , minimum radius of the flowing dispersed phase column within the nozzle @xmath0 , and radius of the growing droplet @xmath1 define the important length scales .",
    "the relevant pressures are the pressure of the bulk continuous phase @xmath2 , pressure of the dispersed phase in the growing droplet @xmath3 , pressure of the dispersed phase in the nozzle @xmath4 , and the pressure of the continuous phase in the collar around the dispersed phase @xmath5 .",
    "b ) schematic of these pressures along the length of the pipette .",
    "snapoff occurs if @xmath6 , which happens as @xmath7 grows , decreasing @xmath8 and the other pressures relative to the fixed pressure @xmath9.,width=264 ]    by neglecting pressure gradients within the dispersed phase , several groups have been able to provide a theoretical framework for droplet sizes in a quasi - static regime @xcite .",
    "the approximation of a static dispersed phase has been shown to be valid in regimes that are useful for droplet production @xcite .",
    "additionally , it was shown that droplets grow larger before snapping off at higher flow rates , and eventually grow indefinitely for sufficiently large flow rates @xcite . the ability to deliberately vary droplet size without changing the apparatus , for instance by changing the flow rate , represents a useful experimental control variable . nevertheless , a model which can predict the size of snap - off droplets at flow rates where the quasi - static approximation is no longer valid has remained elusive .",
    "previous studies have examined the effects of changes in geometry , interfacial tension , and viscosity ratio between the two fluids on the droplet production@xcite . however , many of these investigations have been largely qualitative in nature .    here , we present experiments that are compared to a model predicting the size of droplets produced through the snap - off mechanism over a wide range of flow rates .",
    "the model provides a `` stability diagram '' : regions on a plot of the droplet radius as a function of the flow rate where droplets are stable and grow , contrasted with regions where the droplets are unstable and snap off .",
    "the stability diagram elucidates a pathway for manipulation of the system to produce droplets at both sizes and flow rates where snap - off would not normally occur .",
    "furthermore , the model we present accounts for the effects of fluid properties and geometry on the droplet production .",
    "the work is carried out in the cylindrically symmetric geometry , although the ideas are easily extended to the flattened geometries that are common for snap - off droplet production .",
    "snap - off occurs when a dispersed phase is ejected from a nozzle into a reservoir of a continuous phase as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]a .",
    "the dispersed phase forms a growing spherical droplet that becomes unstable at some critical size and subsequently snaps - off  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic]b illustrates schematically the location and relative values of the relevant pressures , which we now describe . assuming a quasi - equilibrium",
    ", we can define the pressure of the bulk continuous phase @xmath9 .",
    "the interior pressure of the droplet of dispersed phase is higher than @xmath2 due to the droplet s laplace pressure : @xmath10 where @xmath1 is the radius of the droplet and @xmath11 is the interfacial tension between the dispersed and continuous phase ( fig .  [ fig : schematic]b ) . in more complex , non - cylindrical geometries , growth of the droplet",
    "is restricted in one or more directions , and the laplace pressure difference will depend on the dimensions of the confining chamber @xcite . for snap - off to proceed effectively",
    ", there must be a wetting layer of the continuous phase coating the interior of the nozzle , which forms a transient collar with a minimum radius , @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "again , due to the curvature of the interface at the collar , we can write the laplace pressure difference between the dispersed phase in the nozzle @xmath4 and the continuous phase in the surrounding collar @xmath5 , @xmath12 here we have made a simplifying assumption consistent with experimental obsevations , that @xmath13 is a much smaller radius than that of the orthogonal curvature . as the droplet begins its growth , the wetting layer of the continuous phase is thin , and so @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic]b also indicates another important feature of the flowing fluid , that there is a pressure gradient , @xmath15 , along the cylindrical nozzle .",
    "this pressure gradient is described by poiseuille flow  @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the viscosity of the dispersed phase and @xmath18 is the volumetric flow rate .",
    "we are concerned with the pressure difference between the dispersed phase at the collar , @xmath4 , and that in the droplet , @xmath3 . in practice ,",
    "nozzles with circular apertures are undesirable , as spherical droplets block the opening and prevent the reverse flow of the continuous phase that is necessary for snap - off to occur @xcite .",
    "cylindrical nozzles must therefore have an irregular tip shape that is not easily controlled between nozzles .",
    "the decrease in pressure from @xmath4 to @xmath3 occurs over a length scale with two distinct components .",
    "first , each tip contributes a geometric parameter @xmath19 that is specific to the pipette tip s unique shape , reflecting the distance into the pipette at which the neck of the dispersed phase forms .",
    "second , the pressure must drop to @xmath3 by some distance into the droplet , which contributes @xmath20 , since this dimension scales with the droplet radius .",
    "thus the length scale over which the pressure drops from @xmath4 to @xmath3 is @xmath21 and with eq .",

    "[ eq : laplace ] , and so @xmath23 and @xmath5 all decrease , relative to the constant @xmath2 .",
    "the snap - off instability develops when @xmath24 , causing a reverse flow of the continuous phase from the bulk @xmath2 into the collar @xmath5 .",
    "as the continuous phase flows , the collar constricts the dispersed phase ( @xmath13 decreases ) , which further reduces @xmath5 relative to @xmath4 according to eq .",
    "[ eq : collar ] .",
    "the contracting collar exacerbates the pressure difference driving reverse flow of the continuous phase , and the collar structure rapidly collapses , releasing the droplet @xcite . using our relations between the pressures and with @xmath14 , we can rewrite the snap - off condition @xmath24 as : @xmath25 when this inequality is satisfied , the collar is unstable and shrinks to release the droplet .",
    "previous efforts to predict snap - off droplet size have been restricted to the low flow limit of the dispersed phase @xcite . in this case ,",

    "[ eq : snapoff ] simplifies to the condition @xmath28 as we have shown in a previous study@xcite .",

    "[ eq : snapoff ] can be rewritten to define unstable droplets as @xmath33 the expression can be solved to find the values of @xmath34 for which the left side equals zero : @xmath35    eq .",
    "[ eq : rofq ] defines a critical non - dimensional droplet radius @xmath34 for a given rescaled flow rate @xmath36 . beyond the critical radius , the continuous phase invades the nozzle containing the dispersed phase , causing the droplet to snap - off .",
    ".  [ eq : rofq ] can thus be interpreted as follows : for a given flow rate , the droplet grows , while still attached by the collar to the dispersed phase .",
    "eventually the droplet grows to the critical radius given by eq .",

    "[ eq : nondimensional ] .",
    "in this situation , the distance @xmath20 is large .",
    "thus , the pressure gradient necessary to drive the flow into the large droplet ensures that @xmath4 , and thus @xmath5 , stay large and @xmath38 even for arbitrarily large droplets .    in reality ,",
    "no droplets are able to grow indefinitely , as large droplets break away from the pipette due to their buoyancy .",
    "it is important to note that this separation represents a different mechanism than the laplace - pressure driven snap - off . here , the buoyant force overcomes the interfacial tension , similar to droplets forming on a leaky ceiling @xcite .",
    "the size at which buoyant forces are sufficient to separate the droplet from the pipette depends on both the shape and orientation of the tip , as well as the flow rate .",
    "we assume that for a particular pipette , there is some critical droplet volume @xmath39 beyond which the droplet is unstable to buoyancy .",
    "however , droplets take some fixed amount of time @xmath40 to detach from the pipette and continue to grow at the same flow rate during this time . the volume of droplets that break away from the pipette",
    "is therefore expressed simply as @xmath41 . the droplet radius at buoyant separation is then given by : @xmath42 which is plotted as the upper solid curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "while @xmath43 depends on several details of the pipette tip geometry , we note that it should scale as @xmath44 suggesting that larger droplets are possible by increasing the surface tension or better matching the densities of the two fluids .",

    "in fact , the pipettes are not perfectly cylindrical , but taper gradually from diameter @xmath52 m to @xmath51 m over several centimetres , and so pipettes with larger openings can be produced by breaking the pipettes further from the tip . unless otherwise stated , the dispersed phase was mineral oil and the continuous phase was water with 1% ( by weight ) sodium dodecyl sulphate ( sds ) added to stabilize droplets against fusion .",
    "droplets were produced by ejecting oil out of a pipette into a chamber filled with the water phase , taking care that the pipette tip was far from any chamber boundaries .",
    "the flow rate was controlled by maintaining a connected oil reservoir at a constant pressure , either by adjusting its height or by clamping a syringe .",
    "this procedure results in a constant flow rate at the pipette tip as long as the volume of oil leaving the pipette is negligible compared to the oil reservoir .",
    "droplets were imaged from below at up to 50 frames per second .",
    "the viscosity of the oil phase was decreased for some experiments by mixing dodecane with the mineral oil in concentrations up to @xmath53 by weight .",

    "interestingly , the continuous phase viscosity has no impact on snap - off over the entire range tested , including cases where the continuous phase is more viscous than the dispersed phase .",
    "although our model was developed for a cylindrical geometry , it should be applicable to all droplet snap - off geometries with appropriate adjustments .",
    "the model predicts a rich and unexpected stability dependence on droplet size and flow rate , which was confirmed experimentally by producing droplets with radii that are normally forbidden for a particular pipette .",
