    "x - ray bright , off - nuclear point sources in nearby galaxies whose isotropic luminosities exceed the eddington value of a 25 @xmath4 black hole , i.e. , @xmath5 3@xmath610@xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 , are referred to as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "the main debate concerning these objects is whether they are stellar - mass black holes ( mass range of 3 - 25 @xmath4 ) circumventing the eddington limit via high accretion and/or emission ( e.g. , king et al .",
    "2001 ; krding et al . 2002 ; begelman et al . 2002 ; poutanen et al . 2007 ; gladstone et al . 2009 ) , or if they are powered by intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs : mass range of a few 100 - 1000 @xmath4 ) accreting below the eddington limit ( e.g. , colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; miller et al . 2004 , 2013 ) .",
    "recent studies suggest that ulxs are very likely an inhomogeneous sample of both stellar and intermediate - mass black holes ( e.g. , farrell et al .",
    "2009 ; motch et al .",
    "2014 ; pasham et al .",
    "2014 , 2015 ; mezcua et al . 2015 ) ; and in some rare cases may even be powered by neutron stars ( bachetti et al .",
    "2014 ) .    a straightforward way to solve the ulx mass problem is by measuring the dynamical masses of their compact objects .",
    "this involves identifying the compact object s companion star ( an optical counterpart ) and doppler tracking its radial velocity ( using spectroscopic lines ) from which one can extract the orbital period of the system and the companion s radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "these two quantities can be combined to construct the so - called mass function , which would enable a lower limit on the black hole mass ( see , for example , soria et al .",
    "1998 for relevant equations ) .",
    "although very challenging , there have been a handful of such attempts that have succeeded in weighing stellar - mass black holes in ulxs ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2013 ; motch et al .",
    "2014 ; see , however , roberts et al . 2011 , cseh et al .",
    "2013 , where the mass could not be tightly constrained ) .",
    "this method is difficult primarily because ulx optical counterparts are extragalactic , and hence faint with v - band magnitudes in the range of 22 - 24 ( e.g. , tao et al .",
    "2011 ; gladstone et al .",
    "2013 ) . extracting their optical spectra",
    "is not only challenging but also very expensive  requiring an 8-m class telescope ( e.g. , cseh et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in the absence of dynamical mass constraints various indirect methods",
    " that have been well - calibrated against stellar - mass black holes  have been used .",
    "for example , it is known in stellar - mass black hole systems that at a given x - ray energy spectral power - law index , the centroid frequency of the low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) scales inversely with the black hole mass ( e.g. , sobczak et al .",
    "2000 ; vignarca et al .",
    "2003 ; shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2009 ) . assuming that the ulx mhz qpos are analogous to the low - frequency qpos of stellar - mass black holes ( 0.2 - 15 hz : casella et al .",
    "2005 ) , various authors have estimated some ulx black hole masses to be in the range of a few@xmath6(100 - 1000 ) @xmath4 ( e.g. , dewangan et al . 2006 ; strohmayer & mushotzky 2009 ; feng et al . 2010 ; rao et al . 2010",
    "; dheeraj & strohmayer 2012 ) .",
    "however , this underlying assumption of mhz qpos being the analogs of the low - frequency qpos has been questioned by some authors ( middleton et al .",
    "2011 ) . in a few cases , in addition to the mhz qpos",
    ", 3:2 frequency ratio high - frequency qpo analogs have also been discovered .",
    "such twin pairs not only confirm that the mhz qpos in these systems are indeed the analogs of the stellar - mass black hole low - frequency qpos , but also enable independent , accurate black hole masses .",
    "assuming the inverse mass  to  qpo frequency relation of stellar - mass high - frequency qpos , the detected 3:2 pairs in m82 x-1 and ngc 1313 x-1 imply a black hole mass of 428@xmath0105 @xmath4 ( pasham et al .",
    "2014 ) , and 5000@xmath01300 @xmath4 ( pasham et al . 2015 ) , respectively .    another direct method that can be employed to weigh black holes  but has not been hitherto exploited for ulxs  is the so - called reverberation mapping technique .",
    "it is now known that a significant fraction of the optical emission from accreting x - ray binaries is due to x - ray reprocessing in the surrounding accretion disk ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ; reynolds & miller 2013 ) , and current evidence suggests that this may be the case in some ulxs ( tao et al .",
    "2011 ; gladstone et al .",
    "2013 ) . in simple models of this process",
    "the optical emission results from x - ray irradiation of the outer portions of the disk by the central continuum .",
    "the optical emission is thus correlated with the x - ray emission but delayed by the light travel time effects ( hynes et al .",
    "1998 ; gandhi et al .",
    "measurement of the time delay , @xmath9 , will provide a direct estimate of the accretion disk s ( and hence the binary s ) size ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the speed of light ) .",
    "a mass estimate can follow in a manner analogous to agn reverberation mapping ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "the difference is that in ulxs the optical flux is expected to reverberate in response to the variations in the central x - ray flux while in agn the optical broad line flux responds to changes in the optical continuum .",
    "nevertheless , a lag measurement gives a size scale of the accretion disk which can then be combined with measured line widths ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) due to the keplerian motions in the disk . the mass of the ulx s compact object ( @xmath14 ) can then be estimated as , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gravitational constant and @xmath17 is a geometric correction factor whose value is expected to be of order unity .    in practice",
    ", however , the reprocessed optical emission can originate from a wide range of accretion disk radii and from even further out from the face of the companion star illuminated by the x - rays ( e.g. , obrien et al . 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to accurately measure the black hole s mass one would need to particularly measure the lag between the x - rays and the reprocessed optical flux originating from the part of the accretion disk that is spatially coincident with the optical emission lines .",
    "this can , in principle , be achieved by simultaneous x - ray and narrow band optical photometry ( e.g. , see muoz - darias et al .",
    "2007 for the case of sco x-1 ) .",
    "but even with simultaneous x - ray and broad band optical observations it should be possible to clearly distinguish a ulx imbh from a ulx stellar - mass black hole .",
    "this is simply because for a fixed binary orbital period a system hosting an imbh ( say , 1000 @xmath4 ) will be significantly larger than one with a stellar - mass black hole primary ( say , 10@xmath4 ) .",
    "for example , the binary separation scales as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total system mass and additionally , the radius of the roche lobe of the accretor , which sets an upper limit on the size of the accretion disk , also grows significantly with @xmath19 ( e.g. , eggleton 1983 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation can be more complicated as the optical emission from x - ray binaries is not always from just x - ray reprocessing . details of non - reprocessing optical emission and references thereof are discussed briefly in section 6 .",
    "the proposed reverberation methodology will work when the reprocessed optical emission component can be confidently identified .",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 ( hereafter , x-1 ) is a ulx with an average x - ray ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) luminosity of @xmath2 10@xmath20 ergs s@xmath8 ( see , table 4 of dheeraj & strohmayer 2012 ) . based on its high luminosity and the observed mhz qpo frequency range of 10 - 40 mhz ( dheeraj & strohmayer 2012 ; caballero - garca et al . 2013 )",
    ", it has been suggested to host an imbh with mass anywhere between a few@xmath6(100 - 1000 ) @xmath4 ( dheeraj & strohmayer 2012 ) .",
    "gris et al .",
    "( 2012 ) modeled the x - ray / uv / optical / nir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ulx and concluded that its optical emission is consistent with originating from an x - ray irradiated accretion disk .",
    "in addition , deep optical spectroscopy of this source has revealed the presence of a he ii @xmath214686 @xmath22 emission line whose broad component has an average full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath2 780@xmath064 km s@xmath8 ( cseh et al . 2011 ; 2013 ) .",
    "based on the observed @xmath2 13% variability of this broad emission component over a time span of roughly 4 years and its gaussian profile , cseh et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2013 ) argued that this broad line arises from keplerian motion within an accretion disk rather than a donor star . assuming that to be the case ,",
    "if one can measure the distance of this optical broad line emitting site from the central black hole , it can be combined with the line width to directly measure the mass of the black hole using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it can be noted straightforwardly from this equation that for x-1 s black hole mass in the range of a few@xmath6(100 - 1000 ) @xmath4 the expected time lags based on the line width are a few@xmath6(100 - 1000 ) s. the maximum of the optical and the x - ray time resolution sets a lower limit on the time lag , and hence the black hole mass that can be probed with this method . in this proof - of - concept study for x - ray  optical reverberation , we are sensitive to black hole masses greater than 600 @xmath4 because of an optical time resolution of 440 s.    the article",
    "is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the optical data acquired by the very large telescope ( vlt ) and the x - ray data taken with _",
    "xmm - newton_. in section 3 , we describe the procedure we used to extract the optical light curve while in section 4 we describe the x - ray data analysis .",
    "we present the cross - correlation analysis in section 5 and discuss the implications and future prospects in section 6 .",
    "the focal reducer spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) on the vlt ( ut1 , `` antu '' ) observed the field of view containing x-1 ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; lang et al .",
    "2007 ) in imaging mode on three consecutive nights  for approximately 16 ks each night  starting from 2014 february 12 until 2014 february 14@xmath25 .",
    "the typical exposure times were 165 s on the night of the 12@xmath26 and 120 s on the nights of the 13@xmath26 and the 14@xmath26 .",
    "the source was also observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ for approximately 2@xmath636 ks on the nights of the 11@xmath26 and the 13@xmath26 providing roughly 16 ks of useful simultaneous x - ray and optical photometric data .",
    "as discussed earlier , the optical exposure time sets an absolute lower limit on the time lag , and hence the black hole mass that can be probed . as the time resolution of 120 s",
    "is much longer than the typical x - ray ",
    "optical lags of a few tens of seconds in stellar - mass x - ray binaries , these measurements are only sensitive to weigh imbhs with masses greater than a few 100 @xmath4 .",
    "a summary of the observational setup of the imaging mode is outlined in table 1 .    since",
    "our main goal is to search for optical reverberation , we chose a standard fors2 g_high filter with an effective wavelength of 4700 @xmath27 and a fwhm of 1150 @xmath27 , which is the band that provided the most optical signal ( see figure 4 of kaaret & corbel 2009 ) .",
    "although the he ii @xmath214686 @xmath27 broad emission line falls in the same band it is expected to have negligible contribution to the overall optical variability .",
    "the he ii @xmath214686",
    "@xmath27 flux is typically a factor of @xmath2 80 lower than the optical continuum flux ( see table 3 of kaaret & corbel 2009 ) .",
    "the same filter was used on all the nights .",
    "fors2 is equipped with a mosaic of two 2k@xmath64k mit ccds ( chip1 & chip2 ) with a pixel size of 15@xmath615 @xmath28 m .",
    "although the intrinsic pixel scale is 0.126@xmath29 the standard data binning of 2@xmath62 was used during all the observations providing a final pixel scale of 0.252@xmath29 .",
    "the observations were carried out such that the source was always on chip1 .",
    "we used the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf)@xmath30 software for calibration and other image analysis .",
    "we performed the following analysis to generate x-1 s optical light curves :    \\1 ) basic data reduction : we first reduced the data through bias subtraction and flat fielding followed by the trimming of the vignetted regions of the images .",
    "\\2 ) data screening : x-1 s optical counterpart is faint with a v - band magnitude of 22.4as measured in the f547 m filter of hst ( gris et al . 2012 ) . we found that including images with seeing worse than 1@xmath29 resulted in unusually large error bars on the light curve measurements compared with the expected error bars from poisson statistics .",
    "we therefore removed images with seeing worse than this value from our analysis .",
    "\\3 ) image alignment : we aligned the images to a relative precision of @xmath31 10% of a pixel using the _",
    "software tools sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , scamp ( bertin 2006 ) , and swarp ( bertin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "\\4 ) image subtraction : we performed image subtraction using hotpants@xmath32 , which is a custom modification of the isis algorithm developed by alard & lupton ( 1998 ) .",
    "we validated the subtracted images by randomly selecting 1000 locations around x-1 and ensuring their light curves were all consistent with being constant .",
    "\\5 ) extract x-1 s optical light curve : finally , we extracted x-1 s light curve by performing aperture photometry on the subtracted images .",
    "we now discuss in detail each of the above steps .",
    "we first reduced all the images following the standard procedure of subtracting the bias followed by division by a bias subtracted , normalized flat field .",
    "we normalized the bias subtracted flat field by its mode value .",
    "we used the iraf tasks zerocombine and flatcombine to construct the median bias and the flat field images , respectively .",
    "after the initial calibration , we trimmed the vignetted regions of the images .      on the night of the 13@xmath26 the seeing ( point spread function s ( psf s ) fwhm ) varied between 0.5@xmath29 - 1.6@xmath29 with the seeing degrading towards the end of the night .",
    "after the screening criterion of excluding images with seeing worse than 1@xmath29 , we had 73 images of roughly 120 s exposure each .",
    "this gave us a total temporal baseline of 73@xmath6(120 + 27 ) s @xmath2 10.7 ks ( here 27 s refers to the image readout time ) .",
    "the airmass was below 2 all throughout the night .",
    "a sample image with the entire field of view ( chip 1 ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we first obtained the plate solution  using the iraf task ccmap  of an image taken halfway through the night of the 13@xmath26 .",
    "while the seeing worsened from the beginning to the end of the night , the airmass and the overall sky background ( due to the moon ) improved in a more or less monotonic fashion .",
    "therefore , the optimum image for extracting the sources was the one at the middle of the image stack . using 20 pointlike sources in the 2mass catalog , we were able to achieve an absolute astrometric accuracy of @xmath2 0.1@xmath29 ( @xmath2 0.07@xmath29 in both the ra and the declination coordinates ) .",
    "we then noticed that even the images taken on the same night were slightly misaligned with respect to each other by a fraction of a pixel to a few pixels , despite the fact that the telescope was not dithered between successive exposures .",
    "we corrected this as follows :    \\(a ) first , we extracted  using sextractor  the locations of various point sources in the reference image above with absolute astrometry .",
    "\\(b ) we then used scamp to obtain an astrometric solution for each image to match with the positions of point sources derived from the reference image in the above step .",
    "we only allowed for linear distortions , i.e. , the scamp parameter distort_degrees was set to 1 .",
    "\\(c ) finally , we used swarp to re - sample each image on a 1672@xmath6955 pixel grid as per the astrometric solution derived in the above step .",
    "in essence , we aligned every image with respect to the image in step ( a ) .",
    "the choice of the image in step ( a ) is not critical .",
    "we repeated the entire analysis with other images to find that the results are the same .",
    "we tested the accuracy of the image alignment by tracking the centroid positions(@xmath33,@xmath34)of a sample of stars in the aligned images .",
    "we used sextractor to estimate the centers of 20 point sources in all the 73 images after alignment . for the sake of convenience",
    ", we used the same point sources used for plate solution above .",
    "these stars are indicated by blue colored circles and referenced as a followed by a number in figure 1 .",
    "table 2 describes their wcs ( j2000 ) coordinates and the rms variation in units of fraction of a pixel after alignment .",
    "the observed rms variation of 3 - 12% suggests that the images are aligned to less than one - eighth of a pixel with respect to each other .      after aligning the images",
    ", we combined three consecutive images to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "we then employed hotpants to carry out image subtraction on these 24 ( 73 over 3 ) images .",
    "we only used a sub - region ( 350@xmath6350 pixels ) of these images to perform subtraction ( see figure 1 ) . to minimize psf variation across the field",
    ", we varied the size of the sub - region using trial - and - error and found that a region of size 350@xmath6350 pixels ( see figure 2 ) gave the best image subtraction .",
    "while we set the background order to 2 ( -bg 2 in hotpants ) and the kernel order to 0 ( -ko 0 in hotpants ) , the rest of the parameters were set to their default values . to be consistent , we always convolved with and normalized with respect to the template . the template  comprising of 31 images",
    " was extracted by averaging all the aligned images with seeing less than 0.55@xmath29 .",
    "the night of the 13@xmath26 had the best seeing conditions , hence the template image was constructed from images obtained on this night only .",
    "we also tested the image subtraction analysis with a template constructed from 35 images with seeing better than 0.65@xmath29 from the night of the 12@xmath26 ( a template independent of feb 13@xmath26 data ) .",
    "the resulting ulx light curve was similar within the error bars .",
    "a sample image before and after subtraction is shown in the top left and the top right panels of figure 2 , respectively .",
    "we performed aperture photometry at 1000 randomly sampled locations around the ulx ( see appendix a for aperture photometry methodology and error estimation ) .",
    "we avoided regions close to saturated stars . by choosing such a large number of points we ensured to sample the entire region within plus or minus 100 pixels around the ulx .",
    "we then modeled each of these relative background light curves with a constant model which yielded a reduced @xmath35 between 0.5 - 1.5 providing confidence in the image subtraction procedure .",
    "seven of the sample background light curves are shown in the bottom left panel of figure 2 .    moreover ,",
    "if the image subtraction was successful , the pixel values in the image should be distributed symmetrically around some mean value .",
    "figure 3 shows histograms of pixel values around x-1 ( excluding saturated stars ) from three different subtracted images .",
    "the histograms were constructed from a square region of width 100 pixels centered on the ulx .",
    "we excluded the ulx aperture of 6@xmath66 pixels centered on the ulx from these histogram calculations .",
    "it is clear that these histograms are symmetric and again validate the image subtraction procedure .",
    "we first performed aperture photometry at the ulx s location in all the subtracted images .",
    "this gave us x-1 s count rates ( e@xmath36/s ) relative to the template image ( @xmath37@xmath0@xmath38 , @xmath39=1 ... 23 ) .",
    "we then extracted x-1 s count rate in the template used for image subtraction ( @xmath40@xmath0@xmath41 ) .",
    "x-1 s observed count rate was then estimated as the sum @xmath37 + @xmath40 .",
    "the uncertainties on these rates were calculated as the sum in quadrature of @xmath38 and @xmath41 .",
    "x-1 s normalized optical light curve ( fraction of its mean count rate ) from the night of the 13@xmath26 is shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 . within the error bars , x-1 s optical light curve is consistent with being constant giving a @xmath35 of 20 for 23 dof , when modeled with a constant .",
    "following the same procedure as described above ( section 3.1.1  3.1.5 ) we constructed x-1 s normalized optical light curves from the nights of the 12@xmath26 and the 14@xmath26 .",
    "these are shown in figure 5 and they are also consistent with being constant within the measured error bars . the best - fit constant model yielded @xmath35/dof of 6/17 and 18/23 for the data on the 12@xmath26 and 14@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "note the larger error bar on the 14@xmath26 due to higher level of sky background .    on the night of the 12@xmath26 we observed a standard star field ( ngc 2268 ) for @xmath2 3 s in the g@xmath42high filter at an airmass of 1.02 .",
    "using a few bright , unsaturated stars in this image , we estimated based on the stetson catalog@xmath43 the photometric zero - point count rate of the ccd to be ( 8.68@xmath00.36)@xmath610@xmath44 e@xmath36/s . the vlt / fors2 g_high filter is close to the sdss g@xmath45 band . using the filter transformations of lupton ( 2005)@xmath46 we estimated the mean v - band magnitude of ngc 5408 x-1 s optical counterpart on the 12@xmath26 , the 13@xmath26 , and the 14@xmath26 to be 22.523@xmath00.014 , 22.539@xmath00.015 , and 22.563@xmath00.016 , respectively .",
    "since the quoted error bars only take into account the statistical uncertainty , the true uncertainty in the zero - point  including the systematic uncertainty  is likely larger than this .",
    "nevertheless , these values are consistent with prior studies of this object ( kaaret & corbel 2009 ; gris et al .",
    "x-1 s template count rate was estimated to be 80.2@xmath01.3 e@xmath36/s . as a sanity check",
    ", we compared this value to the expected count rate using the vlt / fors2 online exposure time calculator ( etc)@xmath47 .",
    "the observed values are consistent with the values estimated by the etc .    in order to investigate if x-1 s optical counterpart varied on a timescale of @xmath2 24 hours , we first estimated its mean count rate on each night .",
    "we then divided each of those by the mean over three nights to extract a normalized count rate for each night .",
    "similarly , we estimated the normalized count rate of a sample of seven nearby point sources .",
    "the rms scatter in the normalized count rates of the field stars  on each night  was added as an additional uncertainty to x-1 s normalized light curve measurement .",
    "the final long - term light curve of x-1 is shown in figure 6 . since the evidence for variability on an @xmath2 day timescale is only significant at the 3@xmath1 level ,",
    "we consider it to be marginal .",
    "the amount of variability in a light curve can be quantified using the so - called normalized excess variance ( @xmath48 ; edelson et al .",
    "2002 ; vaughan et al .",
    "the fractional root - mean - squared ( rms ) amplitude is simply @xmath49 at the @xmath50-sigma level , a source is considered to be variable only if @xmath48",
    "@xmath51 @xmath50@xmath6err(@xmath48 ) , where err(@xmath48 ) is the error on the normalized excess variance . using the analytical expression for err(@xmath48 ) derived by vaughan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we estimate a 3-@xmath1 upper limit on x-1 s fractional rms optical variability on the 12@xmath26 , the 13@xmath26 , and the 14@xmath26 to be 3.3% , 4.8% , and 5.6% , respectively .",
    "for this study , we only used data acquired on 2014 february 13 by the european photon imaging camera ( epic ; both pn and mos ) on board _ xmm - newton_. we used the latest standard analysis system ( xmmsas ) version 14.0.0 to reduce the images , and extract the filtered epic event lists .",
    "all the event lists were screened with a standard filter of ( pattern @xmath52 4 ) , to include only the single and the double pixel events , and events in the complete band pass of 0.3 - 10.0 kev were considered for further analysis .",
    "x-1 s mean x - ray count rate was 1.288@xmath00.006 counts s@xmath53 . to be able to compare with the optical light curve",
    "we show the normalized x - ray light curve from 2014 february 13 ( simultaneous with the optical observations ) in the top panel of figure 4 . to test for variability we modeled the x - ray light curve with a constant .",
    "this yielded a @xmath54 of 381 for 72 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "this suggests that a constant model is strongly disfavored which is in agreement with earlier studies ( e.g. , dheeraj & strohmayer 2012 ; caballero - garca et al .",
    "2013 , etc ) . to quantify the variability , we calculated the normalized excess variance ( @xmath48 ) and the fractional root - mean - squared ( rms ) amplitude following vaughan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . using a light curve bin size of 440 s as in the optical light curve",
    ", we estimate the fractional rms amplitude in x - rays to be 9.0@xmath00.5% .",
    "to search for a reverberation signal we evaluated the discrete cross correlation function ( dcf ; edelson et al .",

    "there is no evidence for a statistically significant correlation between the x - ray and the optical variability .",
    "we estimated the dcf s error bars and the significance contours following these steps :    \\1 ) first , we constructed @xmath55 = 10@xmath56 synthetic x - ray and optical light curves .",

    "assuming for each time stamp in the measured light curve  the count rates are gaussian distributed with a mean equal to the measured count rate and a standard deviation , @xmath1 , equal to the error bar .",

    "the error bar at a given lag was then estimated to be twice the standard deviation in the dcf measurement within these @xmath55 values .",
    "in essence , an error bar at a given lag bin represents 4@xmath1 deviations .",
    "\\3 ) finally , we estimated the 3 and the 4@xmath1 confidence contours on the dcf using model - independent monte carlo simulations as follows :    @xmath57 for each of the synthetic optical light curves derived in step 1 , we randomized the count rate values but retained the time stamps .",
    "@xmath57 we then calculated the dcf between these randomized synthetic optical light curves and a synthetic x - ray light curve .",
    "the time stamps of the synthetic x - ray light curve were kept the same ( null hypothesis ) .",
    "@xmath57 after repeating the above two steps @xmath55 number of times we estimated  for each lag3@xmath1 and 4@xmath1 significance levels .",
    "it can be seen from figure 4 that both the x - ray and the optical light curves are regularly sampled for the most part .",
    "there are only a few segments of the light curves where data was unevenly sampled .",
    "after interpolating at these handful of data points , we constructed the regular cross correlation function ( ccf ) using the idl function c_correlate .",
    "the corresponding ccf is shown in the right panel of figure 7 .",
    "we set the lag limits to ensure that the entire optical light curve is within the bounds of the x - ray light curve .",
    "thus , the maximum and the minimum lags were set to 15000 s and -7500 s , respectively . in this scheme",
    ", a positive lag would imply that the optical lags the x - ray and _ vice versa for a negative lag_. as expected , the regular ccf ( right panel of figure 7 ) is very similar to the dcf ( left panel of figure 7 ) .",
    "the error bars and the confidence contours were extracted using the same model - independent monte carlo methodology as described for the dcf .",
    "again , the ccf indicates that there are no statistically significant features in the ccf .",
    "timing studies of stellar - mass black hole binaries using simultaneous x - ray and optical / uv monitoring have found two main types of correlated behavior : ( 1 ) straightforward reprocessing lags where the optical emission is correlated with the x - ray but delayed by a time - scale consistent with the light travel time to reprocessing sites within the binary system , and ( 2 ) complex , non - reprocessing time lags where the optical emission can lead the x - rays ( see , gandhi et al .",
    "2008 ; durant et al . 2008 ; motch et al . 1983 , 1985 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "indeed , it appears that both processes can be present together with the non - reprocessing lags becoming dominant at time - scales much shorter than the expected light travel time delays ( gandhi et al .",
    "further , evidence suggests that synchrotron emission from the jet may be responsible for this fastest , correlated variability seen to date in black hole systems ( hynes et al .",
    "2003 ; kanbach et al . 2001 ) .",
    "for the purposes of mass estimates from reverberation mapping one strictly requires the first type of correlated variability .",
    "the most clear - cut examples of such reprocessing are provided by simultaneous optical / x - ray observations of thermonuclear x - ray bursts from accreting neutron stars ( see mcclintock et al . 1979 ; pedersen et al .",
    "1982 ; hynes et al .",
    "however , reprocessing time - scales ( optical lagging the x - ray ) have now also been measured from a handful of stellar - mass black holes including gx 339 - 4 ( gandhi et al .",
    "2010 ) , gro j1655 - 40 ( hynes et al . 1998 ; obrien et al .",
    "2002 ) , xte j1118 + 480 ( hynes et al .",
    "2003 ) , and _ swift _ j1753.5 - 0127 ( hynes et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the time lags measured in these cases ( @xmath2 5 - 20 s ) are broadly consistent with their binary separations and expected accretion disk sizes . in the case of gro j1655 - 40 the inferred lag of @xmath58 s ( obrien et al . 2002 )",
    "can be combined with the measured widths of double - peaked heii ( 4686 @xmath27 ) lines arising in the accretion disk ( soria et al .",
    "2000 ) to arrive at a mass estimate based on equation ( 1 ) .",
    "taking half the peak separation of @xmath59 km s@xmath53 for the heii lines measured in 1996 june by soria et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as representative of velocities in the disk , one obtains a mass estimate of @xmath60 that is consistent with the mass measurements based on the radial velocity curve for gro j1655 - 40 ( beer & podsiadlowski 2002 ; greene et al .",
    "this provides a basic consistency check that the method can provide reliable mass estimates .    on timescales relevant to reverberation",
    ", black hole binaries typically show optical fractional variability levels ( rms ) in the range from @xmath61 ( hynes et al .",
    "1998 ; gandhi 2009 ) .",
    "assuming x-1 has a mass greater than @xmath62 ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2009 ; cseh et al .",
    "2013 ) , the corresponding range of lag time - scales expected is of the order of 1000 s. we did not detect statistically significant variability from x-1 on such time - scales , and our @xmath63 upper limit of 3.3% is roughly consistent with the lower half of the optical rms amplitude range quoted above . if x-1 were varying in the optical closer to the high end of this range then we would have likely detected such variability .",
    "evidence of absorption - like dips in the x - ray flux from x-1 is suggestive of a high inclination ( pasham & strohmayer 2013 ; gris et al .",
    "2013 ) , and it is conceivable that a high inclination could reduce the reprocessing response compared to a lower inclination system ( see , for example , figure 3 of obrien et al .",
    "2002 ) . moreover , during reprocessing in x - ray binaries ,",
    "the typical value of the ratio of the fractional rms variability amplitude of the x - rays to the optical is roughly 5 ( e.g. , see hynes et al .",
    "1998 ; obrien et al . 2002 ) . assuming",
    "a similar ratio for x-1 , the expected rms optical variability is roughly 2% ( 9/5 ) .",
    "this is still a factor of two lower than the fractional rms upper limit we reached with the vlt data on the 13@xmath26 ( 4.8% ) .",
    "while this first attempt at measuring an optical / x - ray reverberation lag in x-1 was unsuccessful , it has `` bounded '' the problem and demonstrated what is required for success .",
    "our best limits were achieved on the night of 12@xmath26 february and corresponded to times of lowest sky background ( largest moon angles ) .",
    "these observations are particularly challenging because of the need to simultaneously satisfy several observing constraints .",
    "first , the target must be visible from the optical telescope at low to modest airmass values , while also being simultaneously observable with _ xmm - newton_. second , for optimum sensitivity the moon should also be below the horizon to limit the sky background .",
    "for these observations we achieved the first constraint , but not the latter .",
    "moreover , assuming the lag time - scale is @xmath31000 s , then significantly more simultaneous x - ray / optical data is desirable than over a single night .",
    "it should be possible to achieve sensitivity to variability at the few percent level if all the above constraints can be satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , even if the observing constraints are satisfied , ground - based optical observations remain at the mercy of weather and seeing conditions , and for this reason hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations may provide a better solution .    finally , we reiterate that the time resolution and the overall temporal baseline of the optical and the x - ray light curves set the lower and the upper limits on the black hole masses that can be probed with the reverberation technique proposed here . with the current optical telescopes , ulx optical counterparts require exposures on the order of hundred seconds to reach the signal - to - noise to detect a reverberation signal . thus with current technology",
    ", this method is more sensitive to imbhs than stellar - mass black holes .",
    "however , the mass range can be extended to stellar - mass black holes with the next generation telescopes such as the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) .",
