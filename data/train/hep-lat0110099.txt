    "the aim of this contribution is to illustrate the method of constrained curve fitting by application to three - point functions describing the semileptonic decay of heavy - light mesons . for a discussion of the method see @xcite .",
    "the constraint method offers the chance to include knowledge about the fit parameters and generally results in very stable fits .",
    "this allows for much more ambitious fits than previous methods and the results are less prone to systematic errors from fitting .",
    "we apply the method to the subset ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) of the data analysed in @xcite , where nrqcd is used for the heavy quark .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath3 .",
    "the smearings used are a gaussian with a radius of @xmath4 for the heavy and local for the light quark ( referred to as smearing  1 ) and @xmath5 for both ( smearing   2 ) .",
    "all combinations of these smearings at source and sink were used .",
    "it has been demonstrated that these are not the optimal smearings @xcite , in particular for nonvanishing momenta , which leaves room for improvement of the results presented here .",
    "we aim at extracting the form factors @xmath6 from the matrix elements    @xmath7    for the elastic case @xmath8 with degenerate masses @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the leading order heavy - heavy current for nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "first we extract the form factors for each value of @xmath11 .",
    "we fit the two - point functions parametrised by    @xmath12    simultaneously with the three - point functions using the ansatz    @xmath13    with current matrix elements @xmath14 , where @xmath15 label the smearings and @xmath16 the energy levels .",
    "we set @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is @xmath6 .",
    "the distance between quark source and sink is @xmath19 . instead of the energies we in fact used as parameters the logs of energy differences as in @xcite .",
    "our standard priors are @xmath20 for the ground state energy for the fit parameter @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the energy differences between the excitations .",
    "the first is known from previous fits ; the excitation energy priors are appropriate to typical radial excitations at this lattice spacing . for the amplitudes we took as priors @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the ground states , @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the rest .",
    "these are based on experience from previous fits but allow for plenty of variation ( the typical errors on the amplitudes from the fits are @xmath28 ) .",
    "the priors for the @xmath14 are @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath14 @xmath32 .",
    "the minimisation was done using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "the value of @xmath33 for the reliable fits ( i.e. using a sufficient number of exponentials ) is generally about @xmath34 .",
    "the contribution of the two - point functions is very small ( as the examples in @xcite ) , the priors contribute only marginally .",
    "quoted errors are extracted from the curvature matrix .",
    "figure  [ fig:3pt ] shows a typical fit result for the three - point functions . to shed light on the effect of the priors we repeated the calculation with priors away from the expectations and allowing for smaller deviations .",
    "we find that the data strongly constrain the lowest lying current matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath35 , but have little information about the higher ones .",
    "this is expected because off - diagonal matrix elements should be , and are , small , because they represent the overlap ( as @xmath36 ) of orthogonal states .",
    "the dependence of the lowest currents on the number of exponentials in the fit is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : currents_vs_exps ] .",
    "stability sets in for six exponentials .",
    "to convert these form factors into @xmath6 one needs the kinetic masses .",
    "they are calculated from the energy splittings @xmath37 between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states @xmath40    our method permits us to extract them directly from simultaneous fits of the respective smeared - smeared two - point functions .",
    "this is an example where the usage of the classical fitting method could be misleading if one considers the two - point functions separately , because the two - point functions seem to plateau much earlier than their ratio .",
    "the values for the kinetic masses for the three heavy quark masses investigated are listed in the following table :    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + this much simpler fit shows stable results already using three exponentials ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mkin_vs_exps ] ) .    in the future",
    "we plan to fit simultaneously all the two- and three - point functions at different momenta and the kinetic mass will then come directly from the same fits that give the current matrix elements .",
    "now we can plot the form factors as function of @xmath41 , the isgur - wise function  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isgurwise ] ) .",
    "the errors are half of those from using only one smearing .",
    "each dataset extrapolates to the point @xmath42 as it has to for nrqcd .",
    "there seems to be a tendency of increasing slope with the heavy quark mass which has to be explored further .",
