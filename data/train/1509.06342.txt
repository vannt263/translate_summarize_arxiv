    "the interest in iridates grows fueled by the prospect of discovering novel electronic and/or topological orders that emerge from the interplay of spin - orbit coupling and electron correlations .",
    "sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 is an archetypal example of such new phases , exhibiting a mott gap and a distinct spin - orbital entangled magnetic structure @xcite .",
    "although sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 has been studied since the early 90 s in connection to high temperature superconducting cuprates @xcite , the important role of spin - orbit coupling had not been appreciated then . from recent studies of electronic and magnetic excitation spectra ,",
    "it is now well understood that the insulating nature of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 is due to strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite , suppression of which results in a metallic phase in sr@xmath0rho@xmath1 @xcite , a 4@xmath4 counterpart of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .    the magnetic structure and dynamics of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1",
    "are now reasonably well understood within the theoretical framework in the strong spin - orbit coupling limit described in terms of the @xmath5 - 1/2 kramers doublet .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath5 - 1/2 isospins allow rich expressions of magnetic coupling depending on the lattice and bonding geometry , ranging from isotropic heisenberg interaction to a bond - directional , ising - like interaction @xcite .",
    "the latter provides a basis for implementing exotic quantum magnets inspired by the kitaev model @xcite .",
    "the former surprisingly indicates that a system with very strong spin - orbit coupling can mimic a system without it .",
    "experimentally , it has been confirmed that the canted antiferromagnetic structure of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 derives from a predominantly isotropic nearest - neighbor magnetic exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "thus , sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 becomes the first non - cuprate material to realize a ( iso)spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet in a quasi - two - dimensional square lattice  a possible platform for high temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "most recently , tantalizing indications of @xmath4-wave superconductivity have been seen in electron - doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 @xcite : a gap of predominantly @xmath4-wave symmetry is observed in the low - temperature angle - resolved photoemission spectra @xcite , and a particle - hole symmetric density of states is observed in scanning tunneling spectra below a temperature as high as 50 k @xcite . above this temperature , the @xmath4-wave gap evolves into a pseudogap , in striking parallel with the cuprates @xcite .",
    "however , because of the inherently surface sensitive nature of the technique used to dope the sample in these studies , involving in situ deposition of alkali metal atoms on the surface of undoped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , it remains unclear at this point whether the @xmath4-wave gap originates from superconductivity without evidence from bulk measurements .",
    "at least , these results indicate that highly nontrivial electronic phases emerge from doping a `` spin - orbit '' mott insulator .",
    "the more traditional method of chemical doping @xcite through , for example , substitution of sr by la , has proven much more difficult than in cuprates .",
    "la - doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 single crystals have only become available in the last couple of years @xcite , but angle - resolved photoemission studies on them @xcite do not fully reproduce the observations made via the in situ doping method @xcite . while it is unclear at the moment what leads to such differences between the two doping methods , we note that a well - defined quasiparticle peak is absent for any doping level in la - doped samples , indicating suppressed coherent motion of doped electrons presumably due to disorder created by chemical doping .",
    "moreover , we note that previous studies on the parent sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and its sister compounds have shown significant variations in the magnetic properties even without doping , likely reflecting different defect concentrations @xcite .",
    "for example , the sizable @xmath6-axis component of the uniform magnetic susceptibility is not understood and seems incompatible with the known magnetic structure of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the diamagnetism initially reported for sr@xmath2ir@xmath0o@xmath3 is completely unexplained and is absent in samples grown under different conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe it is imperative to establish the intrinsic magnetic properties through growth of stoichiometric single crystals of the parent iridates before the doping - induced phenomena can be fully explored .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the synthesis and characterization of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "synthesis of stoichiometric single crystals was achieved using the flux method , and characterizations were performed using magnetization , x - ray diffraction , raman scattering , and optical conductivity measurements .",
    "we find that the magnetic response depends very sensitively on subtle details of the growth condition . through energy",
    "dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) , optical spectroscopy , and raman scattering , we infer that oxygen vacancies are the likely culprit of the divergent properties reported for sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , by systematic variation of the growth temperature , we are able to introduce , in a controlled way , layers of sr@xmath2ir@xmath0o@xmath3 into the bulk sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "our results thus emphasize that revealing the intrinsic magnetic properties of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and related materials requires careful attention the oxygen stoichiometry .",
    "single crystals were grown using the flux method .",
    "powders of iro@xmath7 , srco@xmath8 , and srcl@xmath7@xmath96h@xmath0o were thoroughly mixed and placed in a platinum crucible covered with a lid .",

    "crystals were separated from the residual flux by rinsing out with distilled water .",
    "the crystals were found to have a regular shape with a large flat shiny surface with lengths up to few mm .",

    "the magnetization measurements were carried out using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( mpms squid vsm , quantum design ) .",
    "the low temperature raman scattering experiments were performed in the backscattering geometry using a jobinyvon labram hr800 spectrometer and the 632.8 nm excitation line of a hene laser was used .",
    "the power of the laser beam was 1.5 mw and the diameter of the beam @xmath11 .",

    "all of the data presented in this paper were taken with the light propagation direction along the crystalline @xmath6-axis ; hence only the polarization orientations will be specified .",
    "crystals were cleaved @xmath13-situ to obtain a fresh clean surface . the far infrared ( fir ) ellipsometric measurements were carried out on a home - built ellipsometer attached to a bruker 66v / s ft - ir spectrometer located at the ir1 beamline of the anka synchrotron at kit , germany .",

    "<S> we assess the defect concentration based on magnetization , x - ray diffraction , raman scattering , and optical conductivity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we find that samples with a low concentration of electronically active defects show much reduced in - gap spectral weight in the optical conductivity and a pronounced two - magnon peak in the raman scattering spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> a prolonged exposure at high temperature during the growth leads to higher defect concentration likely due to creation of oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate a systematic intergrowth of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and sr@xmath2ir@xmath0o@xmath3 phases by varying the growth temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus emphasize that revealing the intrinsic magnetic properties of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and related materials requires a scrupulous control of the crystal growth process . </S>"
