    "recently the evidences of neutrino oscillations are strongly supported by both of the atmospheric  @xcite and the solar neutrino experiments   @xcite .",
    "the former suggests an almost maximal lepton flavor mixing between the 2nd and the 3rd generations , while the favorable solution to the solar neutrino deficits is given by large mixing angle solution between the 1st and the 2nd generations ( lma , low or vo )  @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments indicate that the neutrinos have tiny but finite masses , with two mass squared differences @xmath9 . however , we can not know the absolute values of the neutrinos masses from the oscillation experiments .",
    "recently , a paper@xcite announces the evidence of the neutrinoless double @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) decay .",
    "this paper suggests @xmath10 this results is very exciting .",
    "it is because @xmath11 decay experiments could tell us about the absolute value of the neutrino masses , while neutrino oscillation experiments show only mass squared differences of neutrinos .",
    "the evidence for @xmath11 decay also means neutrinos are the majorana particles and the lepton number is violated , since @xmath11 decay can not occur in the case of dirac neutrinos .",
    "this evidence is also closely related to the recent topics of the cosmology such as the dark matter candidate of universe@xcite .",
    "the tiny neutrino masses and the lepton flavor mixings have been discussed in a lot of models beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the most promising ideas is that light neutrinos are constructed as majorana particles in the low energy , such as the see - saw mechanism@xcite .",
    "here we are concentrating on the light majorana neutrinos which masses are induced by the dimension five operators in the low energy effective yukawa interactions .    in this paper , we will estimate the magnitude of @xmath1 decay in the classification of the neutrino mass hierarchy patterns as type a , @xmath2 , type b , @xmath3 , and type c , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the @xmath6-th generation neutrino absolute mass @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1 decay strongly depends on the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "we will analyze the value of @xmath12 in the parameter space of the majorana @xmath8 phases , and search the region of being consistent with the data of @xmath1 decay experiment .",
    "before starting our discussions , let us show the notations of neutrino masses and their mixing angles . since we would like",
    "to be concentrating on the low energy mass matrix of majorana neutrinos , we add the dimension five operator to the standard model in the lepton sector as , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the coefficient of the dimension five operator , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath6-th generation lepton doublet and charged lepton singlet with @xmath17 , respectively , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are higgs doublets . ) by the supersymmetric forms , the results in this paper do not depend on whether the model is supersymmetric or not . ]",
    "the light neutrinos obtain masses from the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath20 as @xmath21 the energy scale of @xmath22 suggests the scale of the new physics and the lepton number violation . in the diagonal base of the charged lepton sector , the light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath23 , is diagonalized by @xmath24 as @xmath25 here the matrix @xmath26 is so - called mns matrix@xcite denoted by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ckm-_like _ matrix , which contains one @xmath8-phase ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 contains two extra majorana phases ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 for the latter convenience , we introduce the matrix @xmath34    table [ table ] shows the results from the recent neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .    .",
