    "experimental discovery of resonance kondo tunneling through quantum dots under strong coulomb blockade @xcite is an impressive recent result in the physics of nanostructures .",
    "the observation of kondo - like zero bias anomaly in the tunneling current through planar gaas / gaalas quantum dot ( qd ) with odd electron occupation and a net spin @xmath6 confirmed earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "a natural question then arose whether the kondo tunneling is possible when the number of electrons in the dot is even , so that the nominal spin of an isolated qd is zero .",
    "some experimental data were consistent with the occurrence of kondo resonance also in that case @xcite .",
    "of course , the simple reason for kondo scattering in this case is the triplet ground state which can be realized provided the exchange interaction compensates the energy @xmath7 of excitation of one electron from the last doubly occupied state .",
    "another compensation mechanism is the zeeman splitting of excited triplet state in external in - plane magnetic field @xmath8 @xcite . in this case kondo resonance in electron tunneling",
    "should be observed at a specific value of zeeman energy @xmath9 . unlike the conventional kondo mechanism",
    ", this effect arises under a condition of broken rotational invariance in spin space , and the tunneling induced singlet - triplet mixing is shown to be the source of kondo - like resonance .",
    "the experimental observation of kondo tunneling in even coulomb blockade windows at @xmath10 t in qd formed in nanotube @xcite confirmed these theoretical predictions .",
    "another interesting possibility of realization of kondo tunneling in qd with even electron occupation arises when the low - energy part of its spectrum consists of spin singlet , spin triplet and singlet charge transfer exciton @xcite .",
    "it was shown in the above paper that such spectrum arises in double quantum dots ( dqd ) provided this kind of nanostructure consists of two wells of different depth and the tunneling is allowed only through the `` shallow '' well with larger radius and smaller coulomb charging energy @xmath11 . in this case , the singlet - triplet crossover is an _ intrinsic _ property of nanoobject in a contact with metallic leads , which arises even at zero magnetic field .",
    "this artificial molecule has a natural prototype : the low - energy part of the electron spectrum of complex molecules in which a rare - earth ion is secluded in a carbon cage has the above mentioned structure provided the covalent chemical bonds exist between the @xmath12-electron of a rare - earth ion and @xmath13-electrons of carbon cage .",
    "cerocene ce(c@xmath14h@xmath14)@xmath15 is a known example of such double - shell molecule @xcite .",
    "being adsorbed on a metallic substrate this molecule is expected to demonstrate the kondo - type behavior .",
    "in the present research we study the tunneling through dqd formed by two dots of nearly equal radii in a parallel geometry ( fig.1 ) with two separate gates generating voltages @xmath16 .",
    "such setups were fabricated several years ago @xcite .    if only one of the tunnel channels ( say , left ) between the dot and the lead is open ( the inter - dot tunneling @xmath17 , the tunnel coupling between the right dot and the leads @xmath18 ) , we are left with the `` electrometer '' configuration when the tunneling through the left well is controlled by the charge state in the right well .",
    "the coulomb blockade windows between the resonances in the coulomb energy of the dot @xmath19 form a honeycomb pattern where the vertices connect the windows with charge configurations @xmath20 .",
    "the lines @xmath21 are the regions where the coulomb resonance induced by @xmath22 allows tunneling through the left dot @xcite .",
    "we consider the tunneling through dqd where the source ",
    "drain current is allowed only through the left dot , but the tunnel coupling with the right dot controls the spin degrees of freedom of the dqd .",
    "the case of dqd occupied by two electrons in its ground state is studied assuming that both left and right dots are neutral at @xmath23 then the isolated dqd under strong coulomb blockade conditions reminds , in some respect , the hydrogen molecule in the heitler - london approximation .",
    "this system is described by a generalized anderson tunneling hamiltonian @xmath24 here the quantized energy levels of electrons in the dots @xmath25 are biased by the gate voltages , the coulomb blockade energies are assumed to be the same for both dots , @xmath26 ,  @xmath27 are the band energies of the electrons in the leads , @xmath28 stands for electrons from the source and drain electrodes , @xmath29 ,   @xmath30    we are interested in the case when the artificial heitler - london molecule is strongly biased by the gate voltages so that @xmath31 , but still @xmath32 ( fig.2 ) .    in this case the dot hamiltonian ( first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) ) may be easily diagonalized , and the lowest three levels are @xmath33 the small parameter is @xmath34 expressed in terms of the coupling parameters entering the hamiltonian ( [ 1.1 ] ) ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the gate voltage @xmath35 is applied in such a way that the spin and charge degrees of freedom are nearly separate in isolated dqd , i.e. the energy of charge transfer exciton @xmath36 substantially exceeds the energy of spin exciton @xmath37 .",
    "if the tunnel coupling between the dqd and the metallic leads is also small , @xmath38 , only the singlet - triplet excitations are involved in forming the tunnel transparency of the left dot . in spite of the occurrence of singlet ground state , the kondo - like processes involving the triplet exciton are possible , and one can expect the corresponding anomalies provided the characteristic kondo temperature @xmath39 is comparable with the energy @xmath40 of singlet - triplet excitation in dqd @xcite . to study the low - energy anomalies we use the haldane - anderson renormalization group ( rg ) approach @xcite . according to this method the hamiltonian ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "diagonalized in accordance with ( [ 2.3 ] ) is rescaled by absorbing the high - energy excitations of order @xmath41 ( where @xmath41 is the width of conduction band ) in the renormalized parameters of this hamiltonian at reduced @xmath42 .",
    "it is known that one can neglect renormalization of the tunneling constant @xmath43 in comparison with rescaling of the energy levels @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the scaling equations are @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the tunnel coupling constants @xmath48 are _ different _ for singlet and triplet states because the singlet exciton ( @xmath49 is the density of states in the leads ) . in other words ,",
    "the doubly occupied right dot state @xmath50 is admixed to the bare singlet @xmath51 by inter - dot tunneling , whereas the triplet states @xmath52 are not affected by this tunneling , @xmath53 as a result @xmath54 due to this relation the scaling trajectories @xmath55 determined by the scaling invariants for eq .",
    "( [ 3.6 ] ) may intersect at a point @xmath56 estimated as @xmath57 according to numerical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , this level crossing can occur either before or after the crossover to a schrieffer - wolff regime when the one - electron energies @xmath58 exceed the half - width of reduced continuum band , @xmath59 . in both cases",
    "the charge degrees of freedom are quenched for the excitation energy within the interval @xmath60 .",
    "then , integrating out the residual charge excitations ( tunneling transitions to the states with one and three electrons in the dqd ) one comes to an effective hamiltonian including only spin degrees of freedom , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is a configuration change operator , @xmath65 includes the above rg operation , @xmath66 are the states inside the reduced conduction band .    unlike conventional schrieffer - wolff hamiltonian for a local spin that arises as a result of rg procedure @xcite , the effective hamiltonian ( [ 3.9 ] ) contains also the singlet term with renormalized energy @xmath67 and the effective interaction with coupling constant @xmath68 intermixing singlet and triplet states of dqd .",
    "the coupling constants are connected by the relations @xmath69 .",
    "this means that the heitler - london type dqd possesses the symmetry of a _ spin rotator _",
    ", i.e. that its algebra @xmath70 is described by two vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 with spherical components @xmath71 obeying the commutation relations @xmath72   = ie_{jkl}s_l,~[p_j , p_k]=ie_{jkl}s_l,~ [ p_j , s_k]=ie_{jkl}p_l\\ ] ] ( @xmath73 are cartesian coordinates ) .",
    "these vectors are orthogonal , @xmath74 and the casimir operator is @xmath75 in terms of these operators the interaction term in the effective hamiltonian acquires a symmetric form , @xmath76 where the local electron operators are defined as @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the pauli matrix ) .",
    "if the inequality @xmath79 is satisfied , the triplet becomes the lowest state of the dqd , i.e. , @xmath80 , and a kondo screening for @xmath81 should emerge .",
    "however , the anderson - type scaling equations for the parameters @xmath82 involve both @xmath83 and @xmath68 . in dimensionless variables",
    "@xmath84 these equations are written as @xmath85,~~ dj_2/d\\ln d = -2j_1j_2 .",
    "\\label{3.13}\\ ] ]    such quasi degeneracy of triplet and singlet states was discussed previously in relation to the physics of tunneling through vertical quantum dots @xcite , planar qd occupied by even number of electrons @xcite and strongly asymmetric dqd containing two dots of essentially different radii @xcite . in the first two cases",
    "the singlet - triplet degeneracy is induced by an external magnetic field , while in the third case the asymmetry is an intrinsic property of the dqd . in the case under consideration here",
    ", the desired asymmetry is induced by the asymmetric gate voltage .",
    "analysis of the scaling equations ( [ 3.13 ] ) shows that both @xmath3 and @xmath4 operators are involved in anomalous kondo scattering in a case when @xmath86 .",
    "then the scaling equations ( [ 3.13 ] ) are reduced to a single equation for the reduced exchange parameter @xmath87 @xmath88 with a fixed point at @xmath89 and the kondo temperature @xmath90 .",
    "this is a kondo temperature of a spin rotator , having the rotational symmetry @xmath91 .",
    "the spin symmetry of dqd is reduced together with the kondo temperature in the case @xmath92 .",
    "then the singlet - triplet coupling @xmath93 is quenched at energies @xmath94 , so the low - energy spectrum is determined by the @xmath81 triplet state .",
    "the kondo temperature at large @xmath95 is a function of @xmath95 which obeys the law @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a universal numerical constant @xcite .",
    "the kondo - type zero bias anomaly in conductance arises when @xmath98 and the dqd is in a state with s=1 .",
    "it growth with temperature as @xmath99 $ ] for @xmath100 and as @xmath101 $ ] for @xmath102 . at @xmath103",
    "the conductance tends to the unitarity limit @xmath104 .",
    "thus one arrives at the following picture of rearrangement of the low - energy spectrum of dqd occupied by two electrons in a parallel geometry ( fig.1 ) under external bias . in a symmetric case",
    "@xmath105 the isolated system possesses an axial symmetry and a singlet ground state ( heitler - london type artificial molecule ) .",
    "its spin spectrum consists of singlet - triplet excitations , and the singlet state is stabilized by the indirect exchange energy @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "two singlet charge excitons ( even and odd ) corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric combination of the polar states @xmath107 @xmath108 are separated by a large energy gap @xmath11 from the spin exciton .",
    "the level renormalization ( [ 3.6 ] ) is the same for the singlet and triplet states because the charge transfer excitations are axially symmetric in this case .",
    "the only possibility to open a kondo channel is achievable by a trivial switching off the interdot tunneling @xmath109 .",
    "then the singlet - triplet gap also tends to zero , and when it becomes less than @xmath39 for the left dot , the latter behaves as conventional @xmath6 qd with odd occupation .",
    "the axial symmetry is broken when @xmath110 , and the `` right '' exciton @xmath111 then softens ( fig .",
    "the system acquires the symmetry of a spin rotator described by the semi - simple lie group @xmath91 with triplet exciton mixed with the singlet ground state due to the tunneling interaction with the leads . when the condition ( [ 3.6a ] ) and the inequality @xmath112 are valid , the ground state of dqd becomes a triplet and it behaves as an under - screened @xmath81 kondo center with zero bias anomaly of the conductance .",
    "thus , the charge excitations in the right dot that is not involved directly in the source - drain tunneling can drive the spin excitations in the left dot and induce the kondo resonance in a dqd with even occupation .",
