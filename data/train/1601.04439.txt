    "the simplest standard unified models postulate that the diversity of observed properties of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) can be largely explained as a viewing angle effect and anisotropic nuclear obscuration ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a key ingredient of these orientation - based models is an optically- and geometrically - thick toroidal structure located on tens of parsec scales that obscures the agn nuclear region ( accretion disk and x - ray corona ) and the broad line region from certain lines - of - sight . for the sake of simplicity we will refer to this structure as the ` torus ' .",
    "orientation - based unified models of tori with homogeneous dust distributions propose that agn are optically classified as type 1 if they are observed at low inclinations with respect to the axis of the torus . in this case",
    "the line of sight does not intercept the material in the torus and we have an unobscured view of the central engine . on the other hand ,",
    "agn are optically classified as type 2 if they are observed at high inclinations where the material in the torus does intercept the line of sight obscuring the central engine ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    in recent years",
    "it has been realized that the agn luminosity had to be incorporated as a key ingredient of unified models to explain the observed decrease in the relative fraction of type 2 objects at high agn luminosities .",
    "such a trend , mainly detected in x - ray surveys , has been further confirmed by surveys at optical and infrared wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to explain the scarcity of luminous type 2 agn",
    "the receding torus model has been often invoked .",
    "this model postulates that the luminosity - dependence of the type 2 agn fraction is directly associated with the geometry of the torus in the sense that the covering factor of the torus ( the fraction of the sky as seen by the source obscured by dust ) decreases with increasing agn luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is yet not fully understood how the agn accretion power can influence the physical extent of the torus as there is substantial quantitative disagreement between published luminosity trends ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nuclear spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and mid - infrared interferometric observations of nearby agn are modelled better with clumpy dusty tori , i.e. the obscuring material is not uniformly distributed inside the torus .",
    "in fact the material appears to be distributed in discrete , optically thick clumps ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray spectral variability studies have also confirmed that the gas responsible for most of the x - ray absorption must be clumpy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the clumpy nature of the dusty torus has very important implications for unification models as the classification of an agn turns out to be an orientation - dependent probability .",
    "this means that even if we observe from an agn s equator there is some probability of classifying it as type 1 , while a pole - on agn could still be classified as type 2 if a single cloud intercepts the line of sight .",
    "thus , while in the simplest orientation - based models with a smooth torus type 1 and type 2 agn should have on average tori sharing the same properties , in the framework of ` clumpy unification ' type 2 agn should have tori with geometrical covering factors higher , on average , than type 1 agn ( for a recent review on this topic see @xcite ) .",
    "recent analyses of the nuclear infrared emission of agn with radiative transfer models of clumpy tori indicate that this might be indeed the case ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately until very recently such studies have been restricted to small samples of mostly nearby seyfert galaxies and quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the advent of the all - sky infrared survey conducted with the wide field infrared survey explorer at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22@xmath5 m ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) it is now possible to constrain the properties of the agn tori , in particular its geometrical covering factor , in large , representative samples of objects spanning a broad range of both redshifts and agn luminosities .",
    "the aim of this study is to verify observationally the validity of unified schemes in the framework of clumpy torus models .",
    "to do so we have determined , for the first time , the distribution of covering factors of agn tori using a large , uniformly selected , complete sample of agn .",
    "we have investigated whether type 1 and type 2 agn are indeed intrinsically different objects , as recently claimed in the literature , by comparing the distributions of covering factors of their tori .",
    "finally we have determined the dependence ( or lack of ) of the torus covering factor on the line of sight absorption measured in x - rays and the agn luminosity .",
    "the 227 agn used in this study are drawn from the bright ultra - hard _ xmm - newton _ survey ( buxs ; @xcite ; hereafter m15 ) .",
    "the objects have @xmath1 in the range 0.05 - 1.7 , intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosities between 10@xmath8 and 10@xmath3 @xmath4 and x - ray absorption in the compton - thin regime .",
    "there are a number of reasons why we have chosen the buxs survey to conduct this study .",
    "firstly , its large sample size and high spectroscopic identification completeness : buxs is one of the largest ( 255 objects ) complete flux - limited samples of bright agn selected at energies above 4.5 kev with the _ xmm - newton _ observatory . at the time of writing optical spectroscopic classifications and accurate redshifts are available for 98.4 per cent of the objects . secondly ,",
    "the rich set of multiwavelength data available for all sources : good quality _ xmm - newton _ spectroscopy is available for the full sample , enabling accurate measurements of both the x - ray absorption and intrinsic x - ray luminosities for all objects .",
    "furthermore , 227 out of 233 agn with x - ray luminosities and redshifts in the chosen intervals have rest - frame 1 - 20@xmath5 m nuclear photometric seds associated with the emission from the agn dusty torus from m15 .",
    "clearly , all these properties make our agn sample ideally suited to draw robust statistical constraints on the properties of the dusty torus of agn .    from all the radiative transfer codes",
    "available in the literature to model the infrared emission associated with clumpy tori ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite henceforth referred to collectively as n08 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) we have chosen the n08 models , referred to as clumpy models , as they provide a good representation of the torus sed , and facilitate direct comparison with previous results in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the agn sample used in this study . in sections 3.1 and 3.2 we present the sed fitting techniques used to first isolate the emission associated with the torus and then to model it with the n08 models . in section 3.3",
    "we discuss our approach to determine the distributions of covering factors of agn tori . in section 4 our results",
    "are presented and discussed while in section 5 we summarize our main results . throughout this paper ,",
    "errors are 68 per cent confidence for a single parameter , and we assume @xmath9=0.3 , @xmath10@xmath11=0.7 and @xmath12=70 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 .",
    "the agn in this study are drawn from the wide - angle bright ultra - hard _ xmm - newton _ survey ( buxs ) .",
    "buxs is a complete flux - limited sample of 255 x - ray bright agn ( @xmath14 ) detected at 4.5 to 10 kev energies with the _ xmm - newton _",
    "european photon imaging camera ( epic)-pn ( @xcite ) . the objects were selected at such high energies to reduce as much as possible biases against highly absorbed agn .",
    "the survey covers 44.43 deg@xmath15 of the northern sky ( galactic latitudes @xmath16@xmath1720 @xmath18 ) distributed over 381 _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations having good quality for serendipitous source detection ( @xcite ) . for full details on the survey design , sample selection and",
    "uv / optical spectroscopic identification and classification of the objects see @xcite . at",
    "the time of writing the identification completeness is 98.4percent ( 251 objects ) .",
    "such a high identification rate guarantees that our study will not suffer from biases associated with optical identification incompleteness , that are more severe for highly obscured type 2 agn .",
    "we have good - quality _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectra for all buxs sources , which constrain directly both the line of sight rest - frame absorbing column densities and x - ray luminosities ( see m15 ) . throughout",
    "this paper @xmath19 represents intrinsic , absorption corrected luminosities in the rest - frame 2 - 10 kev band .    for the analysis presented here we selected the 233 non - blazar agn with @xmath19@xmath17@xmath20 and @xmath1@xmath211.7 .",
    "the luminosity cut was applied to reduce to a minimum the uncertainties associated with the determination of the infrared emission of the tori of our objects by increasing the contrast of the agn over the underlying emission from the agn hosts ( 12 objects removed ; see sec .",
    "[ nir ] ) .",
    "the redshift cut was imposed to assure adequate wavelength sampling of the torus rest - frame continuum emission ( six objects removed ) .",
    "finally , we excluded five type 1 agn and one type 2 agn without detections with signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr)@xmath172 at all 3.4 , 4.6 and 12@xmath5 m in the final data release of @xmath7 ( allwise ; @xcite ) .",
    "as the number of objects not detected with @xmath7 above our selection threshold is rather small and , in addition , these objects span a broad range of @xmath19 and @xmath1 , removing them from the sample should not bias our results .",
    "all the above selection criteria left us with a sample of 227 agn with @xmath19 from @xmath20 to @xmath22 and 0.05@xmath21z@xmath211.7 .",
    "we classified our agn as type 1 if permitted and semi - forbidden broad emission lines ( line velocity widths @xmath231500kms@xmath13 ) were detected in their rest - frame uv / optical spectra ( 132 objects ) and as type 2 if they showed narrow emission lines only ( line velocity widths @xmath211500kms@xmath13 ; 75 objects ) or had a galaxy - like spectrum with no emission lines ( 3 objects ) . due to the controversy regarding the nature of intermediate seyfert types 1.8 and 1.9",
    "as type 1 or type 2 agn we kept such objects as a separate class ( 17 objects)@xmath60.2 - 0.4 , depending on whether the h@xmath24 emission line is outside the observable wavelength range of our spectroscopic data or not . ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to investigate whether we find any evidence supporting a scenario where the agn radiation field can affect the torus properties , we have determined the distributions of @xmath0 in two luminosity bins .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "we clearly see that low covering factors are preferred in type 1s at high agn luminosities .",
    "although a similar trend is detected in type 2 objects , it is much less significant .",
    "this is somewhat expected as a decrease in the torus covering factor reduces the probability of identifying an agn as optical type 2 .",
    "we have compared the distributions of @xmath0 obtained at low and high agn luminosities for the same class of objects using the ks test .",
    "we can reject the null hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population only for type 1 agn with a significance of 99.91 per cent .",
    "our sample of type 1 agn reaches @xmath1@xmath61.7 while all type 2 agn have @xmath1@xmath251 . to avoid comparing objects at different evolutionary stages ,",
    "we have also determined the distributions of @xmath0 in our two luminosity bins using type 1 and type 2 objects at @xmath1@xmath211 .",
    "our results do not change .",
    "we note that we reach the same conclusion adopting even lower redshift limits .",
    "this shows that , although the rest - frame infrared spectral regions sampled with our photometric data vary with the objects redshift , this has no effect on the @xmath0 distributions presented in fig .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that our results are robust and they are consistent with a decrease of the covering factor of agn tori with increasing agn luminosity , although for x - ray selected type 2 agn , the effect is modest . a detailed investigation of whether the detected changes of @xmath0 with luminosity are strong enough to explain the observed scarcity of type 2 agn at high luminosities will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the properties of the nuclear infrared continuum emission of agn , in particular the broad - band continuum shape , might depend directly on the covering factor of the torus . to investigate this issue",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( top plots ) a compilation of all nuclear infrared seds of our agn .",
    "as we are only interested in examining the continuum shape , we have normalized all seds at rest - frame 6@xmath5 m to facilitate the comparison .",
    "to do so we have used linear interpolation in log - log space .",
    "we stress that we are only interested in the emission associated with the dusty torus , hence as indicated before , our nuclear infrared seds have been corrected for any contamination from the extrapolated accretion disk emission and , of course , the host galaxy .    the first result from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is that there is a large range of torus - only infrared continuum shapes for both type 1 and type 2 agn .",
    "clearly , at rest - frame wavelengths shorter than @xmath620@xmath5 m there is no canonical infrared slope for either agn class ( for similar results see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , we find that type 1 and type 2 agn show a similar range of infrared continuum slopes although on average type 2 agn have steeper seds .    to investigate the role of the torus covering factor we have compared the seds of objects with tori with low ( @xmath0@xmath210.5 ) and high ( @xmath0@xmath170.5 ) covering factors , respectively .",
    "to assign the objects to the @xmath0@xmath210.5 or @xmath0@xmath170.5 class we have used the median values of the posterior distributions of @xmath0 obtained with the bayesclumpy sed fits for each source .",
    "we then moved all individual seds to rest - frame wavelengths and distributed the photometric data points into a common wavelength grid .",
    "the bins were defined to have at least 13 points and a minimum size of 0.01@xmath5 m .",
    "we have used the astronomy survival analysis package ( asurv ; @xcite ) to determine the median flux values in each bin taking into account both detections and upper - limits . to determine the errors of the median seds fully taking into account both the dispersion and errors in the individual fluxes we used monte carlo simulations . for each photometric point , if it was an upper - limit , we kept the values unchanged while for detections we generated random numbers using gaussian distributions of mean and sigma , the flux measurements and their corresponding uncertainties , respectively . in cases where the simulated flux values were lower than zero , we replaced them with the corresponding flux uncertainties and treated then as upper - limits .",
    "we repeated the monte carlo exercise 10@xmath26 times calculating each time median fluxes in the bins using the asurv package , as we did for the real data .",

    "the reported significant differences in the torus emission , even among agn of the same optical class , imply that infrared flux - limited population studies at rest - frame wavelengths shorter than @xmath65 - 6@xmath5 m , are not free of biases against the most highly absorbed agn , which we have shown are the objects with tori with the highest covering factors .",
    "we can conclude that , the viewing angle , agn luminosity and also @xmath0 determine the optical appearance of an agn .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 controls the overall shape of the nuclear infrared continuum emission at rest - frame @xmath61 - 20@xmath5 m .",
    "thus , the geometrical covering factor of the dusty torus must be incorporated as a key ingredient of unification schemes .",
