    "elastic and inelastic @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2interactions play an important role in understanding of structure of hadrons .",
    "variety of scattering processes , differentiation them into hard and soft ones , single and double diffraction and central hadron production tell us that this structure is rather complicated .",
    "what is the source of complexity ?",
    "if hard processes are the area of application of current quark consideration then soft ones are described in constituent quark approach .",
    "interplay between hard and soft interactions in high energy experiments strictly relates to interconnection between small and large size quark configurations inside a hadron .",
    "we think that this interplay is a manifestation of fluctuations of hadronic matter distributions inside hadrons and these fluctuations in turn are results of correlated motion of valence quarks inside hadrons .",
    "the question arises : is it possible to construct the dynamical system of quarks which can be observed at one instant of time as constituent ( dressed ) quarks and at the another one - as current ( bare ) quarks ? proposed by author the semiclassical model of strongly correlated quarks , scqm , demonstrated how these configurations could be realized inside hadrons@xcite . in this paper",
    "we give further elaboration of the model whichpossesses the features of both constituent and current quark models and allows one to extract confining potential and force(section 2 ) . in section 3",
    "we apply this model for description of diffractive processes and show that explicit manifestation of quark correlation inside hadrons is a single diffractive scattering .",
    "let us imagine the following hypothetical picture : single , colored quark imbedded into vacuum .",
    "because of vacuum fluctuations one can observe two competing processes : first , polarization of @xmath3 sea by the color field of valence quark ( vq ) and second , the tend of vacuum fluctuations to destroy this polarization . as a result",
    ", one can say about a vacuum pressure on a single , colored quark .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as the  response  of the vacuum on the presence of , say , point defect or dislocation like in solid state physics .",
    "what happens if we place in vicinity of this quark the corresponding antiquark ? by virtue of opposite color signs",
    "their polarization fields interfere in the overlapping region *",
    "destructively*. so the pressure of vacuum on quark ( antiquark ) from outside exceeds that one going from inner space between quark and antiquark .",
    "this results in an * attractive * force between quark ( dislocation ) and antiquark ( antidislocation ) .",
    "the density of the remaining part of polarization field around quark ( antiquark ) is identified with hadronic matter distribution . at maximum displacement in @xmath4 system , that corresponds to small overlapping of polarization fields ,",
    "hadronic matter distributions have maximum values .",
    "so quark and antiquark located nearby start moving towards each other .",
    "the closer they to one another , the larger destructive interference effect and the smaller hadronic matter distributions are around vqs and the larger their kinetic energies .    for such interacting @xmath4 system",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath5 were @xmath6 , @xmath7 masses of valence antiquark and quark , @xmath8 their velocity depending on displacement @xmath9 and @xmath10 quark  antiquark potential energy with separation @xmath11 it can be rewritten as @xmath12   + \\left [ \\frac{m_{q}}{(1-\\beta^{2})^{1/2}}+u(x)\\right ]   = h_{\\overline{q}}+h_{q},\\ ] ] were @xmath13 is potenial energy of quark or antiquark .",
    "therefore , keeping in mind that quark and antiquark are strongly correlated we consider each of them separately as undergoing oscillatory motion in 1 + 1 dimension .",
    "generalization to three ",
    "quark system in baryons is performed according to @xmath14 symmetry : an antiquark is replaced by two correspondingly colored quarks to get color singlet baryon and destructive interference takes place between color fields of three valence quarks .",
    "putting aside the mass and charge differences of valence quarks we may say that inside baryon three quarks oscillate along the bisectors of equilateral triangle .",
    "hereinafter we consider that axis @xmath15 is perpendicular to the plane of oscillation @xmath16 .",
    "vq with its polarized surroundings ( hadronic matter distribution ) form constituent quark .",
    "according to our approach potential energy of valence quark , @xmath17 corresponds to the mass @xmath18 of constituent quark : @xmath19 with @xmath20 the knowledge of the mechanism and structure of vacuum polarization around valence quark would give the information about the confining potential .",
    "we can not say at the moment for sure what is the microscopical mechanism of interaction of valence quark with vacuum .",
    "it could be instanton induced interactions , excitation of fractal structure of space  time , etc .",
    "so we assume , as a first approximation , that the polarization field can be taken in gaussian form:@xmath21 where exponent is written in quadratic form .",
    "the same is@xmath22for @xmath23 we define the mass of constituent quark at maximum displacement @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are masses delta  isobar and nucleon correspondingly .",
    "therefore , the parameters of the model are the masses of vqs,@xmath27 which are chosen to be @xmath28 @xmath29 , maximum displacement , @xmath30 and parameters of gaussian function , @xmath31 as shown below , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are adjusted by comparison of calculated and experimental values of inelastic cross sections , @xmath34 for @xmath0 and @xmath35 collisions .        using ( 3)(5 )",
    "we can calculate the confining potential @xmath36 and force @xmath37 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "as one can see the confining potential is essentially nonlinear .",
    "the behavior of potential evidently demonstrates the relationship between constituent and current quark states inside a hadron . at maximum displacement quark",
    "is nonrelativistic , constituent one ( vq surrounded by  polarized sea  ) , since according to ( 3 ) the confining potential corresponds to the mass of constituent quark . at the origin of oscillation ,",
    "@xmath38 antiquark  quark in mesons and 3 quarks in baryons , being close to each other , have maximum kinetic energy and correspondingly minimum potential energy and mass : they are relativistic , current quarks ( bare vqs ) .",
    "intermediate region corresponds to increasing ( decreasing ) of quark s mass by dressing ( undressing ) of quarks due to vacuum polarization .",
    "this mechanism agrees with local gauge invariance principle .",
    "indeed , phase rotation of wave function of single quark in color space @xmath39 on angle @xmath40 depending on displacement @xmath9 of the quark in coordinate space @xmath41 results in it s dressing ( undressing ) by quark and gluon condensate that corresponds to the transformation of gauge field @xmath42 @xmath43 here we dropped color indices and took into account only scalar component , @xmath44 , of gauge field .",
    "thus gauge transformation maps internal ( isotopic ) space of colored quark onto coordinate space . on",
    "the other hand this dynamical picture of vq dressing ( undressing ) corresponds to chiral symmetry breaking ( restoration ) .",
    "the behaviour of field @xmath44 and hadronic matter distribution,@xmath45 , for quark  antiquark system during their oscillations is shown in fig .",

    "when vqs are close each other it is very weak and fulfills the  asymptotic freedom ",
    "behavior of quarks of qcd . at larger distances between vqs",
    "it starts growing rapidly , then reaching maximum value goes down , asymptotically approaching zero .",
    "thus at large distances inside hadrons quarks being in a constituent state are almost free .",
    "hence , it is clear why additive quark model , where quarks are treated as massive , almost unbound and extended objects , works well .",
    "we must emphasize that interaction between vqs is not direct but a result of polarization of surrounding vacuum combined with destructive interference .",
    "attractive force between vqs in ground state hadrons does not appear as gluon string but goes from vacuum suppression that predominates from outside .",
    "therefore , our approach reflects the features of bag models , as well .",
    "the model is in agreement with the experiments ( fig .",

    ". it will be the subject of forthcoming papers .",
    "nevertheless , classical consideration of vq oscillations is justified by e. schrodinger s paper@xcite where he , analyzing the motion of wave packet solution of time dependent schrodinger equation for harmonic oscillator , demonstrated that this wave packet moves in exactly the same way as corresponding classical oscillator . in our model",
    "vq with its surroundings can be treated as ( nonlinear ) wave packet . in forthcoming paper",
    "we ll show that these wave packets possess soliton  like features .",
    "different configurations of quark contents in colliding hadrons realized at the instant of collision result in different types of reactions .",
    "the probability of finding any quark configuration inside a hadron is defined by the probability of vq s displacement in proper frame of a hadron : @xmath49 with @xmath50 configurations with nonrelativistic constituent quarks ( @xmath51 ) in both colliding hadrons lead to multiparticle production in central and fragmentation regions .",
    "hard scattering with jet production and large angle elastic scattering take place when configurations with current vqs ( @xmath52 ) in both colliding hadrons are realized .",
    "intermediate configurations inside one ( both ) of colliding hadron are responsible for single ( double ) diffraction processes and semihard scattering . using impact parameter representation , namely inelastic overlap function ( iof )",

    "one can see that the model with parameters fixed at one energy ( @xmath58 @xmath85 describes the energetic behavior of @xmath77 the growth of cross sections with energy is due to the continuous tails of polarization fields around vqs not compensated by destructive interference with fields of two other vqs . with rising collision energy",
    "these tails result in the increasing effective size of hadronic matter distribution inside nucleons and correspondingly the increasing radius of interactions .",
    "the model gives for cross sections linear logarithmic energy dependence and the curve deviates from data points at very high energies .",
    "the reason of this is that in our geometrical approach , ( ( 12 )  ( 16 ) ) , we did nt take into account the real part of scattering amplitude . at energies",
    "@xmath86 @xmath59 calculated cross sections were corrected on contributions of regge poles exchange by using donnachie and landshoff parametrization@xcite:@xmath87     processes .",
    "extended sizes of colliding nucleons are drawn on impact parameter plane : big grey circles are constituent quarks of dissociating nucleon , small black circles ",
    "( semi)bare quarks of the another nucleon.,width=384 ]    an oscillatory motion of vqs appearing as interplay between constituent and bare ( current ) quark configurations results in fluctuations of hadronic matter distribution inside colliding nucleons .",
    "the manifestation of these fluctuations is a variety of scattering processes , hard and soft , in particular , the process of single diffraction ( sd ) .",
    "we select sd ",
    "events among inelastic @xmath88 events with the criterion @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ( fig . 6 ) . here @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 are momenta of quarks forming the final state proton .",
    "as one can see , sd  events correspond to constituent quark configuration inside one colliding nucleon and ( semi)bare quark configuration inside another one .",
    "7 shows that calculated sd cross section slightly depends on energy ; our calculation for lhc energy gives @xmath94",

    "proposed dynamical model of hadron structure , scqm , possesses some important features .",
    "parameters of the model , maximal displacement of vq , @xmath96 , and extension of quark and gluon condensate around vqs , @xmath97 and @xmath98 characterize extended sizes of hadron .",
    "owing to noncompensated tails of vacuum condensates at outer sides of vqs and condition ( 18 ) , the model describes the energy dependence of inelastic and total cross sections as a result of increasing effective sizes of colliding hadrons . on the other hand",
    ", there is no overlap of hadronic matter distributions in space between vqs of each interacting hadron even at very high energy collisions because destructive interference of their polarization fields reduces resulting hadronic matter at the center of quark system to zero value .",
    "so , the model keeps unitarity and does not need of inclusion of such a questionable effect as  antishadowing ",
    "according to our model diffraction dissociation is not shadowing effect of nondiffractive inelastic process  both compose inelastic process , they merely differ by configurations of quarks inside interacting hadrons .",
    "because of plane oscillations of vqs and flattened ( perpendicular to the plane of oscillation ) form of hadronic matter distributions nucleons are deformed , non - spherical objects . in paper @xcite , assuming that spin of vqs are perpendicular to the plane of oscillations , we showed that such a deformation of proton could manifest itself in total cross section differences between longitudinal and transversal polarization states in proton  proton collisions .",
    "apparently experimental evidence of such a deformation are quadrupole transition amplitudes in @xmath99 electroproduction which are sensitive to quadrupole deformation of the nucleon@xcite .",
    "furthermore hadronic matter distribution inside hadrons and in turn the sizes of hadrons are fluctuating quantities",
    ". fluctuations of extended sizes of nucleons allows one to understand why black disk ",
    "limit is not saturated in @xmath0 and @xmath35 collisions up to very high energies .",
    "we must mention the paper@xcite of s. barshay with co - authors where they incorporated fluctuations in the eikonal into geometric picture for explaining of diffractive processes .",
    "there is a connection between eikonal and inelastic overlap function used in our calculations of cross sections through the expression @xmath100 were @xmath101 is eikonal .",
    "it is obvious that fluctuations of hadronic matter distributions caused by interplay between constituent and current quark configurations inside colliding hadrons lead to fluctuation of eikonal . in their approach",
    "the fluctuations of eikonal were controlled by phenomenological parameter , depending on energy .",
    "they predicted that single diffraction cross section increases reaching 1415 mb at cms energies 20@xmath10240 tev then starts to decrease .",
    "contrary to this prediction there is no apparent reason for any maximum , according to our approach , and this cross section increases steadily , very slightly up to asymptotic energies .",
    "our unified geometrical explanation of diffractive and nondiffractive processes could give an answer on long standing question : what is pomeron ?",
    "historically the concept of `` pomeron '' , starting from simple regge pole with intercept @xmath103 , transformed to a rather complicated object with relatively arbitrary features and smooth meaning . to produce rising cross sections",
    "it must have intercept such that @xmath104 .",
    "the fact that the parameter @xmath105 is universal , independent of particles being scattered in hadronic and dis interactions , could say us that the nature of the cross section growth is the same for all processes .",
    "our interpretation of pomeron is geometrical one .",
    "both diffractive and nondiffractive particle production emerge from disturbance ( excitation ) of overlapped continuous vacuum polarization fields ( gluon and @xmath3 condensate ) around valence quarks of colliding hadrons followed by fragmentation process .",
    "the type of interaction depends on quark configurations inside both colliding hadrons occurring at the instant of interaction and the value of impact parameter .",
