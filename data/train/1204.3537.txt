    "massive binaries made of o - type and/or wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are known to be the scene of stellar wind collisions whose strength is intimately dependent on wind properties . beside the hydrodynamic aspect of such a phenomenon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , colliding - winds offer the opportunity to study higher level physical processes such as copious thermal x - ray emission @xcite or even particle acceleration mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the latter process considers a particle ( electrons and hadrons ) acceleration mechanism taking place in the presence of the strong shocks of the colliding - winds .",
    "historically , the existence of a population of relativistic electrons has been revealed by the detection of non - thermal ( synchrotron ) radio emission coming from several massive stars .",
    "more recently a significant non - thermal high energy counterpart has been confirmed in the case of wr140 in hard x - rays @xcite , and even in @xmath1-rays for @xmath2car @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the luminosity ratio derived at every epoch can be discussed in order to derive additional constraints on the spectral classification of the stars in hd167971 . even though it is quite well - established that the third star should be an o8 supergiant , the spectral types of the components in the close binary are not fully determined .",
    "on the basis of the fundamental parameter values given by @xcite , we derived rough estimates of the expected luminosity ratios assuming various spectral type combinations , and assuming the two components in the close binary to have the same spectral classification . according to the study of @xcite",
    ", the members of the close binary should be main - sequence stars , with spectral types ranging between o5 and o8 .",
    "the expected bolometric luminosities and luminosity ratios , assuming an o8i third star ( with l@xmath3=4@xmath410@xmath5l@xmath6 , @xcite ) , are quoted in table[param ] .",
    "the values given in table[results ] for the measured luminosity ratio seem to significantly change from one epoch to the other .",
    "it should be emphasized that the eclipsing nature of the close binary ( component b ) may be responsible for a significant change of its brightness as a function of time , mostly considering the depth and duration of the eclipses reported for instance by @xcite .",
    "however , the propagation of the uncertainties on the ephemeris of the eclipsing binary over more than 2000 cycles ( between the photometric and interferometric observations ) prevent us from determining the orbital phase of the close binary at the epoch of our interferometric observations . in addition",
    ", a slight difference may also appear between the three amber observations and the pionier measurement , as these instruments operate in different wavebands ( hk and h , respectively ) .",
    "assuming that luminosity ratios should be similar for both bolometric and k - band luminosities , our l@xmath7/l@xmath8 measurements suggests spectral types for the stars in the close binary between o6 and o7 ( typically , o6.5 with an uncertainty of half a spectral type ) for main - sequence stars , as illustrated in fig.[lratiofig ] for the luminosity ratios , but we selected a comfortable confidence range in order to be sure to include the a priori unknown uncertainty on the theoretical luminosity ratio values , and therefore get rid of any overinterpretation of the results . ] . for a giant luminosity class",
    ", the close binary components should not be earlier than o8 , assuming that the third star is at least as luminous as the close binary .",
    "on the basis of these estimates we favor the main - sequence luminosity classes as suggested by @xcite , and we consider that the giant or even supergiant luminosity classes as claimed by @xcite are unlikely .",
    "this result is also in agreement with the idea that the typical radius of evolved stars may be too large to fit within the small orbit of the eclipsing binary .",
    "considering typical radii and masses for o6.5 stars given by @xcite , and applying kepler s law for a 3.3d circular orbit , we estimate that supergiants would be too large and that about 80@xmath9 of the stellar separation would be occupied by the stars if they were giants .",
    "if main - sequence stars are assumed , we estimate that only about 50@xmath9 of the stellar separation is filled by the stars .    assuming an ( o6.5v + o6.5v ) + o8i spectral classification for the stars in hd167971 , we estimate the total visual absolute magnitude m@xmath10=6.73 ( for typical visual magnitudes as given by @xcite ) . for a v apparent magnitude of about 7.35",
    "as reported by @xcite between the eclipses , and a color excess e(b  v ) of 0.9 , we derive a distance modulus of 11.29 , translating into a distance of about 1.8kpc . considering the uncertainties ,",
    "such a distance is in agreement with the distance of 1.7kpc reported by @xcite for the ngc6604 open cluster , lending further support to the adopted spectral classification .",
    "we note that the additional information given here on the spectral classification of the components in hd167971 , with respect to previously published results , should be considered with caution : stellar classification based on luminosities are indeed generally less accurate than classification approaches based on spectroscopic criteria .",
    "this issue would therefore strongly benefit from a long - term spectroscopic monitoring with application of state - of - the - art disentangling techniques to accurately classify individual components in the system , such as in the case of the hierarchical triple system hd150136 @xcite , provided the inclination of the wide orbit allows the measurement of significant radial velocity shifts of spectral lines of the three components .    , width=302 ]      the radio light curve presented by @xcite shows a bright non - thermal radio emission whose strong variability is worth discussing in relation with the long period eccentric orbit .",
    "the demonstration of a gravitational connection between the o8 supergiant and the eclipsing binary provides a straightforwad interpretation scheme for the radio variability : the non - thermal radio photons should arise from an emission region coincident with the wind - wind interaction region in the wide binary , where relativistic electrons ( and particles in general ) are expected to be accelerated . the light curve presented by @xcite at 6",
    "cm is the one that benefits from the best time coverage .",
    "its maximum occurred close to 1988 - 1989 , and its minimum between 1995 and 1999 .",
    "assuming a period of about 20 years , the next maximum is expected to have occurred in 2008 - 2009 , i.e. , close to the time of our observations 1 and 2 . in this context , it is tentative to attribute the maximum radio flux density to orbital phases close to periastron passage , i.e. , when the separation is shorter .    the non - thermal radio emission is indeed expected to be variable mainly for two reasons , respectively related to emission and absorption .",
    "first , the intrinsic synchrotron mechanism responsible for the non - thermal radio emission is more efficient when the stellar separation is shorter ( typically , close to periastron passage ) .",
    "synchrotron emission is indeed dependent on the local magnetic field strength ( @xmath11 ) , where relativistic electrons are accelerated : @xmath12 . considering the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance to the stars described for instance by @xcite , @xmath11",
    "is expected to decrease significantly as the stellar separation increases , leading to a maximum synchrotron emission at periastron .",
    "in addition , one should keep in mind that the kinetic power injected in the wind - wind interaction region , and consequently the power available for particle acceleration , is expected to decrease as the separation increases ( see discussion in sect.[energy ] ) .",
    "second , radio emission from the colliding - winds region is also expected to vary significantly because of the phase - dependent free - free absorption due to the stellar winds material along the line of sight . in very eccentric orbits ,",
    "the absorption is expected to be stronger close to periastron , when the synchrotron emission region is more likely to be located within the @xmath13 radiosphere .",
    "the combination of these two effect is especially striking in the case of the long period wolf - rayet + o - type binary wr140 @xcite , where the radio maximum occurs slightly before periastron , just before the strong increase of the free - free absorption . in the case of hd167971",
    ", however , the impact of free - free absorption is a priori expected to be less spectacular : ( i ) the winds of the o - type stars in our target are not so efficient at absorbing radio photons as the wr wind in wr140 ; ( ii ) hd167971 is not so asymmetric as wr140 and the stagnation point in the wide orbit is more likely to be located close to mid - separation . as a result",
    ", we consider that the variability of the radio light curve in hd167971 should be dominated by the variation in the synchrotron emission , with a maximum rather close to periastron passage .",
    "finally , considering the rather wide orbit of the system whose wind - wind interaction is responsible for the non - thermal radio emission , along with the large brightness of the synchrotron source in the system , we claim that hd167971 would deserve high angular resolution radio imaging observations using very long baseline interferometer facilitites such as the vlba , as already done in the case of a few systems such as wr140 @xcite , wr146 @xcite , wr147 @xcite , hd93129a @xcite and cygob2#5 @xcite .",
    "this would allow to spatially disentangle the thermal and non - thermal contributions in hd167971 , and therefore more accurately quantify the synchrotron luminosity without contamination by the free - free ( thermal ) emission arising in individual stellar winds .",
    "the results detailed in previous sections allow us to give a few words on energetic considerations related to the physics of massive binaries , and in particular to particle acceleration and non - thermal processes in general .",
    "the available energy for physical processes related to the wind - wind interaction comes from the kinetic power of the colliding stellar winds . for a stellar wind with mass loss rate @xmath14 and terminal velocity @xmath15 ,",
    "the kinetic power is @xmath16 . for a long period orbit as the one revealed by our interferometric measurements ,",
    "the stellar winds are expected to have reached their terminal velocity before colliding .",
    "considering the spectral types and luminosity classes discussed in sect.[comp ] , and assuming terminal velocities of 3000kms@xmath17 , we used the predicted mass loss rates given by @xcite based on stellar parameters from @xcite to compute kinetic powers of about 1.9@xmath410@xmath18 and 0.7@xmath410@xmath18ergs@xmath17 respectively for components a and b. in order to evaluate the energy injected in the colliding - wind region , one has to consider the fractional solid angle of the wind - wind interaction region as seen from each star surface .",
    "typically , one could consider that it amounts up to a few per cent .",
    "if a fraction of about 5@xmath9 is assumed , the total energy per unit time injected in the wind - wind interaction by both stars is about 10@xmath19ergs@xmath17 .",
    "the efficiency of the conversion of collision mechanical energy to particle acceleration is expected to be of the order of one per cent , shared between electrons and hadrons ( mostly protons ) , i.e. , about 10@xmath20ergs@xmath17 .",
    "the assumed value for the electron - to - hadron acceleration efficiency is still uncertain for colliding - wind binaries .",
    "considering that this quantity is similar for environments accelerating cosmic - rays in general , it should be of the order of 1@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , we should not reject the possibility that this efficiency ratio may be somewhat different , and possibly larger ( 110@xmath9 ) . consequently ,",
    "at the level of approximation of this discussion , we will consider that 10@xmath2110@xmath22ergs@xmath17 is potentially available for non - thermal emission processes involving relativistic electrons ( i.e. , so - called leptonic processes ) .    in massive star environments ,",
    "the most efficient non - thermal leptonic process is expected to be inverse compton ( ic ) scattering ( i.e. , energy transfer from relativistic electrons to uv and visible photons that are up - scattered in the high energy domain ) .",
    "considering the ratio between magnetic and radiation energy densities close to massive stars , ic scattering will be the dominant energy loss process for relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "typically , one could expect that at most one per cent of the energy transferred to relativistic electrons is converted into synchrotron radiation in the radio domain . as a result ,",
    "the synchrotron radio luminosity should be of the order of 10@xmath2310@xmath24ergs@xmath17 .",
    "this number is worth comparing to observational quantities as reported in the study by @xcite .",
    "to do so , we need radio flux density measurements at the same epoch in order to derive a spectral index .",
    "we selected in the data published by blomme et al .",
    "measurements obtained in february 1985 , with measurements respectively of 7.4@xmath250.4mjy at 2 cm and 14.7@xmath250.3mjy at 6 cm . from these quantities , we determine a spectral index @xmath26 , which is a comfortable non - thermal value .",
    "we can therefore consider that the radio emission at the selected date is clearly dominated by synchrotron radiation , and that thermal contributions from the individual stellar winds contribute only a small fraction of the measured flux density at a given wavelength .",
    "using equation ( 26 ) in @xcite and assuming a distance of 1.7kpc for the ngc6604 open cluster harboring hd167971 @xcite , we converted the flux density into an integrated radio luminosity of about 10@xmath24ergs@xmath17 .",
    "the latter value is close to the maximum expected on the basis of the above discussion .",
    "this suggests that the electron - to - hadron particle acceleration efficiency is rather high in hd167971 , or that the energy injection in the particle acceleration mechanism is especially efficient .",
    "these considerations lend further support to the idea that hd167971 is an especially valuable target for the investigations of non - thermal processes in o - type multiple systems .",
    "these estimates suggest finally that the remaining energy injected in the relativistic electron population ( i.e. , about 10@xmath2110@xmath22ergs@xmath17 ) should be available for ic scattering , likely responsible for a weak hard x - ray emission ( and potentially soft @xmath1-rays ) . considering the sensitivity of current high energy facilities ,",
    "the detection of such an ic scattering emission is unlikely , and next generation hard x - ray facilities such as astro - h ( jaxa mission to be launched in 2014 , @xcite ) are required to detect and quantify this emission process , and therefore derive valuable constraints on the non - thermal and electron - to - hadron efficiency .",
    "our analysis provided for the first time evidence that hd167971 is a gravitationally bound hierarchical triple system , with a very eccentric wide outer orbit . using long baseline interferometry ( with amber and pionier instruments at the vlti )",
    ", we resolved the system into two components : ( i ) the close eclipsing o - type binary and ( ii ) the additional o - type supergiant .",
    "the small fraction of the orbit covered by our observations suggests that the orbit between the two resolved components is wide , in agreement with the previously published lower limit on the orbital period of about 20yr , on the basis of the radio light curve .",
    "our results suggest an eccentricity of at least 0.25 ( and most probably @xmath27 ) , even though additional interferometric observations are required to ascertain its value .",
    "our measurements of the luminosity ratio allowed us to derive some constraints on the spectral classification of the members of the triple system . considering that the brightest component is the o8i star identified by previous studies , our results favor an o6-o7 main - sequence classification for the two stars in the close binary ( assuming these two stars are very similar , in agreement with previously published photometric results ) .",
    "on the basis of these results , we can comfortably argue that the strong non - thermal radio emission associated to hd167971 should come from the wind - wind interaction region between the close binary and the additional supergiant .",
    "the rather wide orbit allows the bulk of the synchrotron radio emission to escape the stellar winds without undergoing strong free - free absorption .",
    "the large ( though undetermined ) eccentricity of the orbit provides a straightforward explanation for the strong variability of the non - thermal radio emission in hd167971 . assuming an orbital period of about 20yr , as suggested by previously published radio light curves , our results provide hints for a maximum radio emission occurring close to periastron passage .",
    "a more complete interferometric monitoring of hd167971 is however needed to establish that coincidence with more accuracy .",
    "we emphasize that our results lend additional support to the so called standard scenario for non - thermal processes in massive star environments , that considers efficient particle acceleration in the colliding - winds region .",
    "finally , we note that the wide orbit and the brightness of the synchrotron source in hd167971 designate it as a potential good target for future high resolution radio imaging observations of colliding - wind massive binaries .",
