    "a cornerstone of the theory of convexity is helly s theorem  @xcite , which states that if there is a point common to every @xmath4 ( or fewer ) members of a collection of compact convex sets in @xmath0 , then the whole family has a point in common .",
    "vincensini  @xcite asked if there was a similar result for line secants to compact convex sets in the plane . in 1940 , santal showed that this was impossible in general , found a sufficient condition for the result to hold for lines in the plane , and generalized that to lines in @xmath0 , giving a helly - type theorem for line transversals to boxes  @xcite .",
    "a _ box _ in @xmath0 is a product of @xmath3 intervals , one in each coordinate direction .",
    "[ t : santalo_lines ] if every @xmath5 ( or fewer ) members of a collection of boxes in @xmath0 admit a line transversal , then there is a line transversal to all the boxes .",
    "this was the first of a great many results in what is now known as geometric transversal theory  @xcite .",
    "santal s elementary proof was based on an idea that radon had used to establish helly s theorem  @xcite .",
    "grnbaum  @xcite showed that these numbers are the best possible ; there are 6 squares in the plane , every five of which have a line transversal , but all six do not .",
    "if we ignore the factor @xmath6 , which is simply the number of direction classes for lines in @xmath0 that are not parallel to any coordinate hyperplane , the number in santal s theorem is the helly number for dimension @xmath7 , which is the dimension of the space of lines in @xmath0 .",
    "this is not a coincidence  for as we shall see , santal s theorem is essentially helly s theorem in disguise .",
    "a line in @xmath0 is _ weakly ascending _ if all non - zero coordinates of its direction vector have the same sign .",
    "if no coordinates of its direction vector vanish , then such a line is _",
    "ascending_. a _ frame - convex _ set of ( ascending ) lines is the set of lines that meet every box in a given collection of boxes .",
    "( since the notion of a ` box ' is dependent on the choice of coordinate frame , this notion of convexity is as well . )",
    "this is related to a general theory of convexity on grassmannians due to goodman and pollack  @xcite in which a set @xmath8 of @xmath9-flats is convex if whenever a @xmath9-flat @xmath10 meets every convex body meeting every member of @xmath8 , then @xmath10 lies in @xmath8 .",
    "for frame convexity , we restrict the convex bodies to be boxes and work with lines rather than @xmath9-flats .",
    "weakly ascending lines admit natural cremona coordinates ( described in section  [ s : santalo ] ) which identify them with a convex set in @xmath1 .",
    "[ t : convexity ] the cremona coordinates of a frame - convex set of weakly ascending lines form a convex set .",
    "this elementary result can be seen in a close reading of santal s arguments .",
    "we give a short proof of theorem  [ t : convexity ] and also of santal s theorem in section  [ s : santalo ] .",
    "the converse of theorem  [ t : convexity ] is not true in general .",
    "a set @xmath11 of weakly ascending lines is _ cremona - convex _ if the set of cremona coordinates of its members form a convex set .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are ascending lines in @xmath0 that meet in a point .",
    "then their cremona - convex hull is 1-dimensional , but their frame - convex hull may have any dimension between 1 and @xmath14 .",
    "the case @xmath15 is described in example  [ ex : lines_meet ] . despite this , these two notions of convexity coincide for ascending skew lines that satisfies the additional condition that the images of the direction vectors by the orthogonal projection to any coordinate plane are distinct ( see corollary  [ cor : general ] ) .    for ascending lines",
    ", the cremona coordinates of theorem  [ t : convexity ] come from a particular cremona transformation on plcker space that transforms the grassmannian of lines into a linear space .",
    "this linearizing cremona transformation is related to kapranov s identification of the chow quotient of the grassmannian of lines as the space @xmath16 of @xmath17 marked points on @xmath18  @xcite , and it underlies some recent work on the tropical grassmannian of lines  @xcite .",
    "we obtain a precise geometric description of the cremona - convex hull and cremona - affine span of a set of lines .",
    "for example , consider two skew ascending lines in @xmath19 such that there is a unique line parallel to each axis meeting the two given lines .",
    "then these three axis - parallel lines lie on a unique doubly ruled quadric , either a hyperboloid of one sheet or a hyperbolic paraboloid .",
    "the three axis - parallel lines lie in one ruling and the two original lines lie in the other .",
    "the two original lines determine two intervals in their ruling ( three in the case of a hyperbolic paraboloid ) .",
    "one of those intervals consists solely of ascending lines , and this interval is the frame - convex interval between the original two lines .",
    "this is shown in the figure on the left in figure  [ f : cremona_interval ] .",
    "@xmath20{figures / interval.eps}\\qquad     \\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figures / triangle.eps}\\ ] ]    the cremona - affine span of three general lines in @xmath19 consists of the secant lines to a particular rational cubic curve .",
    "this is illustrated in the figure on the right in figure  [ f : cremona_interval ] , where we display two branches of the rational cubic and lines that are the extreme points of the cremona - convex hull of three lines . in section",
    "[ s : cremona - affine ] we explain this more generally in @xmath0 .    replacing boxes by parallelepipeds with parallel edges",
    "gives the coordinate - free version of frame convexity .",
    "this was the original context of santal s results .",
    "santal also proved a helly - type theorem for hyperplane transversals , which follows from the observation that for ascending hyperplanes ( suitably defined ) , frame convexity coincides with a natural notion of convexity given by the coefficients of the defining equation .",
    "santal asked if his results could be extended to @xmath9-flats in @xmath0 , for @xmath21 .",
    "we do not know if this is possible , but feel that it is unlikely . in part that is because the linearizing cremona transformation does not generalize to the grassmannian with @xmath22 . also , we show that the frame - convex hull of two general 2-flats in @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( suitably defined ) is just the two original 2-flats , and thus frame convexity in this context has a completely different character than for lines or hyperplanes .",
    "on the other hand , since the set of @xmath25-flats in @xmath2 is isomorphic to the set of lines in @xmath2 , the notion of frame convexity for ascending lines can be transferred to @xmath25-flats and gives it a convexity structure .",
    "we describe this in section  [ s : frame ] , and derive the corresponding theorem of helly type .",
    "we thank bernd sturmfels , who pointed out to us the relation of the cremona transformation to chow quotients and to the tropical grassmannian .",
