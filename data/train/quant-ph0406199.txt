    "<S> nonlocal nature apparently shown in entanglement is one of the most striking features of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the locality assumption in bell - type proofs for entangled qubits , i.e. the outcome of a qubit at one end is independent of the basis choice at the other end . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been claimed that in order to properly incorporate the phenomenon of self - observation , the heisenberg picture with time going backwards provides a consistent description . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , if this claim holds true , the assumption in nonlocality proofs that basis choices at two ends are independent of each other may no longer be true , and may pose a threat to the validity of bell - type proofs .    </S>",
    "<S> nonlocality , basis choices , entanglement    the nonlocal nature exhibited in quantum entanglement is arguably the most distinctive departure from classical physics . after bell </S>",
    "<S> s pioneering work @xcite in testing nonlocality in entangled quantum systems , a number of variations of theoretical models @xcite and experimental confirmations have followed @xcite . while these truly marvelous results appear to have confirmed the validity of quantum theory and triumphed over locality imposed by relativity , subtle related issues remain . </S>",
    "<S> that is , although quantum theory indeed appears to possess nonlocality , this property can not be used for superluminal signalling . </S>",
    "<S> this is rather puzzling because there seems to exist faster - than - light influencing yet superluminal signalling is not allowed . </S>",
    "<S> another puzzling feature related to entanglement is the negativity shown in the conditional entropy of entangled quantum systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while a number of interpretations have been made with regard to this negativity @xcite , this issue is still considered to be unsettled @xcite . due to this negativity </S>",
    "<S> , cerf and adami @xcite have proposed to interpret entanglement as a qubit and anti - qubit correlation where anti - qubit is a qubit traveling backwards in time .    in bell - type inequality proofs such as that of clauser - horne - shimony - holt @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> one of the critical assumptions is the locality condition : that is , the outcome of a particle , say at alice s end , is independent of the basis choice at the other end , or at bob s end . </S>",
    "<S> this then implies that the basis choice at one end can not be correlated with the basis choice at the other end . </S>",
    "<S> this is because if the basis choice were correlated , i.e. , if the basis choice at one end is influenced by the basis choice at the other end , then a qubit at bob s end could learn about alice s basis choice through the measurement basis at bob s end . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to examine this particular assumption made in bell - type proofs , i.e. , we wish to consider if the assumption that basis choices at two ends are uncorrelated is sound and solid . in order to examine this assumption in fuller detail , </S>",
    "<S> let us review the concept of the physical reality defined by einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) @xcite as follows : +   + _ if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.e. , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity_. +   + let us consider epr s definition of physical reality with a single qubit . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote the value of a physical quantity for a given qubit as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement on the single qubit can be done with a certain choice of observable and the outcome would be @xmath1 . if we denote the choice of observable as @xmath2 , then the value of a physical quantity , i.e. , the physical reality for the qubit , can be written as follows , @xmath3 that is , the physical reality of the qubit is obtained as a function of the choice of measurement basis . </S>",
    "<S> we now wish to examine the physical reality of the choice of measurement basis , i.e. , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , there are a number of ambiguous elements if we wish to discuss the physical reality of the basis choices . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is unclear what makes the decision to choose certain basis , i.e. , is it the computer random number generator , a detector , or a human brain . instead of considering the physical reality of basis choice as a function of these ambiguous elements , </S>",
    "<S> we wish to consider the @xmath2 as a function of the value of a physical quantity , i.e. , @xmath0 . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , there is a big assumption since the decision of making an observable choice takes place prior to the eigenvalue outcome , we are considering the physical reality of the past event as a function of the future event .    in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the observables were considered as observer s reference frame in observing and measuring a given quantum state . in particular , it was argued that when it is the unitary transformation of the observer s reference frame that is observed by the same observer , both the schrdinger and the heisenberg pictures can not describe this phenomenon consistently . </S>",
    "<S> it was then argued @xcite that in order to correctly describe the observation of observer s own reference frame is to consider the heisenberg picture with time going backwards , i.e. , it is the observables , or the observer s reference frame , that is evolving backwards in time . with this argument in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a simple example . </S>",
    "<S> suppose for a given qubit @xmath4 , an observer is to measure this qubit either in @xmath5- or @xmath6-basis . </S>",
    "<S> if the observer chooses @xmath5-basis , then he applies an identity operator and measure with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath6-basis is chosen , the observer applies a hadamard gate , @xmath8 , to the given qubit and measures @xmath9 and the eigenvalue outcome @xmath1 would be obtained . in the heisenberg picture , rather than the state being unitarily transformed , it is the basis choice that is evolving . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> suppose at @xmath10 , the observer chooses to measure either in @xmath5- or @xmath6-basis . </S>",
    "<S> then either @xmath11 or @xmath12 is applied to @xmath5 basis and @xmath5 or @xmath13 is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> since we are taking an assumption that the unitary transformation is being done in time backward manner , when the eigenvalue outcome is obtained at @xmath14 , and the eigenvalue of @xmath1 would be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we see that if we take the result in @xcite , the eigenvalue outcome ( at @xmath14 ) takes place prior to the basis choice at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies our method of considering the physical reality of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 if we assume the claim in @xcite is correct .    let us suppose that two spatially distant parties , called alice and bob , share maximally entangled qubits @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as follows : latexmath:[\\[|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}(|0\\rangle_{q_1 } |0\\rangle_{q_2 } -    bob choose to measure either in @xmath5 or @xmath6 basis with @xmath18 , respectively , and the eigenvalue outcomes @xmath1 are obtained at each end . </S>",
    "<S> let us focus our attention to two events taking place at two different times , i.e. , when the basis choice is made which we will set to be at @xmath10 and when the eigenvalue outcome is obtained at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the eigenvalue outcome is a prior event than the basis choice and we wish to examine correlation of basis choices with respect to the eigenvalue outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> deutsch and hayden gave a useful notation in describing the entangled qubits in the heisenberg picture . </S>",
    "<S> however , for our purpose , it would be more convenient to discuss the correlation of basis choices with respect to the eigenvalue outcomes in the schrdinger picture . </S>",
    "<S> although in @xcite , it was shown that the heisenberg picture that gives a correct picture rather than the schrdinger picture , this only applies to a very special case , just as newton s theory is much more convenient and sufficient method in most cases even though relativity is the correct description . </S>",
    "<S> since it would more convenient in analyzing the basis choices with respect to eigenvalue , we wish to write down the process in the schrdinger picture . </S>",
    "<S> the only thing to remember is that we will consider the basis choice with respect to the eigenvalue outcomes .    </S>",
    "<S> we will assume alice and bob each possess extra qubits @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which will be used to represent their choice of measurement basis , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , alice has @xmath15 and @xmath19 , while bob contains @xmath16 and @xmath20 at his end . </S>",
    "<S> now , alice and bob can measure @xmath15 and @xmath16 in either @xmath5 or @xmath6 bases with @xmath18 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if alice chooses to measure @xmath15 in @xmath5 basis , she prepares @xmath19 to be @xmath21 and does not apply any unitary operation on @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> if alice wants to measure in @xmath6 basis , she then prepares @xmath22 and applies the hadamard operation , @xmath12 , to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the outcome of @xmath19 will indicate the chosen basis while the outcome of @xmath15 will be either @xmath23 or @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that we will consider @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent observers choice of observables . following the suggestion in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider @xmath19 and @xmath20 as functions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> alice could choose @xmath5 or @xmath6 by preparing @xmath19 to be in @xmath25 initially , then projecting it onto @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> if the outcome is @xmath23 , then she does nt apply any unitary operation on @xmath15 , while hadamard gate is applied for @xmath24 outcome of @xmath19 . or alice can toss a coin and prepare @xmath21 for heads while preparing @xmath22 and applying hadamard to @xmath15 for tails . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , bob can prepare @xmath27 if he wishes to measure in @xmath5 while preparing @xmath28 , and apply @xmath12 to @xmath16 when it is to be measured in @xmath6 basis . the final state for qubits @xmath29 , and @xmath20 can then be written as follows : @xmath30   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{4 } |0\\rangle_{q_1}\\langle 0| \\otimes   |1\\rangle_{q_2}\\langle 1| \\otimes \\big </S>",

    "<S> , we would like to consider elements of physical reality for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which represent the basis choice , as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> now , let us make an assumption that an element of reality of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) will not be a function of @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) . the probability of obtaining @xmath23 and @xmath23 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 when @xmath32 and @xmath33 is 1/2 . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider these 50% of the runs where @xmath19 and @xmath20 will both be @xmath23 when @xmath32 and @xmath33 . according to ( [ rho ] ) , when @xmath23 and @xmath23 are obtained from @xmath15 and @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> , we can predict with certainty the outcome of @xmath20 will be @xmath24 as long as the outcome of @xmath16 is @xmath24 . therefore , according to the reality criterion given by epr the value for the elements of reality for the outcome of @xmath20 as a function of @xmath16 is the following , @xmath34 in the 50% of the runs we are considering , @xmath35 in ( [ value1 ] ) should not change even if @xmath15 is @xmath24 instead of @xmath23 since we assumed the element of reality for @xmath20 will not be a function of @xmath15 . similarly , in these runs , when the outcomes of @xmath16 and @xmath20 are @xmath23 and @xmath23 , respectively , when @xmath36 , @xmath19 must yield @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can deduce the value of the element of reality for @xmath19 with respect to @xmath15 in these events as @xmath37 since we derived the value for the element of reality for @xmath19 with no dependence on @xmath16 , these values should not change when @xmath38 . along with @xmath35 s independence of @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> this contradicts the fact that , according to ( [ rho ] ) , when @xmath36 and @xmath38 , the probability of getting @xmath24 and @xmath24 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 is zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we are led to an inconsistency when we assumed an element of reality for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) can not be a function of @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) s outcome . if the value for the element of reality for @xmath19 can be derived not only as a function of @xmath15 but also of @xmath16 , and similarly for @xmath20 as a function of both @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the contradiction can be avoided . while using the logic in @xcite , we ve shown that an element of reality for @xmath19 is a function of at least @xmath15 and @xmath16 while @xmath20 s reality is also dependent on the same @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that , with respect to the outcome of entangled quantum systems @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 can not be independent from each other .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that if we take the claim in @xcite , i.e. , the observer s reference frame going backwards in time , the assumption in bell - type proofs , which states that the basis choice at two ends are not correlated at two ends , may not be valid . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , there is always the possibility that two detectors might have interacted a long time ago . </S>",
    "<S> however , what we have shown in regards to the correlation of measurement bases is fundamentally different from such possibility . </S>",
    "<S> we considered that the basis between @xmath6 and @xmath5 may be chosen by collapsing a superposed qubit . </S>",
    "<S> since this qubit is a pure state , there should not be any correlation with any other system , including a detector , at the other end . </S>",
    "<S> even when the basis was chosen randomly based on quantum probability , we have shown that there is still a possibility that two basis choices are correlated . </S>"
