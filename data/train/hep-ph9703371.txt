    "<S> 12.38.lg    the origin of mass differences in isospin multiplets has long been of great interest in nuclear and particle physics as a source of information about symmetry violations . </S>",
    "<S> hadronic isospin violations are particularly important in that they arise from quark mass differences in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( see ref.@xcite for a review of the early work in this area ) , and of course electromagnetic effects . among the first applications of the method of qcd sum rules was the study of isospin violations in the @xmath2 system@xcite , in which it was recognized that the isospin splitting of the light - quark condensates can produce effects as large as the current - quark mass splittings and electromagnetic effects . </S>",
    "<S> recently the qcd sum rule method has been used to study the neutron - proton mass difference@xcite , the octet baryon mass splittings@xcite and the mass differences in the charmed meson systems ( the d and @xmath3 scalar and vector mesons)@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the isospin symmetry breakings of pions have been discussed extensively in the chiral perturbation theory , in which the electromagnetic effects are shown to be dominant in the mass splittings of pions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a consistent treatment of the electromagnetic effect is particularly important for the isospin symmetry breakings in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 , systems . in comparison with hadronic quark models , </S>",
    "<S> the qcd sum rule method for calculating isospin splittings has the advantage that one can directly use qed field theory rather than rely on models to estimate coulomb corrections . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a systematic approach for the electromagnetic effects in the operator product expansion for the @xmath0 systems has been developed , in which the problem of the gauge invariance for the charged @xmath0 states was resolved . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to investigate the violations of the isospin symmetry due to all three effects , the nonperturbative effects , the quark mass differences and the electromagnetic effects , consistently in the qcd sum rule method . </S>",
    "<S> the nonterturbative effect is due to the difference of the quark condensate , which arises from the up and down quark mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our studies@xcite in the heavy - light quark systems are in good agreement with the available data . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this paper is to extend our early studies to the light - light quark systems , such as the @xmath7 and @xmath1 systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic approach of the qcd sum rule is to study the two - point correlation function in the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) , defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 the @xmath10 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ i ] can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the leading term , and @xmath13 represents the contributions from the electromagnetic effects . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath12 has been evaluated in the literature . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite by including the flavor dependences of each term . in order to study the violations of the isospin symmetry , the electromagnetic effects @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> should also be written in the framework of the operator product expansion . </S>",

    "<S> , one could simply obtain the two - point functions by changing the gluons in qcd to the photons in qed in fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the quark charge and @xmath19 is the infrared cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this result is gauge invariant .    following the procedure in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there are additional feynman diagrams shown in fig.2 for the charged current so that the @xmath20 for the charged @xmath0 systems is gauge invariant . thus , the two point function @xmath20 for the charged @xmath0 systems is @xmath21    the leading nonperturbative terms due to the electromagnetic effects are the four quark condensates , of which the feynman diagrams are shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> we present the expressions for @xmath10 @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the @xmath1 systems , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the @xmath7 systems , in which we have assumed the vacuum dominance and factorization hypothesis for the four quark condensates following ref . @xcite . in the appendix we present expressions in which the vacuum dominance approximation has not been implemented . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity to the possible deviation from vacuum dominance approximation will be discussed later .    </S>",
    "<S> the isospin symmetry breakings of these systems are determined by the difference between @xmath26 , and we have @xmath27 for @xmath1 states , and @xmath28 for pions . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ d1 ] and [ d2 ] represents the electromagnetic effects , and the last two terms correspond to the isospin violations in the quark masses and condensates . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the contributions from the electromagnetic effects and the differences of the quark masses and condensates to the isospin symmetry breakings of @xmath7 and @xmath1 states should have the same order of magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , eqs . [ d1 ] and [ d2 ] show explicitly that the contributions from the differences of quark masses and condensates are of higher order relative to the electomagnetic effects . </S>",
    "<S> this has been shown in ref . </S>",

    "<S> we adopt the standard one resonance plus a continuum model for the spectral density im@xmath29 at the hadronic level : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is related to the electronic width of the @xmath1 meson and @xmath32gev@xmath33 is the @xmath1 meson continuum threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath34gev@xmath33 in the pseudo vector channel so that the sum rule is dominated by the pion and the @xmath35 meson contributes only to the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> although it is impossible to extract the pion masses in the qcd sum rule framework , it is still possible to calculate their decay constants with the physical masses as the inputs @xcite . after making the borel transformation and transferring the continuum contribution to the right hand side , </S>",

    "<S> our numerical analysis shows that contributions from the differences of quark masses and condensates are indeed negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we have the resulting @xmath60 mev , and this is not inconsistent with the experimental value from the particle data group , of which @xmath61mev@xcite .    with the physical pion masses </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding threshold parameters are @xmath67gev@xmath33 and @xmath68gev@xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> our result is @xmath69mev , while the data in the particle data group for @xmath70 suggest @xmath71 mev@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our numerical analysis shows that the quantity @xmath72 is dominated by the second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ d2 ] , which comes from the four quark condensates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is very sensitive to the vacuum dominance approximation adopted in our approach . </S>",
    "<S> the possible violation of this approximation was discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we introduce a factor @xmath73 in front of the qed induced four quark condensates based on the factorisation assumption in ( [ r- ] ) , ( [ r0 ] ) , ( [ p- ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) . a nonvanishing @xmath74 signals the breakdown of the factorisation hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath55 is insensitive to @xmath74 since it is dominated by the electromagnetic radiative correction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath72 is increased to @xmath75mev with @xmath76 , which is in good agreement with the pdg data . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> more accurate data on @xmath72 will determine how much the vacuum dominance approximation is being violated .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a field theory calculation of the electromagnetic effects in the isospin symmetry breakings of the @xmath7 and @xmath1 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown explicitly that the isospin symmetry breaking induced by the elctromagnetic effects are dominant in the @xmath7 and @xmath1 systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the electromagnetic effects in isospin symmetry breakings of pions are much larger than that of @xmath1 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the available data , although we have not included the effects due to the @xmath78 mixings in the mass splittings of @xmath1 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , more accurate data are needed to test our theoretical approach , and to determine the possible deviation from the factorization of the qed - induced four quark condensates .    </S>",
