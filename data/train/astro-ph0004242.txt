    "nearby galaxy clusters exhibit a tight correlation between x - ray isophotal size and emission weighted intracluster medium ( icm ) temperature ( @xcite ; hereafter me97 ) .",
    "this correlation is evidence of regularity ; it exists in an x - ray flux limited sample of 45 clusters ( @xcite ) , where no attempt has been made to use the x - ray morphologies to exclude clusters showing signatures of recent , major mergers .",
    "the scatter around the x - ray size  temperature ( st ) relation is approximately 15% in size , comparable to the scatter of elliptical and lenticular galaxies around their fundamental plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "this small scatter in the galaxy cluster scaling relation is intriguing , because ( 1 ) there is overwhelming evidence that galaxy clusters are still accreting mass ( e.g. @xcite ) and ( 2 ) elliptical galaxies are generally thought to be among the most regular objects in the universe .",
    "me97 use 48 n - body and hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation in four different cosmological models to address this apparent contradiction between regularity and ongoing accretion in nearby clusters . using simulations from both @xmath8 and @xmath4 cosmologies ,",
    "they show that a tight st relation is expected even in cosmogonies where there is significant cluster growth at the present epoch .",
    "the high degree of regularity implied by the st relation is surprising , because the well known correlation between x - ray luminosity and emission weighted mean temperature ( the  relation ) has very large scatter ( @xcite ) .",
    "me97 show that the same cluster ensemble which exhibits a  15% scatter in the st relation exhibits a 52% scatter in @xmath9 around the  relation .",
    "this higher scatter in the  relation results from the sensitivity of the x - ray luminosity to the densest regions of the cluster a sensitivity to the presence or absence of so - called cooling flows ( @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation is supported by more recent work where cluster ensembles specially chosen to contain no cooling flow clusters conform to  relations with significantly reduced scatter of  25% ( @xcite ) . additionally , when central parts of cooling flow clusters are excluded , the scatter in the  relation decreases ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , cluster regularity is also evident in the tight correlation between icm mass and emission weighted temperature ( the  relation ) . when measuring icm mass within a limiting radius of  ( the radius where the enclosed overdensity is 500 times the critical density ) the scatter in mass about the  relation is 17% ( @xcite ) .",
    "observational studies of the st relation followed by work on the  and  relations support a scenario where clusters exhibit regularity similar to that of elliptical galaxies in the properties measured on the scales of their virial regions , but exhibit significant irregularities in the properties of the densest , central regions where physical processes other than gravity and gas dynamics such as radiative cooling and magnetic fields play significant roles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the evidence indicating cluster regularity is balanced by evidence for departures from regularity ; the scatter in the observed scaling relations is larger than can be accounted for by the measurement uncertainties .",
    "this resolved scatter contains clues about , among other things , cluster peculiar velocities and departures from equilibrium .",
    "here we examine the st relation at intermediate redshift ( @xmath10 ) using rosat hri observations of the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ; e.g. @xcite ) cluster sample .",
    "the st relation provides a potentially powerful tool to study the expansion history of the universe . as explained in detail below , the st relation is rather insensitive to cosmological evolution .",
    "thus , armed with an accurate model of cluster evolution , one could use the st relation to measure distances at intermediate redshift , constraining the deceleration parameter @xmath11 .",
    "we first present the x - ray st relation in the nearby cluster sample ( @xmath12[sec : localst ] ) and then present an interpretation of the st relation in terms of regularity in the underlying dark matter properties of the cluster .",
    "section [ sec : midzst ] describes observations of the st relation in intermediate redshift clusters . in @xmath12[sec : cosmo ] we use these observations to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] contains a summary of our conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we use @xmath13 .",
    "below we present observations of the st relation in an x - ray flux limited sample of clusters and then discuss cluster scaling relations .",
    "fig [ fig : stnearby ] contains a plot of the x - ray st relation for an ensemble of nearby galaxy clusters ( see me97 for cluster list ) .",
    "this sample is essentially a low redshift sample , @xmath14 with rms variation @xmath15 , but the full redshift range is @xmath16 .",
    "the cluster isophotal size @xmath17 is plotted versus the emission weighted mean icm temperature , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the area enclosed by the isophote @xmath20 . the isophotal size is a model - independent measure extracted directly from the x - ray image .",
    "icm temperatures come from the literature ( listed in me97 ) . in this figure",
    "we use the galactic absorption corrected surface brightness @xmath21 within the cluster rest frame 0.5 - 2.0  kev band . in the conversion from count rate to physical flux units we use pros , assume a raymond - smith spectrum with the published mean temperature @xmath22 and @xmath23 cosmic abundances ( @xcite ) .",
    "we convert between the angular size and physical size of the isophotal region using the angular diameter distance , and we also correct @xmath20 for cosmological dimming @xmath24 .",
    "the best fit power law to this local st relation has the form @xmath25 and the scatter about this relation is 15% in @xmath17 .",
    "this fit is shown as a solid line in fig [ fig : stnearby ] . because this is the local st relation , it is only weakly dependent on the deceleration parameter . for this relation",
    "we have assumed the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath26 ; for @xmath8 and @xmath5 the normalization is 1.8% lower , and for @xmath4 the normalization is 2.7% lower .",
    "galaxy cluster scaling relations between , for example , virial mass and temperature @xmath27 are expected if clusters are approximately virialized .",
    "the spherical collapse model predicts that newly collapsed objects will have mean densities which are @xmath28 times the critical density @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the hubble parameter and in an einstein - de  sitter model @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , we define the virial radius @xmath32 of an object with virial mass @xmath33 to be @xmath34 newly collapsed clusters may also satisfy the virial relation @xmath35 where @xmath27 is the virial temperature and @xmath36 is a number dependent on the cluster density and temperature structure ; in the case that cluster structure is self similar ( i.e. that massive clusters are simply rescaled versions of low mass clusters ) @xmath36 will be constant for all @xmath27 and eqns [ eq : rdelta ] and [ eq : virial ] lead to the well known scaling relations between virial mass , radius and temperature @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a dimensionless structure parameter like @xmath36 .",
    "these scaling relations are expected to hold for a range of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath39 is the region with enclosed overdensity @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 and @xmath40 is the corresponding enclosed mass .",
    "numerical cluster simulations indicate that the emission weighted mean icm temperature  is an adequate proxy for the virial temperature @xmath27 , and that these scaling relations exist even in cluster populations which exhibit merging and substructure ( @xcite ) . using simulations to normalize these relations",
    ", one finds that clusters with  of 10  kev have virial masses @xmath43 and virial radii @xmath44 .",
    "the small scatter in the observed st relation , the correlation between icm mass and temperature ( see section 1 ) , and a direct study of the correlation between binding mass ( estimated using cluster galaxy kinematics ) and emission weighted temperature ( @xcite ) provide evidence that the conditions required for eqn [ eq : scaling ] to be valid are generally met in real galaxy clusters .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness ( units : ergs  s@xmath45@xmath46sr@xmath45 ) at a projected radius @xmath47 from the cluster center is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the electron and proton number densities , @xmath51 is the distance from the cluster center and @xmath52 is the x - ray emission coefficient which includes contributions from thermal bremsstrahlung and line emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can express the icm density @xmath53 in terms of the underlying dark matter density @xmath54 : @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the icm mass fraction within the virial region and @xmath57 is a function describing differences in the dark matter and icm density distributions ; then , using @xmath58 , we can rewrite the x - ray surface brightness as @xmath59 we bring the emission coefficient out of the integral and use the value at @xmath60 ; although this is only strictly valid for an isothermal gas , the temperature insensitivity of @xmath52 band limited to 0.5:2.0  kev makes this an excellent approximation even in the presence of departures from isothermality ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we express the dark matter density profile in terms of the characteristic overdensity of the virial region : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 encodes the dependence of the dark matter profile on a dimensionless radius @xmath63 ; this approach is consistent with numerical cluster simulations , which indicate that cluster dark matter density profiles have a `` universal '' form ( @xcite , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "more recently , higher resolution simulations have shown differences between the inner profile ( at radii which are 1% of the virial radius ) and the form proposed by nfw ( @xcite ) ; these differences appear to be smallest for cluster scale haloes , and none of our conclusions are sensitive to the behavior of the density profile at 1% of the virial radius . expressing @xmath54 in this way , and removing the characteristic scale @xmath47 from the integral , the x - ray surface brightness becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a dimensionless integral which encodes the shape of the icm density profile : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we relate @xmath47 and @xmath17 using the shape of the typical x - ray surface brightness profile ; @xmath69 is typically well fit by the so - called @xmath70 model ( @xcite ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the core radius ; well outside the core the surface brightness falls as @xmath73 .",
    "therefore we write @xmath74 using eqn .",
    "[ eq : scaling ] to substitute  for @xmath47 , one can readily determine the st relation at a particular redshift in the case that cluster structure is self similar @xmath75 for @xmath76 , a typical observed value ( @xcite ) , the predicted st relation has @xmath77 , shallower than the observed relation : @xmath78 .",
    "the observed increase in icm mass fraction @xmath56 with cluster temperature  ( @xcite ) is enough to explain the steepness of the observed relation .",
    "the physics underlying this systematic variation in cluster gas mass fraction is likely heating of the intergalactic medium during the process of galaxy formation .",
    "this so - called preheating affects the structure of the gas in low mass clusters more so than in high mass clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed below , in comparing the local and intermediate redshift st relations it is important only that the effects of this preheating be similar in both samples .",
    "before presenting the intermediate redshift st relation , we present an evolution model and our measurement methods .",
    "comparison of st relations in nearby and distant populations requires a model for how the expected changes in cluster structure with increasing redshift will affect the st relation . in the previous section we presented an explanation of the correlation between cluster",
    "x  ray isophotal size and emission weighted icm temperature  as a manifestation of underlying scaling relations in the dark matter properties of the cluster .",
    "following this line of reasoning , we now express the evolution of the st relation in terms of the redshift evolution of these same dark matter properties .",
    "the evolution of the dark matter scaling relations is apparent in eqn [ eq : scaling ] .",
    "the normalization of these scaling relations changes with redshift according to the change in @xmath42 and the change in the characteristic overdensity @xmath28 of collapsed haloes . within einstein - de",
    "sitter models @xmath28 does not evolve , whereas evolution is expected in low @xmath2 models .",
    "for simplicity of presentation , in the following analysis we explicitly follow only changes in @xmath42 , but accounting for changes in @xmath28 would not affect our conclusions . using @xmath79 , we express the evolution of the mass and size scaling relations as @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the present epoch contributions to the density parameter from matter and `` dark energy '' , respectively .",
    "these simple evolution models are valid only for self similar evolution i.e. in the case that distant cluster dark matter profiles are structurally similar to those of nearby clusters .    from eqn [ eq : idelta ]",
    "it follows that the x - ray surface brightness at @xmath47 evolves as @xmath82 and that the normalization of the st relation evolves as @xmath83 interestingly , for the most common cluster profile @xmath76 ( local : @xcite ; this intermediate redshift sample : @xmath84 ) , so @xmath85 , corresponding to no evolution in the st relation .",
    "in essence , a cluster of a given  is denser in the past , boosting its x - ray surface brightness and tending to increase the isophotal radius @xmath17 , but this cluster is also smaller in the past , tending to decrease the isophotal radius @xmath17 .",
    "if the icm density profile behaves as @xmath86 , these two effects cancel .",
    "thus , a population of clusters with measured @xmath87 will exhibit an st relation which is relatively insensitive to cosmological evolution . in principle",
    ", this behavior makes the st relation ideal for measuring angular diameter distances to high redshift clusters .",
    "we use archival rosat hri observations of 11 of the 14 cnoc clusters discussed in lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; these 11 clusters are those with published   measurements .",
    "a detailed description of the reduction to 0.5@xmath88 pixel images is given in lewis et al .",
    "the hri angular resolution is @xmath89 fwhm ; we further bin these images to a final pixel size of 2@xmath88 without significant loss of angular resolution . despite the far higher median exposure time",
    "( 33  ks compared to 8  ks ) , the image quality of these intermediate redshift clusters is far lower than for our nearby sample ( due to combination of lower observer frame surface brightness and higher instrument background ) .",
    "the image quality is too poor to allow isophotal sizes measurements directly from the images using the approach described in @xmath12[sec : localst ] ; therefore , we fit circular @xmath70 models ( same form as eqn [ eq : beta ] with @xmath90 substituted for @xmath91 ) to these images using the software developed for measuring sze+x - ray distances ( @xcite ) .",
    "essentially , we find the set of parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath70 , cluster centroid @xmath94 and local background @xmath95 which maximizes the likelihood of consistency between model and data .",
    "in all these fits we fix the background to the value measured in an annulus extending from 4.5@xmath96 to 5@xmath96 , a background dominated region with an essentially negligible contribution from the cluster .",
    "fits are performed to the central portion ( @xmath97 ) of the image which includes the cluster and a local background region . in table",
    "[ tab : fitparam ] we list the best fit parameters with estimates of the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the central surface brightness and measured background are both given in detector units of cts  s@xmath45arcmin@xmath98 .",
    "these cluster parameters are in reasonably good agreement with those presented in lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , with the exception of two clusters a2390 and ms1358 .",
    "the different best fit parameters in these two clusters stem from the treatment of emission excesses ; we fit the surface brightness model to the entire dataset , whereas lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) exclude the central region in both these clusters .",
    "this exclusion approach typically leads to larger core radii and correspondingly higher @xmath70 s than would fitting to the entire cluster as in our method .",
    "an examination of the fit residuals in our sample provides no clear evidence for systematic differences between the data and the models with the exception of a2390 , which exhibits an asymmetry or centroid variation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "allowing for an ellipticity introduces two additional free parameters , and the information content of some of the images simply is not sufficient to provide meaningful constraints .",
    "our goal here is to determine whether there is any evidence of regularity in intermediate redshift clusters ; any mismatch between the data and the model ( like that in a2390 ) will serve simply as an additional source of scatter in the final relation . therefore , we conservatively present a uniform and objective analysis which is appropriate for the majority of our sample , rather than varying our analysis from cluster to cluster .",
    "( an elliptical @xmath70 model fit to a2390 yields an isophotal size which is 8% smaller than that listed in table  [ tab : fitparam ] .",
    "this correction makes a2390 more consistent with the best fit st relation , but the correction is unimportant compared to the 17% rms scatter of the sample about that best fit relation . ) of course the best approach is a non - parametric analysis of the surface brightness maps such as that applied to the local sample , but this is not possible with the current data .",

    "it is important that it be measured within the same portion of the virial region in the local and intermediate redshift samples ; this complicates the use of  measurements as cosmological constraints . if one analyzes local and intermediate redshift clusters at a fixed metric aperture , the region studied will correspond to a larger fraction of the virial region as the redshift increases ( see eqn .",

    "if cluster structure evolution is very different from the current theoretical expectation , our model ( @xmath12[sec : stevolve ] ) will underestimate st relation evolution .",
    "for example , a shift in the mean icm mass fraction with redshift would bias st relation distances ; to date there is no compelling evidence that distant clusters have different icm mass fractions in the mean than nearby clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "in addition , we examine the relation for @xmath4 & @xmath5 ( see fig  [ fig : stmidzscdm ] ) , showing that although the slope is consistent , the zeropoint is different at greater than 3@xmath6 significance .",
    "finally , we use this cluster sample and our st relation evolution model to place cosmological constraints . given the quality of the cluster images and temperature measurements ,",
    "it is not surprising that a wide range of cosmological models is consistent with the data .",

    ", the cluster st relation exhibits a slight preference for universes with @xmath188 ; models with @xmath5 are inconsistent with the st relation at between 1 and 2@xmath6 . when considering only models where @xmath7 , we can rule out @xmath4 with 3@xmath6 confidence",
