    "three quarters of a century ago ettore majorana introduced into theoretical physics what are now known as ` majorana fermions ' : particles that , unlike electrons and positrons , constitute their own antiparticles.@xcite the monumental significance of this development required many intervening decades to fully appreciate , and despite being an ` old ' idea majorana fermions remain central to diverse problems across modern physics . in the high - energy context ,",
    "ettore s original suggestion that neutrinos may in fact be majorana fermions endures as a serious proposition even today.@xcite supersymmetric theories further postulate that bosonic particles such as photons have a corresponding majorana ` superpartner ' that may provide one of the keys to the dark matter puzzle.@xcite experiments at the large hadron collider are well - positioned to critically test these predictions in the near future .",
    "condensed matter physicists , too , are fervently chasing majorana s vision in a wide variety of solid state systems , motivated both by the pursuit of exotic fundamental physics and quantum computing applications .",
    "while a definitive sighting of majorana fermions has yet to be reported in any setting , there is palpable optimism in the condensed matter community that this may soon change.@xcite    unlike the majorana fermions sought by high - energy physicists , those pursued in solid state systems are not fundamental particles  the constituents of condensed matter are , inescapably , ordinary electrons and ions .",
    "this fact severely constrains the likely avenues of success in this search . in conventional metals , for example , electron and hole excitations can annihilate , but since they carry opposite charge are certainly not majorana fermions . in operator language",
    "this is reflected by the fact that if @xmath1 adds an electron with spin @xmath2 , then its hermitian conjugate @xmath3 is a physically distinct operator that creates a hole .",
    "if majorana is to surface in the solid state it must therefore be in the form of nontrivial _ emergent _ excitations .    superconductors ( and other systems where fermions pair and condense ) provide a natural hunting ground for such excitations . indeed , because cooper pair condensation spontaneously violates charge conservation , quasiparticles in a superconductor involve _",
    "superpositions _ of electrons and holes .",

    "arises from @xmath0-wave - paired electrons carrying opposite spins ; quasiparticle operators then ( schematically ) take the form @xmath4 , which is still physically distinct from @xmath5 . thus",
    "whereas charge prevents majorana from emerging in a metal , spin is the culprit in conventional @xmath0-wave superconductors .    as the preceding discussion suggests , `",
    "spinless ' superconductors_i.e .",
    "_ , paired systems with only one active fermionic species rather than two  provide ideal platforms for majorana fermions . by pauli exclusion ,",
    "cooper pairing in a ` spinless ' metal must occur with odd parity , resulting in @xmath6-wave superconductivity in one dimension ( 1d ) and , in the most relevant case for our purposes , @xmath7 superconductivity in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "these superconductors are quite special : as sec .",
    "[ toymodels ] describes in detail , they realize _ topological phases _ that support exotic excitations at their boundaries and at topological defects.@xcite most importantly , zero - energy modes localize at the ends of a 1d topological @xmath6-wave superconductor@xcite , and bind to superconducting vortices in the 2d @xmath7 case@xcite .",
    "these zero - modes are precisely the condensed matter realization of majorana fermions@xcite that are now being vigorously pursued .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the operator corresponding to one of these modes ( the specific realization is unimportant for now ) .",
    "this object is its own ` anti - particle ' in the sense that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we caution , however , that labeling @xmath8 as a particle  emergent or otherwise  is a misnomer because unlike an ordinary electronic state in a metal there is no meaning to @xmath8 being occupied or unoccupied .",
    "rather , @xmath8 should more appropriately be viewed as a _",
    "fractionalized _ zero - mode comprising ` half ' of a regular fermion .",
    "more precisely , a _ pair _ of majorana zero - modes , say @xmath11 and @xmath12 , must be combined via @xmath13 to obtain a fermionic state with a well - defined occupation number .",
    "while this new operator represents a conventional fermion in that it satisfies @xmath14 and obeys the usual anticommutation relations , @xmath15 remains nontrivial in two critical respects .",
    "first , @xmath11 and @xmath12 may localize arbitrarily far apart from one another ; consequently @xmath15 encodes highly non - local entanglement .",
    "second , one can empty or fill the non - local state described by @xmath15 with no energy cost , resulting in a ground - state degeneracy .",
    "these two properties underpin by far the most interesting consequence of majorana fermions  the emergence of non - abelian statistics .",
    "a brief digression is in order to put this remarkable phenomenon in proper perspective .",
    "exchange statistics characterizes the manner in which many - particle wavefunctions transform under interchange of indistinguishable particles , and is one of the cornerstones of quantum theory .",
    "there indeed exists a rather direct path from particle statistics to the existence of metals , superfluids , superconductors , and many other quantum phases , not to mention the periodic table as we know it.@xcite it has long been appreciated that for topological reasons 2d systems allow for particles whose statistics is neither fermionic nor bosonic.@xcite such _ anyons _ come in two flavors : abelian and non - abelian . upon exchanging abelian anyons  which arise in most fractional quantum hall states@xcite ",
    "the wavefunction acquires a statistical phase @xmath16 that is intermediate between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "non - abelian anyons are far more exotic ( and elusive ) ; under their exchange the wavefunction does not simply acquire a phase factor , but rather can _ change to a fundamentally different quantum state_. as a result subsequent exchanges do not generally commute , hence the term ` non - abelian ' . an important step toward finding experimental realizations of the second flavor came in 1991 when",
    "moore and read introduced a set of ` pfaffian ' trial wavefunctions for fractional quantum hall states that support non - abelian anyons.@xcite several theoretical and experimental works@xcite indicate that the observed quantum hall state at filling factor@xcite @xmath19 may provide the first realization of such a non - abelian phase . read and green@xcite later provided a key breakthrough that in many ways served as a stepping stone for the new directions reviewed here .",
    "in particular , these authors established an intimate connection between the superficially very different moore - read pfaffian states and a topological spinless 2d @xmath7 superconductor  deducing that universal properties of the former such as non - abelian statistics must also be shared by the latter ( which crucially can arise in _ weakly _ interacting systems ) .    with this backdrop",
    "let us now describe how non - abelian statistics arises in a 2d spinless @xmath7 superconductor . consider a setup with @xmath20 vortices binding majorana zero - modes @xmath21 .",
    "one can ( arbitrarily ) combine pairs of majoranas to define @xmath22 fermion operators @xmath23 corresponding to zero - energy states that can be either filled or empty . thus the vortices generate @xmath24 degenerate ground states - fold ground state degeneracy , which is the actual number of states available if fermion parity is fixed . in this review",
    "we will ignore parity restrictions when evaluating ground - state degeneracies . ]",
    "that can be labeled in terms of occupation numbers @xmath25 by @xmath26 suppose that one prepares the system into an arbitrary ground state and then adiabatically exchanges a pair of vortices .",
    "because this process swaps the positions of two majorana modes , each being ` half ' of a fermion , the system generally ends up in a different ground state from which it began .",
    "more formally the exchange unitarily rotates the wavefunction inside of the ground - state manifold in a non - commutative fashion .",
    "the vortices  because of the majorana zero - modes that they bind  therefore exhibit non - abelian statistics.@xcite    one might naively conclude that in this regard the majorana zero - modes bound to the ends of a 1d topological @xmath6-wave superconductor are substantially less interesting than those arising in 2d . after all , exchange statistics of any type is ill - defined in 1d because particles inevitably ` collide ' during the course of an exchange.@xcite this is the root , for instance , of the equivalence between hard - core bosons and fermions in 1d .",
    "fortunately this obstacle can be very simply surmounted by fabricating _",
    "networks _ of 1d superconductors ; envision , say , an array of wires forming junctions , with topological @xmath6-wave superconductors binding majorana zero - modes interspersed at various locations .",
    "such networks allow the positions of majorana zero - modes to be meaningfully exchanged,@xcite which remarkably still gives rise to non - abelian statistics despite the absence of vortices.@xcite thus 1d and 2d topological superconductors can both be appropriately described as non - abelian phases of matter .",
    "[ as an interesting aside , teo and kane first showed that non - abelian statistics can even appear in three dimensions , where exchange has long been assumed to be trivial.@xcite ]    the observation of majorana fermions in condensed matter would certainly constitute a landmark achievement from a fundamental physics standpoint , both because it could mean the first realization of ettore majorana s theoretical discovery and , far more importantly , because of the non - abelian statistics that they harbor",
    ". moreover , success in this search might ultimately prove essential to overcoming one of the grand challenges in the field ",
    "the synthesis of a scalable quantum computer.@xcite the basic idea is that the occupation numbers @xmath27 specifying the degenerate ground states of eq .",
    "( [ degenerategroundstates ] ) can be used to encode ` topological qubits'.@xcite crucially , this quantum information is stored highly non - locally due to the arbitrary spatial separation between pairs of majorana modes corresponding to a given @xmath28 .",
    "suppose now that temperature is low compared to the bulk gap ; if manipulations are carried out adiabatically the system then essentially remains confined to the ground - state manifold .",
    "the user can controllably manipulate the state of the qubit by adiabatically exchanging the positions of majorana modes , owing to the existence of non - abelian statistics . in principle",
    "the environment can also induce ( unwanted ) exchanges , thereby corrupting the qubit , but this happens with extraordinarily low probability due to the non - locality of such processes .",
    "this is the basis of fault - tolerant topological quantum computation schemes that elegantly beat decoherence at the hardware level.@xcite while braiding of majorana fermions alone permits somewhat limited topological quantum information processing,@xcite the additional unprotected operations needed for universal quantum computation come with unusually high error thresholds.@xcite the search for majorana fermions is thus fueled also by the potential for revolutionary technological applications down the road .    in the beginning of this introduction",
    "we noted that researchers are optimistic that this search may soon come to fruition .",
    "one might reasonably wonder why , given that we live in three dimensions , electrons carry spin , and @xmath6-wave pairing is scarce in nature .",
    "to a large extent this optimism stems from the recent revelation that one can engineer low - dimensional topological superconductors by judiciously forming heterostructures with _ conventional _ bulk @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "this new line of attack could eventually lead to ` designer topological phases ' persisting up to relatively high temperatures , perhaps measuring in the 10k range or beyond .",

    ", interactions can even stabilize topological superconductivity at zero magnetic field due to _ spontaneous _ time - reversal symmetry breaking.@xcite generating the topological phase by applying supercurrents as described in ref .   also lowers the critical zeeman field needed .",
    "multichannel wires have been shown by numerous studies to support a 1d topological superconducting state away from the lowest - subband limit.@xcite in this more general setting one simply needs an _ odd _ number of partially occupied bands and a wire whose width does not exceed the coherence length .",
    "the former criterion is rather natural : starting from the topological phase in a single - channel wire , pairs of partially occupied bands can always be adiabatically introduced without closing the gap .",
    "the latter criterion ensures that the induced superconducting phase remains quasi-1d , which is required for the wire to exhibit a substantial gap.@xcite these works are significant in part because multiple subbands are usually occupied in semiconducting wires such as inas and insb .",

    "furthermore , multichannel wires open the door to realizing a topological phase in a variety of other settings , such as gate - defined channels in quantum wells or surface states featuring large spin - orbit coupling@xcite .    even in a multichannel wire accessing the topological phase will require some degree of gating . an interesting possible route to enhancing gate - tunability is to employ periodically modulated structures in which a regular array of superconducting islands contacts the wire.@xcite the basic idea is that gating the wire in the regions between adjacent superconductors may be relatively easy .",
    "although the hamiltonian is rather different from that of the uniform structure considered previously , a topological phase can still arise , which can be understood simply in two limits .",

    "[ 1d_toy_model ] where majorana end - states localize at a _ single _ site .",
    "majorana zero - modes might then be observable in an array consisting of relatively few quantum dots .",
    "one obvious challenge here is the high level of fine - tuning required to reach this regime .",
    "furthermore , strong randomness may pose an issue given that the hopping and pairing parameters presumably depend exponentially on factors such as the width of the superconducting islands , barrier heights , _",
    "etc_.    numerous other interesting variants have been introduced .",
    "hole - doped semiconducting wires  which benefit from a greatly enhanced spin - orbit energy @xmath333 relative to their electron - doped counterparts  comprise one very promising alternative for realizing majorana modes.@xcite carbon nanotubes can also in principle host majoranas despite the fact that obtaining a ` spinless ' regime with proximity - induced pairing is rather nontrivial.@xcite another interesting proposal involves a half - metallic ferromagnetic wire in which only one spin species conducts .",
