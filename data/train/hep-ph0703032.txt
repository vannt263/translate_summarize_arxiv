    "heavy - to - light decays are very important processes in flavor physics .",
    "the successful running of @xmath0 factories babar and belle has enabled the semileptonic @xmath0 decays like @xmath4 to work out the information about the least known cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath5 , for which @xmath6 form factors play the crucial roles .",
    "the same form factors enter the nonleptonic modes such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which are interesting because of the factorization as well as the angles of ckm unitarity triangle .",
    "heavy - to - light decay is also responsible for @xmath9 transitions @xmath10 or @xmath11 , which are good probes for new physics beyond the standard model(sm ) .",
    "however , the theoretical understanding of heavy - to - light transition is quite poor and still controversial .",
    "the transition matrix elements are usually parametrized by the form factors .",
    "they are nonperturbative objects which can not be calculated from first principles , and all the essential features of the decay processes are encoded on them . at large recoil limit where the final state meson energy is sufficiently large ,",
    "these form factors are not independent .",
    "conventionally , there are 3(7 ) decay form factors for @xmath0 to @xmath12 decays , where @xmath12 stands for the pseudoscalar ( vector ) mesons .",
    "the number of independent form factors reduces to 1(2 ) for @xmath13 at large recoil limit @xcite .",
    "this is due to the so called spin - symmetry relations .",
    "it is a common lore that there are two kinematically distinctive contributions to the form factors .",
    "one is the  soft overlap ( or feynman mechanism )  where one of the partons in the daughter meson carries almost all the momentum .",
    "the other is the ",
    "hard scattering  where none of the partons in the daughter meson is in the end - point region of momentum configuration by exchanging hard gluons .",
    "but there is no general agreement on which of the two is the dominant one .",
    "one of the main issue related is the end - point singularity .",
    "contributions of hard gluon exchange with the spectator quarks are described by the convolution integrals involving meson distribution amplitudes ( da ) and some kernel . at the heavy quark and large recoil limit",
    ", the kernel behaves like @xmath14 where @xmath15 is some momentum fraction of the partons while the das of the final state meson do as @xmath16 in their asymptotic forms .",
    "the resulting convolution integral diverges at the end point @xmath17 , and this is called the end - point singularity .    the end - point singularity has been dealt in many different ways in different theoretical frameworks . in perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    "@xcite , the end - point singularity is absent due to the sudakov suppression near the end - point region .",
    "the point is that when one of the partons carries all the momentum , the remaining part of the daughter meson can not shield the color charge of the fast parton , so many gluons should be emitted @xcite .",
    "thus the soft overlap contribution is very suppressed in this picture , and the hard scattering is the dominant contribution .",
    "but the sudakov suppression is not generally accepted in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that the sudakov suppression is not severe at the heavy quark scale @xmath18 gev ( for more recent discussions , see @xcite ) .    on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the problem of end - point singularity is evaded by absorbing the singular terms into the so called  soft form factor  . here",
    "the heavy - light @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is a light meson ) form factors @xmath21 are compactly written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the soft form factors for @xmath20 of energy @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the hard vertex renormalization ; @xmath26 are hard kernels which are convoluted ( @xmath27 ) with the das @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the momentum transfer .",
    "it was shown that the soft form factors @xmath31 satisfy the spin - symmetry relations .",
    "the second term of convolution arises from the hard spectator interactions .",
    "terms involving end - point singularities are already absorbed into @xmath31 , so the remaining convolutions are end - point finite .",
    "they are shown to break the spin - symmetry relations .",
    "the soft form factors @xmath31 are totally nonperturbative objects ; they can not be calculated from first principles , and they contain the end - point singularities .",
    "the meson das @xmath32 are also nonperturbative , but they can be treated systematically and are well understood .",
    "other quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 are perturbatively calculable .",
    "in fact , one of the great merit of eq .",
    "( [ soft ] ) is the perturbative calculability of the hard kernel , @xmath26 .",
    "this is the main philosophy of the qcd factorization @xcite . from the numerical analysis , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that the symmetry breaking convolutions contribute about 10% ; they conclude that heavy - light form factors are largely from the soft form factor .",
    "the advent of the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite shed new lights on the heavy - to - light decays . in this framework ,",
    "the @xmath19 form factors are described as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the hard functions and @xmath36 is the jet function , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the meson decay constants . here",
    "@xmath39 is the scet version of the  soft  form factor . just as in @xcite ,",
    "the end - point singular terms are absorbed into @xmath40 , and as a whole satisfy the spin - symmetry relations .",
    "from the fact that the same form factors enter the nonleptonic two - body @xmath0 decays , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the two contributions of eq .",
    "( [ scet ] ) are comparable in size .",
    "this point differs from the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) analysis @xcite , where the hard scattering contribution is very small .",
    "although the brief summary above shows impressive achievements in heavy - to - light transitions , there are still some ambiguities and confusions .",
    "first of all , the quantity @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ scet ] ) is not ",
    "soft  in the sense that the involved quarks are not in the asymmetric momentum configuration ; it is defined by the _ collinear",
    "_ quarks . in this context , the scet description of eq .",
    "( [ scet ] ) is much closer to the pqcd prediction where the contributions from the asymmetric momentum configuration ( i.e. , soft overlap ) are highly suppressed .",
    "it is very helpful to see how the soft overlap is identified in the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) .",
    "the lcsr has improved their predictions for the @xmath19 form factors @xcite . at tree level after the borel transformation , the weak form factor is proportional to @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the process - dependent amplitude . here",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 is the continuum threshold is a lower limit of the convolution integral .",
    "it scales as @xmath45 ; thus only the highly asymmetric momentum configuration is relevant .",
    "this is nothing but the exact meaning of the soft overlap .",
    "hard spectator interactions as well as the vertex corrections appear at @xmath46 . numerically eq .",
    "( [ lcsr ] ) is dominant compared to the @xmath46 contributions .",
    "recently , a new insight into the heavy - light transition was proposed @xcite .",
    "it was worked out that there is an upper limit on the momentum of the outgoing quark from the weak vertex , less than the maximum recoil energy of @xmath47 . when the heavy quark is changed into the light quark with very high energy via weak interaction",
    ", it suddenly moves through the  brown muck  consisting of the light degrees of freedom .",
    "the situation is very similar to the case when an electron goes through a dense medium , where the cherenkov radiation should occur .",
    "much more similar processes have been studied in the heavy - ion collisions recently .",
    "here an energetic parton enters through a dense hadronic medium , and possible cherenkov gluon radiation has been considered extensively @xcite .",
    "the energy loss due to the cherenkov radiation can be easily calculated : @xmath48~,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the index of refraction .",
    "the nonperturbative nature is encoded in @xmath49 .",
    "the amount of energy loss for heavy - ion collisions varies around @xmath50 gev / fm up to the model .",
    "but it is generally accepted that the energy loss due to the cherenkov radiation is smaller than the normal radiation by multiple scattering .    roughly speaking , the cherenkov energy loss is about @xcite @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the gluon energy",
    ". the total energy loss might be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the flight length of the energetic parton during the formation of @xmath55 .",
    "more precise estimation requires the detailed structure of the index of refraction @xmath49 .",
    "but this naive power counting is enough to give an important message for the soft overlap . if we take into account the cherenkov energy loss , the convolution integral of eq .",
    "( [ lcsr ] ) will be changed into @xmath56 since @xmath57 , the integration domain shrinks severely .",
    "consequently the soft overlap is highly suppressed .",
    "it will be a good phenomenological trade to introduce the cutoff @xmath58 for the nonperturbative @xmath49 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for a natural scale of @xmath59 one gets a compatible result for @xmath60 form factors with other approaches .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this approach to several @xmath3 decays .",
    "the extension is quite straightforward . in the next section ,",
    "the relevant decay form factors are defined and the end - point singularities are identified . in sec .",
    "iii , various form factors are evaluated with the momentum fraction cutoffs , which originate from the cherenkov energy loss .",

    "the specific forms depend on models , but they can also suffer from the end - point singularity with @xmath78 factors . in this work ,",
    "we just concentrate on the problem of @xmath73 for simplicity , because it is conceptually more important .    from this observation , it is commonly argued that heavy - light transition is dominated by the  soft ",

    "note that near the end point where @xmath73 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ; the parton momenta of the outgoing light meson are highly asymmetric .",
    "however , one can not conclude that the soft physics dominates from unphysical divergences .",
    "even worse is that we can not extrapolate the nonperturbative physics from the perturbative analysis .",
    "when @xmath81 is very close to 0 , the offshellness of the exchanged gluon momentum @xmath82 is vanishing , so we are entering the nonperturbative regime . in this case the neglected terms of order @xmath83 become significant , and thus eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) is not reliable any longer .    at this stage",
    ", it will be very interesting to see how the  soft  form factor is treated in scet . in scet",
    "the soft form factor is defined by a series of operators containing _ collinear _ quarks only @xcite .",
    "in other words , energetic final - state meson is described solely by the collinear quarks ; soft+collinear combination is not allowed .",
    "this is also justified by the large rapidity gap in @xcite .",
    "that s the reason why the defining operators have the interaction lagrangians @xmath84 or messenger modes which convert the soft spectator quark ( @xmath30 ) into collinear one ( @xmath85 ) through the exchange of collinear gluons or into the soft - collinear quark . in this sense , there is no soft - overlap contributions in scet _ a priori .",
    "_    this makes a sharp contrast with the works of @xcite where the soft - overlap contribution plays an important role .",
    "also in many literatures the end - point singular terms are absorbed into the soft form factor as in eq .",
    "( [ soft ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus the  soft  form factor @xmath31 contains both soft overlap and hard spectator interactions .",
    "this parametrization is not bad in a viewpoint of the spin symmetry because all the terms in the soft form factor satisfy the spin - symmetry relations .",
    "but it may cause some confusions ; for example , it is not adequate to directly compare @xmath31 with @xmath39 since the soft overlap is included in the former while not in the latter from the construction .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , it might be unfruitful to extract the hard scattering effects from @xmath31 to leave it purely nonperturbative .",
    "however , it is at least conceptually important to separate the soft overlap from the hard scattering when which of the two is dominant matters .",
    "one more profound matter in scet regarding the end - point singularity is double counting .",
    "the phase space region where @xmath73 corresponds to the zero - bin of the collinear momentum , which must be subtracted to avoid double counting @xcite .",
    "the zero - bin subtraction is equivalent to introducing the ir cutoff regulator .    as argued in sec .",
    "i , there is a new possibility for the energy cutoff due to the cherenkov gluon radiation in the full theory .",
    "the origin of this cutoff is of course quite different from that of zero - bin subtraction ; the latter is necessary for an effective theory where the various momentum scales are involved .",
    "it is related to the self - consistency of the effective theory .",
    "but there is a situation where only collinear modes are considered , as in producing energetic light mesons from heavy - light decays . in this case",
    "the zero - bin subtraction corresponds to establishing a cutoff below which one should not enter .",
    "the cherenkov energy loss explains why this must be the case ; the energetic parton can not reach far near end point .",
    "the suppression of soft overlap can be easily seen in eqs .",
    "( [ lcsr ] ) , ( [ cutoff ] ) . in numerical calculations , however , the value of @xmath86 is not so close to 1 .",
    "typically , @xmath87 for @xmath60 .",
    "its deviation from unity is much larger than the usual @xmath88 for @xmath89 mev .",
    "it is very difficult and ambiguous to determine what portion of momentum should be transferred to insure the soft overlap configuration , or to make soft quark collinear .",
    "but it is quite true that eq .",
    "( [ lcsr ] ) contains more than  soft overlap  with @xmath87 in numerics .",
    "furthermore , the approximation in @xcite @xmath90 tends to increase the numerical value compared to the original integral ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this is because @xmath92 is not sufficiently small .",
    "in short , the soft overlap contribution is overestimated in lcsr .",
    "the pure soft overlap contribution comes from the much narrower range of momentum fraction , which would be shrunken again by the cherenkov radiation .",
    "in what follows , we _ assume _ that the soft overlap is negligible because of the cutoff by the cherenkov energy loss .",
