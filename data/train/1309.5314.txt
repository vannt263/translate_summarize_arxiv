    "in recent years , conjugacy played an important role in non - commutative cryptography , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these applications use that is is easy to create elements which are conjugated , but to check whether two given elements are conjugated might be difficult even if the word problem is easy .",
    "in fact , there are groups where the word problem is easy but the conjugacy problem is undecidable @xcite .",
    "frequently , in cryptographic applications the ambient group is fixed .",
    "the focus in this paper is on the conjugacy problem in @xmath6 . in 1969",
    "gilbert baumslag defined the group @xmath6 as an example of a one - relator group which enjoys certain remarkable properties .",
    "it was introduced as an infinite non - cyclic group all of whose finite quotients are cyclic @xcite . in particular , it is not residually finite ; but being one - relator it has a decidable word problem @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath6 is generated by generators @xmath14 and @xmath15 subject to a single relation @xmath16 . another way to understand",
    "@xmath6 is to view it as an hnn extension of the even more prominent baumslag - solitar group @xmath5 .",
    "the group @xmath5 is defined by a single relation @xmath17 where @xmath14 and @xmath18 are generators and a relation @xmath19 results in @xmath6 . indeed , due to @xmath19",
    ", we can remove @xmath18 and we obtain exactly the presentation of @xmath6 above . ] .",
    "the complexity of the word problem and conjugacy problem in @xmath5 are very low ; indeed , we show that they are @xmath7-complete .",
    "however , such a low complexity does not transfer to the complexity of the corresponding problems in hhn - extensions like @xmath6 .",
    "gersten showed that the dehn function of @xmath6 is non - elementary @xcite .",
    "moreover , magnus break - down procedure @xcite on @xmath6 is non - elementary , too .",
    "this means that the time complexity for the standard algorithm to solve the word problem in @xmath6 can not be bounded by any fixed tower of exponentials .",
    "therefore , for many years , @xmath6 was the simplest candidate for a group with an extremely difficult word problem .",
    "however , myasnikov , ushakov , and won showed in @xcite that the word problem of the baumslag group is solvable in polynomial time ! in order to achieve a polynomial time bound they introduced a versatile data structure for integer arithmetic which they called _",
    "power circuit_. the data structure supports + , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , a restricted version of multiplication which includes exponentiation @xmath23 .",
    "thus , by iteration it is possible to represent huge values ( involving the tower function ) by very small circuits .",
    "still , all operations above can be performed in polynomial time . on the other hand",
    "there are notoriously difficult arithmetical problems in power circuits , too .",
    "a very important one is division .",
    "the input are power circuits @xmath24 and @xmath25 representing integers @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; the question is whether @xmath26 divides @xmath27 .",
    "the problem is clearly decidable by converting @xmath26 and @xmath27 into binary ; but this procedure is non - elementary .",
    "so far , no idea for any better algorithm is known .",
    "it is plausible to assume that the problem `` division in power circuits '' has no elementary time complexity at all .    in the present paper",
    "we show a tight relation between the problems `` division in power circuits '' and conjugacy in @xmath6 .",
    "our results concerning the baumslag - solitar group @xmath5 , the baumslag group @xmath6 , its generic case complexity , and division in power circuits are as follows .    *",
    "the conjugacy problem of @xmath5 is @xmath7-complete .",
    "* there is a strongly generic polynomial time algorithm for the conjugacy problem in @xmath6 .",
    "this means , the difficult instances for the algorithm are exponentially sparse , and therefore , on random inputs , conjugacy can be solved efficiently . *",
    "if `` division in power circuits '' is non - elementary in the worst case , then the conjugacy problem in @xmath6 is non - elementary on the average . *",
    "a random walk in the cayley graph of @xmath6 ends with exponentially decreasing probabilityin @xmath5 .",
    "in other terms , the schreier graph of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath5 is non - amenable .",
    "decidability of the conjugacy problemin @xmath6 is not new , it was shown in @xcite and decidability outside a so - called `` black hole '' follows already from @xcite .",
    "our work improves beese s work leading to a polynomial time algorithm outside a proper subset of the `` black hole '' ( and decidability everywhere ) .",
    "thus , our result underlines that in special cases like @xmath6 much better results than stated in @xcite are possible .",
    "let us also note that there are undecidable problems ( hence no finite average case complexity is defined ) , like the halting problem for certain encodings of turing machines , which have generically linear time partial solutions .",
    "however , many of these examples depend on encodings and special purpose constructions . in our case we consider a natural problem where the average case complexity is defined , but the only known algorithm to solve it runs in non - elementary time on the average .",
    "nevertheless , there is a polynomial @xmath28 ( roughly of degree @xmath29 ) such that the probability that the same algorithm requires more than @xmath30 steps on random inputs converges exponentially fast to zero .",
    "the main technical difficulty in establishing a strongly generic polynomial time complexity is to show that a random walk of length @xmath31 in the cayley graph of @xmath6 ends with probabilityless than @xmath32 in the subgroup @xmath5 for some @xmath33 .",
    "random walks in infinite graphs are widely studied in various areas , see e.g.  @xcite or the textbook @xcite . in",
    "we prove a general statement about hnn extension of the form @xmath8 with a finitely generated base group @xmath9 and @xmath34 a finite symmetric set of generators for @xmath2 .",
    "we show that the complement of @xmath9 ( inside @xmath35 ) is strongly generic if and only if@xmath10 . with other words ,",
    "the schreier graph @xmath36 is non - amenable if and only if @xmath37 .",
    "( for a definition of amenability and its equivalent characterizations see e.g.@xcite . )",
    "this applies to @xmath6 because it is an hnn extension where @xmath10 .",
    "however , in the special case of @xmath6 we can also apply a technique quite different from the general approach . in",
    "we define a `` pairing '' between random walks in the cayley graph and dyck words .",
    "we exhibit an @xmath38 such that for each dyck word @xmath39 of length @xmath40 the probabilitythat a pairing with @xmath39 evaluates to @xmath41 is bounded by @xmath42 .",

    "we refer to @xcite where the foundations of this theory were developed and to @xcite for applications in cryptography .",
    "the notion of _ generic complexity _ refers to partial algorithms which are defined on a ( strongly ) generic set @xmath76 .",
    "thus , they may refuse to give an answer outside @xmath77 , but if they give an answer , the answer must always be correct . in our context",
