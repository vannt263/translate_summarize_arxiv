    "a dramatic advance in the study of galaxy formation over the last decade has been the delineation of the cosmic star formation rate density ( the star formation history of the universe ; sfhu ) to a look - back time within 0.6 gyr of the big bang ( madau et al . 1996 ;",
    "bouwens et al . 2010 ) .",
    "three main epochs have been identified ( figure 1 ) : the first is a gradual rise during cosmic reionization at @xmath10 to 6 , corresponding to the epoch when light from the first galaxies and quasars reionize the neutral igm that pervaded the universe ( fan et al .",
    "second is the epoch of galaxy assembly at @xmath11 to 3 , when the cosmic star formation rate density peaks , and during which about half the stars in the present day universe form ( marchesini et al .",
    "2009 ) . and",
    "third is the order of magnitude decline in the comoving cosmic star formation rate density from @xmath11 to the present , constituting the inexorable demise of galaxy formation with cosmic time , as we run out of cold gas .",
    "these studies have progressed to the next level of detail , namely the sfhu as a function of galaxy environment , stellar mass , and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "one interesting result is the observation of downsizing in galaxy formation .",
    "this entails the systematic decrease in specific star formation rate ( ssfr ; star formation rate per unit stellar mass ) , with increasing stellar mass ( cowie et al .",
    "downsizing is a manifestation of the general fact that massive galaxies form most of their stars early and quickly , and the more massive , the earlier and quicker .",
    "evidence includes studies of the evolution of the ssfr ( moresco et al .",
    "2010 ) , stellar population synthesis studies of nearby ellipticals ( renzini 2006 ; collins et al . 2009 ) , and the direct observation of evolved , passive galaxies at high @xmath12 ( kurk et al . 2009 ; doherty et al . 2009 ; andreon & huertas - company 2011 ) .    a second interesting result is the shift of the balance of star formation to more actively star forming galaxies with increasing redshift . at @xmath13 ,",
    "the cosmic star formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with star formation rates @xmath14 m@xmath2 year@xmath4 ( fir luminosities @xmath15 l@xmath2 ) . by @xmath16 , the dominant contribution shifts to galaxies forming stars at @xmath17 m@xmath2 year@xmath4 ( murphy et al .",
    "2011 ; magnelli et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the results above are based , for the most part , on observations at optical through near - ir wavelengths . while truly remarkable in scope , optical through near - ir studies of galaxy formation are limited in two fundamental ways .",
    "first , dust obscuration plays a substantial role in determining views of early galaxies , in particular , the most active star forming galaxies .",
    "the average correction factor for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) when deriving total star formation rates from uv luminosity entails a factor five increase from observed to intrinsic star formation rates .",
    "this technique has been refined through the use of uv spectral slopes ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ; daddi et al .",
    "2004 ) .    ) and co line luminosity ( @xmath18 ) for both low and high redshift star forming galaxies ( from wang et al .",
    ", height=283 ]    and second , optical / near - ir studies reveal the stars , but miss the cold molecular gas , the fuel for star formation in galaxies .",
    "there is a well established correlation between the far - ir and co luminosity of galaxies ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this correlation is not surprising , given that stars form in molecular clouds ( bigiel et al .",
    "2011 ) , and it argues that the rapid evolution of star formation with redshift should be reflected in the evolution of the molecular gas content of galaxies .    observations at centimeter through submm wavelengths",
    "solve both these issues .",
    "radio observations probe deep into the earliest , dusty , most active phases of star formation in galaxies .",
    "similarly , cm through submm observations reveal the cool molecular and atomic gas in galaxies .",
    "figure 3 shows an example of these phenomena in a luminous starburst galaxy at @xmath19 .",
    "the contours show the thermal emission from warm dust and the co emission , while the greyscale is the hst i - band image . the dust and gas trace the regions of most active star formation , and these regions are completely obscured in the hst image .",
    "we briefly review some of the observational tools available to study the gas , dust , and star formation in distant galaxies .",
    "figure 4 shows the sed at cm through fir wavelengths of an active star forming galaxy redshifted to @xmath20 .",
    "the cm emission is synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray electrons spiraling in interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "these electrons are accelerated in supernova remnant shocks , and hence the radio luminosity will be proportional to the massive star formation rate . the fir emission is from dust heated by the interstellar radiation field , which in active star forming galaxies is dominated by massive stars .",
    "hence , both the fir and radio emission are a function of the massive star formation rate , resulting in the well quantified correlation between the radio and fir luminosity from galaxies ( yun et al .",
    "while the tightness and linearity of the relationship over such a large range in luminosity remains puzzling , this correlation is an important tool for studying dust obscured star formation in galaxies , providing two means for estimating massive star formation rates in distant galaxies",
    ". studies of galaxies at least out to @xmath21 show that the correlation remains unchanged ( bourne et al .",
    "2011 ) , although at the highest redshifts it may be inevitable that inverse compton scattering losses off the cmb by the relativistic electrons leads to a departure from the low @xmath12 relationship ( carilli et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "an important point is that fir emission peaks around 100@xmath22 m . for high redshift galaxies , this emission shifts into the submm bands .",
    "a related point is the well studied inverse - k correction in the submm : the rapid rise in luminosity density on the rayleigh - jeans side of the modified grey body emission curve offsets distance losses , leading to a roughly constant observed flux density with redshift for a fixed observing frequency and intrinsic luminosity ( blain et al 2002 ) .",
    "in essence , submm observations provide a distance independent method with which to study star forming galaxies .    for reference , for a typical dust temperature of @xmath23k , the relationships between observed 350 ghz flux density ( @xmath24 , in mjy ) , dust mass , integrated far - ir luminosity , and total star formation rate ( sfr ; chabrier imf ) are approximately :    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27      a rich spectrum of rotational transitions of common molecules redshifts into the cm and mm bands for distant galaxies ( figure 4 ) .",
    "most prominent are the emission lines from co. co has long been used as a tracer for the total molecular gas mass ( dominated by h@xmath5 ) :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the co luminosity to h@xmath5 mass conversion factor . the units for @xmath18 are k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath30 .",
    "these units were originally designed for spatially resolving observations of co in the galaxy , where brightness temperature was paramount .",
    "values of the co luminosity to h@xmath5 mass conversion factor @xmath29 , range from 0.8 m@xmath2/[k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath30 ] for luminous starburst nuclei in nearby galaxies , to 3.6 m@xmath32[k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath30 ] for milky way - type spiral disks . since the co emission is optically thick on small scales ( ie .",
    "molecular cloud cores ) , @xmath29 is calibrated essentially based on dynamical measures of masses , from virialized gmcs to gas dominated rotating disks in starburst nuclei ( downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "there is evidence for both values in the different populations of high @xmath12 galaxies , again separated according to compact starbursts and star forming disk galaxies ( daddi et al 2010b ; tacconi et al .",

    "the relationship is :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the rest frequency in ghz .",

    "* observations of high dipole moment molecules , such as hcn and hco+ , provide an estimate of the dense gas content of galaxies ( @xmath42 @xmath43 ) .",
    "the atomic fine structure lines are emitted predominantly in the rest frame fir , and hence redshift into the submm range for distant galaxies ( figure 4 ) .",
    "being metastable transitions , and hence typically optically thin , these lines , and in particular the [ cii ] 158@xmath22 m line , are the principle coolant of interstellar gas ( spitzer 1998 ) .",
