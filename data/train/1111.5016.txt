    "in the solar system the sun s equatorial plane is aligned to within @xmath3 with the ecliptic . for many stars in systems with close - in gas giants ( `` hot - jupiters '' ) ,",
    "this is not the case . over the last three years it was found that some hot jupiters have highly inclined or even retrograde orbits with respect to the rotational spins of their host stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "understanding what causes these orbital tilts and why some hot jupiters are well - aligned with their parent stars might aid our understanding of why these giant planets are found so close to their host stars , compared to jupiter .",
    "different classes of processes have been proposed which might transport giant planets from their presumed birthplaces at distances of many astronomical units from their host stars , inward to a fraction of an astronomical unit , where we find them .",
    "some of these processes are expected to change the relative orientation between the stellar and orbital spin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others will conserve the relative orientation between orbital and stellar spin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even reduce a misalignment between them @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that close in giant planets tend to have orbits aligned with the stellar spin if the effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) of their host star is @xmath5  k and misaligned otherwise .",
    "@xcite further speculated that this might indicate that _ all _ giant planets are transported inward by processes that create large obliquities . in this picture ,",
    "tidal torques exerted on the star by the close in planet realign the two angular momentum vectors .",
    "the realignment time scale would be short for planets around stars with convective envelopes ( @xmath6k ) , but long if the star does not have a convective envelope ( @xmath7k ) .",
    "adding to this picture , @xcite recently argued that relatively young stars have high obliquities , while older stars are observed to have low obliquities .    here",
    "we present measurements of the spin - orbit angle in the wasp-7 system .",
    "the planet wasp-7b was discovered by @xcite and found to have a mass of 0.96m@xmath8 .",
    "the host star has a mass of 1.28@xmath9 , a projected rotation speed of @xmath10  kms@xmath2 @xcite , an effective temperature of @xmath11k , and a solar metallicity ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "based on the aforementioned pattern , we would expect that our measurement would show a misalignment between orbital and stellar spins .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the following section describes the new spectroscopic data , and the analysis of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "section [ sec : jitter_ecc ] considers some possible explanations for the high level of noise in the radial velocities , including the possibility of an eccentric orbit .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the impact of the radial - velocity noise on the measurement of the stellar obliquity .",
    "this section also presents an attempt to detect the differential rotation of the host star using the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "we observed wasp-7 with the magellan  ii ( clay ) 6.5 m telescope and the planet finder spectrograph ( pfs ; @xcite ) .",
    "we gathered 37 spectra spanning the transit of 2010  august  27/28 .",
    "the integration times were @xmath13min and the complete sequence spanned @xmath14  hr . the stellar spectra were observed through an iodine gas cell , imprinting a dense forest of sharp absorption lines on the stellar spectra to help establish the wavelength scale and instrumental profile . during the transit night , an additional spectrum was obtained without the iodine cell , to serve as a template spectrum for relative radial - velocity ( rv ) determination .",
    "to derive the relative rvs we compared the spectra observed through the iodine cell with the stellar template spectrum multiplied by an iodine template spectrum . the velocity shift of the stellar template as well as the parameters of the point - spread function ( psf ) of the spectrograph are free parameters in this comparison .",
    "the velocity shift of the template that gives the best fit to an observed spectrum represents the measured relative rv .",
    "in particular we used a code based on that of @xcite .",

    "here @xmath17 indicates the stellar rotation speed and @xmath18 the inclination of the stellar spin axis towards the observer .",
    "the rm effect is a spectroscopic distortion of the rotationally - broadened stellar absorption lines , which occurs when a companion star or planet is in front of the star and hides part of the rotating stellar surface from the observer s view .",
    "the position of the distortion on the stellar absorption line depends on the radial velocity of the hidden portion of the stellar surface .",
    "therefore the observed distortion of the stellar absorption lines can be connected to the geometry of the transit .",

    "the effect was observed with a high signal - to - noise ratio . simply from the observation",
    "that the effect is a blueshift throughout the transit , we may obtain some information on the spin - orbit alignment of the system . a qualitative discussion will help in understanding the quantitative analysis to be discussed later in this paper .",
    "if the projections of the stellar and orbital spins were aligned , then the planet would first traverse the half of the stellar surface for which the rotation velocity has a component directed toward the observer ( blueshifted ) .",
    "the blockage of a portion of this blueshifted half of the star would cause the absorption lines to appear slightly redshifted . then , in the second half of the transit , the reverse would be true : the anomalous rv would be a blueshift .",
    "in contrast , the rm effect was observed to be a blueshift throughout the transit .",
    "this implies that the planet s trajectory is entirely over the redshifted half of the star .",
    "the symmetry of the rm signal about the midtransit time provides further information . for a star in uniform rotation ,",
    "the line - of - sight component of the rotation velocity at any point on the photosphere is proportional to the distance from the projected rotation axis ; see , e.g. , p.  461 - 462",
    "of @xcite . therefore if the planet s trajectory is at a constant distance from the projected rotation axis ( i.e.  if the projected orbital and spin axes are perpendicular ) , the hidden velocity component will be nearly constant in time and the only variation in the rm signal arises from limb darkening , which is symmetric about the midtransit time . in fact",
    "this is the only way to produce a time - symmetric rm effect unless the impact parameter is nearly zero , which is not the case for wasp-7 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the projected orbital and spin axes are nearly perpendicular , and since the anomalous rv is a blueshift we expect @xmath129 ( as opposed to @xmath130 ) , using the coordinate system of @xcite . this qualititative conclusion is confirmed by our quantitative analysis discussed below ; but first we must take into account several effects besides rotation that influence the shape of the measured absorption lines .",
    "stellar absorption lines are broadened not only by the doppler shifts due to stellar rotation , but also by random motions of material on the visible stellar surface .",
    "these random motions are often referred to as microturbulence and macroturbulence , depending on whether the length scale of the velocity field is smaller or larger than the length scale over which the optical depth is of order unity ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this picture , the influence of microturbulence can be described by a simple convolution by a gaussian function of an appropriate width with the rotationally - broadened stellar lines .",
    "the effect of the macroturbulence depends on the angle between the line of sight and the local normal to the stellar surface . near the center of the stellar disk ,",
    "the doppler shifts are produced mainly by motions that are radial with respect to the stellar center ; whereas near the stellar limb , the doppler shifts are produced by motions tangential to the stellar surface . therefore modeling this effect",
    "requires a spatial integration over the visible hemisphere . for this purpose",
    "we employ the semi - analytical approach of @xcite .",
    "other contributions to the line width come from collisional broadening , and zeeman splitting .",
    "these effects are small for wasp-7 compared to the other effects , and we describe them by the convolution of the disk - integrated line profiles with a lorentzian function of width @xmath131  kms@xmath2 .      another potentially relevant effect on line profiles is the convective blueshift . at the top of a convective cell , where it meets the photosphere ,",
    "the rising material is hotter and therefore more luminous than the sinking material . due to the dominance of the rising material over the falling material ,",
    "an observer placed vertically above the stellar surface would detect an overall net blueshift in the integrated light .",
    "this effectively outward radial velocity is referred to as the convective blueshift .",
    "when integrating over the visible stellar disk , the convective blueshift from the center of the disk has a maximal effect on the observed radial velocity , while the convective blueshift from points near the stellar limb have a weaker effect because the outward radial velocity has only a small component along the line of sight .",
    "thus , the influence of the convective blueshift is strongest near the center of the line profile , and weaker in the wings of the lines where a substantial portion of the light originates from the stellar limb .",

    "i _ filter , and our best - fitting model .",
    "the lower panel shows the residuals between the data and best - fitting model.,width=302 ]    therefore , the disk - integrated light has not only an overall doppler shift but also an asymmetry in the stellar absorption lines . to describe this",
    ", we employ the model of @xcite .",
    "this model captures the first - order effects of the convective blueshift but ignores a higher - order asymmetry in the absorption lines : the line cores are formed relatively high in the photosphere where turbulent motions may be less important .",
    "as wasp-7 is a relatively hot star , with high turbulent velocities , it seems appropriate to ignore the latter effect ( see figure 17.15 in * ? ? ?",
    "when analyzing the rm effect researchers normally assume the eclipsed star is rotating uniformly ( no differential rotation ) . in the case of wasp-7 , the planet",
    "s trajectory is evidently perpendicular to the projected stellar equator ( see section  [ sec : qualitative ] ) , and therefore spans a wide range of stellar latitudes , and the effects of differential rotation might be expected to be especially important .",
    "ignoring the possibility of differential rotation might lead to a systematic error in the measurement of the projected obliquity .",
    "for a well - aligned system ( @xmath132 ) the effect is much less important because the planet probes only a small range of stellar latitudes over the course of the transit ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have limited empirical knowledge of differential rotation profiles in stars other than the sun , and therefore we have limited ability to predict the impact of differential rotation on our observation of wasp-7 .",
    "one relevant study is by @xcite , who examined differential rotation in slowly - rotating stars ( @xmath133kms@xmath2 ) . in their sample , all stars having a @xmath134 index between @xmath135 and @xmath136 showed signs of differential rotation , while more active stars had no discernible differential rotation .",
    "their sample did not include any quieter stars ( @xmath137 ) . in this context",

    "the one - dimensional marginalized distributions are shown on the sides of the contour plot . ]      in order to develop a model for the anomalous rv produced by the rm effect , we must take into account two other effects : ( 1 ) the stellar absorption lines recorded by the spectrograph are further broadened by the psf of the spectrograph ; and ( 2 ) the measured rvs represent the output of a doppler - measuring code , which is akin to finding the peak of a cross - correlation between a stellar template spectrum obtained outside the transit , and a spectrum observed during the transit .",
    "some researchers neglect the second point , and model the anomalous rv as the shift in the first moment of the model absorption line rather than as the shift in the peak of the cross - correlation function . depending on the system parameters",

    "in addition , as we will see in section  [ sec : jitter_ecc ] , wasp-7 shows a high level of rv noise on a timescale of days , which will introduce trends in the rv over the course of the transit night .",
    "therefore our model allows for rv trends that are linear or quadratic functions of time , in addition to the rm effect and orbital motion .",

    "initially we assume the orbit to be circular , as @xcite found no sign of an orbital eccentricity ( although see section  [ sec : jitter_ecc ] ) .",

    "@xmath215 is a point in time near the middle of our observation sequence .",
    "since allowing for these trends we have relinquished any power to constrain @xmath210 with the data , so we fix @xmath210 at the value reported by @xcite .    the amount of light blocked at any given phase of the transit depends on the location of the chord of the planet s path over the stellar disk , which is parameterized by the cosine of the orbital inclination ( @xmath156 ) , the radius of the star in units of the orbital semimajor axis ( @xmath216 ) , and the radius of the planet relative to the stellar radius ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "we use quadratic limb darkening parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 to parameterize the relative intensity of the stellar surface in the wavelength region of @xmath218-@xmath219 , the spectral region in which the rvs are measured .",

    "this is noteworthy as harps should achieve a greater precision then coralie , if photon noise is the limiting factor , as harps operates in conjunction with a @xmath248 m telescope and coralie with a @xmath249 m telescope .",
    "this suggests that an additional source of rv variations may be present , which dominates the noise budget .",

    "that is particularly true for positive value of @xmath258 .",
    "the 1-d marginalized distributions are shown on the sides of the contour plot . ]",
    "one possible contributing factor to the excess rv noise is that the orbit is actually eccentric , in violation of our modeling assumption of a circular orbit . to investigate this possibility we repeated the mcmc analysis but allowed the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath257 ) and the argument of periastron ( @xmath258 ) to be free parameters .",
    "our stepping parameters were @xmath260 and @xmath261 , which have less correlated uncertainties for small eccentricity , and which correspond to a flat prior in @xmath257 .    using the likelihood based on equation  [ equ : orbit_mcmc ] , we derived the posterior probability , which is displayed in the @xmath258@xmath257 plane in figure  [ fig : wasp7_omega_ecc ] .",
    "the rms for the best fitting eccentric solution is with @xmath262  ms@xmath2 , only moderately smaller than for the circular - orbit model .",
    "we can see from figure  [ fig : wasp7_omega_ecc ] that there is no clear detection of an eccentric orbit and that solutions with @xmath263 are generally disfavored except for values of @xmath258 near @xmath264 , for which somewhat larger eccentricities are allowed .",
    "such an argument of periastron would indicate for transiting systems a semi - major axis closely aligned with the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "interestingly , such an orbital orientation would lead to a steeper rv slope during the transit night , which is indeed what was observed with the pfs .",
    "however , the peak in the probability density near @xmath265 should not be taken as evidence that the orbit really does have this orientation .",
    "this is probably just the result of the fact that rv studies are better at constraining @xmath266 than @xmath267 , and consequently we expect the confidence interval for @xmath257 to be larger for @xmath258 close to @xmath268",
    ". such an orbital configuration would lead to symmetric rv curves even for an eccentric orbit , i.e. , the rv amplitudes at the quadratures would not differ .",
    "to investigate this point further we conducted numerical experiments similar to those carried out by @xcite for the hd209458 system .",
    "we created simulated rv datasets with the same time stamps as the coralie and harps data sets .",
    "for this we assumed a circular orbit with the parameters of the wasp-7 system .",
    "we then added gaussian perturbations to the model rvs , adopting a 1@xmath269 uncertainty of @xmath246  ms@xmath2 , and then used the same mcmc analysis for these mock data as was used for the real data sets .",
    "a typical 2-d posterior resulting from this experiment is shown in figure  [ fig : mook_data_omega_ecc ] .",
    "we found that greater values of @xmath257 are permitted for orbital orientations of @xmath270 .",
    "this should make us suspicious of any low - snr detection of an orbital eccentricity with an @xmath258 of @xmath270 .",
    "we conclude that the out - of - transit rvs give no indication of an eccentric orbit for wasp-7 .",
    "this is in line with the upper limit @xmath271 found by @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath258-dependent sensitivity to @xmath257 is very similar to the @xmath227-dependent sensitivity to @xmath15 that was explicated by @xcite , for low - snr studies of the rm effect . in that case , higher values of the stellar rotation rate ( @xmath272 ) are allowed for @xmath273 and @xmath274 , even when the underlying signal has no rm effect at all .     * results for orbital eccentricity using synthetic data . *",
    "similar to figure  [ fig : wasp7_omega_ecc ] but this time for an mcmc analysis of a synthetic data set which was derived from a circular - orbit model .",
    "the results indicate that higher eccentricities are allowed for @xmath258 near @xmath264 or @xmath130 . ]",
    "our model took into account the possible effects of differential rotation , through the parameters @xmath144 and @xmath275 .",
    "we found that the upper boundary of the posterior distribution for @xmath144 is determined mainly by our prior .",
    "specifically we found @xmath276 , with the prior enforcing @xmath277 ( see table  [ tab : wasp7_results ] ) .",
    "if instead no prior is placed on @xmath144 , then we found that the differential rotation parameter increases to values as high as @xmath278 , much higher than would be expected based on theory and on observations of other stars .",
    "this should make us suspicious . for @xmath279 close to @xmath280 ,",
    "as is the case here , a parameter degeneracy exists between the limb - darkening profile and the degree of differential rotation , because both of those phenomena produce changes to the rm effect that are symmetric in time about the transit midpoint .",
    "perhaps our assumptions are mistaken regarding the stellar limb darkening within the effective observing bandpass . for rm observations",
    "the effective observing bandpass is complicated to describe , depending as it does upon the density of @xmath281 absorption lines .",
    "furthermore , there may be systematic differences between the limb darkening as observed in different absorption lines , and even within a single strong line , as different parts of the absorption lines form in different depths of the stellar photosphere .",
    "nevertheless , the fitted value of the center - to - limb variation ( @xmath282 ) is already quite high ; lowering this value would only cause @xmath144 to converge to _ larger _ values .",
    "the data seem to be demanding a greater variation of the rm effect between the second and third contact than is delivered by the expected amounts of limb darkening and differential rotation .",
    "some possible explanations are :    * the stellar jitter exhibits correlations on the timescale of minutes to hours , which is not taken into account in our model . by fitting a linear and quadratic trend to the rvs",
    ", we have only taken into account correlations on longer timescales . *",
    "if wasp-7 is pulsating then velocity fields on the stellar surface , due to the pulsations , might lead to a different shape of the stellar absorption line than is created by our model , which does not include pulsations .",
    "the planet would occult during its transit different velocity components than expected . for this effect to be important the velocity fields do not need to change on a timescale comparable to the transit . *",
    "another possibility is that our model of the convective blueshift is not correct . for hotter stars there exists a reversed shape in the bisectors ,",
    "although wasp-7 seems to be securely located on the cool side of this granulation boundary ( see fig .",
    "17.18 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the present data we can not determine if one of these or another effect is responsible for the relatively strong variations in the shape of the rm signal .",
    "one should therefore view our particular results for the differential rotation , stellar inclination , and the spectroscopic limb darkening coefficients with some skepticism . including these effects , or some effects with a similar functional form , is however important for a realistic uncertainty estimation of @xmath16 and @xmath15 as we will discuss in the next section .      as expected from the qualitative discussion we find @xmath283 , which is consistent with @xmath280 .",
    "the projected stellar spin axis is lying nearly within the orbital plane .",
    "* dependency of @xmath15 on @xmath18 .",
    "* the gray scale indicates the posterior probability density , marginalized over all other parameters .",
    "the contours represent the 2-d 68.3% , 95% , and 99.73% confidence limits .",
    "the 1-d marginalized distributions are shown on the sides of the contour plot .",
    "one can see the strong correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "this correlation vanishes if no differential rotation is present . ]",
    "we did not use the measurement of the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath284  kms@xmath2 ) by @xcite as a prior constraint .",
    "this is because it is not clear what value of macroturbulence was assumed by those authors , and also because if differential rotation is present then a systematic error could be introduced .",
    "the lack of knowledge on differential rotation and the stellar inclination did lead to an increased confidence interval for @xmath15 .",
    "this can be seen from the figures [ fig : wasp7_mcmc ] and [ fig : wasp7_incl_proj_obli ] .",
    "when the stellar inclination departs from @xmath280 , the planet covers higher stellar latitudes , which have decreased rotational velocities ( and therefore a decreased rm effect ) either at the beginning or end of the transit .",
    "this forces a higher @xmath16 and a change in @xmath15 to compensate for the asymmetry in the transit rv curve .",
    "this degeneracy could be broken if we would have independent information on the stellar inclination .    to estimate @xmath285 we can use the technique of @xcite , involving a comparison of the measured value of @xmath286 with the expected value of @xmath17 for a star of the given age and mass .",
    "schlaufman found for wasp-7 a rotation statistic @xmath287 , indicating that wasp-7 rotates faster then expected for its age and mass .",
    "a @xmath288 near @xmath145 would indicate that the measured @xmath286 is consistent with the expected rotation speed @xmath17 for a star of a given mass and age .",
    "a @xmath288 larger then @xmath145 would indicate an inclination of the stellar spin axis towards the observer .",
    "we repeat his analysis with the new values for @xmath286 , found here using the rm effect ( table  [ tab : wasp7_results ] ) , and the new mass , radius and age values from @xcite . with these we obtain an expected @xmath17 of @xmath289  kms@xmath2 and a rotation statistic @xmath288 of @xmath290 .",
    "this indicates that the projected rotation speed is consistent with a @xmath291 of @xmath292 there is no indication of an inclination of the stellar spin axis towards the observer .",
    "this knowledge could be used as prior knowledge , or more correctly used in the model itself to decrease the uncertainty in the projected obliquity .",
    "however as wasp-7 is at the upper end of the mass range for which @xcite calculated his rotation , mass , age relationship and because of the complications due to differential rotation for which his relation was not calibrated , we decided not to use this knowledge to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath15 .",
    "analyzing the bisectors of the obtained spectra might lead to a reduced scatter , as was done for hat - p-33 by @xcite .",
    "in particular the data taken during the transit night might be informative as the change in the bisectors will be correlated over the course of the night .",
    "if during some nights several rvs would have been obtained then the uncertainty in the orbital parameters of wasp-7 could be reduced in a similar approach to that used by @xcite for corot-7 .",
    "they used data obtained during one night to constrain a part of the orbit and allowed for a drift between different nights .",
    "however this approach requires a substantial amount of data and its success depends on the timescale over which the jitter is correlated , with shorter correlation timescales being advantageous .",
    "as we are mainly interested in the systems obliquity we only note here that the relation by @xcite employing a correlation between @xmath16 and stellar jitter , leads to an expected jitter of @xmath169  ms@xmath2 , similar to the measured value .",
    "we find that in the wasp-7 system the stellar spin axis is strongly misaligned with the planet s orbital axis , by @xmath293 as projected on the sky .",
    "this observation strengthens the correlation found by @xcite and lends support to the idea that systems with close giant planets generally started out with a very broad range of obliquities , and that the observed low obliquities of many systems are a consequence of tidal dissipation .",
    "differential rotation and its imprint on the rm effect holds the promise of measuring not only the projections of stellar obliquities , but also the stellar inclinations .",
    "however , with the current measurement precision and uncertainties in other parameters such as limb darkening , no secure detection of differential rotation in wasp-7 can be made .",
    "we originally thought that wasp-7 might present a good testbed to search for differential rotation via the rm effect , as the misalignment of @xmath280 maximises the rm signal originating from differential rotation .",
    "however for this angle the signal from differential rotation is also strongly correlated with stellar limb darkening .",
    "in addition wasp-7 displays a high degree of stellar jitter .",
    "therefore a system with a quiet star and a more moderate misalignment might be better suited to search for signs of differential rotation in the rm signal .",
