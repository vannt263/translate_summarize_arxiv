    "open clusters are important tools to investigate the galaxy evolution and stellar evolution . due to their accurate parameters ( e.g. age , metallicity , and distance ) , open clusters",
    "can probe the galactic disk and trace the galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite compiled the most complete open cluster sample with metallicity , age , and distance data , as well as kinematic information , available , and presented some statistical analysis on spatial and metallicity distributions .",
    "their result supports the inside - out galactic disk formation mechanism , in which the invoked star formation rate and infall timescale vary with radius .",
    "@xcite used a sample consisting of 654 open clusters to determine the thin - disk scale height , displacement of the sun above the galactic plane , scale length and the open cluster age - distribution function .",
    "the dynamical state of open clusters is complexly determined by the primordial gas expulsion , stellar evolution , dynamics , and the effect of galactic tidal field @xcite : ( 1 ) the primordial expulsion of gas unbinds most of cluster , but a significant fraction of it can condense by two - body interactions to became an open cluster ; ( 2 ) stellar evolution at the early phase causes large mass loss that will result in the disruption of open clusters ; ( 3 ) internal dynamical evolution will result in mass segregation and evaporation of low mass star , and ( 4 ) the galactic tidal force will strip the stars from the open cluster . therefore , the detailed study of the dynamical state of open clusters can examine the stellar evolution theory and galactic dynamics as well as map the galactic tidal field .",
    "the accurate and precise fundamental parameters , structural parameters and mass function are the cornerstone for these investigations .    the photometric system of the beijing  arizona  taiwan ",
    "connecticut ( batc ) multicolour survey consists 15 intermediate - band filters which cover the wavelength range @xmath17 .",
    "this system is designed to avoid most of the known bright and variable night - sky emission lines , and it is suitable to derive spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of objects . before february 2006 ,",
    "a ford aerospace @xmath18 thick ccd camera was applied , which has a pixel size of 15 @xmath19 and a field of view of @xmath20 , resulting in a resolution of @xmath21 .",
    "after february 2006 , a new @xmath22 ccd with a pixel size of 12 @xmath23 m was used with a resolution of @xmath24 pixel@xmath25 @xcite . due to the large field of view and deep photometry of the batc photometric system , it is suitable for investigating open clusters in the milky way .",
    "the batc photometric system has been used to study the membership determination , fundamental parameters , structural parameters and mass function of open clusters such as m67 , m48 , and ngc 7789 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study an old open cluster ngc 188 based on the batc photometric data .",
    "we will derive the fundamental parameters and structural parameters , and discuss the mass function and dynamical state for this open cluster .",
    "the old open cluster ngc 188 has once been regarded as the oldest open cluster in the milky way .",
    "old open clusters are important to understand the early history of the milky way .",
    "owing to its special location @xmath26 and @xmath27 , ngc 188 is less contaminated and easy to be observed .",
    "therefore , since from @xcite many works about ngc 188 have been done .",
    "works about the fundamental parameters of this cluster are listed in table 1 of @xcite and table 1 of this paper . from these tables",
    "we can see that many methods are used to derive the fundamental parameters , and the results are somewhat different .",
    "the age of ngc 188 is from 4.3 gyr to 16 gyr , the metallicity is from @xmath28}=-0.6 $ ] to @xmath29}=0.69 $ ] , the reddening value is from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and the distance is from 1275 pc to 2047 pc .",
    "we consider that , one hand , these scatters result from the reddening - metallicity degeneracy . on the other hand ,",
    "it reflects that different stellar evolutionary models and different photometric data will derive different results .",
    "in addition , quite some works adopted solar metallicity to ngc 188 and derived the other parameters based on this metallicity .",
    "based on the batc photometric data , we will try to find a method to avoid the reddening - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "the color - color diagram based on the photometric data in the four batc bands performs well to this purpose for ngc 188 .",
    "@xcite has derived the structural parameters and mass function ( mf ) , and studied the dynamical evolution of ngc 188 in detail .",
    "in addition , till now only @xcite and @xcite studied the mf break of ngc 188 , however , because of not deep photometry , @xcite and @xcite did not observe the mf break of ngc 188 .",
    "so , in this paper , we will study the dynamical evolution of ngc 188 based on our deeper photometry .",
    "we describe our new observational data and photometric reduction of ngc 188 in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we derive the fundamental parameters of ngc 188 .",
    "the structure of ngc 188 is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the mf and the mass segregation are discussed in section 5 .",
    "a summary is presented in section 6 .",
    "our observations are based on the batc photometric system .",
    "the batc photometric system utilizes the 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope which is at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories , china academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the image of ngc 188 in the batc @xmath32 band .",
    "the details of the batc system are described in @xcite and @xcite . in table 2 , we list the corresponding effective wavelength and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of each filter , and exposure time and the number of frames observed in each filter for our observation .",
    "data reductions are carried out by two procedures called pipeline i and pipeline ii .",
    "these procedures are developed as standard for the batc photometric system .",
    "bias subtraction and field flatting are carried out by pipeline i. instrumental magnitudes of point sources are determined by pipeline ii .",
    "after that , the instrumental magnitudes are calibrated to the batc standard system @xcite . for each filter , the average calibration error is below 0.02 mag . for every image ,",
    "the mean of the fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) is @xmath33 , which critically samples ( @xmath34 pixels ) the psf .",
    "so , the effect of undersampling on our photometric accuracy is not critical . for",
    "each star observed more than once in a batc band , the final photometric result in that band is the weighted mean .",
    "we adopt the proper - motion membership probabilities in table 3 of @xcite for ngc 188 . matching this table and our star catalog ,",
    "we pick up the common stars , which are plotted in figure 2 . in this paper ,",
    "stars whose proper - motions membership probabilities greater than @xmath35 are used to derive the fundamental parameters .",
    "we used the photometric data in the seven batc bands to construct four color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "these combinations are @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 , @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 , @xmath40 vs. @xmath41 , and @xmath42 vs. @xmath43 .",
    "we fit the theoretical batc isochrones ( see section 3.2 ) to our observational data of ngc 188 to derive the fundamental parameters .",
    "stellar evolutionary models from the padova group ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are widely used . in the padova stellar evolutionary models ,",
    "@xcite provided tables of theoretical isochrones in such photometric systems as abmag , stmag , vegamag , and a standard star system .",
    "the complete data - base @xcite covers a very large range of stellar masses ( typically from 0.6 to @xmath44 ) .",
    "these models @xcite are computed with updated opacities and equations of state , and moderate amount of convective overshoot .",
    "however , the isochrones are presented for only 6 initial chemical compositions : @xmath45}=-2.2490 $ ] , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( solar metallicity ) , and @xmath50 , which are evidently not dense enough .",
    "it is fortunate that @xcite provide tables for any intermediate value of age and metallicity via an interactive web interface .      to determine the main characteristics of the population in ngc 188 , we fit isochrones to the cluster cmd .",
    "we used the padova theoretical isochrones in the batc system @xcite . via an interactive web interface ( see section 3.1 ) , we can construct a grid of isochrones for different values of age and metallicity , photometric system , and dust properties .",
    "we use the default models that involve scaled solar abundance ratios ( i.e. , @xmath51}=0.0 $ ] ) . in performing , the chabrier lognormal initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite is adopted .      to determine the reddening value of an open cluster , a method based on the color - color diagram fitting",
    "is usually used . however , in this method , the degeneracy between reddening and metallicity requires that the metallicity is previously known .",
    "for instance , adopting the metallicity of @xmath45=-0.04\\pm0.05}$ ] for ngc 188 , @xcite obtained ngc 188 s reddening to be @xmath52 based on the @xmath53 color - color diagram and the hyades fiducial sequence . assuming a solar metallicity for ngc 188 , @xcite obtained ngc 188 s reddening to be @xmath54 based on the @xmath55 and @xmath56 color - color diagram and the @xcite sdss isochrones .",
    "we derive the reddening of ngc 188 .",
    "table 1 of @xcite and table 1 of this paper list the metallicities of ngc 188 obtained from spectral analysis , which are between @xmath57=-0.12 $ ] and @xmath57=+0.12 $ ] .",
    "we adopted these two values of metallicity to derive the reddening of ngc 188 on the @xmath38 and @xmath40 color - color diagram .",
    "in addition , the resent results showed that the age of ngc 188 is between 6.0 and 8.0 gyr ( see section 3.3 for details ) . in this paper , the reddening @xmath58",
    "is transformed to each batc band using the extinction coefficient derived by @xcite based on the procedure given in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the result obtained for three values of reddening @xmath59 , 0.036 , and 0.082 ( @xmath57=-0.12 $ ] ) . in the left and right panels , the batc isochrones are for 6.0 and 8.0 gyr , respectively . in figure 3 ,",
    "the two vertical dashed lines represent the main - sequence band between @xmath60 and 1.05 , which is the region where the data and isochrones should fit best . from figure 3",
    ", we can see that the best fit of the batc isochrone to the data points was obtained for @xmath61 .",
    "figure 4 shows the result as figure 3 did , but for @xmath57=+0.12 $ ] . from figure 4",
    ", we can also see that the best fit of the batc isochrone to the data points was obtained for @xmath61 . as a result , we arrived at a reddening value of @xmath62 for ngc 188 , where the quoted uncertainty only includes an estimate of the error in the reddening determination .",
    "since the value of reddening has been fixed , we go ahead to determine the other parameters of ngc 188 in the cmds . because of the age - metallicity degeneracy , we can not simultaneously determine age and metallicity by the fitting method .",
    "we adopt a value of metallicity @xmath63=0.12 $ ] in @xcite , which was obtained from spectral analysis of red giants of ngc 188 .",
    "now , fitting the theoretical isochrone to our color - magnitude data points became straightforward .",
    "first , we chose the age for which the fitted isochrone had the same color of the turn - off as our data points .",
    "then , by shifting the isochrone up and down ( changing the distance modulus ) , we finally obtained the best fit .",
    "based on the age obtained by the previous works ( see table 1 of this paper and table 1 of fornal et al .",
    "2007 in detail ) , we used the interactive web in section 3.1 to construct a fine grid of isochrones about ages , sampling an age range @xmath64 gyr at intervals of 0.1 gyr .",
    "the metallicity @xmath65 } = \\log(z / z_\\odot ) = 0.12 $ ] where @xmath66 , so this metallicity corresponds to @xmath67 . using this fine grid of isochrones",
    ", we obtained the fundamental parameters of ngc 188 .",
    "a set of the best fitting parameters for our data is adopted as follows : an age of @xmath68 gyr , and a distance modulus of @xmath69 .",
    "the error of the age of ngc 188 is estimated by eye in the cmds .",
    "figure 5 shows a set of cmds in the batc system for ngc 188 . from figure 5",
    ", we can give an estimate of the error of age to be @xmath70 gyr .",
    "the error of the distance modulus is also estimated by eye in the cmds .",
    "figure 6 shows a set of cmds in the batc system for ngc 188 . from figure 6",
    ", we can give an estimate of the error of distance modulus to be @xmath71 .",
    "we compare our best fitting parameters for ngc 188 with those of previous studies in the past two decade . for reddening @xmath58 , many works ( see table 1 of fornal et al .",
    "2007 ) obtained the values of reddening to be larger than @xmath72 .",
    "our best fitting result of @xmath73 is in very agreement with those in @xcite , who obtained the values of reddening to be 0.03 and 0.04 .",
    "our result is also consistent with that of @xcite , who obtained the value of reddening to be @xmath74 . for age , our best fitting of @xmath75 gyr is consistent with those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who obtained the ages of ngc 188 to be 7.5 gyr and 7.0 gyr , @xmath76 gyr , and @xmath77 gyr , respectively . for distance modulus @xmath78 , our best fitting of @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 )",

    "the structure of a cluster is described by means of the radial surface density profile , which is defined as the projected number of stars per area in the direction of the cluster . in this paper",
    "we adopt the empirical formula derived by @xcite to fit the radial surface density profile of ngc 188 .    in order to enlarge the number of member stars of ngc 188",
