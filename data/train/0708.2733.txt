    ", a source node wishes to transmit confidential information to a destination node and wishes to keep a wire - tapper as ignorant of this information as possible .",
    "the performance measure of interest is the secrecy capacity , which is the largest reliable communication rate from the source node to the destination node with the wire - tapper obtaining no information . for the wire - tap channel where the channel from the source node to the destination and the wire - tapper is degraded ,",
    "the secrecy capacity was given in @xcite for the discrete memoryless channel and in @xcite for the gaussian channel .",
    "the general wire - tap channel without a degradedness assumption and with an additional common message for both the destination node and the wire - tapper was considered in @xcite , where the capacity - equivocation region and the secrecy capacity were given .",
    "the wire - tap channel was also considered recently for the fading and multiple antenna channels in @xcite .",
    "the secrecy capacity was addressed either for the case with a fixed fading state or from the outage probability viewpoint .    in this paper , we study the ergodic secrecy capacity of the fading wire - tap channel , which is the maximum secrecy rate that can be achieved over multiple fading states . we assume the fading gain coefficients of the source - to - destination channel and the source - to - wire - tapper channel are stationary and ergodic over time .",
    "we also assume both the transmitter and the receiver know the channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "note that the csi of the source - to - wire - tapper channel at the source can be justified as follows . in wireless networks ,",
    "a node may be treated as a  wire - tapper \" by a source node because it is not the intended destination of particular confidential messages . in this case , the  wire - tapper \" is not a hostile node , and may also expect its own information from the same source node . hence it is reasonable to assume that this  wire - tapper \" feeds back the csi to the source node .",
    "the fading wire - tap channel can be viewed as a special case of the parallel wire - tap channel with independent subchannels in that the channel at each fading state realization corresponds to one subchannel .",
    "hence we first study a parallel wire - tap channel with @xmath0 independent subchannels .",
    "each subchannel is assumed to be a general broadcast channel and is not necessarily degraded , which is different from the model studied in @xcite .",
    "this channel model also differs from the model studied in @xcite in that the wire - tapper can receive outputs from all subchannels .",
    "the secrecy capacity of the parallel wire - tap channel is established .",
    "this result then specializes to the secrecy capacity of a parallel wire - tap channel with @xmath1 degraded subchannels , which is directly related to the fading wire - tap channel . for this model , we assume each of the @xmath2 subchannels satisfies the condition that the output at the wire - tapper is a degraded version of the output at the destination node , and each of the @xmath3 subchannels satisfies the condition that the output at the destination node is a degraded version of the output at the wire - tapper . we show that to achieve the secrecy capacity , it is optimal to keep the inputs to the @xmath3 subchannels null , i.e. , use only the @xmath2 subchannels , and choose the inputs to the @xmath2 subchannels independently .",
    "therefore , the secrecy capacity reduces to the sum of the secrecy capacities of the @xmath2 subchannels .",
    "we further apply our result to obtain the secrecy capacity of the fading wire - tap channel .",
    "the fading wire - tap channel we study differs from the parallel gaussian wire - tap channel studied in @xcite in that we assume the source node is subject to an average power constraint over all fading state realization instead of each subchannel ( channel corresponding to one fading state realization ) being subject to a power constraint as assumed in @xcite .",
    "since the source node knows the csi , it needs to optimize the power allocation among fading states to achieve the secrecy capacity .",
    "we obtain the optimal power allocation scheme , where the source node uses more power when the source - to - destination channel experiences a larger fading gain and the source - to - wire - tapper channel has a smaller fading gain .",
