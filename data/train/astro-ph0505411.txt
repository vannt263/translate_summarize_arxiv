    "star clusters form out of collapsing cloud clumps in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "these collapses are triggered by turbulent fragmentation of clouds and their clumps @xcite .",
    "the clumps are observed to be aligned in filamentary structures that can be reproduced by supersonic turbulent simulations and they contain many cores @xcite .",
    "each core forms a single star or a binary .",
    "the mass function found for these cores is essentially the same as the initial mass function of the stars @xcite . while the star formation efficiency ( sfe ; i.e.  the fraction of gas which ends up in the star(s ) ) in these cores is high ,",
    "the overall sfe measured over the whole molecular cloud is very low , of the order of a few per cent @xcite , and @xmath3  per cent in cluster forming clumps ( i.e.  embedded star clusters ; * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining gas does not stay in the newborn star cluster but is driven outwards by stellar feedback . in embedded clusters containing more than a few hundred stars the feedback consists of photo - ionising radiation , the winds of high - mass stars and finally the on - set of the first supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "for such clusters the feedback energy can easily be sufficient to unbind the gas leading to a gas expulsion phase which is rather short , comparable to the crossing time of the star cluster .",
    "pictures of young massive star clusters , for example in the central region of the antennae ( ngc  4038/4039 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reveal that they are already surrounded by h-@xmath4 bubbles stemming from the gas which was blown out of the star cluster .",
    "it has been shown that these star clusters can be as young as @xmath5@xmath6  myr .",
    "the outflow velocities of the gas has been measured to be @xmath7@xmath8  kms@xmath9 @xcite , which corresponds to gas - evacuation times of @xmath10  myr for cluster radii of @xmath11  pc .",
    "this is comparable to the crossing time of a @xmath12  m@xmath13 cluster .    as a result of this strong and rapid mass - loss the star cluster",
    "is left out of virial equilibrium .",
    "the velocities of the stars are too high for the reduced mass of the star cluster .",
    "so even more mass is lost when stars escape from the star cluster .",
    "this may finally lead to the complete dissolution of the cluster .",
    "but if the star formation efficiency is as high as @xmath0  per cent or above , a small bound core remains @xcite and today we therefore understand the formation of low - mass , pleiades - type clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the sfe has to be larger than @xmath14  per cent to get a bound core but if the stars have almost no initial velocity dispersion then @xmath15  per cent could be enough .",
    "this means that the measurement of the initial velocity distribution in newborn embedded star clusters will be crucial to find out if and how star clusters survive .",
    "as seen in the beautiful hst images of the central region of the antennae galaxies @xcite , star clusters in strong star bursts do not form in isolation but rather in star cluster complexes .",
    "these are confined regions of several hundred parsecs containing dozens and up to hundreds of young massive star clusters @xcite .    following the arguments of @xcite",
    "these star cluster complexes are bound entities and should be close to virial equilibrium .",
    "even though they are quite young ( in the antennae @xmath16  myr ) they should be already more dispersed and not centrally concentrated anymore if they are unbound , or almost all clusters should be merged in the centre if they are sub - virial . until now",
    "there is no observational measurement of the velocity dispersion in the cluster complex available .",
    "observers have only measured the velocity dispersions of the star clusters . however , the difference in radial velocity of two star clusters in the same cluster complex ( @xmath17  kms@xmath9 ) is in good agreement with the assumption that the complex is a bound entity .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the birth of massive star clusters in such extreme environments .",
    "our aim is to understand what rle star cluster complexes , with their collective potential and the ability for the star clusters to merge with each other on short timescales @xcite , have for retaining a bound core .    in the next section",
    "we describe the code we are using and the setup of our models .",
    "then we present our results followed with a discussion .",
    "we use the particle - mesh code superbox @xcite which allows us to keep track of many objects in one simulation .",
    "this code has a hierarchical grid structure where the high - resolution sub - grids stay focused on the simulated objects while they move through the simulation area .",
    "each grid contains @xmath18 grid - cells in this simulation .",
    "this enables us to resolve the forces between the star clusters as well as the forces within a star cluster correctly .",
    "we choose the grids of superbox in a way that the innermost grid - level with the highest resolution ( @xmath19  pc per cell ) covers each star cluster , while the medium resolution grids ( @xmath20  pc per cell ) have the size of the star cluster complex .",
    "finally the outermost grid ( @xmath21  pc per cell ) covers the whole orbit of the star cluster complex around the host galaxy .",
    "the time - step of our simulations was chosen to be @xmath22  myr which ensures enough time - steps per crossing time of the single clusters ( @xmath23 per crossing - time ) and of the dense star cluster complex ( @xmath24 per crossing - time ) .",
    "the cpu time needed was about @xmath25  sec per time - step , or about @xmath15  days for a @xmath26  gyr simulation ( on standard desktop pcs ) .",
    "the single star clusters are represented by plummer spheres with a plummer radius of @xmath11  pc and a cut - off radius of @xmath7  pc .",
    "each cluster has a mass of @xmath12  m@xmath13 initially , a crossing time of @xmath27  myr and is represented with 100,000 particles .",
    "@xmath2 of these clusters are placed in a star cluster complex which is modelled again as a plummer distribution ( i.e. positions and velocities according to the plummer distribution function ) , now with the star clusters as particles. this plummer distribution is given a plummer radius of @xmath2  pc , a cut - off radius of @xmath28  pc , a crossing time of @xmath29  myr and a characteristic velocity dispersion of @xmath30  kms@xmath9 .",
    "this is a very dense configuration which will lead to a fast merging of the star clusters into one massive merger object , if mass - loss is not taken into account .",
    "it also implies that the star clusters as well as the star cluster complex is in virial equilibrium before the gas - expulsion .",
    "the initial conditions of our cluster complex are comparable to the cluster complexes in the central regions of the antennae galaxies only in a qualitative way .",
    "however , cluster complexes are not only found in the central star bursts of interacting galaxies like the antennae , but also in tidal tails ( e.g.  tadpole galaxies , stephan s quintet and also the antennae ) and in more quiescent galaxies like ngc  6946 @xcite .",
    "they cover a wide range in total mass ( @xmath31@xmath32  m@xmath13 or even higher ) and central concentrations .",
    "the knots in the antennae galaxies are much more massive than our initial conditions and also cover a larger area .",
    "nevertheless the density distribution there is exponential in the inner part and has a power - law drop off in the outer part @xcite .",
    "our models , especially after the merging of the first few clusters show exactly the same behaviour @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] we compare the surface - brightness profiles of our models ( measured at different times using mass - to - light ratios from a single stellar population computed with starburst99 @xcite ) with the profiles found by @xcite for three super - clusters in the antennae .    a detailed discussion about merging time - scales , the effect of tides on the formation of the merging object as well as a discussion of the properties of the merger objects ( without mass - loss ) in general is found in our previous papers @xcite .    for our simulations in this project",
    "we choose a very dense configuration for the star cluster complex . in this case",
    "the merging time - scale becomes comparable to the mass - loss time - scale and the effect of the cluster complex on retaining stars forming an extended merger object should be strongest .",
    "the sfe is varied over a wide range to investigate the influence of this new environment theoretically .    the mass - loss due to gas - expulsion is modelled by all particles loosing a fraction of their mass linearly over a crossing - time of the single star cluster .",
    "we consider two mass - loss models . in the coeval model",
    "every star cluster starts immediately and at the same time to loose mass and in the delayed model the star clusters start to loose their mass randomly during the first crossing time of the super - cluster . while in the coeval cases the star formation rates ( sfr ) range from @xmath33",
    "to @xmath34  m@xmath35yr ( all stars form within a crossing time of a individual cluster ) the delayed models imply sfrs from @xmath36 to @xmath37  m@xmath35yr ( the stars form within the crossing time of the star cluster complex ) . using the crossing time of the cluster complex as",
    "the maximum time delay between the start of the star formation of two individual clusters is in agreement with the analysis of @xcite and their time difference  separation  relation ( see their fig .",
    "the star cluster complex orbits circularly at a distance of @xmath15  kpc around an analytical galactic potential with a flat rotation curve of @xmath38  kms@xmath9 .",
    "first we checked if our approach gives the same results on isolated single clusters as published before by evaluating the remaining bound mass of an isolated cluster after @xmath26  gyr .",
    "the bound mass is computed by calculating the total energy of each particle at each time step . if the kinetic energy of the particle with respect to the star cluster centre exceeds the potential energy derived from the grid - based potentials of superbox the particle is regarded as being unbound .",
    "the results , shown in tab .  [ tab : single ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] , agree with the numbers in the literature @xcite . if the sfe is higher than @xmath0  per cent a small bound core survives .",
    "we get a star cluster which retains more than @xmath14   per cent of its stellar mass if the sfe is about @xmath39@xmath14  per cent . for each sfe value we performed three simulations with different random realisations .",
    "the results of the individual realisations all agreed to better than one per cent .",
    "as a next step we performed simulations with @xmath2  star clusters as described above . in tab .",
    "[ tab : merg ] we give the number of star clusters which have merged ( m ) , the number of clusters which completely dissolve ( d ) , and the number of star clusters which survive as single entities after leaving the potential of the star cluster complex ( s ) . for the bound mass fraction of the merger object ( @xmath40 ) we count the merged clusters as well as the completely dissolved ones .",
    "the mass of the escaped and surviving star clusters ( i.e.  that have neither dissolved nor merged ) is not taken into account .",
    "if one or more star clusters survive we calculate their own bound mass fraction ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the resulting bound mass fractions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] .",
    "again the values are taken after @xmath26  gyr of evolution .    as a first result of our investigation we find that , in contrast to the isolated cluster case , the resulting bound mass fractions have a wide spread . even though we just perform one simulation per parameter set we sometimes find more than one merger object or more than one surviving star cluster . in those cases",
    "a one sigma deviation can be a high as @xmath15  per cent in @xmath42 .",
    "this can be explained by the additional but random destructive tidal forces between the star clusters .",
    "almost all clusters which do not end up inside the merger object have a smaller bound mass than in the isolated case .",
    "there are even star clusters dissolving completely when the sfe is @xmath43  per cent .",
    "on the other hand there are rare cases where single clusters escape and survive even at low star formation efficiencies .",
    "two single clusters escape and survive the coeval simulation with a sfe of @xmath8  per cent .",
    "we analyse one of these surviving star cluster in a sub - section below ( sect .",
    "[ sec : m03 ] ) .",
    "the merger objects in our simulations survive with very low sfe . in the delayed gas expulsion simulations we find a surviving merger object at a sfe of only @xmath2  per cent .",
    "we followed the evolution of the merger object for @xmath15  gyr to see if it survives and which properties it has ( sect .",
    "[ sec : d02 ] ) .    generally speaking the building up of a merger object with its deeper potential well favours the survival of a bound object that retains more of its stars than an isolated single cluster would , as long as the sfe is below @xmath44  per cent ( fig  [ fig : multi ] ) .",
    "if the sfe is higher destructive processes during the merging process lead to a mass - loss , i.e.  stars that are expelled as a result of the kinetic energy surplus produced during the merging of the clusters ( the stars are then found in the tidal tails ) , leaving the remaining object with a smaller bound mass fraction than the star clusters would have had if they would have formed in isolation .",
    "however , as a major result we find that cluster formation in complexes allows star clusters to survive even if the sfe is as low as @xmath2  per cent . in a dense star cluster complex the crossing time of the star clusters through the super - cluster , and therefore the merging time - scale , is short enough that some star clusters have already merged before they expel their gas",
    ". the much deeper potential wells of these merger objects are able to retain the stars more effectively than isolated clusters would .    to show the influence of the richness of the star cluster complex we performed one comparison simulation , where we placed an extended star cluster complex ( plummer - radius of @xmath45  pc and a cut - off radius of @xmath46  kpc ) on an eccentric orbit far out ( apogal : @xmath28  kpc ; perigal : @xmath47  kpc ) .",
    "the complex contains @xmath48 star clusters and has a total mass of @xmath49  m@xmath13 or @xmath50  m@xmath13 after the delayed gas - expulsion ( sfe@xmath51 ) .",
    "this also implies a low star formation rate of only @xmath52  m@xmath53yr .",
    "the crossing - time of this complex is long ( @xmath54  myr ) compared to the gas - expulsion time , which happens on the time - scales of the crossing - time of the single clusters . in this simulation",
    "only two star clusters merge and two get dissolved .",
    "all the other star clusters survive but get dispersed , because the potential of the complex is not deep enough to retain the star clusters after gas - expulsion .",
    "also the merging time - scale which is of the order of a few crossing - times of the complex is too long to prevent the star clusters from leaving the complex .",
    "still , as said above , almost all clusters survive and retain about @xmath55  per cent of their initial mass in stars after one gyr . a magnitude - spaced contour - plot of this simulation is shown in fig  [ fig : w04 ] .      in the randomly delayed gas expulsion experiment the merging process takes place faster than the dissolution of the star clusters",
    "this means there is already a massive merger object with a deeper potential well when the major part of the gas expulsion occurs .",
    "this enables the object to retain a higher fraction of the stars bound to each other .",
    "we followed the evolution of this object for @xmath15  gyr .",
    "after a rapid mass loss during the first few hundred myr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d02 - 1 ] , right panel ) the merger object survives and hosts finally ( after @xmath15  gyr ) about @xmath56  per cent of the initially formed stars .",
    "this amounts in our case to a mass of @xmath57  m@xmath13 , or , adopting a typical mass - to - light ratio for globular clusters of @xmath58 , to an absolute v - band magnitude of @xmath59 .",
    "after a first expansion phase during the first few dozens of myr the expansion is halted by the self - gravity of the object and the particles recollapse again .",
    "it takes a few hundred myr until the object settles down but afterwards it looses mass and shrinks further only slowly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d02 - 1 ] ) .    by @xmath15",
    "gyr the object does not look like an ordinary globular cluster but rather like one of the faint fuzzy star clusters @xcite .",
    "it has no dense core and a large effective radius of about @xmath60  pc .",
    "the half mass radius of the object is @xmath61  pc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d02 - 1 ] left panel ) .",
    "we fit a king profile to the surface density profile with a core radius of @xmath62  pc and a central surface density of @xmath63  m@xmath13pc@xmath64 .",
    "this translates to @xmath65  mag.arcsec@xmath64 ( again in the @xmath66-band ) taking a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath58 .",
    "the tidal radius is @xmath67  pc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d02 - 2 ] left panel ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles can be fitted with an exponential profile with a central value of @xmath68  kms@xmath9 and an effective radius of @xmath47  pc for the line - of - sight velocity dispersions , and @xmath69  kms@xmath9 and @xmath70  pc for the three dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "we also find a steep rise in the dispersions among unbound particles outside the tidal radius .",
    "these extra tidal stars are mainly located in tidal arms leading and trailing the object .      in the coeval simulation with a sfe of @xmath8  per cent",
    "we find two single clusters which do not merge and do not dissolve .",
    "they get kicked out of the potential of the star cluster complex and retain @xmath2  per cent of their stars bound at @xmath71  gyr . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m03 - 1 ] the bound mass fraction of one of them is shown .",
    "clearly visible is a steep increase of the bound mass fraction at about @xmath58  myr . at this time",
    "the star cluster has a close encounter with another star cluster and gets shot out of the cluster complex .",
    "this event shocked the particle distribution and prevented otherwise unbound particles from gaining too much energy and becoming unbound . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m03 - 1 ] we see that this event is almost invisible in the lagrangian radii of the particles .",
    "they still keep on expanding .",
    "the turning point when the remaining particles contract again ( due to their self - gravity ) to form the surviving object is much later ( at about @xmath14  myr ) .",
    "after that the object evolves and looses mass only slowly thereby shrinking in size until final dissolution .    by one gyr the star cluster has a bound mass fraction of @xmath72  per cent which amounts to @xmath73  m@xmath13 .",
    "the bound particles form a core surrounded by a halo of unbound particles .",
    "the core has a tidal radius of about @xmath74  pc .",
    "the shape of the surface brightness profile is best fitted with a king profile in the centre with a core radius of @xmath75  pc and a power - law in the outer part and extends further than the tidal radius as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m03 - 2 ] .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion has an exponential shape out to the tidal radius and rises beyond this point due to the surrounding unbound particles .    to follow the future evolution of less massive objects like",
    "this cluster one would definitely need a direct n - body code to account for internal evolution caused by two - body relaxation effects .",
    "nevertheless as shown in fig  [ fig : m03 - 1 ] ( right panel ) with our code which suppresses two - body relaxation completely the dissolution time is about @xmath58  gyr . comparing our result with simulations by @xcite ( their fig .",
    "3 ) our result is very similar to that obtained from their more appropriate simulation ( dissolution time @xmath76  gyr ) .",
    "in the isolated case our models are able to reproduce the standard value for the sfe to retain a bound object after gas - expulsion .",
    "the critical sfe beyond which a few per cent of bound stars are retained is @xmath0  per cent ( for gas - expulsion within a crossing - time ) .",
    "the sfe which leads to an object which one can call a star cluster is about @xmath14  per cent .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with previous theoretical works @xcite using collision - less methods and give us confidence in the correctness of our approach of treating gas expulsion .",
    "the use of collisional n - body codes reduces these values further and experiments @xcite show a remaining bound object of size and richness of the pleiades at a sfe of @xmath8  per cent for an initially embedded orion - nebula like cluster consisting of @xmath77 stars and brown dwarves .",
    "this work has shown that , for star clusters forming in star cluster complexes , there is no clear correlation between sfe and final mass of the object .",
    "this is due to the random realisations of the star clusters inside the cluster complex leading to different individual encounter and merger histories . as a general trend we can state that this environment is able to assemble a bound object at a much lower sfe than the isolated case would predict .",
    "we find a surviving bound object at a star formation efficiency as low as @xmath2  per cent",
    ". for low sfes the resulting bound mass of the remaining object is on average higher than the isolated case would predict .",
    "but if the sfe is very high the destructive forces of the encounters and merging become dominant and the resulting merger objects retain a significantly lower bound mass than in the isolated case .",
    "one reason for the ability of cluster complexes to reduce the necessary sfe for a bound object is the deeper potential well of the cluster complex which helps to retain some of the escaping stars .",
    "but another important reason is the merging of the star clusters .",
    "as already shown in previous studies @xcite the star clusters in dense cluster complexes merge on very short time - scales , namely a few crossing - times of the cluster complex , with a merger object visible already in the first one or two crossing times .",
    "if the complex is dense enough , i.e.  its crossing - time is short and of the order of the gas - expulsion time - scale , some clusters merge and form a larger , more massive object before stars react to the gas - loss and try to escape . within the more massive merger object",
    "they need a much higher escape velocity and more stars stay gravitationally bound and recollapse again to form a bound object .",
    "while such objects can be dense and massive enough to survive for a hubble time @xcite , they do not resemble normal globular clusters because they have rather large effective radii .",
    "they can only survive as noticeable objects in a weak tidal field and thus in the outskirts of galaxies , having been born for example in tidal tails of interacting gas - rich galaxies .",
    "while our study is based on dense star cluster complexes as found in the central region in the antennae @xcite , we also performed a simulation with a sfe of @xmath8  per cent and delayed gas - expulsion placing an extended cluster complex in the outer halo region . even though , due to the long crossing - time scales of this complex the star clusters rather disperse than merge , the environment ( i.e.  the deeper potential of the star cluster complex ) is able to help these dispersed star clusters to survive .",
    "they still resemble bound objects retaining almost a third of their initial mass in stars even after one gyr .",
    "we described the further evolution of one of our merger objects ( in the extreme case ) with a sfe of @xmath2  per cent in detail .",
    "the properties of this object ( low mass , large effective radius ) are similar to those found for the faint fuzzy star clusters in ngc  1023 @xcite .",
    "our objects also resemble the faint gcs in the outer mw halo @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time of such an object amounts to @xmath78  gyr .    in one of our simulations we found an escaping and surviving single star cluster at a sfe which should nt allow its survival .",
    "we argued that a close encounter with another star cluster which lead to an expulsion instead of a merger was able to shock the particle distribution such that the expanding and dissolution process was compensated leaving a low - mass but large , bound star cluster behind . even though an object that small would not survive for a hubble time due to internal two - body relaxation @xcite ( the relaxation time measured at @xmath71  gyr is @xmath79  gyr , and due to constant mass - loss is reduced to @xmath80  myr at @xmath81  gyr ) one might find young or even intermediate age objects close to star - burst regions which could look like our model .",
    "another observational counterpart regarding the physical properties might be the recently discovered @xcite unusual globular cluster sdssj1049 + 5103 .",
    "it has a half - light radius of @xmath82  pc and a mass in the range of a few hundred up to a thousand solar masses .",
    "the authors argue that this cluster is either in the final stage of dissolution , which would make it a perfect counterpart to our surviving star cluster ( seen at its final stage at @xmath81  gyr ) , or a very faint and low - mass dwarf spheroidal galaxy embedded in a dark matter halo .",
