    "only a much smaller hysteresis is observed .",
    "the hysteresis becomes narrower with increasing temperature and completely vanishes at 16  k ( fig .  [ g_hyst_t ] ) , which is the magnetic transition temperature common to both crystal directions . to follow the opening of the hysteresis , we plot in fig .",

    "mssbauer studies reveal a steep increase of this canting angle with increasing p substitution until the eu spins are aligned almost perpendicular to the @xmath5-plane.@xcite we want to emphasize that this has a huge impact on magnetic susceptibility and has to be considered in the interpretation .    due to the non - negligible tilt angle out of the @xmath5-plane , as displayed in fig .",

    "the small hysteresis visible for @xmath34 is likely caused by our limited precision in crystal alignment and we will not discuss it further .",
    "the fact that in the parent compound the hysteresis can not be resolved might be due to the extremely small spin canting . since chemical and physical pressures have a similar effect on the 122 compounds , we propose to examine eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals by a high - pressure squid susceptometer to confirm and complete the phase diagram .",

    "_ based on single crystal measurements@xcite with that of nowik _ et al . _ who performed measurements on polycrystalline samples.@xcite",
    "the former observe afm eu@xmath1 ordering in the superconducting phase , whereas the latter group claims the coexistence of fm and superconductivity .",

    "if they measure along the @xmath4-axis , they will also yield a phase diagram with the eu ordering along the @xmath4-axis ; for this direction superconductivity coexists with fm .",
    "we sketch such a phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasendiagrammneu ] , where we distinguish between the eu net magnetization along the @xmath12- and @xmath4-axis .",
    "this causes implications that are in particular interesting for theoretical considerations about the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity , as superconductivity in pnictides is often considered as quasi - two - dimensional .",
    "on the basis of in - plane magnetization measurements of eufe@xmath0(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath0 single crystals , jeevan _",
    "et al._@xcite proposed a phase diagram that includes fm eu@xmath1 ordering for high p content . assuming that the sample was perfectly oriented with @xmath30",
    ", this suggests the spin alignment displayed in fig .",
    "[ phasendiagrammneu ] for @xmath35 .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the hysteresis continues to open with increasing p substitution,@xcite while the canting angle already saturates at @xmath39.@xcite    there is still some discussion about the actual coupling mechanism between the eu layers .",
    "ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction might play an important role ( although it is not clear what happens in the superconducting state ) , but other mediation via the fe layers is also possible , since direct exchange and dipolar interaction can be ruled out . when going from eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 to euas@xmath0p@xmath0 the @xmath12 and @xmath4 axes decrease by 2.3% and 7.3% , respectively.@xcite the reduction of the unit - cell volume and the change of the fermi surface with pressure@xcite could turn an interlayer rkky coupling from afm to fm.@xcite    field - dependent magnetization measurements ranging up to several tesla can be also explained by the eu@xmath1 spin alignment displayed in fig .",
    "[ phasendiagrammneu ] and indicate fm interlayer coupling at higher pressure . in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0",
    "the magnetic behaviors for @xmath30 and @xmath28 differ significantly.@xcite while in both directions saturation is achieved around 1  t , a step - like magnetization curve appears only in the case of @xmath30 . at low field strength ,",
    "the eu@xmath1 spins start to realign , but keep their afm orientation in adjacent planes ; above a kind of spin - flip field the orientation of the spins parallel to the external field wins over the afm interlayer coupling . in the case of @xmath28 , however , we propose that such magnetization behavior does not appear since there is no afm ordering in the @xmath4-direction that has to be broken ( fig .",
    "[ phasendiagrammneu ] ) . according to our model ,",
    "the step - like behavior of the magnetization with @xmath30 should become weaker as the canting angle of the eu@xmath1 spins out of the @xmath5-plane grows with pressure . for larger canting angles ,",
    "it gets more and more energetically favorable to orient the spins directly parallel to the external field instead of keeping the afm ordering . in the case of the fm ordered phase ( fig .",
    "[ phasendiagrammneu ] , @xmath35 ) , the step - like behavior vanishes .",
    "actually , this magnetization dependence was observed for eufe@xmath40ni@xmath3as@xmath0 , with a weak step in the case of @xmath41 , which disappears for higher dopings.@xcite    pressure - dependent susceptibility measurements would help to identify the correlations between the eu@xmath1 ordering and other phase transitions .",
    "it is quite surprising that the tilting angle of the eu@xmath1 moments stays the same , when the sdw is completely suppressed ( fig .",
    "[ phasendiagrammneu]).@xcite this infers that the itinerant afm phase of the feas layers , with the magnetic moments being aligned within the @xmath5-plane,@xcite does influence the eu@xmath1 ordering .",
    "it is unlikely that the minor structural phase transition between the orthorhombic and tetragonal phase , taking place at approximately the same p content , has some influence on the canting angle .",
    "understanding the alignment of the eu@xmath1 magnetic moments will also reveal more information on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "one interesting feature appearing in the eu 122 pnictides is a resistivity re - entrance in the superconducting phase near the eu@xmath1 magnetic ordering temperature.@xcite in eu(fe@xmath13co@xmath14)@xmath0as@xmath0 the eu@xmath1 are ordered afm in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "the superconducting re - entrance can be suppressed with an external magnetic field in the @xmath5-plane , while a magnetic field @xmath28 has no influence on the re - entrance.@xcite we do not understand yet , why the afm eu@xmath1 ordering destroys the superconductivity , while it can coexist with the field - induced fm .",
    "nevertheless our model allows us to explain why a magnetic field applied along the @xmath4-direction has no appreciable influence : it only weakens the spin components in the @xmath5-plane without destroying the afm ordering itself .",
    "it should also be noted that for several eu 122 compounds , susceptibility measurements show additional features below the pronounced afm or fm eu ordering , which could have the same origin as the resistivity re - entrance.@xcite here we want to point out that ahmed _",
    "et al._@xcite observe a significant enhancement of the spin moment on the fe @xmath42 electrons in eufe@xmath0(as@xmath43p@xmath44)@xmath0 at @xmath45  k. together with the ordered eu@xmath1 moments , the internal magnetic field can then exceed the superconducting upper critical field leading to the re - entrance of resistivity .",
    "analyzing measurements of the magnetic properties of various eu 122 compounds we propose that the alignment of the localized eu@xmath1 magnetic moments in eufe@xmath0(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath0 changes with pressure . in the parent compound eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "the spins are not simply antiferromagnetically aligned in adjacent @xmath5-planes but canted by a few degrees , causing a small ferromagnetic component in @xmath4-direction . when the interlayer coupling changes with pressure , the canting increases until the sdw in the feas subsystem is suppressed and superconductivity sets in .",
    "there is a coexistence of superconductivity with antiferromagnetism along the @xmath12-direction and ferromagnetism along the @xmath4-axis . at even higher pressure , the interlayer coupling switches to a ferromagnetic one .",
