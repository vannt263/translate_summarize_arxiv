    "the model of * coined ( unitary ) quantum random walks * ( uqw ) has been widely studied in recent years and has found numerous applications in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "the associated discrete time map acting on the integers can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a linear unitary operator acting on the hilbert space given by the tensor product @xmath2 of the so - called coin space , @xmath3 , and the state space , @xmath4 .",
    "the unitary map @xmath5 is defined as the coin , and the map @xmath6 is the shift operator @xmath7 we consider @xmath8 and @xmath9 for 1-qubit walks on the integers .",
    "if we write @xmath10 ( so that @xmath5 is assumed unitary ) and @xmath11 is a state localized at @xmath12 , then a simple calculation shows that @xmath13 and the probabilities of finding the particle at site @xmath14 or @xmath15 after one step are , respectively , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "after two steps , @xmath18 and the probabilities of reaching sites @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath20 in two steps are given by @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the calculations work in a similar way for larger times .",
    "more recently , the model of * open quantum random walks * ( oqw ) has been proposed by attal et al .",
    "@xcite . let @xmath24 belong to @xmath25 , the order @xmath26 square complex matrices , such that for each @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the order @xmath26 identity matrix .",
    "we say that @xmath30 is the number of * sites * and @xmath26 is the * degree of freedom * on each site .",
    "define @xmath31 where @xmath32 means that @xmath33 is positive semidefinite . for a given initial density matrix of such form , the oqw on @xmath30 sites induced by the @xmath34",
    ", @xmath35 is , by definition @xcite , the quantum channel @xmath36 we say that @xmath34 is the effect matrix of transition from site @xmath37 to site @xmath38 .",
    "the case of homogeneous nearest neighbor oqws on @xmath39 can be written , for matrices satisfying @xmath40 , in the form @xmath41 in a similar way as in closed walks , we have a statistical interpretation of the traces of the matrices associated to each site . as an example , for the nearest neighbor walk above , if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 and the probability of reaching sites @xmath14 or @xmath15 after one step are respectively @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in two steps ,",
    "we get @xmath46 and the probabilities of reaching sites @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath20 in two steps , are given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the calculations work in a similar way for larger times .",
    "this is one of the simplest examples of oqws .",
    "it is worth noting that if we have a density of the form ( [ dens_attal ] ) then @xmath50 for some @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the projections @xmath52 do not get mixed , so the channel describing the walk , when restricted to densities of such form , can be seen as acting on a direct sum space .    since the publication of @xcite , several works have appeared describing some of the statistical properties of oqws .",
    "we mention some of the topics studied so far :    1 .",
    "central limit theorems for oqws @xcite .",
    "reducibility , periodicity , ergodic properties of oqws @xcite .",
    "3 .   large deviations for oqws @xcite .",
    "microscopic derivation of open quantum brownian motion @xcite .",
    "criteria for site recurrence of oqws on @xmath39 @xcite . 6 .",
    "hitting times for oqws @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a more complete list of publications . in this work",
    "we are interested in further studying item 5 above , namely , recurrence properties of oqws and we proceed with this goal having in mind some related properties of uqws .",
    "one of the notions of recurrence for iterative unitary dynamics that we consider here has been defined by grnbaum et al . @xcite .",
    "the other one , which is also discussed here in the context of oqws , has been presented by tefak et al . @xcite .",
    "the notion of monitored recurrence for oqws studied in this work has been first described in @xcite and is closely motivated by the unitary notion as in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the dynamics of oqws are in general quite different from the coined uqws .",
    "the main reason for this is simple and is highlighted by the following observations :    1 .   in the context of oqws , we are interested in * iterative quantum trajectories*. by this we mean that we prepare an initial density matrix , apply the channel on it and then perform a measurement to determine the site for which the system has evolved to . then by normalizing we obtain a new density and we repeat the process .",
    "so , at each step we have a probability computation and this procedure is thus identified with * summing the squares of amplitudes*. this typically produces gaussian curves or linear combinations of these as probability distributions @xcite .",
    "see figure 1 , left .",
    "2 .   in the context of coined unitary quantum random walks",
    ", it is well known that the probability distribution is a very particular one and this happens due to interference : we let the system evolve and at the @xmath53-th step we perform a measurement .",
    "in other words , we * sum amplitudes and then take the square modulus*. the typical outcome is the konno distribution @xcite .",
    "see figure 1 , right .        in this work , and with these observations in mind",
    ", we address the following problems :      what are the conditions on @xmath54 and @xmath55 so that the homogeneous nearest neighbor oqw on @xmath39 is site recurrent ? a notion of recurrence for oqws has been defined in @xcite :    * definition .",
    "* let @xmath56 be an oqw .",
    "we say that a * site * @xmath57 is * recurrent * with respect to @xmath56 if for every density matrix @xmath33 the following holds : beginning at @xmath58 , the probability of ever returning to site @xmath57 equals 1 . in the notation of hitting times ,",
    "let @xmath59 be the set of all products of @xmath60 matrices corresponding to a sequence of vertices that a walk is allowed to perform with @xmath56 , starting at @xmath57 and first reaching @xmath61 in the @xmath60-th step .",
    "note that @xmath62 if @xmath63 ( see [ @xcite , section 5 ] for examples )",
    ". then site @xmath57 is recurrent for @xmath56 if , for every density matrix @xmath33 , @xmath64 we say that @xmath56 is * site recurrent * if every site is recurrent .",
    "this is a natural notion of site recurrence of quantum trajectories produced by an oqw @xcite .",
    "we will sometimes refer to this notion as * monitored * recurrence ( see below the corresponding notion for unitary maps )",
    ".    * remark .",
    "* we emphasize that in the notions of recurrence studied in this work we are only interested in the return to the initial site , regardless of the associated density obtained at the moment of return ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "then we check if this return probability equals 1 for every given @xmath65 .",
    "this is not the only possible definition , and we refer the reader to @xcite for more on this matter .    in @xcite , a criterion for recurrence of oqws is proved for certain walks on @xmath39 .",
    "we restate such result :    @xcite[teo2014 ] let @xmath54 , @xmath55 be order 2 pq - matrices inducing a homogeneous nearest neighbor unital oqw @xmath56 on @xmath39 .",
    "then , the associated walk is recurrent if and only if the eigenvalues of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are equal to @xmath68 .",
    "we recall that in dimension 2 , the pq - matrices are just the diagonal or antidiagonal matrices @xcite . in the original work ,",
    "the theorem was stated in terms of the square moduli of the nonzero entries of the pq matrices , but in dimension 2 , these are equal to the eigenvalues of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in this work",
    "we prove :    [ rectheo ] consider a nearest neighbor oqw on @xmath39 induced by matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "if the eigenvalues of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are equal to @xmath68 , then the walk is recurrent .",
    "moreover , the converse holds if the matrices are normal .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that the converse of this theorem without the normality assumption may be false , namely , the oqw induced by the rows of the hadamard matrix , @xmath69 produces a recurrent walk whose eigenvalues are equal to @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see example [ bas_oqw_hadrec ] ) .",
    "it is clear that there are cases in theorem [ teo2014 ] which are not covered by theorem [ rectheo ] and conversely .",
    "also in section [ secanotherex ] , we make a separate discussion for an example which does not meet the hypothesis of the above results .",
    "we also remark that in the converse of the above theorem , the assumption that both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are normal implies unitality and the proof also holds if we assume unitality and that one of the matrices is normal .",
    "the proof of theorem [ rectheo ] is presented in section [ secproofmain ] .    regarding the oqw setting we recall that we have a markov chain @xmath72 with values in @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the set of density matrices on @xmath75 hilbert space , and @xmath76 accounts for the set of vertices of the graph .",
    "then , from any position @xmath77 , one can jump to one of the other values given by @xmath78 with probability @xmath79 then one might ask why we should look for recurrence criteria when a well established description already exists in the theory of markov chains @xcite . the answer to this",
    "is that besides being interested in recurrence criteria which are based essentially on the entries of the matrices , we remark that if we are given a pair @xmath80 ( density in a given position ) , then as previously discussed , we are less interested in _ state _ recurrence than _ site _ recurrence .",
    "this corresponds to calculate the hitting probability of a collection of states .",
    "state recurrence still makes sense , but it is not the focus of this work .",
    "another point that should be emphasized , which is discussed in @xcite , is the fact that recurrence may depend on the initial state .",
    "then we have a trichotomy :    1 .",
    "a site of an oqw may be recurrent for every initial density matrix .",
    "example : hadamard oqw , and this is proved in example [ bas_oqw_hadrec ] .",
    "a site of an oqw may be recurrent for some , but not all densities .",
    "example : a diagonal oqw such as the one induced by @xmath81 , @xmath82 . to see this ,",
    "consider the densities given by the matrix units @xmath83 ( results in recurrence ) and @xmath84 ( transience ) .",
    "3 .   a site of an oqw may be transient , i.e. , it is not recurrent for any density .",
    "example : once again a suitable diagonal choice suffices .",
    "another example is the oqw induced by the amplitude damping channel , @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "we recall that in grnbaum et al .",
    "@xcite , the authors discuss notions of state and site recurrence of iterative unitary evolutions in terms of * monitoring*. mathematically , _ monitoring _",
    "a system is different from _ measuring _ a system : if @xmath1 is a unitary map and @xmath86 is a initial state , we may inspect the recurrence of @xmath86 in the @xmath53-th step .",
    "this is made by iterating @xmath1 once and then projecting onto the complement of the space generated by @xmath86 ( the monitoring procedure ) .",
    "we repeat this procedure and at the @xmath53-th step we iterate one more step , project onto @xmath86 and then perform a measurement ( i.e. , take the square modulus of the amplitude function ) . following @xcite ,",
    "write @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the orthogonal projection onto some subspace @xmath89 of @xmath75 . for @xmath90",
    ", we say that @xmath91 is the * @xmath89-return probability * of @xmath92 .",
    "* definition . *",
    "let @xmath1 be a unitary map on a hilbert space @xmath75 , @xmath89 a subspace of @xmath75 and @xmath93 a unit vector .",
    "we say that the state @xmath86 is * @xmath89-recurrent * if @xmath94 ; that is , @xmath86 is recaptured by @xmath89 with probability 1 .",
    "we say that a subspace @xmath89 is * recurrent * if every state @xmath86 in @xmath89 is @xmath89-recurrent . as in the oqw case , this is also called * monitored * state / subspace recurrence",
    ".    then we see that * site recurrence * can also be described in this notation : given a state @xmath95 on site @xmath96 , we would like to know whether it is recaptured by ( the space generated by ) site @xmath96 with probability 1 , that is , whether it is @xmath97-recurrent , where @xmath98    we also recall that in @xcite a different notion of recurrence of unitary systems is presented . in this work ,",
    "we review such notion ( also revisited in @xcite ) and later we show that it can also be used in open systems",
    ". let @xmath99 denote the probability of reaching site @xmath12 given that the walk started at @xmath100 and let @xmath101\\ ] ] denote the probability of not finding the particle at the origin in the first @xmath30 trials .",
    "we define @xmath102\\ ] ] in an analogous way .",
    "then @xmath103 is the probability of finding the particle at least once at the origin in the first @xmath30 trials . the number @xmath104 is defined accordingly , and it is called the * plya number * of the uqw .",

    "the term above is named after the authors @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown an example where , for iterative unitary evolutions , sjk - recurrence is not equivalent to monitored recurrence .",
    "how about this notion for oqws ?",
    "in section [ secpolyapatheq ] , noting that an analogous definition of plya numbers for oqws is given , we prove the following :    for an oqw , we have the following : a ) if for each @xmath65 , @xmath77 is monitored - recurrent then for each @xmath65 , @xmath77 is sjk - recurrent .",
    "b ) if a site is sjk - recurrent for a given oqw with respect to some state @xmath77 then @xmath57 is monitored - recurrent with respect to some state @xmath108 which is accessible from @xmath77 .    above , to say that a state @xmath109 is * accessible * from @xmath65",
    "means that there is a path on the graph , described by a product of transition matrices of the oqw , e.g. @xmath110 , such that @xmath111 .",
    "we also note that even though the converse b ) above is apparently weaker than the direct implication , we will see that in many cases this is enough to prove monitored - recurrence of the walk ( see the end of section [ secpolyapatheq ] and section [ secanotherex ] ) .",
    "first we note that any two matrices @xmath54 , @xmath55 of the form @xmath112 such that a ) @xmath113 is unitary and b ) @xmath40 , induce both a unitary and an open quantum walk on @xmath39 given by ( [ canonicuqw ] ) and ( [ oqrwbasexp ] ) , respectively .",
    "whenever both a uqw and an oqw are considered , we assume in this work that this is the decomposition being used .",
    "one basic example is given by walk induced by the rows of the hadamard matrix [ splithad ] and we call the associated walks the * unitary * ( resp . open ) * hadamard walk*. in section [ secinterf ] we show that the information of recurrence of the oqw and uqw induced by a pair of matrices is connected by an interference term :    if @xmath114 and @xmath115 denotes , respectively , the monitored recurrence probability for the uqw and oqw induced by a pair of matrices , both with respect to a given initial state @xmath86 , then @xmath116 where @xmath117 is an interference term .    the following result is a simple consequence :    [ interf_coro ] let @xmath54 , @xmath55 be two matrices satisfying @xmath40 and such that @xmath113 is unitary .",
    "suppose that @xmath118 ( the so - called negative interference assumption ) .",

    "if site @xmath96 is recurrent for the uqw , then it is recurrent for the oqw with respect to any pure density @xmath123 .",
    "following @xcite , we can also present a simple relation between oqws on the line and the schur function of the associated qrw ( see example [ plancherelex ] ) .    at this point",
    "at least one important remark is in order , namely , the negative interference assumption @xmath118 is certainly not always valid .",
    "moreover , the problem of being able to control or estimate such function is a nontrivial one .",
    "can one obtain natural , concrete examples , for which such assumption is true ?",
    "we show in this work that the unitary coined hadamard walk on @xmath39 in fact satisfies such assumption , thus producing an interesting relation between the open and closed walks induced by the hadamard matrix .    in the appendix , as a complement to a result on positive recurrence studied in @xcite , we prove the following .",

    "* remark . * with the exception of the appendix , we note that all examples considered in this work concern homogeneous nearest neighbor walks on @xmath39",
    ". however , many of the facts presented still hold if we consider general graphs , or different coins on different sites , with analogous proofs .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion on the decomposition of order @xmath53 unitary matrices into a sum of row matrices and its properties ( the expression ( [ gooddecomp ] ) being the case @xmath129 ) .",
    "oqws are particular examples of completely positive maps and we refer the reader to @xcite for basic definitions .",
    "we recall that completely positive maps can be written in the kraus form @xcite , namely , there exist certain matrices @xmath130 such that @xmath131 we say that @xmath56 is * trace - preserving * if @xmath132 for all @xmath133 , a condition which is equivalent to @xmath134 .",
    "we say that @xmath56 is * unital * if @xmath135 , which is equivalent to @xmath136 .",
    "trace - preserving completely positive ( cpt ) maps are also called * quantum channels*. also recall that if @xmath137 there is the corresponding vector representation @xmath138 associated to it , given by stacking together the matrix rows .",

    "it should be clear that the spectrum of the channel is given by the corresponding information extracted from @xmath146 $ ] and this will be useful later in this work .",
    "we recall the well - known fact that the matrix representation of a cpt map @xmath148 is independent of the kraus representation considered .",
    "the proof of this result is a simple consequence of the unitary equivalence of kraus matrices for a given quantum channel @xcite .",
    "first note that for any vectors @xmath149 and @xmath150 , @xmath151 ( see @xcite ex .",
    "28 , p. 253 ) , which implies @xmath152 and @xmath153 suppose that we wish to determine the recurrence of a uqw walk on @xmath39 with initial state @xmath11 .",
    "recall from the introduction that @xmath154 is the collection of all paths allowed by the matrices of the oqw , starting at @xmath57 and first returning to @xmath57 in the @xmath60-th step .",

    "then we conclude : the recurrence probability of the unitary walk equals the recurrence probability of the open walk plus an interference term .",
    "this interference may lead to recurrence of the unitary walk which is larger or smaller than its open counterpart .",
    "if we let @xmath114 denote the recurrence probability for the uqw and if @xmath159 denotes the recurrence probability for the oqw , then by defining @xmath160 , we get @xmath161 as a conclusion , if we understand the behavior of @xmath162 then we are able to conclude certain facts :    1 .",
    "first , note that @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , if an oqw is recurrent we have @xmath164 and so by the above equation we must have @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath165 , then the uqw is also recurrent , else it must be transient .",
    "2 .   consider the particular case with a negative interference , @xmath166 then , @xmath167 as the expression on the rhs of this inequality corresponds to the probability of return of quantum trajectories beginning at site @xmath12 with initial density @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the validity of inequality ( [ special_cond ] ) allows us to conclude : recurrence of the monitored unitary system starting at @xmath100 implies recurrence of the quantum trajectory of the associated open walk starting at the pure state @xmath169 .",
    "conversely , under the assumption ( [ special_cond ] ) , if we know that a certain oqw is not recurrent with respect a certain pure density then we also know that the corresponding uqw is not recurrent for any state corresponding to that density .",
    "we register these facts in corollary [ interf_coro ] , presented in the introduction .",
    "[ plancherelex]*plancherel theorem and oqws . * in @xcite ,",
    "the authors describe a relation between schur functions and the problem of recurrence of iterative unitary evolutions on hilbert space .",
    "the schur function @xmath170 is also closely related to the stieltjes moment generating function and we can write @xmath171 following the mentioned authors , fix @xmath172 , consider the series @xmath173 as a fourier series and then obtain from the plancherel theorem , @xmath174 where @xmath175 represents the amplitude associated to a monitored first return to the origin at step @xmath53 . taking the limit @xmath176",
    ", we obtain @xmath177 and by the identity @xmath178 , we have @xmath179 so we see that recurrence of the oqw is dependent on the interference pattern produced by the uqw and its associated schur function @xmath170 .",
    "so , in principle , the fact that @xmath170 is inner may not be enough to ensure ( or forbid ) recurrence of the associated oqw .",
    "on the other hand , by [ @xcite , theorem 1 ] , if @xmath180 then the spectral measure @xmath181 for the uqw has an absolutely continuous part and so the unitary walk is not recurrent with respect to @xmath86 .",
    "once again , it is essential to have some knowledge on the behavior of the interference pattern .",
    "here we illustrate some of the differences between the uqw and the oqw on @xmath39 , both induced by the hadamard coin via ( [ canonicuqw ] ) and ( [ oqrwbasexp ] ) , respectively .",

    "then , by routine calculations , we can obtain probabilities of reaching a particular site , given an initial state .",
    "for instance , @xmath185 @xmath186 which implies the probabilities ( with the initial @xmath86 above ) @xmath187 in the case of oqws , we have to consider quantum trajectories and , as such , we have to perform measurements at each step so the calculations produce probabilities which are different from the unitary case . in other words , instead of taking the square modulus of a sum of amplitudes , we are summing probabilities , as discussed in the introduction . if @xmath188 denotes the position of the particle under the action of the oqw at time @xmath53 with the initial @xmath86 fixed above then , for @xmath168 , @xmath189 @xmath190 @xmath191 as expected , the probabilities for the oqw and uqw on time @xmath192 are distinct , and for larger times the uqw produces the well - known konno distribution , whereas the oqw produces a gaussian distribution .",
