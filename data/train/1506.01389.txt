    "of course , the probability of collision of @xmath0 alternating kinks and antikinks decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath0 ( and even then , the probability of their concurrent collision is very low ) , but such rare events can have important consequences , when they do arise .    as for the open problems ,",
    "it is important to calculate the maximal energy density that can be achieved in multi - soliton collisions in other integrable and non - integrable systems of different dimensionality .",
    "for example , one can examine similar issues and design such collisions in other klein - gordon field theoretic models ( e.g. in the @xmath161 or @xmath162 models  @xcite ) , as well as in the one - dimensional , self - defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation",

    "it would also be particularly interesting to explore to attempt to prove the asymptotic statements inferred herein ; although perhaps a direct approach towards this starting from a multi - soliton solution could be very cumbersome , perhaps a reverse approach , initializing the system with a suitably large , and highly localized energy density at a point and utilizing the inverse scattering transform to establish that this waveform will split into @xmath0 soliton solutions may be more tractable .",

    "<S> solitons are very effective in transporting energy over great distances and collisions between them can produce high energy density spots of relevance to phase transformations , energy localization and defect formation among others . </S>",
    "<S> it is then important to study how energy density accumulation scales in multi - soliton collisions . in this study , we demonstrate that the maximal energy density that can be achieved in collision of @xmath0 slowly moving kinks and antikinks in the integrable sine - gordon field , remarkably , is proportional to @xmath1 , while the total energy of the system is proportional to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this maximal energy density can be achieved only if the difference between the number of colliding kinks and antikinks is minimal , i.e. , is equal to 0 for even @xmath0 and 1 for odd @xmath0 and if the pattern involves an alternating array of kinks and anti - kinks . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for odd ( even ) @xmath0 the maximal energy density appears in the form of potential ( kinetic ) energy , while kinetic ( potential ) energy is equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the present study rely on the analysis of the exact multi - soliton solutions for @xmath2 and 3 and on the numerical simulation results for @xmath3 and 7 . based on these results </S>",
    "<S> one can speculate that the soliton collisions in the sine - gordon field can , in principle , controllably produce very high energy density . </S>",
    "<S> this can have important consequences for many physical phenomena described by the klein - gordon equations . </S>"
