    "it has been shown that the nonextensive generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs thermostatistics , proposed by tsallis , can be very relevant in many physical applications where long - range interactions , long - range microscopic memories and/or fractal space - time constraints are present @xcite .",
    "in particular , recently , many authors outline the possible connection to the nonextensive statistical framework with nuclear and high energy physical applications @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to generalize the basic concepts of the nonextensive statistical mechanics to the relativistic regime and to investigate , through the obtained relativistic thermodynamic relations , the relevance of nonextensive statistical effects on the hadronic and on the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) equation of state ( eos ) . as we will see , small deviations from the extensive thermostatistics produce a significant modification into the shape of the hadronic and qgp equation of state with important consequence on the deconfined phase transition and on several nuclear properties .",
    "in this section we present the basic macroscopic thermodynamics variables in the language of the nonextensive relativistic kinetic theory .",
    "let us start by introducing the particle four - flow in the phase space as @xcite @xmath0 and the energy - momentum flow as @xmath1 where we have set @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the relativistic energy and @xmath6 is the particle distribution function .",
    "the four - vector @xmath7 contains the probability density @xmath8 ( which is normalized to unity ) and the probability flow @xmath9 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor contains the normalized @xmath10-mean expectation value of the energy density , as well as the energy flow , the momentum and the momentum flow per particle .",
    "its expression follows directly from the definition of the mean @xmath10-expectation value in nonextensive statistics @xcite ; for this reason it is given in terms of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , in the framework of the nonextensive thermostatistics , it appears natural to generalize the nonextensive four - flow entropy @xmath12 as follows @xmath13 \\ ; . \\label{entro4}\\ ] ]    it is possible to show @xcite that such an entropy , together a generalized relativistic boltzmann equation , satisfies the relativistic local @xmath14-theorem and implies the following tsallis - like equilibrium probability distribution @xmath15^{1/(1-q ) } \\ ; , \\label{nrdistri}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the hydrodynamic four - velocity @xcite and @xmath17 depends only on the momentum in absence of an external field . at this stage",
    ", @xmath18 is a free parameter and only in the derivation of the equation of state it will be identified with the physical temperature .",
    "we are able now to evaluate explicitly all other thermodynamic variables and provide a complete macroscopic description of a relativistic system at the equilibrium .",
    "let us first calculate the probability density defined as @xmath19 since @xmath20 is a scalar , it can be evaluated in the rest frame where @xmath21 .",
    "setting @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the above integral can be written as @xmath24 let us introduce the @xmath10-modified bessel function of the second kind as follows @xmath25 then , by means of a partial integration of eq.([densrel ] ) , the particle density can be cast into the compact form @xmath26    considering the decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy density , @xmath29 the pressure and @xmath30 , the equilibrium pressure can be calculated as @xmath31 and can be expressed as @xmath32 comparing eq.([densi ] ) with eq.([press ] ) , we obtain @xmath33 which is the equation of state of a perfect gas if we identify @xmath34 as the physical temperature of the system .",
    "we proceed now to calculate the energy density @xmath28 as @xmath35 inserting the previously defined variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 and using the definition in eq.([qbessel ] ) , we obtain @xmath38 \\ ; .\\ ] ] thus the energy per particle @xmath39 is @xmath40 which has the same structure of the relativistic expression obtained in the framework of the equilibrium boltzmann - gibbs statistics @xcite .    for a system of particles in degenerate regime",
    "the above classical distribution function ( [ nrdistri ] ) has to be modified by including the fermion and boson quantum statistical prescriptions . for a dilute gas of particles and/or for small deviations from the standard extensive statistics ( @xmath41 ) the equilibrium distribution function , in the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath42^{1/(q-1 ) } \\pm 1 }   \\ , , \\label{distrifd}\\ ] ] where the sign @xmath43 stands for fermion and @xmath44 for boson particle .",
    "all the previous results can be easily extended to the case of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "the motivation of the importance of non - standard statistical effects in nuclear and high energy physics lies in the fact the extreme conditions of density and temperature in high energy nuclear collisions give rise to memory effects and long  range color interactions .",
    "these conditions imply the presence of non ",
    "markovian processes in the kinetic equation affecting the thermalization process toward equilibrium as well as the standard equilibrium distribution @xcite . a rigorous determination of the conditions that produce a nonextensive behavior , due to memory effects and/or long  range interactions , should be based on microscopic calculations relative to the parton plasma originated during the high energy collisions . at this stage",
    "we limit ourselves to consider the problem from a qualitative point of view .",
    "however , it is noteworthy to notice that in proximity of the hadronic - qgp phase transition , non  perturbative qcd calculations become important .",
    "only a small number of partons is present in the debye sphere : the ordinary mean field approximation of the plasma is no longer correct and memory effects are not negligible . in addition , we observe that at high density the color magnetic field remains unscreened ( in leading order ) and long  range color magnetic interaction should be present at all temperatures .    from the above considerations it appears reasonable that in regime of high density and temperature both hadronic and quark - gluon eoss must be affected by nonextensive statistical effects .",
    "in the next two subsections , we will study the two eoss separately on the basis on the previously obtained relativistic thermodynamic relations .      concerning the hadronic phase we use a relativistic non - linear model based on the interacting many - particle system consisting of nucleons , isoscalar and isovector mesons ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47)@xcite .",
    "on the basis of the eqs.([tmunu ] ) , ( [ pressrel ] ) and ( [ energyrel ] ) , the pressure and the energy density can be written as @xmath48 -\\frac{1}{2}m_\\sigma^2\\phi^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;-",
