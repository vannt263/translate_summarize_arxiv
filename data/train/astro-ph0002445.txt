    "damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems detected in spectra of high - redshift quasars are believed to be the progenitors of present - day galaxies , because they show high h  i column densities ( log @xmath17 ) and display absorption lines of several heavy elements .",
    "however , there are various competing ideas regarding the nature of the galaxies underlying the dlas .",
    "wolfe et al . ( 1986 ) suggested that the dlas are rotating proto - disks .",
    "this suggestion has also been made by prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 , 1998 ) , based on asymmetric line profiles of the heavy - element absorption lines in dlas .",
    "on the other hand , gas - rich dwarf galaxies have also been suggested as candidate objects for the dlas ( york et al .",
    "1986 ; matteucci , molaro , & vladilo 1997 ) .",
    "recently , jimenez , bowen , & matteucci ( 1999 ) have suggested that high - redshift dlas may arise in low - surface brightness galaxies . the lack of substantial chemical evolution found in studies of element abundances in dlas ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "1999 ; kulkarni , bechtold , & ge 2000a ) also shows that the currently known population of dlas seems to be dominated by metal - poor objects , so dlas may consist of dwarf or low - surface brightness galaxies with modest star formation rates .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to determine what type of galaxies underlie the dlas , since most previous efforts to directly image the high - redshift dlas have failed .",
    "a few detections have been made at low redshifts , which showed those dlas to arise in low surface - brightness galaxies ( see , e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1995a , 1995b ; lebrun et al .",
    "but high - redshift dlas with @xmath18 have proven hard to detect , and the question of the nature of galaxies giving rise to these dlas is still open .",
    "many of the previous attempts to detect the emission from dlas concentrated on the ly-@xmath0 emission , which is an expected signature from a star - forming region ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "1989 ; hunstead , pettini , & fletcher 1990 ; lowenthal et al .",
    "there have been only a few ly-@xmath0 detections of dlas so far .",
    "mller & warren ( 1998 ) and mller , warren , & fynbo ( 1998 ) detected ly-@xmath0 emission in the fields of two dlas at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , both of these dlas have @xmath21 and may be different from the general population of intervening dlas .",
    "djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and djorgovski ( 1997 ) reported ly-@xmath0 emitting objects with @xmath22 ( and inferred sfrs of a few m@xmath11 yr@xmath15 ) in fields of a few dlas , located at 2 - 3 @xmath3 from the quasar .",
    "however , the ly-@xmath0 technique can not definitively measure the star formation rates of the dlas because of the generally unquantifiable effects of dust extinction in the systems .",
    "the lack of detections in the other ly-@xmath0 studies of interevening dlas could indicate either that dlas have low star formation rates ( sfr ) or that the emission is extinguished by dust . as pointed out by charlot & fall ( 1991 ) , even small quantities of dust are sufficient to extinguish the ly-@xmath0 emission , since resonant scattering greatly increases the path length of ly-@xmath0 photons attempting to escape from an h i cloud .",
    "indeed , observations of reddening of background quasars and evidence for depletion of cr , fe , ni etc .",
    "relative to zn suggest the presence of a small amount of dust in dlas ( see , e.g. , pei , fall , & bechtold 1991 ; pettini et al .",
    "1997 ; kulkarni , fall , & truran 1997 ) .",
    "thus , it is hard to constrain the sfrs in dla galaxies using the non - detections or weak detections of ly-@xmath0 emission .",
    "the issues of dust and sfr in high redshift dlas are also important in view of recent claims based on mid - ir and far - ir observations that a large fraction of the star formation at high redshifts is hidden from us by dust obscuration ( e.g. , elbaz et al . 1998 ; clements et al .",
    "1999 ) . one way to discern whether the previous non - detections of ly-@xmath0 were due to low sfr or presence of dust is to search for longer wavelength emission lines less affected by dust extinction and not subject to resonant scattering .",
    "the ground - based near - ir spectroscopic survey of bunker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which searched for redshifted h-@xmath0 emission in @xmath23 regions around 6 quasars with dlas at @xmath24 and reached 3 @xmath14 detection levels of 6 - 18 m@xmath11 yr@xmath15 , failed to detect any redshifted h-@xmath0 emission from the dlas in their sample . some of the ground - based narrow - band photometric surveys for h-@xmath0 emission from dlas have also failed to detect any emission line objects in the dla fields ( e.g. , teplitz , malkan , & mclean 1998 , who however found h-@xmath0 emitters in the fields of some weaker non - dla metal line systems ) .",
    "some other narrow - band searches for h-@xmath0 emission have revealed multiple objects in the dla fields separated by several arcseconds from the quasar ( 2 - 12@xmath3 for bechtold et al .",
    "1998 , 9 - 120 @xmath3 for mannucci et al .",
    "these surveys , which had 3 @xmath14 detection limits of @xmath25 m@xmath11 yr@xmath15 ( bechtold et al .",
    "1998 ) or @xmath26 m@xmath11 yr@xmath15 ( mannucci et al . 1998 ) , found the h-@xmath0 emitting objects to have a wide range of inferred sfrs ( 10 - 20 m@xmath11 yr@xmath15 for bechtold et al .",
    "1998 , 6 - 90 m@xmath11 yr@xmath15 for mannucci et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the relatively large separations of these emission line objects from the quasars indicates that they are not the dla absorbers themselves , but star - forming companions in the same larger structure ( e.g. sheet or filament ) as the dla .",
    "none of these ground - based surveys has been able to probe the regions very close to the quasar sightline ( angular separations @xmath27 @xmath3 ) , because of the limitations imposed by seeing in these studies .",
    "while these studies offer interesting information about the environments of the dlas , high sensitivity diffraction - limited imaging is necessary for the detection of the dla absorbers themselves ( to probe small angular separations ) , and thus for determining the morphology and sfrs of the dlas .",
    "the hst wfpc2 study of le brun et al .",
    "( 1997 ) has detected candidates with angular separations @xmath27 @xmath3 in broad band images for six dlas at @xmath28 and one dla at @xmath29 .",
    "however , the information obtained from this study about the nature of high - redshift dlas is limited since no narrow - band images were obtained and since the sample contained only 1 dla at @xmath30 . as mentioned earlier , the hst wfpc2 study of mller & warren ( 1998 and references therein ) detected ly-@xmath0 emission in a @xmath31 dla , but this dla may differ from intervening dlas .    to summarize , many previous attempts to detect emission from high - redshift",
    "intervening dlas have failed .",
    "the few detections so far consist mainly of either weak ly-@xmath0 detections ( which can not constrain the sfr completely ) or detections of h-@xmath0 companions at fairly large angular separations from the quasars .",
    "there are only four objects detected so far in fields of high-@xmath32 interevening dlas at small angular separations .",
    "these objects have impact parameters between 4.3 and 11.5 h@xmath33 kpc ( where @xmath34 h@xmath35 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ) , and are promising candidates for the dlas in those sightlines ( see mller & warren 1998 and references therein ; the other dla impact parameter data listed in mller & warren 1998 are biased toward @xmath21 dlas . ) .",
    "to further increase the number of promising candidates for high - redshift intervening dlas , it is necessary to carry out more deep high spatial resolution near - infrared searches for dlas .",
    "we have obtained deep diffraction - limited images of three dlas at @xmath36 with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . here",
    "we describe our nicmos observations of the quasar lbqs 1210 + 1731 ( @xmath37 ; hewett , foltz , & chaffee 1995 ) , which has a spectroscopically known damped ly-@xmath0 absorber ( @xmath38 and log @xmath39 ; wolfe et al .",
    "our observations have the unique benefit of combining high near - ir sensitivity and high spatial resolution with a more stable and quantifiable psf than is currently possible with ground - based observations .",
    "a further feature of some of our observations is the use of the nicmos coronagraph , which greatly decreases the scattered light background outside of the coronagraphic hole and therefore allows a study of the environment of the dla .",
    "our analysis indicates two objects at 0.25 @xmath3 and 0.7 @xmath3 from the quasar that we can not explain as any known artifacts of the psf .",
    "we believe that these objects are likely to be real and may be associated with the dla and its companions , at impact parameters of 1.5 and 3.8 h@xmath33 kpc .",
    "we have thus probed regions far closer to the quasar sight - line than in most previous studies of high - redshift intervening dlas , and the two objects we report mark the closest detected high - redshift intervening dla candidates yet to any quasar sight line .",
    "sections 2 , 3 , and 4 describe the observations , data reduction , and the subtraction of the quasar point spread functions .",
    "our results are described in section 5 .",
    "section 6 describes various tests of our data analysis procedures , carried out to investigate whether the features seen after psf subtraction are real .",
    "a summary of the results of the various data analysis tests is given in subsection 6.12 .",
    "( readers interested mainly in the scientific discussion can go directly from section 5 to subsection 6.12 . ) finally , sections 7 and 8 discuss the implications of our observations for sizes , environment , and star - formation rates of dla galaxies .",
    "the field of lbqs 1210 + 1731 was first observed on 1998 , july 22 from 07:14 ut to 16:40 ut , using nicmos camera 2 ( pixel scale @xmath40 , field of view @xmath41 ) .",
    "a sequence of spatially offset broad - band images was obtained in multiaccum mode with the f160w ( h ) filter ( central wavelength 1.5940 @xmath7 m , fwhm 0.4030 @xmath7 m ) .",
    "field offsetting was accomplished with a 5-point spiral dither pattern in steps of @xmath42 pixels , using the field offset mirror ( fom ) internal to nicmos .",
    "the exposures at each dwell point were 512 s long , giving a total integration time of 2560 s. see mackenty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a detailed description of nicmos imaging modes and options .",
    "the multiaccum observations consisted of non - destructive readouts in the `` step32 '' readout timing sequence , i.e. `` multiaccum '' readouts separated logarithmically up to 32 s and linearly in steps of 32 s beyond that . in addition , narrow - band images were obtained in the filter f190n ( central wavelength 1.9005 @xmath7 m , fwhm 0.0174 @xmath7 m ) , in which the redshifted h-@xmath0 emission from the dla , if present , would lie .",
    "four - point spiral dither patterns in steps of 7.5 pixels , with a 704 s `` step64 '' multiaccum exposure at each dwell point , were repeated in five successive orbits , resulting in a total integration time of 14,080 s. the spatial resolution of the f160w and f190n images is 0.14 @xmath3 ( 1.8 pixels ) and 0.17 @xmath3 ( 2.1 pixels ) fwhm , respectively .",
    "thus , camera 2 is almost critically sampled at the wavelengths used for our observations .",
    "finally , broad - band images in the f160w filter were also obtained using the camera 2 coronagraph on 1998 , july 29 from 10:14 to 13:07 ut .",
    "these consisted of an initial pair of 92 s long target - acquisition images , which were followed by placement of the target in the coronagraphic hole ( 0.3 @xmath3 or 4 pixels in geometrical radius ) and then integration of the object for a total of 4960 s ( 5 exposures of 480 s each in the first orbit and 5 exposures of 512 s each in the second orbit , all using the step32 multiaccum timing sequence ) .",
    "no dithering was used , of course , for the coronagraphic observations .",
    "the nicmos coronagraph is comprised of two optical elements , a 165 @xmath7 m physical diameter hole in the camera 2 field divider mirror at the reimaged hst f/24 optical telescope assembly ( ota ) focus and a lyot stop at a cold pupil in the cryostat .",
    "the coronagraphic system significantly reduces both scattered and diffracted energy from the occulted target s point spread function core by factors of 4 - 6 , compared to direct imaging ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 ; lowrance et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus our coronagraphic images have higher sensitivity than the non - coronagraphic images for detecting those foreground damped ly-@xmath0 absorber or associated companions that are much fainter than the quasar and lie outside the coronagraphic hole .    to circumvent image artifacts known as `` bars '' in all our camera 2 images , cameras 1 and 3 were run in parallel , as discussed by storrs ( 1997 ) .",
    "the images were reduced using the iraf package nicred 1.8 , developed specifically for the reduction of multiaccum nicmos data ( mcleod 1997 ) . the dark image used was that made from on - orbit dark exposures taken during the nicmos calibration program .",
    "for the non - coronagraphic images , the flat - field image used was made from on - orbit exposures taken with the internal calibration lamps during the nicmos cycle-7 calibration program .",
    "for the coronagraphic images , the flat - field image was made with target - acquisition data taken just before the coronagraphic exposures .",
    "this ensures that the coronagraphic hole is in the same position on the detector for the flat as for the quasar data , which is critical for studying faint objects close to the edge of the coronagraphic hole .",
    "( the standard calibration flats are not adequate for this purpose because the position of the coronagraphic hole on the detector changed with time , and a flat exposure taken at another time had the hole in a different place . )    first , the exposures at each individual dither position were reduced using nicred 1.8 .",
    "briefly , the steps followed by nicred 1.8 are as described below :    \\1 .",
    "subtraction of the zeroth read from successive reads , both for the quasar data and the dark data ,    \\2 .",
    "dark subtraction , read by read ,    \\3 .",
    "linearity correction , cosmic ray rejection , and fitting of slope to the successive reads in the multiaccum data , to get count rates in adu s@xmath15 ,    \\4 .",
    "correction of non - uniform bias level across the array ( `` the pedestal effect '' ) ,    \\5 . repeating step 3 on the bias - corrected image to get more accurate count rates ,    \\6 .",
    "flatfielding using the appropriate flats ,    \\7 . subtracting the median of each row from that row and then likewise for columns , to remove bands caused by bias jumps during simultaneous use of amplifiers of other cameras in parallel , and thus to improve the flatness of the background ,    \\8 .",
    "fixing bad pixels using bi - cubic spline interpolation across the neighboring pixels .",
    "the images for the different dither positions were registered by cross - correlating with the iraf task xregister .",
    "the quasar was used as the reference object since no other point sources were available in our images .",
    "finally , the registered images were averaged together using a bad - pixel mask that took out any remaining bad pixels , and rejecting pixels deviating by more than 3 @xmath14 from the average of the five f160w images , using averaged sigma - clipping .    for the f190n images , where there were five exposures ( one in each orbit ) at each of the four dither positions , we first median - combined the five exposures at each position separately , and then registered and median - combined the four positions together to make the final image . for the coronagraphic f160w images ,",
    "where there were five exposures at the same position in each of the two orbits , we averaged the exposures in each orbit separately and then took a weighted average ( weighting by exposure times ) of the combined exposures from the two orbits .    in an attempt to gain the higher spatial resolution made possible by the half - integral dithers ( in steps of 7.5 pixels )",
    ", we also experimented with magnification ( repixelization ) of the images at the individual dither positions before combining them .",
    "the images for each individual dither position processed as per steps 1 - 8 above were magnified ( i.e. numerically resampled ) by factors of two each in x and y directions .",
    "a cubic spline interpolation was used to divide the pixels into subpixels , with the flux kept conserved . as discussed further in section 6.7 , our results do not depend much on whether or not the magnification is done .    figs .",
    "1 , 2 , and 3 show the final reduced images for the non - coronagraphic f160w , non - coronagraphic f190n , and coronagraphic f160w observations .",
    "the orientations of figs .",
    "1 and 2 agree exactly while they differ from that of fig . 3 by only 2.026 degrees .",
    "all three images have an essentially zero background .",
    "the f190n image shows a weak residual flat field and nonuniformities in the corners caused by amplifier glow .",
    "this effect is much less noticeable in the reduced f160w image .",
    "we believe that the f190n image is limited by the quality of the f190n flat field available to us .",
    "the f190n flat field , made from six 192 s long in - flight exposures to calibration lamps , has a count rate of 37.72 adu s@xmath15 , while the f160w flat , made from nine 24 s exposures , has a count rate of 1113 adu s@xmath15 .",
    "the rms deviation in the count rate per pixel is about @xmath43 for each of the six frames combined to make the f190n flat , while it is about @xmath44 for each of the nine frames combined to make the f160w flat .",
    "the lack of a better f190n flat is unfortunate .",
    "however , this should not be a serious problem for the quasar and dla images , since they lie in the central part of the array .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the quasar point source along with the diffraction pattern . the coronagraphic image in fig .",
    "3 shows the quasar light to be reduced greatly , although not completely . to study whether there is any additional underlying faint emission from the dla in any of these images , we need to subtract the respective psfs",
    "reference point spread functions for subtraction were obtained by using observations of stars in the same filter / aperture combinations as those employed for the quasar imaging .",
    "psf star observations were not included in our own observations since we wanted to maximize the use of the available hst observing time for imaging of the quasar fields .",
    "we therefore used psf star observations from other programs ( in particular the stellar images from the photometric monitoring program carried out during cycle 7 nicmos calibration ) for constructing the reference psfs for subtraction .",
    "such directly observed psfs , when exposed to high s / n , are expected to provide better match to the quasar data than the theoretical tiny tim psfs ( since the observed psfs incorporate any real optical effects not simulated in tiny tim ) .",
    "we have also actually experimented with the use of calculated tiny tim psfs and find that they do indeed provide poorer match to the quasar than the observed stellar psfs .    for the non - coronagraphic images , the psf observations were chosen such that the telescope focus `` breathing '' ( bely 1993 ) values matched as closely as possible the values for the dla observations .",
    "this is important because changes in the hst focus translate into corresponding changes in the fine structure of the psf . to estimate the ota focus positions for the epoch of the quasar and psf star observations",
    ", we used the hst focus ephemerides provided by stsci ( hershey 1998 ; hershey & mitchell 1998 ) .",
    "for the non - coronagraphic f160w and f190n images , we used the psf star p330e , observed on july 8 , 1998 and may 29 , 1998 respectively .",
    "we also studied the effect of psf variations on our results by using psf observations of p330e with a range of different `` breathing '' focus positions obtained on different dates , and also by using observations of other psf stars .",
    "( see section 6.2 and 6.3 for a detailed description . ) the f160w non - coronagraphic image of p330e , made by combining four exposures of 3 s each , had a count rate of 108.10 adu s@xmath15 at the maximum of the first airy ring .",
    "the corresponding quasar image , made by combining five exposures of 512 s each , had a count rate of 1.91 adu s@xmath15 at the maximum of the first airy ring .",
    "for the f190n filter , the p330e image , made by combining three exposures of 64 s each , had 0.055 adu s@xmath15 at the maximum of the first airy ring .",
    "the corresponding count rate was 0.0013 adu s@xmath15 for the f190n quasar image , made by combining 20 exposures of 704 s each .",
    "for the coronagraphic observations , the choice of the psf star was guided by the requirement that the position of the star in the coronagraphic hole be as close as possible to that of the quasar in our observations .",
    "this is critical , because even when the target - acquisition flight software succeeds in acquiring the target and putting it in the coronagraphic hole , there are usually some small residual differences between the actual position where the target is placed and the desired position of the target in the hole , i.e. the `` low scatter point '' of the coronagraph ( see schneider 1998 for details ) .",
    "the psf wings and `` glints '' from the edge of the coronagraphic hole depend sensitively on the precise position of the point source within the hole .",
    "we therefore used the observations of star gl83.1 for which we had coronagraphic observations ( from another nicmos gto program ) , with the star placed at a position within 0.04 pixels of the position of the quasar lbqs 1210 + 1731 in our data .",
    "the observations of gl83.1 were taken on august 1 , 1998 at a breathing value close to that for our quasar coronagraphic observations .",
    "for all the `` primary '' psf star choices , the proximity of the observation dates with those of our quasar observations also ensures that the plate scale of the camera is the same for the psf and the quasar observations .",
    "all of the observations of the psf star p330e were obtained in 4-point spiral dither patterns in steps of 4.0 @xmath3 ( @xmath45 pixels ) .",
    "the dithers for the psf star were obtained by using actual spacecraft movements , while the dithers for lbqs 1210 + 1731 were obtained by moving the field offset mirror ( fom ) internal to nicmos .",
    "but the use of the fom should not cause any differences between the combined quasar psf and the reference star psf , since we registered all of the quasar exposures individually to a common reference before combining .",
    "the psf star observations were analyzed in exactly the same manner as the quasar observations , following the procedure outlined in section 3 .",
    "the same interpolation scheme was used for resampling of the psf star and quasar images .",
    "the difference in the dithering steps for the quasar and the psf star may give rise to difference in actual sampling of the quasar and psf star images .",
    "but , as described in section 6.7 , we have verified that the difference images are reproduced well when both the quasar and psf star images are numerically resampled by a factor of two .",
    "the final reduced psf star images were subtracted from the corresponding quasar images after suitable scaling and registration , using the idl program `` idp-3 '' ( lytle et al .",
    "the scale factors were chosen using the relative intensities of the psf wings in the quasar image and the psf star image .",
    "for the coronagraphic image , the relative intensities of the psf `` glints '' near the edge of the hole were also used in determining the psf scaling factor .",
    "all the parameters ( i.e. , relative x and y alignment of the psf star image with respect to the quasar image and the intensity scaling factor for the psf star image ) were fine - tuned iteratively to obtain the minimum variance in roughly 3 @xmath3 x 3 @xmath3 subregions ( around the quasar ) in the psf - subtracted image .",
    "radial plots of the quasar image , the aligned and scaled psf image , and the difference of the two were also examined to check the alignment and scaling of the psf .",
    "4a , 5a , 6a show zoomed @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48 subregions around the quasar , from the non - coronagraphic f160w , non - coronagraphic f190n , and coronagraphic f160w images shown in figs . 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively .",
    "figs . 4b , 5b",
    ", 6b show the psf - subtracted versions of figs .",
    "4a , 5a , and 6a , respectively , using the closest matching psfs available .",
    "4b shows the f160w image after subtraction of the psf image of star p330e obtained on july 8 , 1998 .",
    "the fidelity of the psf subtraction is seen from the fact that the diffraction pattern disappears completely and most of the residual image contains a random mixture of positive and negative values .",
    "the radially symmetric residuals may be explained , for the most part , by a mismatch between the sed of the quasar and that of the psf star ( spectral type g2v ) .",
    "these color terms lead to small differences in the structure and size - scale of the psfs .",
    "these differences are non - negligible under the @xmath49 bandpass of the f160w filter , but are negligible under the 1@xmath50 bandpass of the f190n filter .",
    "see section 6.3 for further discussion .",
    "the main asymmetric residual is the emission feature to the `` lower right '' of the center , about 3 pixels ( 0.26 @xmath3 ) away from the center .",
    "( this feature is seen more clearly if the data are sub - sampled by a factor of 2 , as discussed further in section 6.7 and fig . 15 . )",
    "there is no correspondingly strong and symmetrically located negative feature in the image , and the bright knot can not be made to disappear after reregistration of the psf and quasar images or rescaling of the psf image without causing large negative residuals elsewhere ( see section 6.9 and fig .",
    "we can not completely rule out that this `` knot '' is an artifact in the psf .",
    "however , given the significant excess over a number of pixels , it is likely that it is a real feature .",
    "this feature ( which we name object `` o1 '' ) is about 0.40 @xmath3 long .",
    "if this emission knot is associated with the damped ly-@xmath0 absorber at @xmath1 , then it is @xmath51 2.4 h@xmath33 kpc long for @xmath52 , or 3.2 h@xmath33 kpc long for @xmath53 . in section 6 ,",
    "we examine in detail the question of whether or not o1 is real . in this section",
    "we discuss the properties of o1 assuming that it is real and is associated with the dla absorber .",
    "the faintness and diffuse nature of object o1 make its photometry rather difficult .",
    "we estimated the flux from this object in the psf - subtracted image , using three different procedures , and then took an average of the three values .    since accurate aperture photometry is difficult ,",
    "we first estimated the flux by subtracting the psf star from object o1 , now multiplying the star by a factor large enough to make object o1 look indistinguishable from noise .",
    "this psf multiplying factor can then be used directly to estimate the flux of object o1 , since the psf star p330e is a well - calibrated nicmos photometric standard . from this method",
    ", we deduce that object o1 is @xmath54 as bright as the psf star p330e .",
    "this implies a flux of 3.22 adu s@xmath15 or 7.1 @xmath7jy in the f160w filter .",
    "to convert the count rate to flux , we used the nicmos photometric calibration factor of @xmath55 jy/(adu s@xmath15 ) for the f160w filter .",
    "this factor was derived using the solar - type photometric standard star p330e ( that we also used for psf subtraction ) .    as a rough check of the above flux value , we also did aperture photometry on a circular aperture 4 pixels in diameter centered on o1 using the iraf task apphot .",

    "as in the case of the broad - band images , the photometry of o1 is rather difficult .",

    "we get @xmath75 @xmath7jy .",
    "the error bar of 1.5 @xmath7jy denotes only the standard deviation among the three values and thus reflects the uncertainties arising from the lack of knowledge about the size and shape of o1 . for comparison ,",

    "the fact that features in the coronagraphic psf other than object o2 disappear after the psf subtraction also suggests that object o2 is not the result of misregistration of the individual exposures .",
    "we therefore believe that object o2 is likely to be real .",
    "this feature o2 is detected marginally in the non - coronagraphic f160w image ( fig .",

    "5b . however , considering that it is much fainter than object o1 , it is not entirely surprising that any emission from o2 is not detected in the narrow - band images ( which are about 10 times less sensitive , at the separation of o2 from the quasar ) . considering this , and its faintness and larger angular distance from the quasar",
    "compared to o1 , it is not completely clear whether the feature o2 has any connection with the dla .",

    "in view of the low s / n of object o1 and its small angular separation from the quasar in our non - coronagraphic f160w and f190n images , we carried out a number of tests on the images to investigate whether o1 is real or merely an artifact of the data reduction or psf subtraction procedures . here",
    "we describe these tests , listing the potential sources of error that we investigated in each case , and the corresponding results .      we have registered and normalized the psf star by varying the position and multiplicative scaling factor of the psf star so as to minimize the variance in the region of interest near the quasar .",
    "this seems to be the most objective way of judging the goodness - of - fit of the psf subtraction . to determine whether any bias could be caused by the use of the minimum - variance criterion",
    ", we also verified that the results from this method are closely consistent with k. mcleod s method of forcing the intensity at the first airy minimum to zero ( see mcleod , rieke , & storrie - lombardi 1999 ) . the psf star position given by the two methods for the optimum psf subtractions in each case",

    "therefore we believe that our strategy of minimizing the variance is sound .      to examine how sensitive the detection of the main emission knot o1 is to the fine structure of the psf subtracted , we created a suite of difference images using a variety of reference psfs for the non - coronagraphic broad - band and narrow - band images .",
    "we particularly sought to investigate the effects of hst breathing focus changes on our results .",
    "the changes in hst focus consist of two components .",
    "first , there is a long - term slow change caused by shrinkage in the optical telescope assembly ( ota ) of hst due to moisture desorption , which is periodically corrected by secondary mirror moves .",
    "in addition , short - term focus variations on the time scale of the hst orbit , arising from thermally driven displacements of the ota secondary , can be even larger in magnitude than desorption correction compensations .    fig .",

    "therefore the intra - pixel response function , in addition to focus changes , could also account for some of the differences between the different psf images .   in any case , the symmetric nature of the residuals in fig . 8 and the absence of the knot o1 in these images suggests that the latter feature is present in the quasar images , and not an artifact in any individual psf image .",

    "the first dither position as well as the combined image ( bottom right panel ) show an asymmetric excess emission near the position of object o1 .",
    "this suggests that the feature o1 is not caused by errors arising from column 127 , since none of the dither positions considered in fig .",
    "13 include this column .      the experiments with psf subtraction on the individual dithers described in test ( 6.4 ) above also help to show that image persistence effects are not important in causing feature o1 .",
    "this is because even the very first dither position ( which should not suffer from quasar persistence effects ) shows the presence of an asymmetric feature at the location of o1 ( see the top left panel of fig .",

    "we therefore conclude that while the difference in the pam positions for the quasar and the psf star could cause some of the residuals in our psf subtractions , they can not be the major source of these residuals .",
    "to pursue this analysis further , we took the ratio of the two simulated tiny tim psfs after correction for plate - scales , and multiplied this ratio by the actual observed p330e psf to make our `` best - guess '' psf .",
    "the resultant psf has the advantages of combining the correct focus ( pam ) position ( because of the tiny tim simulation ) , the best estimate of breathing ( because of use of the actual observation of p330e which matches closely in breathing with the lbqs 1210 + 1731 data ) , and any other actual optical effects that tiny tim does not simulate adequately . in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "14 , we show the resultant image obtained after subtracting this `` best - guess '' synthetic p330e psf from the lbqs 1210 + 1731 data .",
    "once again , excess emission is seen at the position of o1 .",
    "this suggests that o1 is not caused by artifacts of relative focus difference ( `` camera 1 - 2 '' focus vs. `` camera 2 '' focus ) between the quasar and the psf star .",
    "we used nicred 1.8 to interpolate the registered dithers onto a grid of single camera 2 pixels , or onto a grid of half integer camera 2 pixels .",

    "the individual 512-s exposures at each of the 5 dither positions in the f160w image of our quasar have peaks of about 15000 adu or 83000 e@xmath86 in the quasar central pixel .",

    "we have shown shifts of 0.1 pixel in fig .",

    "but , judging by the minimum in the variance , we believe that our relative alignment of the quasar and psf star images is good to at least 0.01 pixel .",

    "the different dither positions are registered in nicred 1.8 using cross - correlation .",

    "the centroid values for any individual dither position calculated from different methods ( tasks imexam , center , and starfind in iraf ) were also found to agree within about 0.06 pixels .",
    "thus , there is a small uncertainty in the centroid values , but it does not seem large enough to cause a feature such as o1 . the fact that the individual dither positions show some excess at the position of o1 ( fig . 13 ) also suggests that o1 is not a spurious feature resulting from stacking errors .",
    "\\(a ) comparison of psf stars with each other : psf stars seem to subtract very well from each other , with the same caveat about color and breathing .",

    "we have also reduced the data for the other quasars with dlas from our sample , which will be described in separate papers ( kulkarni et al .",

    "this suggests that part of the emission at the position of o1 is likely to be real , although part of it could be some artifact that we have not yet understood despite the large number of data analysis experiments described above .",
    "overall , we conclude that the best - fitting psf and several others with reasonably close breathing values suggest a possible detection of an object ( object `` o1 '' ) located at about 0.25 @xmath3 from the quasar center , in both the f160w and f190n images . the appearance and properties of this object",
    "are more sensitive to the important step of psf subtraction than to other data reduction steps such as flat fielding . however , our extensive tests suggest that this object is not an artifact of color or focus mismatch or spatial misalignment between the quasar and psf star images .",
    "it is also not caused by image persistence or saturation or by the procedures used for interpolation or stacking of the individual images .",
    "we therefore believe that object o1 is likely to be real .",
    "the most relevant broad and narrow band summary images showing object o1 are the zoomed , magnified , psf subtracted images in figs . 15 ( b ) and 16 ( b ) .",

    ", we can use our images to put very sensitive upper limits on the size and brightness of both the dla absorber and the quasar host .",
    "we discuss the implications of our observations in the following section .",
    "the most important result from our observations is that there are no large bright galaxies close to the quasar in the field of the dla absorber toward lbqs 1210 + 1731 .",
    "feature o1 is the most likely candidate for any object associated with the dla . in subsections 7.1 , 7.2 , and 7.3",
    ", we assume that object o1 is associated with the dla to derive constraints on various properties of dlas .",
    "but we also consider alternative possibilities in subsection 7.4 , mainly the possibility that o1 may be associated with the host galaxy of the quasar .",
    "our observations show no evidence for a big , well - formed galaxy as expected in some scenarios for the dlas [ e.g. , the proto - spiral model suggested by wolfe et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 , 1998 ) , jedamzik & prochaska ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "feature o1 has an estimated size of 2 - 3 @xmath5 kpc , while feature o2 , if real , consists of small knots spread over about 4 - 5 @xmath5 kpc .",
    "thus , these data suggest that the absorber is compact and clumpy , as expected in the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation",
    ". however , it is hard to be completely certain of the morphology , partly because of the sensitivity of the detailed image structure to the various factors discussed in sec .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that o1 and o2 are the brightest regions within a bigger galaxy , the rest of which we can not see .",
    "thus , we can not completely rule out the large disk scenario , although the compact sizes and low sfrs suggest that the hierarchical picture may be favored .",
    "analysis of the other dlas from our sample and further deeper observations will help to more definitively distinguish between the large disk vs. hierarchical models .",
    "apart from features o1 and o2 very close to the quasar , our images show two prominent galaxies in the non - coronagraphic f160w image ( one in the upper left corner or west of the quasar and the other at the middle of the left edge of the image or roughly north of the quasar see fig .",
    "1 ) . there is also a third very weak feature to the left ( roughly north ) of the quasar , a little less than half the way along the line joining the quasar and the galaxy at the middle left edge .",
    "the galaxy west of the quasar is just barely apparent in the non - coronagraphic f190n image , while the other two objects are not seen in the non - coronagraphic f190n image .",

    "but on running maximum - entropy and lucy deconvolutions of the images , all the three objects ( including the faint feature ) in the f160w image were found to remain significant .",

    ", they have fairly large impact parameters ( 4.52 @xmath3 , 11.00 @xmath3 , and 10.96 @xmath3 for the faint feature , the galaxy to the west of the quasar , and the galaxy to the north of the quasar , respectively ) . at the redshift of the dla absorber",
    ", these impact parameters would correspond to 26.8 , 65.1 and 64.9 h@xmath33 kpc respectively , for q@xmath92 . for q@xmath93 ,",
    "the corresponding values are 36.6 , 89.0 , and 88.6 h@xmath33 kpc .",
    "these large values make it unlikely for any of these features to be the dla absorber itself .    if real , the continuum emission knots in object o2 may be highlighting the brightest regions in a companion to the dla galaxy .",
    "the roughly filamentary morphology may indicate an edge - on disk galaxy or a part of a spiral arm .",
    "alternatively , it may suggest individual star - forming sub - galactic clumps formed in a filamentary over - dense region , similar to the filamentary arrangements of galaxies and sub - galactic units found in numerical simulations of structure formation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the wfpc2 observations of a @xmath94 dla by mller & warren ( 1998 ) also indicate a filamentary arrangement of 3 bright objects , although on a much larger scale ( separation of 21 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the angular separation of their closest object from the quasar was 1.17 @xmath3 , whereas for our features o1 and o2 , the angular separations are @xmath95@xmath48 and @xmath96@xmath48 , respectively .",

    "<S> the images were obtained in the broad filter f160w and the narrow filter f190n with camera 2 on nicmos , and were aimed at detecting the absorber in the rest - frame optical continuum and in h-@xmath0 line emission from the dla absorber . </S>",

    "<S> if associated with the dla , the object would be @xmath4 @xmath5 kpc in size with a flux of @xmath6 @xmath7jy in the f160w filter , implying a luminosity at @xmath8  in the rest frame of @xmath9 @xmath10 l@xmath11 at @xmath12 , for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a comparison of the fluxes in the broad and narrow filters indicates that most of the flux in the narrow - band filter is continuum emission , rather than red - shifted h-@xmath0 line emission . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that if this object is the absorber , then either it has a low star formation rate ( sfr ) , with a 3 @xmath14 upper limit of 4.0 @xmath10 m@xmath11 yr@xmath15 , or dust obscuration is important . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the h-@xmath0 emission may be extinguished by dust , but this seems unlikely , given the typically low dust - to - gas ratios observed in dlas . </S>",

    "<S> the two objects we report mark the closest detected high - redshift dla candidates yet to any quasar sight line . if the features in our images are associated with the dla , they suggest faint , compact , somewhat clumpy objects rather than large , well - formed proto - galactic disks or spheroids . </S>",
