    "later it was demonstrated how to let the planar origamis self - assemble into 3d nano - structures such as a box  @xcite .",
    "ever since the pioneering work of adlemann in 1994  @xcite , dna has also been recognized as a massively parallel , versatile , and inexpensive computing substrate . in order for such substrate to be of practical interest , however , it is desirable that the computational framework is scalable and that individual computational elements can be combined to form circuits .",
    "recently , a scalable approach to enzyme - free dna computing has been proposed where circuits consist of relatively short dna strands that communicate via strand displacement  @xcite .",
    "the poland - scheraga ( ps ) model has been very successful in predicting thermal melting and renaturing of long dna strands  @xcite .",

    "generalizations of the ps model exists , where the single strands are represented as semi - flexible polymers on a 3d lattice  @xcite .",
    "this provides a conceptual simplification since the polymer free energy contributions are given implicitly .",
    "the dauxois - peyrard - bishop@xcite ( dpb ) model represents a dna double strand as a 1d lattice , but each base - pair is described by a continuous base - pair extension .",
    "the dpb model is defined by a hamiltonian which includes a hybridization potential and a harmonic term penalizing deviations between nearest neighbor extensions .",
    "the chemical structure of short dna oligomers can be studied with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations such as amber@xcite and charmm@xcite . however ,",

    "coarse - graining is the statistical mechanical process by which microscopic details are systematically removed , producing an effective mesoscopic model  @xcite .",
    "the major computational advantage of coarse - graining is that it allows us to focus our computational resources on studying the structures and dynamics at the mesoscopic level .",

    "savelyev and papoian  @xcite have formulated a `` one site per nucleotide '' model . as the number of interaction sites per nucleotide is reduced ,",
    "the chemical structure is progressively lost . in simulations of dna tagged nanoparticles , even more coarse - grained models are used .",
    "dna molecules have been modeled e.g. as semi - flexible polymers with attractive sites on each monomer  @xcite , or as a single sticky site that can be hybridized with free complementary free sticky sites  @xcite . while the chemical structure of dna has been completely eliminated",

    "we study a minimal dynamic bonding dna model . for simplicity , we assume that the binding energy , as well as the bond , angular , and dihedral potentials are independent of sequence , and we have chosen a force field that produces a flat ladder - like structure in the double stranded state .",
    "our motivation for these choices are to minimize the number of parameters required to specify the dna model .",

    "in the present dynamic bonding dna model , single stranded dna ( ssdna ) is represented by a string of nucleotide beads connected by stiff springs representing directional backbone bonds . instead of using a four letter alphabet representing the acgt nucleotides , in the present paper we increase the alphabet maximally to avoid getting trapped in transiently hybridized states .",
    "physically , this corresponds to assuming that each bead represents a short sequence of nucleotides i.e. a domain , and that two non - complementary beads or domains are unable to hybridize .",
    "a novel feature of our dna model is that it involves dynamic hybridization bonds , which are introduced or removed between complementary interaction sites or beads when they enter or exit the hybridization reaction radius .",
    "along with the bonds , we dynamically introduce or remove angular and dihedral interactions in the chemical neighborhood of a hybridizing bead pair .",
    "these interactions are introduced based on the local bond and bead type pattern , and hence allows us to retain some effects of the local chemical structure in coarse - grained models .",
    "we utilize bonds carrying directionality to represent the 3-5 backbone structure of dna molecules .",
    "this allows us to introduce dihedral interactions that can distinguish between parallel and anti - parallel strand alignments .",
    "we have implemented this framework in a modified version of the large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator ( lammps )  @xcite .",
    "the dna model relies on two ingredients , a langevin dynamic for propagating a system in time and space , and a dynamic directional bonding scheme  @xcite that propagates the chemical structure of the system .",

    ", we could demonstrate how the displacement process is prevented .",
    "our simulations also capture potential failures of gates based on strand displacement , namely spontaneous release of the output strand in the absence of an input signal .",
    "these proof of concept simulations demonstrate how our coarse - grained model can be used to optimize the length and arrangement of toehold and domain structures in dna computing approaches .    while such gate optimizations do not necessarily require spatially resolved models , our coarse - grained dna model enables us to study systems that integrate dna assembly and computing within a single framework .",
    "this enables us to use these simulations as a starting point for building and testing statistical mechanical theories describing these complex systems .",
