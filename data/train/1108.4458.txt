    "<S> ( [ f2 ] ) by interchanging @xmath49 and @xmath50 with each other , i.e. , @xmath51 due to @xmath52 symmetry , we find other relations of the decay amplitudes @xmath53 where decay amplitudes @xmath54 @xmath55 correspond to fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ diagram ] are weakly dependent on the values of the parameter @xmath83 , which is consistent with that found in ref . @xcite . because we only focus on the line shapes of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the maxima of the line shapes in fig . </S>",

    "<S> our theoretical calculation indicates ( 1 ) there exist explicit sharp peaks close to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 thresholds in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum distributions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also find the reflections of these sharp peaks on the lower side of the invariant mass ; ( 2 ) the broad structures close to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 thresholds appear in the @xmath84 invariant mass spectrum distribution , which are due to the overlapping peaks of two corresponding reflections ; ( 3 ) in the @xmath85 invariant mass spectrum , we also find a structure around @xmath5 threshold , which is narrower than that appearing in the @xmath84 invariant mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also find a small peak around @xmath6 and its reflection , which are close to each other ; ( 4 ) the intermediate @xmath31 contribution to the hidden - bottom dipion decays of @xmath0 does not give the phenomena similar to those from the intermediate @xmath5 and @xmath6 states contributing to @xmath0 decays just described above . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , we notice the differences between these results , which are mainly due to the change of mass of the initial state , i.e. , the mass of @xmath0 is different from that of @xmath10 ( 10860 mev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of line shapes in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram ] indicates that the line shapes are dependent on the the definite hidden - bottom dipion decays of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> although we have obtained the peak structures just shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram ] , these are not typical breit - wigner type distributions when subtracting the contribution from the reflection . </S>",
    "<S> thus , use of mass and width to specify these peak structures is not appropriate and realistic . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to emphasize that the sharp peak structures appear in the corresponding invariant mass spectrum , which can be tested in future experiment .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , in this letter we study the hidden - bottom dipion decays of @xmath0 by the ispe mechanism , which has been first proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to study two charged @xmath86 structures observed by belle @xcite and has also been applied to investigate the hidden - charm dipion decays of higher charmonia @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we predict the charged bottom - like structures close to the @xmath5 and @xmath87 thresholds , which exist in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 invariant mass spectra of the hidden - bottom dipion decays of @xmath0 . just indicated in this letter , these charged peak structures are predicted due to the ispe mechanism , a peculiar effect involved in the decays of higher bottomonia and/or charmonia @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we must admit that there exists interference between background and the ispe contributions , where in this work we do not include background contribution due to our ignorance to background contribution . to some extend </S>",
    "<S> , such interference effect could bring some uncertainty to our prediction .    at present , there only exist the experimental measurements of the mass and width for @xmath0 @xcite while the information of its strong decay behaviors is still absent @xcite . to some extent , </S>",
    "<S> the prediction presented in this letter could stimulate experimentalists interest in carrying out further study on @xmath0 , especially on its hidden - bottom dipion decays . </S>",
    "<S> besides belle and babar , the forthcoming belle ii experiment @xcite will provide a good platform to study the properties of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the superb factory has been approved by the italian government in the last year @xcite , which is also suitable to study the bottomonium decays . here </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest these experimental search for the predicted charged bottomonium - like structures around the @xmath5 and @xmath87 thresholds by the hidden - bottom dipion decays of @xmath0 , which will provide a crucial test on the ispe mechanism @xcite .    this project is supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grants nos . </S>",
