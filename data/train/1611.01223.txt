    "angulon represents a rotational analogue of polaron , actively studied in the context of solid state and atomic settings @xcite .",
    "however , non - commutativity and discrete energy spectrum inherent to quantum rotations renders the angulon physics substantially different compared to any of the polaron models .",
    "the concept of angulon considerably simplifies the problems involving an impurity possessing orbital angular momentum immersed into a bath of bosons .",
    "thereby it paves the way for understanding cold molecules rotating inside superfluid helium nanodroplets @xcite and ultracold gases @xcite , rydberg electrons in bose ",
    "einstein condensates @xcite , electronic excitations coupled to phonons in solids @xcite , and several other systems .",
    "the angulon operator describes a linear - rotor molecule dressed by the bosonic field .",
    "the operator consists of the kinetic energies of a molecule and the bosonic field , as well as the interaction potential .",
    "the kinetic energy of a molecule is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the rotational constant and where the vector - valued operator @xmath7 is called the angular momentum operator of a linear - rotor impurity .",
    "the bosonic part of the hamiltonian for a molecular impurity describes bosons with some dispersion relation ( typically @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ) and with contact interactions .",
    "using the bogoliubov transformation which maps bosonic particles to quasi - particles , called phonons , one transforms the bosonic part to the hamiltonian that describes phonons with a dispersion relation , say @xmath10 .",
    "one further expresses the creation / annihilation operators of phonons in the angular momentum basis so that the kinetic energy of the bosonic field is the free hamiltonian , @xmath11 , of mass @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the sum of occupation numbers corresponding to the @xmath14th phonon state ; @xmath14 runs over the set @xmath15 of pairs @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the _ phonon angular momentum _ and @xmath18 .",
    "the integration is performed over @xmath19 .    in its original form , the interaction potential is given by @xmath20 the angular momentum dependent coupling @xmath21 signifies the strength of the potential and it depends on the microscopic details of the two - body interaction between the impurity and the bosons @xcite ; typically , @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",

    "the analysis of higher - order phonon excitations , the authors in @xcite make a one step further by introducing a rotation operator which is generated by the collective angular momentum operator of the many - body bath .",
    "the angular momentum operator has the highest weight @xmath42 and the total angular momentum @xmath36 is obtained by reducing @xmath37{\\otimes}[\\lambda]$ ] in a standard way .",
    "the transformation is useful when the rotational constant @xmath43 , since in this regime the transformed angulon operator can be diagonalized .",
    "still , the eigenvalue is calculated by using the variational ansatz based on _ single - phonon _ excitations , though on top of the transformed operator .",
    "in this paper we propose a scheme for treating higher - order phonon excitations self - consistently .",
    "we do not rely on the limit of a slowly rotating impurity ( @xmath43 ) , nor we need an auxiliary variational ansatz .",
    "in fact , we construct a reference hilbert space so that , to some extent , the ansatz is represented by an element of that space ( _ cf . _ and ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , in our approach the number @xmath44 of phonon excitations is arbitrarily large but finite .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath45 is then obtained by reducing the tensor product of @xmath46 copies of @xmath34-irreducible representations @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the latter requires some angular momentum algebra , but the exposition becomes elegant once we introduce certain symmetrization coefficients . as a result , we come by the system of @xmath0 equations whose solutions form the eigenspace of the angulon operator .    to achieve our goals , we reformulate the definition of the angulon operator , which we now show is equivalent to the original one .",

    "the crucial point is that now we are able to put the sum @xmath13 of occupation numbers aside in a certain sense and yet to considerably simplify the spectral analysis of the angulon operator independently of @xmath13 .",

    "we see that and the vanishing commutators @xmath99=0 , \\quad   [ b_{\\iota , d}^*,b_{\\iota^\\prime , d^\\prime}^*]=0\\ ] ] together define an infinite - dimensional heisenberg algebra .",
    "thus we have that both the creation / annihilation operators defined via the operator - valued distributions ( as in ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
