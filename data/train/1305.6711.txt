    "one - dimensional driven - diffusion systems have been a subject of study in recent years because they exhibit interesting properties such as non - equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "these systems have many applications in different fields of physics and biology  @xcite .",
    "a well - known example is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , which is studied experimentally by optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "various approaches have been developed in order to solve such systems exactly , including for example the matrix product method . with the matrix product method ,",
    "the steady - state weight of a configuration is written as the trace of a product of operators corresponding to the local state of each lattice site .",
    "the operators obey certain algebraic rules which are derived from the dynamics of the model  @xcite .",
    "the algebraic relations among these operators might have finite or infinite dimensional matrix representations  @xcite .",
    "recently the matrix product method with quadratic algebras attracted renewed attention as it can also be applied to dissipative quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that one - dimensional systems with open boundary conditions , in which the particle number is not conserved at the boundaries , can exhibit a phase transition  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "a phase transition may also take place in systems with non - conserving dynamics in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have studied a three - states model on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions with two particle species which evolve by diffusion , creation and annihilation . by changing the annihilation rate of the particles , this model displays a transition from a maximal current phase to a fluid phase .    as shown in  @xcite it is possible to map a one - dimensional driven - diffusive system defined on a periodic lattice onto a so - called zero - range process ( zrp ) .",
    "recently this mapping was used to study various models which have an exact solution in the steady state  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a phase transition in the original model corresponds to a condensation transition in the corresponding zrp .    in present work ,",
    "we introduce and study an exactly solvable one - dimensional driven - diffusive model with non - conserved dynamics which exhibits an interesting type of phase transition .",
    "the model is defined on a ring of @xmath4 sites which can be either empty ( denoted by a vacancy @xmath5 ) or occupied by a one particle of type @xmath0 or type @xmath1 .",
    "the system evolves random - sequentially according to a set of two - site processes which can be written in the most general form as @xmath6 where @xmath7 . in what follows",
    "we study a special case of this model defined by the processes @xmath8 where the rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given by the ratios @xmath11 as we will see below , for this particular choice the model turns out to be exactly solvable .",
    "obviously , this defines a non - conserved dynamics , allowing the number of particles ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and vacancies ( @xmath14 ) to fluctuate under the constraint @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the model is a driven system since diffusion and reaction processes are not left - right symmetric . the dynamical rules  ( [ dynamical rule ] ) is extensible to an exactly solvable model with the various types of particles , in which a phase transition is accessible .",
    "a generalized model consisting of three species of particles is presented in the appendix a.    in this paper we demonstrate that the model defined in  ( [ dynamicalrules ] ) exhibits a phase transition and that its stationary state can be determined exactly by means of the matrix product method . in sect .",
    "[ sec : zrp ] we show that our model can be mapped onto a zrp and that the phase transition corresponds to a condensation transition in the zrp . in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we study the dynamical behavior , which is not part of the exact solution , by numerical simulations .",
    "it turns out that the dynamical behavior near the critical point is plagued by unusually persistent corrections to scaling , which are explained from a phenomenological point of view in sect .",
    "[ sec : toymodel ] .",
    "the model exhibits two different phases , namely a high - density phase for @xmath16 ( red ) and a low - density phase for @xmath17 ( violet ) , separated by a discontinuous phase transition when moving along the bottom line in the left panel . for @xmath18 the order parameter @xmath19 changes continuously without exhibiting a phase transition .",
    "right : the order parameter @xmath20 displays instead a continuous phase transition . ]",
    "[ sec : phase diagram ] the model defined above is controlled by four parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "as we will see below , the essential quantities which determine the matrix algebra are the ratios @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ ratios ] ) , and therefore it is useful to study the phase diagram of the model in terms of these ratios . for the remaining two degrees of freedom",
    "we choose @xmath27 throughout this paper , i.e. we use the definition @xmath28 this selects a 2d subspace in the 4d parameter space which is believed to capture the essential phase structure of the system .",
    "the phase diagram for the particle densities @xmath19 and @xmath20 in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rho ] . as can be seen , these densities vary continuously everywhere except for the point @xmath29 , where the model exhibits a phase transition . moving along the horizontal axis at @xmath30 ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath19 jumps discontinuously from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , indicating first - order behavior , while @xmath20 changes continuously as in a second - order phase transition .    to give a first impression how the process behaves in different parts of the phase diagram , we show various typical snapshots of the space - time evolution in fig .  [",
    "fig : demo ] .",
    "for @xmath33 the density of @xmath1-particles ( blue pixels ) is very low while the @xmath0-particles ( red pixels ) form fluctuating domains with a high density .",
    "as we will see in the last section , these sharply bounded domains are important for a qualitative understanding of the phase transition .",
    "for @xmath16 the @xmath0-particles eventually fill the entire system while for @xmath34 the @xmath0-domains almost disappear , leaving diffusing @xmath1-particles behind . for @xmath18",
    "one can see that @xmath1-particles are continuously generated .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath9 controls the domain size of @xmath0-particles while the parameter @xmath10 controls the creation and therewith the density of @xmath1-particles .",
    "the matrix product method is an important analytical tool developed in the 90 s to compute the steady - state of driven diffusive systems exactly  @xcite .",
    "let us now investigate the stationary state of the model by using this method .",
    "we consider a configuration @xmath35 with @xmath36 on a discrete lattice of length @xmath4 with periodic boundary condition . according to this method ,",

    ", the operator @xmath41 stands for a vacancy while @xmath42 represents a particle of type @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . depending on the dynamical rules , these operators should satisfy a certain set of algebraic relations . for the dynamical rules listed in  ( [ dynamicalrules ] )",
    "one obtains a quadratic algebra of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an auxiliary matrix which is expected to cancel out in the final result .",
    "we find that the algebra  ( [ algebra ] ) has a two - dimensional matrix representation given by the following matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is an identity @xmath48 matrix .",
    "we note that the algebra ( [ algebra ] ) and its representation ( [ matrix a , b , e ] ) were studied for the first time by basu and mohanty in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a different model .",
    "it differs from our one in so far as it evolves only according to the processes in the first two lines of ( [ dynamicalrules ] ) , where the @xmath0 and @xmath1-particles hop with different rates and can also transform into each other , meaning that the total number of particles is conserved .",
    "the authors calculated the spatial correlations exactly and mapped their model to a zrp .",
    "however , as the particle number is conserved in their model , a phase transition does not occur by changing the rates .",
    "in other words , although the matrix algebra already contains information about the phase transition , their model could not access the part of the phase diagram where the transition takes place .",
    "the model presented here is an extension of their model with the same matrix representation but with a non - conserved dynamics and an extended parameter space , in which the phase transition becomes accessible .    to compute the partition sum of the system",
    ", we first note that according to ( [ dynamicalrules ] ) a configuration without a particle of type @xmath0 or @xmath1 is not dynamically accessible .",

    "in fact , it is clear from ( @xmath60 ) that for @xmath30 , the @xmath1-particles can only transform into @xmath0-particles or vacancies but they are not created . hence , in the steady state in the thermodynamic limit , the @xmath1-particles will disappear .",
    "we also observe that the density of the @xmath1-particles in the vicinity of the critical point changes discontinuously in a particular limit .",

    "it is known that various driven - diffusive systems can be mapped onto a zrp @xcite .",
    "this is usually done by interpreting the vacancies ( particles ) in the driven - diffusive systems as particles ( boxes ) in the zrp .",

    "therefore , we have a condensation transition where a large number of particles accumulate in a single @xmath0-box .",
    "since all stationary properties of the model defined in ( [ dynamicalrules ] ) can be computed exactly , our numerical simulations focus on its dynamical evolution .",

    "the behavior turns out to be qualitatively similar in all cases : while the density @xmath121 seems to increase slightly , the density @xmath122 shows a decay reminding of a power law @xmath123 .",
    "however , if we first estimate the exponent @xmath124 and then divide the data by @xmath125 one observes a significant curvature of the data : the effective exponent @xmath126 decreases from 0.6 down 0.57 without having reached a stable value in the numerically accessible regime , indicating strong scaling corrections .",
    "it turns out that the effective exponent depends strongly on the particle densities in the initial state .",
    "this freedom can be used to reduce the influence of the scaling corrections .",
    "choosing for example a random initial configuration with @xmath127 and @xmath128 one obtains a less pronounced curvature of @xmath122 with an effective exponent of only @xmath129 .",

    "an overall bias does not change the critical properties of the model and can be eliminated in a co - moving frame , as sketched schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymodel]d .    having completed this sequence of simplifications , the original process can be interpreted as an effective pair - creating and annihilating random walk of @xmath161 and @xmath160 charges according to the reaction - diffusion scheme @xmath162 here the parameter @xmath163 controls the relative bias between the two particle species and thus it is expected to play the same role as @xmath9 in the full model , although with a different critical value @xmath164 .",

    "this impression is confirmed by a measurement of the average distance between neighboring charges shown in the lower left panel . likewise , the average number of adjacent @xmath172 and @xmath184 pairs evolves differently.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to find out how fast the effective force decreases with time , we first note that the force is caused by adjacent @xmath172 pairs which can not penetrate each other .",
    "a numerical measurement shows that the number of @xmath172 pairs decays in the same way as the squared particle density , i.e. like in a mean - field approximation ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : expl ] ) , while the number of @xmath184 pairs is  as expected  proportional to the particle loss : @xmath187 therefore , we expect the effective force to be proportional to @xmath188 which roughly scales as @xmath189 .",
    "thus we conclude that the particle density of the pair annihilation process at the critical point ( and similarly in the full model ) decays in the same way as the survival probability of a one - dimensional random walk starting at the origin subjected to a time - dependent bias proportional to @xmath190 towards the origin , terminating upon the first passage of the origin .",
    "in fact , simulating such a random walk we find slowly - decaying logarithmic corrections of the same type , confirming the heuristic arguments given above . to our knowledge an exact solution of a first - passage random walk with time - dependent bias is not yet known .",
    "in this work we have introduced and studied a two - species reaction - diffusion process on a one - dimensional periodic lattice which exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition . its stationary state can be determined exactly by means of the matrix product method .",
    "together with numerical studies of the dynamics we have identified the critical exponents which are listed in table  [ tab : exponents ] .",
    "the transition can be explained qualitatively by relating the model to a reduced process ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : toymodel ] ) .",
    "this relation also provides a heuristic explanation of the unusual corrections to scaling observed in this model .",
    "our findings seem to be in contradiction with a previous claim by one of the authors  @xcite that first - order phase transitions in non - conserving systems with fluctuating domains should be impossible in one dimension . in @xcite it was argued that a first - order transition needs a robust mechanism in order to eliminate spontaneously generated minority islands of the opposite phase , but this would be impossible in 1d because in this case the minority islands do not have surface tension . although this claim was originally restricted to two - state models , the question arises why we find the contrary in the present case .    again the caricature of the reduced process sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymodel]a provides a possible explanation : as can be seen there are two types of white patches , namely , large islands with a blue @xmath1-particle at the left boundary , and small islands without .",
    "this means that the @xmath1-particles are used for marking two different types of vacant islands , giving them different dynamical properties .",
    "only the large islands containing a @xmath1-particle are minority islands in the sense discussed in  @xcite , while the small islands without @xmath1-particles inside the @xmath0-domains are biased to shrink by themselves .",
    "therefore , we arrive at the conclusion that first - order phase transitions in non - conserving 1d systems with fluctuating domains are indeed possible in certain models with several particle species if one of the species is used for marking different types of minority islands .",
    "in this appendix , we show that a similar type of phase transition can also exist in four - state models .",
    "we introduce an exactly solvable one - dimensional driven - diffusive model with non - conserved dynamics consisting of three species of particles .",
    "the system evolves random - sequentially according to the dynamical rules  ( [ dynamical rule ] ) where @xmath191 .",
    "this system is defined by the processes @xmath192 where the rates @xmath9 , @xmath193 , @xmath10 and @xmath165 are given by the ratios @xmath194 the first four lines of  ( [ dynamical3particles ] ) have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where the phase transition is not accessible .",
    "we have found that the matrix algebra of the dynamical rules  ( [ dynamical3particles ] ) has a three - dimensional matrix representation given by the following matrices @xmath195 the representation  ( [ matrix a , b , c , e ] ) is the same as the matrix representation represented in ref .",
