    "m 82 is a star - burst galaxy located at 3.9 mpc ( sakai & madore , 1999 ) .",
    "it has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath8 l@xmath9 and a large body of observational data exists for this system .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity of m 82 is modest at @xmath10 erg s@xmath7 and rosat and asca data indicate that it has a hard , strongly absorbed ( @xmath11 @xmath5 ) power - law component and diffuse thermal contributions at @xmath12 and @xmath13 kev ( moran & lehnert 1997 ) .",
    "more recent xmm observations indicate a range of temperatures from 0.2 - 1.6 kev , peaking at 0.7 kev , for the diffuse thermal component ( read & stevens 2002 ) .",
    "the thermal contributions result from the star - burst superwind and the star formation itself ( supernova heating of the ism ) .",
    "there is a compact hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray component that is absorbed with a photon index of 1.7 in the nucleus m 82 , and that varies on a 62 days period ( kaaret , simet & lang 2006a , b ) .",
    "there is a modest , @xmath14 erg s@xmath7 , 2 - 8 kev diffuse component ( strickland & heckman 2007 ) .",
    "the work of moran & lehnert ( 1997 ) argues that the intrinsic luminosity of m 82 in the 0.1 - 10 kev band is about four times larger when absorption is properly taken into account , yielding about @xmath15 erg s@xmath7 in total .",
    "the co@xmath0 chemistry presented here is most sensitive to the softer diffuse thermal component ( which is largely absorbed for our model clouds ) , so subtleties in the hard 2 - 10 kev band do not impact the presented results .",
    "there is no clear evidence of an agn ( i.e. , a buried seyfert nucleus ) in m 82 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is about @xmath16% of the total fuv energy budget as measured by the fir luminosity ( pak et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the center of the late - type galaxy m  82 , bright ( and optically thin ) co@xmath0 n=2 - 1 , j=5/2 - 3/2 ( 236.06 ghz ) and j=3/2 - 1/2 ( 235.79 ghz ) rotational emission has been observed by fuente et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . based on combined cn and hco@xmath0 measurements ( their figure 2 and table 2 ) ,",
    "the latter authors argue for a clumpy photon - dominated region ( pdr ) model where @xmath17 @xmath3 clumps are embedded in an inter - clump medium and are exposed to an enhancement in the fuv radiation radiation field of @xmath18 .",
    "this enhancement is with respect to the average far - ultraviolet ( 6 - 13.6 ev ) instellar radiation field in the milky way , which enjoys a typical fuv flux of @xmath19 erg s@xmath7 @xmath5 .",
    "it is certainly established that fuv photons produced by the vigorous star formation in m 82 dominate the state of the molecular gas in its center ( e.g. , pak et al .",
    "2004 and references therein for ro - vibrational h@xmath20 as well as [ cii ] and [ oi ] fine - structure emission ) , and observations of co , hco@xmath0 and cn can be explained as well by a pdr interpretation .",
    "however , co@xmath0 is under - abundant by at least an order of magnitude in such pdr models , compared to the observed co@xmath0 columns of @xmath4 @xmath5 ( fuente et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate whether the large co@xmath0 columns measured toward m 82 by fuente et al .",
    "( 2006 ) can be explained by the irradiation of molecular gas by the modest x - ray component that m 82 exhibits , without violating the clear merits of pdr physics .",
    "we have constructed a set of pdr and x - ray dominated region ( xdr ) models from the codes described by meijerink & spaans ( 2005 ) , meijerink , spaans & israel ( 2006 ) and meijerink , spaans & israel ( 2007 ) in which we vary both the incident radiation field , density and cosmic - ray ionization rate . the thermal balance ( with line transfer )",
    "is calculated self - consistently with the chemical balance through iteration .",
    "absorption cross sections for x - rays are smaller , @xmath21 , than for fuv photons .",
    "therefore , pdrs show a stratified structure while the changes in the chemical and thermal structure in xdrs are very gradual . in xdrs ,",
    "additional reactions for fast electrons that ionize , excite and heat the gas are included .",
    "the heating efficiency in xdrs is much higher .",
    "since we focus on galaxy centers , we have assumed the metallicity to be twice solar .",
    "we take the abundance of carbon to be equal to that of oxygen , since the carbon abundance increases faster than oxygen for larger metallicity .",
    "the precise c : o ratio does not affect our general results , with the exception of o@xmath20 and h@xmath20o abundances ( bergin et al .",
    "2000 , spaans & van dishoeck 2001 ) .",
    "because the metallicity , even for a system like m 82 , is generally poorly known in the central regions of active star formation , we have also run models with solar metallicity .",
    "we come back to these in the discussion section .    our models ( meijerink et al .",
    "2007 ) have @xmath22  @xmath3 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath5 ) .",
    "we adopt a standard size for our model clouds of 1 or 10 pc .",
    "our x - ray spectrum follows the spectral characteristics observed for m 82 , corrected for extinction by the observed hydrogen column density ( @xmath25 @xmath5 ) .",
    "this attenuation is important ( factor of four ) and is the reason why the total x - ray luminosity is about @xmath15 erg s@xmath7 ( see introduction ) .",
    "the x - ray spectral shape matters a lot for the penetration of photons in particular energy bands .",
    "still , for the case of m 82 , molecular ion formation is not very sensitive to the exact spectrum .",
    "overall most of the m 82 x - ray energy is emitted below a few kev .",
    "now , a purely soft spectrum would be absorbed quickly in the outer layers of the xdr , while a purely hard spectrum would penetrate all the way through .",
    "but to first order it is the total energy deposition rate , basically the integral of the absorbed flux , that drives the chemistry ( meijerink & spaans 2005 ) .",
    "our model clouds , with @xmath26 @xmath5 per cloud , are chosen such that they absorb the bulk of the diffuse thermal x - ray flux of m 82 , consistent with the significant absorption that the observations indicate , and thus the dependence on the exact x - ray spectral shape is modest as far as the produced column densities are concerned .",
    "the considered densities and fluxes are representative of the conditions in m 82 in terms of pdrs , but only the models with @xmath27  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath5 should be typical of the x - ray background in m 82 .",
    "that is , a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath15 erg s@xmath7 yields @xmath28 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath5 for a point source at 50 pc from a molecular cloud .",
    "we also consider larger values for @xmath29 because the thermal x - ray emission is diffuse and molecular gas will enjoy a range of distances to ambient x - ray sources .",
    "for example , fuente et al .  (",
    "2006 ) adopt an emission size of @xmath30 for co@xmath0 , corresponding to a linear scale of about 100 pc at the distance to m 82 .",
    "imagine then that the interstellar medium of m 82 consists of a large number of @xmath31 1 - 10 pc clouds .",
    "if some of these clouds are at distances of about 1 pc to individual sources of x - ray radiation , then only about 1% of the total x - ray luminosity per source would already yield @xmath32 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath5 impinging on these clouds . at the same time",
    "can the covering factor of about a hundred of these clouds on the sky approach 5 - 50% , and thus contribute significantly to the xdr signal .",
    "figure [ columns ] shows the co@xmath0 column densities for a @xmath33  @xmath3 ( 10 pc cloud ) and a @xmath34  @xmath3 ( 1 pc cloud ) density range .",
    "when comparing the model results with the observations , one should realize that the observed co@xmath0 column densities are actually determined for gas densities around @xmath35 @xmath3 and a rotational excitation temperature of about 10 k ( fuente et al .  2003 ) .",
    "we also show lower density models in figure [ columns ] because the excitation of co@xmath0 is quite complicated ( black 1998 , stuber et al .",
    "we come back to this point in the discussion . in table 1 an overview is given of all the relevant chemical species and their ratios .",
    "it is obvious that xdrs allow columns of co@xmath0 that are comparable to the observed range of @xmath4 @xmath5 for modest densities , while @xmath35 @xmath3 gas requires a few clouds to be superposed along the line of sight , which seems very reasonable . from the abundances shown in figure [ pdrandxdr ] , where a comparison is made between a typical xdr and pdr model ,",
    "it is evident that the co@xmath0 abundance is more than an order of magnitude enhanced for the same total impinging flux by energy .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the more significant c@xmath0+oh@xmath36co@xmath0+h pathway in xdrs , where large amounts of c@xmath0 and oh co - exist to large depths ( meijerink & spaans 2005 ) .",
    "note in this that the endo - thermic o+h@xmath20@xmath36oh+h reaction is driven efficiently at the high ( @xmath37 k ) gas temperatures that pertain in xdrs even at large columns ( meijerink & spaans 2005 ) , augmented by the vibrational excitation of h@xmath20 .",
    "the xdr hoc@xmath0 abundances are also much larger than in pdrs and the model column densities are comparable to those of co@xmath0 , consistent with observations .",
    "the xdr hco@xmath0/hoc@xmath0 column density ratios are of the order of 20 - 40 when the total hydrogen column density is @xmath38 @xmath5 , also consistent with observations ( fuente et al .  2006 , their table 2 ) .",
    "similarly , figure [ pdrandxdr ] and table 1 show that for column densities exceeding @xmath39 @xmath5 the co@xmath0/hco@xmath0 column density ratio reaches values of 0.01 - 0.1 in xdrs , and is boosted relative to pdrs for the same ambient density and total impinging flux by energy .",
    "values of 0.01 - 0.1 can be reached for pdrs as well , but only if the columns are modest , @xmath40 @xmath5 .",
    "all this compares well with the 4.5 - 6.5 mag range for individual clumps in the fuente et al .  model .",
    "our adopted cosmic - ray ionization rate is @xmath41 comparable to the fuente et al .  value .",
    "we find ( see also meijerink et al .  2006 ) that a boost in the formation of co@xmath0 through an enhanced cosmic ray ionization rate does not occur because direct ionization of co is negligible and the c@xmath0 abundance is simply too small beyond the radical region in pdrs to react with oh .    finally , in their model fuente et al .",
    "( 2006 ) require about 20 - 40 pdr clumps of @xmath42 @xmath3 density and 7 mag extinction in order to reproduce the observed cn column of @xmath43 @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ pdrandxdr ] shows that xdrs with low impinging x - ray fluxes do not exhibit strongly enhanced cn abundances ( with large @xmath29 they would ) , but have abundances similar to or somewhat smaller than pdrs .",
    "table 1 shows that our pdr model with @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath3 produces a cn column of a few @xmath46 @xmath5 , and requires several clumps along the line of sight , consistent with the co@xmath0 requirement at that density .",
    "the impinging fuv flux of this pdr model is a factor of 10 below the best fit model of fuente et al .",
    ". the pdr cn / hcn column density ratios of about 4 - 7 are also consistent with observations ( fuente et al .",
    "2006 , their table 2 ) .",
    "the xdr cn / hcn column density ratios are about 80 - 180 .",
    "however , the hcn abundance in an xdr is not strongly boosted at all for low @xmath29 ( see also lepp & dalgarno 1996 , their figure 3 ) . consequently , the pdr contribution will dominate the observed hcn ( as well as cn ) signal and no inconsistency arises .",
    "our models do not experience the bi - stability effect , where a low and a high ionization phase co - exist through the interplay of h@xmath47 , s@xmath0 and o@xmath20 ( e.g.  boger & sternberg 2006 ) , because gas - grain neutralization is rapid .",
    "the co@xmath0 abundance in x - ray irradiated interstellar gas is boosted , relative to the fuv irradiation case .",
    "the star - burst galaxy m 82 appears to need only a modest flux of x - rays , consistent with observations , in order to reproduce the observed co@xmath0 column across its nuclear disk at a density of @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "we conjecture that other star - burst galaxies may experience similar effects .",
    "the metallicity in the central regions of m 82 is poorly known .",
    "read & stevens ( 2002 ) find super - solar abundances for mg and si , but near - solar values for n , o and fe ) .",
    "for comparison we have run models with solar metallicity and the same density and irradiation conditions .",
    "it turns out that solar metallicity lowers the abundance of co@xmath0 by about a factor of two to three for columns less than a few times @xmath48 @xmath5 , while the difference is no more than @xmath49% for columns larger than a few times @xmath48 @xmath5 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that a lower metallicity causes a lower absorption rate of x - rays and thus a larger total column of material is needed to build up the same column of ionization driven species like co+ . since the bulk of the m 82 x - rays is absorbed in our model , i.e.we have total hydrogen columns of more than @xmath50 @xmath5 ( a few clumps ) , the impact of metallicity variations is modest .",
    "specifically , for solar metallcity and a total hydrogen column density of @xmath51 @xmath5 ( @xmath52 clumps ) or @xmath53 @xmath5 ( @xmath54 clumps ) we find co@xmath0 columns of @xmath55 @xmath5 ( a factor 2.7 lower ) or @xmath56 @xmath5 ( a factor 1.5 lower ) , respectively .",
    "it would be quite useful to have h , h@xmath20 and electron collisional rate coefficients for co@xmath0 .",
    "still , the situation for co@xmath0 is quite special in that it is a ` transient ' molecule ( black 1998 ) , for which the destruction time is shorter than the time to reach collisional equilibrium . as a consequence ,",
    "the excited state that the formation process leaves the co@xmath0 molecule in , should be an integral part of the excitation analysis because inelastic collisions with h@xmath20 may not be able to thermalize the co@xmath0 levels .",
    "indeed , if co@xmath0 is formed in an excited state , then a low density , @xmath33 @xmath3 , gas component as shown in figure [ columns ] and table 1 can already lead to large co@xmath0 emissivities because co@xmath0 column densities increase with @xmath57 .",
