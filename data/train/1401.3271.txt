    "recently , organic photovoltaics have attracted a great deal of attention , as they have the potential of harvesting solar light cheaply and easilychemrev1 . for this purpose",
    "a lot of scientific effort has been devoted to simulating some of the fundamental steps occurring in natural photosynthesis , one of the most important being the photoinduced charge separation@xcite .",
    "thus , the scientific community adopted as one of its major tasks to develop methods that can reliably and inexpensively describe charge - transfer ( ct ) excitations , where light absorption causes a charge transfer from a donor to an acceptor .",
    "the donor - acceptor system consists of either two or more different molecules that interact weakly or of two sites of the same big molecule . in this work",
    "we shall deal only with the first class of donor - acceptor complexes .    although time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft)@xcite is currently successfully applied for the description of excitations of large molecular systems , charge - transfer excitations in the linear response regime with standard frequency - independent exchange - correlation kernels exhibit significant failures , giving underestimations of several ev @xcite .",
    "this failure is attributed to the wrong asymtotic shape of the ground - state exchange correlation ( xc ) potential , which leads to errors in the orbital energies@xcite . moreover , the kohn - sham orbital overlaps of the donor@xmath0acceptor system that enter the exchange - correlation part of the dyson equation vanish when non - hybrid xc kernels are used . consequently , the charge - transfer energy is given as the orbital energy difference@xcite .",
    "currently , there is a lot of effort on the development of exchange correlation kernels that mitigate this deficiency@xcite . using range - separated hybrid functionals tawada , stein , where the exchange functional is split in two terms , a short - range term that is represented by a local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) potential and a long - range term that is treated via exact exchange ,",
    "improve the results obtained by tddft for charge - transfer excitations . in this case one",
    "has to determine the range - splitting parameter .",
    "this is done either empirically by fitting to a set of data lange or by introducing a system dependent parameter by tuning the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) close to minus the ionization potential@xcite .",
    "a time - independent variational approach of density functional theory ( dft ) , that is not based on response theory , termed as relaxed constrained - variational dft , gives promising results on charge - transfer excitations@xcite . in this case",
    ", the charge constraint is imposed on a region of the orbital space .",
    "there is also a constrained - variational dft scheme where the charge is constrained in real space @xcite .",
    "recently , a perturbative - delta self consistent field ( @xmath1scf)@xcite approach has been developed , where a non - aufbau occupation of the density during a normal self consistent field optimization is enforced as in traditional @xmath1scf@xcite , which in combination with perturbation theory , gives for the systems tested a good description of excitations in donor - acceptor complexes .",
    "recently , a variational approach was introduced , based on solving the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf)@xcite eigenvalue equations in different subspaces spanned by the occupied and virtual ground state orbitalsour1 . in this approach ,",
    "an excited state was considered with a hole in the subspace of the occupied orbitals and a particle in the subspace of virtual orbitals , where both were determined variationally .",
    "conceptually , this scheme is close to the @xmath1scf one , however within this scheme there is no possibility of a variational collapse to the ground state , as it may happen in @xmath1scf , since the state defined in this way , is always orthogonal to the ground state .",
    "the orthogonality of approximate excited states to the ground state is desirable since the exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian also have this property . in a recent paper an extension of this approach",
    "was given which includes double excitations@xcite .",
    "in the current work , in order to study an excitation where an electron is transferred from a donor system to an acceptor one , it is necessary to take into account not only orthogonality , but also the localization of the orbitals in the donor and acceptor regions , with some overlap in the intermediate region . for this purpose",
    "we create four subspaces : one that belongs to the occupied orbitals that are localized mostly in the donor region and a similar one consisting of the virtual ones .",
    "a third set consists of the occupied orbitals localized in the neighborhood of the acceptor and a fourth set is spanned by the virtual orbitals of the acceptor .",
    "see fig.([figure_subspaces ] ) for an example where the donor side contains three occupied orbitals and four unoccupied ones in the respective subspaces , and the acceptor side provides two occupied and five unoccupied orbitals .",
    "next , we describe the ct excited state by a slater determinant with a hole in the donor occupied subspace and a particle in the acceptor virtual subspace .",
    "both , the particle and the hole , are determined variationally by minimizing the hartree fock functional . in this way we are able to calculate intermolecular charge - transfer excitations .",
    "more details are given in the next section .",
    "we applied our scheme to a series of tetracyanoethylene ( tcne)-various donors systems that have been used before @xcite and found that our results compare well with the experimental ones .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we explain the main idea of our approach and give the equations used for its realization . in section iii",
    "we examine the performance of this scheme in obtaining charge - transfer excitation energies and we show that at least for the system tested , it can provide a good description . finally , in section iv we give our concluding remarks .",
    "( occupied orbitals of the donor ) , @xmath2 ( occupied orbitals of the acceptor ) , @xmath3 ( virtual orbitals of the donor ) and @xmath4 ( virtual orbitals of the acceptor ) .",
    "note that in practice we perform the subspace decomposition only for the up orbitals and the down electrons are just given here to complete the picture.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "let us consider an excitation of one electron from the donor to the acceptor .",
    "we assume that the excited electron is a spin up one and for simplifying our notation we shall omit the spin index when we refer to spin up .",
    "all the orbitals derived from the hartree - fock ground state calculation , which will be denoted by @xmath5 , are used to build two orthogonal subspaces , @xmath6 consisting of the orbitals @xmath7 that are localized mostly in the donor and @xmath8 of orbitals similarly localized mostly in the acceptor system @xmath9 .",
    "this classification is performed by summing for each orbital @xmath10 , its projections on the gaussians centered at the donor or correspondingly at the acceptor .",
    "thus , in order to check whether the orbital @xmath11 is more localized in the area of the donor or the acceptor , we calculate the sum of the overlaps @xmath12 centered in the donor or the acceptor system .",
    "then , depending on which sum is larger , we attribute the orbital @xmath13 to the donor or the acceptor subspace . when donor and acceptor are not molecules of the same type an orbital can not have exactly equal projections on both the donor and the acceptor .",
    "next , we further separate @xmath14 into a subspace @xmath15 spanned by the occupied orbitals \\{@xmath16 and @xmath3 of  the virtual ones @xmath17 .",
    "similarly @xmath8 consists of @xmath2 spanned @xmath18 and @xmath4 of the virtuals of the acceptor @xmath19 .",
    "the subspace dimensions are denoted by @xmath20 for @xmath6 @xmath21 for @xmath15 and correspondingly by @xmath22 @xmath23 for the acceptor .",
    "the charge - transfer excited state orbitals that are localized in the donor system are denoted by @xmath24 and the ones that are localized in the acceptor by @xmath25 .",
    "then , we demand that the excited state @xmath26 has one more electron in @xmath4 than the ground state hf and one hole in @xmath15 .",
    "thus , in addition to the normalization of the orbitals the following conditions should be satisfied : i ) @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29ii ) @xmath30 , for @xmath28 and @xmath31the two relations above imply that the excited orbitals @xmath32 belong to the subspace @xmath15.iii ) @xmath33 , for @xmath34 iv)@xmath35 , for @xmath36relations ( iii ) and ( iv ) imply that @xmath37 comprises one orbital named @xmath38 that belongs to @xmath4.v ) @xmath39 , for @xmath40 and for @xmath41 and vi)@xmath42 , for @xmath40 and for j=1, .. ,@xmath43relations ( v ) and ( vi ) imply that the excited orbitals @xmath44 belong to @xmath2 . minimizing the energy functional @xmath45 under the above conditions , taking also into account the orbital normalization , one gets the following set of one particle equations :    @xmath46 as usual , the fock operator @xmath47 corresponding to @xmath48 is defined by the following equation @xmath49where @xmath50 is the kinetic plus external potential operator , which is the same as the one of the uhf ground state and @xmath51 is the spin density matrix of @xmath37 : @xmath52where @xmath53 stands for the number of occupied orbitals with @xmath54 @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "finally , @xmath57 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath58 to show that @xmath59 maps a function and not its value to another function in order to account for the nonlocal operator .",
    "the sums @xmath60 and @xmath61 are projection operators onto the subspaces @xmath62 and @xmath8 respectively , which act as identity operators in the corresponding subspaces . for the excited orbitals of the acceptor",
    "we obtain : @xmath63 and @xmath64the first sum that appears in eqs.([acceptor1 ] ) , ( [ acceptor2 ] ) corresponds to the projection operator in @xmath14 and the second sum to projections in @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "then the left hand side of eq.([donor ] ) can be identified as the projection of the fock operator onto the subspace of the occupied orbitals of the donor , eq.([acceptor1 ] ) as the projection of the fock operator in the virtual orbitals of the acceptor and eq.([acceptor2 ] ) as the projection of the fock operator in the occupied orbitals of the acceptor .",
    "note that we need no equation for obtaining orbitals that belong to @xmath65 since these orbitals do not enter our @xmath66 state .",
    "the equation for the spin down orbitals has the usual uhf form@xcite i.e. @xmath67 since no constraints are imposed beyond that of normalization .",
    "note , however , that these orbitals are not identical to those of the uhf ground state since the hartree term changes because it includes the density of the spin up particles .",
    "since we assumed that the electron which gives the charge - transfer excited state is an up electron , the fock matrices in eqs.(donor),([acceptor1]),([acceptor2 ] ) are fock matrices of spin up electrons .    as mentioned earlier , the left hand side of eqs.([donor ] ) , ( acceptor1 ) , ( [ acceptor2 ] ) is nothing more than the projection of the fock matrices in the subspaces @xmath15 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 respectively , forcing our one electron eigenvalue equations to have solutions that belong to these subspaces , making it possible to avoid the use of lagrange multipliers .",
    "this is achieved by constructing the fock matrices in the basis of the ground state hf orbitals that span the corresponding subspaces . for more details",
    "see appendix b of our2 .",
    "once we manage to restrict the fock operator in the subspaces @xmath68 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 , eqs.([donor]),(acceptor1),([acceptor2 ] ) assume the following simple form : @xmath69from the @xmath70 lowest energy solutions of eq.([eq : eigenstate donor ] ) , the lowest energy solutions of eq.([eq : eigenstate acceptor1 ] ) and all the solutions of eq.([eq : eigenstate acceptor2 ] ) we can find the @xmath71 @xmath24 , the @xmath72 and the @xmath73 orbitals of @xmath37 .",
    "thus , one has to self consistently solve the system of eqs.(eq : eigenstate donor),([eq : eigenstate acceptor1]),([eq : eigenstate acceptor2 ] ) together with the equation for the down orbitals , eq.([down ] ) .",
    "the determinant @xmath37 that corresponds to the approximate eigenstate of the excited charge - transfer state will be orthogonal to the ground state one , i.e. @xmath74 .",
    "this is true since the highest occupied orbital of the acceptor in @xmath75 belongs to @xmath4 , thus this orbital by construction has zero overlap with",
    "all the ground state occupied orbitals .",
    "the next step is to express the fock operators that appear in the eigenvalue equations as matrices in some basis set to do the appropriate numerical calculations .",
    "since any basis set we use to do this expansion will lead to an eigenvalue problem giving the same results ( as long as the basis is complete ) , we can use the ground state orbitals that span the subspaces @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 to express the fock matrices of equations ( [ eq : eigenstate donor ] ) , ( [ eq : eigenstate acceptor1 ] ) , ( eq : eigenstate acceptor2 ) .",
    "@xmath79@xmath80@xmath81the equations above are the ones that we solve in order to obtain @xmath66 .",
    "it is worth to note that one could also treat charge - transfer excitations where more than one electrons are transferred from the donor to the acceptor system .",
    "the only difference in the treatment is to introduce two or more excited state orbitals in @xmath4 and to create two or more holes respectively in the subspace of @xmath15 .",
    "we stress the fact that all orbitals that contribute to @xmath48 are obtained by one electron eigenvalue equations where they are `` repelled '' correctly by an electrostatic charge of @xmath82 electrons .",
    "this is in contrast to hf virtual orbitals which are artificially diffuse as they are repelled by @xmath83 electrons .",
    "consequently , occupying the hf virtual orbitals without further minimization , as it is well known , leads to large excitation energies .",
    "the approach developed in section ii was used to calculate the charge - transfer excitation energies of a test set of various aromatic donor - tcne complexes and anthracene substituted derivatives - tcne , for which experimental results are available .",
    "this test set was introduced by stein et al .",
    "@xcite to examine the performance of their dual - range functional in charge - transfer excitations .",
    "thereafter , it has been used as a standard set by other authors to validate their approaches in this kind of excitations @xcite .",
    "for all the donor - tcne results obtained by using the approach presented in this work , the 6 - 31 g * basis set was adopted .",
    "the geometries used were the b3lyp - optimized ones and were taken from stein et al@xcite .",
    ".charge transfer excitation energies ( ev ) for @xmath84 donor to @xmath85 ( tcne ) transitions in donor - tcne complexes in gas phase [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tbl1 ] , we present the gas phase excitation energies from various aromatic donors to tcne . for comparison , we also give the experimental values of these excitations and the results obtained by applying tddft - b3lyp , tddft dual - range bnl @xmath86 taken from reference @xcite and @xmath1scf - hf .",
    "@xmath1scf - hf results are obtained by starting with the uhf orbitals of the ground - state as initial guess and then solving the uhf equations using a scf procedure in which the lowest @xmath87 - 1 orbitals and the @xmath88 are occupied in each update of the density .",
    "as one can see , all the tddft - b3lyp results for these systems underestimate the experimentally measured excitation energies by about 1.5 ev , @xmath1scf - hf results are better but still underestimate the energy by 0.4 - 0.6 ev , whereas those of the present approach are in good agreement with experiment and those obtained by tddft - bnl @xmath89 .    in table",
    "[ tbl2 ] we give the results obtained for anthracene substituted derivatives - tcne in methylene chloride solution . as no solvation model was used , 0.32 ev were substracted from every calculated gas phase value , following the suggestion by stein et al@xcite .",
    "thus all the calculated results that appear in table [ tbl2 ] are the calculated values minus 0.32 ev to account for the solvent effect . for comparison",
    "we give the tddft - pbe , tddft - b3lyp , tddft dual - range bnl @xmath86 and the experimental results for these excitations .",
    "the tddft - pbe and tddft - b3lyp results are not only too low , but also the descending order relation of the various donor - acceptor excitations is violated .",
    "the descending order relation is also violated by @xmath90scf - hf results .",
    "our results keep the descending order , are close to tddft - bnl@xmath86 and compare well to experiment .    as expected from the self - interction problem of virtual hf orbitals , replacing in the ground state slater determinant the homo of the donor with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the acceptor and calculating the energy difference from the ground state hf energies gave more than 1ev overestimation of the ct energies for all the systems tested .",

    "apart from the energies calculated from the approach presented here , we give for comparison the fit of these values to a 1/r curve , the curve that one gets from mulliken s rule as well as the tddft - b3lyp curve with its own 1/r fitted curve.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.35 . apart from the energies calculated from the approach presented here , we give for comparison the fit of these values to a 1/r curve , the curve that one gets from mulliken s rule as well as the tddft - b3lyp curve with its own 1/r fitted curve.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the charge - transfer excitations at large intermolecular distances follow the mulliken s rule@xcite which states that the lower photon energy @xmath93 required to induce an electron transfer between a donor - acceptor system in asymptotically large intermolecular distances @xmath94 is : @xmath95where @xmath96 is the ionization potential of the donor and @xmath97 is the electron affinity of the acceptor . to check whether the energy grows asymptotically with 1/r",
    ", we studied the lowest charge - transfer energy of the two systems c@xmath92h@xmath91-c@xmath92f@xmath91 and c@xmath92h@xmath91-ne at different large intermolecular distances @xmath94 ( see fig.[figure_structures ] ) and we present the results in fig.[figure1 ] . for comparison , we plot the curve we get from mulliken s law , the fitted curve to our points where energy grows with 1/r and the curve derived from tddft - b3lyp with its 1/r fit . for both complexes",
    "the aug - cc - pvdz basis set was used for all the energy calculations .",
    "although in both cases , our results are below the ones from mulliken s rule , they satisfy the 1/r behavior contrary to the tddft - b3lyp results that apart from being too low in energy are almost constant with @xmath94 .",
    "for all the calculations with our minimization scheme we used the ground state hf orbitals that correspond to the @xmath78 subspace instead of solving the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eigenstate acceptor2 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that optimizing this set of orbitals gave only a minor change to the total energy , much smaller than the accuracy of our results .",
    "nevertheless , we can not claim that one can always omit solving this equation , although it is expected that in this subspace the changes with respect to the ground state orbitals are smaller than in the other two , @xmath98 and @xmath15 , where the particle and the hole are located .    for all of our calculations we used basis sets with diffuse functions .",
    "those functions are particularly important when the donor and acceptor subsystems are not close to each other to ensure that one treats two weakly interacting systems and not two isolated ones .",
    "all the ground state and the tddft - b3lyp calculations for the c@xmath92h@xmath91-ne c@xmath92h@xmath91-c@xmath92f@xmath91 systems were carried out using gamess us @xcite and a code was developed for our approach . for the visualization of the structures",
    "the xcrysden program was used @xcite .",
    "in this work we extend our hf excited state subsequent minimization scheme developed recently to describe charge - transfer excitations .",
    "this is achieved by creating a particle - hole pair excited state , which is always orthogonal to the ground state and both the particle and the hole are determined variationally .",
    "this is done by separating the ground state hf orbitals into two sets : one mostly localized at the donor and the other at the acceptor .",
    "each such set is further separated in subspaces of occupied and virtual orbitals .",
    "thus , we have four subspaces and the hf energy functional is minimized in each subspace separately . in this way variational collapse and self - interaction are avoided .",
    "we tested the approach on a standard set of pairs of molecules and found that our theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones and show the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the computational cost of this scheme is the same as the one of a hf ground state calculation .",
    "finally , one could easily calculate double or multiple excitations within this approach as the only difference is that one would need to create more than one particle - hole pair in the appropriate subspaces .",
