    "the pomeron being an infinite gluon ladder @xcite-@xcite may appear as a finite sum of gluon ladders corresponding to a finite sum of regge multipoles with increasing multiplicities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the first term in @xmath3 series contributes to the total cross - section with a constant term and can be associated with a simple pole , the second one ( double pole ) goes as @xmath3 , the third one ( triple pole ) as @xmath4 , etc .",
    "all pomeron poles have unit intercept .",
    "previously the multipole pomeron and many - pomerons approaches were investigated on different applications @xcite-@xcite ( see also review @xcite ) . due to the recent experiments on elastic and inelastic proton - proton scattering by the totem collaboration at the lhc @xcite , data in a wide range , from lowest up to tev energies , both for proton - proton and antiproton - proton scattering in a wide span of transferred momenta are now available .",
    "the experiments at tev energies give a chance to verify different pomeron and odderon models because the secondary reggeon contributions at these energies are small .",
    "note that none of the existing models of elastic scattering was able to predict the value of the differential cross section beyond the first cone , as clearly seen in fig.4 of the totem paper @xcite .",
    "this problem is still remains actual and inspired some people to construct the new and revitalize a well - known old fashioned models .",
    "consequently for this time it is necessary to revise our concept on exchange mechanism in this distant region of energies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a number of models have been refined and developed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , several of used pomeron models , as a rule , have intercept @xmath5 which requires the unitarisation @xcite , other ones have complicated structure and the overall number of parameters was fairly high @xcite .    here",
    "we suggest the three - component pomeron model inspired by the finite sum of gluon ladders extended to the whole range of available momentum transfer of high - energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic scattering and performed a simultaneous fit to the @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 data . our goal is to investigate the capabilities of pomeron model as a finite sum of gluon rungs ( @xmath3 power ) equivalent to single pole + dipole + tripole pomeron with sufficiently account the spin influence and non - linear trajectory for @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering in first and second diffraction cone .",
    "our strategy is two fold : one to select a core set of experimental data , as well as models of reference , most appropriately describing the details of this basic set .",
    "first we take the set @xcite , and then - the paper @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "one introduces the main formulas and features of the model . in sec . 3 , we perform the comparison with experiment . in the last section ,",
    "the conclusions are drawn up .",
    "the reduced form of nucleon - nucleon amplitude without double spin - flip accounting is @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is spin - nonflip component and @xmath10 is spin - flip component of scattering amplitude .",
    "our ansatz for the spin - nonflip scattering amplitude component @xmath11 is : @xmath12\\ ] ] for @xmath13 ( upper symbol ) and @xmath14 ( lower symbol ) scattering respectively . for the spin - flip scattering amplitude component @xmath15 @xmath16.\\ ] ] we suppose that the contribution of the subleading reggeons to the spin - flip amplitude is the same as to the spin - nonflip amplitude and the contribution of odderon to the spin - flip amplitude differ from one to the spin - nonflip amplitude by the factor @xmath17 , where the pomeron contribution we introduce in form : @xmath18 and @xmath19    the pomeron trajectory is : @xmath20    where the lowest two - pion threshold @xmath21 .",
    "the residue functions are :    @xmath22    @xmath23    in ( 2),(3 ) the @xmath24 and @xmath25 contain the subleading reggeons as well as the odderon contributions to the scattering amplitude : @xmath26 and @xmath27    where @xmath28 to describe the different behavior of proton - proton and antiproton - proton differential cross - section in region of dip - bump one needs to include the odderon contribution , which we use in a simple form :    @xmath29    the odderon trajectory is    @xmath30    the residue functions are : @xmath31    @xmath32 .",

    "in order to determine the parameters that control the @xmath33-dependence of @xmath35 we applied a wide energy range @xmath36 and used the available data for total cross sections and @xmath2 ( @xcite ) . a total of @xmath37 experimental points were included for @xmath38 .",
    "for the differential cross sections we selected the data at the energies @xmath39 ( for @xmath0scattering)(1633 experimental points ) and @xmath40=31;53;62;546;1800@xmath41 ( 510 experimental points ) for @xmath1 scattering @xcite .",
    "the squared 4-momentum covers entire available range @xmath42 .",

    "we conclude that the multipole pomeron model corresponding to a sum of gluon ladders up to two rungs complicated with odderon contribution and spin counting fits the data well in a wide energy and momentum transfer regions . in this paper",
    ", we have explored only the simplest phenomenological tripole pomeron .",
    "in fact , the scattering amplitude is much more complicated than just a simple power series in @xmath3 . on the one hand , although we used just a simplified @xmath34-dependence in the model , reasonably good results were obtained . because the slopes of secondary reggeons do not influence the fit sufficiently ,",
    "we have fixed them at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which correspond to the values of chew - frautschi plot , as well as its slope parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "additionally we fixed the pomeron trajectory slope @xmath50 . on the other hand",
    ", we included the curvature of the pomeron trajectory that can not be negligible .",
    "the quality of our fits @xmath51=1.56 is comparable with that of the best fit of @xcite .",
    "we have approved the tripole pomeron model having each term corresponding to a finite gluon ladder .",
    "this corresponds to the finite sum of gluon ladders with up to two rungs or alternatively up to the tripole pomeron contribution .",
    "we have obtained very good description of @xmath52 and @xmath13 hadron scattering data at intermediate and high energies and all available momentum transfer .",
    "we conclude that the nonfactorisable form of the pomeron and odderon amplitudes as well as the nonlinearity of its trajectory and the residue function is strongly suggested by data at all available momentum transfer .",
    "it should be noted that the addition of spin - flip component of scattering amlitude decisively improves the result of the fit .",
