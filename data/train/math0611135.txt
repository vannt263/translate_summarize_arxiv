    "let @xmath0 be a number field . by a well - known result there exists a dessin denfant ( cover of the projective line unramified outside three points ) having @xmath0 as field of moduli .",

    "the present note is an invitation to the study of this invariant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in the first section , we give some general results concerning the belyi degree , as for example the fact that there exist finitely many number fields of bounded ( belyi ) degree .    in  2 , we obtain a lower bound for such an invariant ( theorem 4 ) , which follows from a result of s. beckmannn concerning the ramified primes in the field of moduli of a cover of the projective line defined over a number field .",
    "although this bound seems rough , it can be shown that it is optimal. indeed , in  4 we prove that it is reached for infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields .",
    "in  3 we use a construction of r. licanu and a result of d. roy and j. l. thunder in order to obtain an upper bound of the belyi degree ( theorem 7 ) , only depending on the degree and on the ( absolute value ) of the discriminant of the number field .",
    "more precisely , we prove that once we have fixed the degree , the growth of the belyi degree is at most polynomial on the discriminant .",
    "this leads to the introduction of the minimal discriminant exponent .    in  4 , which is a computational approach to the belyi degree of quadratic fields",
    ", we obtain an upper bound which is linear on the discriminant and in some cases , we are also able to completely determine this invariant . as a consequence",
    "we prove that the minimal discriminant exponent is equal to @xmath1 for these fields .",
    "we also include two appendices : in the first we generalize two results of h. w. lenstra which are very useful when studying the field of moduli of a genus @xmath2 dessin denfant ; in the second we give the explicit equations for the dessins denfants introduced in  4 .",
    "even if it is a well - known fact ( see for example  @xcite , or more generally  @xcite for an introduction to dessins denfants ) we start this section by proving that any number field appears as the field of moduli of a dessin denfant .",
