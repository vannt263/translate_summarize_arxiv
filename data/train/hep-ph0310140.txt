    "there have been a number of calculations  @xcite using light - front coordinates  @xcite as a convenient means of attacking field - theoretic problems nonperturbatively , particularly in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "efforts in more dimensions have generally been less successful , however , due to the need for regularization and renormalization . here two approaches that include consistent regularization",
    "are briefly reviewed in the context of specific model calculations  @xcite .",
    "one approach is pauli  villars ( pv ) regularization  @xcite , where massive negative - metric particles are added to a theory to provide the necessary cancellations  @xcite .",
    "the other is supersymmetry  @xcite . these are not the only approaches available on the light front ; in particular , one can find the transverse lattice technique  @xcite and similarity transformations  @xcite discussed elsewhere in this volume .",
    "the primary numerical method is discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite , in which one imposes a discrete momentum grid , with length scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and approximates integrals in the mass - squared eigenvalue problem with trapezoidal sums .",
    "the continuum limit @xmath4 can be exchanged for a limit in terms of the integer resolution @xmath5 , because light - cone momentum fractions @xmath6 are measured in units of @xmath7 .    for supersymmetric theories",
    "there is a supersymmetric version of dlcq ( sdlcq ) that preserves supersymmetry within the discrete approximation  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by discretizing the supercharge @xmath8 and constructing the hamiltonian @xmath9 from the superalgebra via the anticommutator : @xmath10 .",
    "this @xmath9 and the dlcq @xmath9 are equivalent in the @xmath11 limit .",
    "the matrix eigenvalue problems that result from these discretizations are large but sparse .",
    "an efficient means for extracting a few lowest eigenvalues and their eigenvectors is the lanczos algorithm  @xcite . in the case of pv - regulated theories , with their indefinite metrics , a special form  @xcite based on the biorthogonal algorithm  @xcite is required . in either case , the process is an iterative one that generates a tridiagonal matrix of much smaller size , which is easily diagonalized to yield approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the number of iterations and the size of the tridiagonal matrix are determined by the rate of convergence .",
    "the primary difficulty that arises is that round - off error causes spurious copies to appear in the derived spectrum ; however , there are techniques for removing them  @xcite .    in the remaining sections we discuss an application of pv regularization to yukawa theory and a study of supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) with a chern  simons ( cs ) term in the large-@xmath12 approximation .",

    "@xcite contains many subsequent results .    for a two - boson truncation , the solution is no longer analytic , but the coupled equations can be reduced to eight equations for the two - particle amplitudes only , which are of the form + & & + _ abs_0 ^ 1dydq_^2 j_ijs , abs^(0)(y , q_;y,q_)f_abs(y,q _ ) + & & + _",

    "although one could impose a transverse cutoff and discretize these equations as per dlcq , alternative quadratures are more efficient .",
    "in particular , the transverse momentum @xmath29 can be mapped to a finite range that compresses the wave function s tail to a relatively small region , so that a gauss  legendre quadrature can yield a good approximation .",
