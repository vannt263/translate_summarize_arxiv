    "the former is needed to separate ( anti-)quarks with opposite electric charges by a distance larger than nucleon size .",
    "the restored chiral symmetry is required because charge separation is possible at conserved chirality only .",
    "therefore the investigation of energy dependence of @xmath4 via definition of convenient parameters and analysis of its corresponding dependence is important challenge for study of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions and search for transition domain from prevalence of hadronic states to domination of deconfinement phase of quarks and gluons .",
    "at present the gauge - string duality seems one of the most powerful and promising tools for study of various aspects of heavy ion collisions in strong coupling regime @xcite .",
