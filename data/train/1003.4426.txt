    "massive star formation is poorly understood as compared to low - mass stars , because their formation takes place in the dense core of a molecular cloud of high visual extinction , usually observable at far - infrared ( fir ) to millimeter wavelengths and their evolutionary time scales are much shorter ( @xmath6 10@xmath7 yr ) ( e.g. , bernasconi & maeder 1996 ) .",
    "the radio free - free emission in terms of ultracompact ( ) regions , represents a later evolutionary sequence of a massive protostar outlined by beuther et al .",

    "the region can further evolve into the less obscure stage of compact ( ) and classical regions ( garay & lizano 1999 ) by the disruption of associated gas and dust , revealing both , the embedded high - mass and lower mass stellar population at shorter wavelengths .",
    "most of the high - mass star - forming regions in the galaxy lie at a distance of more than 1 kpc . as a result",
    ", the problem in interpreting observations of massive star formation originates in source confusion at the core of distant molecular clouds due to their cluster mode formation .",
    "statistically , it has been shown that the most luminous protostars form in molecular clouds associated with evolved regions ( dobashi et al .",
    "2001 ) , where the interplay between the stars radiation field and associated gas and dust makes the environment even more complex .",
    "therefore , a detailed study of the star - forming region hosting young massive stars , using optical , near - infrared ( nir ) , mid - infrared ( mir ) and radio bands , is necessary to understand the high - mass star formation scenario in these complexes .    in this paper",

    "we have adopted a widely used value of distance of @xmath0 8.7 kpc for our analysis .",

    "sh 2 - 100 is itself a part of the large molecular cloud complex w58 , which consists of several classes of regions with widely varying physical parameters .",

    "a faint nebulosity is also seen @xmath0 15.5@xmath11 away in the southern direction of k3 - 50c2 , whereas k3 - 50a appears as a stellar point - like source and is marked with a circle .",
    "the regions k3 - 50b and k3 - 50c1 are optically invisible radio sources , implying that the extinction is high enough to obscure the regions . by comparing the expected infrared br@xmath12 line fluxes as predicted from radio continuum fluxes , to the observed br@xmath12 line fluxes , roelfsema et al .",

    "observations at radio wavelengths suggest that these regions harbor at least one massive ob star ( harris 1975 ; israel 1976 ; depree et al .",

    "the regions k3 - 50a and k3 - 50c ( consisting of two sources c1 and c2 ) are possibly younger than k3 - 50b , due to their association with intense @xmath124co(1 - 0 ) emission , compact radio sizes and the ionzing sources possess infrared excess ( e.g. , c2 and a ) . the detection of oh masers ( baudry & desmurs 2002 ) and ionized outflows ( depree et al . 1994 ; balser et al .",
    "2001 ) in both the cores indicate that they are not dynamically evolved objects and suggest that the star formation activity around k3 - 50c and k3 - 50a should not be more than @xmath0 few @xmath2 10@xmath131 yr .",
    "the component c1 is hidden behind a visual extinction @xmath68 190 mag , therefore invisible in wavelength shorter than 20 @xmath1 m , whereas the ionizing source of k3 - 50a is detected in nir and embedded in molecular cloud having visual extinction @xmath0 17.5 mag .",
    "k3 - 50c1 has lower dust temperature than k3 - 50a , possibly indicating that k3 - 50c1 is more deeply embedded in the molecular cloud as compared to k3 - 50a ( hunter et al .",
    "the above discussion reveals that k3 - 50c1 is most likely the youngest source of the region .",
    "w58 is a molecular cloud complex of an angular extent of about 60 arcmin .",
    "the @xmath124co distribution mainly reveals three distinct components ( see fig.3 of israel 1980 ) and the associated sfrs to these components are k3 - 50 , sh 2 - 99 ( s99 ) and w58 g . fig .",
    "23 shows 8 @xmath1 m emission from msx a - band along with the distribution of emission around the sfr complex ( thick solid line ) taken from fig .",
    "6 of israel ( 1980 ) .",
    "the positions of different sources found towards the direction of w58 cloud complex are shown as crosses . the most intense northern co component associated with k3 - 50 sfr peaks close to k3 - 50c , where most of the star formation activity is currently going on .",
    "the western co component is associated with an optically visible region ( sh 2 - 99/g70.15 + 1.73 ) situated at a distance of @xmath0 11@xmath10 from k3 - 50a towards the south - western direction .",
    "the weaker southern co component is associated with an region ( w58g / g69.92 + 1.52 ) which is @xmath0 23@xmath10 away from k3 - 50a . in the case of region",
    "( w58 g ) , a radial velocity of -65 km s@xmath16 has been measured , which differs significantly from the radial velocity - 22 to -25 km s@xmath16 found in the direction of w58 .",
    "this indicates that w58 g most likely is not related to w58 cloud complex ( israel 1980 and references therein ) , whereas the radial velocity of -22.9 km s@xmath16 for sh 2 - 99 ( blair et al . 1975 ) suggests its association with w58 . with the help of emission observed by read ( 1981 ) with a resolution of 2@xmath10.5 @xmath2 4@xmath10.6 , israel ( 1980 ) pointed out an /expanding shell of diameter @xmath0 75 pc and suggested that the current star formation activity in sh 2 - 99 and k3 - 50 region might have been induced by the interaction of this shell produced by stellar winds from the older generation stars of w58 cloud complex . to recognize such a shell ,",
    "a potential way is to use the pah emissions at 8 @xmath1 m arising from the photodissociation region , which occurs at the interface between the molecular and neutral gas and thought to be excited by sub - lyman uv photons from the massive star(s ) .",
    "consequently , it can be used as a tracer of the neutral shell observed in the 21-cm line emission at the edge of expanding region ( deharveng et al . 2005 ) .",
    "23 shows the 8 @xmath1 m pah emission surrounding the bubble noticed by israel ( 1980 ) and roughly coincides with the emission in terms of discrete patches .",
    "the absence of 8 @xmath1 m emission in the interior of the shell can be interpreted as the destruction of pah molecules by intense uv radiation from the associated massive star(s ) .",
    "the shape and large dimension of shell suggest that the stars producing stellar wind should be located inside the shell . a search of _ simbad _ database results in a wr star ( wr 131 ) of wn7h ( hydrogen rich ) subtype ( figer et al .",
    "1997 ) , whose position is marked in fig .",
    "the hydrogen rich wn7 stars are descendants of massive stars with initial masses above 50 - 60 @xmath130 ( e.g. , crowther et al .",
    "indeed , progenitors of such stars are believed to be core - hydrogen burning of stars with strong stellar winds ( crowther et al .",
    "1995 ) . the presence of wr 131 in the shell and its approximate distance of @xmath0 9.1 kpc ( georgelin et al .",
    "1988 ) comparable with the distance estimates of w58 complex ( @xmath0 7.9 to 9.3 kpc ) , favors a probable association between the wr 131 and w58 complex .",
    "the catalog of reed ( 1998 ) yields a few b - type stars which are projected inside the bubble , but their distances are not known so as to confirm their association .",
    "if indeed these sources are associated then the presence of shell can be due to the combined energy input from these sources .",
    "wr 131 is not located at the center of the shell but at an off - center position , which could be due to the combination of an inhomogeneous medium , proper motion of the star , anisotropic winds and projection effect along the line of sight .",
    "if we assume wr 131 is the source to produce shell due to its strong stellar winds and since wr phase is short lived ( @xmath0 10@xmath7 yr ) and the presence of wr star limits the maximal age @xmath0 4.5 - 5 myr of a cluster ( meynet & maeder 2005 ) , an upper limit of age @xmath0 4 - 4.5 myr can be assigned to wr 131 , considering the estimated dynamical age ( @xmath0 @xmath132 yr ) of the bubble by israel ( 1980 ) .",
    "if the age of wr 131 is @xmath0 4 - 4.5 myr then one would expect the ages of the second generation stars , ( if any ) , at the periphery of the bubble , should be less than that of a wr star .",
    "the presence of star formation activity , which might have started @xmath6 2 myr ago is evident at the north - eastern edge of the shell , with the existence of class i sources , astronomical masers , and regions containing young ob stars of ages 1 - 2 myr .",
    "the presence of seven regions at different spatial locations and possibly at different evolutionary stages suggests star formation activity has proceeded at multiple sites in the cloud .",
    "the presence of wr 131 star of age @xmath0 4 - 4.5 myr and young massive stars still in accretion phase ( e.g. , c1 and a ) , associated with the same complex , indicates distribution of stars of different ages in the region .",
    "israel ( 1980 ) suggested that at present the shell is colliding with a larger cloud to the northeast of w58 ( i.e. , east of k3 - 50c ) . in this conjuncture , one would expect sh 2 - 99 and k3 - 50d to be relatively evolved regions and k3 - 50c to be the least evolved source as we move from southwest to northeast . on a large scale , it seems to be consistent with the scenario of sequential star formation because the probable age of k3 - 50d is @xmath0 1 - 2 myr , whereas the expected age of k3 - 50c1 is of @xmath0 few @xmath2 10@xmath7 yr .",
    "this is further supported by the presence of more intense molecular material observed towards k3 - 50c than sh 2 - 99 ( israel 1980 ) , along with the average extinction gradient of 4.2 to 97 mag from k3 - 50d to k3 - 50c1 . however , it is not known whether the different condensations of sh 2 - 100 region were in different stages of evolution before the passage of ionization front generated by the stellar winds of wr 131 .",
    "it is also difficult to anticipate the projection/ orientation effect on the location of the wr star with respect to the sh 2 - 100 region .",
    "the initial mass of the cloud associated with the individual region is also an important parameter as it governs evolution of the cloud in presence of external radiation pressure .",
    "numerical models predict that if the pressure due to external ionized gas is too small to compress a massive molecular gas , the radiation field will not have any dynamic effect on the cloud ( bertoldi & mckee 1990 ; lefloch & lazareff 1994 ) . at present",
    "the sequential star formation around sh 2 - 100 region due to the interaction of bubble is suggestive .",
    "a more complete picture can be revealed with the help of high resolution , high sensitivity and co observations covering the entire w58 complex . a positional and chronological study of the ysos associated with the complex ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "2005 ; ogura 2006 ) can support the validity of sequential star formation . since the region studied here",
    "is deeply embedded and shows a large variation in extinction , we would like to determine the intrinsic properties of the low mass pms stars identified from the nir and irac cc diagrams with follow up deep optical / nir spectroscopic observations in order to determine their relative ages by constructing intrinsic hertzsprung - russell diagrams .",
    "these observations will allow us to have a better understanding of star formation history across the entire region and a much clearer picture of the triggered star formation across the w58 complex .",
    "in this paper we have presented a multi - wavelength study of the stellar contents and physical environment of star - forming region ( k3 - 50 ) in the proximity of diffuse region sh 2 - 100 .",
    "k3 - 50 consists of seven regions ( a , b , c1 , c2 , d , e and f ) of different classes and are thought to be a part of w58 molecular cloud complex located at a distance of @xmath0 8.7 kpc .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we have identified the ionizing star of the optical visible nebula k3 - 50d .",
    "optical spectroscopy suggests that an o4v star is responsible for the ionization .",
    "we have estimated a distance of @xmath0 8.6 kpc for the k3 - 50d region .",
    "the approximate distances for the k3 - 50e and k3 - 50f regions have been estimated from the nir photometry and radio continuum flux densities following the methodology by comern & torra ( 2001 ) .",
    "the distance estimation suggests that both the regions are likely the part of the w58 complex .",
    "we identified the probable exciting sources for six regions using the @xmath13 vs. @xmath83 cm diagram .",
    "the photometric spectral types of the ionizing sources agree well within a subclass with that derived from radio observations based on the number of lyc photons .",
    "we derived physical parameters for all the five regions using 1280 mhz radio continuum observation .",
    "the regions cover a wide range in size ( @xmath0 0.2 to 1.6 pc ) , optical depth ( @xmath0 0.18 to 1.92 ) , rms electron density ( @xmath0 740 to 6390 @xmath4 ) and rate of lyc photons ( @xmath0 5.5 @xmath2 10@xmath123 s@xmath16 to @xmath0 1.1 @xmath2 10@xmath133 s@xmath16 ) .",
    "these physical parameters reflect different evolutionary stages of regions .",
    "we estimated the total mass of the cloud associated with one of the regions ( k3 - 50a ) which was found to be @xmath0 7800 @xmath130 . at the center of the cloud core",
    ", we detected a possible massive yso with @xmath134 @xmath0 42 @xmath28 4.4 @xmath111 , accreting with an effective envelope accretion rate of log(@xmath117 ) @xmath0 -3.8@xmath28 0.2 @xmath111 yr@xmath16 .",
    "\\5 . combining irac photometry with ground - based nir observations within an area of @xmath0 8@xmath10 @xmath2 8@xmath10 , we found a total of 150 objects with circumstellar disks ( i.e. , ysos ) , suggesting a site of active star formation .",
    "the distribution of these ysos ( class ii , class i and @xmath61 @xmath69 1.8 sources ) in sh 2 - 100 sfr correlates well with the association of gas and dust within the region .",
    "the distribution of ysos at the periphery of shell on a large scale supports the speculation by israel ( 1980 ) that the star formation activity around k3 - 50 region might have been induced by an expanding spherical bubble which was created by strong stellar winds from older generation ob stars of the complex in the south - eastern direction .",
    "the sh 2 - 100 sfr region represents a broad sample of different stages of massive star formation all in the same cloud , from the cold , dense core at source c1 to the diffuse h ii region at source f. the conclusions drawn in this paper on this cloud should be relevant and applicable to further deep study of the region with high resolution and high sensitivity instruments .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a critical reading of the paper and several useful comments and suggestions , which greatly improved the scientific content of the paper .",
    "the authors would like to thank the staff of hct operated by indian institute of astrophysics , bangalore , irsf at south africa in joint partnership between s.a.a.o and nagoya university of japan and gmrt managed by national center for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research ( tifr ) for their assistance and support during observations .",
    "mrs would like to thank the tifr for the kind hospitality during his visits to the institute , where a part of the work reported was carried out .",
    "mrs also thanks t. p. prabhu and a. tej for helpful discussions , as well as n. chauhan and j. jose for their helpful discussions on the _ spitzer _ data reduction .",
    "iras - b is situated at @xmath0 3@xmath10.3 northwest of k3 - 50a .",
    "an analysis of the iras fluxes reveals that this source has color characteristics ( e.g. , log ( f25 ) /log ( f12 ) = 2.02 and log ( f60 ) /log ( f12 ) = 5.06 ) consistent with being an region ( wood & churchwell 1989 ) .",
    "a prominent nebulosity seen in the direction of iras - b is offset by @xmath0 15@xmath11 in the western direction from the position of iras - b ( see fig .",
    "our nir images reveal that the nebulosity contains few point sources and the position of the msx point source ( g070.3164 + 01.6493 ) falls on the nebulosity .",
    "the offset of iras - b may be due to the large iras beam .",
    "therefore , the more accurate position of the ir source associated with iras - b can be inferred from the nearby msx point source ( g070.3164 + 01.6493 ) , since the msx survey has global absolute astrometric accuracy of 1@xmath11.9 . the msx cc plot ( see fig .",
    "18 ) for the source suggests iras - b to be a massive yso . since there is no study available in the literature for iras - b , the distance to the source is unknown , which puts a limit to support in favor of a physical connection of this source with sh 2 - 100 , rather than a chance of alignment along the line of sight .",
    "however , if we assume a distance 8.7 kpc , our analysis leads to many useful conclusions .",
    "we acknowledge that this assumption is highly speculative , hence the results should be taken with caution .",
    "analysis of nir cm and cc diagrams suggest that the most luminous member associated with iras - b is a zams star of spectral type @xmath0 o7-o8 with nir excess .",
    "since the source shows nir excess , the spectral class assigned on the basis of cm diagram could have been estimated as an early type rather than its real spectral type , but this still disagrees with the zams spectral type ( earlier than o3 ) derived from iras point source fluxes using the equation of casoli et al .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to large iras beam and/or presence of low mass stars , which can contribute significantly to the radiation emitted in the fir .",
    "if we assume that an o8 star is present in the region , the absence of radio emission ( up to @xmath0 5 mjy ) at 1280 mhz indicates that ( i ) either the ionizing star is heavily enshrouded by the dust so that all its ionizing radiation is absorbed or ( ii ) the region is suppressed by the accretion of matter ( see , e.g. , yorke 1986 ) or ( iii ) the source must be a zams star of spectral type later than b0 .",
    "the spectral type b0 has been estimated from the lyc photons derived using @xmath0 5 mjy flux ( 3@xmath44 flux of the map at 1280 mhz ) and the calibration table of panagia ( 1973 ) , for an electron temperature of 10@xmath5 k. in order to get a qualitative estimation of the evolutionary stage of the source , we have fitted the models by robitaille et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which are already described in section 6.2.3 .",
    "the sed is shown in fig .",
    "though , the number of data points used for the sed fitting are quite less , nevertheless as stated by robitaille et al ( 2007 ) , some of the parameters can be constrained more narrowly than the others , depending upon the available fluxes . the parameters computed from the models as described in section 6.2.3 ,",
    "imply a source of mass @xmath114 = 10.7 @xmath28 1.8 @xmath111 and total luminosity log@xmath115 = 3.4 @xmath28 0.2 @xmath116 lying behind 6.1 @xmath28 0.2 mag of visual extinction . in the absence of sub - mm and mm data points ,",
    "the resulting uncertainties in other parameters may be large , and therefore not quoted here .",
    "the mass of the object suggests a star of spectral type b2-b3v , but the lack of radio emission around the star at such a low visual extinction requires follow up high sensitivity , high frequency radio observations , along with spectroscopy to obtain the accurate nature of the massive star and its distance .",

    "<S> we present multiwavelength investigation of morphology , physical - environment , stellar contents and star formation activity in the vicinity of star - forming region sh 2 - 100 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the sh 2 - 100 region contains seven regions of ultracompact and compact nature . </S>",
    "<S> the present estimation of distance for three regions , along with the kinematic distance for others , suggests that all of them belong to the same molecular cloud complex . </S>",
    "<S> using near - infrared photometry , we identified the most probable ionizing sources of six regions . </S>",
    "<S> their approximate photometric spectral type estimates suggest that they are massive early - b to mid - o zero - age - main - sequence stars and agree well with radio continuum observations at 1280 mhz , for sources whose emissions are optically thin at this frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of the complex shows a non - uniform distribution of warm and hot dust , well mixed with the ionized gas , which correlates well with the variation of average visual extinction ( @xmath0 4.2 - 97 mag ) across the region . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the physical parameters of ionized gas with the help of radio continuum observations . </S>",
    "<S> we detected an optically visible compact nebula located to the south of the 850 @xmath1 m emission associated with one of the regions and the diagnostic of the optical emission line ratios gives electron density and electron temperature of @xmath0 0.67 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath0 10@xmath5 k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the physical parameters suggest that all the regions are in different stages of evolution , which correlate well with the probable ages in the range @xmath0 0.01 - 2 myr of the ionizing sources . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of infrared excess stars , selected from near - infrared and irac color - color diagrams , correlates well with the association of gas and dust . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of infrared excess stars , ultracompact and compact regions at the periphery of an shell , possibly created by a wr star , indicate that star formation in sh 2 - 100 region might have been induced by an expanding shell . </S>"
