    "free electrons in the interstellar medium ( ism ) affect the pulsar signal in three different ways : cold plasma dispersion , free - free absorption and scattering .",
    "the broadband pulsar signal gets dispersed in the ism resulting in delay in pulse arrival time , which is a function of wavelength , @xmath5 , and its magnitude is described by the quantity known as dispersion measure @xmath6 pc @xmath1 , where @xmath7 is the column electron density per @xmath8 and d is the distance to the pulsar in parsec .",
    "@xmath9 for a pulsar is obtained as a part of its discovery and if the distance @xmath10 to the pulsar is known ( by parallax method for example ) , then the mean electron density in the ism can be estimated . alternatively , if the mean @xmath7 is known ( either from observations or from the free electron density distribution model of the galaxy such as ne2001 by @xcite ) , the approximate distance to the pulsar can be determined .",
    "the pulsar signals also get absorbed by the free electrons in the ism .",
    "this process is known as free - free absorption which is responsible for the turnover observed in many of the pulsar spectra at lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "pulsar signals are also affected by the fluctuations of the electron density in the ism .",
    "such fluctuations give rise to random variations in the refractive index of the medium .",
    "the pulsar signal traverses through such irregularities and gets scattered in the process .",
    "this phenomenon , known as ` interstellar scattering ' of pulsar signals , was first investigated by @xcite .",
    "it essentially arises due to multipath propagation of the pulsar signal .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a narrow pulse with a sharp rise time , while passing through a gaussian distribution of irregularities will broaden in time due to scattering , giving rise to an exponential decay of the pulse with a characteristic timescale @xmath0 , known as the scatter broadening time .",
    "the multipath propagation also leads to a diffraction pattern in the observer s plane , which decorrelates over a characteristic bandwidth @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is of the order of unity .",
    "these scattering parameters are strongly frequency ( @xmath14 ) dependent and scale as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the power law index .",
    "if the same volume of electrons are responsible for dispersion and scattering , a simple scaling relation @xmath17 , can be shown to exist in the model of @xcite .",
    "in general , the scattering strength can be attributed to a power law electron density spectrum of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the wavenumber , and @xmath20 @xcite . for a kolmogorov distribution of irregularities , where @xmath21 , the scaling relation is expected to be @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "several attempts to verify these scaling relations and fathom an understanding of the ionized component of the ism exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "these investigations show that the observed values of @xmath16 is much lower ( @xmath23 4.0 ) than the theoretical value of 4.4 for several of the high @xmath9 pulsars .",
    "hence , accurate @xmath0 measurements over multiple frequencies are essential for these studies .    at meter wavelengths , the @xmath0 values for @xmath24 pc @xmath1 dominate over the intrinsic pulse width and it is possible to obtain reliable @xmath0 measurements . a survey of a number of highly dispersed pulsars with a possible detectability at 327 mhz with the aim of finding @xmath0 was carried out at ooty radio telescope ( ort ) by @xcite and @xcite for 47 pulsars out of 706 pulsars discovered by that time .",
    "currently @xmath252200 pulsars are known and the ort has been upgraded for improved sensitivity . hence , a large number of accurate @xmath0 measurements at 327 mhz using the ort are now possible . with this aim ,",
    "we have launched a survey of @xmath0 measurements . in this paper , we report results from the current survey , which includes several new @xmath0 measurements and significantly improved @xmath0 estimates for pulsars with previously measured values .",
    "observations were conducted for 124 pulsars from 2013 january to 2014 september using the ort , situated in southern india at a latitude of 11@xmath26 n. it has an offset parabolic cylindrical reflector , 530-m long in north - south direction and 30-m wide in east - west direction , placed on a hillside with a north - south slope of 11@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the feed array consists of 1056 dipoles , oriented along the north - south direction .",
    "hence , the telescope is sensitive only to the north - south polarization .",
    "the telescope operates at a central frequency of 326.5 mhz .",
    "the front - end electronics downconverts the signal to an intermediate frequency ( if ) of 30 mhz with a bandpass of 16 mhz @xcite .",
    "the 1056 dipoles are grouped in 22 modules with half of them each in north and south halves of the telescope . a separate",
    "if is obtained from each half after appropriately phasing the modules and combining their output to form 12 beams , which cover @xmath27 in the sky .",
    "recently , a new pulsar ort new digital efficient receiver , ponder , has been commissioned at the ort to process the if outputs @xcite .",
    "the two if outputs of beam 7 ( central beam ) are converted to baseband and 8-bit digitized in ponder after processing through a 16-mhz low pass filter .",
    "the digitized signals from the two halves are added in ponder and a 4096-point fast fourier transform is carried out in real - time across the 16 mhz passband , providing 2048 channels across the passband with a spectral resolution of 7.8125 khz .",
    "the channelised data were then incoherently dedispersed in real - time , to the nominal @xmath9 taken from the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite .",
    "ponder was also used to fold the dedispersed data in real - time to an appropriate number of bins , using tempo2 predictors @xcite with most of the ephemerides taken from atnf pulsar catalogue . in some cases , particularly for glitching pulsars ,",
    "ephemerides from recently published rotational parameters are used .",
    "see @xcite for more details on ponder and the real - time processing capabilities used for this study .",
    "the folded profiles were then analysed using the procedure described in section 2.2 .    the ort has been recently upgraded and currently has a sensitivity which is 1.6 times better than what it was in the previous similar studies @xcite .",
    "ponder is designed to digitize the 16 mhz bandwidth in contrast with the previous studies , which used a bandwidth of 10 mhz , giving a further improvement in sensitivity by a factor of 1.2 .",
    "additionally , the telescope has been refurbished which improved the gain of the telescope by a factor of 1.3 bringing it to 3.3 k / jy ( eg . , @xcite ) .",
    "ponder has been particularly useful for this project due to the following reasons .",
    "firstly , it eliminated the need for the storage of raw data with its real - time capability for channelisation , incoherent dedispersion and folding .",
    "this results in a smaller dedispersed time series and integrated profile as standard data products , which allowed a faster observations to analysis turn - around time , even for 8 hour long observations .",
    "secondly , it has a flexible spectral resolution , which enables minimization of the dispersion smear across a channel , and consequently allows for robust estimation of scatter - broadening parameters .",
    "it also has real - time coherent dedispersion capability eliminating this smear completely .",
    "for this project , a fixed spectral resolution of 7.8125 khz was used .",
    "lastly , it will allow real - time measurements of dynamic spectra , which will also be useful for measurements of ism effects on pulsed signals in future ( see @xcite for more details ) . the above mentioned capabilities",
    "are useful for future similar investigations of pulsar scatter - broadening .",
    "we selected 124 pulsars for our study using the following method .",
    "the pulsars in our sample lie in the ort observable declination , ( @xmath2 ) range of @xmath28 and have a flux density at 327 mhz greater than 1 mjy .",
    "the flux density at 327 mhz was estimated using available spectral index in the atnf catalogue . where the spectral index was not available , flux density at the frequency available in the atnf catalogue was scaled using a spectral index of -1.6 @xcite .",
    "the above criteria yielded a large number of pulsars , and the list was further pruned by removing pulsars with @xmath9s that are not sufficiently high , given that their @xmath0 values are likely to be significantly smaller than the intrinsic pulse profile width .",
    "pulsars with sufficiently large @xmath9 , where the estimated scattered pulse width ( obtained by scaling an existing @xmath0 measurement at another frequency by @xmath29 ) exceeds the pulsar period were also removed .",
    "the final list of pulsars lie in the @xmath9 range of 37@xmath3503 pc @xmath1 and is listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the observing time for each pulsar was fixed in the following manner . while for every pulsar at least 2000 pulses were acquired to get a stable profile , pulsars with low signal to noise ratio were integrated until a minimum peak signal to noise ratio of 5 was obtained .",
    "most of the observations were for 30 minutes duration , whereas observations were carried out in some special cases up to 8 hours due to the low signal to noise ratio of the pulsar .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]      the observed pulse profile @xmath30 is a convolution of intrinsic pulse shape @xmath31 with ( 1 ) the impulse response characterizing the scatter broadening in the ism @xmath32 , ( 2 ) the dispersion smear across the narrow spectral channel d(t ) and the instrumental impulse response , @xmath33 defined as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 denotes convolution .",
    "the rise times of the receivers and back end are small enough to consider the effect of @xmath33 , while @xmath36 is a rectangular function of temporal width given by the dispersion smearing in the narrow spectral channel for incoherent dedispersion .",
    "we use the ism transfer function @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the prime difficulty in extracting @xmath0 stems from the fact that the intrinsic unscattered pulse profile @xmath38 is unknown .",
    "in several earlier studies , various assumptions were made regarding @xmath38 with no clear advantages or disadvantages .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite assumed the @xmath38 to have a gaussian shape and simultaneously fitted for the pulse width and @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite used a clean based algorithm , where they claim to recover the intrinsic pulse profile and simultaneously give the pulse broadened profile , while @xcite used a high frequency unscattered profile as a model for @xmath38 . in this paper , we follow the method described by @xcite , hereafter referred as lkmll01 . for every pulsar in our sample , we searched for a high frequency profile in the epn data base , where the expected @xmath0 is significantly smaller than the pulse width . in cases , where such profiles were not available , often the widths of the profile at a high frequency were found in the literature .",
    "we used this width to construct a gaussian profile as a template for @xmath38 .",
    "finally , this model @xmath38 was used to obtain a best fit model by minimizing the normalized @xmath39 value @xcite defined by    @xmath40 ^ 2 ,   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the off - pulse root - mean - square ( rms ) , @xmath42 is the observed pulse profile , @xmath43 is the model profile and @xmath44 is the total number of bins in the profile . the model profile @xmath45 is scaled with the pulse amplitude @xmath46 , shifted by a constant offset @xmath47 in phase and fitted to a baseline @xmath48 to minimize the @xmath49 . for fitting purpose , we use the nonlinear fitting routine `` mrqmin '' given in numerical recipes @xcite , where the errors in @xmath0 is obtained from the covariance matrix .",
    "two examples of the fitting procedure used to estimate @xmath0 values are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the top panel of the left hand figure is the fit to the profile of psr b1900 + 01 , and the bottom panel is the high frequency profile obtained at 1.4 ghz , which has a single component and is used as a template @xmath50 .",
    "the fitting process yields an excellent fit to the data ( shown in the top panel of the figure ) with @xmath51 and @xmath52 ms .",
    "it is important to note that we have ignored the effect of pulse width and component evolution with observing frequency in our fitting algorithm .",
    "it is known that pulse width increases with increasing wavelength as @xmath53 due to radius to frequency mapping @xcite , and hence @xmath0 value that we obtain is an upper limit .",
    "however , in several cases , particularly for high @xmath9 pulsars , the @xmath0 evolution is significantly higher than the width evolution and hence the measured values of @xmath0 are robust . in the example of psr b1900 + 01 , the pulse width is expected to increase from a higher frequency profile by a factor of 1.5 whereas the expected increase in @xmath0 is a factor of 40 , indicating that the @xmath0 measurement is reliable .",
    "however , the values of @xmath0 can be affected by the presence of an unidentified pulse component on the trailing part of the profile , as discussed by lkmll01 .",
    "they suggested that an increased error bar to 3 standard deviations , is usually sufficient to account for these effects .",
    "it is noteworthy that for @xmath2570% of the pulsars in our sample , the above procedure serves as an acceptable model .",
    "the remaining @xmath2530% of pulsars in our sample has multiple component profiles , both at higher and lower frequencies ( except three cases that are discussed below ) . for these pulsars , applying the method of lkmll01",
    "is not possible .",
    "the profile evolution in pulsars is such that the location and amplitude of the high frequency profile components change significantly at a lower frequency .",
    "however , if the separation of a profile component ( identified at both higher and lower frequencies ) from the adjacent one is significantly larger than @xmath0 , then the lkmll01 method can be applied to the component .",
    "the second example of psr b0736@xmath340 shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig1 ] pertains to such a case .",
    "the high frequency template for psr b0736@xmath340 has two components , and as shown in the figure , we have considered only the trailing component as a model and fitted this to the trailing component of the pulse profile at 327 mhz .",
    "this has resulted in significantly better fitting and hence estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "we have applied this procedure to our data wherever applicable ( @xmath2530% of the pulsars presented here ) . to gain additional confidence in this method , we have performed extensive simulations , where we created unscattered templates with two gaussian components and convolved with the exponential transfer function to get the scattered profile for an input @xmath0 value .",
    "we then used the procedure described above to extract @xmath0 from the scattered profile .",
    "multiple templates were obtained by varying the amplitude ratio and the separation of the gaussian components , and for each case the corresponding @xmath0 value was estimated .",
    "we find that for majority of the cases , where components could be resolved , we are able to recover the @xmath0 value ( within 3 standard deviation ) . when the separation between the components and/or the ratio of the amplitudes are too small , we tend to overestimate @xmath0 by about 10% , as can be seen in figure 64 of the supplementary material .",
    "there are 3 pulsars in our sample , namely b1737@xmath330 , b1834@xmath310 and b1859 + 03 , which have a slow rising edge and heavily scatter - broadened trailing edge .",
    "for these pulsars , the lkmll01 model is found inadequate , since the rising edge of the profiles are poorly modelled .",
    "if we _ assume _ that there is no unidentified emission component that changes the profile shape in the rising edge for these pulsars , then there exist a possibility that the transfer function of the ism towards these pulsars are responsible for these profile changes .",
    "we have explored whether the transfer function for a uniformly distributed ism with gaussian density fluctuation ( see @xcite ) given by @xmath54 , can model the data , since the rising edge of this transfer function increases much more slowly as seen in the data . in all the three cases , we found reasonable fits and they yielded @xmath0 values of 62@xmath553 , 203@xmath5523 and 103@xmath552 , respectively ( the fitted profiles are shown separately in the online supplementary material ) .",
    "however , before we conclude that the effect seen in these pulsars are related to a different transfer function , futher modelling of the evolution of pulse profiles based on high quality multifrequency observations need to be done , which is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the estimated @xmath0 , the error @xmath56 and the @xmath39 for all the 124 pulsars in our sample .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows the distribution of reduced @xmath39 for our sample , which lie in a range of 0.5 to 1.5 and peaks around unity .",
    "this confirms that the model profile @xmath57 is a good fit to the data for majority of pulsars in our sample . in the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] , @xmath0 values for 31 pulsars which are common between our sample ( the abscissa ) and that of @xcite and @xcite ( the ordinate )",
    "are shown for comparison .",
    "the @xmath0 values obtained between these two methods are generally in good agreement with each other .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to provide a large database of @xmath0 measured at 327 mhz ( p - band ) . in this paper",
    ", we have estimated @xmath0 values for 124 pulsars , in which , as far as we know , 58 are new measurements at p - band , which thereby increases the @xmath0 measurements at 327 mhz by almost 40% . including our current sample and measurements available in the literature",
    ", we found 154 pulsars for which scattering measurements exist at p - band : out of which 136 have @xmath0 measurements , with 124 from this paper and 12 from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "18 have decorrelation bandwidth @xmath11 measurements from @xcite .",
    "additionally , we found 134 pulsars having @xmath0 values and 70 pulsars with @xmath11 values measured at different frequencies .",
    "thus , currently scattering measurements exist for 358 pulsars spanning a dm range of 2.9  1073 pc @xmath1 .",
    "+    @c@ +   +    generally , scattering properties along various lines of sight to the pulsars are examined by studying the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ taudm ] shows the @xmath0 versus @xmath9 plot at 327 mhz for all the 358 pulsars .",
    "the filled circles are direct measurements at 327 mhz .",
    "the black triangles are @xmath11 measurements at 327 mhz which have been converted to @xmath0 using the relation @xmath58 , where @xmath13 is assumed to be 1.16 ( see @xcite for discussion ) . for convenience of discussion ,",
    "let us define four different @xmath9 regions in the @xmath0 versus @xmath9 plot : region @xmath59 for @xmath9 range 0 to 40 pc @xmath1 , region @xmath60 for @xmath9 range 40 to 100 pc @xmath1 , region @xmath61 for @xmath9 range 100 to 500 pc @xmath1 and region @xmath62 for @xmath9 range above 500 pc @xmath1 .",
    "it may be noted that in the region @xmath60 , no reliable @xmath0 or @xmath11 measurements are currently available at p - band . in this range at p - band ,",
    "the @xmath0 becomes unreliable since the expected @xmath0 values are significantly smaller than the profile widths .",
    "the @xmath11 values are also difficult to measure since they decorrelate over a significantly small bandwidth .",
    "further @xmath0 measurements at p - band in the region @xmath62 is not possible since the scattering time exceeds the pulsar period .",
    "however , the 327 mhz data reveal the basic feature of the @xmath0 versus @xmath9 relation , where at low @xmath9 i.e. , region @xmath59 , the slope is flatter compared to the high @xmath9 region @xmath61 @xcite .    in order to fill in data at p - band for the missing @xmath9",
    "ranges @xmath60 and @xmath62 in figure  [ taudm ] , we rely on scattering measurements at higher frequencies . in region @xmath60 , @xmath11 measurements and in region @xmath62 ,",
    "@xmath0 measurements are available at higher frequencies .",
    "these measurements therefore need to be scaled to 327 mhz using a frequency scaling law @xmath63 .",
    "the properties of the kolmogorov spectrum of electron density irregularities , which has been widely used as a reference to understand the @xmath0 versus @xmath9 curve , predicts @xmath644.4 . however , observationally there is evidence that the frequency scaling of @xmath644.4 might not be uniform across the pulsar sample . for dms below about 100 pc @xmath1 @xcite and @xcite found @xmath16 to be consistent with 4.4 , whereas for higher dm values , @xcite and @xcite reported a much smaller value of @xmath16 @xmath25 3.44 . the scaling relation for these pulsars",
    "were obtained on a case by case basis using detailed modelling and measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite conducted an exhaustive study for obtaining @xmath16 treating it as a parameter ( constant across the whole dm range ) and fitted for @xmath16 using direct estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath11 at the observing frequencies .",
    "it yielded a value of 3.86@xmath550.16 .",
    "currently more accurate measurements are required to establish the frequency scaling as the function of dm .",
    "here we use @xmath64 4.4 , which can be referenced to the kolmogorov spectrum and scaled the scattering measurements to 327 mhz using the frequency dependence of @xmath65 ( note that the @xmath11 measurements are converted to @xmath0 using @xmath66 ) .",
    "the scaled @xmath11 and @xmath0 values are shown as open triangles in figure  [ taudm ] .",
    "the combined @xmath0 versus @xmath9 plot is obtained using all currently available scattering measurement data of 358 pulsars .",
    "we fitted the empirical relation @xmath67 , as was suggested by @xcite . by fixing @xmath68 ,",
    "the term @xmath69 can provide a useful description for assessing the deviation of @xmath0 with @xmath9 from the kolmogorov theory .",
    "the best form of the fit ( shown as solid curve in the figure ) corresponds to @xmath70 which is consistent with earlier studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that there is a large spread in @xmath0 for a given @xmath9 and in the bottom panel of figure  [ taudm ] , the fractional residual ( i.e. ( data - model)/model ) is shown , where it appears that with increasing @xmath9 , the spread in @xmath71 increases .",
    "there are a few reasons for the spread in @xmath0 measurements .",
    "as discussed earlier , the methods applied for estimating @xmath0 can lead to uncertainties due to ambiguity in the intrinsic pulse shape .",
    "this mostly affects @xmath0 values in regions @xmath59 and @xmath60 at p - band .",
    "however , for larger @xmath9s , i.e. , regions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath0 values are significantly larger than the pulse profile widths , and hence the ism properties are mostly the reason for the observed spread in @xmath0 .",
    "clearly our analysis reveals several anomalous lines of sights , for example psr b1015@xmath356 has a @xmath9 of 436 pc @xmath1 while the measured @xmath0 is 13 ms which is a factor of 10 lower than the mean @xmath0 for that @xmath9 .",
    "anomalous scattering is a commonly observed phenomenon , and is most probably related to inhomogeneous distribution of scattering material along pulsar lines of sight .",
    "the indirect ( i.e. non p - band measured ) @xmath0 values in figure  [ taudm ] depends on @xmath13 and the frequency scaling .",
    "the change in @xmath13 in the lower @xmath9 range can lead to a change in the slope of the @xmath0 versus @xmath9 relation . as argued by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "there is very little allowance in the theory for changing @xmath13 values from close to unity .",
    "however the frequency scaling of @xmath65 used in figure  [ taudm ] has been a subject of scrutiny in recent studies by @xcite .",
    "these careful studies of multifrequency @xmath0 measurements revealed that at high @xmath9 ( @xmath72500 pc @xmath1 ) the frequency scaling is about 3.4 , which is significantly smaller than the kolmogorov value .",
    "this can result in flattening of the slope in the region @xmath62 of the @xmath0 versus @xmath9 curve , and only a systematic multifrequency study to obtain scattering estimates for a large sample of pulsars can resolve some of these issues .",
    "however there is significant overlap of pulsars with direct p - band @xmath0 measurements ( filled circles ) and frequency scaled @xmath0 measurements in the @xmath9 region @xmath61 , where no differences in @xmath0 values can be seen .",
    "we can hence speculate that for pulsars below @xmath9 500 pc @xmath1 , the frequency scaling of @xmath65 is a good approximation ( also a result supported by @xcite ) .",
    "it has been also speculated that the breakdown of the homogeneity condition in the ism @xcite can lead to the steepening of @xmath0 values .",
    "this can be checked by evaluating the scattering strength @xmath73 along pulsar lines of sight . in the top panel of figure  [ cn2 ] , the estimated @xmath74 for all the 358 pulsars as a function of pulsar distance in kpc",
    "the @xmath73 values were obtained for a homogeneous medium with kolmogorov spectrum using the expression given by @xcite as @xmath75 , where @xmath14 is the observing frequency in ghz , @xmath10 is distance to the pulsar in kpc and @xmath11 is the decorrelation bandwidth in mhz .",
    "the distance to the pulsars were obtained using the @xcite model of galactic free electron density distribution .",
    "the dashed line in the top panel of figure  [ cn2 ] correspond to the case of homogeneous medium where @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with all earlier studies @xcite where lines of sight to pulsars below 3 kpc has a value closer to @xmath33.5 . for the distant pulsars ,",
    "the deviation is significant towards larger @xmath74 values which indicate that high level of inhomogeneity exists along these lines of sight .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ cn2 ] shows the distribution of all 358 pulsars in the galaxy , where majority of the pulsars lie towards the inner regions of the galaxy and hence are likely to encounter several hii regions .",
    "note that the enhanced scattering seen around galactic longitude of 260@xmath77 is due to the gum nebula @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we report new observations of 124 pulsars using the ooty radio telescope at 327 mhz with the aim of estimating scatter broadening ( @xmath0 ) values .",
    "our attempt has yielded 58 new @xmath0 measurements at 327 mhz , which increases the sample with known @xmath0 measurement at 327 mhz by about 40% .",
    "the major difficulty in estimating @xmath0 lies in the uncertainty of knowing the intrinsic ( unscattered ) pulse shape .",
    "we have hence used the method suggested by @xcite in which the intrinsic pulse profile is obtained from higher frequencies where the profile is unscattered .",
    "this method significantly reduces the uncertainty in @xmath0 measurements .",
    "further we have also assimilated 234 scattering measurements from the literature and have used them to study the ism properties .",
    "our results are consistent with earlier works where , for low @xmath9 ( or below 3 kpc ) , the ism is consistent with kolmogorov spectrum , but it deviates significantly for high @xmath9 pulsars . in figure",
    "[ taudm ] , the @xmath0 values at p - band for several pulsars were obtained estimating @xmath0 from @xmath11 using a frequency scaling of @xmath65 from higher frequencies .",
    "the high sensitivity of the upgraded ort and the flexibility of ponder will be useful to enhance the sample of such observations further , particularly to weaker pulsars , which were not covered in this study .",
    "we also note that these measurements can be improved by observations of pulsars at multiple frequencies with instruments , such as the gmrt , covering the low @xmath9 sample with frequencies including and below 300 mhz and the high @xmath9 sample at 610 or 1420 mhz and such observations are planned in future .",
    "we acknowledge the kind help and support provided by the members of radio astronomy centre during these observations . the ort is operated and maintained at the radio astronomy centre by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for a critical review which helped in improving the manuscript significantly .",
