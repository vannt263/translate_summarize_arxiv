    "the nirspec spectra of v723  cas showed strong h and coronal emission features nearly 10 years after outburst ( see figure  [ fig:1d ] ) . based upon the observed expansion velocities of the emission lines , the time since outburst , and the estimated distance to v723  cas , we believed v723  cas would be an ideal object to obtain spatially resolved spectra with osiris and the keck  ii laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgsao ) .",

    "the keck lgsao system requires a natural tip  tilt guide star and in this case , v723  cas was its own tip  tilt guide star .",

    "broadband filters would cover the entire @xmath22band , but reduce the field of view by a factor of 3 .",

    "bandwidth filters yielding wavelength coverages of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "conditions on 2005 september 13 were marginal : @xmath22band seeing was @xmath26 and relative humidity was above 50@xmath14 .",
    "the lgsao system performed well giving a @xmath22band full  width , half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath27 .",
    "we estimated the strehl ratio to be 20@xmath14 . for 2006",
    "august 31 , we observed in the kn1 and kn3 bands yielding wavelength coverage of @xmath28 and @xmath25 .",
    "the measured @xmath29band seeing on 2006 august 31 was @xmath30 .",
    "there were patchy clouds for part of the night , but none were observed in the location of v723  cas during our observations .",
    "the keck  ii lgsao system employs redundant systems for safety and performance monitoring that can double as cloud detectors .",
    "the first is laser safety observers who are posted outside the observatory to watch for airplanes .",

    "sky conditions for our 2007 september 03 observation were excellent : clear skies , low humidity , and @xmath22band seeing of @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , this observation was obtained after a wavefront controller and sensor upgrade to the keck ao system .",
    "we observed in the kn1 , kn3 , and kn5 bands yielding wavelength coverage of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively . for our 2008 observations ,",
    "the sky was clear and @xmath29band seeing was measured to be @xmath35 .",
    "we observed in the kn1 , kn3 , and kn5 bands as in 2007 . during each night , we observed an a0v star in the same instrument configurations for telluric correction .",
    "the nirspec spectra are conventional long  slit spectrograph data .",
    "calibration frames were acquired at various times during the night using the internal flat lamp and arc lamps and with the same instrumental setup as our science observations .",
    "we used these calibration frames and the idl  based reduction package redspec to reduce the nirspec data in the standard way .",
    "the osiris drp is an idl  based package built on separate modules and is available for download from the keck observatory osiris tools page .",
    "the drp calls the modules in sequential order to reduce raw , 2d images into 3d data cubes . after this basic reduction , there are drp modules that mosaic data cubes and assist in telluric correction . for telluric correction ,",
    "modules extract one dimensional ( 1d ) spectra of bright objects , remove intrinsic spectral features from 1d spectra , remove a blackbody curve from 1d spectra , and divide 3d data cubes by 1d spectra .",
    "when the 2d pixel information is converted into a 3d data cube , each spatial @xmath36 position in the data cube is linked to a spectrum and not just an intensity .",
    "we follow the euro3d convention and refer to each @xmath36 position in the 3d data cube as a `` spaxel '' , or spatial pixel .",
    "each spaxel maps to a lenslet so here , each spaxel is @xmath20 per side .",
    "the basic reduction sequence for these data removes detector artifacts as follows : 1 ) pairwise sky subtraction ; 2 ) removal of crosstalk associated with bright spectra on a single row of the detector ; 3 ) adjustment of the 32 detector channels to remove systematic bias ; 4 ) rejection of electronic glitches from detector readout ; and 5 ) rejection of cosmic rays .",
    "after these steps , the osiris drp reconstructs a data cube by extracting 2d spectra from the raw frame .",
    "extraction requires mapping the psf of each lenslet position as a function of wavelength with a white  light source .",
    "the osiris drp iteratively assigns flux from each pixel to its corresponding lenslet spectrum using the psf maps .",
    "once this is done , each spectrum is resampled onto a linear wavelength grid via interpolation and a wavelength solution to spectral arc lines .",
    "the final step inserts the extracted spectra into their proper spatial locations in a data cube .",
    "osiris data cubes are linear in spatial @xmath15 and @xmath16 and wavelength channel @xmath17 . in @xmath22band , each wavelength channel is separated by @xmath37 .",
    "after the object and telluric star data are reduced to the basic cube level , additional steps must be taken before the data can be analyzed .",
    "first , one extracts a 1d spectrum of the telluric star from its cube ; with intrinsic features removed .",
    "for slit spectrograph data , the next step is to divide the object spectrum by the telluric spectrum .",
    "the data cube analog is to divide the spectrum of each lenslet by the 1d telluric spectrum .",
    "if not done carefully , this approach can lead to poor telluric correction .",
    "a diagnostic for the quality of telluric correction comes from blank sky regions in the data cube : background  subtracted blank sky should have a flat spectrum both before and after telluric correction .",
    "when one has poor telluric correction , one sees over or under  corrections of the atmospheric absorption features in blank sky regions .",
    "we have found that blank sky regions of pairwise  subtracted data cubes often have a constant , non  zero offset within each channel ( wavelength slice ) that is well  modeled by a constant across wavelengths .",
    "we attribute this offset to the background level changing between the 900  second object frame and the 900  second sky frame . after subtracting the measured constant from each channel",
    ", we divide the spectrum of each lenslet in the object cube by the 1d telluric spectrum and see the expected diagnostic results : a slightly noisier continuum with values similar to the continua on either side of the telluric feature .",
    "v723  cas proved to be a bright continuum source throughout our observations",
    ". we do not detect continuum emission in the nebular region .",
    "the continuum of a classical nova long after outburst is dominated by light from the accretion disk as evidenced by studies of eclipsing systems ( horne 1985 ) . as such , it is not resolved and thus represents the psf of the data . in order to better study the extended emission line regions , we removed the point  source continuum from the data cube .",
    "the ability to separate the 3d data cube into a 2d image at each wavelength makes the continuum removal process straightforward .",
    "1 ) the integrated spectrum of the source is examined to determine a spectral range over which there are no emission lines and no atmospheric features .",
    "2 ) a continuum image is created by median  combining the pure continuum wavelength channels .",
    "note that this continuum image has the same @xmath15 and @xmath16 dimensions as the data cube .",
    "3 ) a 1d spectrum is extracted from a @xmath38 spaxel region of the object data cube centered on the peak of the continuum image .",
    "the 9spaxel extraction gives both a high signal  to  noise ratio and averages out the impact of a bad data cube element .",
    "4 ) an interpolation is performed over the emission features in the extracted spectrum and 5 ) the emission line ",
    "free continuum is smoothed with a boxcar 5 wavelength channels wide .",
    "6 ) at each wavelength , the value of the modified continuum spectrum is used to scale the peak of the source in the continuum image .",
    "the scaled continuum image is subtracted from each wavelength channel of the data cube .",
    "the result is demonstrated in figure  [ fig:2d ] as the 2d spectrum with the continuum removed accentuates the extended emission and shows little residual emission at the position of the point  like continuum .",
    "the subtraction process does not require psf modeling or fitting and is therefore robust .",
    "we note however that as v723  cas fades , the continuum subtraction residuals are larger relative to the shell emission in our later epoch observations .",
    "the nirspec spectrum of v723  cas shows that it is a strong emission line source , some 3285 days after discovery .",
    "as figure  [ fig:1d ] shows , the most prominent lines are pa@xmath39 , [ ]  1.96  @xmath40 , [ ]  2.04  @xmath40 , br@xmath41 , [ ]  2.32  @xmath40 , and [ ]  2.48  @xmath40 .",
    "the list of identified lines appears in table  [ tab : linelist ] .",
    "nearly all lines are double  peaked , indicating expansion as expected .",
    "the brightest emission lines were targeted for osiris follow  up .      the nova shell of v723  cas is resolved in both the spatial and wavelength dimensions of the 3d data cube .",
    "the high spatial resolution data reveal a complex structure of the nova ejecta . in order to highlight certain features of the nova ejecta",
    ", we display the data in various forms . these include 1d spectroscopy ( figure  [ fig:1d ] ) , 2d spectroscopy ( figure  [ fig:2d ] ) , narrowband imaging ( figure  [ fig : nb ] ) , and 3d spatial  velocity ( figure  [ fig : face ] and figure  [ fig : edge ] ) .",
    "the osiris data cube can be integrated over both spatial dimensions to create the equivalent of a slit spectrum of v723  cas .",
    "this allows a direct comparison with the nirspec spectrum as shown in figure  [ fig:1d ] and table  [ tab : linelist ] . for figure  [ fig:1d ] we extracted an @xmath42 spaxel box centered on the continuum source to approximate the @xmath43",
    "slit used in the nirspec spectrum .",
    "it is evident that [ ] is stronger compared to [ ] in 2005 than in 2004 .",
    "rudy et al . ( 2002 ) detected a weak [ ] line with a flux ratio compared to that of [ ] of @xmath44 in 1999 and @xmath45 in 2000 .",
    "thus , over the 19992008 span of observations the [ ] has strengthened significantly each year with respect to [ ] .",
    "the osiris spectral coverage is limited compared to that of nirspec so certain lines , such as [ ]  2.48  @xmath40 and br@xmath46 are not included in our spatially resolved study .",
    "the spectra from the osiris kn3 filter and nirspec did include features seen in @xcite , including ( 107 )  2.1882  @xmath40 , [ ]  2.2050  @xmath40 , and an unidentified line at near 2.2188  @xmath40 .",
    "while @xcite ultimately found this line to be unidentified , they did offer [ ]  2.2178  @xmath40 , hereafter [ ] , as a possible source .",
    "emission from [ ] does appear in osiris data taken near the galactic center ( ghez & do , private communication ) and our analysis shows the unidentified line center to be 2.2190  @xmath40 , a difference of 5 wavelength channels .",
    "for this reason , we concur with @xcite that this line is not due to [ ] . an important result of the spectral analysis is that the radial velocity of the nova shell remains constant over our 5 years of observation ( see figure  [ fig : const_vel ] ) .",
    "we use this fact in ",
    "[ distance ] , to determine the distance to v723  cas via expansion parallax .",
    "a useful feature of integral field instrumentation is the capability to create images using a customized bandpass tailored to any feature of the spectrum selected after the data have been acquired .",
    "figure  [ fig : nb ] shows custom narrowband images of selected emission features in the resolved nova ejecta from the coronal lines of [ ] , [ ] , [ ] and the hydrogen recombination line , br@xmath41 .",
    "most noticeable is the difference between the [ ] emission when compared to the [ ] and [ ] features .",
    "the [ ] feature is relatively smooth and consistent with a prolate spheroid shell .",

    "the ejecta expansion is evident over the four years of osiris observations      ifs data can be presented in a conventional 2d format for the purpose of highlighting certain features and to enable comparison to long slit data of more conventional spectrometers .",
    "figure  [ fig:2d ] is a sampling of 2d spectra of selected bands from the 2006 osiris data .",
    "the 2d spectra are produced by extracting a portion of the cube that would correspond to a slit  like region of interest if the slit were aligned north ",
    "south and @xmath47 in width .",
    "the intensity is summed in the @xmath15 spatial dimension ( e  w ) and then displayed as a function of wavelength versus the @xmath16 spatial dimension ( n  s ) . in the left column of figure  [ fig:2d ] ,",
    "the spectra are shown with the continuum . in the right column , the point  like continuum has been subtracted .",
    "it is apparent that the [ ] emission is distinctive in its spatial  velocity structure .",
    "we note that the continuum subtracted data confirm that the coronal emission originates exclusively in the ejecta while the hydrogen recombination br@xmath41 line appears to come from both the ejecta and the central source .",
    "more clearly evident in the 2d spectra than in narrowband images , the extended portion of br@xmath41 and  ( 107 ) appear to have a structure similar to that of [ ] and [ ] .",
    "in contrast , the unknown feature centered at 2.2190  @xmath40 is more like [ ] than [ ] .",
    "the spatially resolved ifs 3d data provide all the necessary information for an accurate distance determination .",
    "angular expansion and radial velocity measurements can be derived from the same dataset , an advantage over methods that use different measurements acquired at different times .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure  [ fig : inset ] , where we have overplotted spectra at various locations of the [ ] feature from 2007 .",
    "the 3d data cube allows us to spectroscopically confirm that the apparent ellipse of emission is consistent with an inclined circular torus with polar nodules perpendicular to the torus .",
    "we have overlaid an ellipse on the image to guide the reader s eye .",
    "spectra at positions along the major axis of the torus have zero radial velocity ; therefore , they are moving in the plane of the sky . at positions along the minor axis of the torus ,",
    "the spectra have double  peaked emission , with the se portion more blueshifted and the nw portion more redshifted .",
    "the spectra at positions away from the torus have the opposite velocity direction as the spectra on the torus , indicating a polar nodule structure .",
    "we make use of our knowledge of the morphology and inclination of the system to accurately determine a distance to v723  cas .",
    "rather than assume spherical symmetry of the nebula with hubble flow properties , the distance analysis in this study uses the equatorial torus portion of the expanding ejecta and is based on the assumption that the torus is circular , or azimuthally symmetric .",
    "we create a zero velocity image for each emission feature by selecting the wavelength channel or channels that correspond to the central wavelength of each emission feature .",
    "@xcite give the wavelength of [ ] to be @xmath48 .",
    "this corresponds to wavelength channels 31 and 32 in our kn1 data cubes .",
    "we determine the angular expansion rate by measuring the centroids of emission in the zero velocity image for [ ] , or in other words , the cross section of the torus that is expanding perpendicular to our line of sight . in a zero velocity image",
    ", the equatorial torus of emission appears as two peaks on opposite sides of the continuum location and moves purely in the plane of the sky ( see figure  [ fig : expand ] ) .",
    "we use only [ ] because its morphology lends itself to this analysis and the observations of [ ] cover a four year span . we do not include [ ] in the distance analysis because we have only two epochs of observations and we do not assume that the two lines are perfectly coincident nor co  moving .",
    "we fit the angular separation of the two emission peaks in the zero velocity image of each epoch by the method of linear least squares to determine an angular expansion rate , @xmath49 as seen in figure  [ fig : expand ] .",

    "we extract only the spectrum arising from the equatorial torus for our distance determination .",
    "our extracted [ ] spectrum is double  peaked as shown in figure  [ fig : const_vel ] . because we measure the angular expansion rate of the two emission peaks of the zero velocity image from each other , we must also measure the total velocity separation , @xmath52 , of the red and blue  shifted emission peaks for each epoch . we find @xmath53 .",

    "@xcite assume that the absolute magnitudes of hr  del and v723  cas are identical to find a distance , then average this with other distances in the literature to yield @xmath65kpc .",
    "the expansion parallax method in this study provides the most accurate determination of the distance to v723  cas .",
    "this distance may help provide an improvement in the calibration the mmrd relationship for slow novae .",

    "kpc , this gives 3370  au .",
    "for our visualization , we elected not to interpolate over spectral pixels such that we rounded the calculated number of spectral channels in 3370  au down to the nearest even integer .",
    "table  [ tab : cube ] shows this conversion in units of number of spectral channels in 3370  au for a given spectral feature and date .",
    "the conversion factor decreases with time since the measured velocity remains constant as the distance traveled by the torus increases from year to year .",

    " on view ( figure  [ fig : edge ] ) , again we see striking differences in the morphologies of the features .",
    "the polar nodules are visible in all cubes while any sign of an equatorial torus is absent from the [ ] cubes .",
    "the spatial 3d rendering allows the direct measurement of the polar  to  equatorial axial ratio of the nebula without dependence on viewing angle .",
    "based on data from 2008 , the polar regions were separated by 1670 au while the equatorial region spanned only 1270 au .",
    "thus , the axial ratio is relatively small , @xmath72 .",
    "morphological differences are not new in nova ejecta . using archival plates of dq  her",
    ", @xcite found an equatorial band and polar condensations in emission attributed to h@xmath39 while emission attributed to [ ] showed no equatorial feature .",
    "@xcite resolved an hourglass shaped shell in hr  del with an equatorial torus using hst narrow band imaging .",
    "they also found morphological differences between h and [ ] emission and point out the observations can critically constrain our knowledge of the history of convection during the tnr .",
    "in addition to shell morphology differences between emission lines , hr  del has much in common with v723  cas in terms of speed class , orbital parameters , and coronal emission .",
    "one difference is the polar  to  equatorial axial ratio of the shell .",
    "hr  del has a large axial ratio of @xmath73 for the prolate ellipsoidal shell that supports the shell shape rate of decline ( ssrd ) relationship proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , the ssrd relationship does not hold as strongly for v723  cas , one of the slowest novae on record , with its smaller axial ratio of @xmath72 .",
    "we note that axial ratio determined from direct imaging is highly dependent on the viewing angle and that future studies with ifs instruments could more accurately determine any relation of shell shape with other nova parameters .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the morphological difference between [ ] and [ ] and [ ] .",
    "the first is the shell is chemically homogenous , but contains `` clumps '' of denser material embedded within a sparser medium .",
    "this interpretation is typically used to resolve how emission from low and high  ionization potential species can co  exist ( see @xmath74 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while we do not see uniformly distributed clumps of dense material , the equatorial torus could provide some photon shielding .",
    "in fact , the ionization potentials of [ ] and [ ] are lower than that of [ ] ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 versus @xmath77 respectively ) , but we do not see an inner equatorial torus of [ ] as one might expect from this interpretation .    a second description may be that the ejecta are inherently homogeneous but there are two spatially distinct populations of electrons that permit lines from different ions to dominate the emission . due to the limited wavelength range of osiris and the resulting lack of the necessary combination of emission lines , we are unable to determine the electron temperatures or densities within the distinct regions of the v723  cas ejecta .",
    "previous studies and our nirspec spectra presented here lacked the spatial resolution to differentiate between emission regions ; thus , any determinations of electron properties are averaged over the entire shell . for these reasons , we are unable to adequately test the existence of multiple electron populations .",
    "the most intriguing interpretation considers that the shell may not be homogeneous and the observed differences are a result of separate ejection events , perhaps from different regions of the wd .",
    "@xcite explain the pronounced second brightening of the recent nova v2362  cyg as a separate tnr ejection event and @xcite suggested that the multiple peaks in the visual light curve of v723  cas may be the result of multiple mass ejection events .",
    "if so , multiple mass ejection events may be common because many novae have had multiple peaks in the visual light curves during their early evolution",
    ". a possible cause of multiple tnr ejection events may be that the tnr does not occur uniformly over the surface of the wd .    as the h  rich material accretes to the wd via a disk near the orbital plane , it is likely the accreted material is concentrated near the equator of the wd .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the tnr occurs first near the equatorial regions of the wd .",
    "if so , then the mass is ejected mostly in the orbital plane and is subjected to shaping during the common envelope ( ce ) phase .",
    "the structure of the v723  cas ejecta is similar to the fast nova v1974  cyg , with its well  defined equatorial torus @xcite .",
    "the ir spectrum of v1974  cyg @xcite exhibits many of the same emission features as in v723  cas , but at much higher expansion velocities .",
    "@xcite discuss the ejecta may have been shaped by the ce phase with binary orbit depositing angular momentum into the ce , thereby enhancing the density into the equatorial plane . if the fast moving ejecta of v1974  cyg was shaped into an equatorial torus by its ce phase , it is likely the binary orbit shaped the much slower ejecta of v723  cas during its ce phase .",
    "the energy from the tnr in the equatorial region may heat the higher latitudes of the wd , eventually triggering additional tnr events .",
    "if so , the subsequent mass ejections may be concentrated towards the poles .",
    "any observations of abundance gradients in nova ejecta may help constrain the knowledge of the history of convection during the tnr @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the ce phase and showed that slower novae are more likely to have the envelope ejected in the plane of the binary orbit .",
    "however they also predict very little mass loss in the polar direction . @xcite",
    "enhanced the ce model of @xcite by including envelope rotation which can produce more prolate shaped ejecta .",
    "our observations of v723  cas should be able to help constrain models such as these to learn more about the pre  outburst accretion phase and material mixing on the wd .",
    "if an equatorial torus is a result of the ce phase , the inclination of the torus can be assumed to be the same as the inclination of the binary orbit . for v723  cas",
    ", we measure the inclination to be @xmath58 .",
    "roche geometry can not produce an eclipse light curve at this inclination @xcite ; thus , the sawtooth pattern in the light curve with orbital period of @xmath78 measured by @xcite is likely due to heating effects of the secondary surface that faces the wd .",
    "we would expect the amplitude of the light curve variations in v723  cas to diminish with time as the radiation from the primary returns to quiescence .",
    "we have presented ifs observations of v723  cas with unprecedented spatial resolution in the ir .",
    "these data allow us to remove the point  like continuum and create custom narrowband `` filter '' images of coronal emission features that allow us to see 2 distinct ejecta morphologies .",
    "furthermore , our dataset allows us to determine a highly accurate distance of @xmath0kpc .",
    "we have used this distance to convert our @xmath79 data cubes into @xmath80 spatial data cubes that allow us to compare the true shapes various emission lines .",
    "the morphological differences are likely due to separate ejection events possibly due to an uneven tnr combined with some self  shielding of x ",
    "rays by the equatorial torus .",
    "we anticipate that these v723  cas data and future ifs data of classical novae will help constrain models that attempt to describe the nature of the outburst .",
    "the data presented herein were obtained at the w.  m.  keck observatory , which is operated as a scientific partnership among the california institute of technology , the university of california and the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "the observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the w.  m.  keck foundation .",
    "the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
