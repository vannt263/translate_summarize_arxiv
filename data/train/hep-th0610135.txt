    "the ads / cft correspondence is a duality between the large @xmath0 limit of @xmath1 superconformal field theories and string theory in a higher dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime @xcite . in this correspondence",
    "the ads space shows up both as a near horizon geometry of a set of coincident d - branes .",
    "precise prescriptions for the realization of the ads / cft correspondence were formulated in @xcite . in this correspondence ,",
    "bulk fields act as classical sources for boundary correlation functions @xcite@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one of the striking features @xcite of this correspondence is that it is a realization of the holographic principle @xcite@xmath2 @xcite :  the degrees of freedom of a quantum theory with gravity can be mapped on the corresponding boundary \" .",
    "string theory was originally proposed as a model for strong interactions with the successful results of veneziano amplitude in the regge regime @xcite@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however this model was unable to reproduce the experimental results for hard and deep inelastic scatterings .",
    "these behaviours were latter explained by qcd which is today the accepted theory to describe strong interactions . despite of its success in high energies , qcd is non perturbative in the low energy regime , where one needs involved lattice calculations .",
    "in fact qcd and strings may be viewed as complementary theories .",
    "this was first discovered by t hooft in the work @xcite where he found a relation between large @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theories and strings @xcite .",
    "one of the long standing puzzles for the string description of strong interactions was the high energy scattering at fixed angles .",
    "for string theory in flat space such a process is soft : the amplitudes decay exponentially with energy @xcite while both experimental data and qcd theoretical predictions @xcite indicate a hard behavior ( amplitudes decaying with a power of energy . a recent solution for this puzzle was proposed by polchinski and strassler @xcite , inspired by the ads / cft correspondence , considering strings in a 10 dimensional space which assimptotically tends to an ads@xmath3 times a compact space .",
    "this space is considered as an approximation for the space dual to a confining gauge theory which can be associated with qcd .",
    "an energy scale was introduced and identified with the lightest glueball mass .",
    "then they found the glueball high energy scattering amplitude at fixed angles ( with the correct qcd scaling ) integrating the string amplitude over the warped ads extra dimension weighted by the dilaton wave function .",
    "other approaches to this problem have also been discussed in @xcite@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the first proposal to deform the ads / cft correspondence to describe strong interactions is due to witten @xcite . in this work , inspired by hawking and page @xcite",
    ", he suggests that the ads space can acommodate a black hole ( the ads schwarzschild space ) and the horizon radius defines an energy scale which can be associated with the qcd mass gap .",
    "following this proposal some authors have calculated glueball masses in this space @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other gauge / string dualities were discussed in @xcite-@xcite .    using the infrared cutoff proposed by polschinski and strassler we have calculated glueball masses in an ads slice from the zeros of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "this approach was later extended to higher spin states and applied to calculate masses of light barions and mesons @xcite .",
    "this description of higher spin states was then applied to obtain the regge trajectories of glueballs @xcite , which showed to be consistent with the soft pomeron trajactory .",
    "antoher successful application of the ads / cft correspondence is the calculation of wilson loops .",
    "using this duality one can identify the worldsheet area with the wilson loop area of the correspponding gauge theory .",
    "then , for static strings one finds the corresponding energy configuration .",
    "this idea has been implemented independently by rey and yee @xcite , and maldacena @xcite .",
    "it was later generalized to others spaces @xcite .",
    "we have considered the calculation of wilson loops in a ads slice @xcite finding the well known cornell potential @xcite-@xcite for a heavy quark anti - quark pair .",
    "this calculation was extended to finite temperature showing a deconfining phase trasition @xcite .    in this article",
    "we are going to review these recent results regarding approximate stringy descriptions of strong interactions .",
    "let us start by briefly reviewing some early results on strong interactions which lead to the proposal of string theory .",
    "these results date back to the decade of 1960 .",
    "the first is the experimental observation , in hadronic scattering , of an apparently infinite tower of resonances with mass and angular momenta related by @xmath4    where @xmath5 ( gev)@xmath6 is the regge slope .",
    "another important fact is that the properties of hadronic scattering in the so called regge regime are nicely described by the amplitude postulated by veneziano ( in terms of mandelstan variables ( @xmath7 ) ) @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the euler gamma function and @xmath10 .    a strong motivation for relating hadrons to strings is the fact that these two results of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) can be reproduced from a relativistic bosonic string @xcite .",
    "after quantization , one finds that the spectrum of excitations shows up in representations satisfying eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the string scattering amplitudes also reproduce the veneziano result eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .    on the other hand , some problems concerning a possible string description of hadronic physics have been a challenge for physicists for a long time .",
    "one of them is the behavior of the scattering amplitudes at high energy .",
    "if one considers the regge limit , corresponding to @xmath11 with fixed @xmath12 the veneziano amplitude behaves as @xmath13    in agreement with experimental results .",
    "actually this was one of the inputs for building up the veneziano amplitude .",
    "however considering high energy scattering at fixed angles that correspond to the limit @xmath14 with @xmath15 fixed the amplitude behaves as ( soft scattering ) @xmath16    while experimental results for hadrons show a hard scattering behavior @xmath17    that is reproduced from qcd @xcite .",
    "recently polchinski and strassler @xcite introduced an infrared cut off in the ads space and reproduced the hard scattering behavior of strong interactions at fixed angles from string theory .",
    "inspired by the ads / cft correspondence they assumed a duality between gauge theory glueballs and string theory dilatons in an ads slice and found the qcd scaling .",
    "this scaling was also obtained in @xcite from a mapping between quantum states in ads space and its boundary found in @xcite .",
    "we considered an ads slice as approximately dual to a confining gauge theory .",
    "the slice corresponds to the metric @xmath18    with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an energy scale chosen as the mass of the lightest glueball .",
    "we used a mapping between fock spaces of a scalar field in ads space and operators on the four dimensional boundary , defined in @xcite .",
    "considering a scattering of two particles into @xmath21 particles one finds a relation between bulk and boundary scattering amplitudes @xcite @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the scaling dimension of the boundary operators and @xmath24 is the boundary momentum scale .",
    "this leads to the scaling of the amplitude @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the total dimension of scattered particles .",
    "this reproduces the qcd scaling of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) . for some other results concerning qcd scattering properties from string theory see",
    "also @xcite-@xcite .",
    "using the phenomenological approach of introducing an energy scale by considering an ads slice we found estimates for scalar glueball mass ratios @xcite . in the ads@xmath3 slice we considered dilaton fields satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath27 @xmath28    where @xmath29 ,",

    "our estimates compared with @xmath41 lattice @xcite and ads - schwarzschild @xcite ( in gev ) are shown in table i.    .four dimensional glueball masses in gev with dirichlet boundary conditions .",

    ".            for dirichlet boundary conditions , taking the states @xmath43 with @xmath44 we found @xmath46    as shown in figure 2 .",
