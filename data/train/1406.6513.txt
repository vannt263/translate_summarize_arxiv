    "<S> we report a systematic and ab - initio electronic structure calculation of ca@xmath0m@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  with m = ca , sr , eu , la , ce , pr , nd , pm , sm , na , k , rb . </S>",
    "<S> the recently reported experimentally observed structural trends in rare earths - doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  compounds are successfully predicted and a complete theoretical description of the pressure induced orthorhombic to collapsed tetragonal transition is given . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the transition pressure is reduced by electron doping and rises linearly with the ionic size of the dopants . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our description for the realization of a superconducting phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the family of iron based superconductors ( sc ) continues to grow with the discovery of new systems that add to the hundreds already known@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in spite of this enormous amount of experimental data , an ab - initio theory describing these superconductors is still missing , and the search for new materials is guided only by some observed features that appear to be in common .    even if it is not a general rule , the so - called parent compounds do not superconduct without doping@xcite or without applying high pressure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rationale for this behavior could be naively ascribed to the necessity to destabilize the orthorhombic ( o ) antiferromagnetic order of the parent compounds to promote a magnetic mediated pairing field@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , superconductivity is realized in tetragonal ( t ) phases only after the magnetic order is suppressed , although some coexisting phases were discovered in 122 compounds@xcite .    in the so - called 122 family ( mfe@xmath3as@xmath3 , m = ca , ba , sr ) </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity can be induced under high pressure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical pressures at which superconductivity is detected varies with m@xcite and with the pressure conditions@xcite ( hydrostatic and non - hydrostatic ) . at the same time , the members of the 122 family show a pressure induced structural phase transition to a _ collapsed tetragonal _ ( ct ) phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main experimental evidence of the ct phase transition is the sudden decrease of the @xmath4 lattice parameter and a subsequent increase of the in - plane @xmath5 lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> first - principles calculations were able to describe this phase transition as induced by the formation of a direct as - as bond along the @xmath4-axis of the tetragonal phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ct phase is predicted to be a non - magnetic phase ( the magnetic moment being zero on the fe sites ) in agreement with experimental results@xcite which report the disappearance of the magnetic response .    in ba and sr 122 compounds , where the o - t and t - ct are well separated in pressure@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that the superconducting phase is realized across the o - t transition ( even if the role of non - hydrostaticity of the pressure medium is not clear ) , while it was debated in cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  where the transitions are very near in pressure@xcite and hysteresis effects are relevant . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  the precise nature of the crystallographic structure of the superconducting phase is under debate , but the ct phase obtained under hydrostatic pressure conditions@xcite seems to be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that superconductivity is realized in a tetragonal paramagnetic structure ( not collapsed ) realized only under non - hydrostatic conditions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phase should be characterized by the proximity of a magnetic instability absent in the ct phase .    </S>",
    "<S> this subject was revived with the discovery of high temperature superconductivity ( up to 45 - 49 k ) in cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  doped with trivalent rare - earth ( re ) metal atoms ( la , pr , ce , nd ) substituting the divalent ca atoms@xcite . it was demonstrated that rare earths have high solubility ( up to 27% in ref .  ) in cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  mainly due to close matching between ionic - radii of re and ca , and that their incorporation suppresses the low temperature afm ordering in favor of the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> application of hydrostatic pressure on the doped materials is shown to increase further the critical temperature@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , neutron diffraction experiments as a function of temperature revealed an interesting structural property : depending on the re dopants , the low temperature phase shows the characteristics of the ct phase@xcite . in fact , </S>",
    "<S> some of the systems ( pr , nd doped for example ) exhibit a low temperature phase in which the out - of - plane axis shrinks of about 10% its high temperature value . on the other hand , when doped with la or ce , this last structural phase transition is not observed . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , superconductivity is found irrespective of the presence or not of the o - ct transition .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the scenario was further enriched with the reports of superconductivity in ca@xmath6sr@xmath7fe@xmath2as@xmath2 at high pressure@xcite and of quenched fe magnetic moment in the collapsed tetragonal phase of ca@xmath8pr@xmath9fe@xmath2as@xmath2@xcite .    at the moment </S>",
    "<S> many questions remain to be answered , in particular regarding the origin of the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the details of the structural and electronic properties of these new phases are still unknown and it is not clear if the magnetic correlations are suppressed / enhanced upon rare - earth doping in the t phase and the ct phase@xcite . as a first step in the comprehension , we report first - principles dft@xcite prediction of structural , magnetic and electronic properties of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  upon doping with re . in addition , we extended the study to isovalent alkaline earths and eu@xmath10 and consider the effect of hydrostatic pressure on doped systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we start our discussion considering the physics of the parent compound , cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory successfully predicts the structural collapse of the tetragonal phase at a pressure p@xmath11 of 0.8 gpa , as calculated from the crossing point of the free energy of the two phases ( the o and ct ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in reasonable agreement with experimental evidences of o - ct phase transition at @xmath12 gpa@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is in part due to computational accuracy , to the gga functional and experimental uncertainties@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of both o and ct solution at the same pressure , means that the two phases are locally stable . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the first order nature of the phase transition and suggests possible experimental hysteresis effects , as indeed reported@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated ct lattice constant ( see table  [ tab : data ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure ] ) are @xmath13  , @xmath14   ( near the transition pressure ) , to be compared with experimental values 3.99   and 10.62  . </S>",
    "<S> the o phase has @xmath15  , @xmath16   and @xmath17  , while the experimental value@xcite is @xmath18  , @xmath19   and @xmath20  .    </S>",

    "<S> the curves follow the phase that minimizes the enthalpy as a function of p. the data points that lie off from the lines are locally stable solutions with higher enthalpy . </S>",
    "<S> the structural transition is marked by a collapse of the @xmath4 lattice parameter ( see panel @xmath5 ) and an expansion in the @xmath21 directions ( @xmath22 denotes the average between the two in plane axis parameters ) as shown in panel @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> the compressibility also changes abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a bulk modulus ( @xmath27 ) jump across the transition of @xmath28 gpa . the structural transition into the collapsed phase </S>",
    "<S> is also accompanied with a magnetic to non - magnetic transition in which the magnetic moment at the iron site drops from @xmath29 to zero . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the low pressure tetragonal phase , the ct phase is far from any magnetic instability ( we could not converge to any magnetic solution ) , in agreement with the experimental observation of no spin - fluctuations in th ct - phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the observed phenomenology of the o - ct phase transition , that is correctly captured by the dft - gga .    </S>",
    "<S> we switch now to the description of doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , focusing our interest on those systems that experimentally show enhanced superconducting properties .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the main experimental evidences reported in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> is the observation of a clear discontinuity on the variation of the lattice constants ( @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) as a function of the temperature for 15% doped praseodymium , pure cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  and 8% doped neodymium ( but not in lanthanum doped ) .    in order to predict the structural changes upon chemical doping and to understand the experimental results </S>",
    "<S> , we simulated the partial chemical substitution at the ca site with three different dopants : isovalent ( sr and eu ) , aliovalent with trivalent electron - dopants re ( the experimentally realized case la , ce , pr , nd and the not yet realized pm and sm ) and hole - doping with alkali na , k , rb . </S>",
    "<S> the doping level is fixed to x=25% , well within the experimentally realized doping range in cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we performed structural optimization at different volumes in both non - magnetic and antiferromagnetic ( stripe ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> phase stability was calculated comparing enthalpy curves as a function of the external pressure . </S>",
    "<S> structural , electronic and magnetic properties are collected in tab .  </S>",

    "<S> .structural electronic and magnetic properties of m doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 ( gpa ) is the transition pressure of the structural collapse . @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are the equilibrium volumes in each phase , @xmath34 ( mev / f.u . ) </S>",
    "<S> is the energy difference between the two phases at zero pressure . @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath36 ) represents the magnetic moment in the o phase . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the characteristic transition pressure p@xmath11 from the orthorhombic to the collapsed tetragonal phase as obtained in the pure cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  is strongly affected by the chemical substitution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , ce , pr , nd , pm and sm are stable in the collapsed phase already at ambient ( zero ) pressure , while a positive pressure is needed to induce a collapse in sr , eu , la , na , k and rb substituted systems . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in excellent agreement with the available experimental data reported by saha and coworkers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , pr is reported to induce the structural collapse already at a concentration between 5% and 7.5% ; nd is collapsed at 8% of doping , while no collapse is reported by la doping up to 27% of doping . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we nicely predict the existence of the ct phase at 2.24 gpa in sr doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 as experimentally observed@xcite .    on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , ce is not observed in the collapsed tetragonal phase up to a 22% of content , contrary with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> however , ce was predicted to be at the boundary of the phase transition , in fact we find the collapsed phase only very slightly more stable than the o phase by 0.7 mev / f.u . and is sufficient a tiny positive pressure to induce it ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the crystal structure upon doping and pressure is reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure ] . </S>",
    "<S> the data from the simulations on the two phases have been connected with a spline fit jumping at the calculated transition pressure . </S>",
    "<S> lattice constants , as a function of pressure , show the characteristic drop of the @xmath4-axis ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure](a ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> an excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental lattice parameters ( not shown ) is observed when comparing the low - temperature experimental lattice constants@xcite with the calculated ones in the non - magnetic tetragonal phase ( ct ) , confirming the validity of dft in the description of this phase . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature phase is a magnetic ( probably paramagnetic tetragonal ) phase , whose description is improved , within dft - gga , including magnetic polarization of the fe sites .    </S>",
    "<S> the internal relaxation shows an interesting pressure dependence of the fe - as interlayer distance ( @xmath23 ) . in the o phase it decreases monotonically with the applied pressure while it becomes constant and material independent in the ct phase ( as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure](d ) ) . due to this feature in this second phase the lattice parameter @xmath4 depends only on the size of the impurity atom and can be considered a measure of its ionic radius in this class of compounds .    </S>",
    "<S> being originated by the formation of as - as bond , the phase transition to the collapsed phase happens when the interlayer as - as separation ( @xmath24 ) reaches the critical value of 3.0  ( about twice the as covalent radius)@xcite , independently of the dopant ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure](b ) ) . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> this last result is confirmed by x - rays diffraction measurements of saha and coworkers which suggested@xcite that the key parameter that controls the collapse is the as - as distance .    </S>",
    "<S> then , if we look at the correlation between the @xmath4 lattice parameter ( in the ct phase ) and the transition pressure p@xmath11 , we find a very interesting correlation . </S>",
    "<S> for all trivalent lanthanides the transition pressure scales linearly with the value of the @xmath4 lattice ( @xmath37 with the ionic size ) . the same happens for bivalent and mono - valent dopants , although with different linear coefficients , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : c_p ] .    </S>",
    "<S> this clearly tells that p@xmath11 is determined by the size of the impurity atom and the kind and level of doping , with electron doping favoring the ct transition ;    in fact , a smaller ionic size favors the structural collapse because when as atoms get closer their interaction becomes stronger and the required pressure to induce the o - ct transition is low ( or zero ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the valence of the dopant , on the other hand , also affects the transition pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the hole doping induced by the alkali is mainly located inside the fe - as layer , not affecting sensibly the as - as vertical bonding energy , while electron doping fills the as - as bonding states , favoring the chemical bonding . to support this picture we plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bands](a ) the periodic part of two states belonging to the same electronic band but taken above and below the fermi energy ( indicated in figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interlayer bonding character is stronger above than below , therefore while electron doping contributes to the interlayer bonding , hole doping affects it only to a little extent .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we switch to the second part of our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the electronic properties and their doping dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the non - magnetic band structure of undoped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  in the bct unit cell is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bands](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that both o ( not shown ) and ct phases show a depletion of states at the fermi energy , with respect to this non - magnetic high - temperature phase . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> this is due to a magnetic splitting , while in the latter to chemical splitting of bonding and antibonding @xmath38 state in as .    considering the o phase , the electronic effects of aliovalent atoms </S>",
    "<S> can not be predicted by means of a rigid band approximation because of the doping dependence of the magnetic moment ( see tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : data ] ) , that strongly affects the band structure near the fermi energy . on the other hand in the ct phases of all the investigated systems ( near the critical lattice constants ) a rigid shift of the fermi level reproduces </S>",
    "<S> very well the dopant induced modifications of the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen comparing the dos of different compounds as shown in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bands ] .    thus , apart from a small ( @xmath39 ev ) rigid shift of the fermi level , the non - magnetic band structure of the compressed tetragonal phase of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bands ] ) is a good approximation for that of ( superconducting ) re - doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the structural collapse induced by the dopants profoundly changes the topology of the fermi surface with respect to the non - magnetic tetragonal phase as it does in undoped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional , cylindrical , hole fs s at the @xmath40 point disappear upon compression and three dimensional fs appear as a consequence of band crossing the fermi energy along the @xmath40-@xmath41 direction of the brillouin zone . thus , in the ct phase it is very difficult to recognize the characteristic topology of fs common to other pnictides superconductors , and that are thought to be the basic ingredient of the sc pairing ( namely the nearly nested cylindrical fermi surfaces ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the magnetic moment of fe site is predicted to be completely quenched in the ct as recently confirmed by nmr @xmath42 as spectra in pr doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  @xcite .    a possible scenario to reconcile the theoretical description and </S>",
    "<S> the experimental evidences could be the same proposed by proks and coworkers@xcite to explain the superconducting phase in pure cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  under pressure : superconductivity can exist because of the formation of a new tetragonal phase ( stabilized by chemical and/or strain / non - hydrostatic effects ) which prevents both the magnetic and the structural phase transition , then retaining the characteristic electronic properties that makes it unstable toward superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we , thus , call for further experiments aimed to characterize the electronic , magnetic and structural properties of these new superconductors , in order to elucidate the nature of the non - collapsed tetragonal phase    within the parameter - free dft - gga computational framework we explain the observed low - temperature and pressure phase transitions observed experimentally in re - doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3  and we predict , giving a rationale , the pressure dependent structural trends .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that , when realized , the low temperature ct phases induced by re substitutions are indeed non - magnetic , with electronic band structures sharing the same features of the band structure of the ct phase of pure cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic features promoting the superconducting phase are missing . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the superconducting instability , if it is confirmed to be present in the compressed phases of re - doped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 seems to open a new chapter in the physics of iron - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however a scenario that we find more likely is that superconductivity appears in a non collapsed subphases as it was suggested by proes and coworkers for undoped cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 . </S>"
