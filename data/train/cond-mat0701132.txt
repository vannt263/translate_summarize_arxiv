    "it is well known that the fundamental solution ( or _ green function _ ) for the cauchy problem of the linear diffusion equation can be interpreted as a gaussian ( normal ) probability density function ( @xmath0 ) in space , evolving in time .",
    "all the moments of this @xmath0 are finite ; in particular , its variance is proportional to the first power of time , a noteworthy property of the _ standard diffusion_. in this paper we illustrate via fractional calculus two types of generalization of this cauchy problem .",
    "one type uses the fractional derivative in the sense of riemann and liouville ( r - l ) , the other in the sense of caputo ( c ) . in its uses",
    "we distinguish between single and distributed orders of fractional derivatives . specifically , we work out how to express their fundamental solutions in terms of an integral of laplace type suitable for a numerical evaluation .",
    "particular attention is devoted to the time evolution of the variance for the r - l and c cases .",
    "it is known that for large times the variance characterizes the type of anomalous diffusion .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we write down the two general forms of the time - fractional diffusion equation with distributed - order with r - l and c derivatives and the fourier - laplace representation of the corresponding fundamental solution . for this purpose",
    "we need to introduce a positive function @xmath1 that acts as a discrete or continuous distribution of orders .",
    "in addition to the particular case of a single order @xmath2 with @xmath3 , we consider two case - studies for the fractional diffusion of distributed order : as a discrete distribution we take two distinct orders @xmath4 with @xmath5 ; as continuous distribution we take the uniform density of orders between zero and 1 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the time evolution of the variance which is obtained from the fourier - laplace representation of the corresponding fundamental solution , by inverting only the laplace transform . in the single order case",
    "we recover the sub - diffusion power - law common to the r - l and c forms ; for the cases of distributed order we find a remarkable difference between the two forms , well visible from their asymptotic expressions for small and large times . in section 4",
    "we illustrate our method to get the fundamental solutions from their fourier - laplace transforms , following the strategy of carrying out at first the fourier inversion and then the laplace inversion .",
    "we find instructive to show the graphical representation of the fundamental solutions ( in space at fixed times ) .",
    "for the case of fractional diffusion of single order , because of the self - similarity of the solutions we limit ourselves to show plots of the corresponding solutions at a fixed time @xmath6 versus @xmath7 .",
    "for the two case - studies of fractional relaxation of distributed order , because the self - similarity of the solutions is lost , we provide plots of the corresponding solutions versus @xmath7 at three fixed times , selected as @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 , contrasting the different evolution for the r - l and the c form , in a moderate space - range .",
    "we can note how the time evolution of the solution in the considered spatial range depends on the different time - asymptotic behaviour of the variance for the two forms .",
    "finally , concluding remarks are given in section 5 . in order to have a self - contained mathematical treatment",
    "we have added three appendices : the appendix a is devoted to the basic notions of fractional calculus , whereas appendices b and c deal with functions of mittag - leffler and exponential integral type , respectively , in view of their relevance for our treatment .",
    "the _ standard diffusion equation _ , that in re - scaled non - dimensional variables reads @xmath10 with @xmath11 as the field variable , can be generalized by using the notion of fractional derivative of distributed order in time . for this purpose",
    "we need to consider a function @xmath1 that acts as weight for the order of differentiation @xmath12 $ ] such that @xmath13 the positive constant @xmath14 can be taken as 1 if we like to assume the normalization condition for the integral .",
    "clearly , some special conditions of regularity and behaviour near the boundaries will be required for the weight function @xmath1 we conveniently require that its primitive @xmath15 vanishes at @xmath16 and is there continuous from the right , attains the value @xmath14 at @xmath17 and has at most finitely many ( upwards ) jump points in the half - open interval @xmath18 , these jump points allowing delta contributions to @xmath1 ( particularly relevant for discrete distributions of orders ) . ] .",
    "such function , that can be referred to as the _ order density _ if @xmath19 , is allowed to have @xmath20-components if we are interested in a discrete distribution of orders .",
    "there are two possible forms of generalization depending if we use fractional derivatives intended in the r - l or c sense .",
    "correspondingly we obtain the _ time - fractional diffusion equation of distributed order _ in the two forms : @xmath21\\,d\\beta     \\ , , \\q    x\\in \\rr , \\ ; t\\ge 0\\ , , \\eqno(2.3a)\\ ] ] and @xmath22 \\ , d\\beta \\ ,     = \\frac{\\d^2   } { \\d x^2 }    \\,u_*(x , t)\\ , , \\q   x\\in \\rr , \\ ; t\\ge 0\\ , .",

    "( 2.3a)-(2.3b ) so we understand that these equations are subjected to the initial condition @xmath23 .",
    "since for distributed order the solution depends on the selected form ( as we shall show hereafter ) , we now distinguish the two fractional equations and their fundamental solutions by decorating in the caputo case the variable @xmath11 with subscript @xmath24 as it is customary for the notation of the corresponding derivative .",
    "diffusion equations of distributed order of both types have been recently discussed by several authors : in particular we find the c form e.g. in whereas the r - l form e.g. in @xcite . in some papers",
    "the authors have referred to the c and r - l forms as to _ normal _ and _ modified _ forms of the time - fractional diffusion equation of distributed order , respectively . for a thorough general study of fractional pseudo - differential equations of distributed order let us cite the paper by umarov and gorenflo @xcite . for a relationship with the continuous random walk models we may refer to the paper by gorenflo and mainardi @xcite .",
    "the fundamental solutions for the time - fractional diffusion equations ( 2.3a)-(2.3b ) can be obtained by applying in sequence the fourier and laplace transforms to them .",
    "we write , for generic functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , these transforms as follows : @xmath27 then , in the fourier - laplace domain our cauchy problems [ with @xmath28 , after applying formulas for the laplace transform appropriate to the r - l and c fractional derivatives , see ( a.8 ) and ( a.9 ) , and observing @xmath29 , see e.g. @xcite , appear in the two forms @xmath30 \\ ,",

    "( 2.6a ) and ( 2.6b ) provide the same result @xmath42 this is consistent with the well - known result according to which the two forms are equivalent for the single order case .",
    "however , for a generic order distribution , the fourier - laplace representations ( 2.6a ) ( 2.6b ) are different so they produce in the space - time domain different fundamental solutions , that however are interrelated in some way in view of the transformation ( 2.7 ) .",
    "before trying to get the fundamental solutions in the space - time domain to be obtained by a double inversion of the fourier - laplace transforms , it is worth to outline the expressions of their second moment ( the variance ) since these can be derived from eqs .",
    "( 2.6a)-(2.6b ) by a single laplace inversion , as it is shown hereafter .",
    "we recall that the time evolution of the variance is relevant for classifying the type of diffusion .",
    "denoting for the two forms @xmath43 we easily recognize that @xmath44 as a consequence we need to invert only laplace transforms taking into account the behaviour of the fourier transform for @xmath45 near zero .",

    "we shall now concentrate our interest to some typical choices for the weight function @xmath51 that characterizes the time - fractional diffusion equations of distributed order ( 2.3a ) and ( 2.3b ) .",
