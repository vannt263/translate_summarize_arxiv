    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) dominate the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function in the nearby universe ( @xmath9 * ? ? ? * ) and are known to host both starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , frequently in the same system . a variety of observational evidence  such as double nuclei",
    ", starburst activity and disturbed morphologies  suggests that most lirgs ( @xmath10l@xmath7 ) are gas - rich disk galaxies that are undergoing strong interactions or mergers .",
    "the most luminous systems , ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , have quasar - like luminosities ( @xmath11l@xmath7 ) and all appear to be advanced mergers ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "much observational and theoretical work has established that mergers of gas - rich galaxies play a key role in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : tidal torques generated by the merger drive gas into the galaxy core(s ) , triggering starbursts and fueling embedded agn .",
    "it has been proposed that in this scenario , `` cool '' , starburst dominated ( u)lirgs evolve into `` warm '' , agn - dominated ulirgs as the circum - nuclear dust is dispersed by starburst and agn - induced outflows @xcite .    however , the role of galaxy mergers in triggering agn remains uncertain .",
    "there is increasing evidence that major mergers only trigger the most luminous agn , while less luminous agns seem to be driven by secular processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , in their study of 62 ulirgs , @xcite found no correlation between merger stage and evidence of agn activity , suggesting that an agn - dominated system is not an inevitable outcome of a gas rich merger and that ulirg evolution is strongly affected by the available gas mass and the individual structures of the progenitor galaxies .",
    "approximately 20% of ( u)lirgs contain extremely luminous oh masers , emitting primarily in the 1667 and 1665mhz lines with luminosities @xmath12l@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in the most recent and well - developed models , this oh megamaser ( ohm ) emission is produced by amplification of a background radio continuum source by clumps of molecular gas , with inverted level populations arising from pumping by far infra - red ( fir ; @xmath13 m ) radiation from dust heated by a starburst and/or an embedded agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . as they are found in gas - rich mergers ,",
    "it has been suggested that ohms can be used to trace galaxy merger rates and associated processes ( dust obscured star formation and black hole growth ) over a wide redshift range ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , studies of local oh megamaser galaxies ( ohmg ) seem likely to provide important insights into processes occurring in gas - rich mergers .",
    "thus , it has been argued that ohm emission requires exceptionally high concentrations of dense molecular gas , perhaps associated with a temporal spike in tidally driven gas inflow @xcite . in some individual ohmgs",
    ", detailed interferometric mapping studies have found that the oh masers arise in dense , edge - on rotating molecular gas disks or rings on scales @xmath14pc , which have been identified as compact starburst rings in some objects @xcite , or in others as the circum - nuclear torii @xcite hypothesized by the unified scheme for agn @xcite .",
    "in addition , the oh lines often show broad asymmetric profiles and velocity shifts suggestive of outflows , particularly in systems containing optically identified agn @xcite , perhaps indicating that starburst or agn - driven outflows are clearing away enshrouding , dense molecular material .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed multiwavelength study of iras16399 - 0937 , a spectacular but relatively little studied interacting galaxy pair at a redshift @xmath15 .",
    "it is both a lirg ( @xmath16l@xmath7 ) and an ohmg ( @xmath17l@xmath7 ) .",
    "the ohm emission has a flux @xmath18 wm@xmath19 , with a peak flux density at 1.6  ghz of @xmath20mjy @xcite .",
    "morphologically , iras16399 - 0937 is a mid - to - late stage merger , with a double nucleus situated in a common envelope @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified the northern nucleus ( denoted iras16399n , hereafter ) as a liner ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the southern nucleus ( denoted iras16399s , hereafter ) as a starburst , based on the optical emission line ratios @xcite .",
    "therefore , iras16399 - 0937 appears to contain both an agn and a starburst in a merging system , making it a good system in which to study the relative importance of star formation and black hole accretion in powering the ir emission .",
    "our study is based on new hst imaging observations and an analysis of archival spitzer , herschel and vla data .",

    "given that the b - band ( f435w ) and h@xmath0+[nii ] emission trace , respectively , young stars and hii regions , it is clear that recent or ongoing ( and relatively unobscured ) star formation , while concentrated in the structures mentioned above , is widespread across the envelope over scales of several kpc .",

    "it is also notable that the foreground extinction to the ism component is greatly increased in the fit without the torus component , @xmath200 , compared to @xmath201 with the torus .",

    "any of these alternative ionization mechanism could plausibly be operating at some level in the iras16399n nucleus of iras16399 - 0937 , but given that gravitational torques are expected to drive gas flows in merging systems , shock ionization seems the most likely candidate .",
    "indeed , inspection of the shock model grids presented by @xcite reveals that models including a photoionized precursor match the [ oiii]/h@xmath49 , [ oi]/h@xmath0 , [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratios reported by @xcite and @xcite remarkably well for shock velocities @xmath237kms@xmath5 .",
    "such shock velocities are comparable with radial inflow velocities found in gas dynamical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , @xcite found that extended emission line regions in several ulirgs have liner - like ionization conditions consistent with shock ionization , which they attribute to shocks associated with merger - driven gas flows .",
    "curiously , therefore , the results of the sed fitting support the presence of an agn in the iras16399n nucleus , but also suggest that the liner spectrum , upon which the original classification was based , is not due to agn photoionization .",
    "the case of iras16399n exemplifies the point that a liner spectrum does not necessarily indicate the presence of an agn . as 22.5% and 42% of the ohmgs studied by ,",
    "respectively , @xcite and @xcite were spectroscopically classified as liners , misinterpretation of these objects as agn may partly explain the discrepancy between the high agn fraction inferred in ohmg from optical spectroscopy ( @xmath170% ) and the much lower estimates obtained from radio , mid - ir and x - ray studies ( 10  30% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth noting , however , that @xcite have recently argued that most previous liner identifications in ( u)lirgs should be reclassified as composite starburst / agn systems , based on the refined optical classification scheme introduced by @xcite .",
    "they conclude that `` true '' liners ( in the sense of low accretion rate agn ) rarely occur in ir luminous mergers .",
    "the iras16399n nucleus of iras16399 - 0937 is one of only 9 objects that are classified as liners in their sample of @xmath238 ( u)lirgs .",
    "nevertheless , as it falls near the seyfert - liner boundary in the vo diagrams , @xcite suggest that it may be a seyfert , or an intermediate object .",
    "conversely , our results suggest that the liner spectrum originates from shock ionization and therefore is not directly related to the deeply embedded agn .      taking the black hole masses ( @xmath47m@xmath7 ) derived from the @xcite relation at face value",
    ", the inferred agn luminosity ( @xmath239ergs@xmath5 ) implies a small eddington ratio @xmath240 ; where @xmath241ergs@xmath5 is the eddington luminosity . the black hole in the iras16399n nucleus is therefore accreting at well below the eddington rate , while , as there is no evidence for an agn in the iras16399s nucleus , its black hole is presumably accreting at an even lower rate .",
    "similarly , the star formation rates in both nuclei are relatively modest ( @xmath1 3 - 12 m@xmath7yr@xmath5 ) and the bulk of the current star formation ( @xmath242% ) is occurring in extended regions throughout the iras16399 - 0937 system . evidently the merger , while triggering widespread star formation has not ( yet ) resulted in the massive gas inflows that would lead to vigorous nuclear starbursts and enhanced bh accretion .    in the case of iras16399 - 0937 , therefore , the ohm emission does not appear to be associated with a transient enhancement in tidally driven gas inflows , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we have presented a multi - wavelength study of the luminous infrared galaxy iras16399 - 0937 .",
    "this system is a gas rich , mid - stage merger containing an oh megamaser and consisting of two nuclei separated by @xmath243kpc , situated in a common envelope . in previous works ,",
    "the nuclei have been classified on the basis of optical emission line ratios as a liner ( iras16399n ) and a starburst ( iras16399s ) , respectively .",
    "the data set analyzed here combines new emission line ( h@xmath0+[nii ] ) and broad - band ( fr914 m , f814w ) imaging obtained with the hst acs wide field camera with archival imaging and spectroscopy in the optical ( hst acs f435w ) , near infrared ( hst nicmos 1.6@xmath28 m , 2mass j and k ) , mid / far - infrared ( spitzer irac , irs and mips ) , sub - mm ( herschel spire ) and radio ( 1.49 and 4.9 ghz vla ) . the main results from this analysis are summarized below :    * the hst images reveal a complex system of dust lanes and emission line knots and filaments . aside from the two nuclei ,",
    "the main morphological features are a large ( @xmath40kpc ) , diffuse region of star formation extending north and east of the iras16399n nucleus and an arc - like structure , also including star formation regions ( as traced by h@xmath0+[nii ] line emission and b - band continuum ) curving around the western side of the system , which connects the iras16399s nucleus to the ne diffuse region . an extensive dust lane complex running e - w separates the nuclei while the iras16399n nucleus itself is crossed by a dust lane oriented se - ne .",
    "* pah emission at 8@xmath28 m occupies the interior of envelope , with bright peaks corresponding to the two nuclei and spurs associated with the ne diffuse region and the dust lane complex e of the nuclei .",
    "the extended radio source morphology is very similar to that of the pah emission , suggesting that it is due to star formation .",
    "similarly , we find that the radio core associated with the iras16399n nucleus has a spectral index ( @xmath244 ) and brightness temperature ( @xmath245k ) consistent with star formation rather than an agn jet , in agreement with @xcite s earlier classification . *",
    "star formation activity is widespread throughout the system but mostly heavily obscured .",
    "the star formation rate for the system as a whole as derived from radio and ir luminosities is @xmath246m@xmath247/yr , a factor @xmath248 greater than the rate obtained from the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the two nuclei together account for only @xmath249% of the total .",
    "although the two nuclei have similar stellar masses ( as indicated by their h - band luminosities ) , the iras16399n nucleus is brighter in both pah and radio , indicating a higher star formation rate . * the spitzer irs spectrum ( 5.2 - 37@xmath28 m ) of the whole system",
    "is characterized by deep silicate absorption , pah emission features , vibrational lines of h@xmath70 and ionic lines from species of moderate ionization potential ( ip@xmath25050ev ) such as [ arii ] , [ neiii ] and [ siii ] .",
    "absorption bands of water ice ( 6.0@xmath28 m ) and hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( 6.85 and 7.25@xmath28 m ) are also present .",
    "the higher spatial resolution in sl mode also allows separate extractions in the wavelength range 5.2 ",
    "14@xmath28 m for the two nuclei and for several locations along the slit sampling the ism of the extended envelope .",
    "the two nuclei show similar spectral features but the iras16399n nucleus exhibits the deepest ice and hac absorption bands and is distinguished by a steeply rising continuum at wavelengths @xmath251 m .",
    "the h@xmath70o and hac bands indicate the presence of compact and cold material , while the steep continuum is likely due to warm dust from an agn - heated torus .",
    "however , we do not detect the high ionization fine structure lines ( e.g. , [ nev]14.3@xmath28 m ) , that are widely regarded as tracers of agn activity , in either nucleus .",
    "in general , the ism mid - ir spectra in the 5.2 - 14@xmath28 m band show prominent pah features , but the h@xmath70o and hac absorption bands and ionic emission lines are weaker or absent .",
    "* decomposition of the optical  fir sed of the two nuclei of iras16399 - 0937 into stellar , dusty ism and agn torus components confirms the presence of a moderately luminous agn ( @xmath239ergs@xmath5 ) in the iras16399n nucleus .",
    "however , the torus parameters recovered from the fit indicate that the agn is completely embedded in a quasi - spherical distribution of optically thick clumps .",
    "this structure has a covering factor close to unity , implying that only a very small fraction ( @xmath234% ) of the photons produced by the agn escape .",
    "the sed fits are consistent with star formation rates of @xmath252 and 3m@xmath7yr@xmath5 for the iras16399n and iras16399s nucleus , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with that inferred from the x - ray emission and are ( within a factor @xmath253 ) of the sfr s derived from the ism pah - dust 8@xmath28 m emission and the radio emission . however , if the agn torus is omitted from the sed model , the sfr inferred for iras16399n increases to @xmath120m@xmath7yr@xmath5 , which is comparable with the value determined for the entire system .",
    "the properties of the clumpy `` torus '' are consistent with the conditions required for strong , radiatively pumped oh maser emission . *",
    "the small fraction of ionizing photons that escapes the torus is insufficient to produce the observed h@xmath0 luminosity from the iras16399n nucleus by a factor @xmath254 .",
    "it follows that the liner emission line spectrum can not be attributed to agn photoionization .",
    "we propose instead that the line emission from the iras16399n nucleus is due to shocks with velocities @xmath237kms@xmath5 , perhaps associated with gas flows induced by gravitational torques generated by the merger . *",
    "if the iras16399n nucleus follows the @xcite scaling relationship between h - band luminosity and black hole mass , the luminosity derived for the embedded agn implies that the @xmath255m@xmath7 black hole is accreting at a small fraction ( @xmath105% ) of the eddington rate .",
    "as the star formation rates in both nuclei are also relatively modest , it seems clear that the massive gas inflows predicted by merger simulations have yet to fully develop in this system .",
    "the picture that emerges of iras16399 - 0937 is that of a gas - rich merger of mass ratio @xmath256 .",
    "the merger has triggered widespread star formation but massive gas flows into the still distinct nuclei have not yet fully developed .",
    "the iras16399n nucleus harbors an embedded agn of relatively modest luminosity and is also the likely source of the oh megamaser emission , while the iras16399s nucleus is starburst dominated .",
    "the agn is apparent almost entirely through the contribution of agn - heated dust to the ir sed .",
    "the liner optical spectrum upon which the original classification was based is probably due to shocks , rather than agn photoionization .",
    "this work also highlights the value of multiwavelength data and spatial resolution in establishing the nature of the buried power sources in ( u)lirgs ."
