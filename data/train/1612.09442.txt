    "examples of a single law of motion are : the sedov expansion in the presence of a circumstellar medium ( csm ) with constant density where the radius , @xmath2 , scales as @xmath3 , see @xcite , and the momentum conservation in the framework of the thin layer approximation with csm at constant density where @xmath4 , see @xcite .",
