    "supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) reside at the centers of most large galaxies .",
    "the masses of these sbhs are tightly correlated with the luminosity @xcite , mass @xcite , and velocity dispersions @xcite of the spheroidal components of their host galaxies .",
    "large galaxies form hierarchically from the merger of smaller galaxies , and sbh mergers are expected to accompany the mergers of their hosts .",
    "the final stages of these sbh mergers are driven by the emission of copious amounts of gravitational radiation .",
    "conservation of linear momentum implies that the final black holes produced in sbh mergers must recoil with linear momentum equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of the anisotropically emitted gravitational radiation .",
    "early estimates of these gravitational recoils or `` kicks '' using post - newtonian ( pn ) techniques @xcite and black - hole perturbation theory @xcite suggested that they would not exceed several hundred km / s in magnitude .",
    "more recently , progress in numerical relativity ( nr ) @xcite has allowed relativists to simulate the mergers of highly spinning , comparable - mass black holes . for non - spinning binaries , ensuing studies identified a maximum recoil of @xmath2 @xcite",
    ". simulations of spinning black holes , however , resulted in one of the greatest surprises of numerical relativity ; for equal - mass binaries with opposite spins in the orbital plane gravitational recoils can approach 4,000 km / s @xcite , greater than the escape velocity of even the most massive galaxies .",
    "this theoretical result seems at first difficult to reconcile with observations indicating that almost all large galaxies host sbhs .",
    "one solution to this problem is to align the sbh spins before merger into configurations that lead to small recoils .",
    "gravitational radiation extracts energy and angular momentum from the orbit of the binary sbhs , causing them to merge on a timescale @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the binary separation .",
    "this timescale becomes longer than the age of the universe at separations @xmath5  pc , implying that some mechanism other than gravitational radiation is required to escort the sbhs to this separation ( the `` final - parsec problem '' ) @xcite .",
    "one such mechanism is the transfer of orbital angular momentum from the sbh binary to surrounding gas .",
    "this gas forms a circumbinary disk about the sbhs , and can be transferred through the gap onto accretion disks about the individual sbhs @xcite .",
    "if the angular momentum of the circumbinary disk is misaligned with the sbh spins , the lense - thirring effect causes inclined annuli in the individual accretion disks to differentially precess about the sbh spins .",
    "bardeen and petterson @xcite showed that viscous dissipation causes this differentially precessing gas to settle into the equatorial planes of the sbhs . on longer timescales , these warped accretion disks torque the sbh spins into alignment with the orbital angular momentum of the gas at large radii , presumably that of the circumbinary disk from which both accretion disks are being fed @xcite .",
    "bogdanovi et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that this alignment could reduce gravitational recoils to less than 200  km / s , in contrast to the @xmath6  km / s recoils expected for sbhs in the `` superkick '' configuration ( spins in opposite directions lying in the equatorial plane ) @xcite .",
    "dotti et al .",
    "@xcite tested this suggestion by performing a series of n - body smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of two @xmath7 sbhs inspiraling due to dynamical friction exerted by a @xmath8 circumnuclear disk in their orbital plane .",
    "one of the sbhs began at the center of the circumnuclear disk , while the second sbh spiraled inwards from an initial separation of 50  pc to a final separation of @xmath9  pc .",
    "gas particles within the bondi - hoyle radii @xcite of the sbhs were accreted , and assumed to fuel warped accretion disks as described in perego et al . @xcite .",
    "on a timescale of @xmath10  1 - 2  myr , the sbh spins became aligned to within @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) of their orbital angular momentum for a cold ( hot ) circumnuclear disk @xcite .",
    "if the partially aligned spin configurations found in these simulations were preserved as the sbhs inspiraled and merged , the median recoils predicted by nr simulations would be @xmath13  km / s for dimensionless spins @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) with an initially uniform distribution of magnitudes @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the assumption that sbh spin distributions remain unchanged between @xmath17 ( where the sph simulations end ) and @xmath18 ( where the nr simulations begin ) , needs further examination . here",
    "@xmath19 is the schwarzschild radius of a sbh of mass @xmath20 . because of the steep scaling @xmath21 mentioned previously , the sbhs decouple from their circumbinary disk and spiral inwards purely under the influence of gravitational radiation at a binary separation @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the total mass of the binary .",
    "schnittman @xcite integrated pn equations of motion and spin precession from an initial binary separation @xmath24 to a final separation @xmath25 ( in geometrical units where @xmath26 ) and discovered that partially aligned sbh spin distributions during this portion of the inspiral are strongly influenced by the presence of spin - orbit resonances .",
    "these resonances are special spin configurations in which both sbh spins and the orbital angular momentum jointly precess at the same frequency in a common two - dimensional plane . for binary sbhs with mass ratio @xmath27 and",
    "dimensionless spins @xmath14 , at each separation @xmath4 there exist two one - parameter families of spin - orbit resonances : one with @xmath28 and the other with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the angle between the components of @xmath31 and @xmath32 perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum @xmath33 .",
    "the first of these families ( @xmath34 ) has @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , while the second family ( @xmath29 ) has @xmath37 . as sbhs inspiral due to the emission of gravitational radiation ,",
    "they can become captured into nearby spin - orbit resonances , substantially altering the sbh spin distributions between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    in previous work , we examined the influence of this pn portion of the inspiral on the expected distribution of sbh final spins @xcite and recoils @xcite .",
    "we found that if the spin of the more massive sbh was more closely aligned with the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath35 ) , the sbhs were more likely to be captured into the @xmath34 family of resonances .",
    "this alignment of the sbh spins prior to merger causes them to add constructively , enhancing the spin of the final black hole .",
    "symmetry requirements imply that gravitational recoils are suppressed when the sbh spins are aligned with each other prior to merger @xcite , so this pn alignment also reduces the predicted distribution of recoils .",
    "the opposite is true when @xmath37 ; sbhs are preferentially captured into the @xmath29 family of resonances , reducing the final spins and enhancing the gravitational recoils .",
    "recent equal - mass nr simulations by lousto and zlochower ( @xcite ; henceforth lz ) have qualitatively and quantitatively changed the predicted dependence of gravitational recoils on the sbh spins @xmath14 .",
    "the maximum possible kick , extrapolated to maximal initial spins , is now @xmath40  km / s , and this kick occurs not in the previously described `` superkick '' configuration but for spins with @xmath41 . in light of these new findings , it is worth investigating whether pn spin alignment still has as dramatic an effect on the expected recoil distribution as we found previously .",
    "this investigation is the subject of this paper . in section",
    "[ s : pn ] we revisit our analysis of how pn evolution affects binaries that are evolved from an initial separation of @xmath42 down to a final separation of @xmath25 .",
    "we clarify the reason why spin - orbit resonances are also effective at suppressing kicks consistent with the new lz results . in section  [ s",
    ": param ] we set up a more extensive set of monte carlo simulations of sbh inspirals .",
    "we focus on a specific choice for the initial distribution of sbh parameters @xmath43 , and justify this choice based on astrophysical considerations . in section  [ s : res ]",
    "we present the final distributions of recoil velocities resulting from our monte carlo simulations , and our predictions for the fraction of remnant sbhs that are ejected from their host galaxies .",
    "we summarize these results and discuss the sources of uncertainty in our analysis in section  [ s : disc ] .",
    "the recent lz simulations @xcite have two potentially important consequences from an astrophysical point of view .",
    "first of all , the maximum possible `` hang - up '' kick magnitude is about 25% larger than predicted by the ordinary , `` no hang - up '' superkick formula : 4,900  km / s rather than 3,750  km / s .",
    "secondly , the largest kick occurs for a configuration in which the spins are partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum . because of the gas - dynamical alignment arguments summarized above , this configuration seems more likely than the superkick configuration .",
    "we would therefore expect an enhancement in the statistical likelihood of gravitational recoils ejecting remnant sbhs from galaxies as reported by lz .",
    "we confirm this enhancement , but show that even in hang - up kick scenarios spin - orbit resonances can significantly change the likelihood of large recoil velocities as the sbhs inspiral from sub - parsec scales to about @xmath44 .",
    "the largest `` superkick '' recoil velocities are obtained for nearly equal - mass sbhs .",
    "furthermore , the lz kick formula is most reliable for mass ratios close to unity , since all 48 of the new nr simulations were carried out for @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we therefore begin our study of the likelihood of very large kicks by considering comparable - mass binaries .",
    "resonance effects are not present for @xmath46 , but astrophysical binaries are not expected to be precisely equal in mass .",
    "for this reason we have performed monte carlo pn evolutions of 900 black hole binaries with mass ratio close to but not exactly equal to one ( we choose @xmath47 to facilitate comparisons with schnittman @xcite and our own earlier work @xcite ) .",
    "we considered binaries where the two black holes have the same dimensionless spin magnitude @xmath48 , and selected five equally - spaced values of @xmath49 in the range @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "for each of the five values of @xmath49 we further selected six equally - spaced initial values of @xmath51 in the range [ @xmath52 , @xmath12 ] and six values in the range [ @xmath54 , @xmath55 , for a total of sixty monte carlo simulations .",
    "each simulation is started by assuming uniform distributions in @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we begin at an initial separation @xmath58 and use the pn equations of motion to evolve the binaries down to a final separation @xmath59 ( cf .",
    "section  ii of @xcite for details of the pn evolution ) .",
    "to quantify the effect of pn spin alignment , we compute the recoil velocity distribution that would result from applying kick formulae to our binaries _ before _ the pn evolution ( at @xmath58 ) and close to merger ( at @xmath59 ) .",
    "we calculate the component @xmath60 of the recoil velocity parallel to @xmath33 using both the new lz `` hang - up '' formula @xcite and the older kick formula from campanelli et al . @xcite .",
    "we calculate the components @xmath61 , @xmath62 perpendicular to @xmath33 from the fitting formula of @xcite : cf .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite .",
    "we then compute the probability that the total recoil velocity is greater than @xmath63  km / s for each of our sixty monte carlo simulations ( twelve values of @xmath51 and five values of @xmath49 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath64 is comparable to the escape velocity from a giant elliptical galaxy @xcite ; we will consider more realistic escape velocities that depend on the host galaxy s mass in section  [ s : res ] .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : p1000 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : p1000 ] confirms lz s conclusion that the `` hang - up '' effect increases ejection probabilities if the spin of the heavier companion is partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath65 ) whereas the ejection probabilities are reduced for partial antialignment of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) ; cf .",
    "their fig .  2 .",
    "by comparing the dashed lines in the upper left and right panels of figure  [ fig : p1000 ] , we see that , if we ignore the effect of resonances ( as the authors of the lz papers did ) , ejection probabilities for the aligned cases @xmath68 are only mildly dependent on @xmath51 and roughly double because of the hang - up kick effect . these ejection probabilities can be larger than @xmath69 for spins @xmath70 and @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , a comparison of dashed and solid lines in each panel shows that ejection probabilities are dramatically reduced in the aligned case if we apply the kick formula ( as we should ) close to merger , rather than at large separations .",
    "the relevance of resonant effects depends on @xmath51 : if the initial angle between the larger black hole and the orbital angular momentum @xmath71 , recoil velocities larger than @xmath72  km / s would almost never occur . even for more modest alignments ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "such large kicks only occur for large values of @xmath49 .",
    "recoils are even smaller for @xmath74 , as all components of the kick are proportional to @xmath75 ( see eq .  ( 11 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "note that this kick suppression only applies when on average @xmath35 ; for initial values of @xmath37 the recoil is enhanced , not suppressed , as demonstrated by the lower two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : p1000 ] , where @xmath76 .",
    "interestingly , the kick enhancement appears to saturate : while ejection probabilities approach zero as we fix @xmath51 at ever smaller values , they are essentially independent of @xmath77 if we apply the kick formula close to merger .",
    "figure  [ fig : p1000 ] also indicates that kick suppression via alignment ( @xmath78 ) is more efficient than enhancement via antialignment ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we shall quantify this asymmetry in more detail below .",
    "it may seem surprising that pn spin alignment so dramatically suppresses the recoil velocities predicted by the new lz kick formula , since many of the spin - orbit resonances depicted in figure  1 of @xcite have values of @xmath80 comparable to that of the new `` maximum recoil '' configuration in the presence of the hang - up effect .",
    "we can understand the effectiveness of pn kick suppression by recognizing that it results from the alignment of the perpendicular components of the sbh spins _ with each other _",
    "( @xmath81 ) , not from the spins aligning with the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath82 , as bogdanovi et al .",
    "@xcite argued would occur due to the torque exerted by a warped circumbinary disk ) .    to illustrate this point , we consider maximally spinning ( @xmath83 ) binaries with @xmath47 in figure  [ fig : deltaphi ] .",
    "dotted histograms refer to recoil distributions computed before the pn evolutions ( at @xmath58 ) , and solid histograms refer to the corresponding distributions computed after evolving the binaries down to @xmath59 .",
    "let us first focus on the left panel .",
    "the black curves in the upper histogram show that black holes with isotropic spin distributions ( flat distributions in @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 ) maintain these isotropic distributions as they inspiral down to @xmath59 .",
    "the thick blue ( thin red ) curves in the upper histogram corresponds to the subset of this isotropic distribution with the 30% lowest ( highest ) initial values of @xmath51 .",
    "careful comparison of the solid and dotted curves reveals that recoils are suppressed ( enhanced ) for low ( high ) initial values of @xmath51 .",
    "this tendency is seen much more clearly in the middle and lower panels , where @xmath51 has the indicated initial value while @xmath32 retains its isotropic initial distribution .",
    "if @xmath87 is partially aligned with @xmath33 , as in the middle histograms , then @xmath88 ( the angle between the two spins ) and @xmath86 will be strongly peaked around @xmath89 at the end of the evolution and kicks will be reduced .",
    "if instead @xmath87 is partially antialigned with @xmath33 ( as in the lower histograms ) , then @xmath88 and @xmath86 will be strongly peaked around @xmath90 at the end of the evolution and the kicks will be enhanced ( cf . the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the crucial element for producing alignment here is the fact that @xmath91 .",

    "this nearly eliminates the kick suppression ( for initially aligned binaries ) or enhancement ( for initially anti - aligned binaries ) .",
    "we demonstrated in the previous section that the new fitting formulae for gravitational recoils provided in the lz papers @xcite did not alter our earlier conclusion @xcite that pn spin alignment can dramatically affect the distribution of recoil velocities for specific initial values of @xmath94 and @xmath51 and an initially isotropic distribution for @xmath32 . in this section",

    "the second sbh , also with @xmath194 , began at an initial separation of @xmath195  pc with orbital angular momentum that was already aligned or anti - aligned with that of the circumnuclear disk .",
    "this is consistent with the sph simulations of larwood and papaloizou @xcite , which suggest that the mass - quadrupole moment of the sbh binary will induce differential precession in an inclined circumbinary disk .",
    "viscous dissipation will then cause this differentially precessing disk to settle into the equatorial plane of the binary .",
    "it is unclear whether this mechanism will operate at the large initial separation of the dotti et al .",
    "simulations before the sbh binary becomes gravitationally bound .",
    "dynamical friction causes initially eccentric or retrograde orbits to circularize as the second sbh inspirals to a final separation @xmath196  pc .",

    "these simulations did not include star formation or cooling , and the internal energy of the gas particles was chosen to prevent gravitational fragmentation .",

    "accretion rates are generally higher for the less massive sbh , which is further from the center of mass and hence closer to the inner edge of the disk .",
    "this point is absolutely crucial for the pn spin alignment that is the subject of this paper , as it is the _ relative _ value of @xmath51 and @xmath197 that determines whether gravitational recoils are suppressed or enhanced .",
    "one might expect that the higher accretion rate onto the smaller sbh would lead to closer alignment between its spin and that of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the spin of the more massive sbh would be more influential in determining the direction of the warp in the circumbinary disk that torques the sbh spins .",
    "the relative value of @xmath51 and @xmath197 in the presence of a circumbinary disk remains very much an open question .",
    "a final complication is the growth of the binary s orbital eccentricity through its interaction with the circumbinary disk .",
    "although dynamical friction damped the orbital eccentricity at the large separations of the dotti et al .",
    "simulations @xcite , after the formation of a circumbinary disk the orbital eccentricity again grows to a limiting value @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "gravitational radiation circularizes the binary after it decouples from the circumbinary disk @xcite , but the binary could still have considerable residual eccentricity @xmath199 when the frequency of the fundamental gw harmonic reaches @xmath200  hz @xcite .",
    "we will neglect residual eccentricity during the inspiral and any effects it might have on pn spin alignment .",
    "we carried out a systematic study of the probability that gravitational recoils eject sbhs from their host galaxies . we generated a population of binaries with astrophysically motivated mass ratios using the monte carlo prescription described in section  [ ss : massrat ] . to quantify the effect of sbh spin magnitudes , we computed ejection probabilities for three fixed values of @xmath48 : @xmath49=0.5 , 0.75 , and 1 . to account for all possibilities",
    "given the great uncertainty in the spin - alignment distributions , we considered the four cases described in section  [ sss : dir ] : two `` symmetric '' cases ( 10/10 , 30/30 ) and two `` asymmetric '' cases ( 10/30 and 30/10 ) .    our results for @xmath201 are summarized in figure  [ fig : eject1000log ] .",
    "this figure has four panels : our simulated binaries are binned by mass ratio @xmath94 in the top panels , and by the stellar mass @xmath113 of the larger host galaxy in the bottom panels . in the right panels we assume that",
    "a gravitational recoil greater than @xmath63  km / s is needed to eject a recoiling sbh from its host galaxy , while in the left panels we adopt a prescription that depends on the stellar mass @xmath113 .",
    "the gravitational potential of a real galaxy is the sum of contributions from its stellar mass and dm halo ; although the dm halo is more massive , the more concentrated stellar contribution is dominant for large elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "modeling elliptical galaxies with the density profiles of terzi and graham @xcite , gualandris and merritt @xcite find that escape velocities have typical values @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the effective radius that contains half the galaxy s total luminosity .",
    "combining this with the observed relation @xmath204 yields the approximate expression @xcite @xmath205 this is the prescription we used to calculate escape velocities in the left panels of figure  [ fig : eject1000log ] .",
    "each panel of figure  [ fig : eject1000log ] has 7 histograms : the solid black curve corresponds to the total distribution of simulated binaries , while the 6 dashed and/or dotted colored curves correspond to the distributions of ejected sbhs given the 6 different spin - alignment distributions indicated in the keys to the figure .",

    "comparing the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : eject1000log ] allows us to understand the effects of the mass - dependent escape velocity of eq .",
    "( [ vescmerritt ] ) on the ejection probability .",
    "the most obvious effect is the steep decrease in the ejected fraction from near unity at @xmath206 to less than 10% for @xmath207 .",
    "this is very natural : heavier galaxies should be more effective at retaining recoiling sbhs .",
    "somewhat more surprising is that despite the constant escape velocity , the escape fraction also increases as @xmath208 in the bottom right panel .",
    "this is a consequence of our decision to neglect sbhs with @xmath209 that reside in galaxies with @xmath210 .",
    "because of this choice , sbhs in galaxies with @xmath211 only undergo comparable - mass ( @xmath212 ) mergers , elevating the fraction of large recoils since kicks are proportional to @xmath75 at leading order ( see eq .",
    "( 11 ) of @xcite ) .    a second effect of the mass - dependent escape velocity of eq .",
    "( [ vescmerritt ] ) is the possibility of ejecting recoiling sbhs for mass ratios as low as @xmath213 , as can be seen in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : eject1000log ] .",
    "the larger host galaxy can have a mass as small as @xmath214 for these mass ratios , corresponding to an escape velocity @xmath215  km / s by eq .",
    "( [ vescmerritt ] ) .",
    "this accounts for the nonzero escape probabilities for @xmath216 .",
    "we also note that in preparing these figures we have not evolved any pn inspirals for @xmath217 , even for those histograms labeled with @xmath218 that correspond to evolved distributions .",
    "this explains why the thin and thick lines corresponding to the initial and final histograms coincide for @xmath217 .",
    "the gravitational - wave inspiral time is inversely proportional to the binary s symmetric mass ratio @xmath219 @xcite , making it hard to preserve accuracy over long pn time evolutions for @xmath216 .",
    "however , schnittman @xcite showed that spin - orbit resonances only become important inside a `` resonance locking '' radius @xmath220 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we are therefore justified in treating all binaries with @xmath221 ( for which pn evolutions from @xmath58 to @xmath59 become problematic ) as if the inspiral did not happen : that is , we can compute recoils of binaries with @xmath222 by simply applying the recoil formula at @xmath223 .",
    "we examine how the fraction @xmath224 of ejected sbhs depends on the sbh spin magnitude @xmath49 in figure  [ fig : ejectratio ] .",
    "the two top panels in this figure were produced using the same distributions shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig : eject1000log ] ; the fraction @xmath224 is calculated by dividing the histograms for each spin distribution by the solid black histogram showing the total distribution .",
    "as expected , the ejected fractions are smaller for lower values of @xmath49 , since the kick magnitudes are reduced while the escape velocities remain fixed .",
    "ejections from host galaxies with @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) are nearly eliminated for @xmath227 ( 0.5 ) .",
    "pn spin alignment remains effective for these lower spin magnitudes ; for certain values of @xmath113 , the ejected fraction is reduced by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "careful scrutiny of the left panels of figure  [ fig : ejectratio ] reveals that pn kick enhancement for the 30/10 case drives @xmath224 above that of the 30/30 case , except at the highest values of @xmath113 for the @xmath154 and 0.75 distributions .",
    "mergers involving the most massive host galaxies are dominated by small values of @xmath94 , for which pn spin alignment is ineffective .",
    "it is also interesting to note that pn spin alignment is suppressed as @xmath228 ( the thin and thick lines converge in this limit in the right panels of figure  [ fig : ejectratio ] ) .",
    "schnittman @xcite showed that pn spin alignment increased as @xmath94 increased from 1/9 up to 9/11 ( see figure  10 of @xcite ) .",
    "symmetry implies that pn spin alignment must vanish for equal - mass binaries , since the labeling of the sbhs is arbitrary for @xmath229 and it is therefore impossible to distinguish @xmath35 from @xmath37 .",
    "this limiting behavior implies that the effects of spin alignment must be maximized for some mass ratio in the range @xmath230 , which is precisely what we observe in the right panels of figure  [ fig : ejectratio ] .",
    "these near - unity mass ratios are also expected to yield the largest kicks , which emphasizes the importance of including the effects of pn spin alignment in future studies of gravitational recoils .",
    "a final summary of our results is provided in table  [ t : fej ] , where we calculate the percentage of ejected binaries for each spin distribution .",
    "although the precise amount of spin alignment depends on the value of @xmath49 , we see that kicks are suppressed ( enhanced ) by @xmath1 ( 20% ) when the escape velocities are given by eq .",
    "( [ vescmerritt ] ) .",
    "the kick suppression or enhancement is even more dramatic for the case of a constant escape velocity @xmath231  km / s .",
    "the ejected fraction is lower overall for this choice of escape velocity , which is larger than the mean value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ vescmerritt ] ) . the kick suppression or enhancement is greater because the effects of pn spin alignment are most pronounced at the high  velocity tail of the kick distribution , as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : deltaphi ] .",

    "the primary conclusion of this paper is that kick suppression due to pn spin alignment remains highly effective despite the new dependence of the gravitational recoil on sbh spins .",
