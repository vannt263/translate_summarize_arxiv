    "such problems are usually ill - posed in the sense that their solutions do not depend continuously on the data . in practical applications ,",
    "one never has exact data , instead only noisy data are available due to errors in the measurements . even if the deviation is very small , algorithms developed for well - posed problems may fail , since noise could be amplified by an arbitrarily large factor . therefore , the development of stable methods for solving inverse problems is a central topic .    in this paper",
    "we consider the stable resolution of nonlinear inverse problems which mathematically can be formulated as the nonlinear equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a nonlinear frchet differentiable operator between two hilbert spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 whose norms and inner products are denoted as @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
