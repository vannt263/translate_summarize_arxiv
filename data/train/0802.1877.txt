    "a big achievement in the 70s-80 s was to show that , inside the axiomatic formulation of quantum mechanics , based on _ positive operator valued measures _ and _ instruments_,@xcite a consistent formulation of the theory of measurements continuous in time ( _ quantum continual measurements _ ) was possible.@xcite the main applications of quantum continual measurements are in the photon detection theory in quantum optics ( _ direct , heterodyne , homodyne detection_).@xcite a very flexible and powerful formulation of continual measurement theory was based on stochastic differential equations , of classical type ( commuting noises , it calculus ) and of quantum type ( non commuting noises , hudson - parthasarathy equation).@xcite    in this paper we start by giving a short presentation of continual measurement theory based on quantum sde s .",
    "we consider only the type of observables relevant for the description of homodyne detection and we make the mathematical simplification of introducing only bounded operators on the hilbert space of the quantum system and a finite number of noises .",
    "then , we introduce the spectrum of the classical stochastic process which represents the output and we study the general properties of the spectra of such classical processes by proving characteristic bounds due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle . finally , we present the case of a two - level atom , where the spectral analysis of the output can reveal the phenomenon of squeezing of the fluorescence light , a phenomenon related to the heisenberg uncertainty relations .",

    "the operators have to be interpreted as linear combinations of the formal increments @xmath49 , @xmath50 which represent field operators evolving with the free - field dynamics ; therefore , they have to be intended as operators in the interaction picture .",
    "the important point is that these operators commute for different times also in the heisenberg picture , because @xmath51 this is due to the factorization properties of the fock space and to the properties of the solution of the hudson - parthasarathy equation .",
    "these `` output '' quadratures are our observables .",
