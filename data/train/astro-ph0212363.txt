    "( the dependence on other parameters - hubble constant and spectral index  is also weak , as is discussed below ) .",
    "this fact makes the high redshift cluster abundance method a powerful tool in constraining @xmath0 . the results in figure [ fig : hizont ] show that for any observationally acceptable range of @xmath9 , from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , the amplitude remains in the range of @xmath73",

    "further by 10% will reduce the amplitude @xmath0 by @xmath5610% @xcite .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig : hizont ] are the analogous confidence contours from the cluster mass - function normalization at @xmath96 @xcite ; the best - fit relation is approximated by @xmath97 which has a steeper @xmath9 dependence than the high - redshift constraint .",
    "these two independent constraints overlap only at low @xmath9 . requiring that both of the constraints of equations [ [ eqn : bestfit ] ] and [ [ eqn : sdssfit ] ] be simultaneously satisfied yields    [ eqn : bestpar ] @xmath98    for the allowed 1-sigma overlap region when @xmath86=0.72 and @xmath87=1 . allowing for variations in @xmath86 and @xmath87 as discussed above yields the same central values for @xmath0 and @xmath9 , but broadens the allowed range .",
    "even with the very broad ranges adopted for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the conservative limits @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be set at the 95% confidence level .",
    "we use the observed abundance of high - mass clusters of galaxies at @xmath1 to determine the linear amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath0 .",
    "the cluster abundance depends exponentially on this amplitude , and only weakly on other parameters ; it therefore provides a powerful method for measuring this important parameter .",
    "we show that the relatively high abundance of massive clusters observed at @xmath77 , as well as their relatively slow evolution with time , requires a high amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath101 .",
    "this conclusion is nearly independent of the exact value of @xmath9 ( in the typical range of @xmath102 ) .",
    "we use the observed abundance at @xmath103 to determine a normalization relation from high redshift clusters .",
    "the relation depends only weakly on @xmath9 : @xmath104 ; alternatively , a linear relation of the form @xmath105 ( @xmath9510% ) provides a similarly good fit to the data . these fits",
    "illustrate that @xmath106 for any @xmath107 .",
    "for the typical observationally suggested value of @xmath108 , the amplitude is @xmath109 .",
    "we emphasize that this high @xmath0 value indicated by the cluster abundance at high redshift is nearly independent of the exact value of @xmath9 .",
    "we combine the high redshift constraint above with the independent normalization relation obtained from low redshift cluster abundance a relation that is steeper in @xmath9 ( @xmath110 ; equation [ [ eqn : sdssfit ] ] ) .",
    "the combination breaks the degeneracy between the two parameters .",
    "we find @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( figure [ fig : hizont ] ; equation [ [ eqn : bestpar ] ] ) .    the high value of @xmath0 required to explain the high abundance of the most massive clusters at @xmath77 is consistent with the present day cluster mass function if the mass density parameter is low , @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath9=0.3 , then the high redshift clusters still require a high amplitude ( @xmath111 ) , since this constraint is nearly independent of @xmath9 ; the low redshift cluster abundance is consistent with this value at the 2-sigma level .",
    "these results improve upon @xcite by using improvements over the standard press - schechter formula ( which does not accurately reproduce results from cosmological simulations at high redshift ) , allowing for changes in @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and by using a more recent cluster normalization relation at low redshift .",

    "this is in excellent agreement with our current conclusions .",
