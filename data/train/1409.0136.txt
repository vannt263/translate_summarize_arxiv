    "in particular smirnov @xcite ( see also camia and newman s paper @xcite ) has shown that the scaling limit of critical site - percolation on the triangular lattice @xmath4 is sle@xmath5 . to give a rough description of one version of this statement ,",

    "label the sides clockwise starting from the southwest corner as @xmath8 .",
    "a percolation configuration on @xmath6 is an element @xmath9 of @xmath10 defined as follows .",
    "fix the vertices in @xmath11 and @xmath12 to have value 0 ( or black or closed ) and those in @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be 1 ( or red or open ) . in the interior @xmath15 , set each vertex to be ( independently ) 0 or 1 , with probability @xmath16 each  see figure [ fig : small_perc ] .     with @xmath17 , with the exploration path shown in green . ]",

    ".  critical site percolation ) in the interior @xmath15 . in the case of the ising model ( where the states at two sites are not independent ) at the critical temperature ,",
    "smirnov @xcite has identified that the limiting probability measure is instead chordal _",
    "sle@xmath29_. we are interested in the limiting behavior of @xmath20 when the law of the configuration @xmath28 is the stationary distribution of the voter model ( or related models ) on @xmath15 .      in this section",
    "we define our primary model of interest , on @xmath6 as described above , with boundary states set as 0 on one pair of adjacent sides and 1 on the other pair , while the law of the interior states @xmath30 is the stationary measure for the voter model @xmath31 on @xmath15 , as follows .",
    "each @xmath32 has its own independent poisson clock ( a poisson process @xmath33 ) of rate 1 . when the clock of a vertex @xmath34 rings we update the state @xmath35 of @xmath34 by choosing one of its six neighbors uniformly at random and adopting the state of the chosen neighbor .",
    "note that the neighbor may be one of the vertices in the boundary @xmath36 whose state is fixed .",
    "defined this way , @xmath37 is an irreducible markov process with finite state space @xmath38 , and therefore it has a unique invariant distribution .",
    "we will write @xmath39 for a random configuration sampled from this invariant distribution .",
    "the process admits a well - known graphical representation ( due to t.e .",
    "harris @xcite ) which we now review .",
    "for each @xmath40 , we draw a positive half line ( representing time ) in the third dimension , and on it we mark the times of poisson clock rings of that vertex .",
    "each mark on a time line represents a state update event which also has an arrow from @xmath34 to the uniformly chosen neighbor whose state is adopted .",
    "the lines of the boundary vertices have arrow marks to them , but not from them , as those states are fixed .",
    "fix an initial configuration @xmath41 . to determine the state of a vertex @xmath42 at time @xmath43 we start at height / time @xmath43 on the time line corresponding to @xmath34 and",
    "follow it down until we reach height / time 0 or we encounter an outgoing arrow ( whichever comes first ) at height @xmath44 .",
    "if we meet an outgoing arrow we follow it to the time line of a neighboring vertex @xmath45 and proceed as before , following this time line down from height @xmath46 until reaching height / time 0 or an outgoing arrow .",
    "we stop this procedure when we reach a boundary vertex or height 0 on some time line .",
    "thus from any @xmath42 and @xmath47 the path followed corresponds to a continuous time nearest neighbor simple random walk on @xmath48 stopped upon reaching a boundary vertex or height 0 . in either case",
    "the state @xmath49 at the terminal vertex is known and we set @xmath50 .",
    "such a system of `` state genealogy walks '' from all the vertices at time @xmath43 following backward in time is a dual model and is distributed as a system of _ coalescing _ simple symmetric continuous time random walks on the triangular lattice  see for example @xcite . since @xmath48 is finite ,",
    "if @xmath43 is large enough all the walks starting then will with high probability hit the boundary before reaching height 0 . indeed ,",
    "if we continue the time lines and poisson clocks below height 0 ( and do not terminate the walks at height 0 ) then almost surely from any height @xmath43 there will be a random height @xmath51 at which the walks started from all vertices @xmath42 at height @xmath43 will have reached boundary vertices .",
    "what happens on the time lines below height @xmath52 does not affect @xmath53 since the states of the boundary vertices are fixed for all time .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the voter model itself reaches stationarity by a random finite time ( distributed as @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore to sample from @xmath39 it is enough to follow a system of coalescing continuous time simple random walks from each vertex @xmath34 of @xmath55 until they hit a boundary vertex @xmath56 , and set @xmath57 , i.e.  @xmath58 if @xmath59 , and @xmath60 otherwise . one could instead sample from @xmath39 by setting @xmath61 for every @xmath62 ( so the state space would become @xmath63 ) and simulating the voter model dynamics until there is no vertex with state 2 .",
    "figure [ fig:1sample ] shows a simulation of @xmath39 with @xmath64 , obtained by simulating coalescing random walks from each vertex in the interior , until each one has reached the boundary .     with @xmath64 , simulated using c++",
    "the white curve is the exploration path or chordal interface . ]",
    "the duality discussed in the previous section tells us that @xmath65 ( we drop the superscript @xmath0 when there is no ambiguity ) is the probability that a simple random walk started at @xmath2 first hits the boundary at a 1-site . in other words ,",
    "the one - dimensional distributions of our voter model on @xmath48 are equal to those of a model we would like to call _ harmonic percolation_. this is a model under which the states @xmath66 are independent of each other , and as we have already suggested , @xmath67 is equal to the probability that a simple random walk started from @xmath34 first hits the boundary @xmath68 at a 1-site ( i.e. , in @xmath69 ) .",
    "harmonic percolation on an infinite strip of thickness @xmath0 coincides with an independent percolation model called gradient percolation @xcite . in the case of gradient percolation the probability @xmath70 of a site @xmath2 being open changes linearly from one boundary where it is 0 to the other boundary where it is 1 .",
    "thus the function @xmath70 is harmonic inside the strip ( with specified boundary conditions ) .",
    "the difference between the voter and harmonic percolation models arises from the fact that the walks in the former are coalescing , whereas in the latter they are independent . to be more explicit ,",
    "coalescence in the voter model leads to non - zero correlations as in the following simple lemma .",
    "[ lem : correlation ] for any @xmath71 , and any @xmath72 in the interior of @xmath48 , @xmath73    fix @xmath0 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and let @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the elements of @xmath68 with fixed states 0 and 1 respectively .",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath79 be two independent random walks starting from @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "let @xmath80 be the first time that @xmath78 and @xmath79 meet each other .",
    "let @xmath81 for all times and define @xmath82 so that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are coalescing walks started from @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "let @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the respective hitting times of the boundary , and note that @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath88 this proves the result for @xmath89 .",
    "a similar coupling argument can be made for any number @xmath90 of walkers starting from vertices @xmath91 ( choosing the lower indexed random walker to continue when any two meet ) , establishing the claim .    for any @xmath92 , if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are distance at least @xmath95 from each other and the boundary @xmath96 then there exist @xmath97 and @xmath98 such that @xmath99 for @xmath100 and all @xmath0 , while @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are times when the difference random walk @xmath104 started at @xmath105 first hits the origin and the boundary of the box @xmath106 respectively , and the last equality follows from proposition 6.4.3 of @xcite .",
    "then implies that the correlation @xmath107 between the votes at @xmath74 and @xmath75 goes to zero as per the following .",
    "[ lem : corgoeszero ] let @xmath92 , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 be distance at least @xmath95 from each other and the boundary @xmath96 .",

    "two walkers wearing hats coalesce when they meet , and instantly become a single walker wearing a hat .",
    "walkers not wearing hats do not coalesce with any other walkers .",
    "in addition a poisson clock is assigned to each walker .",
    "when such a clock rings , the walker takes a random walk step , but before doing so removes her coalescence hat with probability @xmath109 .",
    "if a walker wearing a hat steps into a site with another walker with a hat on , the walker that just made its step becomes part of the coalescence set of the walker that was already at the site . upon hitting a boundary site , with probability",
    "@xmath110 a walker ( and its entire coalescence set ) is assigned the vote of the boundary vertex it hit , and otherwise ( i.e. , with probability @xmath111 ) its entire coalescence set attains an independently and uniformly chosen vote .",

    "unique and has expected length approximately @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the horizontal length of the piece of strip in which we measure boundary length ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 11 ) .",
    "so , for any @xmath92 , for all sufficiently large @xmath0 , if we take a piece of strip which is @xmath0 long ( and @xmath0 thick ) , the expected length of the interface curve @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 . for any @xmath125 , with probability going to 1 with @xmath0 ,",
    "the curve stays in the central band ( around the central @xmath126 line where @xmath127 ) of width @xmath128 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6 ) .",
    "thus , as @xmath1 , unless we appropriately zoom in around the central line , we expect to see the rescaled interface curve converge to a straight line in the center .",
    "since the harmonic function inside a rhombic area with our boundary condition looks almost linear along the diagonal that connects the middle corner of the 1 valued boundary to the middle corner of the 0 valued boundary ( or indeed along any parallel line ) , we expect that the interface curve for harmonic percolation inside our rhombus should scale to a straight line as well .",
