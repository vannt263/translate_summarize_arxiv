    "are predicted to have a sharp steepening of energy spectrum , so called gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "there are two other signatures of extragalactic protons in the spectrum : dip and bump @xcite .",
    "the dip is produced due to @xmath4 interaction at energy centered by @xmath5  ev .",
    "the bump is produced by pile - up protons which loose energy in the gzk cutoff . as was demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite , the bump is clearly seen from a single source at large redshift @xmath6 , but it practically disappears in the diffuse spectrum , because individual peaks are located at different energies .    as will be discussed in this paper ,",
    "the dip is a reliable feature in the uhe proton spectrum ( see also @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "being relatively faint feature , it is however clearly seen in the spectra observed by agasa , fly s eye , hires and yakutsk arrays ( see @xcite and @xcite for the data ) .",
    "we argue here that it can be considered as the confirmed signature of interaction of extragalactic uhe protons with cmb .     at @xmath7  ev ( triangles ) are in a good agreement with qgsjet - corsika prediction for protons.,width=302 ]    the measurement of the atmospheric height of eas maximum , @xmath8 , in the hires experiment ( see fig.[mass - comp ] ) gives another evidence of the proton composition of uhecr at @xmath9  ev .",
    "yakutsk @xcite and hires - mia @xcite data also favour the proton composition at @xmath7  ev , though some other methods of mass measurements indicate the mixed chemical composition @xcite .    at what energy the extragalactic component sets in ?    according to the kascade data @xcite , the spectrum of galactic protons has a steepening at @xmath10  ev ( the first knee ) , helium nuclei - at @xmath11  ev , and carbon nuclei - at @xmath12  ev .",
    "it confirms the rigidity - dependent confinement with critical rigidity @xmath13  ev .",
    "then cr galactic iron nuclei are expected to have the critical energy of confinement at @xmath14  ev , and extragalactic protons can naturally dominate at @xmath9  ev .",

    "it favours the transition at @xmath19  ev .",
    "the model of galactic cosmic rays developed by biermann et al @xcite also predicts the second knee as the  end  of galactic cosmic rays due to rigidity bending in wind - shell around sn , produced by wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the extragalactic component becomes the dominant one at energy @xmath19  ev ( see fig.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "below we shall analyze the features in uhe proton spectrum using basically two assumptions : the uniform distribution of the sources in the universe and the power - law generation spectrum .",
    "we shall discuss how large - scale inhomogeneities in source distribution affect the shape of the features .",
    "we do not consider the possible speculations , such as cosmological evolution of sources .",
    "in contrast to our earlier works @xcite , we do not use here the model - dependent complex generation spectrum : the modification factor method allows us to use more general power - law spectrum with an arbitrary @xmath20 .",
    "the analysis of the bump and dip is convenient to perform in terms of _ modification factor _ @xcite .",
    "the modification factor is defined as a ratio of the spectrum @xmath21 , with all energy losses taken into account , to unmodified spectrum @xmath22 , where only adiabatic energy losses ( red shift ) are included , @xmath23 for the power - law generation spectrum @xmath24 from the sources without cosmological evolution one obtains the unmodified spectrum as @xmath25 where the observed energy @xmath26 and emissivity @xmath27 are measured in gev and gev / mpc@xmath28yr , respectively . the connection between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is given by usual cosmological expression ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the flux @xmath21 is calculated as in @xcite with all energy losses included .    in fig .",
    "[ mfactor ] the modification factor is shown as a function of energy for two spectrum indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "they do not differ much from each other because both numerator and denominator in eq .",
    "( [ modif ] ) include factor @xmath33 .",
    "let us discuss first the bump .",
    "we see no indication of the bump in fig .",
    "[ mfactor ] at merging of @xmath34 and @xmath35 curves , where it should be located .",
    "the absence of the bump in the _ diffuse spectrum _ can be easily understood .",
    "the bumps are clearly seen in the spectra of the single remote sources @xcite .",
    "these bumps , located at different energies , produce a flat feature , when they are summed up in the diffuse spectrum .",
    "this effect can be illustrated by fig .  5 from ref .",
    "the diffuse flux there is calculated in the model where sources are distributed uniformly in the sphere of radius @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) . when @xmath37 are small ( between 0.01 and 0.1 ) the bumps are seen in the diffuse spectra . when radius of the sphere becomes larger , the bumps merge producing the flat feature in the spectrum .",
    "if the diffuse spectrum is plotted as @xmath38 this flat feature looks like a pseudo - bump .",
    "the _ dip _ is more reliable signature of interaction of protons with cmb than gzk feature .",
    "the shape of the gzk feature is strongly model - dependent : it is more flat in case of local overdensity of the sources , and more steep in case of their local deficit .",
    "it depends also on fluctuations in the distances between sources inside the gzk sphere and on fluctuations of luminosities of the sources there .",
    "the shape of the _ dip _ is fixed and has a specific form which is difficult to imitate by other mechanisms .",
    "the protons in the dip are collected from the large volume with the radius about 1000  mpc and therefore the assumption of uniform distribution of sources within this volume is well justified .",
    "in contrast to this well predicted and specifically shaped feature , the cutoff , if discovered , can be produced as the acceleration cutoff . since the shape of both gzk cutoff and acceleration cutoff is model - dependent , it will be difficult to argue in favour of any of them .",
    "the problem of identification of the dip depends on the accuracy of observational data , which should confirm the specific ( and well predicted ) shape of this feature .",
    "do the present data have the needed accuracy ?    the comparison of the calculated modification factor with that obtained from the akeno - agasa data , using @xmath32 , is given in fig .",
    "[ mfactora ] .",
    "it shows the excellent agreement between predicted and observed modification factors for the dip .    in fig .",
    "[ mfactora ] one observes that at @xmath39  ev the agreement between calculated and observed modification factors becomes worse and at @xmath40  ev the observational modification factor becomes larger than 1 . since by definition @xmath41 , it signals about appearance of another component of cosmic rays , which is most probably galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the condition @xmath42 means the dominance of the new ( galactic ) component , the transition occurs at higher energy .    to calculate @xmath43 for the confirmation of the dip by akeno - agasa data , we choose the energy interval between @xmath44  ev ( which is somewhat arbitrary in our analysis ) and @xmath3  ev ( the energy of intersection of @xmath34 and @xmath45 ) . in calculations",
    "we used the gaussian statistics for low - energy bins , and the poisson statistics for the high energy bins of agasa .",
    "it results in @xmath0 .",
    "the number of akeno - agasa bins is 19 .",
    "we use in calculations two free parameters : @xmath20 and the total normalization of spectrum . in effect",
    ", the confirmation of the dip is characterised by @xmath0 for d.o.f.=17 , or @xmath43/d.o.f.=1.12 , very close to the ideal value 1.0 for the poisson statistics .    in fig .",
    "[ mfactorh ] the comparison of modification factor with the hires data is shown .",
    "the agreement is also very good : @xmath46 for @xmath47 for the poisson statistics .",
    "the good agreement of the shape of the dip @xmath34 with observations is a strong evidence for extragalactic protons interacting with cmb .",
    "this evidence is confirmed by the hires data on the mass composition ( see fig .  [ mass - comp ] ) .",
    "the dip is also present in case of diffusive propagation in magnetic field @xcite .",
    "does modification factor for iron nuclei differ from the proton dip ?",
    "we calculated the modification factor for iron nuclei , assuming that that fe nuclei are the heaviest ones accelerated in the sources , and considering the propagation of fe nuclei with energy losses taken into account .",
    "the resulting flux is given only for primary iron nuclei , without secondary nuclei produced during propagation ( more details will be presented in @xcite ) .",
    "the energy losses for fe are dominated by adiabatic energy losses up to @xmath48  ev , from where on @xmath49 energy losses dominate . for energies",
    "@xmath50  ev photodissociation becomes the main source of energy losses @xcite .",
    "according to this dependence the energy spectrum of iron nuclei is @xmath51 up to @xmath52  ev , where the first steepening begins .",
    "the second steepening , caused by iron - nuclei destruction , occurs at energy @xmath53  ev . for lighter nuclei",
    "the steepening ( cutoff ) starts at lower energies .",
    "therefore the cutoff of the nuclei spectra occurs approximately at the same energy as the gzk cutoff , though the physical reason for these two cutoffs is different : while the latter ( gzk ) is caused by starting of photopion production , the former ( nuclei ) - by transition from adiabatic to pair - production energy losses @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ iron ] the modification factors for iron nuclei are shown as function of energy in comparison with modification factors for protons .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ mfactora ] clearly shows that even small admixture of iron nuclei in the primary extragalactic flux upsets the good agreement of the proton dip with observational data .",
    "there are three signatures of uhe protons propagating through cmb : gzk cutoff , bump and dip .",
    "the energy shape of the gzk feature is model dependent .",
    "the local excess of sources makes it flatter , and the deficit - steeper .",
    "the shape is affected by fluctuations of source luminosities and distances between the sources .",
    "the cutoff , if discovered , can be produced as the acceleration cutoff ( steepening below the maximum energy of acceleration ) .",
    "since the shape of both , the gzk cutoff and acceleration cutoff , is model - dependent , it will be difficult to argue in favour of any of them , in case a cutoff is discovered .",
    "the _ bump _ is produced by pile - up protons , which are loosing energy in photopion interactions and are accumulated at low energy , where the photopion energy losses become equal to that due to pair - production .",
    "such bump is distinctly seen in calculation of spectrum from a single remote source . in the diffuse spectrum , since the individual peaks located at different energies , a flat spectrum feature is produced .",
    "the _ dip _ is the most remarkable feature of interaction with cmb .",
    "the protons in this energy region are collected from the distances @xmath54  mpc , with each radial interval @xmath55 providing the equal flux .",
    "all density irregularities and all fluctuations are averaged at this distance , and assumption of uniform distribution of sources with average distances between sources and average luminosities becomes quite reliable .",
    "the dip is confirmed by akeno - agasa and hires data with the great accuracy ( see figs [ mfactora ] and [ mfactorh ] ) . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ iron ] , presence of even small fraction of extragalactic heavy nuclei in the primary flux upsets this agreement .",
    "+ _ we interpret the excellent agreement of the calculated dip with the observations as an independent evidence that observed primaries at energy @xmath56  ev are extragalactic protons .",
    "this evidence is the complementary one to the direct measurements ( now contradictive ) of chemical composition . _",
    "+ at energy @xmath57  ev the modification factor from akeno data exceeds 1 , and it signals about dominance of another cosmic ray component , most probably the galactic one .",
    "it agrees with transition from galactic to extragalactic component at the second knee @xmath19  ev . this conclusion is confirmed by the recent hires data on mass composition ( see fig .",
    "[ mass - comp ] ) and indirectly by the kascade data ( see @xcite for the detailed analysis ) .",
    "are there alternative explanations of the dip ? the conservative one ( see e.g. @xcite ) is known since early 80s , when the spectrum feature , _ ankle _ , was discovered in the haverah park data @xcite at @xmath58  ev .",
    "this feature was interpreted as transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ( in contrast to the calculations above where the ankle naturally appears as a part of the dip ) .",
    "the hypothesis of the transition at the ankle can be described phenomenologically as follows : at energy below @xmath59  ev the cosmic ray flux is galactic and above - extragalactic .",
    "the galactic spectrum can be taken basically as power - law @xmath60 , but agreement with observations needs steepening at @xmath61 , described by some steepening parameter . in effect",
    "one can use the parametrization : @xmath62 . \\label{gal}\\ ] ] the extragalactic generation spectrum is assumed to be power - law with index @xmath20 . together with two constants of the normalization for both fluxes , one has as minimum six free parameters to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "we found the best fit shown in fig .",
    "[ adhoc ] .",
    "it is characterized by @xmath63 for 19 energy bins and 6 free parameters , i.e. by @xmath64 for d.o.f.=13 .",
    "the value @xmath65 for the poisson statistics signals for the large number of the free parameters and for very good formal fit to the experimental data .",
    "the problem of this ad hoc model is whether there is a physical model for propagation of galactic cosmic rays , which results in spectrum given by eq.([gal ] ) .",
    "it is just _ assumed _ that the spectrum at @xmath66  ev is the same as observed , while the dip model _ predicts _ this spectrum in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "an intermediate case is given in @xcite where the dip is mostly described by extragalactic protons interacting with cmb with a small correction given by galactic cosmic rays only at the low - energy , @xmath67  ev , part of the dip ( see fig . 13 in @xcite ) .",
    "+    how does extragalactic magnetic field affect the discussed spectra features ?",
    "the influence of magnetic field on spectrum depends on the separation of the sources @xmath68 .",
    "there is a statement which has a status of the theorem @xcite : + for uniform distribution of sources with separation much less than characteristic lengths of propagation , such as energy attenuation length @xmath69 and the diffusion length @xmath70 , the diffuse spectrum of uhecr has an universal ( standard ) form independent of mode of propagation .    for the realistic intergalactic magnetic fields the spectrum is universal in energy interval @xmath71  ev @xcite .",
    "note , however , that generation spectrum is defined in @xcite as one outside the source . in this work",
    "we implicitly assume that the sources are transparent for uhe protons and thus the generation spectrum is the same as the acceleration spectrum .",
    "the most probable astrophysical sources of uhecr are agn .",
    "they can accelerate particles to @xmath72  ev and provide the needed emissivity of uhecr @xmath73  erg / mpc@xmath28yr .",
    "the correlation of uhe particles with directions to special type of agn , bl lacs , is found in analysis of work @xcite .",
    "agn as uhecr sources in case of quasi(rectilinear ) propagation of protons explain most naturally the small - scale anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the uhecr from agn have a problem with supergzk particles with energies @xmath74  ev : ( i ) another component is needed for explanation of the agasa excess , and ( ii ) no sources are observed in agasa and other arrays in direction of supergzk particles .",
    "these problems probably imply the new physics , such as uhecr from superheavy dark matter , new signal carrier , like e.g. new light stable hadron , strongly interacting neutrino , and lorentz invariance violation . for the last case it is interesting to note that if lorentz invariance is weakly broken for @xmath49 production , but strongly for pion production , then the modification factor is given by the curve @xmath75 in fig .",
