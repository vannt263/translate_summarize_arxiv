    ", wfc3/ir has been used to obtain the deepest nir images ever seen as part of the hudf09 program ( pi : illingworth ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this pushed the observational frontier of galaxies from @xmath11 well into the reionization epoch , with first constraints even at @xmath12 @xcite .    in combination with deep ancillary optical data from the hudf @xcite and goods surveys",
    "@xcite , the wfc3/ir data from the hudf09 and the ers @xcite programs allowed for the identification of more than 130 @xmath13 galaxy candidates to date using the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) selection technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "since the ly@xmath14 absorption of the neutral inter - galactic medium shifts to @xmath15  at @xmath16 , such galaxies can only be detected in the nir data and are completely invisible in the optical .",

    "furthermore , @xmath0 proto - cluster candidates have been identified in pure parallel wfc3/ir data @xcite .    while the first deep wfc3/ir data sets provide good constraints on the faint population at @xmath20 , they only probe a limited volume and therefore result in poor constraints on the much less abundant bright galaxies around the exponential cut - off of the lf . at @xmath21 ,",
    "constraints on this bright cut - off can be obtained using ground - based , wide - area data from , e.g. , subaru or the vlt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , beyond @xmath21 , the galaxy population is too faint , and the sky is too bright to efficiently detect @xmath22 galaxies from the ground with current facilities , resulting only in upper limits at @xmath23 mag @xcite in the field .",
    "note that ground - based searches behind lensing clusters resulted in a few potential @xmath24 candidates ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in limits on the bright end of the @xmath25 lf @xcite .    due to the limited volume probed at @xmath0 with current deep",
    "_ hst _ data , the bright end of the @xmath0 lf has thus remained quite uncertain , subject to large cosmic variance .",
    "for example , in the hudf09 - 2 field data @xcite identified two very bright ( @xmath26 mag ) sources ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which possibly biased the previous measurement of the @xmath0 uv lf towards somewhat higher values .",
    "it is therefore essential to study larger area wfc3/ir data to quantify how representative these bright candidates are of the @xmath0 galaxy population .",
    "there are a few ongoing and planned _ hst _ programs that can be used for this task .",
    "first , the multi - cycle treasury program candels is obtaining @xmath17 data over the two goods fields @xcite , resulting in a total search area for @xmath0 galaxies of @xmath27 arcmin@xmath2 .",
    "second , the pure parallel programs borg @xcite and hippies @xcite , are designed to find rare bright @xmath0 galaxy candidates , sampling a combined total of about @xmath28 arcmin@xmath2 to varying depths .",
    "before the advent of jwst , the combination of different wfc3/ir data sets probing different scales will likely be the only way to obtain a well - sampled uv lf at @xmath0 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we take advantage of the full @xmath17-band data obtained over the goods - south field as part of the candels program to identify relatively bright @xmath0 galaxy candidates at absolute magnitudes @xmath29 mag .",
    "we combine these with our previous @xmath0 searches in the ultra - deep data from the hudf09 as well as the ers programs to significantly improve the sampling of the bright end of the @xmath0 uv lf . with the inclusion of the candels field ,",
    "we essentially triple the search area for bright @xmath0 galaxies in goods - south relative to our previous analysis , resulting in much more reliable constraints on the shape of the bright end of the lf and the luminosity at which an exponential cutoff might occur .",
    "an accurate measurement of the bright part of the uv lf is critical for enabling meaningful comparisons with galaxy evolution models at these redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the bright end potentially contains important information on the star - formation efficiencies , formation timescales and duty cycles of galaxies within dark matter halos in the first few hundred myr of cosmic time .",
    "furthermore , a well sampled bright end of the lf helps to break degeneracies in fitting the schechter function @xcite .",
    "even if shallower data sets do not provide real information on the faint - end slopes , they can still decrease the uncertainties on the faint - end slope , assuming that the shape of the lf can accurately be described by a schechter function ( e.g. , see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "accurate estimates of the faint - end slope are critical for obtaining realistic constraints on the number of ionizing photons emitted by the ultra - faint galaxy population at these redshifts . within the current uncertainties",
    "it is unclear whether the faint galaxy population was luminous enough to reionize the universe alone at @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the identification of brighter @xmath0 galaxy candidates is crucially important to provide candidates for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "spectroscopy has proven to be extremely challenging , mainly due to the intrinsic faintness of the sources , the abundance of bright night - sky lines , and the absorption of a significant fraction of the ly@xmath14 flux of these galaxies by the neutral inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "therefore the progress in spectroscopic follow - up has been relatively slow , with only a handful of confirmed sources at @xmath21 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath0 ,",

    "the completion of the @xmath17 imaging over the candels goods south field ( see figure [ fig : fields ] ) has made this a unique data set for studying the bright end of the @xmath0 uv lf based on a @xmath17-dropout selection .",
    "the candels data is split in two parts , candels - deep and candels - wide .",
    "the first covers the central part of goods south in @xmath40 tiles with @xmath13.5 orbits in each filter @xmath17 , @xmath35  and @xmath36 .",

    "in addition , we combined all the public wfc3/ir data that have been taken over these fields before march 2012 from other programs .",
    "in particular , we included the imaging data of the supernovae follow - up program of candels ( pi : riess ) , which adds imaging over a few pointings of candels deep .",
    "the final exposure map of all the @xmath17  data included is shown in figure [ fig : fields ] .",
    "the central part covered by the ultra - deep hudf09 program was omitted from our analysis of the candels data in order not to replicate the bright candidates of that field given in the study of @xcite .",
    "we will use those candidates , however , when computing the total @xmath0 lf in section [ sec : z8lf ] ( see also section [ sec : deepdata ] ) .",

    "pixels affected by persistence from previous observations , as identified from the persistence masks provided by stsci , have been flagged and removed from our reductions .",
    "for the last few visits of f105w data , we found that the cosmic ray subtraction of the archived data was not satisfactory .",
    "we therefore masked all pixels that were affected by cosmic rays in the archived data which resulted in much cleaner reductions .",
    "the optical acs data used here include the original goods optical imaging as well as additional data available over these fields from supernova follow - up programs .",
    "these reach about @xmath47 mag deeper in @xmath34 than the v2.0 reductions of goods .",
    "this is critical for excluding interlopers to the @xmath0 galaxy selections .",
    "we restricted our analysis to the part of the wfc3/ir data where imaging in all three filters ( as well as full acs coverage ) was available .",
    "this results in 60.2 arcmin@xmath2 and 34.2 arcmin@xmath2 for candels deep and wide , respectively .",
    "finally , we also include a full reduction of all the acs f814w filter data available over goods south .",
    "such data was mainly taken in parallel to other observations of several programs . in particular , most of the candels wfc3/ir observations obtained f814w data in parallel . however , over the years , several such programs have been conducted , and the resulting data reach to a non - uniform depth of @xmath48 mag , i.e. they are deeper than the original goods @xmath32 data , and in several parts of the field are essentially the deepest filter data now .",

    "when we compute the lf , we therefore include all the @xmath0 galaxy candidates that we previously identified in @xcite .",
    "these candidates were selected from the three ultra - deep wfc3/ir pointings of the hudf09 program ( pi : illingworth ) as well as from @xmath140 arcmin@xmath2 of wfc3/ir early release science data ( ers ; see * ? ? ?",
    "in total , these are 59 @xmath0 galaxy candidates with magnitudes in the range @xmath49 mag over the total area of @xmath50 arcmin@xmath2 . for more information on these candidates and their selection ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . as we describe below",
    ", we use essentially identical selection procedures to @xcite , to ensure that we can combine the new lf results and the older ones without corrections or biases .",
    "source catalogs are obtained with the sextractor program @xcite , which is used to detect galaxies in the square - root of chi - square image @xcite computed from the @xmath35 and @xmath36 data .",
    "we perform matched aperture photometry on point spread function ( psf)-matched images .",
    "the colors used here are based on small elliptical apertures ( 1.2 kron ; these are typically nearly round and about 0.2  long axis ) , and total magnitudes are measured in standard 2.5 kron apertures ( typically 0.4  radius ) , corrected to total fluxes using the psf encircled energy of an equivalent aperture to account for flux loss in psf wings ( typically @xmath51 mag ) .    the input rms maps were scaled to properly represent the flux variations in @xmath52 radius apertures , which were used to establish the detection significance of sources .",
    "the rms scaling was done based on the detected variation in 1000 random apertures per wfc3/ir frame on empty sky regions after @xmath53 clipping .",
    "this procedure ensures that the weight maps correctly reproduce the actual noise in the images .",
    "subsequently only sources with signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) larger than 4.5 in @xmath36 are considered ( as measured in @xmath52 radius circular apertures ) .",
    "thanks to the strong igm absorption in the rest - frame uv , @xmath0 galaxies can be selected in broad - band color - color diagrams . at @xmath16 the ly@xmath14 absorption shifts into the @xmath17 band , rendering galaxies red in @xmath18 , while the @xmath54 color of star - forming galaxies is still expected to be blue . the selection is discussed here , but the most challenging aspect is to minimize the contamination from low redshift objects , as we discuss in sections [ sec : chi2opt ] and [ sec : contamination ] .",
    "we adopt the same color selection criteria for our @xmath0 selection as in @xcite , which will allow us to directly combine the previous data with the candidates identified here .",
    "specifically , the selection criteria are : @xmath55 additionally , we require sources to be detected at 4.5@xmath56 in both @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and at 5@xmath56 in at least one of these two bands .",
    "finally , we require candidates to be detected at @xmath57 in all the optical acs data , and also require candidates to meet an optical @xmath6 flux constraint .",
    "both tests play a major role in removing potential low - redshift contaminants ( see section [ sec : chi2opt ] ) . finally , we checked the @xmath33 images of all sources and additionally required galaxies to be @xmath58 non - detections also in @xmath33 .",
    "this last test helped to eliminate three sources which are likely contaminants .",
    "the above color criterion is illustrated in figure [ fig : colcol ] , where we show the expected colors of star - forming galaxies using 100 myr old stellar population models from @xcite .",
    "these are additionally reddened with small amounts of dust using the dust law of @xcite .",
    "the igm absorption is modeled using @xcite .",
    "our color criteria start to select such galaxies @xmath59 .",
    "the selection then peaks around @xmath0 and falls off due to the combination of an increased distance modulus and flux reduction as the lyman break approaches the filter bandpass limit at higher redshift ( see fig . 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "the mean redshift of our sample is @xmath60 , with 80% of galaxies expected to lie at @xmath61 ( see fig [ fig : selfun ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : colcol ] , we also show the colors of lower redshift galaxies using @xcite templates , as well as cool dwarf stars @xcite , which could potentially contaminate our selection . despite some overlap in this color - color diagram with @xmath20 galaxy candidates",
    ", we expect the contamination of such sources to be small due to our strict optical non - detection criteria ( see next section and discussion in section [ sec : contamination ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panel of figure [ fig : colcol ] , where we show the expected @xmath6 values ( defined in the next section ) as a function of @xmath54 color for different galaxy types .",
    "most intermediate redshift galaxies are expected to be well detected in the optical data , resulting in @xmath62 .",
    "only completely quiescent galaxies would lie close to our selection box .",
    "the figure also includes the measured values of the candels @xmath0 candidates ( see section [ sec : z8candidates ] ) .",
    "the sizes of the symbols represent their @xmath18 colors .",
    "our selection includes only three galaxies with relatively blue @xmath18 colors with positive @xmath6 values between 1 and 3 .",
    "these would have the highest probability of being lower redshift contaminants .    as a further step against interlopers",
    ", we check each candidate for bright detections in the _ spitzer _ irac 3.6  images available over goods - south ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this has proven to be a very effective test for removing dusty contaminants in very high - z galaxy searches in which only limited information on the uv - continuum slope of galaxies is available ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "young , star - forming galaxies at @xmath20 with small amounts of dust reddening are expected to show colors @xmath63\\lesssim1 $ ] ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . any galaxy with substantially redder colors is therefore likely to be a lower redshift contaminant .",
    "indeed , in constructing our sample , we identified one bright ( @xmath64 mag ) edge - on spiral galaxy ( at 03:32:14.72,@xmath6527:46:21.6 ) , which satisfied our wfc3/ir color and optical non - detection criteria .",
    "however , this source is extremely luminous in the irac data , with @xmath63=2.3 $ ] , and is also clearly detected even in the [ 8.0 ] band , as expected for a heavily dust obscured source at intermediate redshift .",
    "we therefore removed it from the potential @xmath0 galaxy sample .",
    "all other sources where we could measure irac fluxes ( i.e. which were not completely blended with bright foreground sources ) were consistent with the limit @xmath63<1 $ ] .",
    "non - detection criterion in the candels deep data .",
    "the histograms show the different distribution functions for empty sky positions ( gray filled ) , as well as what is expected for contaminants based on our simulations .",
    "true @xmath0 sources will have a distribution like the gray empty sky distribution .",
    "the orange distribution is based on simulations using galaxies from the hudf09 to which we applied gaussian flux scatter appropriate to our @xmath66 mag shallower candels data .",
    "the dark red histogram corresponds to simulations using brighter galaxies in the candels field itself , which are dimmed and have the appropriate flux scatter applied .",
    "the distributions from the two simulations are very similar .",

    "we are able to reduce the contamination rate by a factor @xmath68-@xmath69 ( the ratio of the dark red area to the total ) . the residual contamination in our fields is expected to be about 1 source in the candels deep data and @xmath70 in candels wide giving a total contamination rate of about 10% .",

    "the @xmath0 candidates were selected using very strict optical non - detection requirements , including a measurement of the optical @xmath6 flux ( see section[sec : chi2opt ] ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce the expected contamination due to photometric scatter and due to the limited depth of the optical data relative to the wfc3/ir imaging by a factor @xmath124 .",
    "our sample is thus expected to show relatively low levels of contamination , which we estimate to be @xmath126 .",
    "interestingly , the observed surface density of @xmath0 galaxies is @xmath213 lower than expected from the previous best - fit @xmath0 lf of @xcite , though the difference is consistent with the statistics from the small numbers of objects at bright magnitudes in the previous search .",
    "this previous estimate was based on the much smaller area data from the hudf09 fields and the ers data . by using the current candels imaging we triple the search volume for luminous galaxies at @xmath237 mag in the cdfs relative to our previous analysis , thus reducing the potential biases introduced by cosmic variance .",
    "we combine our new candels @xmath0 candidates with our previous candidates from the much deeper hudf09 and ers fields to derive the best possible measurement of the uv lf .",
    "the best - fit @xmath0 uv lf we derive in this way is consistent with the previous estimates from @xcite .",
    "however , the best - fit characteristic magnitude is fainter by @xmath210 mag ( @xmath238 mag ) . despite the larger area probed here ,",
    "the uncertainties on the schechter function parameters are still significant .",
    "nonetheless , these new results are contributing to our growing understanding of the evolution of key parameters in the luminosity function from @xmath0 to @xmath233 , and of the star formation rate density from @xmath12 to @xmath233 .",
    "a combination of future wide area data , as well as deeper wfc3/ir imaging will be necessary to further improve on these very important measurements that are crucial for refining our estimates of the role of uv photons from galaxies in the reionization of the universe before the advent of jwst .",

    "at the same time our paper was submitted , the candels team submitted a very similar @xmath0 galaxy search in @xcite . that paper is still under review and is likely to change further ( yan 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "below we explicitly compare only to version 2 of their manuscript , which is publicly available on arxiv at the time of publication of our paper .",
    "the @xcite analysis is not based on the complete goods - south candels data set ( they include 83% of the final data in @xmath35 and @xmath36 that was used in our analysis ) .",
    "additionally , they only analyze the candels - deep area ( see fig [ fig : fields ] ) , and they only include 8-epoch mosaics of the @xmath33 image .    for comparison , our analysis is based on * all * the @xmath33 data available over the goods - south , which was obtained from a large number of additional programs ( ers , hudf09 , candels sne follow - up , 3d - hst , and the uvudf ) . as noted in the main text , these data reach almost 1 mag deeper than the goods @xmath32 data , and are thus an extremely valuable addition to check for low - redshift contaminants . additionally , we include a deeper reduction of the other acs images including additional data taken after the original goods - south program , which reaches to @xmath239 mag deeper compared to the goods v2.0 data .",
    "the revised v2 manuscript of @xcite lists a total of 16 different @xmath17-dropout candidates , which are split in two different samples , one using auto fluxes and one using iso fluxes for computing colors . out of these 16 sources ,",
    "only 5 are in common with our sample .",
    "@xcite use somewhat more restrictive color criteria than what we adopt here ( @xmath240 , instead of @xmath241 as used in our analysis ) .",
    "therefore , we would have expected to select all their sources in our catalog .    upon inspection of their sources",
    ", we found the main reason that @xcite @xmath0 candidates did not appear in our catalog is due to a large fraction of their candidates showing non - negligible flux in the optical acs data such that they do not satisfy our strict optical non - detection criterion @xmath242 .",
    "this applied to 7 out of their 16 candidates .",
    "@xcite state that they perform a two - stage source selection , which includes a visual inspection of their candidates using all the data .",
    "however , some sources show detections in our reduction of the optical acs data , disqualifying these sources being at @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , two sources are detected in the hudf acs data .",
    "since these data were used in their visual inspection , we do not have an explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "in addition to these 7 sources with optical flux , their list also includes two sources which are not significantly detected ( @xmath243 ) in our @xmath36-band image , as well as two sources for which we measure @xmath244 colors that are too blue , although they are consistent with being @xmath245-dropouts at the @xmath156 level .    a detailed summary of all our measurements and analysis of the @xcite sample is provided in table [ tab : yancomparison ] , and an example of optical stamps for two sources are shown in figure [ fig : yanydrops ] .",
    "given this disagreement , it is encouraging , however , that @xcite do , in fact , include 5 out of the 6 sources with @xmath246 from our sample which satisfy their stricter color criterion of @xmath247 ( see table [ tab : phot ] ) .",
    "this indicates that our selection is quite robust , at least for higher - significance sources , if optically detected interlopers are excluded properly , as done for our catalog .",
    "we stress again that making full use of all the information in the optical data is extremely important for a reliable lbg selection .",
    "we did our best possible effort to do this by including a limit in the optical @xmath248 measurement and by analyzing all the available optical acs data that were taken over this field .",
    "furthermore , we note that as long as the contamination fractions and detection efficiencies are modeled self - consistently , using shallower data should not result in a different estimate of the final lf ( within the errors ) .",

    "<S> the new data show that the uv lf is a factor @xmath8 lower at @xmath3 mag than determined from the hudf09 and ers data alone . </S>",
    "<S> combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the hudf09 and ers data allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the @xmath0 uv lf yet . </S>",
    "<S> schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best - fit characteristic magnitude of @xmath9 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the faint - end slope is very steep , though quite uncertain , with @xmath10 . a combination of wide area data with additional ultra - deep imaging will be required to significantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future </S>"
