    "one of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum mechanics is a quantum tunneling through a barrier .",
    "the tunneling shows up in zener tunneling in biased semiconductors , quantum devices like diodes , scanning tunneling microscopy , @xmath0 decay in heavy nuclei , etc . in general",
    ", however , the tunneling rate (: tunneling power ) is very small or the tunneling time is very long . even in the case of resonant tunneling of electrons through hetero - structures @xcite , there is room for research on the tunneling time @xcite .",
    "therefore it is desirable to invent a protocol of accelerating the tunneling .",
    "masuda and nakamura @xcite investigated a way to accelerate quantum dynamics with use of a characteristic driving potential determined by the additional phase of a wave function .",
    "one can accelerate a given quantum dynamics to obtain a target state in any desired short time .",
    "this kind of acceleration is called the fast forward @xcite of quantum dynamics , which constitutes one of the promising ways of the shortcut to adiabaticity @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the fast forward and the shortcut to adiabaticity is nowadays clear@xcite .",
    "the idea of the tunneling seems to be incompatible with that of fast forward .",
    "but here one can combine these two ideas , that is , one can conceive a theory to accelerate the tunneling dynamics through the high barrier and complete , in any desired short time , the tunneling phenomena which originally needs a long tunneling time .    before embarking upon the main part of the text",
    ", we briefly summarize the previous theory of the fast - forward of quantum dynamics by masuda and nakamura @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation in standard time with a nonlinearity constant @xmath1 ( appearing in macroscopic quantum dynamics ) is represented as @xmath2 @xmath3 is a known function of space @xmath4 and time @xmath5 under a given potential @xmath6 and is called a standard state . for any long time @xmath7 called as a standard final time , we choose @xmath8 as a target state that we are going to generate .",
    "let @xmath9 be a fast - forwarded state of @xmath10 as defined by @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath5 is a new time variable distinct from the standard one .",
    "@xmath13 is a magnification time - scale factor defined by @xmath14 we consider the fast - forward dynamics with a new time variable which reproduces the target state @xmath15 in a shorter final time @xmath16 defined by @xmath17    since the generation of @xmath18 requires an anomalous mass reduction , @xmath18 as it stands can not be a candidate for the fast - forward state@xcite .",
    "but one can obtain the target state by considering a fast - forwarded state @xmath19 which differs from @xmath20 by an extra phase as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a real function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and is called the additional phase . with use of a new time variable @xmath5 that appeared in eq.([ff - t ] ) , the schrdinger equation for fast - forward state @xmath23 is supposed to be given as @xmath24 with the driving scalar potential @xmath25 . if we shall choose @xmath26 as in eq.([alpha ] ) , the additional phase can vanish at the final time of the fast - forward @xmath27 and we can obtain the exact target state @xmath28    the explicit expression for @xmath26 in the fast - forward range ( @xmath29 ) is proposed by masuda and nakamura@xcite as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean value of @xmath26 and is given by @xmath32 .",
    "besides the time - dependent scaling factor in eq.([nonunif - scale ] ) in the fast - forward range , we can also have recourse to the uniform scaling factor : @xmath33 which will be useful in the quantitative analysis of fast forward . substituting eqs.([mn - standeq]),([ff - t ] ) and ( [ add - f ] ) into eq.([mn - ffeq ] ) and taking its real and imagery parts , we obtain a pair of equations for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are solvable .    while the above idea guarantees the exact target state at @xmath36 , in the intermediate time range @xmath37 it accelerates only the amplitude of the wave function and fails to accelerate its phase because of the non - vanishing additional phase @xmath34 in eq.([add - f ] ) on the way .",
    "if one wish to accelerate the time - dependent current , one must innovate the theory to recover the phase exactly in the intermediate time range until @xmath36 , which will be done below .",
    "our theory will hold to both quantum dynamics described by the schrdinger equation and macroscopic quantum dynamics described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "section [ new appro ] is concerned with a new framework of the exact fast forward of both quantum and macroscopic quantum dynamics .",
    "sections [ ff - tunnel - wp ] and [ moshinsky ] are devoted to application to quantum tunneling ( @xmath38 ) and section [ macro ] treats the macroscopic quantum tunneling which includes the nonlinearity ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the wave function @xmath3 of a charged particle in the presence of the scalar potential @xmath40 is the same as in eq.([mn - standeq ] ) . for any long time",
    "@xmath7 called as a standard final time , we choose @xmath41 as a target state that we are going to generate .",
    "in contrast to the previous works @xcite , the fast - forward wave function here does not include the additional phase factor throughout the fast forwarding time range until @xmath42 in eq.([t - tff ] ) and is given by @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the same as in eq.([ff - t ] ) .",
    "we shall try to realize @xmath23 by applying the electro - magnetic field @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "finally in this section , we shall evaluate the expectation of energy of a particle in fast - forward dynamics and compare it with the corresponding expectation in standard dynamics .",

    "we developed a theory of fast - forwarding of quantum dynamics for charged particles , which exactly accelerates both amplitude and phase of the wave function throughout the fas - forward time range .",
    "we elucidated the nature of the driving electro - magnetic field together with vector and scalar potentials to guarantee these exact fast forwarding .",
    "the theory is applied to the tunneling phenomena through a tunneling barrier .",
    "typical examples described here are : 1 ) the initially - exponential wave packet moving through the delta - function barrier ; 2 ) the opened moshinsky shutter with a delta - function barrier just behind the shutter .",
    "standard ( non - accelerated ) dynamics in these examples is known to be exactly solvable .",
    "we see the remarkable squeezing and enhancement of the tunneling current density , caused by the fast - forwarding of quantum tunneling .",
    "we find : even if the barrier height will be increased , one can generate a recognizable tunneling current by using a large enough time - scaling factor @xmath26 . at the same time , we have shown : so long as @xmath26 is less than @xmath158 with the barrier height @xmath162 and incident energy @xmath257 in the standard tunneling , the corresponding fast - forwarded dynamics is also the tunneling phenomenon keeping the particle s energy @xmath155 below the barrier height @xmath162 throughout the time evolution , and the time scaling works more effectively for the particle with lower incident energy .",
    "the analysis is also carried out on the acceleration of macroscopic quantum tunneling with use of the nonlinear schrdinger equation which accommodates a delta - function barrier .",
    "finally we should note that this work is inside a broader concept to enhance the visibility of quantum transient phenomena ( post - exponential decay@xcite , quantum backflow@xcite , diffraction in time@xcite , as well as quantum tunneling ) which are predictable by quantum mechanics but hardly detectable because the detection number of particles is very small .",
