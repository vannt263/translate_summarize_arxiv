    "theoretical efforts to interpret the observational data and to understand the nature of the dark sector do necessarily involve a vivid interplay between general relativity , astrophysics and particle physics . since the simplest solution to account for the late time accelerated expansion of the universe , the one given in terms of a tiny positive cosmological constant ,",
    "is plagued with conceptual problems , one has been compelled to examine different solutions @xcite .    motivated by the high energy physics , an interesting alternative for obtaining the necessary negative pressure to account for the accelerated expansion involves the dynamics of a scalar field , @xmath2 , evolving slowly down its potential @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these models assume that the vacuum energy can vary ; a feature discussed much earlier @xcite .",
    "other alternatives include @xmath4-essence @xcite , phantom energy models @xcite , _ cosmon _",
    "fields @xcite , and also several modifications of gravity @xcite .    a challenging related issue concerns models of mass varying particles @xcite .",
    "these are coupled to a light scalar field that drives their energy through their dynamical mass .",
    "the idea of this mass varying mechanism @xcite is to introduce a coupling between a relic particle , usually neutrinos , and the dark sector : dark energy or dark matter separately , or all together @xcite .",
    "such models admit an adiabatic regime in which the scalar field , usually related with dark energy , rolls down the minimum of its effective potential , which is set by the dark matter dynamical mass . as a direct consequence of this new interaction , the particle mass",
    "is altered by the dynamics of the scalar field .",
    "due to phenomenological reasons , one still expects a small contribution from neutrinos to the cosmic dynamics .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that the active neutrino masses are tiny as compared to the masses of the charged fermions .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino masses is usually understood in terms of the _ seesaw _ mechanism in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of the electroweak ( ew ) interactions .",
    "the ew interactions involve only _ left _ handed neutrinos such that no renormalizable mass term for them is compatible with the sm gauge symmetry @xmath5 . once one assumes the conservation of baryon and lepton numbers , the _ seesaw _ mechanism admits neutrino masses from dimension five operators .",
    "neutrino masses should then involve two powers of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs doublet .",
    "these masses are suppressed by the inverse power of a large mass scale , @xmath6 , of a _",
    "right _ handed majorana neutrino .",
    "this super - heavy majorana neutrino is associated to lepton number violating effects in extensions of the sm .",
    "assuming that the sterile neutrino mass , @xmath7 , exhibits a dynamical behavior driven by the scalar field , @xmath2 , then the sterile neutrino becomes an interesting candidate for the aforementioned mass varying dark matter .",
    "this , through the _ seesaw _ mechanism , gives origin to a mass varying neutrino ( mavan ) @xcite component corresponding to active neutrinos that exhibit secondary mass effects due to the _ seesaw _ mechanism . in models of coupled dark energy , in which the scalar field couples to other matter components , it is natural to expect a coupling to active and to sterile neutrinos .    in this work ,",
    "one explores the consequences of such a coupling .",
    "this leads to cosmological scaling solutions where dark energy tracks the evolution of matter and/or radiation . for the present cosmological epoch",
    ", it is predicted that the energy densities of dark energy and matter are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "if the tracking can be altered by the growing mass of neutrinos , such that they become nonrelativistic ( nr ) at low redshift , one can interestingly match the observed universe .",
    "one should notice that mass varying dark matter is unusual in the formulation of the mavan models .",
    "the unification of dark energy and dark matter naturally offers this possibility .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) is particularly relevant in this respect @xcite as it is shown to be consistent with the observational constraints from cmb @xcite , supernova @xcite , gravitational lensing surveys @xcite , and gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "once one sets the mass dependence on @xmath2 , the dark sector scalar field , one notices that the cosmological evolution of the unified fluid composed by mass varying dark matter and evolving dark energy has a dynamics similar to that of the _ cosmon _ field @xcite .",
    "thus , at least partially , it turns out that the mass varying mechanism is the main agent of stability and of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "any cosmological fluid which effectively reproduces the effects of the gcg naturally offers analogous possibilities @xcite .",
    "assuming that the scalar field drives the behavior of the masses of active and sterile neutrinos , the mass varying mechanism and the conditions for a stable cosmological scenario naturally emerges in the context of the gcc model .",
    "remarkably , the _ seesaw _ masses and energy densities of active and sterile neutrinos can be consistently embedded in the gcg scenario without any additional assumption .",
    "such a connection is mediated by a mass scale , @xmath0 , and a dimensionless scale , @xmath1 , similarly to _ cosmon_-type dynamical equations @xcite .",
    "these are dubbed as _ seesaw cosmon _ equations .",
    "this procedure gives origin to a remarkable convergence of three distinct frameworks : the _ cosmon_-like dynamics , the _ seesaw _ mechanism for mass generation and the gcg scenario .",
    "the equation of state of the perturbations is the very one of the background cosmology so that all effective results arising from the gcg model are maintained , although modified by neutrinos in a quite subtle way .",
    "this work is organized as follows . the decoupling mechanism for active and sterile neutrinos",
    "is described in section ii .",
    "this is obtained through the coupling of a scalar field in the _ seesaw _ relations , which leads to the dynamical properties ensued by the mass varying mechanism . in section iii",

    "the main properties of a unified treatment of dark matter and dark energy in a dark energy scenario for a @xmath8-like equation of state , @xmath9 , is reviewed .",

    "specifical mass dependencies on the scalar field for which the mass varying dark matter results in an _ effective _ gcg model are discussed .",

    "however , this scenario is not unique",
    ". nevertheless , without any additional assumptions , it provides an attractive solution for the coincidence problem through the confluence of three independent frameworks : the _ cosmon_-like dynamics , the _ seesaw _ mechanism for mass generation and the gcg model . for active neutrinos ,",
    "an increase of the mass @xmath20 by a factor @xmath160 , corresponds approximately to a decrease of the sterile neutrino mass @xmath21 from the planck scale to @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the gcg model modulates the increase of the neutrino mass , which acts as a cosmological clock to the present scenario of cosmological accelerated expansion .    unfortunately ,",
    "in general , one can not provide a sharp criterion for the potential and for the mass varying dependence on the scalar field to discriminate between the gcg scenario and a unified fluid via a _ seesaw cosmon _",
    "field that mimics the gcg .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown for specific potentials that , in what concerns stability and cosmic acceleration , many results found in the literature can be recovered . actually , new scenarios featuring other mass dependencies on the _ seesaw cosmon _ field can also be considered .",
    "to conclude , the proposed unified scheme , despite similarities with some quintessence models , is an ambitious and encompassing scheme where mass varying particles can be related with the stability and the cosmic acceleration of the universe .",

    "aiming to understand how the mass varying behavior takes place , it is assumed that for a particle statistical distribution @xmath162 , where @xmath163 , @xmath164 being the background temperature at present , in a flat frw cosmological scenario . for a generic dynamical mass defined by @xmath165 , the corresponding particle density , energy density and pressure are expressed as @xmath166 where one has introduced the sub - index @xmath167 for denoting present - day values , with @xmath168 .    in the limit where @xmath169 tends to @xmath167 ,",
    "the fermi distribution @xmath162 becomes a step function that yields an elementary integral with the upper limit equal to the fermi momentum @xmath170 .",
