    "the isostructural @xmath2 transition in fcc ce attracts a renewed interest @xcite .",
    "ce undergoes a volume reduction of up to 17 percent from the magnetically disordered @xmath0-phase to a non magnetic ( nm ) low volume @xmath3-phase at low pressure , @xmath4 , at a temperature @xmath1 of about 300 k , even though a competing dhcp phase , @xmath5 , appears @xcite at lower @xmath1 for zero @xmath4 .",
    "the transition moves to higher @xmath1 for higher @xmath4 ; at @xmath6 20 kbar it reaches almost 600 k with a vanishing volume reduction .",
    "several models have been proposed to drive the transition , the kondo volume - collapse model @xcite , a mott transition @xcite , correlation and entropy @xcite , or via standard density - functional theory ( dft ) bands with entropies @xcite .",
    "the t - dependence is the unusual feature of the transition . at @xmath7",
    "only the @xmath3-phase is stable .",
    "nevertheless , a recent work proposed that the df - potential should be replaced by a different hybrid exchange - correlation potential , with enhanced correlation , since calculations at @xmath7 compare favorably with measured extrapolation of to a negative transition pressure @xcite .",
    "there are two groups of models containing more or less of correlation .",
    "either they conclude that ce is a strongly correlated system , where dft is not sufficient , or otherwise they suggest that dft is applicable , but that the band structure information has to be complemented by entropy @xcite .",
    "in fact , dft - calculations based on the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite , and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite , both give a qualitatively correct account of the t - dependence of the @xmath2 transition if the entropies are included @xcite , but gga is quantitatively better @xcite .",
    "none of these dft - potentials include particular on - site correlation beyond the normal correlation within the electron gas .",
    "independently of this , it has been shown that effects from thermal disorder and zero - point motion ( zpm ) are important for the band structure and properties in materials with sharp density - of - states ( dos ) variations near the fermi energy ( @xmath8 ) . in such cases",
    "it is necessary to include disorder into the electronic structure calculations for a correct description of the physical properties or spectroscopic responses @xcite .",
    "magnetic manifestations of coupling between lattice distortions and electronic structures show up as spin - phonon coupling in cuprates @xcite and spin - lattice interactions giving invariant thermal expansion in invar materials @xcite .",
    "ce is , a priori , a system where disorder could be important , because the dos of the f - band raises sharply at @xmath8 , and the lattice is fairly soft , which makes large distortion amplitudes of atomic vibrations already at low t. in the present work we investigate the importance of lattice disorder for the properties of ce and its transition between the magnetic and the non - magnetic phase .",
    "self - consistent linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) band calculations @xcite have been made for 32-atom unit cells , 2x2x2 extensions of the cubic fcc 4-atom cell , of fcc ce for several lattice constants ( @xmath9 ) between 4.85 and 5.42   .",
    "the gga potential is used @xcite .",
    "calculations are also made for the ordinary ( ordered ) fcc 1 atom / cell for @xmath9 between 4.75 and 5.4   .",
    "the number of k - points is 75 in half of the brillouin zone ( bz ) for the large cell , and 505 in 1/48 bz for the small cell .",
    "the 6s , 5p , 5d and 4f valence electrons are included in the basis .",
    "magnetic moments and dos functions are very similar in these two sets of calculations for ordered structure .",
    "each atomic position in the 32 atom / cell is randomly displaced in the calculations with thermal disorder so that the averaged displacement amplitudes follow a gaussian distribution function with width @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this distribution is valid at not too large @xmath1 , when there are no correlated movements of the neighboring atoms @xcite .",
    "the average lattice displacement @xmath11 is related to @xmath1 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the atomic weight and @xmath14 an averaged phonon frequency .",
    "zpm remains at @xmath1 well below the debye temperature , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is never smaller than @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "from the measured @xmath15 of about 115 k for @xmath0-ce and 160 k for the high-@xmath4 room temperature ( rt ) @xmath3-phase @xcite we can estimate that @xmath18 is of the order 0.01 - 0.013 , and that @xmath19 at rt is about 0.021 - 0.028 for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the band calculations are made for several disordered 32-cell configurations with @xmath10 from 0.021 up to 0.063 , which correspond to a temperature range between approximately 200 k and 800 k. for comparison we note that @xmath11 would be about 0.22 of the atomic sphere radius according to the lindemann criterion for the melting temperature , @xmath20 @xcite , i.e. @xmath10 would be of the order 0.086 .",
    "this fits with our @xmath1-calibration of @xmath10 , since @xmath20 is near 1050 k for ce @xcite .",
    "the band structure is sensitive to disorder ( and zpm ) because of the fluctuations of the potential in a vibrating disordered lattice .",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath21 at a point @xmath22 within a site @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the nuclear charges on sites @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the electron charge density , and the sum and integral cover all space .",
    "the contribution to @xmath21 from its own site ( with radius @xmath28 ) can be separated from the contribution from the surrounding lattice through the technique of ewald lattice summation @xcite : @xmath29 thus , the coulomb interaction with the outside lattice is condensed into a madelung shift , @xmath30 .",
    "this shift is identical for all sites if the lattice is perfectly ordered .",
    "but different sites have different @xmath30 in a disordered lattice , partly because of the local differences in atomic positions and partly because of the charge transfers induced by the disorder .",
    "thus , the potentials at different sites are slightly different and they vary in time .",
    "phonons are very slow compared to the electronic time scale and the electronic structure can relax adiabatically .",
    "the band results for two different configurations with almost the same @xmath10 are comparable , which indicates that the 32-atom cells are large enough for simulation of disorder .",
    "other details of the calculational method can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "calculations for the ordered cell , and for the 1-atom fcc cell , show that a ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state develops when the lattice constant @xmath9 exceeds about 5.2    @xcite .",
    "the ground state solutions shift easily between a low - magnetic ( @xmath31 ) and a high - magnetic state ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) when @xmath34  .",
    "the state at the absolute minimum of the total energy @xmath35 is non - magnetic ( nm ) , near @xmath36 , compared to 4.62    when using lsda @xcite .",
    "the experimental values at rt are near 4.85     and 5.16     for the @xmath3- and @xmath0-phase , respectively @xcite . from the stoner model",
    "it is expected that fm develops at large volume , when the band narrowing makes @xmath37 larger .",
    "the gain in exchange energy overcomes the loss of kinetic energy at the fm transition @xcite , but the coulomb interaction can make small corrections to this energy balance @xcite .",
    "these effects are included in the self - consistent , spin - polarized calculations .",
    "structural disorder introduces local volume fluctuations , and the degree of localization of f - electrons depends directly on the surroundings . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is shown an example of the correlation between local volume variations ( @xmath38 , which is defined as the average of the 12 nearest - neigbor distances around each of the 32 sites ) , and the site decomposed @xmath37-values , as well as the local moments , for a case with @xmath39 , @xmath9=5.29  . as seen ,",
    "when @xmath38 is considerably larger ( @xmath40 0.72 ) than the value for ordered lattice ( 0.7071 ) , @xmath37 and @xmath32 are highest .",
    "the valence charge per ce varies quite linearly from 10.4 el./ce for the sites with the lowest moment to about 9.7 el./ce when the moment is just above 1 @xmath41/ce .",
    "disorder has a supplementary effect on the average moment if the lattice constant is below the critical value for a high moment : since the local volume and the moments are increased on many of the sites with large @xmath38 , it leads to an increase of the total fm moment of the cell . that some of the sites are `` compressed '' ( small @xmath38 ) does not reduce the total moment , because their local moments are small already in the ordered lattice .",
    "oppositely , at large @xmath9 when the moment for the ordered structure is close to its maximum , about 1.1 @xmath42 , there is no ( or very little ) effect on the total moment from disorder .",
    "the saturation of the total spin moment near 1 @xmath42 for one occupied f - electron can be understood from hund s first rule .",
    "thus , disorder fluctuations can not make the local moment much higher even if the local volume is increased , but local compressions could rather decrease the moment .",
    "this explains the saturation of the highest local moments seen in fig [ fig1 ] for the sites with the highest @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "[ figcem ] displays the averaged @xmath43 for different distortion amplitudes . as seen , near the transition region",
    "there are large effects on magnetism because of lattice disorder .",
    "magnetism appears suddenly at @xmath44     for the ordered structure , but is much more gradual and starts at lower volume when the disorder is large .",
    "therfore , vibrational disorder is crucial for a good understanding of the properties of ce .",
    "all self - consistent calculations start from the potential for the ordered structure .",
    "the final fm configurations converge gradually during the iterations . in a few cases ,",
    "usually when the magnetic moments are small , it is possible to find sites where the spin orientation is opposite to the majority moments , as if anti - ferromagnetism ( afm ) was installed locally .",
    "these solutions develop very slowly , but they seem not to concern large - moment cases at large volume and large temperature . therefore , such solutions are not important for the free - energy arguments in the next section . the tendencies for local afm diminish when the electronic temperature is raised .",
    "thus , smearing due to the fermi - dirac distribution is not favorable to spin flips , while details in the local environment caused by lattice disorder can be so .",

    "`` compressed '' sites with small @xmath38 have small @xmath37 and @xmath32 .",

    "the difference in vibrational free energy at two volumes @xmath49 is @xmath50 where the debye temperatures @xmath51 are closely related to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the bulk moduli of the two phases .",
    "the latter are calculated to be in the range 15 - 20 gpa for fm ce and 20 - 30 gpa for nm ce .",
    "this agrees with experiment @xcite , but it is delicate to determine the full @xmath54-dependence from @xmath55 calculations because of the sharp drop of @xmath53 at the transition . here",
    "we choose to fit @xmath15 to the experimental results in ref .",
    "this gives @xmath56 ( in @xmath57 ) .",
    "the last term makes the continuous decrease of @xmath15 from about 160@xmath57 at small volume to about 140k at large volume .",
    "this is the typical behavior in almost all materials , since @xmath58 normally decreases with increasing volume .",
    "the second term is introduced in order to include a sharp discontinuity ( @xmath59 ) in @xmath15 at the transition when @xmath32 is close to 0.5 @xmath41/atom .",
    "thus , vibrations favor the @xmath0-phase because of its softer lattice .",

    "the disordered case has @xmath10=0.04.,width=302,height=226 ]    the electronic entropy is calculated as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the electronic density - of - states and @xmath62 the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this quantity is almost proportional to @xmath37 ( @xmath63 ) , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , disorder makes @xmath37 larger .",
    "the calculated @xmath64 favors the @xmath0 phase even more than what was found in ref @xcite , because of disorder .",
    "a large entropy comes from fluctuations of magnetic moments , @xmath65\\ ] ] which includes an orbital moment @xmath66 , and a spin part being half of the magnetic moment , @xmath67 .",
    "a full moment of a single f - electron makes @xmath66=3 according to hund s first rule .",
    "here we apply atomic - like paschen - back calculations , which for the spin - orbit coupling in ce - f give @xmath68 for @xmath691 @xcite .",
    "the moments @xmath66 and @xmath32 make a substantial entropy contribution at large @xmath1 , which stabilizes the @xmath0-phase depending on the evolution of @xmath70 . without consideration of disorder @xmath70",
    "follows the thin full line in fig .",
    "[ figcem ] , which is the basis for the result in ref . @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ figcem ] , disorder moves the magnetic transition towards lower volume .",

    "entropy from phase mixing @xcite is not accounted for in the present work .     in @xmath71 ) as function of the lattice constant , @xmath9 .",
    "the ( blue ) thin full line shows the total free energy at low @xmath1 , when the disorder is dominated by zpm .",
    "the subsequent lines show the results at 400k , 600k and 800k , respectively .",
    "the small vertical arrows indicate the volumes where the average magnetic moment exceeds 0.5 @xmath41 per atom.,width=302,height=226 ]    the electronic ( @xmath72 ) free energy is calculated from the 1 atom / cell results with t - dependences entering through the fermi - dirac distribution and a dos broadening .",
    "the two phases do not co - exist at equal volumes .",
    "the minimum of @xmath73 at 4.79     is for nm @xmath3-ce .",
    "fm grows gradually as @xmath74 5.2   , but there is no second local minimum of @xmath73 even if there is some lowering of @xmath73 beyond 5.3   , see fig [ figet ] . the signature of fm , seen the electronic free energy curve , moves to lower volume because of higher moments when @xmath1 increases .",
    "disorder at @xmath75 makes moments to appear already below @xmath76 5   .",
    "the next step is to add the vibrational entropy and magnetic entropies from the disordered large cell calculations ( scaled by 1/32 ) to the electronic free energies from the 1 atom / cell results .",
    "the results for @xmath1 between 200 and 800 k are shown in fig [ figet ] .",
    "the crossover from the nm low volume phase to the fm fluctuating phase at large volume ( @xmath9 in the range 5.1 - 5.15   ) occurs just below 600 k. these results are in closer agreement with experiment than in the calculations without consideration of disorder @xcite .",
    "the electronic total energy goes down with increasing moment , and the onset of magnetism ( indicated by the arrows in fig [ figet ] ) is seen to coincide with a small discontinuity in the @xmath77-curves , which moves towards lower volume as @xmath1 is increasing . since the average moments in the disordered ( supercell ) results are higher than the moments in ordered ce , it can be expected that the @xmath0-phase will be stabilized further .    as noted earlier ,",
    "the equilibrium volume for the nm ground state is better from gga than from lsda . since the crossover to the high volume fm state occurs at a reasonable t , when using free energies from gga , gives us confidence that gga is reliable also in the fm regime .",
    "results using gga+u ( and lsda+u ) have the total energies for the fm state lower than for the nm state already at @xmath7 when u is large , which is incorrect @xcite .",
    "other properties such as moments and dos at @xmath8 seem to depend less on the exact choice of u @xcite , so the free energy contribution at large @xmath1 should be comparable to the present results .",
    "thus , consideration of disorder and entropies in addition to gga+u could easily destroy the good @xmath1-dependence if correlation is imposed by having u larger than @xmath61 ev .",
    "core level energies are probes of potential shifts and can be used to measure effects of disorder and magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the local variations of exchange splitting ( proportional to the local magnetic moments ) and madelung shifts caused by disorder show up as broadening of spectroscopic ensembles of core levels .",
    "this opens a possibility for core level spectroscopy to identify the effects of disorder .",
    "for instance , in the nm high pressure @xmath3-phase at rt , disorder is calculated to make a broadening of the 4s level of about 0.16 ev . by removing the pressure ( but keeping @xmath1 constant ) to get the magnetic @xmath0-phase",
    ", these levels broaden to about 0.42 ev because of the variations of the local moments ( the averaged moment is 0.36 @xmath42 ) . without disorder",
    "there would be no variations of the madelung shifts , and identical exchange splittings on all sites should produce two sharp lines separated by 0.16 ev for a moment of 0.36 @xmath42 .",
    "the broadening from disorder is too large for a clear identification of separated spin up and down peaks .",
    "these broadenings do not include other smearing mechanisms due to the experimental method or other types of lattice imperfections .",
    "the madelung shifts and exchange splitting of the 4p and 4d levels are comparable , with spin - orbit splittings of 18.9 and 3.3 ev , respectively .",
    "all entropies contribute to a crossover from the @xmath3- to the @xmath0-phase at about 800 k when using gga without effects from disorder @xcite . here , with disorder",
    ", the transition is calculated to occur below 600k , at a volume in better agreement with experiment .",
    "entropies and the effects of disorder exist always , and they should be considered even in calculations based on strong correlation .",
    "the behavior at @xmath7 is not certain , especially because of the dhcp @xmath5-phase that replaces the @xmath0-phase at low @xmath1 on the @xmath78 line @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , ignoring this and doing an extrapolation towards low @xmath1 on the @xmath2 separation line of the phase diagram suggests a negative transition pressure at @xmath7 .",
    "this can be taken as a support for potentials with large correlation @xcite , but it is not clear how of such results will behave at high @xmath1 .",
    "most observations of the @xmath2 transition are made in the range 150 - 450 k , and it is important to test theoretical results in the similar temperature range .",
    "the fact that the transition can be described quite accurately by temperature dependent dft calculations with thermal disorder and entropies , is a strong support for standard dft .",
    "note that dft has been applied successfully to a vast amount of metallic systems without relying on adjustable parameters for correlation .",
    "finally , ce can be added to the list of materials where thermal disorder is seen to be important for the physical properties ."
