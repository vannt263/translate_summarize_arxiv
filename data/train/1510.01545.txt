    "as mobile operators are faced with increasingly demanding requirements in terms of data rates and operational costs , the novel architecture of cloud radio access networks ( c - rans ) has emerged as a promising solution @xcite,@xcite . in a c - ran , the baseband processing of the base stations is migrated to a central unit ( cu ) in the  cloud \" , to which the base station , typically referred to an remote radio heads ( rrhs ) , are connected via fronthaul links , which in turn may be realized via fiber optics , microwave or mmwave technologies . by simplifying the network edge and by centralizing baseband processing , the c - ran architecture is expected to provide significant benefits in energy efficiency , load balancing , and interference management capabilities ( see review in @xcite )    a key problem in c - rans is that of devising effective baseband compression methods in order to cope with the limitation in the capacity of the fronthaul links .",
    "most theoretical works on the subject implicitly assume perfect time synchronization and channel state    information ( csi ) at the rrhs and the cu ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "however , on the one hand , this assumption violates the c - ran paradigm that minimal baseband processing should be carried out at the bss , and , on the other hand , the resulting design neglects the additional requirements on fronthaul processing at the rrhs that are imposed by synchronization and channel estimation .",
    "this limitation is alleviated by @xcite , which considers robust compression in the presence of imperfect csi , and by papers @xcite@xcite , which study the impact of fronthaul compression on channel estimation . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "analysis that account for imperfect time synchronization are instead not available .    in this paper , we consider training - based synchronization for the uplink of a c - ran cellular system .",
    "specifically , we investigate the problem of optimal fronthaul compression of the training field with the aim of enhancing the performance of time and phase synchronization at the cu . to this end ,",
    "the effect of the synchronization error on the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is analyzed by adopting the cramer - rao bound ( crb ) as the performance criterion of interest and by accounting for compression via information theoretic tools .",
    "the resulting proposed algorithm is based on the charnes - cooper transformation @xcite and the difference of convex ( dc ) approach @xcite .",
    "numerical results show that optimized fronthaul compression that targets enhanced synchronization performance outperforms conventional solution that do not account for the impact of synchronization errors .",
