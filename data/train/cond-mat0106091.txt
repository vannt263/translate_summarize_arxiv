    "at strong magnetic fields and for sufficiently small separation between the wells , the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a double quantum well system ( dqws ) can have a broken symmetry ground state with a non zero interlayer phase coherence even in the absence of tunneling . at filling factor @xmath0 , the quantum hall effect",
    "is observed in such coherent state when the separation between the wells does not exceed some critical value @xmath2 above which the coherence is lost and the 2deg becomes compressible . in dqws systems ,",
    "the interlayer phase coherence gives rise to a rich variety of quantum and finite - temperature phase transitions as well as to some exotic topological excitations such as merons and bimerons .",
    "some of these various phases and excitations are reviewed in details in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite .",
    "one convenient way to describe the coherent ground states of the 2deg in a dqws is by using a mapping to an equivalent spin-1/2 system . in these states ,",
    "the real spins are assumed completely frozen and , in the pseudospin language , an electron in the left(right ) layer is equated with an up(down ) pseudospin .",
    "quantum mechanics allows for any linear superposition of these states and the corresponding pseudospin can point in any direction in space .",
    "an interesting phase transition , first reported by murphy et al.@xcite , occurs when , at filling factor @xmath0 , the sample is tilted with respect to the quantizing magnetic field .",
    "a study of the behavior of the activation gap as the sample is tilted shows evidence for a phase transition between two competing quantum hall ground states .",
    "yang et al.@xcite explained this change of behavior as a transition between a commensurate and an incommensurate ground states .",
    "this transition can be briefly described in the following way . in a suitable gauge ,",
    "the tunneling amplitude modified by the parallel component of the magnetic field acts as an effective magnetic field for the pseudospins .",
    "this effective field rotates in space with a wavevector given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the separation between the wells and @xmath5 is the magnetic length for the parallel magnetic field . for @xmath6 the pseudospins that are forced to ly in the plane of the wells to minimize the capacitive energy",
    "will locally align with this effective magnetic field .",
    "this is the commensurate ( c ) state . as the period of the field increases ,",
    "however , the gain in tunneling energy obtained by aligning with the field is opposed by the cost in exchange energy of having non parallel pseudospins . at a critical field ,",
    "the exchange energy exceeds the tunneling energy and the pseudospins cease to rotate with the effective field , behaving almost as if @xmath7 but , this incommensurate ( i ) state is never the ground state of the system . above some critical parallel field or wavevector @xmath8",
    ", the c state has defects in the form of sine - gordon solitons where the phase of the pseudospin slips by @xmath9 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the ground state of the systems is a lattice of these kinks , a soliton - lattice state ( sls ) .",
    "apart from the orignal experiment of murphy et al . there has been no other experimental signature of the sls .",
    "on the theoretical side , hanna et al.hanna have discussed the possibility of detecting this lattice by surface acoustic wave technique or by measuring the small contribution of the sls to the parallel - field magnetization of the dqws .",
    "some possible ways of detecting the pseudospin phase solitons in a dqws have also been described by kyriakidis _ et al_.@xcite read@xcite has described in details the behavior of the energy gap near the c - i transition .",
    "some details of the absorption spectrum but in the absence of a parallel magnetic field has already been worked out by joglekar _",
    "et al_@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we explore another possible signature of the sls .",
    "building on earlier work@xcite where we derived the collective excitations of the sls ground state , we compute the signature of these collective modes in an absorption experiment .",
    "our basic idea is the following .",
    "the dispersion relation of the collective mode in the sls has many branches .",
    "the lowest - energy branch corresponds to the goldstone mode that restores the broken translational symmetry .",
    "the higher - energy branches have non - zero frequencies at zero wavector .",
    "they ( as well as the goldstone mode ) involve motion of the @xmath11 component of the pseudospins , a component that is related to changes in the charge density balance between the two layers .",
    "these modes can be excited by an external electromagnetic wave .",
    "a nice feature of the sls is that simply changing the magnitude of the parallel magnetic field ( _ i.e_. tilting the sample ) modifies the period of the lattice and , consequently , the set of frequencies at zero wavevector . in principle",
    ", it could be possible to track the complete dispersion relation of the pseudospin collective modes by measuring the absorption as the parallel magnetic field is changed .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section",
    "ii , we relate the electromagnetic absorption to the polarisation tensor of the dqws . in section iii",
    ", we derive an expression for this polarisation tensor in terms of the @xmath11 component of the pseudospin .",
    "section iv gives a brief review of the commensurate - incommensurate transition . in section",
    "v and vi , we compute the absorption in the c , i and sl states and comment on the possibility of experimentally observing the resulting spectrum .",
    "the coherent ground states of the 2deg in a qdws are characterized by spatial modulations of one or several of their order parameters . if we specify a pseudospin configuration by the spherical - coordinate fields @xmath12 which describes the difference in charge density between the layers , and @xmath13 which describes the relative phase of electrons in the right and left wells , then the slsground state has spatial modulations in @xmath14 only and @xmath15 everywhere .",

    "<S> when the separation between layers in a double - quantum - well system is sufficiently small , the ground state of the two - dimensional electron gas at filling factor @xmath0 has an interwell phase coherence even in the absence of tunneling . for non - zero tunneling , </S>",
    "<S> this coherent state goes through a commensurate - incommensurate transition as the sample is tilted with respect to the quantizing magnetic field at @xmath1 . in this article , we compute the optical ( infrared ) absorption spectrum of the coherent state from the commensurate state at small tilt angle to the soliton - lattice state at larger tilt angle and comment on the possibility of observing experimentally the distinctive signature of the soliton lattice .    </S>",
