    "recently , some algebraic approaches to integer programming problems have been studied .",
    "the two main approaches are using _ grbner bases _  @xcite and _ standard pair decompositions _  @xcite .",
    "although they neither give improved complexity bounds compared with existing methods nor have been demonstrated to solve hard practical instances which can not be handled by existing methods , these approaches themselves are very interesting by applying computational algebraic methods to such hard problems , and give algebraic analysis of structure of integer programming problems  @xcite . for an ideal over a polynomial ring , the reduced grbner basis and the set of standard pairs are dual in a sense that the complement of the monomials in the initial ideal , which is generated by initial terms of the reduced grbner basis , is the set of standard monomials , whose nice decomposition is the standard pair decomposition .",
    "this kind of duality may shed new light on duality in combinatorial optimization , and by considering a nice subclass of integer programming problems where the duality theorem holds , we might be able to obtain some complexity bounds by making use of the characteristics of the subclass , which could not be derived for general integer programming problems .    the problems whose coefficient matrices are unimodular form a nice subclass in a sense that the system @xmath2 becomes totally dual integral ( tdi ) .",
    "then each standard pair corresponds to a dual feasible basis , and the method using standard pairs is equivalent to calculate the reduced cost for each basis  ( theorem  [ thm : red_cost ] ) .",
    "thus , the number of standard pairs , which is equal to that of dual feasible bases , gives the complexity of this approach .",
    "additionally , the maximum number of standard pairs can be described by the normalized volume of another matrix  ( theorem  [ thm : maxvolume ] ) .    especially , the minimum cost flow problems form a well - known subclass of unimodular integer programming problems which can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "a grbner basis approach for the minimum cost flow problems is a variant of cycle - canceling algorithm . in the case of the strongly polynomial time",
    "algorithms  @xcite , for any feasible flow they choose polynomial size of negative - cost cycles ( by the selecting rules ) from the set of negative - cost cycles in the residual network , which may be of exponential size , as many as possible .",
    "similarly , the algorithm using grbner basis calculates the optimal flow by augmenting flows along the negative - cost cycles which correspond to the elements of grbner basis .",
    "thus the cardinalities of reduced grbner bases may give some time bound for this algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , a standard pair approach for the minimum cost flow problems first finds the set of standard pairs , and solves linear system of equations for each standard pair until an integer and non - negative solution is obtained . for a network optimization problem , the duality between the reduced grbner basis and the set of standard pairs corresponds to the relation between circuits and dual feasible co - trees , dually , cutsets and primal feasible trees .",
    "since such a relation has not been so clear , the computational algebraic duality may be interesting method for the analysis of network problems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "reduced grbner bases and standard pairs are defined , and their relations with integer programming problems , regular triangulations and dual polyhedra are introduced . the case that the coefficient matrix is unimodular",
    "is studied in section 3 . the maximum arithmetic degree ( i.e. the maximum number of dual feasible bases ) is shown to be the normalized volume of a polytope defined by homogenizing the coefficient matrix   ( theorem  [ thm : maxvolume ] ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we study the grbner bases and standard pairs on the primal minimum cost flow problems on acyclic tournament graphs with @xmath3 vertices .",
    "we show that three types of reduced grbner bases can be characterized in terms of the circuits  ( theorem  [ thm : grob_p_type1 ] ,  [ thm : grob_p_type2],[thm : grob_p_type3 ] ) .",
    "these examples give the minimum and the maximum number of dual feasible bases of the minimum cost flow problems : the minimum is 1  ( theorem  [ thm : min_arith_degree ] ) and the maximum is @xmath0(theorem  [ thm : max_arith_degree ] ) .",
    "this maximum is shown using the result in section 3 and the result about the hypergeometric system on unipotent matrices and related polytope  @xcite . in section 5",
    ", we study the dual minimum cost flow problems .",
    "one reduced grbner basis is characterized in terms of cutsets(theorem  [ thm : grob_d ] ) .",
    "we also show that the lower bound for the number of primal feasible bases of the minimum cost flow problems is @xmath1 .",
    ".dual algebraic approaches for primal and dual minimum cost flow problems [ cols=\"^,^ , < , < \" , ]     [ table : del_in_vars2 ]    for a binomial @xmath4 which corresponds to the cutset @xmath5 for @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 corresponds to arcs from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( otherwise , @xmath12 can be reduced by @xmath13 , which contradicts the assumption of the induction ) .",
    "then @xmath14 can be reduced by @xmath13 , and the resulting monomial is @xmath15  ( see table 4 ) , which contradicts to the definition of a term order by @xmath16 .    similarly , in the case that @xmath15 can be reduced by @xmath17 for some @xmath18 , using the same @xmath19 and @xmath4 which corresponds to the cutset @xmath5 for @xmath6 such that @xmath20 , and @xmath8 , we can show the contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a desired spanning tree @xmath23 .",
