    "a stochastic background of the relic gravitational waves ( rgws ) , generated during the very early stage of the universe @xcite , is a necessity dictated by general relativity and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the rgws have a wide range spreading spectra @xcite , and their detection plays a double role in relativity and cosmology .",
    "one of the important methods for the detection of rgws is by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectra , including the temperature anisotropies ( @xmath2 ) power spectrum , the polarization ( @xmath4 and @xmath1 ) power spectra , and the cross - correlation ( @xmath3 ) power spectrum @xcite . by observing the lower - order cmb multipoles",
    ", one can detect the signal of rgws at the very low frequencies ( @xmath8 hz ) .",
    "one has to note , besides the gravitational waves of quantum - mechanical origin @xcite , the classical gravitational waves were generated at later stages of cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "however , their wavelengths are much shorter than the present hubble radius and therefore they do not affect the lower - order cmb multipoles .    as well known , the cmb has certain degree of polarization generated via thompson scattering during the decoupling in the early universe @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the rgws are present at the photon decoupling in the universe , the magnetic type of polarization ( @xmath9-polarization ) will be produced @xcite .",
    "this would be a characteristic feature of rgws on very large scale , since the density perturbations will not generate this polarization .",
    "so a natural way for the detection of rgws is by observing the signal of @xmath9-polarization of cmb .",
    "this is the so - called  _ bb _ \" method .",
    "however , the amplitude of the @xmath9-polarization is expected to be very small .",
    "in addition , the @xmath9-polarization is prone to degradation by various systematic effects on a wide range of scales @xcite .",
    "the current 5-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap5 ) observation only gives an upper limit @xmath10k@xmath11 ( @xmath12c.l.)@xcite . the forthcoming projects , such as the planck @xcite , clover @xcite , spider @xcite , quite @xcite , are expected to be much more sensitive for the detection of the cmb @xmath9-polarization .",
    "due to the disadvantage of  _ bb _ \" method , it is necessary to look for the new method for the detection of rgws in the cmb . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", the authors found that , in the large scale @xmath13 , the rgws generate the negative @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "however , if the @xmath3 spectrum is generated by density perturbations , it should be positive .",
    "this suggests that the signal of rgws can also be detected by the cmb @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "comparing with the @xmath9-polarization , the amplitude of the @xmath3 spectrum is nearly two order larger . in the works @xcite ,",
    "the authors have developed several ways to detect the signal of rgws directly from the cmb @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "these are the so - called  _ te _ \" method .    in the work @xcite we found the wmap5 @xmath3 data",
    "contains a hint of the presence of rgws contribution . in terms of quadrupole ratio @xmath14 ,",
    "the best - fit model produced @xmath15 , which corresponds to the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath16 . because of large residual noise , the uncertainty of this determination is still large",
    ". we also found , if considering the planck instrumental noises ,  _ te _ \" method can detect the signal of rgws at 2@xmath17 level when @xmath18 . if considering the ideal case with full sky and no noise ,  _ te _ \" method can detect the rgws at 2@xmath17 level when @xmath19 . by comparing the detection abilities of  _ te _ \" and  _ bb _ \" methods",
    ", we found that , taking into account of the instrumental noises of planck satellite ,  _",
    "bb _ \" method is more sensitive when @xmath20 is small .",
    "however , if the noise power spectra or the amplitudes of rgws increase , the sensitivity of  _ te _ \" method becomes better than that of  _ bb _ \" method .    in this paper",
    ", we shall extend the  _ te _ \" method in our previous work @xcite . by calculating the values of @xmath0",
    ", we shall compare the detection abilities for the rgws in the following four cases .",
    "the first case (  _ b _ \" case ) is the so - called  _ bb _ \" method , where only the @xmath9-polarization spectrum is considered . in the second case , we include not only the cmb @xmath3 spectrum , but also the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "we call it as the  _ ct _ \" case (  c \" standing for the cross - correlation power spectrum and  t \" standing for the temperature anisotropies power spectrum )",
    ". we shall expect that , taking into account the contribution of @xmath2 spectrum , the detection ability will be much improved . in the third case , besides @xmath3 and @xmath2 spectra , we also include the @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "we call it as the  _ cte _ \" case .",
    "the fourth one is the  _ cteb _ \" case , where the contributions of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 power spectra are all considered .",
    "the detection ability in this case is expected to be much more sensitive than the other three cases .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , the primordial power spectra of rgws and density perturbations , the cmb power spectra and the corresponding estimators are introduced . in this section , the probability density functions ( pdfs ) for the estimators are also discussed . in section iii , we introduce four (  _ b _ \" ,  ct \" ,  _ cte _ \" and  _ cteb _ \" ) cases for the detection of rgws in the cmb .",
    "the likelihood functions are also given this section .",
    "in section iv , by constructing the likelihood functions based on the simulated data , we shall investigate the values of the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 in these four cases .",
    "this quantity describes the detection abilities of rgws in the different cases .",
    "we firstly introduce the simulation method . in the simulation ,",
    "when constructing the likelihood functions , we only consider one free cosmic parameter , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath20 .",
    "we find when @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , the signal of rgws can be detected in  _ b _ \" (  _ ct _ \" ,  _ cte _ \" ,  _ cteb _ \" ) case at @xmath25 level . in section",
    "v , we discuss the analytic approximation of the likelihood functions . by the analytic approximation formulae , we obtain a simple analytic form of @xmath0 , which clearly shows the dependence of @xmath0 on the amplitude of rgws and the noises . by analyzing the analytic form of @xmath0 ,",
    "we find that , in  _ ct _ \" and  _ cte _ \" cases , the main contributions come from the data in the intermedial scale @xmath26 . however , in  _ b _ \" case , the main contribution comes from the data in the very large scale @xmath27 . in section vi , by the simulation method , we find that , the free parameters ( the tensor spectral index @xmath7 , the amplitude of scalar spectrum @xmath5 and the scalar spectral index @xmath6 ) have little influence on the determination of rgws .",
    "section vii is the conclusion that summarizes the main results of this paper .",
    "the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies power spectra are determined by the primordial power spectra of density perturbations ( scalar perturbations ) and rgws ( tensor perturbations ) , and the time evolution of these perturbations during and after the epoch of recombination . before proceeding with the cmb power spectra ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce the primordial perturbation spectra , which are usually assumed to be power - law .",
    "this form is a generic prediction of a wide range of scenarios of the early universe @xcite . in general",
    "there might be deviations from a power - law , parametrized in terms of the running of the spectral index ( see for example @xcite ) , but we shall not consider this probability in the current paper .",
    "thus the primordial power spectra of the perturbation fields have the forms @xmath28 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the scalar and tensor spectral indices , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is pivot wavenumber , which can be arbitrarily chosen . in the wmap paper @xcite ,",
    "the pivot wavenumber @xmath30mpc@xmath31 is used , which is close to the observable horizon .",
    "the scale @xmath32mpc@xmath31 is also commonly used , being the default scale of camb package @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have suggested other pivot wavenumber @xmath29 for different reasons @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ pspt ] ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the amplitudes of the primordial scalar and tensor spectra respectively , at the pivot scale @xmath29 .",
    "we can re - parameterize the tensor power spectrum amplitude @xmath34 by the  tensor - to - scalar ratio \" @xmath20 , which is defined by @xmath35 in addition , the ratio of tensor quadrupole to scalar quadrupole @xmath14 is also quoted when referring to the tensor - to - scalar ratio ( see for instant @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath20 is somewhat cosmology - dependence , especially on the dark energy density @xmath36 .",
    "the conversion is @xmath37 @xcite . for the cosmological models with @xmath38",
    ", these two definitions are simply related by @xmath39 . in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath14 . however , in this paper we shall use @xmath20 , the default quantity used in the camb package @xcite .    using eqs .",
    "( [ pspt ] ) and ( [ define_r ] ) , one can evaluate @xmath20 at a different wavenumber @xmath40 , @xmath41 in the following discussion , we shall discuss the constraint on the parameter @xmath20 by the simulated data . from the relation ( [ k1k0 ] ) we find that , if the spectral indices @xmath7 and @xmath6 are fixed as @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the likelihood analysis ( the case in sections [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] ) , we have @xmath44 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath20 has the exactly same value at all pivot wavenumbers .",
    "so we do not need to differentiate the tensor - to - scalar ratio at the different pivot scales .",
    "however , if the spectral indices are free parameters in the likelihood analysis ( the case in section [ s5 ] ) , comparing with @xmath45 , the constraint of @xmath46 is also influenced by the spectral indices .",
    "so in this case , we should differentiate the tensor - to - scalar ratio at the different pivot wavenumbers .",
    "this effect will be clearly shown in section [ s5 ] .    we should mention that , in the specific early universe models , the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath20 and @xmath7 are always not separate @xcite . however , in this paper we shall avoid any specific model , and consider the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath20 and @xmath7 as the independent parameters in the data analysis .",
    "the cmb radiation field is usually characterized by four stokes parameters ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "@xmath48 is the total intensity of radiation , @xmath49 and @xmath50 describe the magnitude and direction of linear polarization , and @xmath51 is the circular polarization . from these stokes parameters , we can construct four invariant quantities ( @xmath52 ) , which can be expanded over ordinary spherical harmonics ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the set of multipole coefficients @xmath53 completely characterize the intensity and polarization of the radiation field .",
    "since thompson scattering of initial unpolarized light can not generate circular polarization , we shall not consider the @xmath51 stokes parameter in the following discussion .    in general , the output of the cmb experiment @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , consists of two contributions , the signal convolved with the beam window function @xmath56 and the noise @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 we shall use the notations @xmath59 and @xmath60 to denote the signal and noise .",
    "these two contributions are uncorrelated to each other .    assuming the primordial perturbation fields ( including the scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations ) are gaussian fields , which induces that the signal term @xmath61 has the covariance @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is known as the cmb power spectra , which depends on the cosmological inputs . when @xmath64 , @xmath63 is the auto - correlation power spectra , and when @xmath65 , @xmath63 is the cross - correlation power spectra . in absence of any parity - violating processes ,",
    "the only survived cross - correlation power spectra is @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "so the temperature and polarization anisotropies can be described completely by four power spectra : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath66 .",
    "the noise terms @xmath57 and the window function @xmath70 depend on the experiment .",
    "we assume the noise is a spatially uniform gaussian white noise . for an experiment with some known beam width and sensitivity ,",
    "the noise power spectra and window function can be approximated as    @xmath71    @xmath72,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 is the full width at half maximum of the gaussian beam , and @xmath74 is the root mean square of the instrumental noise .",
    "non - diagonal noise terms ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) are expected to vanish since the noises contributions from different maps are uncorrelated .",
    "the assumption of a spatially uniform gaussian noises spectrum ensures that the noise term is diagonal in the @xmath75 basis . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider the planck instrumental noises .",
    "there are several frequency channels for the detection of cmb in planck satellite @xcite . in this paper , in order to estimate the planck noises , we only adopt the frequency channel at 143ghz , which has the low foreground levels and the lowest noises power spectra . in this channel , we have @xcite , @xmath76 inserting these into eq .",
    "( [ noises ] ) , we obtain the noise power spectra @xmath77    considering eqs .",
    "( [ s+n ] ) , ( [ powerspectra ] ) and ( [ noises ] ) , we obtain the covariances of the terms @xmath78 , which are @xmath79      in section [ section2.1 ] , we have introduced the cmb power spectra , which are defined as ensemble averages over all possible realization of the cmb field . however , in cmb observations , we only have access to one single realization of this ensemble . in order to obtain information on the power spectra from a single realization ,",
    "it is desirable to introduce the estimators of the power spectra , which are observable quantities .    in the full sky case , and taking into account the noises , the best unbiased estimators @xmath80 for the cmb power spectra @xmath63 are defined by @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of the degree of freedom for a fix multipole @xmath75 . in the full sky case , we have @xmath83 . the expectation values and",
    "the standard deviations of these estimators are @xcite @xmath84    it is necessary to investigate the pdfs for @xmath80 , which have been derived in @xcite , based on the assumption : the primordial perturbation fields and noise fields are independent gaussian fields . in this subsection",
    ", we shall briefly introduce the results as follows ( the similar results are also obtained in the refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the pdf of the auto - correlation estimator @xmath85 is known as the @xmath86 distribution , which is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the degree of freedom for the multipole @xmath75 in the full sky case .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is defined by @xmath89 .    the joint pdf for the estimators @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the following wishart distribution @xmath93 where the quantities @xmath94 are defined by : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath99 are the standard deviations of the multipole coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "@xmath102 is the correlation coefficient of @xmath100 and @xmath103 , which can be written as , @xmath104    from the wishart distribution ( [ wishart ] ) , we can derive the joint pdf of the estimators @xmath90 and @xmath91 by integrating the variable @xmath92 , the finial result is @xmath105    we can also obtain the joint pdf for all the four estimators : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath106 .",
    "since @xmath9-polarization estimator @xmath106 is independent of the estimators @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the total joint pdf is the product of the wishart distribution @xmath107 in ( [ wishart ] ) and the @xmath86 distribution @xmath108 in ( [ chi2 ] ) with @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath110    we should notice that , the above results are all based on the assumption of full sky coverage . however , real experiments can only see a fraction of sky . even for satellite experiments ,",
    "a map cut must be performed in order to eliminate point sources and galactic plane foreground contaminations . as a result ,",
    "different multipole moments @xmath111 become correlated with each other @xcite .",
    "the exact pdfs of the estimators in this case takes a rather complicated form , depending on the shape of remaining observed portion of sky @xcite .",
    "however , for experiments probing almost the full sky ( e.g. cobe , wmap , or planck ) , correlations are expected only between neighboring multipoles . in order to simplify the problem",
    ", one can take @xmath111 s to be uncorrelated , and introduce a factor @xmath112 , which denotes the observed fraction of sky . as was shown in @xcite , for the estimators with the multipole number @xmath75",
    ", the number of degree of freedom reduces to @xmath113 ( instead of @xmath114 ) .",
    "thus , compared to the full sky , the inclusion of cut sky reduces the degree of freedom in the definition of the estimators @xmath80 . in this work ,",
    "we shall discuss the cmb field with the cut sky factor @xmath115 which is suggested by planck bluebook @xcite .",
    "in all the following discussion , we should remember to replace @xmath82 with the effective degree of freedom @xmath116 , when using the result in ( [ mean  variances ] ) and the pdfs in ( [ chi2 ] ) , ( [ wishart ] ) , ( [ pdf_ct ] ) or ( [ joint ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we shall investigate the detection abilities for the rgws in the following four cases :  _ b _ \" case , ",
    "_ ct _ \" case ,  _ cte _ \" case and  _ cteb _ \" case , which will be introduced separately in this section .",
    "the first case is the well - known",
    " _ bb _ \" method . in this case",
    ", one can detect the signal of rgws only by the observable @xmath106 , which satisfies the @xmath86 distribution in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) .    in order to study the determination of cosmic parameters from the observed data",
    ", we shall consider the likelihood function .",
    "the likelihood is a term , customarily , used to call the probability density function considered a function of an unknown parameter .",
    "up to a constant , independent of its arguments , the likelihood is defined as the pdf of the set of the moments @xmath106 given @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath117 using the pdf in ( [ chi2 ] ) , and considering the effective degree of freedom @xmath118 in the cut sky , the likelihood function in ( [ blikelihood1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the constant for the normalization .",
    "the noise power spectrum @xmath121 for planck mission is given by eq .",
    "( [ noises2 ] ) .    since the @xmath9-polarization can only be generated by the gravitational waves , the observable @xmath9-polarization power spectrum includes a clean information of the gravitational waves .",
    "this is the advantage of  _ bb _ \" method .",
    "however , the amplitude of the @xmath9-polarization is expected to be very small , which makes the detection of @xmath9-polarization quite difficult .",
    "in addition , the signal of rgws in @xmath9-polarization can be contaminated by the @xmath122-@xmath9 mixing due to the partial sky coverage @xcite , beam asymmetry @xcite and cosmic lensing effect @xcite .",
    "these all can degrade the detection ability of the",
    " _ bb _ \" method .",
    "different from the  _ bb _ \" method , in the previous work @xcite , we have detailed discussed the  _ te _ \" method , detecting the signal of rgws by the cmb @xmath3 power spectrum . in this method ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath66 is two order larger than @xmath69 .",
    "another advantage of this method is that , the @xmath122-@xmath9 mixing , which can occur for some reasons , nearly can not influence @xmath3 power spectrum .",
    "so it can not degrade of the detection ability of this method .",
    "however , in the previous work @xcite , we find that , the uncertainty of the @xmath3 estimator @xmath90 is very large , due to the cosmic uncertainty .",
    "so comparing with  _",
    "bb _ \" method ,  _ te _ \" method has not only the larger signal , but also the larger uncertainty .    in this paper , we shall develop the ",
    "_ te _ \" method by combining the cmb @xmath3 and @xmath2 power spectra . in the real observations ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath67 is much larger than that of the other three power spectra . so combining the @xmath3 and @xmath2 power spectra",
    "are expected to be a more effective way to detect rgws .",
    "we denote it as  _ ct _ \" case . in this case , the likelihood function is @xmath123 using the pdf in ( [ pdf_ct ] ) , this likelihood function can be rewritten as @xmath124      in this case , in addition to the @xmath3 and @xmath2 power spectra , we shall include the @xmath122-polarization power spectrum @xmath68 . by comparing with  _ ct _ \" case , we can investigate the contribution of @xmath122-polarization for the detection of rgws . in this case , the likelihood function is @xmath125 using the pdf in ( [ wishart ] ) , this likelihood can be written as @xmath126      this case will use all the cmb power spectra , @xmath127 and @xmath69 , so it is a combination of  _ cte _ \" and  _ b _ \" . by investigating this case , we can determine the best constraint of rgws by the cmb observation .",
    "in this case , the likelihood is @xmath128 which is the product of @xmath129 and @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131",
    "as the previous work @xcite , in this section , we shall use the maximum likelihood analysis , based on the simulated data , to discuss the sensitivities for the detection of rgws in these four cases .    before proceeding on the simulation method , we shall firstly introduce the background cosmological model . throughout this paper",

    "the extent of the constraints on the cosmological parameters ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) remains an open question in this paper .",
    "actually , by the forthcoming observation of planck satellite , the constraints on these cosmological parameters are expected to be very tight .",
    "for example , the constraint on @xmath138 would be @xmath139 , the constraint on @xmath137 would be @xmath140 @xcite , which are expected to have little influence on the determination of rgws . in all this paper , we take specific values for cosmological parameters as in ( [ background ] ) and assume that they are perfectly known .      in this section , we shall use the maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the constraint on the cosmological parameters .",
    "this method has been used in the previous work @xcite for the cmb analysis and in the work @xcite for dark energy analysis .",
    "if we consider the  _ b _ \" case , the steps of the method can be listed as the follows ( the similar steps can also be used in the  _ ct _ \" , ",
