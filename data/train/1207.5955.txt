    "note that in all the six cases in figure [ fig - rsh1d ] , the bounce shock stalls and then transits to a passive shock which presents negative radial velocity behind the shock . and only after that , the additional energy gain due to nuclear burning acts to bifurcate the path of the passive shock , namely whether the shock experiences recession afterward ( for all the blue lines in figure [ fig - rsh1d ] ) or expansion ( for red lines ) with different revival timescales depending on the input neutrino parameters .",

    "in this case , the silicon layer is shown to be burned as a heating source ( top left panel of figure [ snap1dm15_2050 ] ) , which is the reason that the shock position becomes larger compared to the non - burning model ( figure [ mshell - m15 - 2050 ] ) .",
    "when the shock front begins to swallow the oxygen layer at @xmath80 ms postbounce ( the right panel of figure [ mshell - m15 - 2050 ] ) , the fresh fuel supplies energy to assist the shock expansion ( see , from top right , bottom left , to bottom right panels of figure [ snap1dm15_2050 ] ) . if not for the energy gain , the stalled shock does not revive earlier than @xmath81 ms as seen from the left panel of figure [ mshell - m15 - 2050 ] .",

    "in fact , the diagnostic energy is shown to be remarkably enhanced in the case of marginal explosions ( i.e. , low neutrino luminosity @xmath102 and/or short decay time @xmath40 ) , and the difference gets small for large @xmath102 and @xmath40 , in which explosions are predominantly triggered by neutrino heating . as repeatedly mentioned so far , these features due to nuclear burning are only remarkable in the lc15 progenitor .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that the shock extent even for the ww95 progenitor , for which the impact of nuclear burning is relatively small ( see the bottom left panel of figure [ fig - para1d ] ) , becomes bigger for models with nuclear burning compared to those without ( figure [ rsh1d_w15 ] ) .          ) .",
    "entropy in unit of @xmath103 baryon@xmath64 is in the left - half sphere and silicon mass fraction in the right - half .",
    "shown is the case of ( @xmath104 at @xmath39 = 100 ( _ left panel _ ) and 200 ms ( _ right _ ) postbounce , respectively . ]     but of a 2d model with @xmath105 . ]    ) with @xmath106 .",
    "the diagnostic energy of the case without nuclear burning ( _ blue _ ) is also shown . ]",
    "we move on to discuss axi - symmetric 2d models and examine the effects of nuclear burning in the same manner as in the previous section . to see clearly the impacts of nuclear burning in our 2d simulations , we choose to employ the lc15 in the following .",
    "figures [ fig - snap2d-1 ] and [ fig - snap2d-2 ] show entropy evolution ( left - hand - side in each panel ) with the mass fraction of silicon ( right - hand - side ) for two sets of neutrino parameters at selected postbounce epochs ( @xmath107100 and 200 ms postbounce ) .",
    "small- and large - scale inhomogeneities in the entropy plots come from neutrino - driven convection and the sasi , both of which lead to more easier explosions in 2d than 1d ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    reflecting the stochastic motions of the expanding shocks , the way how the ( anisotropic ) shock surfaces touch the nuclear fuel ( in the shape of spherical shells ) changes from model to model in 2d .",
    "in the case with @xmath108 ( figure [ fig - snap2d-1 ] ) , the expanding shock firstly reaches to the silicon layer near in the vicinity of the north pole at @xmath109 ms .",
    "simultaneously , heavy elements like nickel are synthesized there , which helps to push the burning material preferentially along the direction for the moment . in a less luminous case assuming smaller luminosity ( @xmath110 ) , and the same decay time ( figure [ fig - snap2d-2 ] ) , the shock encounters the silicon layer closer to the center , where a mass accretion rate is effectively higher , resulting in the longer explosion time .",
    "as shown from figure [ fig - eex2d ] , nuclear burning does assist 2d explosions similar to 1d , but the energy difference ( here @xmath111 erg ) is generally smaller in 2d than in 1d ( compare with figures [ eex1d_m15_2220 ] , and [ eex1d_m15_2250 ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the energy gain due to nuclear burning between 1d and 2d models is more clearly shown in table [ tbl - result ] and figure [ fig - eddif2d ] .",
    "the difference of the diagnostic energy with and without nuclear burning is larger in 1d than that in 2d .",
    "this may be because neutrino - driven convection and the sasi in 2d models ( as indicated by entropy distributions in figures [ fig - snap2d-1 ] and [ fig - snap2d-2 ] ) enhances the neutrino heating efficiency , which makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compare to 1d models .",
    "finally figure [ fig - para2d ] is the parameter map in 2d for the lc15 progenitor .",
    "as expected , 2d hydrodynamics leads to more easier explosions compared to 1d ( see the dashed lines which are the critical curves in 1d ) .",
    "more importantly , the yellow region still exists in 2d models for the lc15 progenitor . nuclear energy released in 2d models reduces the critical luminosity by @xmath112 depending on @xmath99 , as well as 1d models , although its impact on the diagnostic energy is weaker than for 1d models . it would be interesting to perform multi - d ( radiation - hydro ) simulations with nuclear network calculation for the previously untested progenitor model .",
    "but for lc15 model in 2d ( @xmath44 ) . ]",
    "but for 2d simulations .",
    "the dashed lines represent the critical curves in 1d ( compare figure [ fig - para1d ] ) .",
    "note that we adopt coarse mesh points in the polar direction ( 32 uniform grids ) , so that we can perform 2d simulations for 174 models in total to make this parameter map . ]",
    "we revisited the potential impacts of nuclear burning on the onset of neutrino - driven explosions of core - collapse supernovae . by changing the neutrino luminosity and its decay time to obtain parametric explosions in 1d and 2d models with or without a 13-isotope @xmath0 network , we studied how the inclusion of nuclear burning could affect the postbounce dynamics for four progenitor models ; three for @xmath113 stars of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and one for an @xmath2 star of @xcite our results showed that the energy gain due to nuclear burning of infalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially for models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear burning .",
    "these models enjoy the assistance from nuclear burning typically in the following two ways , whether the shock front passes through the silicon - rich layer , or later it touches to the oxygen - rich layer . depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time , the diagnostic energy of explosion was found to increase up to a few times @xmath3 erg for models with nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without .",
    "the energy difference becomes generally smaller in 2d than in 1d , because neutrino - driven convection and the sasi in 2d models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency , making the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to 1d models .",
    "it was pointed out that these features are most remarkable for the lc15 progenitor , which possesses a massive oxygen layer with its inner - edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors , which makes the timescale shorter for the shock to encounter the rich fuel . considering reduction of the critical luminosity and increase of the diagnostic energy by nuclear burning , and also uncertainties in the structure of progenitors ,",
    "our results indicate that nuclear burning should still remain as one of the important ingredients to foster the onset of neutrino - driven explosions .",

    "in this paper , we use a reaction network involving 13 @xmath0 nuclei for the purpose to investigate a potential role of nuclear burning in reviving and strengthening weak shocks in neutrino - driven explosions .",
    "although the 13-@xmath0 network calculation itself is rather simple , it is computationally expensive to perform them for each species evolved with multi - d hydrodynamics . to avoid this expense ,",
    "various simplifications are employed , for example , a `` flashing method '' @xcite . in the flashing method , a hydrodynamic flow is characterized by its matter density @xmath13 and temperature @xmath33 .",
    "the flow travels in a @xmath13-@xmath33 plane and changes its chemical composition and releases nuclear energy according to the region where it is in the plane .",
    "figure [ fig - dpplane ] presents the composition of flows in the @xmath13-@xmath33 plane , which is slightly different from the original one @xcite .",
    "we compare the evolution of composition and subsequent energy release of flows in this ",
    "pseudo- \" flashing method with those in our @xmath0 network .",
    "plane characterizing our pseud - flusing method .",
    "region i almost consists of nickel , region ii contains @xmath0-particles and free nucleons , and in region iii all nuclei and @xmath0-particles are dissolved into free nucleons . in region",
    "iv we resolve the nuclear network to evolve the chemical compositions .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "we take 3 flows ( a , b , and c ) as representations of mass shells in lc 15 model . ]",
    "following to @xcite we assume that dissociation of nuclei and the recombination of free nucleons and @xmath0-particles change the chemical composition below the transition density ( @xmath117 ) . in region",
    "i all free nucleons and @xmath0 particles form @xmath22ni . in region",
    "ii all heavy nuclei are dissolved and free nucleons recombine into @xmath0 particles . in region iii all heavy nuclei and @xmath0 particles are disintegrated into free nucleons .",
    "these three regions are separated by two curves @xmath118 in the @xmath119 plane : @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the temperature in unit of @xmath123 k. above the transition density ( region iv ) we calculate the nuclear network instead of the use of the equation of state of @xcite as in @xcite .",
    "three horizontal lines at @xmath124 and @xmath125 present @xmath126c burning to @xmath127 mg , @xmath128o-@xmath129ne-@xmath127 mg burning to @xmath130si , and @xmath130si burning to @xmath22ni , respectively . at @xmath131",
    "we assume that all nuclei are disintegrated into free nucleon independent of density .    here",
    "we take three flows in lc 15 model named a , b , and c , located in the mass coordinate at @xmath132 ( fe core ) , @xmath133 ( si layer ) , and @xmath134 ( o / si layer ) , respectively .",
    "these flows are launched via 1-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation by putting thermal energy in the innermost region of the iron core so that the explosion energy of @xmath116 erg is obtained .",
    "each flow undergoes shock heating and compression ( to the upper right direction in figure [ fig - dpplane ] ) , then expands and gets cool ( to the lower left ) .",
    "we compare the change of chemical compositions ( figure [ fig - abund ] ) and released energy ( figure [ fig - energy ] ) via the flashing method with those estimated by @xmath0 network .",
    "both of the methods show similar energy yield for all flows at late phase , although the intermediate evolution and final abundance of intermediate - mass elements are different .",
    "this difference is caused by our treatment that the composition immediately changes when a flow goes across a line separating regions presented in figure [ fig - dpplane ] . to avoid the unrealistic jump , @xcite introduced factors @xmath135 , and @xmath136 so that the composition change progresses gradually .",
    "we conclude that the flashing method is a good approximation and useful for sn simulations .",
    "our current study is based on the light - bulb ( lb ) scheme , in which a prescribed neutrino heating and cooling rate is used .",
    "this simple approach reduces computational cost compared with more sophisticated simulations and makes our extensive parameter study possible .",
    "the light - bulb approximation has been frequently used for various purposes , such as to study effects of spacial dimensionality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and progenitor inhomogeneities @xcite on the neutrino - driven mechanism , explosive nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gravitational - wave signals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so on .",
    "the light - bulb method is also useful for removing feedbacks from physical inputs into the neutrino luminosity and temperature , which enables to investigate the relative changes due to different choice of the physical inputs ( e.g. , eos study by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this appendix",
    ", we briefly discuss the validity of the lb scheme by comparing the neutrino luminosities , average energy , and heating rates assumed in this study with those from 1d simulations in which spectral neutrino transport is solved by the isotropic diffusion source approximation ( idsa ) scheme ( see , @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "we employ the lc15 progenitor model in both of the two runs .",
    "figure [ idsa - ln ] shows the time evolution of neutrino luminosities estimated from idsa simulations . in the previous studies using the light - bulb models ,",
    "the neutrino luminosities are assumed to be constant , although it is apparently unrealistic . in this paper",
    ", we introduced another parameter , the decay time of neutrino luminosities , to complement this discrepancy .",
    "the neutrino luminosities are not a monotonic function of time and only a late phase can be fit by an exponential decay with @xmath137 s. the evolution of average energy of neutrinos is shown in figure [ idsa - en ] .",
    "according to the previous studies , we assume the electron neutrino temperature to be kept constant as @xmath31 mev . figure [ idsa - en ] presents an almost constant energy of neutrinos with @xmath138mev , indicating that the constant neutrino temperature is not a bad assumption .",
    "finally we compare the neutrino heating rate from the idsa simulations with that from the light - bulb scheme ( figure 24 ) . taking the neutrino luminosity , electron and neutron fractions , and temperature distributions from the idsa simulation , we put them into eqs .",
    "( [ eq - heating ] ) and ( [ eq - cooling ] ) to estimate the heating rate by the light - bulb scheme . here",
    "the neutrino temperature is fixed to be @xmath31 mev .",
    "note that we drop an suppression term @xmath139 for the current estimation .",
    "the light - bulb model captures well the heating and cooling regions , although the heating rate behind the shock is underestimated compared to that from idsa .",
    "nevertheless , it is still a powerful tool for a parametric search to explore qualitative trends , such as effects of neutrino luminosity , its decay timescale , and nuclear burning on boosting the onset of neutrino - driven explosions ."

    "<S> we point out that these features are most remarkable for the limongi - chieffi progenitor in both 1d and 2d , because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer with its inner - edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors , so that the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference is generally smaller ( @xmath4 erg ) in 2d than in 1d ( at most @xmath5 erg ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because neutrino - driven convection and the shock instability in 2d models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency , which makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to 1d models . </S>",
