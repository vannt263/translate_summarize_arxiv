    "with the discovery of distant submm and mm galaxies in blank field surveys and cluster lens assisted surveys ( see * ? ? ? * for a review and references ) , it was immediately recognized that this population holds important clues for the understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "a significant part of the cosmic submm background is produced by these objects that must be extremely luminous ( l@xmath5l@xmath6 ) distant ( z@xmath31 ) infrared galaxies powered by intense star formation and/or powerful agn .",
    "x - ray data argue in most cases against ( compton - thin ) agn and in favor of intense star formation dominating their luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these high star formation rates ( @xmath7100 - 1000m@xmath6/yr ) and the similarity of co - moving space densities of submm sources and local ellipticals suggest that they are likely indicating the formation of massive spheroids .",
    "this opens a direct route to locating the formation of spheroids between the two extremes of an early formation similar to the classical ` monolithic collapse ' , and a late formation in hierarchical merging .",
    "more specifically , properties and mass functions for these high redshift objects are robust tests for current hierarchical models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "indeed there is evidence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that these models need some modification to reproduce the space densities of the massive high redshift submm galaxies and their quiescent phases that must exist since their star formation rates and gas content suggest a duty cycle of the bright ( sub)mm phase well below one .",
    "much of this promise will only fully come to fruition after a difficult process of identification and spectroscopic redshift determination . based on optical spectroscopy , significant progress in the identification work",
    "was done by @xcite who presented 10 redshifts of radio identified counterparts of scuba galaxies . but still , less than a dozen optical / near - infrared redshifts for suggested counterparts have been confirmed by co observations as the true redshift of the submm source ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and very few mm - selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "these accurate positions are indispensable for reliable optical / near - infrared identifications since several possible optical / near - infrared counterparts are usually found in the several arc second radius error circles of the ( sub)mm surveys .",
    "this identification step is the subject of the present work .",
    "of the two interferometric identification methods in use for ( sub)mm sources , mm interferometry has the advantage of directly and unambiguously locating the dust emission , but it is very time consuming with current instruments , with tens of hours typically needed for a single object in the small field of view .",
    "because of the tight radio / far - infrared relation for star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radio interferometry is the next best option , with the advantage of the large vla primary beam covering one of the currently typical ( sub)mm survey fields entirely . of the brighter ( sub)mm sources from present surveys , deep 1.4ghz vla maps",
    "will detect all but the highest redshift ones @xcite , and the risk of false associations of ( sub)mm and radio sources is modest for the 1.4ghz source counts at the relevant flux levels of tens of @xmath2jy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we are building on our mm survey ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) that uses the mambo array @xcite at the iram 30 m telescope to cover three fields , the lockman hole , abell 2125 , and a region centered on , but larger than the ntt deep field ( ndf , * ? ? ?",
    "this paper focuses on the ndf region .",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) have presented results for three of the brightest ndf mm sources using the iram plateau de bure mm interferometer ( pdbi ) and bvrik imaging .",
    "we now increase to 18 the number of ndf mm sources with accurate positions by using our vla interferometry , and introduce additional z- and j - band optical / near - infrared imaging obtained since publishing paper  i. we thus identify counterparts and start assembling optical to radio spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the objects constraining their nature and redshift .",
    "the improved statistics is the basis for a discussion of the properties of mm galaxies and their relation to , or differences from , the submm population . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath8=70kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10=0.3 , @xmath11=0.7 .",
    "the radio data play a key role in the identification presented in this paper .",
    "the ntt deep field was observed at 1.4 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) in april and may , 2001 , for 15 hours in the b configuration ( 10 km maximum baseline ) .",
    "standard wide field imaging mode was employed ( 50 mhz total bandwidth with two polarizations and 16 spectral channels ) .",
    "the source 3c 286 was used for absolute gain calibration and 1224 + 035 was used for phase and bandpass calibration .",
    "the data were also self - calibrated using sources in the ntt deep field itself .",
    "images were synthesized and deconvolved using the wide field imaging capabilities in the aips task imagr , and the primary beam correction was applied to the final image .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the gaussian clean beam was @xmath12 with a pa @xmath13 .",
    "the rms noise on the final image is between 13 and 15 @xmath2jy over the 15@xmath1415  region covered by mambo .",
    "the variation of the rms noise of the map was not only caused by the usual beam attenuation and uv plane coverage , but was also due to residual calibration errors because of a relatively large number of bright sources ( 2 sources of @xmath3 60 mjy / beam ) and one spatial grouping of fainter but still relatively bright sources to the northeast of the center of the map .",
    "these residual calibration errors manifested themselves as uneven noise in a series of stripes in the final map .",
    "about 1/3 of area of the final vla map was affected by this striping .",
    "we describe in   [ sect : assoc ] how this was dealt with in identifying radio counterparts to the mambo 1.2 mm detections .",
    "we use the bvrik imaging of a field centered on the ndf that is described in paper  i. we have obtained additional z and j - band imaging in spring 2003 .",
    "the z - band observations were carried out in ` service mode ' on the nights of april 6 and 7 , 2003 using the imaging spectrograph fors2 on ut4 of the vlt .",
    "the data were taken as a sequence of dithered exposures with a net integration time of 1 hour each covering 4 separate pointings .",
    "the pointings were chosen such that a mosaic of the images taken at the 4 pointings covers the whole of the k - band field centered on the ndf .",
    "the images were processed in the standard way but were flat - fielded using images generated by masking out all objects with surface brightnesses outside 1 sigma of the background noise and then combined by taking the pixel median of all the frames without the images being aligned .",
    "this flat - field frame was then normalized to one and then divided into each z - band image .",
    "conditions were photometric throughout the observations and the seeing was typically about 0.5 arc seconds .",
    "the final calibration was determined through observations of the spectrophotometric standard ltt7987",
    "@xcite for the z - band filter .",
    "however , given the very sensitive red response of the fors2 array , the z - band filter was calibrated by integrating the spectral energy distribution of ltt7987 @xcite and of bd+17 4708 @xcite which is the absolute flux calibrator for the gunn - z filter @xcite . in making these estimates ,",
    "both the response of the ccd and the filter transmission ( both of which are available on the eso web pages ) were considered .",
    "the average noise across the frame is such that the 3@xmath15 detection limits in a 2  diameter aperture is z@xmath16=26.38 .",
    "the absolute flux distribution of ltt7987 provides a direct calibration of the images in the ab - magnitude system which yields z@xmath17=z@xmath16 - 0.30 .",
    "j - band imaging was obtained with sofi at the eso ntt between march 14 and 16 2003 , covering the same @xmath18 region as our k@xmath4 image of the ndf to a 3@xmath15 limiting magnitude for a 2  aperture of 24.0 in j on the vega system .",
    "data reduction followed similar steps as described in paper  i , with the photometric zero point in j based on 2mass .",
    "we used common sources to bring these new data to the same astrometric system as described in paper  i , including the small correction described in paper  i from the usno - a1 based optical / near - infrared astrometry of our optical / near - infrared data to the radio reference frame .",
    "all positions quoted here include this correction and are on the radio frame .      in order to obtain more accurate positions for the mambo sources through use of their radio continuum emission",
    ", we have searched the 1.4ghz vla data for peaks of at least 40@xmath2jy ( @xmath19 ) in the region where the mambo sources are located , out to radii of about 10  from the phase center .",
    "table  [ tab : assoc ] lists the mambo sources in the catalog as of early 2002 which have radio sources with peak positions less than 7  from the nominal mambo map position .",
    "this radius is more than half the fwhm of the mambo beam and will not exclude real associations even in case of slight systematic offsets .",
    "the table , like all our subsequent analysis , does not include the well - detected quasar br1202 - 0725 which was driving the original selection of the public eso ndf , and thus can not be considered an unbiased representative of the mm galaxy population . a more complete description of the mambo data analysis will be given in bertoldi et al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation ) . at @xmath20 resolution",
    ", our b configuration data do not put interesting constraints on the extent of the radio emission of the detected galaxies .",
    "table  [ tab : assoc ] also lists the corrected poissonian probability that an association is a chance coincidence , derived using the approach of @xcite which corrects the simple poissonian probability of an observed association for the possibility of associations of different nature but similar probability . in deriving these probabilities",
    "we adopt the raw counts of @xmath2140@xmath2jy peaks in the region of our vla image covered by the mambo data , which are significantly above the true 1.4ghz source counts for a flux close to the detection limit . using true radio source counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would thus have underestimated the chance of a false association .",
    "the probabilities listed together with the fact that 42 sources from the original mambo list were searched for nearby radio peaks suggest that several of the associations may be chance .",
    "this statistical analysis , however , does not adequately consider that the excess of @xmath140@xmath2jy peaks boosting the rate of chance coincidences is largely due to peaks in the vla map that cluster in certain regions , due to uneven noise and striping because of residual calibration errors .",
    "considering this enables us to identify those associations that are more likely to be spurious by inspection of the distribution of @xmath2140@xmath2jy peaks in the radio map .",
    "the quality of an associated radio source is indicated in table  [ tab : assoc ] , with ` uncertain ' assigned to sources with an excess of similar brightness peaks near to the suggested radio source , and in particular with alignments of peaks due to striping .",
    "we also consider as uncertain radio peaks that do not remain above 40@xmath2jy in a radio image where larger scale variations are partially removed by subtracting a 20  median smoothed version of the radio image , and two faint radio peaks near sources no .",
    "10 and 25 that are only above 40@xmath2jy in this image to which we refer as the background - subtracted image below . of the identifications we consider ` good ' below , all but source 13 are either above 4@xmath15 in the original radio map , or confirmed by pdbi mm interferometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : assoc ] displays the mm  radio offsets corresponding to the associations listed in table  [ tab : assoc ] .",
    "the dominance of real associations is clear .",
    "there were no indications for systematic offsets .",
    "the separations found are consistent with a typical mambo position error of about 3 , and confirm the radius of 7  as a sensible choice for searching for associated radio sources .",
    "overall , interferometric positions are available for 18 out of 42 sources in the ndf mambo map .",
    "we consider 11 of these 18 reliable , either through ` good ' radio peaks or through direct pdbi mm interferometry ( paper  i ) .",
    "interestingly , the pdbi data confirm the reality of two of the more uncertain radio sources , increasing confidence in the rest of these objects .",
    "the remaining mambo sources without radio associations could be at high redshift ( with corresponding radio fluxes below our detection limit ) , could be spurious mm sources or have mambo fluxes systematically overestimated because of the bias induced by noise in a population with steep number counts . given the signal - to - noise ratios of the mambo detections all these explanations may contribute . for the purpose of this identification paper",
    ", we do not discuss further objects without an interferometric position .",
    "this induces a bias towards lower redshift and brighter objects .",
    "images of @xmath22 size in brzk for the mambo sources with interferometric position are shown in figure  [ fig : idplot1 ] .",
    "table  [ tab : idtable ] lists the positions and bvrizjk photometric data of optical / near - infrared objects that are close to the interferometric positions .",
    "the photometry is in 2  diameter apertures centered on the positions which are derived from a first step sextractor @xcite analysis of a noise - scaled co - addition of the bvrizjk images .",

    "for the measurements in the individual bands , we indicate in table  [ tab : idtable ] cases where we consider the sextractor aperture magnitudes more uncertain , since the object is only tentatively ( indicated by ` @xmath7 ' ) or not ( indicated by ` !

    ", we designate the optical / near - infrared objects with a combination of the short mambo number ( table  [ tab : assoc ] ) and a letter increasing with distance from the interferometric position .",
    "these letters are also indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : idplot1 ] .",
    "the short mambo numbers used in this paper are consistent with the ntt - mmnn numbers used by @xcite in their comparison of 850@xmath2 m and 1.2 mm fluxes of mambo sources .",

    "we have used the publicly available _ hyperz _ photometric redshift code @xcite to estimate redshifts from our seven band photometry .",
    "we have verified the _ hyperz _ results for our specific photometric dataset by comparison of photometric redshifts to spectroscopic redshifts for 63 objects between z@xmath23=0.07 and 1.69 in the ntt deep field and its surroundings , for which spectroscopic redshifts are available from our own projects in that region and from eso science verification data ( http://www.eso.org/science/ut2sv/ndfs_release.html ) .",
    "the dispersion @xmath15@xmath24 of 0.17 is satisfactory , with few gross outliers .",
    "no trend between the accuracy of our photometric redshift and the color ( r - k ) is seen .",
    "we note however that _ hyperz _ does not contain an observed sed of a ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ; which the sed of a mm sources may be similar ) , although it does allow for a range of additional extinction to be added to the model which may approximate a sed similar to that seen in ulirgs .",
    "we notice a systematic effect at z@xmath251 , in the sense that photometric redshifts tend to be overestimated for sources with z@xmath250.3 and underestimated in objects with 0.7@xmath25z@xmath251.0 .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in subaru deep field photometric redshifts obtained with _ hyperz _",
    "* their fig .  1 ) .",
    "these systematic effects as well as the dispersion of z@xmath23-z@xmath26 suggest that for individual bright objects the 1@xmath15 errors from _ hyperz _ in table  [ tab : idtable ] underestimate the real errors , but at a level where the photometric redshifts are still valuable constraints for the suggested counterparts and for nearby objects .",
    "this section gives a case - by - case discussion of the individual interferometrically located mambo sources and identifies the suggested optical / near - infrared counterparts .",
    "we consider as possible counterparts optical / nir objects that are less than 2 times the interferometric positional error ( table  [ tab : assoc ] ) away from the interferometric position .",
    "again , we have derived the corrected poissonian probabilities for a chance coincidence computed according to @xcite and considering the search radius of twice the radio positional error .",
    "table  [ tab : idtable ] lists these probabilities for the objects inside the 2@xmath15 search circle , adopting the k - band number counts of @xcite .",
    "deriving probabilities this way ignores color information and thus implicitly assumes a similar color distribution of counterparts and field population . in reality",
    "the colors differ (   [ sect : optnir ] ) , i.e. we are overestimating the probability of a particular object being a random coinciding member of the field population .    for convenience , salient properties of the counterparts",

    "redshifts from the radio / submm spectral index are based on the flux densities from table  [ tab : assoc ] and the relation of @xcite .",
    "these redshifts are subject to the applicability of the far - infrared seds used to calibrate this relation , and may be overestimated if cool luminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) are prominent in the ( sub)mm population .",
    "the possibility of cool galaxies is also intimately related to the role of lensing in the identification of optical / near - infrared counterparts of submm sources @xcite  as long as the redshift of the dust source is not confirmed through co lines , certain configurations could correspond either to a ` cool ' low z dust source or a ` warm ' high z dust source with a superposed lensing foreground object . therefore , for several objects , we present arguments on the potential role of lensing by individual foreground galaxies .",

    "some estimate of the magnitude of the effect can be gained from comparison to the local ulirg population .",
    "half light radii have been estimated at several wavelengths , with median results of the order 5.3 kpc in u @xcite , 3 kpc in i @xcite and about 1.5 kpc in h and k @xcite . at redshifts around 3 an aperture of 2",
    "diameter spans about 15 kpc .",
    "half light radii of @xmath14 kpc in the rest frame v band ( observed k band ) would then mean no significant loss of light outside our aperture .",
    "this is only true as long as the structural analogy to local ulirgs holds , of course , and a major fraction of light could be lost for objects more than a factor of 2 larger , especially if at z@xmath34 .",
    "such large objects would be placed too low in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdiag ] by our measurements .",
    "this implies that the displacement of many scuba and mambo objects down - wards from the location of local ulirgs could include an effect of large spatial extent as well as obscuration of the rest frame optical part of the sed .",
    "testing such a scenario would require extremely deep k imaging .",
    "size constraints at other wavelengths ( optical , mm , radio ) will be useful as well , but for this question they will have to be interpreted with some caution considering the strong trends for local infrared galaxies , where half light radii decrease as wavelength increases .",
    "the difference in brightness of about two magnitudes between typical mambo and scuba counterparts is a surprising result , given the selection of these objects at fairly similar wavelengths and on a part of the rest frame spectral energy distribution that does not show prominent breaks or features .",
    "we discuss in the following several potential contributors to this difference .    given the faintness of the targets in comparison to instrumental sensitivities at _ all _ wavelengths , the identification process may still contain errors . for the ndf mambo sources , some of the near 3@xmath15 radio sources are clearly uncertain and may lead to uncertain identifications .",
    "we have argued above , however , that eliminating the uncertain sources as classified in   [ sect : assoc ] does not change the magnitude distribution of the mambo counterparts significantly .",
    "for the scuba sources similar problems may be present at the limit of the radio data .",
    "in addition , there are by now examples where intensified identification efforts have rejected previously adopted bright counterparts and lead to a significant upward revision of the proposed counterpart magnitudes , the most notable being hdf850.1 @xcite , smmj00266 + 1708 @xcite and smmj09431 + 4700 @xcite . taking away a few of the brightest or bluest 8mjy counterparts from fig .",
    "[ fig : magdist ] does not fully remove the difference to the mambo counterparts , though .",
    "noting all these uncertainties we do not see any compelling evidence for systematic mis - identifications .",
    "identification uncertainties are also related to the presence of ` complex ' objects with several components , e.g. , one of the mm galaxies discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite emphasize the role of such objects in the 8mjy survey .",
    "again , the example of smmj09431 + 4700 @xcite where the submm and co source h7 is 4  from the object h6 with a very similar ( optical ) redshift indicates that such grouping or clustering exists . in such cases",
    ", the ( sub)mm source could relate to just one or to all of the components .",
    "we find only three such objects in our sample .",
    "10 we have preferred one component because of photometric redshift arguments . for objects 29 and 42 there is more uncertainty on whether to identify the source with one or several components , but even the sum of the components will not be a ` bright ' counterpart .",
    "optical / near - infrared magnitude differences could also reflect a significant difference in the redshift distribution of the two populations .",
    "the effect in the optical / near - infrared will obviously depend on the intrinsic seds , for ulirg - like sed shapes and keeping the ( sub)mm flux fixed a difference in median redshifts of the order @xmath50z=1 - 2 may be necessary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ik ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggest a median redshift of 2.4 for bright submm galaxies from optical spectroscopy .",
    "some of these optical redshifts still require confirmation by co detections , and it is natural to assume that the optical redshifts are still biased towards the optically bright and low redshift end of the population .",
    "this assumption is supported by sed arguments (   [ sect : optradsed ] ) .",
    "even at redshifts around or somewhat above 3 , however , both scuba and mambo observations effectively sample the long wavelength side of the rest frame far - infared sed peak , unless the intrinsic dust temperatures were extremely cold .",
    "evidence for both wavelengths sampling the long wavelength side is indeed present in many of the best studied scuba sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at such redshifts",
    ", it will be difficult to construct a redshift distribution that fully accounts for the observed differences .",
    "redshift estimates for the scuba population from the radio / submm spectral index @xcite , and from estimates trying to more fully include the rest - frame far - infrared part of the sed under the assumption of seds similar to local ulirgs @xcite indicate median redshifts in the range 2.5 to 3.5 with the possibility of a significant high redshift tail @xcite . however , it is important to note that such analysis suffer from possible template mismatches between high and low redshift sources and using an unrealistically narrow range of sed types and properties when making redshift estimates .",
    "for example , @xcite may perhaps put undue weight on single templates by matching one template to each source to constrain the possible redshift range .",
    "this means that low redshift seds they have in their analysis must be good analogues for high redshift sources .",
    "in addition , a substantial number of higher redshift z@xmath04 sources in the mambo population is also suggested by the 850@xmath2m/1.2 mm ratios presented by @xcite , albeit with large uncertainties due to the technical difficulties of the method . for the objects overlapping with our study ( nos . 1 , 3 , 16 , 25 , 31 ) their 850@xmath2m/1.2 mm redshift estimates can be compared to the detection in various optical pass - bands",
    "- if they are at high redshift , these objects should be undetected dropouts in optical bands . with the possible exception of no.3 ( best submm / mm estimate z@xmath14.25 but a marginal detection in b )",
    "the results are consistent , and even for this object considering the uncertainties . in summary , while there may be a high redshift tail of the ( sub)mm population preferentially sampled by mambo , we find it difficult to explain the magnitude differences by a bulk redshift difference .",
    "this view is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdiag ] which does not only show the ` diagonal ' offset between the two sets expected in such a case .",
    "because of the degeneracy of redshift and dust temperature in interpretations of the submm / radio spectral energy distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar arguments can be made with respect to a possible separation of the mambo and scuba populations by dust temperature , for example due to an evolutionary difference between mambo and scuba objects .",
    "one should note , however , the need for significant obscuration in the rest frame optical when invoking ` cool ' rest - frame fir seds ( e.g. , paper i ) .",
    "the results shown here indicate that there are real differences in the counterpart brightnesses and perhaps redshifts of the scuba and mambo populations . on the sole basis of the sed arguments presented it is difficult to robustly weight the contributions of real differences in redshifts and spectral energy distributions of the mm and submm selected populations to this difference , in comparison to caveats due to small sample statistics , cosmic variance , and identification difficulties .",
    "significant progress in settling these issues will come from tests of proposed identifications with available optical redshifts through co measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and from future direct submm / mm redshift measurements for the fainter part of the population , most likely through wide band searches for co emission .",
    "we have discussed optical / near - infrared identifications for those 18 of 42 sources in our mambo 1.2 mm map of the ntt deep field region for which interferometric positions are available through a vla 1.4ghz map and in three cases iram pdbi mm interferometry .",
    "in addition to being the basis for identifications , our deep bvrizjk imaging allows the derivation of optical / near - infrared photometric redshifts for the counterparts and for nearby objects . in comparison with radio / submm redshift estimates",
    ", these photometric redshifts suggest that two of the optical / near - infrared sources close to interferometric positions are in the foreground , in one case likely lensing the background mm source .",
    "one strongly lensed object in this sample is consistent with expectations for the ( sub)mm population @xcite .",
    "this leaves us with eleven detections of counterparts at magnitudes of k=19 to 22.5 , and seven limits or blank fields with most limits at k@xmath022 .",
    "the i - k and j - k colors of the counterparts are consistent with redshifted seds similar to local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , and likely with a similarly large spread of the rest frame uv / optical sed properties .",
    "the counterparts of mm sources contribute to the recently discussed population of j - k@xmath02.3 , k@xmath3922.5 high redshift galaxies , but only at the few percent level for the current mm survey depths .",
    "at least @xmath120% of the mambo sources with radio counterparts have j - k@xmath02.3 and k@xmath3922.5 .",
    "the counterparts to ndf mm sources are on average about 2 magnitudes fainter than counterparts presented for the 8mjy 850@xmath2 m survey which is of similar depth and are similarly faint compared to radio pre - selected submm sources .",
    "remaining mis - identifications , redshift or temperature differences between the two populations , and small number statistics / cosmic variance all may contribute to this difference , at levels that are hard to quantify from currently available data .",
    "our result reinforces the view that direct ( e.g. , wide band co ) spectroscopic redshifts may be necessary for a substantial fraction of the ( sub)mm population which is very faint in the optical / near - infrared . from a comparison of near - infrared / submm / radio spectral indices with those of submm sources with co - confirmed redshifts we suggest that the fraction of ( sub)mm galaxies at z@xmath02.5 is about two thirds for the interferometrically located ones and larger when adding the radio - undetected part of the population .",

    "<S> the median redshift of the radio - identified mm sources is @xmath12.6 from the radio / mm estimator , and the median optical / near - infrared photometric redshifts for the objects with counterparts @xmath12.1 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that those radio - identified mm sources without optical / near - infrared counterparts tend to lie at higher redshifts than those with optical / near - infrared counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> compared to published identifications of objects from 850@xmath2 m surveys of similar depth , the median k and i magnitudes of our counterparts are roughly two magnitudes fainter and the dispersion of i - k colors is less . </S>",
    "<S> real differences in the median redshifts , residual mis - identifications with bright objects , cosmic variance , and small number statistics are likely to contribute to this significant difference , which also affects redshift measurement strategies . </S>",
    "<S> some of the counterparts are red in j - k ( @xmath320% ) , but the contribution of such mm objects to the recently studied population of near - infrared selected ( j@xmath4-k@xmath4@xmath02.3 ) high redshift galaxies is only of the order a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> the recovery rate of mambo sources by pre - selection of optically faint radio sources is relatively low ( @xmath125% ) , in contrast to some claims of a higher rate for scuba sources ( @xmath170% ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this difference , the mambo sources also appear significantly fainter ( @xmath11.5 magnitudes in the i - band ) than radio pre - selected scuba sources . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss basic properties of the near - infrared/(sub)mm / radio spectral energy distributions of our galaxies and of interferometrically identified submm sources from the literature . from a comparison with submm objects with co - confirmed spectroscopic redshifts </S>",
    "<S> we argue that roughly two thirds of the ( sub)mm galaxies are at z@xmath32.5 . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction is probably larger when including sources without radio counterparts . </S>"
