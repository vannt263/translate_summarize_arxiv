    "we report on the complex dynamics and possible applications of a novel _ neural automaton _ or cellular automaton @xcite inspired in neurobiology .",
    "the model exhibits dynamic associative memory , including kind of switching behavior that has been reported for neural networks with dynamic synapses @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our automaton incorporates fast fluctuations of synaptic intensities which depend on neuron activity .",
    "such noise  induces instability of the recalling dynamics in a way that mimics how the brain efficiently solves some complex tasks .",
    "in fact , a rapid response to highly changing stimuli is believed to play a functional role during both attention and sequential processing of parallel sensory information @xcite . in this report , we adapt a previous proposal @xcite to show that fast synaptic noise can control the complexity and chaoticity of dynamics and , in particular , the details of the temporal oscillations of the neural activity .",
    "unlike in earlier work molgedeyprl , @xcite , @xcite the noise intensity in the present mechanism varies autonomously , which could be more relevant to the self - control of chaos in neural systems as well as in other cases .",
    "the model consists of @xmath0 cooperative and , for simplicity , fully ",
    "connected neurons with stochastic dynamics .",
    "a main feature is that , at each time step @xmath1 , the individual states of @xmath2 neurons are simultaneously updated .",
    "this is performed according to a modification of the hopfield prescription @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we assume that each neuron @xmath3 endures a current or a local field @xcite , bibitchkov : @xmath4here , @xmath5 is a neuron configuration and @xmath6 stands for a set of random variables , @xmath7 each affecting a postsynaptic neuron , of distribution @xmath8 this amounts to assume short  time , rapid synaptic fluctuations which , in fact , are known to influence and often determine the neuron activity in many natural processes .",
    "see @xcite for a technical justification of ( efflf ) , and @xcite for a recent discussion on the role of synaptic noise , for instance .",
    "this model has already been analyzed both analytically and numerically for certain choices of parameters .",
    "in particular , the case @xmath9 of sequential updating  was shown to exhibit complex hopping between the attractors in some cases @xcite , and we recently demonstrated @xcite that the hopping may become chaotic for little dynamics , namely , @xmath10 we here illustrate a typical situation between these two limits by means of computer simulations . the case with @xmath11 for which we present some results here happens to be relevant to understand the possibility of controlling chaos of the neural activity by means of synaptic noise .    in order to deal with model simulations that remain versatile enough",
    ", we need to introduce some simplifications in the following ; notice , however , that some of them may turn irrelevant to the resulting emergent behavior .",
    "most convenient is to restrict ourselves to binary neurons , i.e. , @xmath12 which are known to capture the essentials of cooperative phenomena abbott2states , @xcite . concerning the stochastic variable , we need to determine both its nature and its distribution .",
    "a simple choice is to assume that synaptic intensities are of the form @xmath13where @xmath14 are average weights which , also for the sake of simplicity , we shall consider to be of the hebbian type .",
    "that is , @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 stands for @xmath18 ( binary ) patterns that are assumed hereafter to be _  stored _ in the system .",
    "it then naturally follows stochasticity of the presynaptic currents in ( efflf ) which are given by @xmath19 this is consistent with actual features of natural systems such as , for example , variations of the glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft , and differences in the potency released from different locations on the active zone of the synapses franksjneurosci .",
    "these and similar noises  which cause synaptic fluctuations are typically very fast compared to the time relaxation of the whole neuron system .",
    "therefore , it seems sensible to assume that , in the time scale for the neuron activity , neurons behave as in the presence of a steady distribution for the synaptic fluctuations .",
    "this is taken into account by means of the distribution @xmath20 in ( [ efflf ] ) , a situation which is discussed with further detail in @xcite .",
    "recent neurobiological findings @xcite , concerning activity - dependent processes may help in determining @xmath21 in particular , it was reported short - time synaptic _ depression _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , that synaptic weights tend to decrease under repeated presynaptic activation .",
    "a simple way of implementing this in ( [ efflf ] ) is by taking @xmath22 \\mathrm{\\ } \\delta ( x_{j}-1)\\right\\ } ,   \\label{bimod}\\]]where the factorization is for simplicity and @xmath23 is the @xmath18-dimensional overlap vector of components @xmath24 in accordance with the mentioned observation , ( [ bimod ] ) implies that increasing the mean firing rate , which will increase the probability function @xmath25 will make more likely that synaptic intensities decrease by a factor of @xmath26 the hopfield model , for which such depressing noise is absent , corresponds here to the limit @xmath27 .",
    "finally , in order to fully determine the model , one may use the choice @xcite @xmath28 ^{2 } , $ ] where @xmath29 is the network load parameter @xcite .",
    "after some straightforward algebra , one obtains the effective currents as @xmath30 ^{2}\\right ) \\sum_{\\mu } \\xi _ { i}^{\\mu } m^{\\mu } \\left ( \\mathbf{s}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{lfaprox}\\ ] ]    in addition to the discussed synaptic stochasticity , that we represent here by means of the variable @xmath31 there are independent causes for assuming an stochastic dynamics of the neuron system .",
    "that is , a neuron may sometimes remain silent even if it endures a large current .",
    "this is naturally modelled by introducing a temperature  parameter @xmath32 in practice , one usually assigns a probability which depends on @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a threshold , to the change according to @xmath35 at time @xmath36 this mechanism is equivalent to assume the existence of a hypothetical thermal bath  which induces stochasticity of the neuron activity by means of a master equation .",
    "in general , this equation implies a tendency towards equilibrium .",
    "however , in the present case , the canonical tendency competes with the stochastic changes of @xmath37 which impedes equilibrium , and the system goes asymptotically to a non - equilibrium steady state @xcite .",
    "this complex , non - equilibrium situation is at the origin of the intriguing behavior we describe next .",
    "the above programme was implemented in the computer by iterating the following monte carlo algorithm :    1 .",
    "store @xmath18 different patterns @xmath16 in the average weights @xmath38 according to the chosen , e.g. , hebb s _ learning rule_. 2 .   set any state @xmath39 at random .",
    "3 .   compute the @xmath0 local fields @xmath40 as defined in ( [ lfaprox ] ) .",
    "4 .   choose a site ( neuron ) at random , repeat the choice @xmath0 times and keep only the @xmath41 sites which differ from each other ( this procedure lets you with @xmath42 sites for the values of @xmath0 of interest here ) .. ] 5 .   perform the changes @xmath43 at the chosen @xmath44 sites using the standard rate @xmath45 \\right\\ } .$ ] 6 .",
    "increase time in one unit , and go to step @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the resulting behavior for a single pattern , i.e. , it corresponds to the limit @xmath47 this shows a complex hopping process between the pattern , @xmath48 , and the _ anti - pattern _",
    ", @xmath49 the figure compares the evolution at a finite temperature with that in the absence of thermal fluctuations to demonstrate that hopping is not a consequence of the latter .",
    "consequently , in order to avoid the short  length oscillations shown in the bottom graph of figure [ fig1 ] , which are induced by the thermal noise , we are concerned in the following with simulations at @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates a main result , namely , that the frequency and other details of the hopping strongly depend on the value of the parameter @xmath51 which modulates the fast synaptic noise .",
    "an appropriate measure of the associated entropy will provide a quantitative description of the complexity of this hopping . using standard fast fourier transform algorithms , we computed the power spectra @xmath52 the normalized probability @xmath53 then allows one to define a regular entropy as @xmath54 .",
    "this quantity has been used before to detect regularity out of chaotic activity in actual neurons @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath55 is to be associated with chaotic behavior while @xmath56 would correspond to periodic dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] depicts the entropy which results in our case as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "this shows a minimum which corresponds to the smallest degeneration in the time series of figure [ fig2 ] ( second graph from the top ) .",
    "decreasing @xmath58 indicates a tendency to regularization or smaller chaoticity , while higher chaos and irregularity in the time series corresponds to larger values of @xmath59",
    "we have introduced a class of _ hybrid _ neural automata with two main features . on one hand ,",
    "these models provide a convenient arena to analyze the influence of fast synaptic noise on the retrieval process . on the other hand",
    ", they may describe a continuous transition from sequential , single ",
    "neuron updating to the case of little dynamics or parallel updating as one varies the model parameter @xmath60 the synaptic noise is modelled trying to mimic recent observations , namely , the noise occurs in a short  time scale and conveniently couples to the neuron activity to induce synaptic _",
    "depression_. depending on the intensity of this depression , the model exhibits a varied emergent behavior , including chaotic hopping between the attractors .",
    "this results in a rather complex pattern of neural activity . monitoring",
    "the entropy suggests how a fast noise might provide a mechanism to control chaos in living systems @xcite , schiffnature .",
    "the design of a mechanism in which noise intensity varies autonomously could be useful to the self - control of chaos .",
    "notice in this respect that manipulating @xmath44 in the model might be convenient for the purpose .",
    "that is , two main cases follow altogether from the present analysis and some previous work @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath61 for which the system is sensible to an external stimulus , which may destabilize the attractor , but it does not exhibit autonomous hopping between attractors ; and ( 2 ) @xmath62 for which hopping occurs autonomously , without the need for any external stimulus . in the latter case ,",
    "as far as @xmath63 the parameter @xmath57 allows for a control of the hopping , while this always occurs at high frequency for @xmath10 for @xmath64 the case for which we report some results here , the time the neuron activity stays at or near each attractor may be varied by tuning @xmath65 as illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] .",
