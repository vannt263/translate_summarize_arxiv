    "<S> we introduce a general framework for biological systems that describe modifications of type enzyme - substrate or swap with intermediates , which we call messi systems , and which allows us to prove general results on their dynamics from the structure of the network , under mass - action kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> this subclass of mechanisms has attracted considerable theoretical attention due to its abundance in nature and the special characteristics in the topologies of the networks .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea in the definition of messi systems ( see definition  [ def : messi ] ) is that the mathematical modeling reflects the different chemical behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical species can be grouped into different subsets according to the way they participate in the reactions , very much akin to the intuitive partition of the species according to their function . </S>",
    "<S> we show that messi systems are conservative ( and thus all trajectories are defined for any positive time ) , and we study the important questions of persistence and multistationarity . </S>",
    "<S> informally , persistence means that no species which is present can tend to be eliminated in the course of the reaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multistationarity ( see definition  [ def : multi ] ) is also a crucial property , since its occurrence can be thought of as a mechanism for switching between different response states in cell signaling systems and enables multiple outcomes for cellular - decision making , with the same total amounts .    </S>",
    "<S> examples of messi systems of major biological importance are phosporylation cascades , such as the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) cascades @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mapks are serine / threonine kinases that play an essential role in signal transduction by modulating gene transcription in the nucleus in response to changes in the cellular environment , and participate in a number of disease states including chronic inflammation and cancer @xcite as they control key cellular functions @xcite . </S>",
