    "only 5% of the mass of the universe is `` bright matter '' , but 99% of this visible matter is described by qcd , the theory of the strong interactions .",
    "qcd has been described as a nearly perfect theory , with the only parameters being the masses of the current quarks  @xcite .",
    "the vast bulk of visible matter is therefore `` emergent '' phenomena arising from the rich dynamics of the qcd vacuum and the interactions of the fundamental quark and gluon constituents of qcd .",
    "although we have enough information from a wide range of experimental data and from numerical lattice computations that qcd is the right theory of the strong interactions , outstanding questions remain about how a variety of striking phenomena arise in the theory .",
    "this is because the complexity of the theory also makes it very difficult to solve .",
    "our focus in this review is on high energy scattering in qcd .",
    "a traditional approach to these phenomena is to divide them into `` hard '' or `` soft '' scattering , corresponding respectively to large or small momentum exchanges in the scattering . in the former case , because of the `` asymptotic freedom '' of qcd , phenomena such as jets can be computed in a perturbative framework . in the latter case , because the momentum transfer is small , the `` infrared slavery '' of qcd suggests that the coupling is large ; the scattering therefore is intrinsically non - perturbative and therefore not amenable to first principles analysis .",
    "this is problematic because `` soft '' dynamics comprises the bulk of qcd cross - sections .",
    "in contrast , the perturbatively calculable hard cross - sections are rare processes .",
    "we shall argue here that the traditional separation of hard versus soft qcd dynamics is oversimplified because novel semi - hard scales generated dynamically at high energies allow one to understand highly non - perturbative phenomena in qcd using weak coupling methods . to clarify what we mean , consider inclusive cross - sections in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments of electrons off hadrons .    to 5 cm @xmath0    inclusive cross - sections in dis ( see figure [ fig : diskinematics ] )",
    "can be expressed in terms of the lorentz invariants i ) @xmath1 which corresponds , at lowest order in perturbation theory , to the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by a parton in the hadron , ii ) the virtual photon four - momentum squared @xmath2 exchanged between the electron and the hadron , iii ) the inelasticity @xmath3 , the ratio of the photon energy to the electron energy in the hadron rest frame , and iv ) the center of mass energy squared @xmath4 .",
    "these satisfy the relation @xmath5 . instead of the dichotomy of `` hard '' versus `` soft '' , it is useful , for fixed @xmath3 , to consider two asymptotic limits in dis that better illustrate the qcd dynamics of high energy hadron wavefunctions .",
    "the first , called the bjorken limit , corresponds to fixed @xmath1 with @xmath6 .",
    "the second is the regge - gribov limit of fixed @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in the bjorken limit of qcd ,",
    "one obtains the parton model wherein the hadron is viewed , in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) , as a dilute collection of valence quarks and `` wee '' ( in the terminology coined by feynman ) partons  small @xmath1 gluons and sea quark pairs .",
    "albeit the number of wee partons is large at high energies , the hadron is dilute ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig : hera - gluon ] ) because the phase space density is very small for @xmath10 . in this limit , to leading order in the coupling constant , the interaction of a probe with the hadron , on the characteristic time scale @xmath11 , can be expressed as a hard interaction with an individual parton . in this `` impulse approximation '' , the interaction of the struck parton in the hadron with co  moving partons is suppressed due to time dilation .",
    "the separation of hard and soft scattering alluded to previously is valid here .",
    "powerful tools such as the operator product expansion ( ope ) and factorization theorems extend , to high orders in the coupling constant expansion , the hard - soft separation between process - dependent physics at the scale @xmath11 and universal , long distance , non - perturbative parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the evolution of the separation of hard and soft scales is given by renormalization group ( rg ) equations called the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) equations  @xcite .",
    "the study of strong interactions in the regge - gribov limit predates qcd , and underlies concepts such as soft pomeron and reggeon exchanges , whose dynamics , described by `` reggeon field theory '' ( rft ) , was believed to encompass much of the phenomena of multi - particle production .",
    "albeit phenomenologically very suggestive  @xcite , the dynamics of rft is intrinsically non - perturbative and therefore not easily amenable to systematic computations . with the advent of high energy colliders ,",
    "hadron structure in the regge - gribov limit can be explored with @xmath12 gev@xmath13 .",
    "as strikingly demonstrated by the hera dis data shown in figure  [ fig : hera - gluon ] , the gluon distribution @xmath14 in a proton rises very fast with decreasing @xmath1 at large , fixed @xmath7  roughly , as a power @xmath15 with @xmath16 . in the imf frame of the parton model",
    ", @xmath14 is the number of gluons with a transverse area @xmath17 and a fraction @xmath18 of the proton longitudinal momentum . ] . in the regge - gribov limit ,",
    "the rapid rise of the gluon distribution at small @xmath1 is given by the bfkl ( balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ) equation  @xcite , which we will discuss at some length later .",
    "the stability of the theory formulated in the imf requires that gluons have a maximal occupation number of order @xmath19 .",
    "this bound is saturated for gluon modes with transverse momenta @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a semi - hard scale , the `` saturation scale '' , that grows as @xmath1 decreases . in this novel `` saturation '' regime of qcd",
    "@xcite , illustrated in figure  [ fig : hera - gluon ] ( right panel ) , the proton becomes a dense many body system of gluons .",
    "in addition to the strong @xmath1 dependence , the saturation scale @xmath22 has an @xmath23 dependence because of the lorentz contraction of the nuclear parton density in the probe rest frame .",
    "the dynamics of gluons in the saturation regime is non - perturbative as is typical of strongly correlated systems .",
    "however , in a fundamental departure from rft , this dynamics can be computed using weak coupling methods as a consequence of the large saturation scale dynamically generated by gluon interactions .",
    "thus instead of the `` hard '' plus `` soft '' paradigm of the bjorken limit , one has a powerful new paradigm in the regge - gribov limit to compute the bulk of previously considered intractable scattering dynamics in hadrons and nuclei .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) is the description of the properties of saturated gluons in the imf in the regge - gribov limit .",
    "the effective degrees of freedom in this framework are color sources @xmath24 at large @xmath1 and gauge fields @xmath25 at small @xmath1 . at high energies , because of time dilation , the former are frozen color configurations on the natural time scales of the strong interactions and are distributed randomly from event to event .",
    "the latter are dynamical fields coupled to the static color sources .",
    "it is the stochastic nature of the sources , combined with the separation of time scales , that justify the `` glass '' appellation .",
    "the `` condensate '' designation comes from the fact that in the imf , saturated gluons have large occupation numbers @xmath26 , with typical momenta peaked about a characteristic value @xmath27 .",
    "the dynamical features of the cgc are captured by the jimwlk jalilian - marian , iancu , mclerran , weigert , leonidov , kovner . ]",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) equation that describes how the statistical distribution @xmath28 $ ] of the fast sources at a given @xmath1 scale evolves with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "the jimwlk rg is wilsonian in nature because weakly coupled fields integrated out at a given step in the evolution are interpreted as `` induced color charges '' that modify the statistical weight distribution .",
    "the cgc framework is quite powerful because , given an initial non - perturbative distribution of sources at an initial scale @xmath29 , it allows one to compute systematically @xmath30-point gluon correlation functions and their evolution with @xmath1 order by order in perturbation theory . in analogy",
    "to parton distribution functions in the bjorken limit , the distribution @xmath28 $ ] captures the properties of saturated gluons .",
    "unlike pdfs however , which in the imf are parton densities , @xmath28 $ ] carries much more information .",
    "further , in contrast to the `` twist '' expansion of the bjorken limit which becomes extremely cumbersome beyond the leading order in @xmath11 , the cgc framework includes all twist correlations . like the pdfs , the @xmath31 s are universal : the same distributions appear in computations of inclusive quantities in both lepton - nucleus and hadron - nucleus collisions .",
    "the cgc is interesting in its own right in what it reveals about the collective dynamics of qcd at high parton densities .",
    "the cgc rg equations indicate that at fixed impact parameter a proton and a heavy nucleus become indistinguishable at high energy ; the physics of saturated gluons is universal and independent of the details of the fragmentation region .",
    "this universal dynamics has a correspondence with reaction ",
    "diffusion processes in statistical physics .",
    "in particular , it may lie in a `` spin glass '' universality class . understanding the nature of color screening and `` long range order '' in this universal dynamics offers possibilities for progress in resolving fundamental qcd questions regarding properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry .",
    "a specific area of progress is in the mapping of the cgc degrees of freedom to the traditional language of pomerons and the consequent prospects for understanding soft qcd dynamics . in nuclear collisions ,",
    "cgc dynamics produces `` glasma '' field configurations at early times : strong longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields color screened on transverse distance scales @xmath32 .",
    "these generate long range rapidity correlations , `` sphaleron - like '' topological fluctuations characterized by large chern - simons charge , and instabilities analogous to those seen in qed plasmas .",
    "the cgc framework is applicable to a wide variety of processes in e+p / a , p+a and a+a collisions .",
    "it provides an _ ab initio _ approach to study thermalization in heavy ion collisions and the initial conditions for the evolution of a thermalized quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the interaction of hard probes with the glasma is little understood and is important for quantifying the transport properties of the qgp precursor . a further phenomenological application of the cgc is to the physics of ultra high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "there are several reviews that discuss various aspects of the cgc and its applications in depth  @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to provide a broad pedagogical overview of the current status of theory and phenomenology for non - experts .",
    "the next section will focus on the theoretical status , while section 3 discusses the cgc in the context of dis , hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
    "section 4 presents the experimental results that probe the dynamics of saturated gluons .",
    "we will end this review with a brief outlook .",
    "we will begin this section with an elementary discussion of qcd bremsstrahlung in the regge - gribov limit and use this discussion to motivate the bfkl equation , how it leads to gluon saturation and describe key features of saturation .",
    "the theoretical status of the cgc effective theory is then presented .",
    "the section ends with a discussion of some advanced topics that highlight open issues .",
    "the structure of a hadron depends upon the scales resolved by an external probe .",
    "quantum fields bound within the hadron can radiate other virtual quanta which , by the uncertainty principle , live only for a short period of time .",
    "therefore , what looks like an isolated quantum at a given resolution scale reveals a complicated substructure when probed with finer space ",
    "time resolution .",
    "the structure of the hadron in the imf is specified by the longitudinal ( @xmath33 ) and transverse ( @xmath34 ) momentum distributions of its quanta and by their correlations  the latter become increasingly important with increasing density .    in perturbative qcd , parton evolution proceeds via bremsstrahlung , which favors the emission of _ soft _ and _ collinear _ gluons .",
    "the left part of figure  [ fig : cascade ] illustrates this elementary radiation process .",
    "when @xmath35 , to lowest order in @xmath36 , the differential probability for this emission is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the su@xmath39 casimir in the color representation of the emitter @xmath40 for a gluon and @xmath41 for a quark .",
    "this formula demonstrates the collinear ( @xmath42 ) and soft ( @xmath43 ) singularities mentioned above , which produce a logarithmic enhancement of gluon emission at small @xmath34 and/or @xmath1 .",
    "if the emitter at small @xmath1 were a quark instead a gluon , there would be no small @xmath1 enhancement ; while the collinear enhancement is present for either emitter .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the spin @xmath44 nature of the gluon .",
    "a high energy scattering such as the one illustrated in the right part of figure  [ fig : cascade ] probes the number of gluons with a given @xmath1 and transverse momenta @xmath45 . from eq .",
    "( [ brem ] ) , the gluon number is @xmath46 where the cutoff @xmath47 has been introduced as a crude way to account for confinement : when confined inside a hadron , a parton has a minimum virtuality of @xmath48 .    in qcd",
    ", gluons can radiate softer gluons and thus rapidly multiply as illustrated in figure  [ fig : cascade ] .",
    "each subsequent emission is @xmath36 suppressed however when the final value of @xmath1 is small , these corrections become large . for a cascade with @xmath30 intermediate gluons",
    "strongly ordered in @xmath1 , one obtains @xmath49 when @xmath50 , the correct result for the gluon distribution is obtained by summing contributions from all such ladders .",
    "the sum _ exponentiates _ , modifying eq .",
    "( [ eq : ng-1 ] ) into @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a number of order unity which is not fixed by this rough estimate . the variable @xmath53 is known as the _",
    "rapidity_.    to go beyond this simple power counting argument , one must treat more accurately the kinematics of the ladder diagrams and include the associated virtual corrections .",
    "the result is the previously mentioned _ bfkl equation _ for the @xmath53-evolution of the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "the solution of this equation , which resums perturbative corrections @xmath54 to all orders , confirms the exponential increase in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unintp ] ) , albeit with a @xmath34-dependent exponent and modifications to the @xmath55-spectrum of the emitted gluons .    an important property of the bfkl ladder is _ coherence in time_. because the lifetime of a parton in the imf , @xmath56 , the `` slow '' gluons at the lower end of the cascade have a much shorter lifetime than the preceding `` fast '' gluons .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of small @xmath1 dynamics , fast gluons with @xmath57 act as _ frozen color sources emitting gluons at the scale @xmath1_. because these sources may overlap in the transverse plane , their color charges add coherently , giving rise to a large color charge density .",
    "the _ average _ color charge density is zero by gauge symmetry but fluctuations in the color charge density are nonzero and increase rapidly with @xmath58 .",
    "these considerations are at the heart of the cgc reformulation of bfkl evolution . however , in contrast to the original bfkl formulation , the cgc formalism @xcite includes _ non  linear _ effects which appear when the gluon density becomes large .    the quantity which controls gluon interactions in the imf is their _ occupation number_the number of gluons of a given color per unit transverse phase  space and per unit rapidity , @xmath59 where the impact parameter @xmath60 is the gluon position in the transverse plane . if @xmath61 , the system is dilute and gluon interactions are negligible . when @xmath62 gluons start overlapping , but their interactions are suppressed by @xmath63",
    "the interaction strength becomes of order one when @xmath64 .",
    "it is then that non  linear effects become important leading to gluon saturation .",
    "gluon occupancy is further amplified if instead of a proton we consider a large nucleus with atomic number @xmath65 .",
    "the transverse area scales like @xmath66 , and the gluon occupation number scales as @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for a large nucleus , saturation effects become important at larger values of @xmath1 than for a proton .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us discuss a simplified version of the non  linear evolution equation for the occupation number .",
    "consider an elementary increment in rapidity : @xmath68 .",
    "each preexisting gluon in the hadron has a probability @xmath69 to emit an additional soft gluon  the average increase is @xmath70 .",
    "further , the emission vertex is non - local in @xmath34 because the transverse momentum of the parent gluon is shared among the two daughter gluons . at high - energies , this non - locality",
    "is well approximated as a _ diffusion _ in the logarithmic variable @xmath71 .",
    "finally , two preexisting gluons can merge and produce a single final gluon with rapidity @xmath72 .",
    "this process is quadratic in @xmath73 and leads to a negative term in the evolution equation .",
    "adding up these three effects , one obtains the evolution equation @xmath74 where @xmath52 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are numbers of order unity .",
    "this equation mimics the bfkl equation @xcite if one drops the term quadratic in @xmath73 in the r.h.s . , and mimics its non - linear extensions that include saturation if one keeps the quadratic term .",
    "although a toy model , eq .   captures essential features of saturation @xcite .",
    "thus , gluons with momentum @xmath77 are emitted from a quasi - neutral patch of color sources , and their occupation number grows only _ linearly _ in @xmath53 @xcite  much slower than the exponential growth in the region @xmath78 . ] .",
    "if @xmath79 , one can neglect the quadratic term , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : glr ] ) predicts an exponential growth in @xmath53 of the gluon occupation number .",
    "but when @xmath80 , the negative non - linear term turns on and tames the growth .",
    "in fact , eq .",
    "( [ eq : glr ] ) has a fixed point at @xmath81 where its r.h.s .",
    "vanishes  the evolution stops when this value of @xmath30 is reached , resulting in gluon saturation in the spirit of early works  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : glr ] ) also reveals the emergence of a transverse momentum scale @xmath82 that characterizes saturation .",
    "this scale is the @xmath34 where gluon occupancy becomes of @xmath83 . as a function of transverse momentum ,",
    "the occupation number @xmath84 is @xmath83 if @xmath85 , and decreases rapidly above @xmath82 ( @xmath86 for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath84 as a function of @xmath34 is known as the _ saturation front_. note that @xmath22 , the typical gluon transverse momentum at the rapidity @xmath53 , increases with energy and becomes a semi - hard scale ( @xmath88 ) at sufficiently high energy .",
    "( [ eq : glr ] ) belongs to the generic class of _ reaction - diffusion processes _",
    "@xcite . these are processes where an entity can hop to neighboring locations ( diffusion term @xmath89 ) , can split into two identical entities ( the term @xmath90 ) , and where two entities can merge into a single one ( the term @xmath91 ) . in the limit of large occupation numbers ,",
    "these processes admit the mean field description of eq .",
    "( [ eq : glr ] ) , which in the context of statistical physics is known as the _ fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation _  @xcite . in qcd ,",
    "the closest equation of this type is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the bk and fkpp equations , originally noticed in @xcite , clarifies the properties of saturation fronts in qcd in analogy with known properties of reaction  diffusion processes .",
    "a crucial property is the emergence of _ traveling waves_. the saturation front generated by this equation propagates without distortion at constant speed ; one has @xmath92 with @xmath93 a constant .",
    "this property has been verified in numerical studies of the bk equation  @xcite and in analytic studies of the bfkl equation in the presence of a saturation boundary  @xcite .",
    "it provides a natural explanation of the _ geometric scaling _ phenomenon observed in the hera data  @xcite ( see section [ sec : coll - dis ] ) . in qcd ,",
    "a front moving with constant speed @xmath93 is equivalent to the saturation momentum increasing exponentially with @xmath53 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is some non - perturbative initial scale . for a large nucleus , @xmath96 scales like @xmath67 as does @xmath97 for any @xmath53 .",
    "this form of the saturation momentum is modified to @xmath98 when the running of the strong coupling is taken into account ; see  @xcite for a detailed study of higher order effects on the energy dependence of @xmath22 .",
    "the cgc is an _ effective field theory ( eft ) _ based on the separation of the degrees of freedom into fast frozen color sources and slow dynamical color fields  @xcite .",
    "a _ renormalization group equation _",
    "the jimwlk equation @xcite ensures the independence of physical quantities with respect to the cutoff that separates the two kinds of degrees of freedom .",
    "the fast gluons with longitudinal momentum @xmath99 are frozen by lorentz time dilation in configurations specified by a color current @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the corresponding color charge density . on the other hand ,",
    "slow gluons with @xmath102 are described by the usual gauge fields @xmath25 of qcd .",
    "because of the hierarchy in @xmath33 between these two types of degrees of freedom , they are coupled eikonaly by a term @xmath103 .",
    "the fast gluons thus act as sources for the fields that represent the slow gluons .",
    "although it is frozen for the duration of a given collision , the color source density @xmath104 varies randomly event by event .",
    "the cgc provides a gauge invariant distribution @xmath105 $ ] , which gives the probability of a configuration @xmath24 .",
    "this functional encodes all the correlations of the color charge density at the cutoff scale @xmath106 separating the fast and slow degrees of freedom . given this statistical distribution , the expectation value of an operator at the scale @xmath106 is given by @xmath107\\;w_{\\lambda^+}\\big[\\rho\\big]\\;{\\cal o}\\big[\\rho\\big]\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath108 $ ] is the expectation value of the operator for a particular configuration @xmath24 of the color sources .",
    "the power counting of the cgc eft is such that in the saturated regime the sources @xmath24 are of order @xmath109 . attaching an additional source to a given feynman graph",
    "does not alter its order in @xmath110 ; the vertex where this new source attaches to the graph is compensated by the @xmath109 of the source .",
    "thus , computing an observable at a certain order in @xmath111 requires the resummation of all the contributions obtained by adding extra sources to the relevant graphs . the leading order in @xmath111",
    "is given by a sum of tree diagrams , which can be expressed in terms of classical solutions of the yang - mills equations .",
    "moreover , for inclusive observables  @xcite , these classical fields obey a simple boundary condition : they vanish when @xmath112 .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) computations in the cgc eft involve a sum of one - loop diagrams embedded in the above classical field . to prevent double counting , momenta in loops are required to be below the cutoff @xmath106 .",
    "this leads to a logarithmic dependence in @xmath106 of these loop corrections .",
    "these logarithms are large if @xmath106 is well above the typical longitudinal momentum scale of the observable considered , and must be resummed .    for gluon correlations inside the the hadron wavefunction and also for sufficiently inclusive observables in a collision , the leading logarithms are universal and can be absorbed into a redefinition of the distribution @xmath105 $ ] of the hard sources .",

    "this operator contains up to two derivatives @xmath115 , and arbitrary powers in @xmath24 .",

    "the derivation of the jimwlk equation will be sketched in the section [ sec : coll - dis ] .",
    "numerical studies of jimwlk evolution were performed in @xcite .",
    "an analytic , albeit formal , solution to the jimwlk equation was constructed in @xcite in the form of a path integral .",
    "alternatively , the evolution can can be expressed as an infinite hierarchy of coupled non - linear equations for @xmath30-point wilson line correlators  often called the balitsky hierarchy  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the bk equation is a mean field approximation of the jimwlk evolution , valid in the limit of a large number of colors @xmath116 .",
    "numerical studies of the jimwlk equation  @xcite have found only small differences with the bk equation .",
    "let us finally comment on the initial condition for the jimwlk equation which is also important in understanding its derivation .",
    "the evolution should start at some cutoff value in the longitudinal momentum scale @xmath117 at which the saturation scale is already a ( semi)hard scale , say @xmath118  gev , for perturbation theory to be applicable .",
    "the gluon distribution at the starting scale is in general non  perturbative and requires a model .",
    "a physically motivated model for the gluon distribution in a large nucleus is the mclerran - venugopalan model  @xcite . in a large nucleus",
    ", there is a window in rapidity where evolution effects are not large but @xmath1 is still sufficiently small for a probe not to resolve the longitudinal extent of the nucleus . in this case ,",
    "the probe `` sees '' a large number of color charges , proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "these charges add up to form a higher dimensional representation of the gauge group , and can therefore be treated as classical color distributions  @xcite .",
    "further , the color charge distribution @xmath119 $ ] is a gaussian distribution in @xmath24 .",
    "the variance of this distribution the color charge squared per unit area is proportional to @xmath67 and provides a semi - hard scale that makes weak coupling computations feasible .",
    "in addition to its role in motivating the eft and serving as the initial condition in jimwlk evolution , the mv model allows for direct phenomenological studies in p+a and a+a collisions in regimes where the values of @xmath1 are not so small as to require evolution .    the dynamics of small x gluons in qcd may be universal in more than one sense  @xcite .",
    "a weak form of this universality is that their dynamics in both hadrons and nuclei is controlled only by the saturation scale with its particular dependence on energy and nuclear size .",
    "a stronger form of the universality is noticed in particular for the solution of the bk equation with running coupling effects ; the saturation scale , for both hadrons and nuclei , at fixed impact parameter , becomes the same asymptotically with increasing energy  @xcite .",
    "the strongest form of the universality is that the rg flows in the saturation regime have a fixed point corresponding to universal `` critical '' exponents describing the behavior of multi - parton correlation functions . as discussed further below , the rg equations for high energy qcd lie in a wide class of reaction - diffusion processes which have universal properties remarkably close to those of spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "diffusion processes exhibit an extreme sensitivity to _ particle number fluctuations _",
    "@xcite , generated by gluon splittings , which produce correlations among pairs of gluons @xcite .",
    "this effect is of higher order in @xmath120 , and is linear in @xmath30 since it results from the splitting of a single gluon .",
    "conversely , producing two gluons without this splitting leads to a term that has one less power of @xmath120 , but of order @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the splitting contribution is important in the _ dilute _ regime where @xmath122 .",
    "since , as mentioned previously , the dynamics of the saturation front is driven by the bfkl growth of its dilute tail , these fluctuations play an important role in the 2gluon density @xmath123 at high energy .    as manifest in eq .",
    ", this 2-gluon density enters in the non  linear term leading to saturation of the single gluon density .",
    "thus , gluon number fluctuations in the dilute regime can strongly influence the approach towards saturation .",
    "for instance , as argued in @xcite for generic reaction  diffusion processes , and independently in the qcd context@xcite , these fluctuations reduce the ( average ) speed of the saturation front . besides making the value of @xmath22 a fluctuating quantity , they tend to wash out the geometric scaling property of the individual fronts @xcite .",
    "both effects are quantitatively important , as shown by explicit numerical simulations within various reaction  diffusion models ( including those inspired by the qcd dynamics at high energy @xcite ) .",
    "there is presently no general theory that includes bfkl ladders , saturation and fluctuations .",
    "( in terms of feynman graphs , this corresponds to resumming `` pomeron loops '' diagrams to all orders @xcite . )",
    "attempts to construct such a theory @xcite have led to incomplete formalisms that are difficult to exploit in phenomenological applications .",
    "fortunately , the effect of these fluctuations is considerably reduced by the running of the strong coupling @xcite , which tends to postpone their importance to unrealistically large rapidities .",
    "thus , for practical applications at least up to lhc energies , a sufficient theory for the approach towards saturation is the leading  order mean - field evolution extended with running coupling corrections .",
    "this theory has developed significantly as the running ",

    "these events were coined `` ridge '' events following from the visual appearance of these structures as an extended mountain ridge in the @xmath254-@xmath251 plane associated with a narrow jet peak .",
    "this collimated correlation persists up to @xmath255  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of ridge correlations is that the above described structure is seen in two particle correlations without a jet trigger ( see figure  [ fig:2hadron ] ) and persists without significant modification for the triggered events  @xcite .",
    "these events include all hadrons with momenta @xmath256 mev . in such events ,",
    "a sharp rise in the amplitude of the ridge is seen  @xcite in going from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "the ridge structures seen in two particle and three particle  @xcite a+a correlations can be explained as resulting from the transverse radial flow of the glasma flux tubes we discussed previously in section [ sec : aa ] .",
    "the flux tubes are responsible for the long range rapidity correlation in the ridge ; the angular collimation occurs because particles produced isotropically in a given flux tube are collimated by the radial outward `` hubble '' hydrodynamic flow of the flux tubes .",
    "ideas on the angular collimation of particle distributions by flow were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . when combined with the long range rapidity correlations provided by the glasma flux tubes , they provide a semi - quantitative description of the ridge measurements  @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies are feasible with realistic hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite .",
    "we note that the phenix collaboration which also observed ridge - like structures  @xcite have presented preliminary data showing that ridge - like structures disappear as the @xmath161 of the trigger particle is increased  @xcite ; this result is in qualitative agreement with expectations in the glasma flux tube picture . for a recent critical evaluation of this and alternative models ,",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "at the lhc , very low values of @xmath1 will be probed in p+p , a+a ( including the photo - production induced dynamics of peripheral a+a collisions ) and possibly p+a collisions through a wide range of final states and diverse kinematic ranges . in nuclei , @xmath257 will be large ; estimates range from @xmath258-@xmath259 gev@xmath13 in central collisions to @xmath260 gev@xmath13 for @xmath261 units .",
    "the picture of strongly correlated albeit weakly coupled dynamics of glue in the cgc eft outlined here will be tested as never before .",
    "detailed tests of bfkl dynamics and possibly even the cgc are feasible in p+p collisions in studies respectively of mueller - navelet  @xcite and forward jets .",
    "diffractive final states , while always challenging to interpret , offer opportunities to understand deeply how saturated gluons generate rapidity gaps .",
    "a strong test of cgc dynamics will already be available in `` day 1 '' physics of bulk dynamics in a+a collisions .",
    "more subtle tests of the rg flow of multi - parton correlators are available in a variety of final states ranging from quarkonia to electromagnetic probes to long range rapidity correlations . in p+a collisions at the lhc",
    ", many of the patterns seen in forward single inclusive and di - hadron correlation spectra will be present already at central rapidities and will be much more dramatic at forward rapidities .",
    "finally , the role of glasma dynamics relative to that of the quark - gluon plasma in a+a collisions at the lhc is still unclear . if rhic has reached the perfect hydrodynamic limit of maximal flow , what happens at the lhc ?",
    "studies of the dynamics of gluon saturation and the cgc that are complementary to the lhc can be performed at a future electron - ion collider ( eic ) .",
    "firstly , with a wide lever arm in @xmath7 , the dynamics of saturation can be studied with precision in the regime where @xmath262 ; this is difficult to achieve at a hadron collider .",
    "secondly , clarifying what aspects of the dynamics probed are universal and novel calls for an electron probe .",
    "the factorization theorems we have developed here suggest that the density matrices @xmath31 are universal  how can we confirm this and cleanly extract their rich dynamics ?",
    "these issues are not merely academic and are strongly reflected in the structure of final states .",
    "for example , rapidity gaps are a large fraction of the cross - section at hera but are a much smaller contribution in hadronic collisions at fermilab , demonstrating a breakdown of factorization  @xcite .",
    "the physics case for an eic / lhec has been outlined in @xcite and in a number of white papers and reports .    in summary ,",
    "the prospects for unambiguous discovery and exploration of a novel many body qcd regime of gluon saturation are very bright in the next decade .",
    "the theoretical status of studies of this regime within the framework of the cgc eft are increasingly robust albeit may questions remain .",
    "it is hoped that experiments , as usual , will provide definitive answers .",
