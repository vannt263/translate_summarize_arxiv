    "entanglement ,  _ the _ _ characteristic trait of quantum mechanics ",
    "_ according to erwin schroedinger , is playing an increasing role in nowadays physics @xcite .",
    "it is the irrevocable signature of quantum nonlocality , i.e. the scientific paradigm today recognized as the fundamental cornerstone of our yet uncertain understanding of the universe .",
    "the striking key process , the  _ bolt from the blue _  [ i.e. from the skies of copenhagen ] according to leo rosenfeld @xcite , was of course the epr discovery in 1935 followed by a much debated endeavour ended , in the last few decades by the lucky emergence of  the bell s inequalities and by their crucial experimental verification  @xcite . in the last years",
    "the violation of these inequalities has been tested so many times by optical experiments that ( almost ) no one today challenges the completeness of quantum nonlocality .    in the modern science of quantum information ( qi )",
    "entanglement represents the basis of the exponential parallelism of future quantum computers @xcite , of quantum teleportation @xcite and of some kinds of cryptographic communications @xcite .",
    "it appears largely significant that the most successful and reliable applications of entanglement have been obtained so far in the field of quantum optics .",
    "there the electromagnetic modes are associated with ",
    "qubits  which are generally encoded by the field polarization @xmath1@xcite .",
    "this type of qubit encoding is precisely the one considered in the present work .",
    "the @xmath2entanglement arises within the spontaneous emission process ( spontaneous parametric down conversion :  spdc ) in a nonlinear optical crystal under suitable conditions , as we shall see shortly . in this process ,",
    "a pair of correlated photons are generated at wavelengths ( wl ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 and momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 by a quantum electrodynamical  ( qed ) annihilation of a pump photon with wl @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 .",

    "the source of entanglement adopted today almost exclusively in quantum optics is based on spdc in a type ii noncollinear ",
    "phase matched  nonlinear ( nl ) crystal in which a pair of mutually orthogonally polarized photons is generated over a set of correlated directions corresponding to two different emission cones @xcite .",
    "the cones intersect each other in two particular correlated modes with k - vectors @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the overall quantum state emitted over these two modes may be expressed by either bell state @xmath20 , depending on a preset nl  crystal orientation . by a careful spatial selection of the two correlated k - vectors @xmath18 ,",
    "e.g. by two narrow pinholes , a high purity entangled state may be generated by this kind of source .",
    "the typical achievable coincidence count rate is of the order of few hundreds @xmath21 in a typical case involving a @xmath22 thick nl crystal excited by a @xmath23 uv pump laser .",
    "more recently , paul kwiat has realized a different source of  @xmath2entangled pairs , an order of magnitude brighter than the previous one , based on spdc emission by a set of two thin , orthogonally oriented type i crystal slabs placed stuck in mutual contact @xcite .    in the present work we report on a novel spdc  source of polarization - entangled pairs , recently developed in our laboratory @xcite ,",
    "that we believe represents the ultimate solution in the framework of quantum optics in terms of  universality and flexibility of generation of entangled states . the new solution , besides realizing the maximum attainable  quantum efficiency   @xmath24 , i.e. relative  brightness  , allows the detection of _ all _ spdc  entangled pairs emitted by spdc over the _",
    "entire _ set of wavevectors excited by any parametric scattering process .",
    "in particular , we  have investigated in the present work the most efficient , @xmath25degenerate process : @xmath26 .",
    "note briefly in this connection that the present source , when applied to any bell inequality test , allows to overcome substantially the  _ quantum - efficiency _",
    "`` loophole '' , which refers to the lack of _ detection _ of  _ all couples _ of emitted  correlated photons @xcite .",
    "this loophole should indeed be considered to be properly ascribable to the limited efficiency of the detectors as well as to the loss of the pairs created in any single qed  spontaneous emission process that do not reach the detectors for geometrical reasons .",
    "we shall account about this subtle process in a forthcoming paper dealing with nonlocality tests undertaken by means of inequalities ( bell - bohm)@xcite with and without making recourse to inequalities ( hardy ) @xcite .",
    "the present work is mostly devoted to investigate theoretically and experimentally a quite new branch of qi , the one concerned with the properties of several relevant families of _ mixed - entangled states . _",
    "because of the unavoidable effects of the decohering interactions indeed these states are today considered the basic constituents  of modern qi and quantum computation as they limit the performance of  all quantum communication protocols including quantum dense coding _  _ @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "_  _ it is not surprising that in the last few years , within an endeavour aimed at the use of _ mixed - states _ as a practical resource _ , _ an entire new branch of arduous mathematics and topology has been created to investigate the unexplored theory of the _ positive - maps _ ( _ p - maps _ ) in hilbert spaces in view of the assessment of the  _ residual _ _ entanglement  _ and of the establishment of more general `` _ state_-_separability _ '' criteria @xcite .",
    "very recently this ambitious study has reached results that are conceptually relevant , as for instance the discovery of a _ discontinuity _ in the structure of the _  mixed - state _ entanglement_. _",
    "precisely _ , _ the identification of  two classes : the _ free_-_entanglement _ , useful for quantum communication , and the _ bound - entanglement _ , a _",
    "non - distillable _ mysterious process , elicited a fascinating new horizon implied by the basic question : what is the role of _ bound _ entanglement in nature @xcite ?",
    "a consistent and wide range investigation of these useful and outmost appealing aspects of modern physics reqires the availability of a universal , flexible source by which entangled _ pure _ as well _ mixed - states _ of _ any _ structure could be easily enginerered in a reliable and reproducible way .",
    "the novel high - brilliance source described in the present work indeed possesses these properties and , consistently with the above considerations , it will be applied first to the realization and to a quantum tomographic analysis of  the werner _  _ states with variable mixing parameters @xcite . at",
    "last , the relevant `` _ maximally entangled mixed states _ '' ( mems ) , today of large conceptual and technological interest , have been easily created and tested by the same techniques @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section ii the high - brightness source is fully described .",
    "moreover the high quality of the realized output entangled state is demonstrated by a bell - inequality test showing the attainment of a nonlocal interferometric visibility as large as @xmath27 and a violation of a bell inequality by 213 standard deviations .",
    "section iii reports on a novel  patchwork  method to generate a full set of werner states .",
    "in addition , the results of a quantum tomographic investigation of their properties shall be reported . in section",
    "iv the methods of the previous section will be extended to a theoretical and experimental study of the mems . in sectionv",
    "the epr  nonlocality of the mems and of the werner states shall be taken up in a unifying manner by a variational analysis of the correlation functions .",
    "finally , the foreseable perspectives of the new method will be outlined in section vi .",
    "the active element of the new source of polarization - entangled photon pairs consisted of a single type - i nl thin crystal slab , @xmath28-barium - borate ( bbo ) ,  excited in two opposite directions @xmath29 by a uv pump beam with wl @xmath7 , back - reflected by a spherical mirror @xmath30 :  figure 1 .",
    "each of the two equal but independent spdc processes generated pairs of correlated photons with wavelengths ( wl ) @xmath31 , @xmath32 , _ equal _ polarizations @xmath33 and with a spatial distribution of the corresponding , mutually correlated k - vectors @xmath18 consisting of two equal , opposite _ circular _ cones ( dubbed as  @xmath0 * -*cones*)*@xmath34with axes @xmath35 @xcite . while all the relevant features of the present source are shared by all _ non - degenerate _ phase - matched wl configurations , i.e.@xmath36=@xmath37 with @xmath38 ,",
    "our present demonstration has been ( and the present discussion will be ) carried out mostly for the _ degenerate _ case for simplicity and without loss of generality : @xmath39 .",
    "suppose that the nl  crystal orientation is preset as to generate spdc  pairs on both @xmath0 * -*cones with any linear polarization , say @xmath40 .",
    "each pair of each @xmath0 * -*cone is then emitted with a product state @xmath41 over its own @xmath42dimensional hilbert space .",
    "suppose now that the two @xmath0 * -*cones are made to overlap into a _",
    "one with axis @xmath8 , i.e. directed towards the right hand side ( r.h.s . )  of fig.1 , by back - reflection over @xmath43 of the @xmath0 * -*cone with axis @xmath44 .",
    "if in the flight from the crystal to @xmath45 and back the polarization of the corresponding emitted pairs is flipped by any unitary transformation , i.e. @xmath46 and a phase @xmath47is added , the state of the pair detected on the ( r.h.s . )  of fig.1 is the _ entangled _ state : @xmath48{0xbd}}% % beginexpansion { \\frac12}% % endexpansion } \\left ( |h_{1},h_{2}\\rangle + e^{i\\phi } |v_{1},v_{2}\\rangle \\right ) \\label{phi}\\ ] ]  since this argument holds for _ any _ pair of correlated @xmath18-vectors emitted with equal probability and equal wl @xmath49 , all diametrally opposite points of the spatial circle obtained by interception with a plane of the output cone , i.e. belonging to the ",

    "of course , as for all quantum interference phenomena , the @xmath0 * -*cone overlapping should be perfect as to realize the  _ in principle indistinguishability _  of  the actual origin of the detected pair for any set of _ ideal _ detectors coupled to the output of the source .",
    "all this represents the key process underlying the present work .",
    "let us now give more details of the apparatus ( fig .",

    "the laser beam were then back - reflected by a spherical mirror @xmath43  with curvature radius @xmath55 , highly reflecting@xmath56both @xmath49 and @xmath7 , placed at a distance @xmath57 from the crystal .",
    "a zero - order @xmath58 waveplate ( wp ) placed between @xmath59and the nl  crystal , i.e. indicated as  @xmath60zone  in fig.1 , intercepted twice both back - reflected @xmath49 and @xmath7 beams and then rotated by @xmath61 the polarization of the back - reflected field with wl @xmath62while leaving virtually undisturbed the polarization state of the uv  pump beam . in facts , it was verified that the @xmath58  wp acted closely as a @xmath63 wp since @xmath64 . the phase @xmath65",
    "@xmath66  of the generated pure entangled state , eq.([phi ] ) was reliably controlled by micrometric displacements @xmath67of @xmath43along @xmath8 .",
    "the phase stability , representing the most challenging experimental problem , was solved by adoption of various tricks , among which vital was the use of the _ same _ back - mirror @xmath43 for both wl s @xmath49 , @xmath7 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "a positive lens ( @xmath68 ) transformed the overall emission  _ conical _ distribution  into a _",
    "cylindrical _ one with axis @xmath8 , whose transverse circular section identified the ",
    "_ entanglement - ring  _",
    "( _ e - ring _ ) with diameter @xmath69 .",
    "each couple of  points symmetrically opposed through the center of the ring are then correlated by quantum entanglement , as said .",
    "an annular mask with diameter @xmath70 and width @xmath71 provided in the present experiment a very accurate spatial selection of the _ e - ring_. this one was divided in two equal portions along a vertical axis by a prism - like two - mirror system and then focused by two lenses on the active surfaces of two independent photodiodes @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( _ alice _ and _ bob _ ) by which standard bell measurements could be performed by means of polarization analyzers ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "typically , two equal interference filters ,  placed in front of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 detectors , with bandwidth @xmath77 , determined the _ coherence - time _ of the emitted photons :  @xmath78 _  _",
    "@xmath79 optionally , the focusing could have been done on the ends of two optical fibers that could convey the radiation to two far apart detection stations @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the insertion of one ( or several ) waveplates of filters partially ( or fully ) intercepting the radiation associated with the @xmath0 * -*cones in ( or ouside ) the @xmath80-zone allowed the realization of  various configurations of relevant physical significance .",
    "for instance , the insertion of a zero - order @xmath81 wp in one of the output detection arms allowed to locally transform eq.([phi ] ) into the state :    @xmath82{0xbd}}% % beginexpansion { \\frac12}% % endexpansion } \\left ( |h_{1},v_{2}\\rangle + e^{i\\phi } |v_{1},h_{2}\\rangle \\right ) \\label{psi}\\ ] ]    then , by easily setting @xmath83  of @xmath84 eq.1 could be locally transformed in any one of the remaining three bell states . furthermore and most important , the insertion of a zero - order @xmath85 wp in the @xmath80-zone and intercepting _ only _ the uv  beam allowed the engeneering of tunable _ non maximally entangled _ states . as shown by lucien hardy , by this class of states expressed as : @xmath86",

    "the rotation of the uv  wp by an angle @xmath87  determines a @xmath88-rotation of the back - reflected uv  pump beam respect to the optical axes of the ( fixed ) nl  crystal slab .",
    "the consequent @xmath87-tunable unbalancement of the spdc  efficiencies over the two @xmath0 * -*cones affects the two interfering product - state terms in eq.([phi ] ) by a coefficient @xmath89 . by adjusting @xmath87 in the range @xmath90 , the _ degree of entanglement _ @xmath91 can be continuously tuned between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "successful , preliminary results of the hardy s ladder proof  obtained by adoption of the present source have been reported in @xcite .",
    "more complete data will be reported elsewhere .",
    "all these consideration are but a preliminary demonstration of the extreme flexibility of the present source . in the following sections we shall learn how , by a simple  _ patchwork _  technique approximately  _",
    "pure _  states can be easily transformed into  _ mixed _  states with various degree of mixedeness .",
    "this allowed us to undertake a comprehensive study of relevant quantum states as the werner states and the maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) .",
    "the structural characteristics of the quantum state of any photon pair generated by our source should be analyzed by accounting first for the excited electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "modes which , in our case are grouped in correlated pairs by the @xmath94wave spdc interaction .",

    "finally , owing to the linearity of quantum mechanics , the overall _ entangled - state _ expressing a single pair emission and detected at the output of our source after @xmath0 * -*cone overlapping and @xmath107phase delay may finally be expressed by the quantum superposition : @xmath48{0xbd}}% % beginexpansion { \\frac12}% % endexpansion } % % tcimacro{\\tsum } % % beginexpansion \\mathop{\\textstyle\\sum}% % endexpansion % tcimacro{\\qatop{n}{j:1}}% % beginexpansion { n \\atop j:1}% % endexpansion \\",

    "this should be indeed the _ exact _ form of the output state of the source , if the _  full set _ of @xmath100-modes could be coupled to the cathode of the detectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to find that this full coupling scheme is virtually _ made possible _ by the actual structure of our source in all possible wavelength configurations , either _ degenerate _ @xmath108 or _ non - degenerate _ @xmath109 . in other words ,",
    "an experiment may be conceived in principle ( an approximate one is in fact in progress in our laboratory ) by which the _ full set _ of qed  excited modes at any wavelength , ranging from very large @xmath31 down to @xmath110 can be coupled to the detectors _ without _ any geometrical constraint or spatial or @xmath49-filtering .",
    "of course , in this case severe limitations for a _ full _ _ particle _ _ detection _ come from the limited @xmath111extension of the photocathode @xmath112  and of the performance of  the optical components ( mirrors , lenses etc . ) .",
    "nevertheless , this does not affect _ in principle _ the _ structural character _ of the output entangled - state .",
    "note that in all spdc - based quantum optics experiment carried out so far , the set of @xmath103 modes coupled to the detectors was drastically reduced by the use of narrow spatial - filtering pinholes  @xcite . actually , the goal there was the realization of particle detection over a _",

    "these considerations lead to at least two important consequences :    \\a ) the _  high - brilliance _ of the source , due to the full output mode coupling was found experimentally to @xmath114 order of magnitudes larger than the conventional one based on spdc excited by a uv laser with the same intensity .",
    "\\b ) the _ quasi - purity _ of the generated output state may be considered as follows .",
    "the well known _ unitary _",
