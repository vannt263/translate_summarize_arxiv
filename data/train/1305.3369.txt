    "the discovery of topological insulators ( tis ) has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "@xcite a three - dimensional  ( 3d ) ti has a time - reversal invariant band structure with nontrivial topological order , which possesses an energy gap in the bulk and gapless metallic states on the surface .",
    "the surface band consist of an _ odd _ number of dirac cones with unconventional spin texture in the surface brillouin zone .",
    "one of the intriguing properties in such spin - textured surface states ( sss ) is their insensitivity to spin - independent scattering , which is protected from backscattering by the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "exotic excitations such as majorana fermions ,  @xcite magnetic monopole  @xcite and dynamical axion field  @xcite are predicted to exist as results of topological sss .",
    "soon after the theoretical prediction  @xcite , bi@xmath2sb@xmath3 alloy with composition @xmath4 ranged from @xmath5 to @xmath6 was found to be a ti with _ five _ dirac cones by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "@xcite arpes measurements observed topologically nontrivial sss , and the spin - resolved arpes measurements reported the helical spin texture of the massless dirac fermions in the system .",
    "@xcite however , the sss in bi@xmath2sb@xmath3 are rather complicated which can hardly be described by a simple model hamiltonian .",
    "subsequently , a family of binary compounds , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , was discovered and investigated as the second generation of tis .",
    "@xcite among them the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 contains only a _ single _",
    "dirac cone within the gap as large as @xmath7 mev , and as the `` hydrogen atom '' of tis is easier to study .",
    "the helical spin texture of sss in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is observed to be _ left - handed_.  @xcite all these characteristics suggest that direct backscattering between the time - reversal pair of helicity states with opposite momenta and spins is prohibited , and the anderson localization will not occur in these two - dimensional ( 2d ) helical liquid .",
    "in addition to the arpes , the low - temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) as well as microscope ( stm ) is another important probe in the ti research field , which provides a direct way to study the sss through measuring the local density of states ( ldos ) in the vicinity of various imperfections . due to the elastic scattering by impurities ,",
    "the incoming surface wave with a wavevector @xmath8 must be scattered into the outgoing one with @xmath9 on the same constant energy contour ( cec ) .",
    "the quantum interference between the incoming and outgoing waves gives rise to the standing wave oscillation with wavevector @xmath10 , which is often referred as the characteristic scattering wavevector , or the transferred momentum .",
    "energy - resolved fourier transform sts ( ft - sts ) can be used to obtain the scattering wavevectors of modulations in the ldos and detailed information on the symmetry as well as physics of scattering processes for the ss electrons .",
    "@xcite this technique has been proved valuable in studying the sss on noble metals  @xcite and on semiconductor surfaces ,  @xcite and even on the pairing symmetry of the high-@xmath11 superconductors  @xcite and the graphene .",
    "@xcite the absence of backscattering is a specular manifestation of the topological nature of the sss .",
    "different from the edge states in two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis , in which the forbidden back - scattering means the annihilation of all types of elastic scattering by the spin - independent potentials , the sss in 3d tis will experience single - particle elastic scattering associated with all scattering angles except for @xmath12 backscattering .",
    "thus investigating the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) caused by scattering off impurities and defects on the ti surfaces and revealing the topological nature of the sss through the ft - sts are interesting and useful , in particular based on combination of the theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "the qpi patterns induced by non - magnetic impurities on surfaces of bi@xmath13sb@xmath2 ,  @xcite bi@xmath0te@xmath1  @xcite and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ,  @xcite together with subsequent theoretical analysis ,  @xcite did demonstrate the absence of backscattering for the topological sss .",
    "meanwhile , the ldos oscillations of sss near step edges on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 showed a power - law decay with index @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for sss at different energy ranges ,  @xcite while in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 the decay index is fixed to be @xmath14 ,  @xcite compared to @xmath15 for the two - dimensional electron system  ( 2des ) .",
    "@xcite the faster decay of qpi pattern is believed to result from the suppression of backscattering in tis . for magnetic impurities on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 which breaks the trs , although the tr violating scattering vectors have been reported ,  @xcite it is still controversial whether the direct backscattering between the time - reversal pair is responsible for the unusual sensitivity to magnetic scattering .",
    "@xcite    so far intensive stm and arpes investigations have demonstrated the topological properties of sss ; however , a general picture of the qpi on the surface of various ti systems remains elusive , particularly when taking account of the quality of ti samples and the warping effect of the dirac cone .",
    "@xcite here , not only the anisotropic band dispersion of the sss , but also the warping effect includes coupling between the surface and bulk bands . in this article",
    "we will give a comprehensive review on elastic scattering of sss in various ti systems .",
    "the ss - la - phonon quasi - elastic scattering plays an important role in transport of sss ,  @xcite but not affect the qpi pattern significantly , so it will not be reviewed in this article . with the recent experimental results , we present a general formalism to account for the complex qpi on ti surface .",
    "we propose that the interference patterns are dominated by sss at the extremal points on the cec . in applying this theory to bi@xmath0te@xmath1 with strong warping effect ,",
    "we show that , when tuning the bias voltage , for scattering off a non - magnetic impurity the qpi wavevector depends on the shape of fermi surface sensitively , which varies from conical to @xmath17-@xmath18 and finally to @xmath17-@xmath19 , as the cec changing from circle to hexagon and finally to snowflake . and",
    "the decay index off a step edge also critically depends on the energy of sss , varying from @xmath14 to @xmath15 and finally to @xmath16 as the energy increases . as for tis with nearly isotropic dirac cone , such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ,",
    "@xcite according to our theory the decay index is simply @xmath14 . for the scattering off a magnetic impurity",
    ", the direct backscattering is allowed due to the trs breaking .",
    "however , we will show such backscattering between time - reversal pairs in the presence of trs breaking can be _ hardly _ seen in ldos by stm .",
    "therefore , the qpi pattern of magnetic impurity is still similar to that of non - magnetic impurity .",

    "the warped fermi surface in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 dominates scattering of sss with high energies relative to the dirac point . in the low - energy region where the dispersion of sss is conic and the scattering results in a simple circular pattern in the fourier - transformed qpi",
    "the low energy scattering pattern is also consistent with the helical spin texture of the topological sss that still allows all scattering processes except for the direct backscattering .",
    "the trs in tis is broken by doped magnetic impurities , so that in principle the backscattering process will occur , which is prohibited in ti with non - magnetic impurities only . here",
    "we focus on the effects of a classical magnetic impurity , which implies the kondo physics can be ignored .",
    "suppose the scattering potential of an magnetic impurity is @xmath202 where @xmath203 @xmath204 are the pauli matrices denoting the electron spin , @xmath205 is the expectation value of the local magnetic moment , and @xmath206 denotes the effective exchange coupling between electron spin and local magnetic moment . as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ tri ] ) , with trs , the backscattering is absent between a pair of tr - states of @xmath207 and @xmath178 .",
    "it is thus straightforward to prove the trs - breaking potential such as the potential of magnetic impurities can remove such a constraint on backscattering , because @xmath208 and @xmath209 however , such backscattering between tr pairs can _ hardly _ be observed in the ldos spectra .",
    "@xcite instead of having @xmath210 in the non - magnetic impurity case , here we have @xmath211 .",
    "suppose the magnetic moment of the impurity is along the @xmath212 direction , then the spin - up electrons and spin - down electrons experience opposite scattering potentials .",
    "thus to the lowest order of perturbation theory , the scattering amplitudes of the spin - up and spin - down electrons have opposite sign , so that the total interference pattern of the charge density vanishes almost everywhere .",
    "@xmath213 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i}v_i\\int\\frac{d^2k}{4\\pi}\\mathrm{tr}\\left[g_0(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)\\sigma_ig_0(\\mathbf{k+q},\\omega)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this argument no longer holds if higher orders of perturbation are considered .",
    "the higher order perturbations to the scattering amplitude would lead to similar results as in non - magnetic impurities .",
    "recently , madhavan s group reported the first tr violating scattering vectors in magnetically doped ti of bi@xmath0fe@xmath214te@xmath1 by using ft - stm di / dv maps .",
    "@xcite similar to previous studies ,  @xcite a sixfold symmetric pattern with intensity centered along the @xmath17-@xmath19 directions are observed above @xmath215  mev .",
    "remarkably , at low energies starting around @xmath216  mev , a new set of scattering vectors centered along @xmath17-@xmath18 directions have appears , not reported in prior studies . by comparing with arpes results",
    ", they claimed that the new scattering channels arose from the forbidden backscattering .",
    "however , at the energy @xmath217  mev where scattering vector along @xmath17-@xmath18 emerges for the cec similar to the hexagon in fig .",
    "[ impurity](c ) .",
    "the scattering vector by a non - magnetic or magnetic impurity should be along the @xmath17-@xmath18 direction solely due to the shape of fermi surface . therefore , whether these new scattering channels arise from the forbidden backscattering or not is still _",
    "unsettled_.    later , yazdani s group reported the standing wave patterns on mn - doped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the detailed fourier analysis of the qpi patterns in @xmath76-space shows that the short wavelength scattering in different samples have similar results , which is independent of whether the scattering dopant is magnetic or not , or even if magnetic order is established .",
    "the ft - qpi pattern consists of _ six _ strong peaks along the @xmath17-@xmath19 directions at high energies and circular patterns at lower ones .",
    "these results strongly support that in the presence of weak magnetic impurities the backscattering between time - reversal pairs can hardly be seen in the ldos .",
    "kimura s group reported the qpi pattern induced by cobalt adatoms on the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 surface by stm .  @xcite they find that co atoms are selectively adsorbed on top of se sites and act as strong scatter centers on the surface , generating anisotropic standing waves along @xmath17-@xmath19 directions .",
    "however , the long - range ferromagnetic order is found to be absent , and the dirac cone of sss remains gapless .",
    "the anisotropy of the standing waves at high bias voltage is ascribed to the heavily warped cec of unoccupied states . at low voltage",
    "the qpi patterns due to the occupied states near dirac cone vanishes , which suggests that the time - reversal protection of the topological sss persists even in the presence of co impurities .",
    "yandani s group studied the influence of the bulk - originated disorder potential on the short - wavelength interference patterns caused by the surface impurities in bi@xmath218mn@xmath219te@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite they find the wave vector shift of the qpi pattern in the real - space ldos with high and low voltages , which suggest the surface dirac electrons alter their wavelength to adjust to the underlying bulk disorder potential , and are not immune to such perturbations .",
    "whereas such fluctuations in momentum are a relatively weak perturbation to the dirac electrons with high energies ; near the dirac point they are comparable to the average value of the momentum .",
    "the lack of well - defined momentum near the dirac point due to the fluctuations reported is also likely to play a role in the apparent suppression of the arpes measured signals in magnetically - doped tis advocated recently .",
    "@xcite    madhavan s group used the stm and sts to investigate the effects of one - dimensional buckling on the electronic properties of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite by tracking spatial variations of the interference patterns generated by the dirac electrons , they show that buckling imposes a periodic potential , which locally modulates the ss dispersion . such potential induces the scattering along @xmath17-@xmath19 direction , which support the absence of backscattering and well - nesting of the snowflake - like cec .",
    "the theoretical and experimental investigations indicate that the ldos oscillation on the surface of tis is generally determined by the scattering between surface states around the extremal points on fermi surface , either by step edges or by non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the forbidden backscattering and suppressed standing wave oscillation clearly demonstrate the 2d dirac nature of topological surface states .",
    "the robustness of the topological surface states may have potential application in quantum computing or spintronics in the future .",
