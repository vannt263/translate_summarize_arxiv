    "within bayesian filter framework , the representation of the likelihood model is essential . in a tracking algorithm ,",
    "the scheme of object representation determines how the concerned target is represented and how the representation is updated .",
    "a promising representation scheme should accommodate noises , occlusions and illumination changes in various scenarios . in the literature ,",
    "a few representation models have been proposed to ease these difficulties @xcite .",
    "most tracking algorithms represent the target by a single model , typically built on extracted features such as color histogram @xcite , textures @xcite and correspondence points @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , these approaches are usually sensitive to variations in target appearance and illumination , and a powerful template update method is usually needed for robustness .",
    "other tracking algorithms train a classifier off - line @xcite or on - line @xcite based on multiple target samples .",
    "these algorithms benefit from the robust object model , which is learned from labeled data by sophisticated learning methods .",
    "recently , mei and ling proposed a robust tracking algorithm using @xmath0 minimization @xcite .",
    "their algorithm , referred to as the _ @xmath0 tracker _ ,",
    "is designed within particle filter ( pf ) framework @xcite .",
    "there a target is expressed as a _ sparse _ representation of multiple predefined templates .",
    "the @xmath0 tracker demonstrates promising robustness compared with existing trackers @xcite .",
    "however , it has following problems : firstly , @xmath0 minimization in their work is slow ; secondly , they use an over - complete dictionary ( an identity matrix ) to represent the background and noise .",
    "this dictionary , in fact , can also represent any objects ( including the user interested tracking objects ) in video .",
    "hence it may not discriminate the objects against background and noise .",
    "although the @xmath0 tracker @xcite is inspired by the face recognition work using _ sparse representation classification _",
    "( src)@xcite , it does nt make use of the sparse signal recovery power of compressed sensing ( cs ) used in @xcite .",
    "cs is an emerging topic originally proposed in signal processing community @xcite .",
    "it states that sparse signals can be exactly recovered with fewer measurements than what the nyquist - shannon criterion requires with overwhelming probability .",
    "it has been applied to various computer vision tasks @xcite .",
    "inspired by the @xmath0 tracker and motivated by their problems , we propose two cs - based algorithms termed _ real - time compressed sensing tracking _ ( rtcst ) and _ real - time compressed sensing tracking with background model _ ( rtcst - b ) respectively .",
    "the new tracking algorithms are tremendously faster than the standard @xmath0 tracker and serve as _ better _ ( in terms of both accuracy and robustness ) alternatives to existing visual object trackers such as those in @xcite .",
    "the key contributions of this work can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we make use of the sparse signal recovery power of cs to reduce the computational complexity significantly .",
    "that is we hash or random project the original features to a much lower dimensional space to accelerate the cs signal recovery procedure for tracking .",
    "moreover , we propose a customized _ orthogonal matching pursuit _ ( omp ) algorithm for real - time tracking .",
    "our algorithms are up to about @xmath2 times faster than the standard @xmath0 tracker of @xcite . in short ,",
    "_ we make the tracker real - time by using cs_. 2 .",
    "we propose background template rather than the over - complete dictionary in @xcite .",
    "this further improves the robustness of the tracking , because the representation of the objects and background are better separated .",
    "this new tracker , which is referred to as rtcst - b in this work , outperforms most state - of - the - art visual trackers with respect to accuracy while achieves even higher efficiency compared with rtcst .",
    "3 .   finally , we propose a new metric called _ tracking success probability _ ( tsp ) to evaluate trackers performance .",
    "we argue that this new metric is able to measure tracking results quantitatively and demonstrate the robustness of a tracker .",
    "consequently , all the empirical results are assessed by using tsp in this work .",

    "we verify our methods by comparing them against existing visual tracking methods in section [ sec : exp ] .",
    "conclusion and discussion can be found in the last section .",
    "in this section , we briefly review theories and algorithms closest to our work .      from a bayesian perspective , the tracking problem is to calculate the posterior probability @xmath3 of state @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the observed measurement at time @xmath5 @xcite . in principle , the posterior pdf is obtained recursively via two stages : prediction and update .",
    "the prediction stage involves the calculation of prior pdf : @xmath7 in the update stage , the prior is updated using bayes rule @xmath8    the recurrence relations and form the basis for the optimal bayesian solution .",
    "nonetheless , the solution of above problem can not be analytically solved without further simplification or approximation .",

    "however , they differ in how to seek a sparse representation which consequently lead to different observation likelihood @xmath15 estimtation .",
    "the underlying conception behind src is that in many circumstances , an observation belonging to a certain class lies in the subspace that is spanned by the samples belong to this class , and the linear representation is assumed to be sparse . hence , reconstructing the sparse coefficients associated with the representation is crucial to identify the observation .",

    "in this section , we present the proposed real - time cs tracking .      the biggest problem of @xmath0 tracking is the extremely high dimensionality of the feature space , which leads to heavy computation .",
    "more precisely , suppose that the cropped image of observation is @xmath54 , the dimensionality @xmath55 is typically in the order of @xmath56 , which prevents tracking from real - time .",

    "the hash kernel generates hash matrices more efficiently than conventional random matrices while maintains the similar random characteristics , which implies good rip .    in this work ,",

    "this significantly speeds up solving equation , for its complexity depends on @xmath68 polynomially .",
    "before the compressed sensing theory was proposed , numerous approaches had been applied for sparse approximation in the literature of signal processing and statistics @xcite .",
    "orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) is one of the approaches and solves in a greedy fashion .",
    "tropp and gilbert @xcite proved omp s recoverability and showed its higher efficiency compared with linear programming which is adopted by the original @xmath0 tracker of @xcite .",

    "we implement the sparse recovery procedure of the proposed tracker with omp so as to accelerate the tracking process .",
    "the number of measurements required by omp is @xmath73 for @xmath42-sparse signals , which is slightly harder to achieve compared with that in @xmath0 minimization .",
    "however , it is merely a theoretical bound for signal recovering , no significant impact of omp upon the tacking accuracy is observed in our experiments ( see section  [ sec : exp ] ) .",
    "the omp algorithm was proposed for recovering sparse signal exactly ( see equation ) , and the perfect recovery is also guaranteed within @xmath68 steps @xcite . however , in the realm of pattern recognition , we argue that there is no requirement for perfect recovery for many applications . for example , for classification problems , test accuracy is of interest and exact recovery does not necessarily translate into high classification accuracy .",
    "so on the contrary , an appropriate recovery error may even improve the accuracy of recognition @xcite .",
    "we introduce a residual based stopping criterion into omp by modifying as @xmath74 moreover , the procedure of omp could be accelerated remarkably if the above stopping criterion is enforced . to understand this ,",

    "figure [ fig : time_iter ] shows the empirical influence of the terminating criterion upon the running iterations and running time . in our algorithm , we empirically set the stopping threshold @xmath84 , which draws a balance between speed and accuracy .    .",
    "both the running time and iteration numbers are the average result over all the frames and particles . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      one noticeable advantage of the src - based tracker is the exploitation of multiple templates obtained from different frames .",
    "however , for the @xmath0 tracker , the number of templates @xmath85 should be curbed into strictly because it equals to the dimensionality of the optimization variable @xmath32 . to design a good @xmath0 tracker ,",
    "a trade - off between @xmath85 and the optimization speed is always required .",
    "fortunately , this dilemma dose not exist when the tracker is facilitated with omp and a carefully - selected sparsity @xmath42 .",
    "the computational burden of omp consists of two steps : one is for selecting the maximum correlated vector from matrix @xmath86 , and the other is for solving the least squares fitting . in step @xmath87 , it is trivial to compute the complexity of the first step is @xmath72 and that for least - square fitting is @xmath88 . accordingly , the running time of omp is dominated by solving the least - squares problem , which is independent of the number of templates , @xmath85 . in other words , _ within a certain number of iterations , the amount of templates would not affect the overall running time significantly_. this is an important and desirable property in the sense that we might be able to employ a large amount of templates .    admittedly , larger @xmath85 might lead to more iterations .",
    "however , if we impose a maximum sparsity @xmath42 , the omp procedure would only last for @xmath42 steps in the worst scenario . from this perspective ,",
    "a preset @xmath89 is capable to eliminate the influence of a large @xmath85 upon the running iterations .",
    "figure  [ fig : time ] depicts the change tendency of running time with increasing @xmath85 , given that @xmath90 , @xmath91 . as can be seen , the elapsed time is only doubled when @xmath85 is raised by @xmath92 times .     and @xmath93 .",
    "the recorded running time is the average time consumption for one omp procedure which calculates the observation likelihood for a particle .",

    "we try to harness the enormous target templates to accommodates the variation of illumination , gesture and occlusion and consequently improve the tracking accuracy .",
    "as regards the sparsity , we elaborately set @xmath95 for rtcst and @xmath91 for rtcst - b which is introduced in section  [ sec : rtcstb ] .",
    "we believe the numbers are sufficiently large for the representations .",
    "hereby , we sum up all the adjustments to omp mentioned in algorithm  [ alg : customized_omp ] .",
    "note that here we use the inner product rather than its absolute value to verify the correlation .",
    "this heuristic manner is used to make the recovered coefficient vector @xmath96 , approximately . for rtcst - b introduced in next section ,",
    "the absolute value of inner product is re - employed due to the absence of the positive constraint .",

    "this does not make much sense .",
    "actually , it may be intractable to design an ideal template re - weighting scheme that works in all the circumstances .",
    "a poorly - designed re - weighting scheme could even deteriorate the tracking performance .",
    "we abandon the template weight because the importance of templates be easily exploited by the compressed sensing procedure . without template weights ,",

    "quite the contrary , in the context of visual tracking , the background is much more limited with respect to appearance variation .",
    "particularly , for the stationary camera , the background is nearly fixed . under these assumptions , it is worthwhile exploiting the background information for tracking . and",
    "appropriate incorporations of background model indeed improve the tracking performance@xcite .",
    "we hereby propose a novel cs - based background model ( csbm ) to facilitate tracking algorithm .",
    "the definition of cs - based background model is quite simple .",
    "suppose that @xmath115 is the @xmath29th frame where foreground is absent , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the height and width of the frame respectively , we define the background model as @xmath118 or in short , the collection of @xmath119 backgrounds .",
    "the background templates are then generated from csbm to cooperate with target templates in our new tracker .",
    "please note that our algorithms is unrelated to the background subtraction manner proposed by volkan @xcite . in their paper ,",
    "foreground silhouettes are recovered via cs procedure but the background subtraction is still performed in conventional way . our csbm and rtcst - b is entirely different from their manner , both in essence and appearance .",
    "the details of csbm and its incorporation with rtcst are introduced below .",
    "a good csbm should only constitute `` pure '' backgrounds and contain sufficiently large appearance variation , , illumination changes .",
    "ideally , we could simply select certain number of foreground - absent frames from video sequence to build a csbm .",
    "however , the `` pure '' background is usually difficult to find and it is even harder to obtain the ones cover the main distribution of background appearance .    an intuitive way to obtain a clean background is replacing the foreground of one frame with a background patch cropped from another frame . more precisely ,",
    "let @xmath120 denote the frame based on which the background is retrieved , and @xmath121 stand for the frame where the background patch is cropped , suppose that the foreground region in @xmath122 is @xmath123 , the patching operation could be described as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the retrieved background .",

    "finally , a @xmath5-median clustering algorithm is carried out for selecting @xmath119 most comprehensive backgrounds .",
    "it is nontrivial to notice that even some backgrounds are not perfectly retrieved , , with minor foreground remains , csbm can still work well considering that cs is robust to the noise in measurements @xcite .",

    "apparently , the diversity between rtcst and rtcst - b is not significant with respect to formulation .",
    "nevertheless , the seemingly small change makes rtcst - b much more superior to its prototypes .",
    "compared with the @xmath0 tracker and rtcst , rtcst - b enjoys three main advantages which are described as follows .",
    "an underlying assumption behind the @xmath0 tracker and rtcst is that , the background could be sparsely represented by noise templates in @xmath143 .",
    "it is true when foreground dominates the observed rectangle .",
    "more quantitatively , given @xmath144 is the sparsity of target coefficient vector @xmath135 , when @xmath145 the representation based on solution @xmath32 in is guaranteed to be reliable @xcite . nonetheless , the sparse representation is no longer valid when the background covers the main part of observation .",
    "predictably , the incorrect representation will deteriorate tracking accuracy .    on the other hand ,",
    "after noise templates being replaced by background templates , the aforementioned assumption usually keeps true .",
    "figure  [ fig : rtcst_b_sparse ] give us a explicit demonstration for the sparsity of solutions .",
    "comparing with existing background models , the computation burden of csbm is extremely trivial .",
    "first of all , there is no need to conduct the background subtraction or foreground connection in rtcst - b , because these two functions are integrated within the cs procedure implicitly .",
    "secondly , if the csbm is generated properly , , can cover the main distribution of background s appearance , to update model becomes unnecessary .",
    "thirdly , the sufficient number of background templates is much smaller than that of noise template , , @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the number of noise templates .",
    "the reduction of templates amount will immediately speed up the optimization process .",
    "the last , and the most important reason is , the required sparsity @xmath42 for rtcst - b is much smaller than that for rtcst ( see section  [ susubbsec : inf_rcst ] ) .",
    "this leads to an earlier terminated omp procedure in rtcst - b and hence makes it faster . in conclusion",

    "one tries to use noise templates @xmath148 $ ] to represent background",
    ". however , it is the columns in @xmath149 , which is called _ standard basis vectors _ , does nt favor background images over targets .",

    "differing from the prototype , rtcst - b harnesses the discriminant nature of cs - based pattern recognition .",
    "both foreground ( target ) and background are treated as a typical class with distinct features . in rtcst - b ,",
    "target templates compete against background templates , who are as powerful as their competitors , to `` attract '' the observation .",
    "intuitively , the more discriminative templates will make rtcst - b more robust .",
    "moreover , once the tracked region drifts away , background information would be brought into target templates via template update ( which is almost unavoidable ) .",
    "in this situation , for rtcst and @xmath0 tracker , some target templates could be more similar to background than all the noise templates .",
    "this leads to a serious classification ambiguity and therefore , poor tracking performance .",
    "quite the contrary , rtcst - b could draw back the target to the correct position thanks to the capacity of recognizing background .",

    "as to the software , we use matlab @xmath159 and the linear programming solver is called from mosek @xmath160@xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in our experiment , _ no trick is used for selecting the target region in the first frame_. the initial target region is always the minimum rectangle @xmath161 $ ] which can cover the whole target , where @xmath162 , @xmath139 , @xmath78 , and @xmath163 are the left , right , top and bottom boundaries coordinates ( horizontal or vertical ) respectively .",
    "this rigid rule is followed for eliminating the artificial factors in visual tracking and making the comparison unprejudiced .",
    "a conventional choice of the manner to verify the tracking accuracy is _ tracking error_. specifically , given that the centroid of ground truth region is @xmath164 while that of tracked region is @xmath165 , the tracking error @xmath166 is defined as @xmath167 , the euclidean distance between two centroids .",

    "same performance is reported for both two trackers despite the obvious difference on tracking accuracy .    inspired by the evaluation manner proposed for pascal data base@xcite ,",
    "we propose a new tracking accuracy measurement which is termed _ tracking success probability _ ( tsp ) . to obtain the definition of tsp , firstly let s suppose the bounding box of ground truth region is @xmath168 $ ] , and the one for tracked region is @xmath169 $ ] .",

    "see figure  [ subfig : tsl ] for an instance .",

    "the difference implies that tsp is capable to accommodate dynamic factors besides displacement .",

    "all the empirical results are evaluated by tsp . as a reference ,",

    "all the best performances are observed with rtcst and rtcst - b for these video sequences .",

    "our methods , on the contrary , do much better than the competitors and handle some intractable sequences ( , _ pets2004_p1 _ and _ pets2004 - 2_p1 _ ) very smoothly ( with the tsp @xmath191 ) .",
    "particularly , for the camera - fixed scenes , rtcst - b is applied and always achieves the highest accuracy .",
    "the superiority of rtcst - b over all the other trackers confirms our assumption that higher accuracy would be achieved when the tracking is considered as binary classification problem .    besides the tsp values ,",

    "car4 _ and _ pets2002_p1 _ ; kms tracker on _ car4 _ and _ pets2002_p1_.    from the error curves shown in figure  [ fig : track_error ] , we can find that our methods beat other visual tracking algorithms on most video sequences except _ dp _ and _ fish_. given that all the trackers perform similarly for _ dp _ and video _ fish _ is generated with extreme illumination variation which is added deliberately , rtcst and rtcst - b could be considered better than their competitors in terms of accuracy .    to evaluate the new measurement , the tsp curves for _ cubicle _ and _ pets2002_p1 _ are also available in the figure  [ subfig : tsl_cubicle ] and figure  [ subfig : tsl_pets2002 ] .",

    "is consistently slower than @xmath195 due to the high computational complexity .",
    "being equipped with omp and dimension reduction manners , rtcst and rtcst - b are able to accelerate the original cs - based tracker by @xmath196 ( _ dp _ ) to @xmath197 ( _ pets2004_p1 _ ) times .",
    "the speed range for rtcst is @xmath198 while that for rtcst - b is @xmath199 .",
    "pf tracker shows unstable efficiency among all the tests .",
    "its running speed varies from @xmath200 to @xmath201 for the experiment with @xmath154 particles .",
    "supposed that the speed threshold for real - time application is @xmath202 , most of the traditional methods and a part of our methods are qualified .",
    "@xmath0 tracker could not be viewed as `` real - time '' from any perspective .",
    "moreover , since rtcst and rtcst - b are implemented in matlab with single core , their running speeds could be increased remarkably by employing c / c++ language and multiple cores .",
    "actually , the speed of matlab - based @xmath0 is already raised by @xmath203 ( _ pets2004_p1 _ ) to @xmath204 ( _ cubicle _ ) times in its c / c++ counterpart even though only one core is used .",
    "if we conservatively predict @xmath79-time speed growth , both rtcst and rtcst - b will be qualified for real - time application in all the circumstances .",
    "[ tab : run_time ]      as mentioned before , no trick is played to select the initial target region .",
    "the first region @xmath67 should always be the minimum bounding box covers the whole target .",
    "nonetheless , the bounding box could merely obtained manually , and hence , approximately . in practice",
    ", the selection error is unavoidable .",
    "if the visual tracker is not robust enough , minor selection error would lead to massive deviation with respect to tracking performance .",

    "this procedure is repeated for @xmath83 times for each tracker .",
    "afterwards , the mean @xmath215 and standard deviation @xmath216 of tsp values are calculated for each frame .",
    "finally , we plot the _ tsp band _ , which is a band changing along with frame index and covers the range @xmath217 $ ] , for every visual tracker .",
    "the new experiment is carried out on video sequence _",
    "pets2000_c1 _ and the _ tsp bands _ are demonstrated in figure  [ fig : robustness ] .",

    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    an ideal _ tsp band _ should be with small variance and centered around a relatively high mean .",
    "we can see that in figure  [ fig : robustness ] , rtcst and kms tracker show similar variance but rtcst has a higher tsp mean .",
    "pf tracker illustrates smaller variance but suffers from very low accuracy .",
    "rtcst - b comes with the highest average tsp value while still achieves smallest standard deviation . the experiment result exhibits the unstable nature of kms tracker with respect to original target position .",
    "meanwhile , it also confirms our conjecture about the presence of high robustness when background information is taken into consideration .",
    "in this paper , two enhanced cs - based visual tracking algorithms , namely , rtcst and rtcst - b are proposed .",
    "a customized omp algorithm is designed to facilitate the proposed tracking algorithms .",
    "hash kernel and random projection are employed to reduce the feature dimension of tracking application . in rtcst - b , a cs - based background model , which is termed csbm ,",
    "is utilized instead of noise templates .",
    "the new trackers achieves significantly higher efficiency compared with their prototype  the @xmath0 tracker . the remarkable speed growth , which is up to @xmath218 times , makes cs - based visual trackers qualified for real - time applications .",
    "meanwhile , our methods also obtain higher accuracy than off - the - shelf tracking algorithms , , pf tracker and kms tracker .",
    "particularly , rtcst - b achieves consistently highest accuracy and robustness thanks to the exploitation of background information . in short words ,",
    "the proposed rtcst and rtcst - b are sufficiently fast for real - time visual tracking and more accurate and robust than conventional trackers .    for future topics , we believe that one low - hanging fruit is employing the trick mentioned in @xcite by tropp to accelerate the omp procedure furthermore . another promising direction is to take color information into consideration because in many scenarios , color - based classification is more discriminant than the intensity - based one . the third direction of future research is treating different part of the target , left - top quarter and middle - bottom quarter , as different classes .",
    "as a result , a multiple classification is conduct within cs framework .",
    "the obtained likelihood for each particle then becomes a vector comprised of the confidences associated with various target parts . because the time consumptions for binary and multiple classification are the same when using cs - based manner , we actually obtain more information at the same cost .",
