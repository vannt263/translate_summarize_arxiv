    "<S> these results agree with a locally newtonian , continuum model , where the granular medium is assumed to behave as a liquid with a local temperature @xmath4 and density dependent viscosity .    </S>",
    "<S> an important property of granular matter is partial fluidization in response to shear stresses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> stationary granular matter can sustain normal loads and shear stresses , but if a threshold shear stress is exceeded , part of the material starts to flow with properties that appear to differ from those of a newtonian fluid . unlike ordinary fluids , granular materials do not exhibit intrinsic thermal motion . instead , the granular temperature , generally defined as the square of rms velocity fluctuations @xmath5 , is created by the flow itself . as a result , the mean </S>",
    "<S> flow and rms fluctuations are related . </S>",
    "<S> this fundamental connection has been investigated experimentally  @xcite , but remains poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> the flow of sheared granular materials has been investigated in the steady state in several experiments by shearing material in a couette cell between a stationary outer cylinder and a rotating inner cylinder  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all experiments indicate that the mean particle velocity parallel to the shear direction @xmath0 decreases faster than linearly away from the inner cylinder .    </S>",
    "<S> the velocity profile in three dimensions was determined by mueth _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements were carried out both in the interior of the material using x - ray and nmr techniques , and on the bottom surface of the couette cell by optical imaging . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements showed that the velocity profile on the bottom surface and in the interior are the same . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 varies from nearly gaussian for kidney shaped particles to roughly exponential for spherical particles . </S>",
    "<S> layering of particles is suggested as the cause of this variation .    in previous studies in a planar geometry  @xcite , we have found that most of the flow is confined to @xmath6 layers of particles close to the shear plane . </S>",
    "<S> the mean particle velocities during brief slips of the shearing plate decrease roughly exponentially with distance away from the moving plate , consistent with the findings in the couette geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present experiment is to understand the relationship between mean velocities , rms fluctuations and shear forces of a steady state shear flow . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a locally newtonian , continuum model that describes the granular medium as a liquid with nonuniform temperature and density dependent viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between mean flow and rms velocity fluctuations can be understood quantitatively in this context , as we demonstrate .    in order to accomplish fluidization independent of shear </S>",
    "<S> , we apply an upward airflow at a variable rate through granular matter sheared in a couette geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we measure both the mean particle velocities @xmath0 and the velocity fluctuations @xmath2 on the upper surface of the granular material . </S>",
    "<S> these should approximate particle motion in the interior based on the previous 3d measurements described above  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of shear forces in air fluidized granular matter , including a discussion of previous related studies of shear forces  @xcite , will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    in the experimental apparatus the granular material ( @xmath7 diameter black glass beads ) is confined to a @xmath8 gap between a stationary outer cylinder and a rotating inner cylinder ( @xmath9 ) , as shown in fig  [ exp_setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> the inner cylinder is hollow to reduce its inertia and is coated with a monolayer of randomly packed glass beads . </S>",
    "<S> the outer cylinder is made of glass and is coated with a monolayer of randomly packed glass beads up to the height of the top surface , which allows observation of the top layer of grains through a mirror as shown in fig  [ exp_setup ] . to shear the material , </S>",
    "<S> the inner cylinder is rotated at a variable rate of @xmath10 hz . </S>",
    "<S> the lower @xmath11 of the inner cylinder is stationary in order to minimize boundary layer effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the inner cylinder is connected to a microstepping motor via a flexible tempered steel spring . </S>",
    "<S> the spring bending is proportional to the applied shear force . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the spring displacement with a capacitive displacement sensor that is rigidly connected to the motor shaft . </S>",
    "<S> this spring configuration allows us to measure instantaneous shear forces with excellent dynamic range and precision , and permits both stick - slip dynamics and continuous motion of the inner cylinder , depending on parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories of roughly @xmath12 individual particles in the surface layer are determined with a fast ccd camera at @xmath13 frames / sec . </S>",
    "<S> particle motion is extracted from sequences of @xmath14 images with a spatial resolution of @xmath15 pixels . from the particle tracks we determine average particle velocities @xmath0 and rms velocity fluctuations @xmath2 as a function of distance @xmath1 from the rotating inner cylinder .    </S>",
    "<S> the shear dynamics without airflow are found to be very similar to the dynamics of a plate sliding across a granular layer  @xcite . at low shear rates </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the inner cylinder is intermittent with short , rapid slips , and long periods of sticking . at sufficiently high shear rates ( or with a stiff spring ) , steady motion of the inner cylinder is observed .    </S>",
    "<S> airflow has a strong effect on the shear forces and shear dynamics . without airflow , </S>",
    "<S> stick - slip motion is observed with a mean shear force of @xmath16 . at small airflow , </S>",
    "<S> the shear force is reduced , but stick - slip motion persists . at high airflow rates ( with a mean air speed of @xmath17 through the granular material ) , </S>",
    "<S> shear forces are reduced by a factor of 4 to @xmath18 and steady sliding motion is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments described below were carried out at large airflow just below the threshold of the bubbling instability . for @xmath19 mm diameter glass particles no motion on the upper surface is observed at this airflow in the absence of shear . </S>",
    "<S> the mean shear stress does not change with shear rate over more than two orders of magnitude in the shear rate . </S>",
    "<S> the shear forces will be discussed in detail elsewhere  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we note that airflow strongly reduces the shear strength of the material and changes the dynamics from stick - slip motion to steady sliding .    </S>",
    "<S> the average velocity of particles at the surface of the shear cell is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vel_profile ] as a function of distance @xmath1 from the rotating inner cylinder , for inner wall velocities @xmath20 ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 hz . </S>",
    "<S> as found previously , the velocity profile decays strongly to zero over a few particle diameters @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized velocity profile is independent of the imposed shear rate over at least two orders of magnitude in shear rate . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that without airflow ( at @xmath24 hz , solid triangles ) , the inner cylinder moves with stick - slip dynamics rather than steady sliding , but the velocity profile remains unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ vel_fluct ] shows the rms velocity fluctuations , which have not been previously measured in a 3d system . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations are slightly larger in the direction parallel to the mean flow than perpendicular to it . since parallel fluctuations would also include the effect of fluctuations in the mean flow , we show only the perpendicular fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity fluctuations decrease roughly exponentially far from the inner cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fluctuations decrease more slowly with @xmath1 than does the average velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> the rms fluctuation is the key quantity in a flowing granular material . </S>",
    "<S> as already proposed by reynolds @xcite , the system has to dilate in order to allow flow , which implies particle motion transverse to the flow direction . </S>",
    "<S> this transverse motion vanishes on average and , therefore , its rms fluctuations contain the physically relevant information characterizing the flow properties .    in a phenomenological description , </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to consider these rms velocity fluctuations as an effective _ granular temperature _ and consider a _ local _ hydrodynamic model as a starting point , as has already been proposed in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> within such a picture the granular temperature obeys a transport equation characterizing the balance between `` heat flow '' and dissipation due to the inelastic collisions : @xmath25 ( note that a local heating term has been omitted , which can be shown to be valid far from the moving boundary . ) this _ local _ equation introduces two transport coefficients , the thermal conductivity @xmath26 and the energy loss rate @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are proportional to the collision frequency . in the high density limit we consider , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 with @xmath29 the density at random close packing , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the isotropic pressure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> stress conservation in the @xmath1 direction implies that @xmath31 is constant over the cell . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ heateq ] ) , one can obtain the temperature profile as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , defined as @xmath34 , is proportional to the bead diameter @xmath23 , and is independent of position and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a vanishing heat flux has been assumed at the outer stationary boundary in agreement with additional experimental measurements for wider shear regions , while the temperature at the moving boundary , @xmath35 , is introduced as a boundary condition at the wall . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 is created by the flow in the first layers close to the wall , so that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ heateq ] ) is assumed to apply only for distance @xmath1 larger than a cutoff distance @xmath36 from the wall : @xmath36 quantifies the width of the boundary layer in which temperature is created by the motion of the inner cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to experimental data yields @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective cell width @xmath38 is thus @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the wall to wall distance . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ vel_fluct ] , this hydrodynamic model shows good agreement with the experimental data .    within the framework of this phenomenological model </S>",
    "<S> , the velocity profile can be constructed from the constant shear - rate condition , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the local shear rate and @xmath43 the viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> the viscosity is expected to scale with the collision frequency , @xmath44 ( where @xmath23 is the bead diameter , @xmath45 a dimensionless number and @xmath28 has been assumed ) , so that the local shear rate obeys @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this local relationship can be compared to the experimental data by plotting the local rms velocity as a function of the local velocity gradient @xmath47 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fluct_grad ] , a remarkable scaling relationship is found between these two local quantities , @xmath48 with an exponent @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling behaviour is not in agreement with the simple scaling of the viscosity with the collision frequency only , for which an exponent of @xmath50 would have been measured .    </S>",
    "<S> the actual scaling can be understood if we assume that the dimensionless coefficient @xmath45 contains an additional contribution that diverges algebraically , when the density reaches random - close packing , @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath51 . the density can be related to the granular temperature through the constant isotropic pressure @xmath31 , which can be formally written as @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless function @xmath53 is expected to diverge like @xmath54 at random close packing @xcite , so that at constant pressure @xmath31 , in a region where @xmath55 , one has @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this relation is consistent with reynold s remark that the density has to decrease in order to allow flow , which occurs for non - zero granular temperature . </S>",
    "<S> together with the constant shear rate condition , these relations imply a nonlinear algebraic scaling of @xmath2 with the shear rate , with an exponent @xmath57 . with the experimentally determined exponent @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the overall divergence of the viscosity with density as @xmath59 .    using the previously obtained temperature profile , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scaling ] ) can be integrated ( with no - slip boundary conditions at both walls ) to give the velocity profile . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding result is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ vel_profile ] as a dashed line , indicating good agreement with the experimental profile . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation also yields a relation between the boundary temperature @xmath35 and the shear rate @xmath20 , as @xmath60 in agreement with the experimental data ( not shown ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we measure granular flow when the gap between the two cylinders is only 5 particle diameters wide . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the inner cylinder jams and can only be moved at high airflow rates and high rotation rates . for the narrow gap we find that @xmath0 decreases linearly with @xmath1 and that @xmath2 is uniform across the gap at shear rates of @xmath61 rev./sec and @xmath62 rev./sec . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with our model : a linear velocity profile is expected for a constant granular temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a constant granular temperature in turn is expected for cell widths smaller than the previously defined decay length @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> the success of the present _ local _ _ hydrodynamic _ model in describing the experimental data ( even for small driving velocities ) calls for a deeper understanding . </S>",
    "<S> the basic ingredient of the present model is the algebraicly diverging viscosity close to random close packing . in a granular material , the ability to flow relies mainly on a decrease in the local density . </S>",
    "<S> such a decrease can be caused by the onset of rms velocity fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> lowering the density allows some particles to move , creating `` fluidized regions '' , while other regions remain in clusters at rest . </S>",
    "<S> the flow properties can be thus formulated in terms of the local fluidization probability , or cluster lifetime . in a granular material , </S>",
    "<S> these quantities might be estimated by means of a free volume estimate , along the lines proposed by edwards @xcite for granular matter and earlier by cohen and turnbull @xcite in the context of transport in glassy systems . </S>",
    "<S> these models predict a very strong divergence of the viscosity close to random close packing , in qualitative agreement with the present results . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , our data are consistent with an algrebraic divergence , which is also expected in supercooled liquids when the density moves off the critical density @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the model quantitatively describes all aspects of the experimental results : ( i ) the rms velocity fluctuations increase with the local shear rate to a given power . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the velocity decreases strongly away from the moving wall . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the normalized velocity profile is independent of shear rate and shear dynamics . more generally , </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results indicate that there may be a useful analogy between the dynamics of granular materials and the behavior of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> such an analogy was proposed in a recent paper by liu and nagel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results support this conjecture and indicate the quantitative relationship : the flow properties reported here are quantitatively predicted from a locally newtonian , continuum model , provided that the local temperature is identified with @xmath63 and that the viscosity is assumed to diverge as the density approaches a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the specific properties of individual particles only enter through the few adjustable parameters of the model . once determined in a specific geometry , the flow properties in any geometry can be predicted . </S>",
    "<S> further experiments are underway to verify this predictive power of the model . </S>"
