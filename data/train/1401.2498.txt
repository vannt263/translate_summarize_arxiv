    "in condensed matter physics , landau s symmetry breaking paradigm had been considered as the foundation to learn all types of orders .",
    "different ( quantum ) states are characterized by different symmetries and the associated local order parameters . however , in last 20 years , it became more and more clear that landau s paradigm can not describe all quantum states of the matter .",
    "the first example beyond landau s paradigm is the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect@xcite .",
    "the fqh states possess exotic topological orders and can not be described by symmetry breaking theory .",
    "the subtle structures that distinguish different fqh states are called _ _ topological order__@xcite .",
    "another example is the quantum spin liquid , which is an intriguing possibility for a strongly interacting magnetic system where the magnetically ordered ground state is avoided owing to strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "the subtle structures that distinguish different quantum spin liquid states are called _ _ quantum order__@xcite . in the projective space construction of spin liquid with the same ( global ) symmetry ,",
    "there exist many kinds of quantum spin liquids with different low energy gauge structures ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 ... ) . to distinguish different quantum spin liquids",
    ", the projective space symmetry group ( psg ) is proposed@xcite .",
    "people have tried to find such exotic quantum states in frustrated spin systems for more than twenty years@xcite .",
    "for example , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath3@xmath4 model is a typical frustrated heisenberg model on a square lattice .",
    "different methods show a similar result - a quantum disordered ground state appearing around @xmath5 .",
    "however , the nature of the quantum disordered ground state is still much debated@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we find that the fermionic superfluid ( sf ) may lose long range phase coherence due to quite strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "the strongly fluctuating fermionic sf possesses exotic quantum orders and also can not be described by landau s symmetry breaking theory .",
    "we call it _ quantum phase liquid _ ( qpl ) . in the qpl ,",
    "the fermions are paired and single quasi - particle s excitation has a finite energy gap .",
    "however , the strong quantum fluctuations destroy the long range phase coherence and the fermionic sf order parameter is still zero .",
    "namely , qpl state is a fermionic sf without phase coherence , and the excitations may be doublons or holons that correspond to the quantum states with the particle number @xmath6 or @xmath7 on each site , respectively .",
    "the single quasi - particle excitations corresponding to the quantum states with the particle number @xmath8 on each site are forbidden .",
    "it is found that physical properties of topological quantum phase liquids are quite different from those of topological quantum spin liquids  the external magnetic field induces a gas of topological excitations which will condense at zero temperature in a topological qpl .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the two dimensional generalized attractive hubbard model in a bipartite lattice , and discuss the pseudo - spin symmetry of the model . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce projective space construction of qpls in analogy to quantum spin liquids . in sec .",
    "iv we mainly study two types of topological qpls with a small external magnetic field .",
    "the first one is @xmath0 topological qpls with the small external magnetic field studied in sec .",
    "iv a , and the other is the topological chiral qpls with the small external magnetic field investigated in sec .",
    "iv b. finally , in sec .",
    "v , we conclude our discussions .",
    "our starting point is the two dimensional generalized attractive hubbard model in a bipartite lattice ( for example , the honeycomb lattice and the square lattice ) , of which the hamiltonian is given by @xmath9 here , @xmath10 labels the lattice sites , and denote -sublattices and -sublattices , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are spin - indices , @xmath13 are hopping parameters between the sites on different sublattices , @xmath14 are hopping parameters between the site on same sublattices , @xmath15 is the strength of the attractive interaction , @xmath16 is the chemical potential , and @xmath17 is the strength of the zeeman field . in the following parts , we consider the case with @xmath18 , and set the lattice constant to be unity .",
    "let s discuss the global symmetry and the spontaneously symmetry breaking of the original hamiltonian in eq.([mod1 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.([mod1 ] ) has an particle - hole ( pseudo - spin ) symmetry group when @xmath18 , in which the group elements act on the space of the sf / cdw order parameters . to make the pseudo - spin symmetry more clear",
    ", we note that in terms of the canonical particle - hole transformation@xcite @xmath19 the original model is mapped onto a repulsive hubbard model with the effective chemical potential @xmath20 and effective zeeman field @xmath21 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 note that we have omitted the constant term @xmath24 with @xmath25 the total lattice sites number in hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "then , for the case of @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath18 , we can define an pseudo - spin symmetry of the hamiltonian in eq.([mod1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath28 by doing a pseudo - spin rotation @xmath29 with @xmath30 the pseudo - spin operators of the attractive hubbard model thus become @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 is the particle density operator , and the algebraic relation between the pseudo - spin operators is @xmath34 @xmath35=i\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma}\\hat{\\eta}^{\\gamma}$ ] . the ground state with @xmath36 or @xmath37",
    "is an sf state and the ground state with @xmath38 is a charge density wave ( cdw ) state .    for the generalized attractive hubbard model described by eq.([mod1 ] ) , with increasing the interaction strength",
    ", the ground state turns into a paired state . at the large-@xmath15 limit",
    ", such paired state has a large energy gap about @xmath15 . for above generalized attractive hubbard model with particle - hole ( pseudo - spin ) symmetry , by integrating out the hopping terms",
    ", we derive an effective pseudo - spin model with the super - exchange terms @xmath39 where the super - exchange coupling constants between different and same sublattices are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "one can see that @xmath42 is really a frustrated pseudo - spin model .",
    "for a conventional sf order with spontaneous phase symmetry breaking , there exists one goldstone mode with respect to the quantum phase fluctuation . in two dimensions , there exists a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition , below which the ( quasi ) long range phase coherence establishes .",
    "now we have an sf / cdw order with spontaneously pseudo - spin rotation symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , the quantum fluctuations around the mean field ground state are much stronger . in the cdw phase",
    ", one has a nonzero particle density modulation at different sublattices @xmath43 . according to the commutation relation between the phase @xmath44 of @xmath45 and the particle density operator @xmath46",
    ", i.e. , @xmath47\\neq0 $ ] , the nonzero particle density modulation leads to an uncertainty for the sf phase coherence and even destroys the long range sf phase coherence .",
    "thus , the non - zero value of @xmath48 only means the existence of cooper pairing . it does not necessarily imply that the ground state is a long range sf order . as a result",
    ", one needs to examine the stability of the sf order against quantum fluctuations based on a formulation by keeping pseudo - spin rotation symmetry .",
    "for the frustrated pseudo - spin model @xmath42 , the sf may possesses exotic quantum orders and also can not be described by landau s symmetry breaking theory .",
    "we call it qpl , of which the fermions are paired and single quasi - particle s excitation has a finite energy gap",
    ". however , we do nt have long range sf phase coherence and the sf order parameter is zero , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "thus in this region , the sf correlation decays exponentially @xmath50 .",
    "the particle number must be @xmath6 or @xmath7 on each site that correspond to doublon or holon , respectively .",
    "see the illustration in fig.(1 ) .    in this section , we are going to use the projective space construction(psg ) to construct quantum phase liquids by the @xmath51 slave - boson approach@xcite .",
    "the gauge structure here is just that of the quantum spin liquid . the pseudo - spin operator @xmath52 is now represented as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes pseudo spinon . in terms of the fermion operators the hamiltonian @xmath42 can be rewritten as@xmath55 with the constraints @xmath56 and @xmath57 such constraints",

    "similar to the quantum spin liquids , the mean field hamiltonian @xmath68 of qpl is invariant under a local @xmath51 transformation @xmath76@xcite : @xmath77 in particular , two mean - field ansatzs that have different @xmath78 and @xmath79 may be the same qpl by an @xmath1 gauge transformation . to understand the gauge fluctuations around the above mean - field state of a qpl",
    ", we may observe the non - trivial @xmath1 flux through plaquettes .",
    "these fluxes may break @xmath1 gauge structure down to @xmath2 or @xmath0 gauge structures and play the role of the higgs fields .",
    "thus we may characterize different quantum phase liquids by different psgs and different gauge structures as people understand the quantum spin liquids .",
    "now we consider the generalized attractive hubbard model with an external magnetic field , of which the hamiltonian becomes @xmath80 where the spatial variation of the phase @xmath81 can be interpreted as an effective _ aharonov - bohm _ phase induced by the external magnetic field . with the choice of the symmetric gauge",
    ", we can define the flux ratio @xmath82 with @xmath83 the magnetic flux through a plaquette , and @xmath84 the half of flux quantum .",

    "since quantum phase liquids with topological order are protected by the finite energy gaps of excitations , they are stable against arbitrary local perturbations@xcite . as a result , for the topological phase liquids , we can assume that the small external magnetic field will not change their mean field ansatz and the corresponding psg of the topological order .",
    "hence , for the topological phase liquids , since the mean - field hamiltonian of slave - particles in eq.([mean ] ) changes the original psg , it is not quite right . for this case , the external magnetic field will induce quantized vortices . in the topological phase liquids in a lattice ,",
