    "the behavior of polymer chains in random media is a well studied problem [ 1 - 6 ] that has applications in diverse fields . besides the polymers themselves this problem",
    "is directly related to the statistical mechanics of a quantum particle in a random potential @xcite , the behavior of flux lines in superconductors in the presence of columnar defects @xcite , and the problem of diffusion in a random catalytic environment @xcite . despite the volume of work that has been done on these problems there are still many unanswered questions . most of the previous work ( with the exception of directed polymers @xcite ) concentrated on disorder with short ranged correlations . in this paper",
    "we consider a model with long ranged ( quadratic ) correlations of the random potential that can serve as a laboratory ( toy model ) since it can be solved exactly using the replica method @xcite .",
    "since some people are somewhat wary of the @xmath6 limit used in replica calculations , we also solve the model numerically in one dimension and obtain an excellent agreement with the analytical solution .",
    "more importantly , the numerical solution enables us to explore the crossover from long ranged to short ranged correlations of the disorder and obtain a coherent picture of the behavior of a gaussian chain in a random medium .",
    "the simplest model of a polymer chain in random media is a gaussian ( flexible ) chain @xcite in a medium of fixed random obstacles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not include a self - avoiding interaction .",
    "this model can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the @xmath0 dimensional position vector of a point on the polymer at arc - length @xmath9 , and where @xmath3 is the contour length of the chain .",
    "the medium of random obstacles is described by a random potential @xmath10 that is taken from a gaussian distribution that satisfies @xmath11 the harmonic term in the hamiltonian is included to mimic the effects of finite volume .",
    "this is important to ensure that the model is well defined , since it turns out that certain equilibrium properties of the polymer diverge in the infinite volume limit @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath13 characterizes the correlations of the random potential , and will depend on the particular problem at hand .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is inversely proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and where @xmath17 is the khun bond step .",
    "once we have defined the hamiltonian for any chain configuration @xmath8 , we can write the partition sum ( green s function ) for the set of paths of length @xmath3 that go from @xmath18 to @xmath19 as @xmath20 { \\exp}(-\\beta h ) . \\label{z}\\ ] ] all the statistical properties of the polymer will depend on the partition sum .",
    "for instance , we can calculate the averaged mean squared displacement of the far end of a polymer with one end that is fixed at the origin .",
    "this is a measure of the wandering of a tethered polymer immersed in a random medium .",
    "this quantity can be written as @xmath21 where the overbar stands for the average of the ratio over the realizations of the random potential .",
    "this average is referred to as a quenched average , as opposed to an annealed average , where the numerator and denominator are averaged independently . for a polymer with one end",
    "fixed a typical conformation in a random medium is that of a tadpole .",
    "the head of the polymer wanders far from the origin to find a region of favorable potential and then the remaining chain settles itself in that region .",
    "this is at least what is believed to happen when the disorder has short ranged correlations @xcite . on the other hand if the chain is not anchored but both ends are free to move , the head to tail mean squared displacement is given by @xmath22 in this case the chain can move as a whole to find a favorable environment in the random medium .    in order to compute the quenched average over the random potential",
    "we apply the replica method .",
    "we first introduce @xmath23-copies of the system and average over the random potential to get @xmath24\\exp(-\\beta h_n ) , \\label{zn}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\int^l_0 du   \\int^l_0 du ' \\sum_{ab } f\\left ( ( { \\bf{r}}_a ( u)-{\\bf{r}}_b ( u'))^2 \\right ) . \\label{hn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the averaged equilibrium properties of the polymer can now be written in terms of the replicated partition sum @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , the mean squared displacement defined in eq .",
    "( [ rt2av ] ) can be written in as @xmath27 and similarly @xmath28 thus , the averaged equilibrium properties of the polymer can be extracted from an @xmath23-body problem by taking the @xmath29 limit at the end .",
    "this limit has to be taken with care , by solving the problem analytically for general @xmath23 , before taking the limit of @xmath30 .",
    "we now proceed to introduce our toy model that can be exactly solved using the replica method and which also lends itself to an accurate numerical solution .",
    "this is the case when a gaussian polymer chain is immersed in a random medium that has very long range spatial correlations .",
    "in particular , we take the correlation function to be of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is chosen to be larger than the sample size , so that the correlation function is well defined ( non - negative ) over the entire sample .",
    "since this model can be solved exactly using the replica method , we can compute all the important physical properties of the polymer chain , and then compare the exact analytical results with an alternative numerical solution ( at @xmath5 ) . also , this model of long range correlations is interesting in its own right in that it may serve as a good approximation to any correlation function @xmath13 that is smooth and slowly decaying .",
    "most cases investigated so far in the literature are concerned with disorder with short ranged correlations .",
    "there are many properties of the polymer chain that can be exactly computed .",
    "in addition to @xmath33 and @xmath34 we will compute two other quantities .",
    "first , for a polymer loop of arc - length @xmath3 , we will compute the quantity @xcite @xmath35 in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "this is a measure of the average fluctuations of a chain segment of arc - length @xmath37 . since in this case",
    "the chain is not anchored , this quantity is in some respect similar to @xmath38 . yet another quantity of interest is @xmath39 which has a more direct application to the related problem of a quantum particle in a random potential @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the partition sum of a polymer chain can be mapped to the density matrix of a quantum particle .",
    "the mapping @xcite is given by @xmath40 then @xmath41 is the density matrix of a quantum particle at inverse temperature @xmath42 .",
    "note that the variable @xmath43 is now interpreted as the trotter ( imaginary ) time , and @xmath14 as the mass of the quantum particle . under this mapping @xmath44 can be interpreted as the average mean squared displacement of a quantum particle in a random plus harmonic potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] we outline the exact analytical solution for various quantities relevant to a polymer chain . in the next section we present the details of the numerical approach to the problem . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we compare the analytical and numerical results and comment on the physical implications of our results . concluding remarks are offered in sec .",
    "we start with the case when one end point is fixed .",
    "the analytical calculation is based on an exact evaluation of the replicated partition sum ( [ zn ] ) . for the correlation function",

    "the result is @xmath57 which is independent of disorder and in the limit of @xmath58 behaves like @xmath59 , i.e. like a free chain .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 can also be computed exactly from the expression @xmath61 details are given in the appendix . however , in this case it is also possible to carry out the computation in an alternative way by taking advantage of the periodic boundary conditions of the closed loop .",
    "this provides for a further check on the result and is also included for instructional purposes .",

    "next , we compute the quantity @xmath73 .",
    "we find that @xmath74 which again implies that the deviation from the average @xmath75 is independent of disorder .    finally , we compute the quantity @xmath76 , which was defined in eq .",

    "we use , @xmath77 which for large @xmath3 yields the expression @xmath78 so we find that @xmath76 is independent of the disorder and is the same as that of a free chain .",
    "in order to check the validity of the analytical solution we will have to numerically compute the quenched average of certain physical properties of the polymer . this is a rather computationally intensive task because of the difficulty of evaluating the partition sum , and also because all quantities will then have to be averaged over many realizations of the random potential . in this paper",
    "we will only concentrate on the case @xmath5 .",
    "although this does not correspond to a physical polymer ( @xmath79 ) we will still be able to check the validity of our analytical results for the special case @xmath5 . in the context of the quantum particle in a random potential",

    "once these are known we can construct the partition sum at any value of @xmath3 using eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "the random potential @xmath92 is generated by first generating a gaussian correlated random potential @xmath93 that satisfies @xmath94 since we are making a lattice approximation we need a sequence of @xmath84 numbers @xmath95 that obey @xmath96 , where in this case @xmath97 .",

    "now , in order to generate quadratic correlations we choose @xmath32 such that the gaussian correlation function is well approximated by its leading quadratic term over the range of the system size .",

    "( [ shift2 ] ) . for small @xmath3",
    "there appears to be a discrepancy between the data and the analytical solution , whereas for larger @xmath3 the two curves are very close .",

    "thus for l shorter than 0.2 the particle can not see the random potential and @xmath114 vs. @xmath3 should average to zero .",

    "we can safely conclude that the replica calculation is indeed correct and does describe the averaged properties of the polymer .",
    "it is interesting to study the infinite volume limit @xmath115 . here",

    "also , eq .  ( [ smallmu ] ) indicates that for small @xmath3 the polymer wanders diffusively but for larger @xmath3 it wanders much faster than diffusion . in fig .",
    "[ small1 ] we plot @xmath120 vs. @xmath3 when @xmath121 is chosen to be very small . on the same graph we plot eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "8.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ samllmu3 ] we plot @xmath122 vs. @xmath3 . on the same graph",
    "we include the analytical prediction .",
    "8.5 cm    it is clear that the numerical results agree well with the analytical predictions . also , from eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) we see that the quantity @xmath123 diverges as @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that the boundary conditions on the chain are crucial in determining which quantities are well defined in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the physical consequences of our results are surprising and may seem counter intuitive at first glance .",
    "the very long range correlations of the random potential lead to a very fast wandering of the free end of a tethered chain .",
    "however , the deviation from the average position @xmath124 does not depend on the random potential . also , if both ends are free to move then the end to end distance @xmath125 behaves as if there is no random potential .",
    "this behavior can make more sense if we study the nature of the random potential samples that satisfy the quadratic correlation .",
    "we find that the typical random potential ( see fig .  [ rpot ] ) is smooth and slowly varying on short scales but contains peaks and valleys on scales close to the system size .",
    "8.5 cm    so as @xmath3 is increased the polymer has a greater tendency to be found in the deepest potential well in the sample , which , for large sample sizes , is on average located very far from the fixed end of the polymer .",
    "so for the case when one end is fixed we expect the end to end distance to grow very fast with @xmath3 , as the bulk ( center of mass ) of the polymer moves far away from the fixed end .",
    "this behavior is the same as in the case of short range correlations @xcite , where the polymer will typically form a tadpole conformation with the tail tethered to the origin and the head far away in some region of low potential .",
    "on the other hand , when both ends are free the entire polymer will simply curl up in the region of low potential and the end to end distance should depend only on the local behavior of the random potential .",
    "now , since the potential samples are smooth and slowly varying on short scales we do not expect the disorder to have much of an effect on the local behavior of the polymer .",
    "what is very interesting though is the fact that the chain that is free to move behaves as if the random potential has no effect at all .",
    "similarly , the fluctuations around the average position in the case when one end is fixed turn out to be totally independent of disorder .",
    "this is expected to be a special feature of the quadratically correlated random potential , and is not likely to hold in the general case of long range correlations .",
    "see discussion below about the crossover to shorter ranged correlations of the disorder .",
    "it is useful to compare our results with those for directed polymers . here",
    ", the arc - length @xmath43 corresponds to the distance along the directed axis which is a fixed direction in real space , and the vector @xmath8 is the position of the directed line in the transverse hyper - plane . in that case the random potential is usually taken to depend on @xmath43 and satisfy @xmath126 i. e. the random potential is taken to be uncorrelated along the directed axis , unlike the situation described in eqs .",
    "( [ ham],[vv ] ) were the random potential is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "parisi has shown @xcite that if @xmath13 is quadratic , then the mean squared displacement of one end of the directed polymer satisfies @xmath127 .",
    "this is to be compared with the @xmath119 dependence that we have found for the case when the random potential is independent of @xmath43 .    to explain the different scaling we employ a flory - type argument similar to the argument used in @xcite for directed polymers . allowing for a rescaling of the arc - length variable @xmath43 by a scale @xmath128 , i.e. @xmath129 and the position variables @xmath130",
    "we see that the random potential which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ vv ] ) with a correlation function behaving in general like @xmath131 scales like @xmath132 with @xmath133 the difference with directed polymers is that in that case one has to subtract a 1 from the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) because of the delta function in eq  ( [ dp ] ) .",
    "now in a flory argument one assumes that the two terms in the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) scale the same way ( here we consider only the case of @xmath134 , since @xmath135 breaks scale invariance ) .",
    "since the kinetic energy term scales like @xmath136 , and this should be equal to @xmath132 , we see that @xmath137 thus @xmath138 as opposed to @xmath139 for directed polymers . in the quadratic case @xmath140 , and we get the @xmath119 behavior we were looking for .",
    "notice that we derived here a prediction for the behavior of @xmath141 for the case of long ranged correlations of the disorder which are not quadratic but are characterized by a power law determined by the value of @xmath142 .",
    "thus the power of @xmath3 will decrease for shorter ranged correlations than quadratic .",
    "it is interesting to assess the accuracy of the flory argument in practice . in the function @xmath143 or in @xmath144",
    "the leading power of @xmath3 cancells out and one is left with a subleading @xmath145 behavior ( for quadratic correlations ) .    within this toy model",
    "it is interesting to compare the differences between the annealed and the quenched averages .",
    "the annealed average applies when the obstacles in the medium are randomly placed and mobile . in this case the replica trick is not necessary and the random potential can be averaged directly .",
    "alternatively one can use the results obtained with @xmath146 but instead of taking @xmath23 to 0 , substituting @xmath147 .",
    "we easily find that @xmath148 when @xmath3 is large , and where we have taken the @xmath58 limit .",
    "so in an annealed medium with long range quadratic correlations a very long polymer chain will collapse around the tethered end .",
    "similarly , we find that @xmath149 , and so if both ends are free then the polymer will collapse in the same way .",
    "this behavior is in stark contrast to the quenched case where the effects of the random medium is quite different",
    ".    for the case of short ranged correlations and a chain that is free to move one usually argues @xcite that the annealed and quenched averages coincide in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this is due to the fact that the system can be divided into subregions , much larger than the chain , each containing a different realization of the potential .",
    "the moving chain can sample all of these and find a realization very similar to the one it induces around itself in the annealed case .",
    "but this argument does not apply to the case of long ranged correlations of the random potential , with the correlation length larger than the system size , since such a division to subregions will not yield independent realizations .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate how the physical properties that we have found change as we move towards the regime of short range correlations . in our model we can control the correlation length by varying the parameter @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ gaussiancor ] ) i.e. in the gaussian form . for small @xmath32",
    "the correlation is certainly not quadratic , and it approaches a @xmath150-function in the limit @xmath151 . for arbitrary @xmath32 we expect that the average mean displacement squared in @xmath5 will scale as @xmath152 .",

    "[ s3 ] was unreliable .",
    "the reason for this is that the sum over energy eigenfunctions in eq .",
