    "nanostructure technology allows for the fabrication of small structures , such as quantum dots @xcite , nanowires @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , as well as molecular structures , whose electronic properties are dominated by a small number of electrons .",
    "the insertion into electrical circuits exhibits current - bias ( @xmath0 ) relations , which strongly differ from conventional resistors .",
    "typical features are the suppression of current for low bias due to coulomb blockade and pronounced current steps , whose position can be easily controlled by a gate bias , thus suggesting transistor action .    due to the small spatial dimensions , the level quantisation with a spacing @xmath1 is of fundamental relevance .",
    "further relevant energy scales are : the coulomb interaction between electrons ( or similarly any other type of many - particle interaction @xcite ) of the order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the geometrical capacitance ; the tunneling rate @xmath4 for the transition of particles between the structure and the contacts ; as well as the thermal energy @xmath5 . for typical nanostructured electronic systems studied experimentally , these energies are all in the range of 0.110 mev , where @xmath6 can be even smaller . generic examples of @xmath0-characteristics are shown in fig .  [ figoverwiew ] .",
    "the task to describe the current through such structures quantitatively is an evolved topic and a large variety of approaches has been used within the last two decades .",
    "the general starting point is to divide the hamiltonian of the system as @xmath7 here @xmath8 describes the central region ( such as a single or multiple quantum dot structure , a molecule , a carbon nanotube , or a nanowire ) , which we refer to as the quantum dot in the following .",

    "conventionally noninteracting leads are assumed .",
    "finally , @xmath17 describes the coupling between the leads and the quantum dot .    if @xmath8 does not contain many - particle interactions , it is straightforward to derive a transmission formula ( see @xcite and references therein ) yielding a particle current from lead @xmath12 into the quantum dot @xmath18 . \\label{eqtransmission}\\ ] ] here the transmission function is determined by the single - particle spectrum of @xmath8 in connection with the coupling @xmath17 , which essentially broaden the levels .",
    "a formal tool is the nonequilibrium green function formalism @xcite .",
    "an inclusion of many - particle effects within the mean - field level is straightforward and exchange - correlation effects can be taken into account by more involved mean - field potentials @xcite .",
    "also time - dependent simulations are possible using time - dependent density functional theory @xcite . however , hardly any results exist , which go beyond mean - field ( a rather old example is @xcite )",
    ". thus this approach works for arbitrary temperatures if correlation effects due to the coulomb interaction in the system are small .",
    "another approach is to start from the von - neumann equation @xmath19 \\label{eqvn}\\ ] ] treating the time evolution of the density operator @xmath20 containing both the system and the leads .",
    "as only the time - evolution of the system is of interest , one can trace - out the lead degree of freedom in order to obtain the reduced dot density operator @xmath21 the key task is to find an approximate equation of motion for @xmath22 taking into account the coupling @xmath17 .",

    "one obtains to lowest order the pauli master equations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , coherences , represented by nondiagonal matrix elements , can be treated in different ways ( frequently also denoted quantum master equations ) .",
    "the traditional approach is the wangness - bloch redfield kinetics @xcite which has been applied to quantum dots in @xcite .",
    "while reasonable results are typically found , there is a fundamental problem due to the occurrence of negative occupations as the equations are not of lindblad type @xcite .",
    "lindblad - type kinetic equations were derived in @xcite , but only for the high - bias limit .",
    "all first - order approaches entirely neglect broadening effects but can treat the interactions in the system exactly by a diagonalization of the isolated dot hamiltonian @xcite @xmath23 where the states @xmath24 are many - particle states , which may be highly correlated .    in order to treat both broadening and interaction , we introduced a second order approach based on the von neumann equation ( [ eqvn ] ) which considers both the dynamics of @xmath22 and higher - order tunneling transitions @xcite .",
    "this second order von neumann approach ( 2vn ) bridges the gap between the transmission formalism , which is fully reproduced for systems without interactions at arbitrary temperatures , and the first order generalized master equation schemes , which are recovered in the limits of high temperature or large bias .    in this paper",
