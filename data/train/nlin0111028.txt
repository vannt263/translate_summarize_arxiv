    "the biological evolution theory of darwin is well known to all .",
    "the biological evolution can be divided into two different types , micro - evolution and macro - evolution , which focus on the dynamics of evolution at the level of a single population and of all species in ecosystem respectively . up to now , many scaling laws have been found in macroevolutionary data . the distribution @xmath6 of extinction sizes for families @xmath7 decreases with @xmath7 according to a power - law : @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath9 of genera lifetimes @xmath10 follows @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the distribution of the number of genera @xmath12 with @xmath13 species can be fitted with @xmath14 @xcite . the disappearance of species or genera is similar to radioactive decay , in which the amount of the  original element  decays exponentially with time .",
    "this phenomenon has been named as red queen effect@xcite .",
    "the extinction events exhibit punctuated patterns@xcite .",
    "the punctuated equilibrium can be interpreted as a metastable state of the dynamics of that single species@xcite .",
    "if an ecosystem is in equilibrium , every species is stable .",
    "however , if one of them fluctuates with time , it will lead to the destabilization of its neighboring species .",
    "thus , the avalanche fluctuation will sweep through the evolution .",
    "the existence of scaling laws in macro - evolution indicates that the dynamics of large - scale evolution is the result of a self - organized critical process@xcite .",
    "based upon this view , bak and sneppen introduced a toy model for species evolution@xcite .",
    "it is defined and simulated as follows : ( i ) @xmath15 species are arranged on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "( ii ) random numbers @xmath16 , which are chosen from a uniform distribution between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , are independently assigned to each site ( species ) .",
    "( iii ) at each time step , the extremal site , i.e. , the one with the smallest random number @xmath20 , and its nearest neighbors are mutated by assigning new random numbers in @xmath21 .",
    "as the system evolves it turns out that the species with fitness significantly above the self - organized threshold @xmath22 ( equal to @xmath23@xcite ) will never mutate , unless its neighbors mutate .",
    "after enough mutations have occurred , the ecosystem reaches a statistically stationary state in which the distribution for the fitness of all species is statistically stationary .",
    "since the bak - sneppen model was defined , its punctuated patterns and avalanche dynamics have been investigated extensively . through observing the fluctuations of the smallest fitness ,",
    "the model shows punctuated equilibrium behavior , i.e. , it self - organizes into a critical state with intermittent coevolutionary avalanches of all size@xcite .",
    "paczuski , maslov and bak studied the @xmath24 avalanche ( pmb avalanche ) , forward avalanche and backward avalanche and derived the exact scaling equations , they also established the relations among the critical exponents@xcite . recently , by monitoring the variations of the average fitness , the @xmath25 avalanche ( lc avalanche ) , is found , and the exact equations and scaling relations are obtained@xcite . as we know , the avalanche dynamics is a kind of macroscopic phenomenon in driven dissipative systems .",
    "the detailed dynamics of these systems sensitively depend on the initial configurations .",
    "but the distribution of avalanches , i.e. , scaling law , does not depend on such details due to the universality of complexity@xcite . in the existing works , analyzing the smallest fitness only directly connects with the feature of individuals , but it does not directly represent the global feature ; discussing the average fitness only directly connects with the global dynamics , but it does not directly manifest the difference in individuals . can we find a new quantity , which can describe the global feature and the individual difference simultaneously ? in this paper , we define such a quantity and observe the corresponding avalanche dynamics with this quantity .    in the next section , the standard distribution width of fitness is defined , and its gap equation is obtained . in sec .",
    "iii , the dynamics of avalanche is analyzed in detail , the exact mast equation is derived , and the scaling relations are established among the critical exponents . the last section is a brief summary .",
    "in the bak - sneppen model , the fitness of the @xmath26-th species is denote as @xmath27 @xmath28 , with @xmath15 being the total number of species .",
    "the fitness represents the population or the living capability of the species , large fitness means immense population or great living capability , and vice versa . to describe the average population or average living capability of an ecosystem , li and cai defined the average fitness as@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fitness of the @xmath26-th species at time @xmath31 . based upon the average fitness",
    ", we define the standard distribution width of fitness as @xmath32 from the above definition , we know that the standard distribution width of fitness simultaneously manifests both global dynamics and individual difference . at the beginning of the evolution , i.e. , @xmath33 , the fitnesses are uniformly distributed in @xmath34 .",
    "thus for an infinite - size ecosystem @xmath35 , the initial average fitness @xmath36 equals @xmath37 , the initial standard distribution width @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "but for a finite - size ecosystem , @xmath36 and @xmath38 fluctuate around the above values due to the finite size . because of the absence of mutations or updates , @xmath38 does not show the correlation between species , only when the evolution goes on , such correlation is contained in @xmath40 gradually .    as time increases",
    ", @xmath41 shows an increasing tendency@xcite , whereas , @xmath40 shows a decreasing tendency ( see the bottom of fig .",
    "1 ) . after a long transience",
    ", i.e. , @xmath42 , the ecosystem self - organizes to a critical state , and , @xmath41 and @xmath40 approach to different thresholds .",
    "when @xmath43 , almost all species have fitnesses above the threshold @xmath44@xcite , and the fitnesses are uniformly distributed in @xmath45 . with the definitions of @xmath41 and @xmath40 , we obtain the relation among the thresholds @xmath46 here , @xmath1 and @xmath47 are thresholds of @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "thus , one gets @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for the finite - size ecosystem",
    ", the self - organized critical thresholds will fluctuate around the above values , and this fluctuation decreases with the increase of @xmath15 .",
    "similar to the definition in refs.@xcite , we define the gap of @xmath40 as its envelope : @xmath50 ) & , & s>0 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the above definition means that the current gap of @xmath40 is the most minimum of all @xmath51 @xmath52 . in the top of fig . 1",
    ", we show the gap @xmath53 as a function of @xmath31 . with the increase of time ,",
    "@xmath54 gradually approaches close to the threshold . by definition ,",
    "when the gap falls to its next lower value , the separate instances are separated by avalanches .",
    "the avalanches correspond to plateaus in @xmath53 during which @xmath55 .",
    "a new avalanche is initiated when the gap falls , and the old avalanche terminates at the same time .",
    "once a avalanche is over it will never affect the behavior of any subsequent avalanche .",
    "when the gap decreases , the probability for @xmath40 to jump above @xmath53 increases , thus longer and longer avalanches happen typically . finally , the ecosystem falls into statistically stationary state .",
    "following refs.@xcite , we derive the gap equation of @xmath53 .",
    "if the gap is changed from @xmath53 to @xmath56 , the average number of avalanches occurred is @xmath57 .",
    "thus , when @xmath58 , the average number of time steps required for increasing the gap from @xmath53 to @xmath56 is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the average size of avalanche of the current plateau of the gap .",
    "so the differential equation for @xmath53 is @xmath61 eq.(5 ) describes the relaxation to attractor .",
    "if the law of @xmath62 is obtained , one can derive the law of relaxation to attractor from the above equation .",
    "we know that all self - organized critical systems will exhibit a power - law avalanche dynamics .",
    "this has been confirmed by a lot of models with self - organized criticality@xcite . in this section ,",
    "based on the definition of pmb avalanche@xcite and lc avalanche@xcite , the definition of a new avalanche , @xmath63avalanche , is presented .",
    "then its critical exponents are calculated with numerical simulation and its exact master equation is derived .",
    "lastly , the scaling relations are established .",
    "the definition for @xmath63avalanche is as follows .",
    "similar to those used in refs.@xcite , we introduce an auxiliary parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath64 .",
    "suppose that at time step @xmath65 , the current standard distribution width @xmath66 is less than @xmath0 . if the next standard distribution width @xmath67 is larger than @xmath0 , a creation - annihilation branching process is initiated .",
    "the avalanche will continue to run unless @xmath40 becomes less than @xmath0 .",
    "this means that , at time @xmath31 , if all @xmath68 for @xmath69 , the current avalanche continues . in terms of the above definition ,",
    "the size of an avalanche is the number of time steps of subsequent punctuations above @xmath70 .",
    "if the first appearance of @xmath71 after time @xmath65 occurs at time @xmath72 , the size of the current avalanche is @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , the above definition ensures the hierarchical structure , i.e. , larger avalanches consist of smaller ones . with the decreasing of @xmath0 ,",
    "smaller avalanches combine into larger ones ; if @xmath0 is set as @xmath1 , the infinite - size avalanche appears . in the other case , with the increasing of @xmath0 , larger avalanches split into smaller ones .",
    "thus , the cutoff effects is unavoidable when @xmath0 is not chosen as @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the same scaling laws can be obtained when @xmath0 is very close to the threshold @xmath1 . for the bak - sneppen model with @xmath74 species , choosing @xmath70 as @xmath75",
    ", we find by numerical simulation that the distribution of avalanche size follows the power law @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the probability of avalanche of size @xmath73 , @xmath78 equals @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "because of the cutoff effects , the average avalanche size varies when @xmath0 changes .",
    "similar to those in refs.@xcite , our numerical results show that the average size of @xmath0 avalanche obeys @xmath80 here , @xmath1 is the threshold , the exponent @xmath5 equals @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "this law means that the divergence of the average avalanche size satisfies power law .",
    "our numerical simulation also shows that the relaxation to attractor abides @xmath82 here , @xmath31 is the time steps , the exponent @xmath4 equals @xmath83 .",
    "obviously , the value of @xmath4 is very close to @xmath84 .",
    "so far , we have found some scaling laws of the @xmath63avalanche by numerically simulations .",
    "now , we will give some exact results . to describe the cascade process of smaller avalanches combining into larger ones",
    "when the parameter @xmath0 is changed , an exact master equation is derived as follows . denoting the probability of @xmath63avalanche of size @xmath73 as @xmath85 ,",
    "when parameter changes from @xmath0 into @xmath86 , some @xmath63avalanches merge to larger @xmath86 avalanches , and some small avalanches merge into @xmath63avalanche .",
    "thus , at the same time , the probability of a avalanche with a given size flows in and out . because the termination of @xmath63avalanche is uncorrelated , the probability of a @xmath63avalanche merging to @xmath87 avalanche is proportional to @xmath88@xcite .",
    "thus the probability which flows out from @xmath85 can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a constant .",
    "the probability which flows in @xmath85 is @xmath91 when @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 and @xmath92 approaches zero , we obtain the following master equation @xmath93 as pointed out in the previous section , with the increasing of time , the standard distribution width shows a decreasing tendency .",
    "so , when @xmath0 decreases , the first term on the right side of the master equation reflects the loss of @xmath73-size avalanche , and the second term depicts the gain of @xmath73-size avalanche .",
    "similar to ref.@xcite , after defining a new variable @xmath94 , the master equation becomes @xmath95 through performing a laplacian transformation for @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath97 thus the master equation reads as @xmath98.\\ ] ] when @xmath99 , @xmath100 , this is the normalization of @xmath96 . while @xmath101 , one gets @xmath102 . expanding both sides of eq.(14 ) as taylor series throughout the neighborhood of the point @xmath99",
    ", one can obtain @xmath103   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\lambda [ 1-\\alpha \\left\\langle s\\right\\rangle _ { u}+\\frac{1}{2!}\\alpha ^{2}\\left\\langle s^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { u}-\\frac{1}{3!}\\alpha ^{3}\\left\\langle s^{3}\\right\\rangle _ { u}\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot ]",

    "the first exact equations can be expressed as @xmath106 replacing @xmath107 as @xmath108 , we obtain the @xmath5 equation @xmath109 noting the scaling law @xmath110 , inserting it into the above equation , one can easily gain @xmath111    by far , we have obtained three critical exponents of the @xmath0 avalanche : @xmath112 , @xmath3and @xmath4 , which describe the behavior of the avalanche size distribution , the average avalanche size , and the relaxation to attractor , respectively . as listed in ref.@xcite",
    ", there are three other critical exponents : @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the avalanche dimension @xmath116 is defined by the following scaling relation @xmath117 where @xmath73 is the avalanche size ( temporal duration ) , @xmath118 is the spatial extent .",
    "the @xmath114 and @xmath115 are defined by the following scaling laws of cutoff @xmath119 @xmath120 the symbols @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the cutoff of the avalanche size and that of spatial extent of the avalanche .",
    "although there are six critical exponents , only part of them are independent . after choosing @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath5 as the independent exponents , the other ones can be expressed as functions of them . inserting the scaling law @xmath110 into the gap equation ( eq.(5 ) ) , and noting the scaling law @xmath123 , one can find @xmath124 integrating the equation @xmath125 , it is easy to obtain @xmath126 comparing with @xmath110 , one can get @xmath127 noting that the average number of the covered sites @xmath128 covered by a @xmath0 avalanche scales near the critical point as@xcite @xmath129and @xmath130 , so @xmath131 , integrating the equation @xmath132 gives @xmath133 thus , the avalanche dimension @xmath113 can be written as @xmath134 noting @xmath135 and @xmath136 , one can immediately obtain @xmath137 comparing with @xmath138 , it is easy to know @xmath139 up to now , the scaling relations among the six critical exponents have been successfully established .",
    "the existence of two independent critical exponents means that there are two kinds uncorrelated critical behavior in @xmath70 avalanche .",
    "in conclusion , by defining a new quantity , the standard distribution width of fitness , a new avalanche , @xmath0 avalanche , is observed in the evolution of bak - sneppen model .",
    "we declare this avalanche as a different hierarchy of avalanche , because firstly , the observed quantity is different from those of refs.@xcite and refs.@xcite ; and secondly , the values of the critical exponents are also different from those found in refs.@xcite and refs.@xcite .    from the definition of the standard distribution width of fitness , we easily obtain the corresponding gap equation and the self - organized threshold .",
    "apparently , with this definition , the global feature and the difference among individuals are simultaneously described by the standard distribution width .",
    "so , for the evolutionary distribution with changeless or small changed average values , the standard distribution width is a good quantity to observe the evolutionary dynamics . according to the definition of pmb avalanche and lc avalanche ,",
    "the definition of the @xmath0 avalanche is presented . with numerical simulation ,",
    "the critical exponents @xmath78 , @xmath140and @xmath4 are obtained .",
    "then the exact master equation is derived . from the master equation ,",
    "the @xmath5 equation is immediately obtained .",
    "finally , combining all scaling laws , the scaling relations are successfully established among the critical exponents . with these relations",
    ", we find there are only two uncorrelated critical behavior in the @xmath0 avalanche , for there exist only two independent critical exponents .",
