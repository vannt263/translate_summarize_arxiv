    "many people who have studied quantum field theory find the most difficult part is the theory of renormalization .",
    "the relativistic field theory is full of infinities which need to be taken care of before the theoretical predictions can be compared with experimental measurements .",
    "these infinities look formidable at first sight .",
    "it is remarkable that over the years a way has been found to make sense of these apparently divergent theories ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the theory of renormalization is a prescription which consistently isolates and removes all these infinities from the physically measurable quantities .",
    "note that the need for renomalization is quite general and is not unique to the relativistic field theory .",
    "for example , consider an electron moving inside a solid .",
    "if the interaction between electron and the lattice of the solid is weak enough , we can use an effective mass @xmath0 to describe its response to an externally applied force and this effective mass is certainly different from the mass @xmath1 measured outside the solid .",
    "thus the electron mass is changed ( renormalized ) from @xmath1 to @xmath0 by the interaction of the electron with the lattice in the solid . in this simple case ,",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are measurable and hence finite . for the relativistic field theory ,",
    "the situation is the same except for two important differences .",
    "first the renormalization due to the interaction is generally infinite ( corresponding to the divergent loop diagrams ) .",
    "these infinities , coming from the contribution of high momentum modes are present even for the cases where the interactions are weak .",
    "second , there is no way to switch off the interaction between particles and the quantities in the absence of interaction , bare quantities , are not measurable . roughly speaking ,",
    "the program of removing the infinities from physically measurable quantities in relativistic field theory , the renormalization program , involves shuffling all the divergences into bare quantities . in other words",
    ", we can redefine the unmeasurable quantities to absorb the divergences so that the physically measurable quantities are finite .",
    "the renormalized mass which is now finite can only be determined from experimental measurement and can not be predicted from the theory alone .",
    "eventhough the concept of renormalization is quite simple , the actual procedure for carrying out the operation is quite complicated and intimidating . in this article",
    ", we will give a bare bone of this program and refer interested readers to more advanced literature ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "note that we need to use some regularization procedure ( @xcite ) to make these divergent quantities finite before we can do mathematically meaningful manipulations .",
    "we will not discuss this part in the short presentation here . also note that not every relativistic field theory will have this property that all divergences can be absorbed into redefinition of few physical parameters .",
    "those which have this property are called @xmath2 theories and those which do nt are called unrenormalizable theories .",
    "this has became an important criteria for choosing a right theory because we do not really know how to handle the @xmath3 theory .",
    "there are two different methods to carry out the renormalization program , i ) conventional renormalization which is more intuitive but mathematically complicated , ii ) bph renormalization which is simple to describe but not so transparent ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two methods are in fact complementary to each other and it is very useful to know both .",
    "we will illustrate this scheme in the simple @xmath4 theory where the lagrangian can be written as@xmath5 with@xmath6\\ ] ] and@xmath7 here @xmath8  , @xmath9 are bare mass , bare coupling constant and bare field respectively .",
    "the propagator and vertex of this theory are given below ,     + fig 1 feynman rule for @xmath10 theory    here @xmath11 is the momentum carried by the line and @xmath12 is the bare mass term in @xmath13    the two point function ( propagator ) defined by@xmath14 can be written in terms of one - particle - irreducible , or 1pi ( those graphs which can not be made disconnected by cutting any one internal line ) as a geometric series@xmath15 here @xmath16 is the ipi self energy graph . in one - loop ,",

    "one important feature to note about these integrals is that when we differentiate them with respect to external momenta , the integral will become more convergent .",
    "for example , if we differentiate @xmath22 with respect to @xmath23 , one finds@xmath24 ^{2}}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is finite .",
    "this means that the divergences will reside only in the first few terms in a taylor expansion in the external momenta of the feynman diagram . in our case",
    ", we can write@xmath25 where @xmath26 is logarithmic divergent and @xmath27 which is the sum of all higher derivative terms , is finite . in other words , the finite part @xmath28 corresponds to subtracting the divergent part @xmath29 from @xmath21 and is sometimes referred to as the @xmath30 .",
    "the self energy contribution in eq ( [ self - energy ] ) is quadratically divergent . to isolate the divergences we use the taylor expansion around some arbitrary value @xmath31@xmath32 where @xmath33 is quadratically divergent , and @xmath34 is logarithmically divergent and @xmath35 is finite .",
    "the finite part @xmath35 will have the property,@xmath36 note that self - energy in 1-loop has the peculiar feature that it is independent of the external momentum @xmath23 and the taylor expansion has only one term , @xmath37 however , the higher loop contribution does depend on the external momentum and the taylor expansion is non - trivial .",
    "the propagator in eq ( [ propagator ] ) is then,@xmath38 the physical mass is defined as the position of the pole in the propagator . since up to this point",
    "@xmath39 is arbitrary , we can choose it to satisfy the relation,@xmath40 then @xmath41   -\\widetilde{\\sigma}\\left ( p^{2}\\right )   + i\\varepsilon}%\\ ] ] and using eq ( [ finite - part ] ) we see that @xmath42 has a pole at @xmath43 thus @xmath39 is the * physical mass * and is related to the bare mass @xmath12 in eq ( [ mass - renormalization ] ) .",
    "this is the @xmath44 @xmath45 since @xmath33 is divergent , the bare mass @xmath12 must also be divergent so that the combination @xmath46 is finite and measurable . in other words , the bare mass @xmath12 has to diverge in such a way that its divergence cancels the divergent loop correction to yield a finite result .",
    "it amounts to shuffling the infinities to unobservable quantities like bare mass @xmath47 this is the part in renormalization theory which is very difficult to comprehend at the first sight .",
    "nevertheless it is logically consistent and the rules are very precise . furthermore , the results after the renomalization have been successfully checked by experiments .",
    "this gives us confidence about the validity of renormalization theory .    to remove the divergent quantity @xmath34 we note that in 1-loop both @xmath48 are of order @xmath49 for convenience",
    ", we can make the approximation,@xmath50   \\widetilde{\\sigma}\\left (   p^{2}\\right )   + o\\left ( \\lambda_{0}^{2}\\right)\\ ] ] and write the propagator as@xmath51",

    "one important feature to keep in mind is that in carrying out the renormalization program there is an arbitrariness in choosing the points for the taylor expansion .",
    "different renormalization schemes seem to give rise to different looking relations .",
    "however , if these renormalization schemes make any sense at all , the physical laws which are relations among physically measurable quantities should be the same regardless of which scheme is used .",
    "this is the basic idea behind the @xmath58 @xmath79 @xmath80 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the basic coupling in @xmath4 theory is the 4-point function which in 1-loop has the form , before renormalization,@xmath81 where last three terms are logarithmic divergent .",
    "we will remove these divergences by the redefinition of the coupling constant .",

    "the bph renormalization scheme looks very simple .",
    "it is remarkable that this simple scheme can serve as the basis for setting up a proof for a certain class of field theory .",
    "there are many interesting and useful features in bph which do not show themselves on the first glance and are very useful in the understanding of this renormalization program .",
    "we will now discuss some of them .    1 .   in our analysis",
    "so far , we have used the superficial degree of divergences @xmath158 .",
    "it is clear that to 1-loop order that superficial degree of divergence is the same as the real degree of divergence .",
    "when we go beyond 1-loop it is possible to have an overall @xmath159 while there are real divergences in the subgraphs .",
    "the real convergence of a feynman graph is governed by weinberg s theorem ( @xcite ) : the general feynman integral converges if the superficial degree of divergence of the graph together with the superficial degree of divergence of all subgraphs are negative . to be more explicit ,",

    "let @xmath165 be the superficial degree of divergence associated with integration over this set , i. e.,@xmath166 where @xmath167 is some function of @xmath168 then the convergent theorem states that the integral over @xmath164 converges if the @xmath169 for all possible choice of @xmath170 are negative .",
    "for example the graph in the following figure +   + fig 7 divergence in 6-point function + is a 6-point function with @xmath171 but the integration inside the box with @xmath172 is logarithmically divergent .",

    "+   + fig 8 counterterm for 6-point function 2 .",
    "it is useful to distinguish divergent graphs with different topologies in the construction of counterterms . 1 .",
    "a primitively divergent graph has a nonnegative overall superficial degree of divergence but is convergent for all subintegrations .",
    "thus these are diagrams in which the only divergences is caused by all of the loop momenta growing large together .",
    "this means that when we differentiate with respect to external momenta at least one of the internal loop momenta will have more power in the denominator and will improve the convergence of the diagram .",
    "it is then clear that all the divergences can be isolated in the first few terms of the taylor expansion .",
    "the divergent subgraphs are disjointed .  for illustration ,",
    "consider the 2-loop graph given below , +   + fig 9 two - loop disjoint divergence + it is clear that differentiating with respect to the external momentum will improve only one of the loop integration but not both . as a result ,",
    "not all divergences in this diagram can be removed by subtracting out the first few terms in the taylor expansion around external momenta . however , the lower order counter terms in the bph scheme will come in to save the day .",

    "however , we have the lower order counterm @xmath178 corresponding to the substraction introduced at the 1-loop level .",
    "this generates the additional contributions given in the following diagrams , +   + fig 10 two - loop graphs with counterms + which are proportional to @xmath179 adding these 3 contributions , we get@xmath180   ^{2}-2\\lambda^{3}% \\gamma\\left (   0\\right )   \\gamma\\left (   p\\right ) \\\\ &   = \\lambda^{3}\\left [   \\gamma\\left (   p\\right )   -\\gamma\\left (   0\\right ) \\right ]   ^{2}-\\lambda^{3}\\left [   \\gamma\\left (   0\\right )   \\right ]   ^{2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the combination in the first @xmath181   $ ] is finite , the divergence in the last term can be removed by one differentiation . here",
    "we see that with the inclusion of lower order counterterms , the divergences take the form of polynomials in external momenta .",
    "thus for graphs with disjointed divergences we need to include the lower order counter terms to remove the divergences by substractions in taylor expansion .",
    "3 .   in this case",
    "one of a pair of divergent 1pi is entirely contained within the other as shown in the following diagram , +   + fig 11 nested divergences + after the subgraph divergence is removed by diagrams with lower order counterterms , the overall divergences is then renormalized by a @xmath182 counter terms as shown below , +   + fig 12 lower order counterterm + again diagrams with lower - order counterterm insertions must be included in order to aggregate the divergences into the form of polynomial in external momenta .",
    "4 .   these diagrams are those divergences which are neither nested nor disjointed .",
    "these are most difficult to analyze .",

    "there is only one type of theory in this category , namely @xmath210 interaction .",
    "@xmath211here @xmath135 is independent of the number of i - th type of vertices and interactions are called @xmath2 @xmath212 .",
    "the divergence are present in all higher - order diagrams of a finite number of green s functions .",
    "interactions in this category are of the form , @xmath213 @xmath214 3 .",
    "@xmath215then @xmath135 increases with the number of the i - th type of vertices and all green s functions are divergent for large enough @xmath216 these are called @xmath217 @xmath218 there are plenty of examples in this category , @xmath219",
    "@xmath220 @xmath221    the index of divergence @xmath222 can be related to the operator s @xmath223 @xmath224 which is defined in terms of the high energy behavior in the free field theory .",
    "more specifically , for any operator @xmath225 we write the 2-point function as@xmath226 if the asymptotic behavior is of the form,@xmath227 then the canonical dimension is defined as@xmath228 thus for the case of fermion and scalar fields we have,@xmath229@xmath230 note that in these simple cases , these values are the same as those obtained in the dimensional analysis in the classical theory and sometimes they are also called the naive dimensions . as we will see later for the vector field , the canonical dimension is not necessarily the same as the naive dimension .    for composite operators that are polynomials in the scalar or fermion fields",
    "it is difficult to know their asymptotic behavior .",
    "so we define their canonical dimensions as the algebraic sum of their constituent fields .",
    "for example , @xmath231 for general composite operators that show up in the those interaction described before , we have,@xmath232 and it is related to the index of divergence as@xmath233 we see that a dimension 4 interaction is renormalizable and greater than 4 is non - renormalizable .",
    "recall that we add counterterms to cancel all the divergences in green s functions with superficial degree of divergences @xmath234 for convenience we use the taylor expansion around zero external momenta @xmath235 it is easy to see that a general diagram with @xmath236 counter terms will be of the form@xmath237 and the canonical dimension is@xmath238 the index of divergence of the counterterms is@xmath239 using the relation in eq ( [ superd ] ) we can write this as@xmath240 since @xmath241 , we have the result@xmath242 thus , the counterterms induced by a feynman diagrams have indices of divergences less or equal to the sum of the indices of divergences of all interactions @xmath222 in the diagram .",
    "we then get the general result that the renormalizable interactions which have @xmath211 will generate counterterms with @xmath243 thus if all the @xmath244 terms are present in the original lagrangain , so that the counter terms have the same structure as the interactions in the original lagragian , they may be considered as redefining parameters like masses and coupling constants in the theory . on the other hand",
    "non - renormalizable interactions which have @xmath215 will generate counterterms with arbitrary large @xmath245 in sufficiently high orders and clearly can not be absorbed into the original lagrangian by a redefinition of parameters @xmath246 thus non - renormalizable theories will not necessarily be infinite ; however the infinite number of counterterms associated with a non - renormalizable interaction will make it lack in predictive power and hence be unattractive , in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "we will adopt a more restricted definition of renormalizability : a lagrangian is said to be renormalizable by power counting if all the counterterms induced by the renormalization procedure can be absorbed by redefinitions of parameters in the lagrangian . with this definition the theory with yukawa interaction @xmath247 by itself , is not renormalizable even though the coupling constant is dimensionless .",
    "this is because the 1-loop diagram shown below      is logarithmically divergent and needs a counter term of the form @xmath248 which is not present in the original lagrangain .",
    "thus yukawa interaction with additional @xmath248 interaction is renormalizable .      1 .",
    "massless vector field is usually associated with local gauge invariance as in the case of qed .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of free field propagator for such vector field is very similar to that of scalar field .",
    "for example , in the feynman gauge we have@xmath249 which has the same asymptotic behaior as that of scalar field .",
    "thus the power counting for theories with massless vector field interacting with fermions and scalar fields is the same as before .",
    "the renomalizable interactions in this category are of the type,@xmath250 here @xmath251 is a massless vector field and @xmath183 a fermion field .",
    "the free lagrangian is of the form,@xmath252 where @xmath253 is a massive vector field and @xmath254 is the mass of the vector field .",
    "the propagator in momentum space is of the form,@xmath255 this implies that canonical dimension of massive vector field is two rather than one .",
    "the power counting is now modified with superficial degree of divergence given by@xmath256 with@xmath257 here @xmath258 is the number of external vector lines , @xmath259 is the number of vector fields in the @xmath260th type of vertex and @xmath261 is the canonical dimension of the interaction term in @xmath200 . from the formula for @xmath261",
    "we see that the only renormalizable interaction involving massive vector field , @xmath262 is of the form , @xmath263 and is not lorentz invariant .",
    "thus there is no nontrivial interaction of the massive vector field which is renormalizabel .",
    "however , two important exceptions should be noted ; 1 .   in a gauge theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking ,",
    "the gauge boson will acquire mass in such a way to preserve the renormalizability of the theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   a theory with a neutral massive vector boson coupled to a conserved current is also renormalizable .",
    "heuristically , we can understand this as follows .",
    "the propagator in eq([massive v ] ) always appears between conserved currents @xmath264 and @xmath265 and the @xmath266 term will not contribute because of current conservation , @xmath267 or in the coordinate space @xmath268 then the power counting is essentially the same as for the massless vector field case .      in some cases , we need to consider the green s function of composite operator , an operator with more than one fields at the same space time .",
    "consider a simple composite operator of the form @xmath269 in @xmath10 theory .",
    "green s function with one insertion of @xmath270 is of the form , @xmath271 in momentum space we have @xmath272 in perturbation theory , we can use wick s theorem ( @xcite ) to work out these green s functions in terms of feynman diagram.example , to lowest order in @xmath87 the 2-point function with one composite operator @xmath269 is , after using the wick s theorem , @xmath273 or in momentum space @xmath274 if we truncate the external propagators , we get @xmath275      to first order in @xmath87 , we have @xmath276@xmath277^{2}i\\delta(x_{1}-y)i\\delta ( x_{2}-y)\\ ] ] the amputated 1pi momentum space",

    "for example , consider the lagrangian given by@xmath315   -\\dfrac{\\mu^{2}}{2}\\left ( \\phi_{1}^{2}+\\phi_{2}^{2}\\right )   -\\dfrac{\\lambda}{4}\\left (   \\phi_{1}^{2}% + \\phi_{2}^{2}\\right )   ^{2 } \\label{o(2 ) symmetry}%\\ ] ] this lagrangian has the @xmath316 symmetry given below @xmath317@xmath318 the counter terms for this theory should have the same symmetry .",
