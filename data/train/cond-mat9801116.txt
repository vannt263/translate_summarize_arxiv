    "based on density - functional ( df ) theory , we have derived in previous work a set of integral equations , which allows to calculate the ion - ion and the electron - ion correlations in a liquid metal or a plasma , consistent with the bound - electron structure of the ion using only the atomic number @xmath5 as input ; these integral equations are named the quantal hypernetted - chain ( qhnc ) equations,@xcite which are derived from the exact expressions for the ion - ion and electron - ion radial distribution functions ( rdf ) in an electron - ion mixture . up to now , we have applied this approach to liquid metallic hydrogen,@xcite lithium,@xcite sodium,@xcite potassium@xcite and aluminum@xcite obtaining ion - ion structure factors in excellent agreement with experiments . since a liquid metal can be considered as a very special type of a high - density plasma , we can expect from the successful application of the qhnc - method to liquid metals , that this approach is able to provide accurate results for a plasma .",
    "in such a system , both the ionic valency @xmath6 and the electron - ion interaction @xmath7 may vary over a wide range as temperature and density are changed .",
    "our method is in particular suited to treat a plasma , since it is able to calculate the ionization @xmath6 and the electron - ion interaction in a self - consistent manner using the atomic number of the system as the only input data .",
    "recently , we have extended this formalism and have performed a first - principles molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation based on the qhnc theory for alkali metals near the triple point : in this study those small deviations which were still observed between experimental results and qhnc data for the structure factor disappeared completely.@xcite nevertheless , the calculation of the ion - ion rdf in an md simulation is rather time - consuming .",
    "recently , rosenfeld@xcite has proposed a new bridge - functional for hard - spheres ; its construction requires only fundamental measures of the hard - spheres . in combination with the mhnc - approach  by replacing the bridge-_function _ by a bridge-_functional _ of the reference system",
    " it was found out that this method is able to give very accurate results for the structure and thermodynamics of a large variety of one - component and binary liquid systems.@xcite therefore , with replacement of the md simulations by the mhnc method we can obtain accurate results for the ion - ion and electron - ion rdf s for dense fluids via the qhnc method using the rosenfeld bridge - functional .    in a plasma , density and temperature vary over a wide range .",
    "therefore , in order to check the applicability of the approach presented here to a strongly coupled plasma ( where no reliable experimental data for particle - correlations are available ) , it is important to examine to what extent the qhnc equations can describe a liquid metal in a wide range of densities and temperatures .",

    "@xcite measured the structure factors of liquid rb at high pressures : 0.2 , 2.5 , 3.9 and 6.1 gpa .",

    "_ : they found that liquid rb is compressed uniformly at 2.5 gpa , but that some deviation from uniform compression is observed at 6.1 gpa . in the present work , using the qhnc method in combination with the rosenfeld bridge - functional for the reference hard - sphere system we have calculated the structure factors of compressed rubidium , the pressure ranging from 0 to 6.1 gpa and compared these data with the experimental results .",
    "we find excellent agreement with these experimental data , although in two cases the density has to be slightly readjusted .",
    "we confirm with our results the uniform compression model .",
    "we find out that the effective ion - ion potentials are insensitive to this pressure - variation , a feature which is obviously typical for liquid alkali metals ( we also confirm these observations for the case of liquid - lithium ) .",
    "we finally observe that the structure factors coincide in one single curve if @xmath1 is scaled in units of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath0 .",

    "the bare ion - ion interaction is taken as pure coulombic : @xmath43 .    under these approximations , a set of integral equations ( [ eq : qhncii])-([eq : qhncei ] ) can be solved ; its solution allows the determination of the electron - ion and ion - ion correlations together with the ionization and the electron bound - states .    for the mhnc closure relation we have used in this work the parametrization for the bridge - function of a",
    "suitably chosen hard - sphere reference system that was proposed recently by rosenfeld.@xcite in this version of the mhnc the universality hypothesis of the bridge-_function _ @xcite ( which justifies the mhnc ) is generalized to the level of the bridge-_functional _ of the reference system .",
    "this functional can be calculated very easily for the general case of an inhomogeneous system of hard - spheres @xcite involving only fundamental measures ; the functional is then specialized  as required for our case  to a system of homogeneous hard - spheres .",
    "this fundamental measure bridge - functional is given in terms of characteristic quantities of the _ individual _ spheres and involves only integrations over known functions .",
    "furthermore , in this approach the functional can be optimized by imposing the test - particle ( or source - particle ) self - consistency , which is realized by the transition from an inhomogeneous system to a homogeneous one if the source of the external potential becomes a particle of the liquid.@xcite the ornstein - zernike equation is then solved for the structure function of the homogeneous system along with the closure relation where the bridge - function is calculated by means of the above _ functional _ , assuming that the universality hypothesis is valid .",
    "the obtained structure function is then fed into the bridge - functional yielding a new , improved bridge - function .",
    "this procedure is iterated until numerical self - consistency is obtained in a sense that the structure function of the preceding step differs only marginally from the present step .",
    "this method , which we denote by qhnc - mh , is in fact able to produce accurate data for the structure factors of rb as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq313 ] in the direct comparison with experiments@xcite at the triple point ( 313 k ) ; the experimental data are denoted by the open and black circles .",
    "in this section , we apply the qhnc - mh method to calculate the structure factors for compressed liquid - rubidium under high pressure ( 0.2 , 2.5 , 3.9 , and 6.1 gpa ) , i.e. , exactly the same pressure - values under which tsuji _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed their experiments to measure the structure factors .",
    "the corresponding densities are estimated by these authors to be 1.07 , 1.41 , 1.56 and 1.95 times the normal density ; the temperatures are 370 , 520 , 540 and 570 k , respectively .    in a first step",
    "we apply our method to the 3.9 gpa state and examine how accurately the mhnc equation ( in combination with the rosenfeld bridge - function ) is able to reproduce the rdf obtained in an md simulation : the comparison is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rdfmd ] , where the qhnc - mh result ( full curve ) is found to be undistinguishable from the md rdf ( open circles ) .",
    "this comparison confirms that the qhnc - mh method is able to produce reliable structure - data that are as accurate as those obtained in computer - experiments even for compressed liquids at high densities ; hence , md simulations are no longer required in this study .",
    "we can therefore proceed to compare the qhnc - mh results with _",
    "data for all high - pressure states : the structure factors calculated for pressures ranging from 0.2 to 6.1 gpa are plotted by full curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqall ] in comparison with the experimental results shown by full circles .",
    "we have found that our method gives structure factors in good agreement with experiment for 0.2 and 6.1 gpa .",
    "however , in the case of 2.5 and 3.9 gpa , the agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is not so convincing : a systematic deviation between the data sets is observed . in their analysis of their experiment ,",
    "tsuji _ et al . _",
    "@xcite estimated the density of liquid rb under pressure from the measured lattice constant of crystalline rb including corrections for the thermal expansion and the volume jump at melting . however , according to tsuji,@xcite there remains an uncertainty in the evaluation of the density , that might be responsible for these deviations .",
    "therefore , we have modified the density for the 3.9 gpa case : when decreasing the ion - sphere radius ( wigner - seitz radius ) @xmath0 [ @xmath44 and @xmath4 being the specific volume per ion ] by a factor of 1/1.05 we can find indeed a good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results for the 3.9 gpa state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqrees ] ; a similar good agreement is found also for the 2.5 gpa case if the wigner - seitz radius @xmath0 is decreased by 5 % .",
    "it should be mentioned that the concept of our qhnc - method is for high pressures as reliable and valid as for the room pressure , since all the approximations entering this method remain valid as the pressure is increased .",
    "this fact can be seen from the result for the electronic structure , which will be discussed in the following .",
    "the bound levels of the ion in compressed liquid rb are almost the same as those at room pressure . as a consequence ,",
    "the electron - ion rdf s remain  as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdfei ]  almost unchanged for the five states considered .",
    "the electron - ion dcf @xmath25 is determined by eq .",

    "( [ e : sei2 ] ) can be represented in @xmath48-space as @xmath49 which states that the free - electron distribution @xmath50 around an ion can be described exactly by the superposition of surrounding  neutral pseudoatoms \" .",
    "each ion carries a screening electron - cloud @xmath51 [ with @xmath52 , and makes it thus electrically neutral ( including the core - electrons ) as if it were an atom .",
    "therefore , in this formalism a liquid metal can be considered to be composed by neutral pseudoatoms . using eq .",
    "( [ e : qrho ] ) , the free - electron density distribution of a pseudoatom is calculated for liquid rb under high pressures ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pseudatom ] ) : the results indicate that the electron - density distribution of a pseudoatom suffers no significant change outside of the core - region ( where the bound - electron density is large ) under this pressure - variation .",
    "summarizing , we can conclude that a pseudoatom remains almost unchanged in comparison to room pressure even when the density is increased by a factor of nearly 2 ( high pressure - state 6.1 gpa ) . on the other hand , tsuji _",
    "et al_. expected that a hard - sphere model@xcite might be successfully applied to describe the structure of liquid alkali metals and that the effective diameter of the hard - sphere should vary with pressure due to the change in the screening effect ; that is , the size of a pseudoatom is assumed to be changed with pressure .",
    "based on this model , the effective hard - sphere radius @xmath53 is considered to vary under pressure - variation keeping the packing fraction @xmath54 to be constant at a value of 0.45 ; this leads to a uniform - compression model in which the position of first peak @xmath2 in the structure factor should increase proportionally to @xmath55 with increasing pressure .",
    "we also find in our approach that the effective ion - ion interaction for liquid rb is practically invariant under this pressure - variations ( cf .",
    "8) , i.e. , it remains almost the same as the one at room pressure .",
    "in contrast to the hard - sphere model , where the essential repulsive part of the effective ion - ion potential should be scaled in units of @xmath0 , no scaling feature is observed for the effective ion - ion interaction in units of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath0 . nevertheless , all the structure factors for all these five pressure - values almost coincide in one single curve when scaling the wavenumber in units of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath0 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaledsq ] ) .",
    "even if the liquid - rubidium potential under these pressure - variations can be considered as invariant with respect to the one at room pressure ( neglecting small deviation ) , we have also observed the above mentioned scaling property in the structure factor ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scaledsq ] ) ; this means that the liquid - rubidium potential has a very special feature . for",
    "a _ general _ liquid ( the lennard - jones potential for example ) , it is impossible to display the structure factor of two different states , scaled in length - units in such a way that they practically coincide . for a liquid alkali metal",
    "such a scaling property _ can _ be observed : to examine this , let us consider liquid li as a further example . at",
    "first we calculate the effective ion - ion interaction of liquid li at room pressure ( 470 k , @xmath56 with @xmath57 ) , and assume  as for rb  that the effective li potential is unchanged with respect to the one at room pressure .",
    "then , we can easily find the following three sets of temperatures and densities : ( 470 k , @xmath56 ) , ( 600 k , 1.34@xmath56 ) and ( 750 k , 2.37@xmath56 ) , i.e. states for which the structure factors can be scaled almost in a single curve in unit of @xmath0 , as demonstrated in fig  [ fig : lisq ] . for alkali liquid metals ,",
    "this scaled structure factor is not very sensitive to states specified by the plasma parameter @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the sufficiently high - density region .",
    "this is the main reason why structure factors of all alkali liquids ( from li to cs ) near the triple point coincide almost in a single curve when scaling @xmath1 in units of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath0 , as was observed experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite    this scaling property in the structure factors of liquid rb signifies that the first peak of the structure factor appears almost at the same position @xmath60 ( in scaled units ) for all these pressures ; this means that the position of the first peak @xmath2 in the structure factor ( taken in absolute values ) should increase proportionally to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the specific volume at room pressure . in our calculation , this peak - position in reduced units is estimated from fig .",
    "[ fig : scaledsq ] to be @xmath63 , from which we obtain the relation @xmath64 because of @xmath65 ; this linear relation is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : q1unif ] . in this figure , the full and the open circles denote the experimental points obtained for several states by tsuji _ et al._;@xcite in particular ,",
    "the five full circles represent those states which we have investigated in our theoretical study , i.e. , for pressure - values 0 , 0.2 , 2.5 , 3.9 , and 6.1 gpa , respectively .",
    "these _ experimental _",
    "@xmath2-points in fig .",
    "[ eq : qhncei ] are close to the linear relation which was determined from the _ calculated _ structure factors ; thus , this figure demonstrates that the uniform - compression model ( corresponding to a linear relation denoted by the full line ) is indeed valid , although there is some uncertainty due to difficulties in estimating the density and to problems in experiments under high pressure , in general .",
    "the qhnc method in combination with the rosenfeld bridge - functional has been shown to reproduce the experimental structure factors of liquid rb under high pressures ( ranging from 0 to 6.1 gpa ) very accurately ; for the case of 2.5 and 3.6 gpa the experimentally estimated densities have to be readjusted in terms of a 5 % variation of the wigner seitz radius @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore we observe that the structure factors coincide almost in one single curve if wavenumber are scaled in units of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scaledsq ] ) .",
    "this indicates clearly that liquid rb is uniformly compressed as the pressure is increased : this , in turn signifies , that the first peak - position @xmath2 of the structure factors increases proportional to @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q1unif ] ) .",
    "it must be mentioned that in contrast to our result , shimojo _",
    "et al._@xcite conclude from their result obtained in the first - principles md simulations that some deviation from uniform compression exists for the 6.1 gpa state , though liquid rb is compressed uniformly at 2.5 gpa .",
    "their experimental rdf s for 2.5 and 6.1 gpa are obtained by a fourier transform of the experimental structure factors of tsuji _",
    "et al_. on the basis of the rdf s they observe a different behaviour than on the basis of the structure factor , although they have used the same experimental structure factors and rb states as we did : ( i ) the first - peak position in the rdf at 2.5 gpa follows the uniform compression model , while the first - peak position in the rdf at 6.1 gpa shows a deviation from the uniform compression model .",
    "thus , they have asserted that their calculated result agrees with the experiment .",
    "( ii ) in contrast to their rdf s , the experimental structure factor at 2.5 gpa shows a substantial deviation from the uniform compression compared to the 6.1 gpa state ; the position @xmath2 of the first peak in @xmath67 lies far away from the uniform compression line in fig .",
    "[ fig : q1unif ] while on the other hand , the experimental structure factor at 6.1 gpa shows that the uniform compression model is still valid : the @xmath2-point for 6.1 gp in fig .",
    "[ fig : q1unif ] is very close to the uniform compression line .    according to tsuji,@xcite this discrepancy between the conclusions based on the rdf s and the structure factors is possible , since there is some experimental ambiguity in the value of the peak height in the structure factor while the peak - position is accurate and reliable . nevertheless , from all the experimental data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : q1unif ] , we can conclude that liquid rb is compressed uniformly up to a pressure of 6.1 gpa ; however , a more detailed discussion if deviations from the uniform compression model ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : q1unif ] ) have any physical meaning is not very conclusive , due to the uncertainty in the evaluation of the experimental density and the difficulties encountered in experiments under high pressure .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the structure factors of compressed liquid rb coincide practically in one single curve if wavenumbers are scaled in units of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath0 , despite of the fact that the effective ion - ion interaction remains under pressure unchanged with respect to room pressure ; this means that interaction potentials of liquid alkali metals have a special characteristic property , as we have demonstrated and confirmed in addition for the case of liquid li in fig .",
    "[ fig : lisq ] .",
    "the neutral pseudoatom in compressed liquid rb remains almost unchanged under pressure - variation , which , in turn , is the reason why the effective ion - ion interaction remains practically invariant , similar to state-_independent _ interactions , such as the one for liquid argon .",
    "we have demonstrated in this contribution that the qhnc method can treat the outer - structure problem ( i.e. , calculation of the ion - ion and electron - ion rdf s ) and the inner - structure problem ( i.e. , calculation of the electronic structure of the ion ) in a self - consistent way using the atomic number as the only input data : therefore , this method can be considered to be very useful to treat a plasma , where the ionization @xmath6 is not known beforehand and where there is no way of constructing a pseudopotential to give the effective ion - ion interaction . from the successful results for compressed liquid rb presented here",
    "we can conclude that the qhnc method is expected to be nicely applicable for plasma states in a wide range of densities and temperatures .",

    "<S> we have applied the quantal hypernetted - chain equations in combination with the rosenfeld bridge - functional to calculate the atomic and the electronic structure of compressed liquid - rubidium under high pressure ( 0.2 , 2.5 , 3.9 , and 6.1 gpa ) ; the calculated structure factors are in good agreement with experimental results measured by tsuji _ </S>",

    "<S> we found that the rb - pseudoatom remains under these high pressures almost unchanged with respect to the pseudoatom at room pressure ; thus , the effective ion - ion interaction is practically the same for all pressure - values . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that all structure factors calculated for this pressure - variation coincide almost into a single curve if wavenumbers are scaled in units of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath0 although no corresponding scaling feature is observed in the effective ion - ion interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling property of the structure factors signifies that the compression in liquid - rubidium is uniform with increasing pressure ; in absolute @xmath1-values this means that the first peak - position ( @xmath2 ) of the structure factor increases proportionally to @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the specific volume per ion ) , as was experimentally observed by tsuji _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. this scaling property comes from a specific feature characteristic for effective ion - ion potential of liquid rubidium : even if the effective liquid - rubidium potential is invariant under this pressure - variation with respect to the potential at room pressure , we can nevertheless observe this scaling property for the structure factors . </S>",
    "<S> this property is obviously characteristic for the potential of alkali metals and we have examined and confirmed this feature for the case of a liquid - lithium potential : starting from the liquid - lithium potential at room pressure we can easily find two sets of densities and temperatures for which the structure factors become practically identical , when scaling @xmath1 in units of @xmath0 . </S>"
