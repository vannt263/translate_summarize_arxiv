    "the gravitational interaction may be an effective description of an underlying theory which does not suffer from the well - known problems plaguing einstein s gravity , as for instance perturbative non - renormalizability .",
    "these ideas are the starting point of quantum graphity @xcite .",
    "the target _ per se _ is understanding the emergence of gravity through model building of discrete quantum systems .",
    "a similar approach is analogue models @xcite , although in the continuum and considering quantum field theory as the main tool .",
    "the motivation for the introduction of simplified models for quantum gravity is understanding the features of background independence in contexts in which not all the obstructions typical of gravity are present and , in particular , better understanding the phenomenon of emergence in background independent contexts .",
    "the first quantum graphity model was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the basic motivation in @xcite was to construct a hamiltonian on a hilbert space associated to the degrees of freedom of a graph ( a set of nodes @xmath0 with cardinality @xmath1 and of links @xmath2 of cardinality @xmath3 ) such that the ground state of the hamiltonian is a graph which has geometrical properties .",
    "the initial hope , in @xcite , was that by fixing the parameters of the reduced model ( the one with _ on / off _ links ) , the ground state of the hamiltonian would have been a graph of average degree @xmath4 and with geometrical properties similar to simplicial complexes - dimensional simplicial complexes exists . ] .",
    "a second model , which we now describe , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for the introduction of @xcite was the interpretational issue of the external bath ( i.e.  the temperature of the system ) : how can it be interpreted in a closed system ( i.e. the universe ) ?",
    "the same problem arises in closed quantum systems , where one could ask why thermalization is such a general phenomenon despite the unitary time evolution on the hilbert space . in general the solution to",
    "the problem is strongly dependent on the _ observability _ of full hilbert space , i.e.  what part of it should be traced out in order to observe decoherence in the local observables . from this perspective , @xcite is a simplified model in which these questions can be answered in a background independent context .",
    "while the graph degrees of freedom are the same as the model introduced in @xcite , additional degrees of freedom associated to bosonic particles with a bose  hubbard ( bh ) interaction are present .",
    "the result is a dynamical graph with local interactions .",
    "the model introduced in @xcite and recently further studied in @xcite , focuses on the study of interaction between matter ( in the specific case , bosonic degrees of freedom on the vertices of the graph ) and the graph .",
    "the energy terms for links and particles are of the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 are hard core bosonic ladder operators on the space of vertices and links respectively and @xmath8,@xmath9 coupling constants .",
    "there are two other terms , namely a bh interaction , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a projector on the _ on _ links @xmath12 , and an interaction between the bosonic particles and the links , @xmath13 @xmath14 is a nonlocal projector which annihilates graph states unless the link @xmath12 is not on a triangle .",
    "this keeps the dynamics local .",
    "+ _ thermalization .",
    "_ simulations@xcite showed that , in the long time regime , the classical model evolves into random graphs . in the quantum case , instead",
    ", the damping of oscillations of graphs observables , e.g.  the degree of the graph , indicates that the model thermalizes to a metastable state .",
    "we studied the case of a 4-vertices graph with a link turned off and the others on .",
    "we observed dumping for the vertex degree observables .",
    "for the studied case , the asymptotic state turned out to be a mixed state of the graph with the link turned on and the link turned off .",
    "_ trapped surfaces",
    ". _ an interesting feature of this model , first noticed in @xcite , is that regions of high connectivity are able to trap particles of low energy .",
    "this was studied in detail in @xcite on a fixed graph .",
    "the graph chosen is the one of fig .",
    "[ 2dfig ] , which has a rotational symmetry : single particle states can be labeled by two quantum numbers , the shell position @xmath15 and the internal position , @xmath16 , thus states of the form @xmath17 . in this case , the problem can be simplified by noticing that the hamiltonian is diagonal in blocks of constant angular momentum .",
    "we can thus introduce , in the 1-particle sector , the _ delocalized _ states , defined as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of sites inside a shell @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ 2dfig ] ) the full quantum evolution of a delocalized state can be _ fully _ reduced to a 1-dimensional bh model if the initial state is delocalized , where the coefficients of the hamiltonian are opportunely chosen .",
    "this allowed to prove that the ground state , for the graph in fig .",
    "[ 2dfig ] , is @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , this reduction showed that particles inside the highly connected central region of fig .",
    "[ 2dkn ] feel a potential which is proportional to the degree .",
    "in particular , between particle states inside the central region and the outside regions there is an energy gap proportional the relative degree .",
    "this prevents low energy particles from escaping the trap , thus confirming the argument of @xcite .",
    "+ _ emergent curved space .",
    "_ another interesting finding of @xcite is that , in the reduced models , expectation values of number operators on the graph exhibit an emergent lorentz symmetry .",
    "the reduced effective 1-dimensional bh hamiltonian , for a generic rotationally invariant graph , takes the form , @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the relative degree between the shell @xmath24 and the shell @xmath25 , @xmath26,@xmath27 is a symmetry reduced ladder operators .",
    "the idea then is to study the following expectation values ( e.v . )",
    "the interesting result is that these e.v .",
    "satisfy the following ( closed ) relation on the manifold of classical states : @xmath29 this fully describes the time evolution of the probability density . in the continuum limit ,",
    "( [ eom ] ) becomes @xmath30\\psi(x , t)=0,\\ ] ] so it has a site - dependent speed of propagation for the density .",
    "this equation is everywhere locally lorentz - invariant , with a local speed of propagation given by @xmath31 . the higher - dimensional version of this equation is known to be related to the gordon background@xcite . in fact",
    ", there is no obstruction to repeating the same procedure for graphs which can be foliated in more than one dimension .",
    "thus , curved space is encoded in the connectivity of the graph ( i.e.  the local degree ) .",
    "the emergence of gravity in a background independent contexts is a complete new research direction within the field of analogue models . in the case of graph - based models as ours",
    "it is not always obvious what are the right questions to ask .",
    "indeed , we have shown in @xcite that by focusing on a particular set of graphs and by asking the right question , `` how does the particle probability density evolve ? '' , the phenomenon of emergence ( in our case of a lorentz symmetry ) can be identified .",
    "this happens because the graph we considered can be foliated , and then the states classified , according to this foliation .",
    "more recently , the same technique has been used to study the effects of disordered locality on the lorentz symmetry , showing that a mass term appears @xcite .",
    "we have identified graph configurations which , in a appropriate limit , can be considered as trapping surfaces . by considering delocalized states ( i.e. symmetry - reduced wavefunctions ) , we showed that high connectivity implies a high energy gap between particles being inside the region or outside .",
    "it is not clear , at this point , how general these models are and how many of the emergent phenomena of analogue models can be reproduced .",
    "we believe that many interesting questions related to background independence ( and emergent gravity @xcite ) can be addressed in such simplified models .",
    "the full connection between a graph and the low energy manifold associated to it is an open problem to address .",
    "it is tempting , given the large literature on regge calculus , to associate a simplicial complex to the graph when possible .",
    "on the other hand , it may be more physical to require that only the scaling properties - for instance looking at the heat kernel of the laplacian of the graph@xcite- match those of manifolds of a specific dimension",
