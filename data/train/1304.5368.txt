    "in this paper we investigate hidden charm baryons which come from the interaction of mesons with baryons , with the system containing a @xmath20 component .",
    "this can come from pseudoscalar - baryon or vector - baryon interactions .",
    "in @xcite this problem was faced and , mostly by means of the @xmath9 , @xmath21 and @xmath11 , @xmath22 components , a series of meson - baryon dynamically generated , relatively narrow @xmath23 and @xmath24 resonances , were predicted around 4.3 gev .",
    "the interaction used in @xcite was obtained from an extrapolation to su(4 ) , conveniently broken , of the local hidden gauge dynamics used for su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the local hidden gauge model is dynamically very rich and is considered a good representation of qcd at low energies . in the pseudoscalar sector",
    "it contains the lowest order chiral lagrangian @xcite and , in addition , the hidden gauge lagrangian provides the interaction between vectors and their coupling to pseudoscalars .",
    "it implements the vector meson dominance hypothesis of sakurai @xcite and , within this assumption , it also provides the second order lagrangian for pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar interaction of @xcite , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the use of the local hidden gauge lagrangian in connection with coupled channels and unitary techniques provides a tool that allows to study vector meson interactions in the intermediate energy range where the interaction itself gives rise to dynamically generated states .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath25 interaction , from where one obtains the @xmath26 and @xmath27 resonances @xcite and its extension to the interactions of vectors of the @xmath28 nonet @xcite , from where a few more dynamically generated resonances are obtained , like the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the properties of the resonances obtained are shown to be consistent with the radiative decay to two photons @xcite and to two - photon and one photon - one vector meson in @xcite .",
    "similarly , consistency with experiment has been shown in @xmath32 @xcite , with r any of the resonances of @xcite , and in @xmath33 radiative decays in @xcite .",
    "the extension of these ideas to the charm and hidden charm sector have also shown that some of the excited @xmath7 states and x , y , z states recently reported could be explained in terms of molecules involving mesons with charm @xcite .    the extension of the local hidden gauge approach to the baryon sector for the interaction of vector mesons with baryons has also been tackled : the interaction of vector mesons with the decuplet of baryons is studied in @xcite and with the octet of baryons in @xcite . in both cases some dynamically generated resonances are obtained which can be associated to reported resonances in the pdg @xcite .",
    "one step forward in this direction is the consideration of vector - baryon and pseudoscalar - baryon simultaneously in the interaction , which has been done in @xcite .",
    "a thorough work in this direction has also been done in @xcite .",
    "a review of the hidden gauge approach for vector - baryon and vector - nucleus interaction can be seen in @xcite .",
    "work in the charm sector for meson - baryon interaction has been done along different lines , which share similarities with the local hidden gauge approach @xcite .",
    "a different approach is done in @xcite , where one uses the analogy of the work of the @xmath34 interaction and replaces a s - quark by the c - quark .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , while the potentials obtained are fine with this prescription , in the coupled channel approach one is missing channels that mix charm and strangeness in that approach . in @xcite the work of @xcite is retaken and appropriate modifications are done in the potentials and the regularization scheme .",
    "similar work is also done by the jlich group in @xcite .",
    "all these works share the dynamical generation of the @xmath35 , which comes mostly from the interaction of the @xmath36 channel . some hidden charm baryonic state",
    "is also generated in @xcite , albeit with a binding of the order of 1000 mev , difficult to accommodate with the generated potentials as discussed in @xcite .",
    "as we can see , the topic of baryonic molecules with charm and hidden charm has attracted much attention , and the coming of the fair facility is certainly stimulating much work along these lines . yet , an element missing in principle in these works is the consideration of heavy quark spin symmetry , which should be a good symmetry when working with mesons and baryons with charm . from the point of view of heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) , which is a proper qcd spin - flavor symmetry  @xcite",
    "when the quark masses become much larger than the typical confinement scale , @xmath37 , one should consider in the same footing @xmath7 and @xmath8 as well as charmed members of the @xmath38 su(4 ) representation of baryons containing the octet of the proton and the @xmath38 representation containing the decuplet of the @xmath39 when their isospin and strange contents are the same .",
    "work along these lines is done in @xcite . in these references , an extended weinberg - tomozawa ( wt )",
    "interaction to four flavors is derived .",
    "the model for four flavors includes all basic hadrons ( pseudoscalar and vector mesons , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 baryons ) and it reduces to the wt interaction in the sector where goldstone bosons are involved , while it incorporates hqss in the sector where charm quarks participate .",
    "charmed and strange baryons are studied in @xcite , where among other results , a heavy - quark spin symmetry doublet is associated to the tree stars @xmath42 and @xmath43 pair of resonances .",
    "moreover , the model derived in ref .",
    "@xcite also accommodates naturally the three stars charmed resonances @xmath35 and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 was previously dynamically generated in other schemes based on @xmath46-channel vector - meson - exchange models @xcite , but in @xcite , as first pointed out in @xcite , a large ( dominant ) @xmath47 component in its structure was claimed .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the findings of the former references , where it was generated mostly as one @xmath48 bound state , since the @xmath47 channel was not considered in the coupled channels space .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite takes advantage of the underlying spin - flavor extended wt structure of the couplings of the model of refs .",
    "@xcite and it is used to study odd parity bottom - flavored baryon resonances by replacing a @xmath49quark by a @xmath50quark .",
    "two resonances @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are heavy quark spin symmetry partners , are predicted in @xcite and turn out to be in excellent agreement with the two narrow baryon resonances with beauty recently observed by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite . finally , in @xcite the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is extended to the hidden charm sector , subject of the current work .",
    "seven odd parity @xmath53like and three @xmath54like states with masses around 4 gev , most of them as bound states , are predicted in @xcite .",
    "these states form heavy - quark spin multiplets , which are almost degenerate in mass .",
    "as we will discuss below , here we will extend the hidden gauge approach , and the predictions found in this work will notably differ from those obtained in @xcite ( we do not obtain any isospin 3/2 states , and the isospin 1/2 states are significantly heavier , in the region of 4.4 gev ) . besides the use of different dynamics , both consistent as we shall see with the leading order hqss requirements , the scheme to renormalize the bethe - salpeter equation employed here is also quite different to that advocated in @xcite , which for the case of the hidden charm sector leads to appreciable differences .",
    "we will give some more details when our results will be presented .",
    "however , the hqss does not determine the potential , simply puts some constraints in it , so the determination in the works of @xcite is made assuming extra elements of su(8 ) spin - isospin symmetry .",
    "the work with baryons along these lines has run parallel to work in the meson sector @xcite . in these works ,",
    "an effective field theory ( eft ) that implements leading order ( lo ) hqss constrains is constructed and its consequences are derived .",
    "many dynamically generated resonances are obtained as hqss partners of the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and the @xmath57 , some of which can be associated to known resonances , but most are predictions .    in the present work",
    "we come back to the local hidden gauge approach and introduce @xmath8 and the members of the @xmath38-plet of the @xmath39 , as demanded by hqss , but the dynamics linking the different pseudoscalar - baryon and vector - baryon states is taken from the hidden gauge approach .",
    "we look again in the hidden charm baryon sector .",
    "what we find in the work is that the matrix elements obtained with the dynamics of the local hidden gauge approach respect the hqss for the dominant terms in the mass of the heavy quarks , something that was not known so far .",
    "another of the findings is that , within this model , the transition from @xmath7 to @xmath8 states is subleading in the heavy quark mass counting , as well as the transition from the @xmath58 baryons of the @xmath38 representation to those of the @xmath59 @xmath38 representation . in this sense",
    ", the findings of the present work give extra support to earlier works using the local hidden gauge approach where the different spaces were not allowed to connect .",
    "yet , in addition to the states obtained in @xcite from @xmath60 and @xmath61 , one obtains extra states from the @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which will be reported here .",
    "hqss predicts that all types of spin interactions vanish for infinitely massive quarks : the dynamics is unchanged under arbitrary transformations of the spin of the heavy quark ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the spin - dependent interactions are proportional to the chromomagnetic moment of the heavy quark , and hence , they are of the order of @xmath65 .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath66 of the hadron is always a conserved quantity , but in this case the spin of the heavy quark @xmath67 is also conserved in the @xmath68 limit .",
    "consequently , the spin of the light degrees of freedom @xmath69 is a conserved quantity in that limit .",
    "thus , heavy hadrons come in doublets ( unless @xmath70 ) , containing states with total spin @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) obtained by combining the spin of the light degrees of freedom with the spin of the heavy quark @xmath74 .",
    "these doublets are degenerate in the @xmath68 limit .",
    "this is the case for the ground state mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath75 and @xmath76 which are composed of a charm quark with @xmath74 and light degrees of freedom with @xmath77 , forming a multiplet of negative parity hadrons with spin 0 and 1 .",
    "the entire multiplet of degenerate states should be treated in any hqss inspired formalism as a single field that transforms linearly under the heavy quark symmetries  @xcite . for finite charm quark mass ,",
    "the pseudoscalar and vector @xmath7 meson masses differ in about just one pion mass ( actually one has @xmath78 ) , even less for the strange charmed mesons , thus it is reasonable to expect that the coupling @xmath79 might play an important role .",
    "this is indeed what happens when su(8 ) symmetry is used @xcite .",
    "conversely , we shall see that with the local hidden gauge dynamics , the transition @xmath79 , which is mediated by pion exchange , is rather small and vanishes formally in the limit of zero difference between the mass of the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 .",
    "something similar occurs with the transition from the @xmath58 baryons to those with @xmath59 . as a consequence ,",
    "four diagonal blocks develop when the hidden gauge dynamics is used while at the same time the relations due to heavy quark symmetry are exactly fulfilled in each of the blocks . with a different dynamics than the one provided by the su(8 ) symmetry , the numerical results that we obtain are also different from those obtained in @xcite and we will make a discussion of these results in the present work .",
    "we study baryons with hidden charm and @xmath80 .",
    "we take as coupled channels states with @xmath81 and a @xmath82 or a @xmath39 , and states with @xmath83 and @xmath84 or @xmath85 . for the different @xmath86 quantum numbers we have the following space states .",

    "+ 2 ) @xmath89    @xmath90 .",
    "+ 3 ) @xmath91    @xmath92 .",
    "+ 4 ) @xmath93    @xmath94 .",
    "+ 5 ) @xmath95    @xmath96 .",
    "+ 6 ) @xmath97    @xmath98 .",
    "+ attending to the spin quantum number we have thus 17 orthogonal states in the physical basis .",
    "next we will introduce a different basis , that we will call hqss basis , for which it is straightforward to implement the lo hqss constraints . in the hqss basis",
    "we will classify the states in terms of the quantum numbers , @xmath99 : total spin of the meson - baryon system , @xmath100 : total spin of the light quarks system , @xmath101 : total spin of the @xmath102 subsystem , @xmath103 : total spin of the light quarks in the meson and @xmath104 : total spin of the light quarks in the baryon .",
    "note that we assume that all orbital angular momenta are zero , since we are dealing with ground state baryons .",
    "thus , the 17 orthogonal states in the hqss basis are given by    * @xmath105 , @xmath106 , + @xmath107 * @xmath108 , @xmath109 , + @xmath110 * @xmath111 , @xmath112 , + @xmath113 * @xmath114 , @xmath115 * @xmath116 , @xmath117 * @xmath118 , @xmath119 * @xmath120 , @xmath121    the approximate hqss of qcd leads ( neglecting @xmath122 corrections ) to important simplifications when the hqss basis is used : @xmath123 where @xmath124 stands for other quantum numbers ( isospin and hypercharge ) , which are conserved by qcd .",
    "note that the reduced matrix elements do not depend on @xmath125 , because qcd dynamics is invariant under separate spin rotations of the charm quark and antiquark .",
    "thus , one can transform a @xmath102 spin singlet state into a spin triplet state by means of a rotation that commutes with @xmath126 , i.e. a zero cost of energy .",
    "thus , in a given @xmath124 sector , we have a total of nine unknown low energy constants ( lec s ) :    * three lec s associated to @xmath127 @xmath128 * six lec s associated to @xmath129 @xmath130",
    "this means that in the hqss basis , the @xmath126 is a block diagonal matrix , i.e , up to @xmath131 corrections , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are symmetric matrices of dimension 3 and 2 , respectively .    to exploit eq .",
    "( [ eq : hqs ] ) , one should express hidden charm uncoupled meson  baryon states in terms of the hqss basis .",
    "for those states composed of hidden charm mesons ( @xmath135 ) the relations are trivial , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , we can combine them to @xmath138 and finally @xmath138 to total @xmath66 .",
    "alternatively we can couple @xmath139 to @xmath140 , @xmath141 to @xmath142 , and then @xmath143 to total @xmath66 .",
    "these two bases are related as @xcite @xmath144 where the symbol @xmath145 stands for the 9-j coefficients .",
    "as an example take a meson(m)-baryon(b ) state of the type @xmath146 and look at the recombination scheme on fig .",
    "[ fig:9j ] .",
    "thus in this case we have the correspondence , @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 the total spin of the meson and baryon respectively .",
    "then one easily finds :    * @xmath15 @xmath150 * @xmath16 @xmath151 * @xmath19 latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath293 is the four - momentum of the meson , @xmath294 the three - momentum of the particle in the center mass frame , and @xmath190 is the total four - momentum of the meson and the baryon , thus , @xmath295 .",
    "this formula avoids an undesired behaviour at large energies when one uses a cut off method with a small cut off @xcite . as done in @xcite , we take @xmath296 for the parameters in eq .",
    ", which are the only free parameters in our present study .",
    "we solve the bethe - salpeter equation of eq . in coupled channels and look for poles in the second riemann sheet when there are open channels , or in the first riemann sheet when one has stable bound states ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "let @xmath297 be the complex energy where a pole appears .",
    "close to a pole the amplitude behaves as @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the coupling of the resonance to the @xmath300 channel .",
    "as one can see in eq .",
    ", @xmath301 is the residue of @xmath302 at the pole . for a diagonal transitions we have @xmath303 the determination of the couplings gives as an idea of the structure of the states found , since according to @xcite , the couplings are related to the wave function at the origin for each channel",
    "let us begin with the @xmath304 sector .",
    "we can see in the eq .",
    "that the large potentials are repulsive .",
    "so , we should not expect any bound states or resonances . yet",
    ", technically we find bound states in the first riemann sheet , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : i32a ] for different channels .    however , inspection of the energies tell us that these are states bound by about 250 mev , a large number for our intuition , even more when we started from a repulsive potential .",
    "the reason for this , which forces us to reject these poles on physical grounds , is that the @xmath207 function below threshold turns out to be positive for large binding energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : i32b ] and discussions in @xcite ) , contradicting what we would have for the @xmath207 function evaluated with any cut off , or in quantum mechanics with a given range .",
    "these poles are then discarded and , thus , we do not find bound states or resonances in @xmath14 in our approach .",
    "the wt extended model of ref.@xcite predicts @xmath305 , which leads to some attractive interactions in the space generated by @xmath306 , @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",
    "these give rise to three odd parity @xmath54like resonances ( two with spin 1/2 and one with spin 3/2 ) with masses around 4 gev .",
    "in addition , two other states show up as cusps very close to the @xmath309 threshold , and their real existence would be unclear .    our results for the @xmath310 sector",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res11 ] .    from the squared amplitudes of @xmath311 , we can find three clear peaks with non zero width around the energy range @xmath312 , which are not far away below the thresholds of @xmath313 respectively .",
    "the relatively small width of about @xmath314 of these states allows to distinguish them clearly .",
    "we have checked that in the energy ranges where these peaks appear , the real parts of the loop function @xmath207 , eq .",
    ", are negative in these channels .",
    "thus these peaks are acceptable as physical ones .",
    "then , because of the non zero width , we look for the poles corresponding to these peaks in the second riemann sheet , and find the poles at @xmath315 .",

    "indeed , a significant part of the differences between the masses of the resonances found here and those reported in @xcite can be attributed to the different renormalization procedure followed in both works . as an example , let us pay attention to the @xmath13 , @xmath19 sector , where there is only one coupled channel : @xmath308 .",

    "this difference can be only attributed to the renormalization scheme .",
    "large binding energies can not be discarded .",
    "for instance , interpreting the @xmath45 in the open charm sector as a @xmath402 bound state @xcite would lead to a binding energy of around 350 mev . on the other hand , the subtraction constant ( main difference of the two renormalization schemes ) generates terms at the next order of the expansion used to determine the potential @xcite .",
    "thus , different values for the subtraction constant can only be discriminated with the help of some phenomenological input , for instance the position of some states , that could be used to constrain such terms .",
    "we would like to finish this discussion just stressing again that , ignoring the difference in the mass positions , the isospin 1/2 states found in this work have a clear resemblance with those reported in @xcite .",
    "the predicted new resonances definitely can not be accommodated by quark models with three constituent quarks and they might be looked for in the forthcoming panda experiment at the future fair facility .",
    "in this paper we have addressed a relevant topic which is to show the consistency of the dynamics of the local hidden gauge lagrangians extrapolated to su(4 ) with the lo constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "these latter constraints are very powerful since they have their root in the qcd lagrangian and must be understood as a very stringent . to show the consistency we have addressed the problem of the interaction of mesons and baryons with hidden charm , a problem of much current interest in view of ongoing work at the bes , belle , fair and other facilities .",
    "once again the requirements of hqss demanded that we put together pseudoscalar and vector mesons , as well as baryons with @xmath403 .",
    "a series of relationships were developed for the transition potentials between the different meson - baryon channels in different combinations of spin and isospin .",
    "after this , we evaluated these matrix elements using the dynamics of the local hidden gauge approach and found them to fulfil all the relationships of lo hqss , while at the same time providing some determined expressions for them which allowed us to find out the existence of several bound states or resonances stemming from this interaction .",
    "we found seven states with different energies or different spin - isospin quantum numbers .",
    "yet , the fact that the interaction that we had for vector - baryon factorizes as @xmath404 produces matrix elements which are degenerate in the different spins allowed by the meson - baryon combinations . hence , up to some different mixing with subleading channels",
    ", we found a very approximate degeneracy in the states that qualify as quasibound @xmath1 .",
    "in view of this , the seven states that we found could be more easily classified as four basic states corresponding to a quasibound @xmath9 state which appears in @xmath15 , a @xmath10 state in @xmath16 , a @xmath11 state which appears nearly degenerate in @xmath17 and a @xmath12 state which appears nearly degenerate in @xmath18 .",
    "all the states are bound with about 50 mev with respect to the corresponding @xmath0 thresholds and the width , except for the @xmath19 state , is also of the same order of magnitude . the @xmath19 state which appears in the single @xmath12 channel has the peculiarity that it has zero width in the space of states chosen .",
    "all the states found appear in @xmath13 and we found no states in @xmath14 .",
    "the masses obtained here are substantially heavier than those found in another model @xcite that also fulfils hqss , but incorporates some elements of extra su(8 ) symmetry and a different renormalization scheme . in spite of this , this latter model predicts also the same @xmath405 quantum numbers for these states .",
    "experiments to search for the states predicted will bring further light on this issue in the future and we can only encourage them .",
