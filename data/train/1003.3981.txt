    "solar dynamo models predict that the toroidal and poloidal components of the global magnetic field are regenerated from one other .",
    "the poloidal field is transformed into the toroidal field from differential rotation ( the @xmath0-effect ) , and the toroidal field is twisted into the poloidal field ( the @xmath1-effect ) .",
    "these alternate and repeat in a 22 year cycle [ e.g. @xcite , 2008 ] .",
    "this toroidal field component , previously measured by @xcite [ 1994 ] using wso data over the period of 1977 - 1992 , provided evidence for an extended activity cycle of 16 - 18 years . @xcite [ 2005 ] also measured the toroidal field using mount wilson data from 1986 - 2004 and verified the dynamo model for the creation and reversal of the toroidal field .",
    "since we are facing a peculiar solar minimum , we want to investigate whether there is also some peculiar activity in the toroidal fields leading up to the minimum .",
    "three solar cycles of wso magnetic field data are available to us now , as well as a complete cycle observed with soho / mdi [ @xcite , 1995 ] .",
    "we first generated maps of the inclination angle for both the positive and negative field polarities using the wso magnetograms and the mdi synoptic maps .",
    "this is done by tracking the line - of - sight magnetic field , @xmath2 , for a given carrington coordinate as it crosses the disk .    , is the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we measure @xmath2 as it crosses the disk over various @xmath5 s . ]",
    "we can fit the measurements of @xmath2 for different longitudes to the following equation to calculate the average east - west inclination angle of the field , @xmath1 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is proportional to the true magnetic field .",
    "a derivation of this fit gives the following formula ( @xcite , 1994 ) : @xmath8 we fit the values of @xmath2 and @xmath5 into the equation for @xmath1 to generate maps of the inclination angles .",
    "following @xcite , individual regions are tracked across the wso magnetograms .",
    "for mdi , measurements of the same features in synoptic maps constructed using data from central meridian , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are compared .",
    "we generate two separate maps for each carrington rotation , one for positive polarity @xmath2 and the other for negative .",
    "the difference of these two maps gives the inclination difference .",
    "this inclination difference map gives us the east - west direction of the magnetic field at each point on the sun for each carrington rotation .",
    "the inclination difference maps for each rotation are averaged over all longitudes to show the inclination differences at each latitude over time , using both wso and mdi data . from these averages",
    "we construct the contour plots shown in figure [ incdiff_wso_all ] , and the line plots ( figure [ incangle_wso_all ] ) for each hemisphere .",
    "the wso data span 34 years , which gives us three solar cycles of coverage .",
    "however , the mdi values are somewhat different than wso , as can be seen in figure [ incdiff_compare ] .",
    "we believe this is due to asymmetric noise characteristics of the mdi instrument . in 2003 , soho began to periodically roll from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , which caused periodic irregularities in our data that need to be better calibrated .",
    "from the inclination difference summary averages , we detected the first emergence of cycle 24 some time during 2003 - 2004 .",
    "this emergence pattern is very much like the pattern observed in the previous two cycles .",
    "the new emerging inclination angles , which are related to the toroidal fields , are consistent with those from the previous cycles .",
    "this suggests that the toroidal field is not a clear indicator of the duration of the following solar minimum or the generation of the poloidal fields at the concurrent minimum .",
    "however , if the toroidal field is generated from the preceding poloidal field , we might expect to see that the next cycle s toroidal field will be weak .",
    "also , the inclination angle that indicates the toroidal field at the sun s surface is only a distant reflection of the toroidal field that is present wherever the true solar dynamo is acting . particularly in the higher resolution",
    "mdi data , the weak field regions that contribute to the analysis may also reflect the spatially averaged characteristics of a surface dynamo process whose contribution to the solar cycle dynamo is uncertain .",
    "further work needs to be done to solve the calibration issues of mdi .",
