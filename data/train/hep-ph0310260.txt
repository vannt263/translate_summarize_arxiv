    "self similarity is a familiar property in nature[1,2 ] .",
    "many of the seemingly irregular shapes of nature have hidden self similarity in them.it is not the usual symmetry with respect to rotation or translation , but symmetry with respect to scale or size : a small part of a system is self similar to the entire system .",
    "such a system is defined through its self similar dimension , which is in general fractal , hence called fractal dimension .",
    "classical fractals discussed in standard references[1,2 ] are cantor dust , koch curve and sierpinski gasket whose fractional dimensions are 0.63,1.26 and 1.585 respectively , which lie between euclidean point and surfaces .",
    "+ notion of self similarity and fractal dimensions are being used in the phase spaces of hadron multiparticle production processes since nineteen eighties[3 - 7].however these ideas did not attract much attention in contemporary physics of deep inelastic lepton hadron scattering , due to its obvious lack of applicability . although a related approach employing self organized criticality [ 8 ] , has been pursued in reference [ 9 - 12 ] for quark - gluon systems . only recently",
    "[ 13 ] , lastovicka has developed relevant formalism and applied it to deep inelastic electron proton scattering at low @xmath0 and proposed a functional form of the structure function @xmath1 .",
    "specifically a description of @xmath1 reflecting self similarity is proposed with a few parameters which are fitted to recent hera data[14,15].the specific parameterization is claimed to provide an excellent description of the data which covers a region of four momentum transferred squared @xmath2 and of bjorken @xmath0,@xmath3 . + more recently , it was observed [ 16 ] that the positivity of fractal dimensions prohibits some of the fitted parameters of the structure function of reference[13 ] . specifically out of the fractal dimensions @xmath4,@xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 one ( @xmath6)was estimated to be negative ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however the positivity of fractal dimension forbids such negative value .",
    "+ in order to avoid such possibility , we suggest that the proton is described by the single self similarity dimension d. this then facilitates one to compare the self similarity nature of the proton at low @xmath0 with the classical multifractals , which is the aim of the present paper . in section2 , we report the essentials of the formalism while section 3 contains the conclusion .",
    "under the hypothesis of self similarity of the proton structure at low @xmath0 , lastovicka[13 ] obtained the following form of the structure function @xmath1 , @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 are the self similarity dimensions associated with the magnification factors @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while @xmath12 defines the normalization constant.since the magnification factors should be positive , non - zero and dimensionless , a choice @xmath13 , rather than @xmath14 has been made , while @xmath15 is arbitrary small virtuality,@xmath16 .",
    "an additional parameter @xmath17 has been introduced in to make the structure function dimensionless , a point overlooked in [ 13 ] . explicit confrontation with hera data [ 14,15 ] yields , @xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "as the self similarity dimensions of all known fractals are positive[1,2 ] , by its definitions one expects @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 , a feature overlooked in the empirical fit of [ 13 ] as far as @xmath6 is concerned.further in analogy with other classic fractals [ 1,2 ] we also assume that proton at low @xmath0 is a monofractal with just one single fractal dimension , so that @xmath26 under such a hypothesis , equation ( 1 ) is rewritten as , @xmath27[(\\frac{1}{x})^{d\\log(1+\\frac{q^{2}}{q_{0}^{2}})}(1+\\frac{q_{2}}{q_{0}^{2}})^{d+1}-1]\\ ] ] for very low @xmath0 , @xmath28,1 @xmath29 in ( 4 ) , @xmath12 is the only flavor dependent factor , varying for different quark combinations",
    ". an immediate prediction of ( 4 ) is the slope of the structure function @xmath30 defined through @xmath31 yielding @xmath32 - 1+\\frac{\\log(\\frac{1}{\\log(1/x)})}{\\log(\\frac{1}{x})}\\ ] ] recently hera data at low @xmath0 [ 17 ] have been parameterized through ( 5 ) with @xmath33 where @xmath34,@xmath35 and @xmath36 consistent with qcd expectation [ 18,19 ] above regge regime[20 ] . equating ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ,",
    "we obtain the fractal dimension of proton to be , @xmath37 equation ( 8) is the main result of the present paper .",
    "in figure 1 - 4 , we plot @xmath38 versus @xmath0[equation(8 ) ] for fixed @xmath14 values,@xmath14=5,8.5 , 20 , 35 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 150 @xmath39 .",
    "it shows that the fractal dimension @xmath38 increases with @xmath0 but decreases for higher values of @xmath0 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this decreasing nature of @xmath38 for higher @xmath0 is more prominent for high @xmath14 .",
    "it has also been observed that at high @xmath14,@xmath38 decreases very slowly instead of increasing .",
    "+ in figure 5 - 8 , we plot @xmath38 [ equation(8 ) ] versus @xmath14 for representative small @xmath0 , @xmath41(0.00013),@xmath42(0.0002),@xmath43(0.00032),@xmath44(0.0005),@xmath45(0.0008),@xmath46(0.0013),@xmath47(0.002 ) and @xmath48(0.013 ) .",
    "it shows invariable decrease of @xmath38 as @xmath14 increases . in table 1,we",
    "also record the values of @xmath38 for a few representative data points.taking the average of the total 148 @xmath0,@xmath14 data points of h1[12]in the range @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we obtain average fractal dimension to be @xmath51 .",
    "our analysis thus suggests that if proton is viewed as a monofractal at low @xmath0,hera data[14 - 16 ] constrains its average dimension @xmath52 such that in its self similarity nature , it is close to cantor dust ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "+ let us conclude this work with a few comments.replacing the three fractal dimensions of reference[13 ] by a continuous function of two variables , equation ( 8) is a considerable extension of the parameter space and needs close scrutiny .",
    "a much more modest but meaningful approach would have been perhaps to make the @xmath6 of reference [ 13 ] vanishingly small @xmath54 and see how it differs the original analysis . furthermore notion of fractal dimension of proton",
    "needs clearer physical interpretation.lastly , the formalism developed here needs direct comparison with structure function data .",
    "these aspects are currently under study . + it is however tempting to speculate that the notion of monofractal versus multifractal craracterizations of systems pursued actively in other branches of sciences [ 21 ] might be of relevence even in the study of structure functions at low @xmath0 .",
