    "bounded repulsive potentials arise in the description of effective , coarse - grained interactions between polymers . because of their noncompact nature , mutual overlap between polymers does not require the actual superposition between the constituent monomers and is thus allowed , while still implying a steric repulsion due to the reduction of their available configurations .",
    "the prototypical example of these effective _ soft - core _ interactions is the repulsive gaussian two - body potential , whose thorough study  @xcite has shown how its equation of state , correlations , and phase diagram differ markedly from those of hard - core fluids .    in recent years",
    ", much attention has been given to another class of soft - core repulsive interactions which occur , for instance , in the modelization of ring polymers  @xcite or dendrimers  @xcite .",
    "these interactions differ from the simple gaussian potential mainly for being softer at small interparticle separation @xmath1 , possibly displaying even a minimum at @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "their fourier transform is not positive everywhere , and has a negative minimum at non - vanishing wavevector @xmath3  a property sometimes referred to as characteristic of the @xmath4 class of repulsive interactions  @xcite , which causes the tendency for the system to self - assemble into regular structures consisting of clusters of particles with a period @xmath5 , basically independent of density  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is similar to that giving rise to microphases in hard - core fluids with competing attractive and repulsive interactions  @xcite , although the physical origin of clustering is different in the two cases . in fluids with competing interactions , clusters occur because on the one hand the attraction favors particle aggregation , while on the other hand the repulsion prevents the aggregates from growing beyond a certain size . in @xmath4 repulsive potentials , instead ,",
    "clustering is due to the fact that particles are allowed to superimpose to each other at the price of a very small mutual repulsion .",
    "the formation of cluster phases in @xmath4 potentials has been investigated in detail for the generalized exponential model ( gem ) with interaction of the form  @xcite : @xmath6 \\ , .",
    "\\label{gem}\\ ] ] in this case one finds that , when the density is increased at sufficiently high temperature , the homogeneous fluid is replaced first by a cluster bcc phase , then by a cluster fcc phase at higher density . below a triple - point temperature @xmath7 ,",
    "the bcc phase disappears , and the only transition left is that between the fluid and the fcc cluster phase  @xcite until , at even lower temperatures , the fcc phase splits into a sequence of fcc phases connected to each other by isostructural transitions , in which the lattice constant jumps discontinuously  @xcite .",
    "another family of potentials of this class has been proposed as a modelization of the effective interactions between amphiphilic dendrimers with a solvophobic core and a solvophilic shell  @xcite . in particular , for a specific choice of the parameters which determine the potentials between adjacent and non - adjacent monomers of the dendrimer , the interaction between two isolated dendrimers can be accurately represented by a fit to a sum of two gaussians of opposite sign  @xcite : @xmath8-\\epsilon_{2}\\exp[-(r / r_{2})^{2 } ] \\ , , \\label{dendr}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the boltzmann constant , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the diameter of the core monomers .",
    "a plot of this potential is displayed in figure  [ fig : dendr ] .",
    "its fourier transform @xmath16 in the neighborhood of the minimum is shown in the inset .     of eq .",
    "( [ dendr ] ) for the interaction between two isolated dendrimers .",
    "the inset shows the fourier transform of the potential @xmath16 in the neighborhood of the wave vector @xmath17 at which it attains its minimum.,width=340 ]    the main qualitative difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is that in the latter , @xmath2 corresponds to a minimum rather than a maximum , and the maximum is assumed for @xmath20 .",
    "this is due to the fact that at small separation between the dendrimers , the overlap between the solvophobic cores contrasts that between the solvophilic shells , thereby leading to a decrease in the repulsion with respect to that felt at intermediate separation when the cores do not overlap , but the shells still do .",
    "even though the formation of cluster crystals in dendrimers has already been addressed by computer simulation  @xcite , to our knowledge the phase diagram of a system of effective particles interacting by the pair potential  ( [ dendr ] ) has not been considered yet . in the present work",
    ", we address this problem by density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "we have used a simple , mean - field like free - energy functional , which has already been adopted many times to describe cluster formation in both the soft - core repulsion  @xcite and the competing interaction scenario  @xcite . here , we have given special attention to the procedure followed to minimize the functional .",
    "in fact , instead of describing the density profile by a given analytical expression depending on a small number of free parameters , we have not made any _ a priori _ hypothesis as to its form save for assuming that it is periodic , and the bravais lattice vectors which determine the periodicity have themselves been obtained as a result of the minimization .",
    "such a method is computationally more demanding than that more commonly adopted , but its unbiased nature is an asset , since it does not require any guess on the structures into which the system is most likely to assemble .",

    "this can be compared with the behavior on the spinodal line predicted by the rpa for systems which undergo a liquid - vapor transition : in the latter case , the divergence of @xmath40 occurs for @xmath47 , and the homogeneous phase is unstable with respect to separation into two bulk phases .    in the present case",

    "however , it should be recalled that , just like the spinodal line for the liquid - vapor transition , the @xmath46-line does not generally coincide with the boundary between the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous fluid .",
    "the latter must be obtained by comparing the free energies of the two phases , and may ( and usually will ) lie in a region where the homogeneous fluid is still mechanically stable .    in order to obtain further insight in the phase diagram and the structure of the inhomogeneous phases , it is necessary to turn to the minimization of the functional  ( [ dft ] ) . as stated in sec .",

    "( [ freedendr ] ) has rather important consequences on the phase diagram , because it would make the bcc phase more stable than both the fcc and hcp phases even at high density , thus leaving the bcc as the only inhomogeneous phase . in order to recover the stability of the close - packed structures at high density , in eq .",
    "( [ freedendr ] ) the interactions have to be taken into account at least up to the second - nearest neighbor shell .",

    "inset : same as the above for the grand potential per unit volume @xmath153 measured with respect to that of the homogeneous fluid @xmath155.,width=340 ]    these results are compared to those given for the same phases by the fully numerical minimization .",
    "it is evident that the two sets of data are indistinguishable on the scale of the figure .",
    "moreover , for both sets of data the free energies and grand potentials corresponding to different phases are also indistinguishable , although by enlarging the energy scale the small differences which determine the most stable phase at a certain density would be appreciated . in particular , eq .",
    "( [ freedendr ] ) predicts that the bcc lattice becomes unfavorite with respect to close - packed lattices for @xmath156 , in very good agreement with the position of the bcc - hcp transition shown in figure  [ fig : coex ] .",
    "there is , however , a difference between the phase behavior given by the unconstrained minimization discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and that given by eq .",
    "( [ freedendr ] ) , namely , while the former predicts the occurrence of the hcp phase between the bcc and fcc phases , according to the latter the free energy of the hcp phase is always higher than that of the fcc phase .",
    "hence , the hcp phase is not observed , and as the density is increased the sequence of phase transitions is fluid ",
    "fcc instead of fluid ",
    " fcc as in figure  [ fig : coex ] .",
    "nevertheless , it should be remarked that in both cases the free energies of the hcp and fcc phases are everywhere extremely close to each other : specifically , their relative difference is of the order of @xmath157 , while that between the bcc and fcc phases is @xmath158 .",
    "this is not surprising , in the light of the fact that the free energies of the fcc and hcp lattices become distinct only from the third - neighbor shell on .",
    "therefore , even though the numerical accuracy of the calculation is high enough to allow resolution of such tiny differences , speaking of a `` most stable '' phase in this context is somewhat academic , and one should more realistically regard the fcc and hcp phases as nearly degenerate .",
    "one also expects that whether the contributions to the free energy from the high - order shells will stabilize one phase or the other will most likely depend on rather specific features of the decay of the potential at long distance .",
    "we have employed density - functional theory to study the phase diagram and the density profile of a system of particles interacting via an athermal , penetrable - core potential @xmath19 aimed at modeling the effective pair interaction between dendrimers  @xcite .",
    "the potential belongs to the so - called @xmath4 class  @xcite , which is expected to lead to the formation of cluster crystals at high enough density .",
    "the results discussed in the paper confirm this prediction , and the main features of the behavior of the system are those already encountered in the study of the generalized exponential model potential @xmath159 $ ] carried out some years ago  @xcite . specifically : i ) in the inhomogeneous phases , the particles arrange into clusters localized at the lattice sites , such that each cluster contains many particles .",
    "ii ) the lattice spacing is nearly independent of density , which in turn implies that the number of particles per cluster is a nearly linear function of density . in the present system",
    "the localization is even stronger than that observed in the gem potential , because of the local minimum presented by @xmath19 at @xmath2 .",
    "iii ) as the density is increased , one observes a transition from the bcc structure to close - packed structures .",
    "here we find both hcp and fcc phases , while for the gem potential the hcp phase was not observed .",
    "the density functional which we have adopted has the same mean - field form already used in the study of the gem potential  @xcite .",
    "the minimization of the functional has been performed by a parameter - free procedure , in which both the values assumed by the density profile @xmath27 and the lattice structure were determined as the outcome of the calculation .",
    "the only assumptions which we made are that the density profile is periodic , and that the _ unit _ cell can be represented by a set of mutually orthogonal vectors . although not absolutely general , this assumption does not necessarily rule out the occurrence of structures whose _ primitive _ cell can not be represented in this way , e.g. the aforementioned hcp lattice .",
    "the results thus obtained have then been compared with those given by the more common procedure , in which one considers _ a priori _ a set of possible lattice structures , represents @xmath27 as a superposition of gaussians centered at the lattice sites , and identifies the most stable structure among the selected ones by inspection of their free energies once the minimization has been carried out .",
    "the comparison shows that the gaussian parameterization reproduces most of the results obtained by the unconstrained minimization .",
    "in fact , for the densities at which the system arranges into a close - packed lattice , its properties can be already described very satisfactorily by further simplifying the treatment , and disregarding the contribution to the excess free energy beyond nearest - neighbor lattice sites , although this contribution is necessary in order to account for the transition from the bcc to the fcc structure .",
    "the only qualitative prediction which we did not recover by the gaussian representation of @xmath27 is the occurrence of the hcp phase between the bcc and fcc , the fcc phase being always favored with respect to the hcp .",
    "however , in both approaches the relative differences in free energy between the two structures are extremely small , so that labelling either of them as the more stable one is of little practical relevance .",
    "in fact , these differences are due to the interactions from the third nearest - neighbor shell on , which we expect to depend on rather specific details of the decay of the interaction at long distance . in the light of these considerations , for the system considered here the unconstrained minimization may admittedly appear as an overkill .",
    "one can easily imagine , however , that this may not be the case in other situations , in which the density profile is less amenable to being described by a superposition of gaussians .",
    "we plan to report on such an instance in the near future  @xcite .    before concluding this discussion ,",
    "one more consideration is in order : since the potential @xmath19 has been introduced as a representation of pair interactions between dendrimers , one may ask whether real dendrimers can be expected to display the behavior described above , especially as far as cluster formation is concerned .",
    "this depends on the actual relevance of many - body interactions , which are disregarded in the present picture .",
    "the very fact that , according to the density profile predicted on the basis of @xmath19 , most particles concentrate at the lattice sites leading to very high values of the local density , suggests that many - body effects are indeed relevant , and may significantly influence the behavior of the system .",
    "this conclusion was reached in a computer simulation study of an assembly of ring polymers  @xcite . for that system",
    ", the pair potential between two isolated polymers displays a profile similar to that of @xmath19 . in particular",
    ", it also belongs to the @xmath4 class , so that it is expected to promote cluster formation .",
    "however , it was found that at finite density many - body effects lead to an effective pair interaction which is substantially modified with respect to its zero - density limit , to the point that clustering does not take place . in such a situation , the pair interaction between two isolated ring polymers is clearly of little use in understanding the behavior of the system . on the other hand , a subsequent study showed that in dendrimers the formation of cluster crystals does take place  @xcite , although many - body effects are still very important . in fact , they prevent the number of dendrimers per lattice site @xmath105 from growing indefinitely , as is instead predicted by the two - body potential , and inhibit the formation of the crystal at high density , where a percolated network of dendrimers is favored .",
    "moreover , in line with this tendency of many - body interactions to curb the growth of @xmath105 with @xmath0 , the lattice spacing was found to be a slowly decreasing function of @xmath0 , rather than a slowly increasing one as in the present study .",
    "it should also be observed that the parameters of the interactions between monomers used in  @xcite are different from those used in  @xcite , and the resulting pair potential for isolated dendrimers leads to clustering at a lower density than that obtained with the pair potential  ( [ dendr ] ) considered here .",
    "nevertheless , it is reassuring to have evidence that for this system the formation of cluster crystals does not rest solely upon the effective pair potential picture .",
