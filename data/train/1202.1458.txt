    "though shannon showed in 1956 @xcite that noiseless feedback does not increase the capacity of memoryless channels , feedback s other benefits have made it a staple in modern communication systems .",
    "feedback can simplify the encoding and decoding operations and has been incorporated into incremental redundancy ( ir ) schemes proposed as early as 1974 @xcite .",
    "hagenauer s work on rate - compatible punctured convolutional ( rcpc ) codes allows the same encoder to be used in various channel conditions and uses feedback to determine when to send additional coded bits @xcite .",
    "the combination of ir and hybrid arq ( harq ) continues to receive attention in the literature @xcite and industry standards such as 3gpp .",
    "although it can not increase capacity in point - to - point channels , the information - theoretic benefit of feedback for reducing latency through a significant improvement in the error exponent has been well understood for some time .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "recent work @xcite casts the latency benefit of feedback in terms of block length rather than error exponent , generating new interest in the practical value of feedback for approaching capacity with a short average block length .",
    "polyanskiy et al . provided bounds for the maximum rate that can be accomplished with feedback for a finite block length @xcite and also demonstrated the energy - efficiency gains made possible by feedback @xcite . in the variable - length feedback with termination ( vlft ) scheme",
    ", @xcite uses an elegant , single , `` stop feedback '' symbol ( that can occur after any transmitted symbol ) that facilitates the application of martingale theory to capture the essence of how feedback can allow a variable - length code to approach capacity .",
    "a compelling example from @xcite shows that for a binary symmetric channel with capacity 1/2 , the average block length required to achieve 90% of the capacity is smaller than 200 symbols .    for practical systems such as hybrid arq ,",
    "the `` stop feedback '' symbol may only be feasible at certain symbol times because these systems group symbols together for transmission in packets , so that the entire packet is either transmitted or not . in @xcite , chen et al .",
    "used a code - independent rate - compatible sphere - packing ( rcsp ) analysis to quantify the latency benefits of feedback in the context of such grouped transmissions .",
    "chen et al . focused on the awgn channel and also showed that capacity can be approached with surprisingly small block lengths , similar to the results of @xcite .    using the rcsp approach of chen et al .",
    "as its foundation , this paper introduces an optimization technique and uses it to explore how closely one may approach capacity with only a handful of incremental transmissions . for a fixed number of information bits @xmath0 and a fixed number of maximum transmissions",
    "@xmath1 before giving up to try again from scratch , a numerical optimization determines the block lengths of each incremental transmission to maximize the expected throughput .",
    "we consider only @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 and show that this is sufficient to achieve more than 90% of capacity while requiring surprisingly small block lengths similar to those achieved by polyanskiy et al . and",
    "chen et al .",
    "while rcsp is an idealized scheme , it provides meaningful guidance for the selection of block lengths and the sequence of target decoding error rates , which we call the decoding error trajectory . a 1024-state rate - compatible",
    "punctured tail - biting convolutional code using the block lengths determined by our rcsp optimization technique achieves the rcsp decoding error trajectory and essentially matches the throughput and latency performance of rcsp for @xmath1@xmath4@xmath5 transmissions .",

    "longer block lengths would be required to overcome this overhead penalty .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : analysis ] reviews the rcsp analysis .",
    "section [ sec : algo ] describes the rcsp numerical optimization used to determine transmission lengths and shows the throughput vs. latency performance achieved by using these transmission lengths for up to six rate - compatible transmissions .",
    "this performance is compared with a version of vlft scheme proposed by polyanskiy et al .",
    "section [ sec : sims ] introduces the decoding error trajectory and shows how rcsp performance can be matched by a real convolutional code using the transmission lengths identified in the previous section .",
    "section [ sec : outage ] shows how the rcsp analysis can be applied to scenarios that involve strict latency and outage probability constraints .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "to review the sphere - packing analysis presented in @xcite for a memoryless awgn channel , consider a codebook of size @xmath6 that maps @xmath7 information symbols into a length-@xmath8 codeword with rate @xmath9 .",
    "the channel input and output can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the output ( received word ) , @xmath12 is the codeword of the @xmath13th message , and z is an @xmath8-dimensional i.i.d .",
    "gaussian vector .",
    "let the received snr be @xmath14 and assume without loss of generality that each noise sample has unit variance .",
    "the average power of received word @xmath11 is then @xmath15 . as in @xcite , the largest possible squared decoding radius @xmath16 assuming that the decoding spheres occupy all available volume is @xmath17 a bounded - distance decoder declares any message within a distance @xmath18 of codeword @xmath12 to be message @xmath13",
    "otherwise , a decoding error is declared . because the sum of the squares of the @xmath8 gaussian noise samples obeys a chi - square distribution with @xmath8 degrees of freedom ,",

    "the idea of rcsp is to assume that sphere - packing performance can be achieved by each transmission in a sequence of rate - compatible transmissions .",
    "thus the idealized sphere - packing analysis is applied to a modified incremental redundancy with feedback ( mirf ) scheme as described in @xcite .",
    "mirf works as follows : @xmath0 information symbols are coded with an initial block length @xmath23 . if the receiver can not successfully decode , the transmitter will receive a nack and send @xmath24 extra symbols . the decoder attempts to decode again using all received symbols for the current codeword , i.e. , with block length @xmath25 .",

    "however , this marginal probability is not what is needed .",
    "the probability of a decoding error in the @xmath13th transmission depends on previous error events .",
    "indeed , conditioning on previous decoding errors @xmath37 makes the error event @xmath38 more likely than the marginal distribution would suggest .",
    "the joint probability @xmath39 is @xmath40    we compute the expected number of channel uses ( i.e. , latency or average block length ) @xmath41 by summing the incremental transmission lengths @xmath42 weighted by the probability of error in the prior cumulative transmission and dividing by the probability of success by the last ( @xmath1th ) transmission ( as in arq ) , according to @xmath43 this expression does not consider delay due to decoding operations .",
    "the corresponding throughput @xmath44 is given by @xmath45",

    "the expected number of channel uses given by ( [ eqn : lambda_tau ] ) can be simplified as follows ( with @xmath47 ) : @xmath48 which yields an expected throughput of @xmath49    if we fix the number of information bits @xmath0 , ( [ eqn : rt_arq ] ) becomes a quasiconcave function of the initial code rate @xmath50 , allowing the optimal code rate @xmath51 , which maximizes the throughput @xmath44 for a given @xmath0 , to be found numerically @xcite .",

    "the original vlft closely approaches capacity with a latency on the order of 200 symbols .",
    "rcsp is unable to match vlft because the overall rcsp transmission can only be terminated after one of the @xmath1 incremental transmissions completes .",

    "a variety of well - known upper bounds on the packing density @xmath59 indicate that the maximum packing density decreases as the dimension @xmath60 increases ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) @xcite , making such codes difficult to find .",
    "however , we show in this section that a rate - compatible tail - biting convolutional code can indeed match the performance of rcsp , at least for @xmath1@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "we consider two rate @xmath31/@xmath62 convolutional codes from @xcite : a 64-state code with generator polynomial ( @xmath63,@xmath64,@xmath65)=(@xmath66 ) and a 1024-state code with ( @xmath63,@xmath64,@xmath65)=(@xmath67 ) , where the generator notation is octal .",
    "high rate codewords are created by pseudorandom rate - compatible puncturing of the rate @xmath31/@xmath62 mother codes .",
    "we restrict our attention to tail - biting implementations of these convolutional codes because the throughput efficiency advantage is important for the relatively small block lengths we consider .",

    "note that for every value of @xmath0 the initial code rate is above the channel capacity of 0.6851 .",
    "this is the benefit of feedback : it allows the decoder to capitalize on favorable noise realizations by attempting to decode early , instead of needlessly sending additional symbols .",
    "the rcsp optimization also computes the joint decoding error probabilities of , which we call the `` decoding error trajectory '' .",
    "if we can find a rate - compatible family that achieves this decoding error trajectory , then we can match the rcsp performance .",

    "the convolutional code s ability to match a mythical sphere - packing code is due to maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding , which has decoding regions that completely fill the multidimensional space ( even in high dimensions ) .",

    "this same assumption is made by the rcsp analysis , the vlft scheme of polyanskiy et al .",

    "while this assumption does not undermine the essence of this demonstration of the power of feedback , its practical and theoretical implications must be reviewed carefully , especially when very short block lengths are considered .",
    "an important practical implication is that the additional overhead of a crc required to avoid undetected errors will drive real systems to somewhat longer block lengths than those presented here .",
    "this will affect the choice of error control code .",
    "an important implication is that this analysis can not be trusted if the block lengths become too small .",
    "this assumption allows block errors to become block erasures at no cost .",
    "consider the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) : if the block length is allowed to shrink to a single bit , then this assumption turns the zero capacity bsc with transition probability @xmath87 into a binary erasure channel with probability @xmath87 , which has a capacity of @xmath87 instead of zero .",
    "both the practical and theoretical problems of this assumption diminish as block length grows .",
    "however , a quantitative understanding of the cost of knowing when decoding is successful and how that cost changes with block length is an important area for future work .",
    "mirf has an outage probability of zero because it never stops trying until a message is decoded correctly .",
    "with slight modifications , the mirf scheme and the rcsp transmission length optimization can incorporate strict constraints on latency ( so that the transmitter gives up after @xmath1 transmissions ) and outage probability ( which would then be nonzero ) .    to handle these two new constraints ,",
    "we restrict @xmath88 to be less than a specified @xmath89 . without modifying the computations of @xmath39 in ( [ eqn : pzeta_i ] )",
    ", the optimization is adapted to pick the set of lengths that yields the maximum throughput s.t .",
    "when there is a decoding error after the @xmath1th transmission , the transmitter declares an outage event and proceeds to encode the next @xmath0 information bits .",
    "this scheme is suitable for delay - sensitive communications , in which data packets are not useful to the receiver after a deadline has passed .",
    "the expected number of channel uses @xmath41 is now given by @xmath91 the expected throughput @xmath44 is again given by ( [ eqn : rt ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to bring the information theory of feedback and the communication practice of feedback closer together . beginning with the idealized notion of rate - compatible codes with decoding spheres that completely fill the available volume",
    ", the paper eventually demonstrates a convolutional code with performance strikingly similar to the ideal rate - compatible sphere - packing ( rcsp ) codes .",
    "an optimization based on rcsp identifies the highest throughput possible for a fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this optimization provides the lengths of the initial and subsequent transmissions and the sequence of decoding error probabilities or `` decoding error trajectory '' that characterize the throughput - maximizing performance .",
    "the rcsp decoding error trajectories computed in this paper are tightly bounded by the marginal error probability of sphere packing .",
    "designing a code with a similar error trajectory will thus yield comparable latency performance .",
    "rcsp predictions and simulation results agree in demonstrating that feedback permits 90% of capacity to be achieved with about 100 transmitted symbols assuming that the decoder knows when it has decoded correctly . however , the implications of this assumption for short block lengths warrant further investigation .",
    "vlft performance shows that if the transmission could be stopped at any symbol ( rather than only at the end of each incremental transmission ) capacity is closely approached with an average latency of 200 symbols , but a more careful analysis of vlft in light of the awgn power constraint is warranted .",
