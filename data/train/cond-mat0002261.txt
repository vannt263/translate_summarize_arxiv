    "it is well known that the biological , lipid bilayer membrane contains a mixture of lipids some of which , alone in aqueous solution , do not form bilayers at all .",
    "this presents the interesting question as to what possible function in the membrane these lipids can be serving@xcite .",
    "there are two lines of thought on the answer .",
    "the first is that the nonlamellar - forming lipids , roughly characterized as having a small head group and long , splayed tails , can with these tails increase significantly the local lateral pressure distribution in the interior of the bilayer .",
    "this increased pressure may be necessary for a protein or peptide to function@xcite .",
    "the second is that the nonlamellar - forming lipids can make less expensive the energetic cost to form a small , nonlamellar region which may be needed in processes such as membrane fusion@xcite .",
    "experiment shows that there is the expected correlation between the presence of nonlamellar - forming lipids and the ability of the lamellar phase to make a transition to a nonlamellar , inverted - hexagonal one@xcite .",
    "there is also a correlation between the concentration of such lipids and the ability to make other nonlamellar structures , such as occur in membrane fusion@xcite .    in an attempt to shed some light on the role in membranes of nonlamellar - forming lipids , we first introduced@xcite a relatively simple and tractable model of a lipid .",
    "we showed that it exhibited the polymorphism observed in experiment as a function of a single architectural parameter , the fraction of the total lipid volume occupied by the head group .",
    "we also showed that the phase diagram of a model aqueous lipid whose head group fraction was similar to that of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine was in good agreement with the measured diagram@xcite .",
    "we then considered a mixture of two lipids with the same headgroup but different tail length@xcite .",
    "thus they were distinguished by the different relative volume fractions of their headgroups such that one formed lamellar , @xmath0 , phases while the other formed inverted - hexagonal , @xmath1 , ones .",
    "we examined the density profiles of the tail segments from the two different lipids in each of the two phases .",
    "in particular we determined that , in the @xmath1 phase of the mixture , the density of the tail segments of the nonlamellar - forming lipid varied around the brillouin zone , with its density being largest in the direction between next - nearest - neighbor cores , as expected@xcite .",
    "we were able to make quantitative this expected variation , and found the relative difference in tail segment densities to be on the order of a few percent .    the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were carried out within self - consistent field theory , ( scft ) , and therefore ignored fluctuations . in this paper",
    ", we consider the effect of gaussian fluctuations about the scft solution .",
    "this enables us to determine the effect of fluctuations , within gaussian order , on the transition from the @xmath0 to the @xmath1 phase , and to observe the initial stages of the path between them .",
    "in order to highlight the effect of fluctuations , we examine the metastable lamellar phase near its spinodal in a region of the phase diagram in which the @xmath1 phase is the stable one .",
    "we find that undulations occur in the lamellae occupied by the tails , and that the lamellae occupied by the head groups pinch off to form the tubes of the @xmath1 phase .",
    "this is similar to scenarios proposed earlier by hui et al.@xcite and caffrey@xcite and which arose from their experimental observations .",
    "the hexagonal phase that is initiated by the lowest energy fluctuation mode is characterized by a lattice parameter which is within 1% of the stable @xmath1 phase , and has the same orientation : one in which the tubes are coplanar with the lamellae from which they were formed .",
    "this coplanarity is in agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "we observe that the nonlamellar - forming lipids dominate the undulations in the tail region , while the lamellar - forming lipids tend to fill in the regions between the cylinders as they pinch off . to make quantitative the effect of the nonlamellar - forming lipids , we examine three different measures of their role in the transition ; the correlation between the density fluctuation and the order parameter , the ratio of the susceptibilities of the two different lipids to fluctuations at the critical wavevector , and the overlap of the order parameter fluctuations of each lipid with the equilibrium @xmath1 structure .",
    "all these measures show the nonlamellar - forming lipids to play a significant role in bringing about the transition .",
    "having calculated the fluctuations in gaussian approximation , we are able to calculate all structure factors .",
    "we show here the order parameter - order parameter structure factor , which is the one most readily measured , as well as the density - density structure factor of either lipid .    in the next section we review the theory of gaussian fluctuations about an ordered phase@xcite and",
    "extend it to our model of lipid mixtures .",
    "results are presented next , and we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "we consider an anhydrous mixture of @xmath2 lipids of type 1 and @xmath3 lipids of type 2 in a volume @xmath4 .",
    "below we shall choose their architecture so that type 1 lipids form lamellar phases while type 2 lipids form @xmath1 phases .",
    "all lipids consist of the _ same _ head group of volume @xmath5 and two equal - length tails .",

    ", we expect that changes in the order parameter reflect , for the most part , changes in the densities of the tails .",
    "if the non lamellar - forming lipid 2 dominates the order parameter , then we expect that a positive fluctuation in the total tail density should be correlated with a positive change in the density of lipid 2 . as the order parameter",
    "is defined as the density of heads minus the density of tails , a positive fluctuation in the tail density corresponds to a negative fluctuation in the order parameter .",

    ", we have considered the susceptibilities of each lipid to a disturbance with a wavevector equal to that of the least stable mode . at the spinodal ,",

    "thus the susceptibility of the nonlamellar forming lipid to the perturbation at this wavelength is twice that of the lamellar forming lipid .",
    "a third measure of the relative importance of the two lipids is obtained by comparing the order parameter fluctuations of the two lipids to the order parameter in the @xmath1 phase itself .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "consider the first star of wavevectors of the equilibrium hexagonal phase which is the stable one at the temperature and composition at which the lamellar phase is metastable .",

    "the first four can be written as @xmath162 , and the other two as @xmath163 .",
    "as noted earlier , if @xmath164 were equal to @xmath165 , the first four wavevectors would lie on the edge of the brillouin zone of the lamellar phase , while the others would correspond to reciprocal lattice vectors of the lamellar phase .",
    "we can determine the fourier components with these six wavevectors of the order parameter fluctuations @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "this tells us how large is the overlap of these fluctuations with the equilibrium hexagonal structure .",
    "we denote this fourier component @xmath166 , @xmath167 in general , it is complex so we calculate @xmath168 , which is real . at @xmath122 , @xmath123 , we find      if the fluctuations had hexagonal symmetry , the two values would be equal .",

    ".    we next display the way in which the fluctuations of the lamellar phase near its spinodal indicate the beginning of the path to the stable @xmath1 phase .",

    "@xcite . due to isotropy in the @xmath143 plane ,",
    "the fluctuation modes are infinitely degenerate in the @xmath144 plane , that is , all fluctuation modes with the same magnitude @xmath184 have the same energy of excitation .",
    "if one particular direction is preferentially excited , the mode leads to the formation of ordered cylinders as we have seen above .",
    "but if several directions are excited simulataneously , then the ripples in the corresponding directions will interfere with one another .",
    "one pattern that can be obtained is a periodic array of holes , in the lamellae , producing a perforated lameller phase@xcite .",
    "these perforations are similar to pores in the membrane@xcite , and to stalks@xcite .",
    "finally , we display the effect of the fluctuation mode with the lowest energy on the difference in the tail distribution of the two lipids .",
    "the tail distribution of lipid @xmath9 as calculated in the self - consistent field theory , without fluctuations , is @xmath185 .",
    "we add the contribution to this distribution from the fluctuation mode with the lowest energy , @xmath186 where @xmath172 is , again , an amplitude which we can adjust . in order to compare the tail distributions of the two lipids",
    ", we must take account of the fact that , because the concentrations of the two lipids are unequal , they have different average tail segment densities @xmath187 therefore we utilize the quantity @xmath188 and plot @xmath189 for various values of @xmath172 .",
    "this shows us how the fluctuations about the lamellar phase tend to spatially arrange the two different lipids .",
    "again we place ourselves at the point in the phase diagram at which @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "figure 7(a ) shows this difference within the self - consistent field theory alone , that is with @xmath190 .",
    "the center of the headgroup region is at @xmath174 .",
    "the grey scale is such that darkest values correspond to positive values of @xmath191 at which lipid 1 dominates , and lightest values correspond to negative values of @xmath191 at which the non lamellar - forming lipid 2 dominates .",
    "thus the density of lipid 2 is largest at the center of the tail region , which is expected as lipid 2 has the longer tails .",
    "the maximum and minimum values on the grey scale of fig . 7 correspond to @xmath192 and @xmath193 , divided into ten shades of grey .",
    "the maximum and minimum values attained by @xmath194 are @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "thus the differences in local tail segment densities shown in fig .",
    "6 are on the order of @xmath197 of the average tail segment densities .    in figs .",
    "7(b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) we turn on the contribution to the density difference of the tail segments from the lowest energy fluctuation mode , and plot @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 .",
    "the largest and smallest values attained by @xmath200 are 0.160 and @xmath201 in this sequence , one clearly sees that in the fluctuations , the non lamellar - forming lipid dominates the undulations of the tail region , particularly in the direction of the second neighbors , the direction which is most difficult for the tails to fill .",
    "the tails of the lamellar - forming lipid are initially relegated to filling in the region between the cylinders which form within a given lamellae .    in sum",
    ", we have employed a model system of a non - aqueous mixture of lamellar- and nonlamellar - forming lipids to examine the gaussian fluctuations of the lamellar phase near its spinodal .",
    "we have calculated the structure factor which would be experimentally measurable were the lameller phase sufficiently oriented .",
    "we have found that the initial stage of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 transition involves the formation of undulations in the tail - rich lamellae , undulations which are dominated by the nonlamellar - forming lipid .",
    "as we have noted , the lattice constant of the ordered , stable , @xmath1 phase is within 1% of that which would be produced by the lowest energy fluctuation mode , and the orientations are , of course , identical .",
    "there is also a coplanarity between one of the principal direction of the tubes in the @xmath202 and the orientation of the @xmath0 phase which produced it , a coplanarity observed in experiment@xcite .",
    "we have used several measures to show that the nonlamellar - forming lipid plays a dominant role in this transition in the mixture .",
    "because we have examined the fluctuations very near the spinodal , we are presumably seeing the beginning of spinodal decomposition .",
    "further from the spinodal , and in particular , near the @xmath0 phase boundary which is generally far from the spinodal ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , it is to be expected that the transition proceeds by a nucleation and growth mechanism , which may well involve some form of lipid intermediate structure@xcite . presumably by making a series of controlled quenches from the lamellar to the hexagonal phase",
    ", one should observe the progression from the spinodal decomposition mechanism of undulations to the nucleation and growth intermediates .",
    "certainly both mechanisms seem to have been observed in the same system@xcite . in either form of the transition , structures which are nonlamellar",
    "must be created . as we have shown and made quantitative ,",
    "the nonlamellar forming lipids tend to dominate the process of this kind which we have examined .",
    "this lends support to the line of argument that their role in the biological membrane is to facilitate the creation of such structures .",
