    "many extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetry or leptoquarks , naturally induce low energy contact interactions of the form : _ ^fx ( ^p_x f ) ( _ _ _ )  , [ eqndisc ] where @xmath11 is a first generation charged standard model fermion , and @xmath12 .",
    "these are referred to as non standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) @xcite , and can be generated by @xmath13 gauge invariant operators at dimension six or higher .",
    "future neutrino facilities , such as a neutrino factory @xcite , could be sensitive to such interactions with @xmath14 . formalism and current bounds @xcite on nsi",
    "are reviewed in the paper on which this proceedings is based @xcite .",
    "this proceedings reports on a preliminary exploration @xcite of the complementarity of current collider experiments and future neutrino facilities to these neutral current operators .",
    "we focus on neutral current nsi induced at dimension eight , from operators such as [ eqn2 ] ( ^p_l q ) ( _ _ h _ ) where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are sm doublets , and @xmath17 is the higgs .",
    "comparing with eqn ( [ eqndisc ] ) gives @xmath18 , where @xmath19 gev . so @xmath20 tev , suggesting that new mediating particles , if weakly coupled or in loops , are kinematically accessible to the lhc . in this case , their discovery prospects are model - dependent , and have been widely studied@xcite .",
    "here , to retain some degree of model independence , we consider effective operators at colliders ( lep2 , lhc ) .",
    "so we are assuming heavy new physics with @xmath21 couplings .",
    "we also assume that the new physics does not generate `` dangerous '' dimension six operators involving two charged leptons instead of two neutrinos , because these are strictly constrained @xcite .    in section [ lep2 ]",
    ", we argue that in some models , such as those considered by gavela _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , the dimension eight nsi interaction of the form ( [ eqndisc ] ) is accompanied by dimension eight contact interactions involving charged leptons rather than neutrinos , with coefficients @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mandelstam variables .",
    "in section [ lhc ] , we use the equivalence theorem to replace @xmath26 , and study the prospects for detecting @xmath27 at the lhc .",
    "rough estimates suggest that couplings @xmath21 are required for nsi to function as dimension eight contact interactions at lhc energies ( assuming @xmath14 ) .",
    "such contact interactions would induce few events ( @xmath28 fb @xmath29 ) , but at very high @xmath30 where standard model backgrounds are negligeable .",
    "we estimate that the lhc could be sensitive to @xmath31 .",
    "some nsi models , which suppress dangerous dimension six operators via a cancellation @xcite , could give rise to four fermion contact interactions with coefficients @xmath32 .",
    "such contact interactions are subject to lep2 bounds .",
    "we present estimates of the translation of the lep bounds to the @xmath33 coefficient of nsi .    as an example of a cancellation in the coefficient of a dangerous dimension six operator , consider a model containing an su(2 ) doublet vector and scalar with large masses @xmath34,@xmath35 , and couplings h ( ) _ 2^ + g",
    "( _ ) v^_2 the exchange of these two bosons gives the operators - ( ) ( e ) + ( ^ ) ( _ e^c ) =( - + ) ( ^ ) ( _ e ) where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are mandelstam variables . at zero momentum transfer ,",
    "the coefficient can be cancelled by choosing @xmath36 . however , at dimension 8 , operators arise such as ( ^ ) ( _ e ) [ dim8 ] we consider two independent dimension eight operators , with coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and that have four visible fermion legs .",
    "the lep2 experiments searched for dimension six four fermion contact interactions in the channels @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is a light quark .",
    "the published bounds @xcite can be translated ( to within factors of 2 , see @xcite ) to bounds on dimension eight operators , @xmath37 or @xmath41 , with the same external legs . if the np inducing the derivative operators has @xmath42 couplings to the higgs , then bounds on the @xmath33 coefficient of the dimension eight nsi operator , can be obtained by taking @xmath43 .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the resulting limits are listed in figure [ tab : lep2bds ] .",
    "although the bounds are quoted with two significant figures , they are merely order of magnitude estimates , as various constants could appear in the passage between four - charged - lepton - derivative operators and nsi operators .",
    "the opal experiment saw one @xmath44 event at @xmath45 gev , and published limits @xcite on @xmath46 at lep2 energies .",
    "this analysis allows to set the bounds on @xmath33 for flavour - changing nsi given in figure [ tab : lep2bds ] .",
    ", from lep2 , obtained using the assumptions outlined in the text . these could apply to nsi models where the coefficient of dimension six operators is suppressed by a cancellation .",

    "[ tab : lep2bds],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "as mentioned before , the bound on @xmath47 suggests that the new physics particles responsible of nsis would show up as resonances at the lhc , provided the interactions are perturbative .",
    "we want to take a more pessimistic approach , and study the prospects at the lhc for nsi involving quarks , in the improbable , but compartively model - independent , scenario that nsis appear as contact interactions .    in a gauge invariant dimension",
    "eight nsi operator , the @xmath48 interaction is accompagnied by @xmath49 , which could be expected to reincarnate , after electroweak symmetry breaking , as a vertex involving @xmath50 .",
    "this expectation can be formalised , at energies @xmath51 , via the equivalence theorem@xcite , which identifies the goldstone @xmath52 with the longitudinal componentof the @xmath53 .    in the equivalence theorem limit ,",
    "the partonic cross - section for @xmath54 is calculable , and small due to four body phase space .",
    "we obtain @xmath55 plotted in figure [ fig : sigd8 ] .    to determine the reach of the lhc in @xmath56 , we need to consider backgrounds , such as the @xmath57 + jets , and signal selection .",
    "we simulated nsi events using feyncalc  @xcite and madgraph v5  @xcite , to obtain the @xmath30 distribution of the signal leptons fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] .",
    "we also plot the @xmath30 of objects in a @xmath58 sample .",
    "the signal and background distributions are well separated , so asking for a @xmath30 cut of order 400 gev would reduce the @xmath58 backgrounds to less than @xmath59 fb and keeps 70% of our signal . in particular , this suggests sensitivity to nsi interactions producing taus .",
    "however , if such high-@xmath30 events were seen , boosted taus would be hard to tag , although they may show up as fat jets .     of leptons at the 14 tev lhc from nsi ( flat ) and @xmath58 ( peaked ) ,",

    "[ fig : pt ] ]    summarizing , the cross - section is small , but the signal is characterized by well - separated , highly boosted objects in a pretty spherical event . using these characteristics , especially a cut on @xmath30",
    ", we showed that the largest background , from @xmath58 can be reduced below the signal .",
    "the lhc reach depends on the value of @xmath33 , but if we assume the nsi signal is background - free , and ask for 100 events at a luminosity @xmath60 ( in fb@xmath8 ) , then the reach in @xmath33 is ~3 10 ^ -2/ [ lhcbds ] for example , for a luminosity of 100 fb@xmath8 , the 14 tev lhc could be sensitive to nsi - induced contact interactions corresponding to 3 10 ^ -3  .",
