    "the field of the of the @xmath2 quasar pair pc1643 + 4631 a & b contains a cosmic microwave background decrement ( jones et al .",
    "1997 ) which may be the sunyaev - zeldovich effect of a cluster of galaxies at @xmath3 ( saunders et al . 1997 ; kneissl et al .",
    "1998 ) . in an attempt to detect such a cluster ,",
    "we have carried out deep @xmath4 imaging of the field .",
    "no cluster is immediately obvious in the images , so we carried out monte - carlo simulations to quantify our ability to detect a cluster of galaxies in our images ( full details are given in haynes et al .",
    "1999 and cotter et al .",
    "model clusters were created using simulated colours of evolving galaxies in the redshift range @xmath6 , and added to our wht images .",
    "we then used photometric redshift techniques to try to recover the simulated cluster .",
    "as the cluster redshift reached @xmath7 and beyond , the lack of strong spectral features in the optical made the cluster increasingly difficult to detect .",
    "however , even at @xmath8 , where the characteristic lyman - limit break became detectable , a large fraction of the the fake cluster galaxies were still recovered from the simulation with ambiguous colours ( fig 1 ) .",
    "indeed , in our @xmath9 simulation , only one in five of the model cluster galaxies was identified as such by @xmath10 selection .",
    "the recovered colours were skewed towards the red in @xmath11 ; this is a result of confusion with other objects in the field .",
    "our original search for @xmath13 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) in these images ( cotter & haynes 1998 ) had recovered a reasonable number of candidates  approximately 1.1 arcmin@xmath14 , similar to the findings of the surveys of steidel et al .",
    "( 1996,1998 ) .",
    "the fact that our recovery of simulated high-@xmath5 cluster galaxies was so inefficient therefore prompted us to measure the effects of completeness and confusion specifically for @xmath13 galaxies .",
    "we ran 1000 simulations , each time adding ten fake lbgs to our images .",
    "fake lbgs were drawn from a schecter luminosity function with @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; all had input colours @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we used input half - light radii of 0.2 - 0.3@xmath19 ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ) .    then , using focas , we attempted to recover the lbgs .",
    "our selection criteria are chosen to be as close as possible to that of steidel et al .",
    "we select only those galaxies clearly detected with @xmath20 above the 3-@xmath21 isophote in @xmath22 , measure magnitudes in @xmath23 and @xmath24 through this @xmath22-band isophote , and then impose a colour cut of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , which is closely equivalent to the `` robust '' colour selection of steidel et al .",
    "first , we find that 53% of galaxies with input @xmath20 are selected to the isophotal @xmath27 limit .",
    "second , we find that , as for our fake cluster galaxies , a large fraction of the fake lbgs are scattered far away from their input colours .    in total",
    ", only 23% of the input lbgs with @xmath20 remain within the @xmath28 region of the @xmath10 plane ( fig 2 ) .",
    "therefore , the true number of lbg candidates in our images may be four times greater than the 1.1 arcmin@xmath14 we measure .",
    "again we stress that , while our @xmath10 filter set is slightly different from the @xmath29 used by steidel et al .",
    ", our search for genuine lbg candidates in these images finds a surface density at least as great as that of steidel et al .",
    "these results suggest that ground - based @xmath10 selection , while extremely successful at identifying @xmath30 galaxies , may miss a significant fraction of the population .",
    "this may have a bearing on the apparent discrepancy between the surface densities of lbgs measured in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) and in ground - based surveys .",
    "there are 12 galaxies in the hdf which have spectroscopic redshifts @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( dickinson 1997 ) .",
    "these galaxies correspond to those which would be detected by the `` robust '' lbg candidate criteria of steidel et al .",
    "however , one would expect , given the published surface - density of `` robust '' lbg candidates of @xmath33 arcmin@xmath14 ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) , to find only three such lbgs in the hdf .",
    "of course , cosmic variance will be significant for the hdf ; but it is striking that the apparent overdensity of lbgs in the hdf corresponds with our estimate of the fraction of lbgs lost to incompleteness and confusion in the ground - based images .",
    "we have carried out simulations to examine the effectiveness of searches for high - redshift galaxies in deep optical images typical of those obtained with 4-m telescopes .",
    "we find that the scatter of the recovered colours of model galaxies away from their model colours is two to three times greater than that expected from the photometric errors alone and arises as a result of confusion between the simulated galaxies and the real objects in the field . because of",
    "the effects of incompleteness and confusion , the surface densities of lbgs based on ground - based imaging may be underestimated by a factor of four ; this is consistent with the surface density of lbgs measured in the hdf .    to investigate these effects further",
    ", we will carry out more detailed simulations using our present data to investigate how the inferred luminosity function of the lbgs is affected by incompleteness and confusion .",
    "we also plan deep imaging programmes with the new generation of wider - field , high - image - quality instrumentation as it becomes available ."
