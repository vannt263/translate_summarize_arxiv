    "in particle physics , a typical search for a new particle or resonance consists in studying invariant masses of decay products and identifying a  narrow , localized signal spike on top of a slowly varying background .",
    "if the natural width of the particle under search is small , it can often be assumed that the shape of the hypothesized signal is gaussian and that its width is determined by the detector resolution .    in what follows",

    "a  positive value of @xmath7 can be used to claim that a new particle has been discovered . the frequentist statistical significance ( i.e. , the @xmath9-value ) of such a  discovery",
    "is derived from the distribution of @xmath7 under the null hypothesis that no signal is present in the data . proper evaluation of this significance taking into account the look elsewhere effect  @xcite is crucial for substantiating any claim of discovery .",
    "asymptotically ( i.e. , for @xmath10 ) , the distribution of @xmath7 under the null hypothesis is normal  @xcite . a  quick argument illustrating the extent to which this distribution deviates from normality for finite samples can be given as follows . under the null hypothesis ,",
    "the true value of @xmath4 is 0 .",
    "it is useful to expand the log - likelihood near this value into taylor series : @xmath11 where @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 maximization of the likelihood leads to the equation @xmath16 assuming that the contribution of the cubic term into the log - likelihood is small , the solution of this equation corresponding to the likelihood maximum is @xmath17 @xmath18 stands for the maximum of the cubic log - likelihood . using @xmath19 ( the maximum of the quadratic log - likelihood ) , @xmath20    under the null hypothesis , the typical value of estimated @xmath4 is 0 and , therefore , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath7 standard deviation and @xmath23 is a  dimensionless parameter specifying how far away the estimator is from 0 .",
    "the requirement that the distribution of @xmath7 remains close to normal can be enforced by imposing a  constraint on the shift of the estimator due to the cubic term : @xmath24 or , equivalently , @xmath25 coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be estimated by their expectation values under the null hypothesis and @xmath22 can be estimated from the cramr - rao bound , @xmath28 .",
