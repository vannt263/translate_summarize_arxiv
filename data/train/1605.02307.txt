    "series - parallel networks are two - terminal graphs , i.e. , they have two distinguished vertices called the source and the sink , that can be constructed recursively by applying two simple composition operations , namely the parallel composition ( where the sources and the sinks of two series - parallel networks are merged ) and the series composition ( where the sink of one series - parallel network is merged with the source of another series - parallel network ) . here",
    "we will always consider series - parallel networks as digraphs with edges oriented in direction from the north - pole , the source , towards the south - pole , the sink .",
    "such graphs can be used to model the flow in a bipolar network , e.g. , of current in an electric circuit or goods from the producer to a market . furthermore series - parallel networks and series - parallel graphs ( i.e. , graphs which are series - parallel networks when some two of its vertices are regarded as source and sink ; see , e.g. , @xcite for exact definitions and alternative characterizations ) are of interest in computational complexity theory , since some in general np - complete graph problems are solvable in linear time on series - parallel graphs ( e.g. , finding a maximum independent set ) .",
    "recently there occurred several studies concerning the typical behaviour of structural quantities ( as , e.g. , node - degrees , see  @xcite ) in series - parallel graphs and networks under a uniform model of randomness , i.e. , where all series - parallel graphs of a certain size ( counted by the number of edges ) are equally likely .",
    "in contrast to these uniform models , mahmoud  @xcite introduced two interesting growth models for series - parallel networks , which are generated by starting with a single directed arc from the source to the sink and iteratively carrying out serial and parallel edge - duplications according to a stochastic growth rule ; we call them uniform bernoulli edge - duplication rule ( `` bernoulli model '' for short ) and uniform binary saturation edge - duplication rule ( `` binary model '' for short )",
    ". a formal description of these models is given in section  [ sec : growth_models_recursive_trees ] .",
    "using the defining stochastic growth rules and a description via plya - eggenberger urn models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , several quantities for series - parallel networks ( as the number of nodes of small degree and the degree of the source for the bernoulli model , and the length of a random source - to - sink path for the binary model ) are treated in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to give an alternative description of these growth models for series - parallel networks by encoding the growth of them via recursive tree structures , to be precise , via edge - coloured recursive trees and so - called bucket - recursive trees ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the advantage of such a modelling is that these objects allow not only a stochastic description ( the tree evolution process which reflects the growth rule of the series - parallel network ) , but also a combinatorial one ( as certain increasingly labelled trees or bucket trees ) , which gives rise to a top - down decomposition of the structure .",
    "an important observation is that indeed various interesting quantities for series - parallel networks can be studied by considering certain parameters in the corresponding recursive tree model and making use of the combinatorial decomposition .",
    "we focus here on the quantities degree @xmath0 of the source and/or sink , length @xmath1 of a random source - to - sink path and the number @xmath2 of source - to - sink paths in a random series - parallel network of size @xmath3 , but mention that also other quantities ( as , e.g. , the number of ancestors , node - degrees , or the number of paths through a random or the @xmath4-th edge ) could be treated in a similar way .",
    "we obtain limiting distribution results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( thus answering questions left open in @xcite ) , whereas for the r.v .",
    "@xmath2 ( whose distributional treatment seems to be considerably more involved ) we are able to give asymptotic results for the expectation .    mathematically , an analytic combinatorics treatment of the quantities of interest leads to studies of first and second order non - linear differential equations . in this context",
    "we want to mention that another model of series - parallel networks called increasing diamonds has been introduced recently in @xcite .",
    "a treatment of quantities in such networks inherently also yields a study of second order non - linear differential equations ; however , the definition as well as the structure of increasing diamonds is quite different from the models treated here as can be seen also by comparing the behaviour of typical graph parameters ( e.g. , the number of source - to - sink paths @xmath2 in increasing diamonds is trivially bounded by @xmath3 , whereas in the models studied here the expected number of paths grows exponentially ) .",
    "we mention that the analysis of the structures considered here has further relations to other objects ; e.g. , it holds that the mittag - leffler limiting distributions occurring in theorem  [ thm : bernoulli_degree_limit ] & [ thm : bernoulli_length_path ] also appear in other combinatorial contexts as in certain triangular balanced urn models ( see @xcite ) or implicitly in the recent study of an extra clustering model for animal grouping @xcite ( after scaling , as continuous part of the characterization given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) , since it is possible to simplify some of the representations given there ) .",
    "also the characterizations of the limiting distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath1 of binary series - parallel networks via the sequence of @xmath5-th integer moments satisfies a recurrence relation of `` convolution type '' similar to ones occurring in @xcite , for which asymptotic studies have been carried out .",
    "furthermore , the described top - down decomposition of the combinatorial objects makes these structures amenable to other methods , in particular , it seems that the contraction method , see , e.g. , @xcite , allows an alternative characterization of limiting distributions occurring in the analysis of binary series - parallel networks .",
    "moreover , the combinatorial approach presented is flexible enough to allow also a study of series - parallel networks generated by modifications of the edge - duplication rules , in particular , one could treat also a bernoulli model with a `` preferential edge - duplication rule '' , or a @xmath6-ary saturation model by encoding the growth process via other recursive tree structures ( edge - coloured plane increasing trees and bucket - recursive trees with bucket size @xmath7 , respectively ) ; the authors plan to comment on that in a journal version of this work .",
    "in the bernoulli model in step @xmath8 one starts with a single edge labelled @xmath8 connecting the source and the sink , and in step @xmath3 , with @xmath9 , one of the @xmath10 edges of the already generated series - parallel network is chosen uniformly at random , let us assume it is edge @xmath11 ; then either with probability @xmath12 , @xmath13 , this edge is doubled in a parallel way and @xmath14 are switched , but we find it catchier to use @xmath12 for the probability of a parallel doubling .",
    "] , i.e. , an additional edge @xmath15 labelled @xmath3 is inserted into the graph ( let us say , right to edge @xmath16 ) , or otherwise , thus with probability @xmath17 , this edge is doubled in a serial way , i.e. , edge @xmath15 is replaced by the series of edges @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a new node , where @xmath18 gets the label @xmath4 and @xmath19 will be labelled by @xmath3 .",
    "the growth of series - parallel networks corresponds to the growth of random recursive trees , where one starts in step @xmath8 with a node labelled @xmath8 , and in step @xmath3 one of the @xmath10 nodes is chosen uniformly at random and node @xmath3 is attached to it as a new child .",
    "thus , a doubling of edge @xmath4 in step @xmath3 when generating the series - parallel network corresponds in the recursive tree to an attachment of node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 . additionally , in order to keep the information about the kind of duplication of the chosen edge , the edge incident to @xmath3 is coloured either blue encoding a parallel doubling , or coloured red encoding a serial doubling .",
    "such combinatorial objects of edge - coloured recursive trees can be described via the formal equation @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 markers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , one has to keep track of the number of blue and red edges to get the correct probability model according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . throughout this work",
    "the term order of a tree @xmath27 shall denote the number of labels contained in @xmath27 , which , of course , for recursive trees coincides with the number of nodes of @xmath27 .",
    "then , each edge - coloured recursive tree of order @xmath3 and the corresponding series - parallel network of size @xmath3 occur with the same probability .",

    "as has been pointed out in @xcite such random bucket - recursive trees can also be described in a combinatorial way by extending the notion of increasing trees : namely a bucket - recursive tree is either a node labelled @xmath8 or it consists of the root node labelled @xmath32 , where two ( possibly empty ) forests of ( suitably relabelled ) bucket - recursive trees are attached to the root as a left forest and a right forest .",

    "we will reconsider this problem by applying the combinatorial approach introduced in section  [ sec : growth_models_recursive_trees ] , and in order to get limiting distribution results we apply methods from analytic combinatorics .",
    "as has been already remarked in @xcite the degree of the sink is equally distributed as @xmath0 due to symmetry reasons , although a simple justification of this fact via direct `` symmetry arguments '' does not seem to be completely trivial ( the insertion process itself is a priori not symmetric w.r.t .",

    "the decomposition of a recursive tree into its root node and the set of branches attached to it immediately can be translated into a differential equation for @xmath57 , where we only have to take into account that the order of the blue subtree in the whole tree is one ( due to the root node ) plus the orders of the blue subtrees of the branches which are connected to the root node by a blue edge ( i.e. , only branches which are connected to the root node by a blue edge will contribute ) .",

    "unfortunately , so far we do not see a simple symmetry argument to show this fact ( such an argument easily shows that the rightmost path has the same distribution as the leftmost path , but it does not seem to explain the general situation ) .",
    "however , we are able to show this in a somehow indirect manner : namely , it is possible to establish a more involved distributional recurrence for the length of a random path @xmath1 and show that the explicit solution for the probability distribution of the length of the leftmost path @xmath103}$ ] is indeed the solution of the recurrence for @xmath1 .",
    "these computations will be given in the journal version of this work , here we have to omit them .",
    "second we use that the length of the leftmost source - to - sink path in a series - parallel network has the following simple description in the corresponding edge - coloured recursive tree : namely , an edge is lying on the leftmost source - to - sink path if and only if the corresponding node in the recursive tree can be reached from the root by using only red edges ( i.e. , edges that correspond to serial edges ) .",
    "this means that the length @xmath104 of the leftmost source - to - sink path corresponds in the edge - coloured recursive tree model to the order of the maximal subtree containing the root node and only red edges .",

    "combining these considerations and the results for @xmath0 obtained in section  [ ssec : source - degree ] we obtain the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : bernoulli_length_path ] the length @xmath1 of a random path from the source to the sink in a randomly chosen series - parallel network of size @xmath3 generated by the bernoulli model has the following probability distribution : @xmath105 moreover , @xmath1 has , for @xmath86 , the following limiting distribution behaviour : @xmath106 , where the limiting distribution @xmath107 is a mittag - leffler distribution with parameter @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath107 is characterized by the sequence of its @xmath5-th integer moments : @xmath109 as well as by its density function @xmath110 ( with @xmath89 a hankel contour ) : @xmath111      let @xmath112 denote the r.v .  measuring the number of different paths from the source to the sink in a randomly chosen series - parallel network of size @xmath3 for the bernoulli model .",
    "again we use the description of the growth of the graphs via edge - labelled recursive trees , but in contrast to the previous studies of parameters , here it seems advantageous to use an alternative decomposition of recursive trees with respect to the edge connecting nodes @xmath8 and @xmath28 , which allows to establish a stochastic recurrence for the r.v .  @xmath2 .",
    "namely , it is not difficult to show ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that when starting with a random recursive tree @xmath27 of order @xmath113 and removing the edge @xmath114 , both resulting trees @xmath115 and @xmath116 are ( after an order - preserving relabelling ) again random recursive trees of smaller orders ; moreover , if @xmath117 denotes the order of the resulting tree @xmath115 rooted at the former label @xmath28 ( and thus @xmath118 gives the order of the tree @xmath116 rooted at the original root of the tree @xmath27 ) , it holds that @xmath117 follows a discrete uniform distribution on the integers @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 , for @xmath121 . depending on the colour of the edge @xmath114 in the edge - labelled recursive tree",
