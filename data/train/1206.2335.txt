    "the alkali - doped cubic fullerides ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 = na , k , rb , cs ) are prominent members of a rapidly growing family of @xmath10-electron organic superconductors @xcite with superconducting transition temperature , @xmath11 , as high as 38  k.@xcite in the early days of fullerene research the observed monotonic increase of @xmath11 as a function of unit cell volume was attributed to the increased density of states at the fermi level , within a standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory.@xcite due to the three - fold degeneracy of the @xmath1-derived bands at the @xmath2 point , preserved in cubic structures , and to the well - established vibron coupling , the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect is believed to participate actively in the superconducting pairing mechanism.@xcite however , since the conduction electron s bandwidth ( @xmath12 ) and the on - site coulomb repulsion energy ( @xmath13 ) are comparable it was also argued that fullerides must be very close to a mott - hubbard transition.@xcite phase transitions from a superconducting to a mott insulating state were indeed demonstrated long ago upon intercalation - induced lattice expansion in compounds such as @xcite where , similarly to , @xcite expansion increases the repulsion / bandwidth ratio @xmath14 raising the importance of correlations .",
    "these notions recently received strong support with the discovery of , a cubic fulleride with the largest unit cell and low - spin ( @xmath5 ) antiferromagnetic mott - insulating ground state at ambient pressure conditions@xcite and where high - temperature superconductivity is revived under hydrostatic pressure with no structural symmetry change . strikingly , under pressure here @xmath11 displays a dome - like unit - cell volume dependence typical of unconventional superconductors,@xcite frankly inexplicable within bcs , migdal - eliashberg and related weakly - interacting models .",
    "conversely , precisely such a nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath11 had been predicted by dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) for the unconventional superconducting phase bordering a mott - insulating state at large unit cell volumes in a simple three - band hubbard model incorporating , besides a jt electron - vibron coupling , strong on - site electron correlations , caused both by the coulomb repulsion @xmath13 and by hund s rule exchange , @xmath15.@xcite that success not only highlights the unconventional interplay of strong correlations and phonons in these systems : it also brings expanded alkali - doped fullerenes at the forefront of the strongly - correlated electron systems and superconductors , where good understanding of one model system may help shed more light on the entire highly controversial field .    in search for higher transition temperatures , earlier approaches toward expanded unit cells",

    "the high crystal symmetry prevents ordering of the @xmath1 molecular orbitals , i.e. it is believed that cubic @xmath24 are in an orbitally liquid state,@xcite at least above the antiferromagnetic nel temperature . in the non - cubic fullerides , however , one expects that crystal field will select a particular cage distortion and thus would also affect the inter - fulleride hopping integrals .",
    "since ma molecule is rather large compared to available octahedral space in the fulleride structure a strong interaction - presumably even the formation of a weak hydrogen bond - between ma - k@xmath6 group and the nearest was proposed.@xcite thus offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of symmetry breaking on the jt effect in strongly - correlated electron systems .",
    "stimulated by these open issues we decided to carry out a systematic _ ab initio _ study of by the density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) , where even if strong correlations are treated only at the mean - field level , the detailed chemical bonding and crystal - field strengths can be assessed .",

    "all three wannier orbitals are positioned on the central molecule and have a similar spread of @xmath28  nm . the projected dos ( pdos ) on the three wannier orbitals were evaluated using the gaussian smearing method with a  temperature \" parameter of 8  mev .",
    "the use of two different methods for evaluation of dos and pdos gives rise to a slight mismatch between the two .",
    "the mismatch does not affect the conclusions of this work .",
    "the compound grows in the face - centered orthorhombic ( space group _ fmmm _ ) crystal structure with the room - temperature unit - cell parameters : @xmath29   , @xmath30    and @xmath31    ( @xmath32  @xmath33).@xcite the ma - k@xmath6 groups situated only in the large octahedral sites were found to be dynamically disordered between eight equivalent orientations at high temperatures.@xcite below the structural phase transition at @xmath34  k ma - k@xmath6 groups become static and probably ordered in an ( anti)ferro - orientational order similar to .@xcite since the details of the low temperature structure are not known yet we base all our band - structure calculations on the experimental room - temperature structure .",
    "we select a single ma - k@xmath6 orientation thus effectively imposing a ferro - orientational order of the ma - k@xmath6 groups .",
    "the three metallic @xmath1 bands are well isolated from other molecular orbital - derived bands as is the case with every fullerene compound.@xcite the band gap between  homo \" ( @xmath35-derived bands ) and  lumo \" ( @xmath1-derived bands ) is 0.96  ev , while the separation between  lumo \" and  lumo+1 \" ( @xmath36-derived bands ) is 0.59  ev .",
    "for comparison we refer here to the corresponding gaps of 1.16  ev and 0.38  ev computed for cubic , @xcite and to the experimental values , roughly 1.8  ev and 1  ev respectively.@xcite the underestimation of the band gaps , standard for lda calculations , is fortunately of little consequence in our case .",
    "the neat separation of the different band groups allows us to focus entirely on @xmath1-derived bands close to the fermi energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , bare dft - lda nonmagnetic calculations yield for a metallic ground state with a half - filled @xmath1 band .",
    "however , several experiments proved that is an insulator,@xcite clearly suggesting that the mean - field dft metallic state is driven to mott - hubbard insulating state by electron correlations . since the phase diagram for non - cubic fullerides has already been calculated within dmft with included electron correlations , it is sufficient at this stage to continue the characterization of in the non - correlated limit and then treat electron correlations , e.g. within the established msdt phase diagram.@xcite    orthorhombic crystal symmetry is reflected in the band - structure [ fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) ] by ( i ) the removal of the threefold degeneracy at the @xmath2 point [ fig .",
    "[ fig-1](b ) ] ; and ( ii ) the inequivalence of y and x points . at the @xmath2 point",
    "we compute an energy splitting between the first and the second and between the second and the third @xmath1 energy levels of @xmath37  mev and @xmath38  mev , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding energy splittings for are @xmath39  mev and @xmath40  ev.@xcite in general , @xmath22 reflects the major orthorhombic crystal - field anisotropy and @xmath41 tracks the smaller anisotropy in the @xmath42 plane .",
    "surprisingly , band - structure anisotropies of the two systems are very much comparable despite some obvious crystallographic differences , like for instance the ratio @xmath21 , which is 0.89 and 0.91 for and , respectively . in order to position on the msdt fulleride @xmath43 phase diagram",
    "we need to evaluate @xmath12 , which is deduced directly from the computed band - structure . the resulting total @xmath1 density of states ( dos ) , roughly shaped in three peaks , and shown in fig .  [ fig-1](a ) resembles that of .@xcite we note that the apparent disagreement between dos s width and the band - structure splitting at the x point is due to very a small number of states at extreme values and it can thus be seen only in the zoomed view for small dos values .",
    "we obtain a quite large dos at the fermi energy , @xmath44  states / ev/ , which is a result of expanded lattice structure and the resulting smaller bandwidth @xmath45  ev . for comparison , we refer here to the @xmath46  ev reported for and , which are characterized by smaller unit cells.@xcite    the above results bring forward two interesting aspects of the ma co - intercalation .",
    "the first is the position of on the msdt @xmath43 phase diagram .",
    "manini  _ _ et .  al.__@xcite used @xmath47 as a measure of the anisotropy , which also defines the distance to the mit boundary in non - cubic fullerides .",
    "based on @xmath48 is quite close to both 2- and 3- band metallic phases .",
    "it is thus expected that under pressure would almost instantly end up in one of these two metallic states .",
    "we find to be slightly more anisotropic , judging from @xmath49 , thus deeper in the mott - insulating phase and further away from the 3-band metallic phase ( fig .  [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "application of a hydrostatic pressure , a standard experimental method for increasing @xmath12 and thus pushing systems across the metal - insulator boundary , has yet to be tried in this system to verify our calculations .",
    "however , based on the above observation , we predict that larger pressures will be needed in to access metallic and possibly superconducting states . to estimate the required metal - insulator transition pressure in we compute the bandwidth as a function of decreasing unit - cell volume , mimicking the effect of an external pressure .",
    "the pressure dependence of the unit - cell parameters was taken from the high - resolution x - ray data measured under hydrostatic conditions.@xcite to prevent unphysical contact between and ma groups we carried out a structural optimization for each volume .",
    "the bandwidth increases monotonically with decreasing unit - cell volume , or increasing pressure , with the slope of @xmath50  mev / gpa ( inset fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "if the effect of pressure could be reduced only to a pressure dependence of @xmath12 , we would predict a steep increase of @xmath19 in the insulating phase as a function of pressure , estimating for instance @xmath19(1  gpa)/@xmath19(0 ) @xmath20 @xmath51 . at higher pressures insulator - metal instability",
    "is expected to occur .",
    "if we take critical ratio @xmath52 as appropriate for the orthorhombic structure@xcite and a typical value for fullerenes @xmath53  ev,@xcite we predict that this transition should take place at around @xmath54  gpa .",
    "nonlinear effects on compressibility may push this critical pressure slightly higher .    contrasted with the metal - insulator transition , magnetic ordering",
    "can not be understood purely in terms of overall properties such as the bandwidth or crystal - field anisotropy .",
    "in particular , the abnormally small @xmath19 = 11  k of as compared with @xmath19 = 40  k for can hardly be justified by the fairly small differences either in the bandwidth or in the orthorhombic anisotropy .",
    "accordingly , the lattice expansion alone can not explain the small @xmath19 : the antiferromagnetic ordering must be controlled by other degrees of freedom such as the interaction between co - intercaland molecules and anions and the related stabilization of a particular jt deformation .",
    "we will test this hypothesis in the following sections .",
    "let us focus first on jt effect of anion , which has been predicted@xcite but has been experimentally much more elusive in fullerene systems.@xcite orthorhombic crystal structures should provide a fertile ground for jt effect investigations . in order to isolate jt effect we consider an artificial enlarged face centered orthorhombic structure using the room - temperature lattice parameters multiplied by a factor of 1.5 . to ensure charge neutrality ,",
    "we add a uniform positive background in the dft calculation .",
    "this positive background is not contributing to the orthorhombic crystal field , therefore any removal of @xmath1 degeneracy at the @xmath2 point should arise solely from the jt effect on top of the weak residual crystal field from the periodically replicated ions .",
    "the positions of carbon atoms were relaxed in order to obtain molecular distortions .",
    "the ion deforms spontaneously into a structure with @xmath55 symmetry [ fig .",
    "[ fig-3](a ) ] .",
    "this is the expected symmetry for @xmath56 jt coupling involving @xmath57 vibrational modes.@xcite distortions are small with the maximum value of 2  pm .",
    "we estimate the energy scale for deformation by realizing that the relaxed structure has @xmath58  mev lower total energy than the starting structure with undistorted icosahedral .",
    "former threefold @xmath1 degeneracy of the lumo is now removed , with @xmath1 levels split equally by @xmath2050 mev .",
    "the lowest @xmath1 orbital is doubly occupied , while the third electron goes into the central @xmath1 orbital , pinned at the fermi level .",
    "the highest @xmath1 orbital is empty .",
    "the total energy difference , @xmath59 , has several contributions : the jt effect , the crystal - field effect and bond - length correction due to lda approximation . to estimate only the jt energy scale we compare the above @xmath59 with the one obtained for a structural relaxation with equal and fixed occupations of the @xmath1 bands , which effectively hinders the jt effect .",
    "the difference in the total energy between these two calculations is 57  mev , a typical value for the jt effect.@xcite proper energy scale , typical size of deformations , the right symmetry of the splitting and occupation of @xmath1 orbitals are strong indications that the observed distortion is indeed a result of the jt effect .    the residual crystal field of ions is immediately seen for smaller lattice parameters , i.e. when room - temperature lattice parameters are for instance multiplied by a smaller factor of 1.25 . using the same procedure as above",
    ", the structural relaxation ended up with the same deformation of the molecule .",
    "the only difference is that the axis of jt deformation accidentally rotated from the crystal @xmath60- to @xmath61-direction .",
    "this indicates that we are dealing in both cases with the jt effect and that the change in the jt deformation axis is due to the existence of several equivalent minima of the lowest jt adiabatic potential energy surface ( apes).@xcite these minima become nearly degenerate for large lattice expansions .",
    "on the other hand , when lattice parameters are reduced down toward experimental values the orthorhombic crystal field starts to play a role by making some of the apes minima deeper , thus promoting one specific jt deformation .    adding potassium atoms to the structure results in an artificial orthorhombic where even stronger orthorhombic crystal field due to the close contact between the k@xmath6 and ions are expected .",
    "the structural optimization of the carbon positions when starting from the jt distorted atomic positions [ fig .",
    "[ fig-3](a ) ] leads to deformations of the molecule shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-3](b ) .",
    "molecular deformations are slightly different because the crystal field additionally lifts the @xmath1 degeneracy , hence producing pseudo - jt effect .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting symmetry remains @xmath62 and the maximal distortions of 2.3  pm are similar to the previous cases . the same holds for the total - energy lowering , @xmath63  mev .",
    "the jt effect is obviously still dominant over orthorhombic crystal field , which represents a smaller contribution to the total energy .",
    "the important message of this part is thus that the energy scale of the jt effect is @xmath64  mev and that for the experimental unit - cell volumes a comparably weak crystal field favors a particular pseudo - jt deformation .",
    "in the structure , methyl protons of the ma - k@xmath6 groups approach anions to very short distances and , based on this observation , suggestions about the weak hydrogen bond were formulated in the literature.@xcite such close contacts are expected to lead to rather strong crystal fields and , according to the above discussion , to also affect strongly the pseudo - jt effect .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear which of the two effects is dominant in this structure .",
    "therefore , deformations are now investigated in the room - temperature structure where only carbon atoms are allowed to relax . as expected",
    ", the presence of ma molecules has a dramatic effect on the shape [ fig .",
    "[ fig-4](a ) ] .",
    "the maximal cage distortions are significantly larger than in the previous cases - they reach up to 3.4  pm and the total energy is reduced by @xmath65  mev during the structural optimization .",
    "in addition , even the @xmath62 symmetry of the distorted molecule is lost .",
    "the maximal distortions are found for carbons facing methyl protons , at a closest - approach distance of 226  pm .",
    "dramatically larger distortions compared to those obtained for or even for orthorhombic structure indicate that the additional crystal field produced by ma - k@xmath6 groups plays a dominant role over the jt effect in .",
    "we also address the possible hydrogen - bond formation by relaxing all atomic positions , including those of ma - k@xmath6 groups .",
    "hydrogen - bond traces can be detected on the tiny deformation of ma where c - h bond lengths of the group are 110.3  pm , 110.4  pm and 110.6  pm , the last one corresponding to the hydrogen with the closest contact to the fullerene molecule .",
    "however , with the structural relaxation , the ma - k@xmath6 group rotates slightly away from the fullerene molecule , increasing the nearest h- distance to 228.5  pm , i.e. by 2.7  pm longer than in the experimental structure [ fig .",
    "[ fig-4](b ) ] .",
    "this distance still remains in the typical hydrogen - bond length range , but the  methyl proton contact elongation indicates that such bond must be very weak , if it exists at all .",
    "the above analyses point toward pseudo - jt effect and strong crystal fields in the arising from the ma- interactions .",
    "the remaining question to be addressed is how these effects influence the low - temperature magnetic properties .",
    "the appropriate starting point is to construct an effective tight - binding model for the @xmath1 bands and then relate the transfer integrals to the exchange coupling constants .",
    "to do so , we proceed by switching to the maximally - localized wannier orbitals ( wo).@xcite setting the energy window to the range around the dft @xmath1 band ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) we obtain three wos , each one localized on the same molecule . close to the fullerene cage , a typical wo ( fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] ) has the characteristic look of an appropriate combination of carbon @xmath66 orbitals.@xcite the orbital of fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] resembles the dft electron density obtained at the @xmath2 point .",
    "the distribution of @xmath66-like orbitals complies with the expected @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the other wos ( not shown ) have a similar shape , but different orientations .",
    "based on these wos , we compute their on - site energies and transfer integrals between neighboring from the kohn - sham hamiltonian as@xcite    @xmath67    here @xmath68 is a @xmath69-th wo and @xmath70 is a lattice translation vector . for @xmath71",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) gives the on - site wo energies and for @xmath72 eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) yields nine transfer integrals for each pair of neighboring molecules . by diagonalizing the tight - binding model",
    ", we verify that the obtained on - site energies and transfer integrals reproduce correctly the dft electronic band structure as shown by red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) .",
    "we note that the computed on - site tight - binding hamiltonian has non - zero off - diagonal elements , indicating hybridization within the obtained set of wos . by changing basis to an equivalent one where the on - site hamiltonian becomes diagonal , we derive a new set of wos with well - defined on - site energies .",
    "there are two indications that the new set of wos is appropriate for our purposes : ( i ) the new wos still reproduce band structure and ( ii ) in the mott - insulating limit such wos are a good approximation for the localized @xmath1 electronic orbitals with well - defined on - site energies , in our case separated by 32 and 67  mev .    to estimate the exchange coupling constants we focus only on the transfer integrals of the second wo , the half - filled one at intermediate energy .",
    "the neglect of the other ( inter - band ) hopping elements between neighboring sites amounts to neglecting inter - band transitions .",
    "this selection can be justified by noting that ( i ) the retained wo is mainly responsible for the dos at the fermi level [ see fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) ] and ( ii ) in a picture where the coulomb repulsion is the dominating interaction , the intermediate orbital hosts the unpaired spin in the spin-@xmath73 state of each molecular unit , with lower fully occupied and upper empty orbital . within this approximation",
    "we estimate the interfullerene exchange coupling constants with hubbard s expression @xmath74 , where we take @xmath53  ev . for the considered structure the strongest exchange couplings @xmath75  mev are found for nearest neighbors along the ( 0 1 1 ) and ( 1 0 -1 ) directions . we stress that these @xmath76 s are of the right order of magnitude as estimated from the measured curie - weiss temperature @xmath77  k.@xcite all other exchange constants are much weaker , not exceeding @xmath78 , see table  [ table-1 ] .",

    "low dimensionality could account for the reduced experimental nel temperature .",
    "however , although this is certainly a viable possibility , we stress that this conclusion is based on the high - temperature crystal structure . since we proved that the interaction between ma and is the governing factor for pseudo - jt effect , we stress at this point that the low - temperature exchange network may in fact be different .",
    "how sensitive interfullerene exchange interactions are on the precise position of ma - k@xmath6 groups becomes immediately evident when we consider relaxed dft structure with a slightly rotated ma - k@xmath6 groups [ fig .",
    "[ fig-4](b ) ] . for this structure",
    "the strongest exchange is @xmath79  mev , but now along ( 1 0 -1 ) .",
    "the quasi low - dimensional picture seems to still hold since the next two strongest interactions are much weaker , i.e. @xmath80 ( 0 1 -1 ) , and @xmath81 ( 1 -1 0 ) .",
    "all other exchange interactions are negligible ( table  [ table-1 ] ) .",
    "we stress that in all these structures the considered ma - k@xmath6 order is ferro - orientational . any deviation from this ma - k@xmath6 configuration , for example antiferro - orientational ma - k@xmath6 order as the candidate for the low - temperature structure , could significantly change the quasi low - dimensional character of our system . moreover ,",
    "if a certain degree of disorder in ma - k@xmath6 orientations is present , then one would anticipate also a distribution of exchange coupling constants , and an even smaller ordered moment .",
    "that would explain the static magnetic order with a broad - local - field distribution measured by @xmath82sr.@xcite this situation is somehow reminiscent of ferromagnetic tdae- , where disorder in jt deformations has been argued to be responsible for the reduced order parameter@xcite and broad distribution of local magnetic fields also measured in @xmath82sr experiment , for instance.@xcite we conclude that pseudo - jt orientation is an essential factor in interfullerene exchange coupling in .",
    "judging from the experimental high - temperature structure , may even show low - dimensionality effects thus explaining the reduced @xmath19",
    ". however , other pseudo - jt orientations may be active at low temperatures and even suppression of @xmath19 due to the disorder effects can not be excluded at this stage .",
    "further progress in understanding of magnetic properties of would be possible only when the low - temperature crystalline structure of is known .",
    "antiferromagnetic mott - hubbard insulating had been studied by means of dft calculations .",
    "we found the pronounced orthorhombic crystal field anisotropy in the electronic structure and judging from @xmath49 should be deep in the insulating part of the phase diagram .",
    "comparisons between different orthorhombic structures demonstrate that the jt effect is present and that its energy is around 60  mev .",
    "however , the interaction between cointercalated ma molecules and anions is comparatively strong in , leading to a strong crystal field and pseudo - jt effect stabilized at @xmath20300  mev .",
    "the presence of strong pseudo - jt effect should be responsible for the suppression of @xmath19 .",
    "calculations based on the high - temperature structure with imposed ferro - orientational order of ma - k@xmath6 groups suggest low - dimensionality in magnetic exchange ; however other explanations such as a disorder in pseudo - jt can not be excluded at this stage . a similar interplay of mott and jt physics",
    "is believed to play an important role in the superconductivity of underdoped cuprates . in the present study",

    "<S> we study the electronic structure and magnetic interactions in methylamine - intercalated orthorhombic alkali - doped fullerene within the density functional theory . as in the simpler ammonia intercalated compound , </S>",

    "<S> w _ can not alone account for the abnormally low experimental nel temperature , @xmath3  k of the methylamine compound , compared to the much higher value @xmath4  k of the ammonia one . significant interactions between and are responsible for the stabilization of particular pseudo - jahn - teller fullerene - cage distortions and the ensuing low - spin @xmath5 state . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions also seem to affect the magnetic properties , as interfullerene exchange interactions depend on the relative orientation of pseudo - jahn - teller distortions of neighboring molecules . for the ferro - orientational order of -k@xmath6 groups we find an apparent reduced dimensionality in magnetic exchange interactions , which may explain the suppressed nel temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder in exchange interactions caused by orientational disorder of -k@xmath6 groups could further contribute to this suppression . </S>"
