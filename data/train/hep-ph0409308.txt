    "<S> alan white  @xcite reviewed his ideas on the critical pomeron and confinement , one of the implications being strong ( qcd ) production of @xmath6 and @xmath1 pairs at sufficiently high energy . </S>",
    "<S> at the same meeting i talked  @xcite on  </S>",
    "<S> double pomeron exchange from the isr to the ssc \" , referring to his prediction of  ... dramatic ... direct and strong @xmath6 and @xmath1 production by pomerons ... \" at the ssc . </S>",
    "<S> the ssc is not to be , but the lhc should have enough energy for this prediction to be well tested . a rule - of - thumb for the masses @xmath7 which can be excited in dpe is @xmath8 which is 100 gev at the tevatron but 700 gev at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> thus the lhc is comfortably into the region where strong production of vector boson pairs by pomerons should be manifest and could be dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> the tevatron has probably too low @xmath9 , but of course 100 gev is just a rule of thumb and not a sharp cut - off , and given that we begin to have data there it is certainly worth a look  @xcite .    in the first 200 pb@xmath10 of run 2 data </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath11 gev ) cdf has approximately 20 @xmath12 or @xmath1 candidates . </S>",
    "<S> this number is consistent with standard model expectations . </S>",
    "<S> forward ( high @xmath13 ) protons were not detectable with high efficiency @xmath14 acceptance , so a search for a diffractive signature can only use the associated hadron distributions for @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this study is underway ; some events look strikingly clean but it is too early to say whether there is any significance to this . a year from now we should have five times the data and a more sophisticated monte carlo study ( including the very forward region ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the tevatron data is inconclusive , the lhc should supply a definitive test .    </S>",
    "<S> the critical pomeron ( critical meaning intercept = 1.0 ) plays a key role in white s theory . </S>",
    "<S> it has two parts , a reggeized gluon and an infinite number of  wee gluons \" . in qcd </S>",
    "<S> a leading order @xmath16-scattering diagram by one - gluon exchange is  sick \" , not being gauge invariant . to meet </S>",
    "<S> this requirement one adds other gluon exchanges and sums them up in a particular way to give a gauge invariant sum , the reggeized gluon . </S>",
    "<S> this carries color and is not yet a pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> in the bfkl pomeron the color is neutralized by a second reggeized gluon linked to the first by the rungs of a ladder . in the  white pomeron \" </S>",
    "<S> the color is neutralized at large distance by a cloud of wee gluons , gluons that have no ( or very small ) momentum even in the infinite momentum frame . </S>",
    "<S> these wee gluons have the properties of the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> they are directly responsible for confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the theory and so , in a sense they _ are _ the vacuum .    </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic freedom must be saturated to obtain the critical pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> this would require 16 color - triplet quark flavors . of </S>",
    "<S> course we only know 6 ( d , u , s , c , b , t ) </S>",
    "<S> . however higher color sextet quarks would each count 5@xmath14 in this sum , so a pair of such @xmath17 s , say \\{@xmath18 } , will result in asymptotic freedom with the critical pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> the color sextet quarks @xmath17 have zero current mass , but a constituent mass at the electroweak scale , probably a few hundred gev . </S>",
    "<S> they have a stronger color charge than triplet quarks @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> they would have electric charge opposite to that of quarks , i.e. @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> they can form  superhadrons \" such as @xmath21 = [ @xmath22 and @xmath23 = [ @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 is probably the lightest superbaryon , hence stable , with a mass at the tev scale ( within a factor  2 ? ) , and would be a candidate for dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is strongly interacting ( a simp ) through diffractive processes , and could be a component of uhe cosmic rays detectable e.g. in auger . at low energies , way below the @xmath25 threshold , it behaves like a wimp . </S>",
    "<S> anomaly cancellation requires a pair of heavy lepton doublets \\{@xmath26 } and \\{@xmath27 } or some other lepton sector </S>",
    "<S> . the @xmath28 s would be another ( wimp ) component of dark matter .    </S>",
    "<S> supermesons are formed of [ @xmath25 ] giving e.g. \\{@xmath30 } and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the \\{@xmath30 } are composite zero - helicity components of \\{@xmath32 } ( they get  eaten \" by massless \\{@xmath32 } to give them their masses ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 plays the role of the higgs boson in electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> there is no  standard model \" higgs in this theory ! ( the @xmath31 has rather different properties . ) </S>",
    "<S> this form of symmetry breaking is similar , in some respects , to higher representation technicolor and , because of this , may be consistent with electroweak precision measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is that no new technicolor gauge fields are needed .    the wee gluon cloud in the pomeron couples particularly strongly to the color sextet quarks . </S>",
    "<S> their color charge is large and the number of gluons is large . and the color sextet quarks couple strongly to @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> once above the electroweak scale , and into the realm of @xmath17 s , there should be prolific diffractive production of @xmath33 . at uhe cosmic ray energies ( agasa , auger ) </S>",
    "<S> they may be produced almost like pions , with several in most events !    a diagram of @xmath6 pair production by dpe is shown in fig.[diag ] . </S>",
    "<S> fig 1b shows the striking @xmath34 vertex through a sextet quark loop ( fig 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this photoproduction of @xmath4 would make very high energy @xmath35 collisions very interesting ( ilc on a proton storage ring : tevatron , hera or lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> pomeron physics is difficult at an @xmath36 machine ; how much of this sector can be addressed at the ilc itself ( @xmath36 ) has to be assessed .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t ]    is there any evidence for the color sextet quark theory ? to those who consider dark matter evidence for susy it is also evidence for this theory which has dark matter candidates ! but of course we must first find dark matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> there are very significant anomalies in the rate of high @xmath2 jets (  cores \" ) in experiments such as chacaltaya and kanbala  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a qcd monte carlo was tuned to jet data at fixed target and collider energies ( including the @xmath37 and tevatron ) . </S>",
    "<S> for cosmic rays with energies above @xmath38 5 tev the jet rate for @xmath39 1000 tev.cm exceeds the data by an order of magnitude , where @xmath40 is basically the product of the jets @xmath2 and the jet - pair separation @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to occur between tevatron and lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> could these jets actually be high @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 ? </S>",
    "<S> there are also indications of an excess of jets at high @xmath2 in cdf data , but the situation is unclear as the systematic errors are large , and d0 does not seem to see the same effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is also in a region where poorly known large-@xmath42 gluons could be important . </S>",
    "<S> however there are ( at least ) two mechanisms giving such an excess in this theory </S>",
    "<S> . they might be anomalous ( strongly produced ) @xmath33 s , and this may be testable in existing data </S>",
    "<S> . they might be due to a slowing down of the running of @xmath43 as the scale @xmath44 approaches the ( non - perturbative ) @xmath17 scale . </S>",
    "<S> ( this @xmath43-slowing was actuallyseen \" in the cdf run - i data  @xcite _ under the assumption of the cteq4 m pdf_. ) however i want to emphasize that this possible jet excess , while intriguing , can not at this stage be considered as evidence for _ anything_. the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum around @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 gev is however very well established and not understood . in white s theory </S>",
    "<S> this is about the energy at which @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s start to be strongly pair produced , so the transverse profile of the atmospheric cascade broadens and more of the primary energy goes into neutrinos , both effects leading to an underestimate of the primary energy and hence a steepening of the spectrum  @xcite .    even though the tevatron is probably at too low @xmath9 to see evidence for the white pomeron and its effects , </S>",
    "<S> i believe it is worth looking . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold would not be a @xmath47-function . </S>",
    "<S> so far we have looked at only 200 pb@xmath10 for @xmath48 and do not see a significant anomaly , though there are some intriguing events . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately we do not have precision roman pots ( on both outgoing beams and with good acceptance ) to tag the @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> if we did one could even look for @xmath51 through missing mass , measure @xmath52 etc . </S>",
    "<S> technically it would be possible to install such pots , and we looked into it , but it would require a few month shut - down , cost @xmath53 $ 0.6 m and disturb the machine , so it would require a very strong case ( 5@xmath54 signal ? ) </S>",
    "<S> . however lhc should be with us in 4 years , and cms and perhaps atlas will have the ability to see the diffractively scattered protons in @xmath6 and @xmath1 events . </S>",
    "<S> if  white is right \" there will be dramatic effects . </S>"
