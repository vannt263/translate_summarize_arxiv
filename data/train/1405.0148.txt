    "considering the importance of heat kernels in riemannian geometry , it appears very natural to investigate the links between geometry and asymptotics of brownian paths in a lorentzian setting . extending dudley",
    "s seminal work @xcite , j. franchi and y. le jan constructed in @xcite , on the unitary tangent bundle @xmath0 of an arbitrary lorentz manifold @xmath1 , a diffusion process which is lorentz - covariant .",
    "this process , that we will simply call _ relativistic diffusion _ in the sequel , is the lorentzian analogue of the classical brownian motion on a riemannian manifold .",
    "it can be seen either as a random perturbation of the timelike geodesic flow on the unitary tangent bundle , or as a stochastic development of dudley s diffusion in a fixed tangent space .    in minkowski space - time , and more generally in lorentz manifolds of constant curvature , the long - time asymptotics of the relativistic diffusion is well understood , see @xcite .",
    "but , as in the riemannian case , there is no hope to fully determinate the asymptotic behavior of the relativistic diffusion on an arbitrary lorentzian manifold : it could depend heavily on the base space , see e.g. @xcite and its references in the `` simple '' case of cartan  hadamard manifolds .",
    "recently in @xcite , we studied in details the long - time asymptotic behavior of the relativistic diffusion in the case when the underlying space - time belong to a large class of curved lorentz manifolds : robertson - walker space - times , or rw space - times for short , whose definition is recalled in sect .",
    "[ sec.rw ] below .",
    "we show in particular that the relativistic diffusion s paths converge almost surely to random points of a natural geometric compactification of the base manifold @xmath1 , namely its causal boundary @xmath2 introduced in the reference @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a rw space - time , @xmath3 and let @xmath4 be the relativistic diffusion starting from @xmath5 .",
    "then , almost surely as @xmath6 goes to the explosion time @xmath7 of the diffusion , the first projection @xmath8 converges to a random point @xmath9 of the causal boundary @xmath2 of @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to push the analysis further by showing that , in the case of a rw space - time with exponential growth , the poisson boundary of the diffusion is precisely generated by the single random variable @xmath9 of the causal boundary @xmath2 , which in that case can be identified with a spacelike copy of the euclidean space @xmath10 ( see @xcite and theorem 4.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "namely , we have :    let @xmath11 be a rw space - time where @xmath12 has exponential growth .",
    "let @xmath13 be the relativistic diffusion starting from @xmath3 . then , almost surely as @xmath6 goes to infinity , the process @xmath14 converges to a random point @xmath15 in @xmath10 , and the invariant sigma field of the whole diffusion @xmath16 coincides almost surely with @xmath17 .",
    "the above result is the first computation of the poisson boundary of the relativistic diffusion in the case of a lorentz manifold with non - constant curvature .",
    "it can be seen as a complementary result of those of @xcite in the flat cases .",
    "the difficulty here lies in the following facts : classical coupling techniques are hardly implemented in hypoelliptic settings , classical lie group methods or explicit conditionning ( doob transform ) do not apply in the presence of curvature .",
    "our approach is purely probabilistic , it is first based on the existence of natural subdiffusions due to symmetries of the base manifold , namely the processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are subdiffusions of the whole process . using successive shift - couplings , we then show that the poisson boundaries of these two subdiffusions are trivial .",
    "finally , we conclude via an abstract conditionning argument , allowing us to show that the invariant sigma field of the whole diffusion is indeed generated by the invariant sigma field of the subdiffusion @xmath19 and the single extra information @xmath17 .",
    "this last argument is new and non - trivial , it takes into account the hypoellipticity of the infinitesimal generator of the relativistic diffusion and it s equivariance with respect to euclidean spatial translations of the base space .",
    "it is actually the starting point of the very recent work @xcite in collaboration with c. tardif , where our main motivation is to exhibit a general setting and some natural conditions that allow to compute the poisson boundary of a diffusion starting from the poisson boundary of a subdiffusion .",
    "it is interesting to note that the resulting devissage method can be used to recover bailleul s result @xcite in a more direct way , see section 4.2 of @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the first section",
    ", we briefly recall the geometrical background on rw space - times and the definition of the relativistic diffusion in this setting . in section [ sec.results ]",
    ", we then state our results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the relativistic diffusion and its poisson boundary .",
    "the last section is dedicated to the proofs of these results . for the sake of self - containedness and in order to provide an easily readable article , some results of @xcite and their proofs are recalled here .",
    "[ sec.background ] the lorentz manifolds we consider here are rw space - times .",
    "they are the natural geometric framework to formulate the theory of big - bang in general relativity theory .",
    "the constraint that a space - time satisfies both einstein s equations and the cosmological principle implies it has a warped product structure , see e.g. @xcite p. 395404 . a rw space - time , classically denoted by @xmath20 ,",
    "is thus defined as a cartesian product of a open real interval @xmath21 ( the base ) and a 3-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath22 of constant curvature ( the fiber ) , endowed with a lorentz metric of the following form @xmath23 where @xmath12 is a positive function on @xmath24 , called the _",
    "expansion function_. classical examples of rw space - times are the ( half)@xmath25minkowski space - time , einstein static universe , de sitter and anti - de sitter space - times etc .",
    "a detailed study of the relativistic diffusion in a general rw space - time has been led in @xcite where we characterized the almost - sure long - time behavior of the diffusion .",
    "we focus here on the case when the real interval @xmath24 is unbounded and the riemannian fiber is euclidean , see remark [ rem.courb ] below .",
    "namely , we consider rw space - times @xmath26 , where the expansion function @xmath12 satisfies the following hypotheses :    1 .",
    "the function @xmath12 is of class @xmath27 on @xmath28 and it is increasing and @xmath29concave , _ i.e. _ the hubble function @xmath30 is non - negative and non - increasing .",
    "2 .   the function @xmath12 has exponential growth , _",
    "i.e. _ the limit @xmath31 is positive .",
    "[ rem.courb ] the hypothesis of log - concavity of the expansion function is classical , it appears natural from both physical @xcite and mathematical points of view @xcite .",
    "note also that we are working in dimension @xmath32 because physically relevent space - times have dimension 4 , but our results apply verbatim in dimension @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "finally , as noticed in remark 3.5 of @xcite , in a rw space - time @xmath20 , if the expansion is exponential ( the inverse of @xmath12 is thus integrable at infinity ) , whatever the curvature of the riemannian manifold @xmath35 , the process @xmath36 asymptotically describes a recurrent time - changed spherical brownian motion in the limit unitary tangent space , i.e. it does not  see \" the curvature @xmath35 , that is why we concentrate here on the case @xmath37 .    a rw space - time",
    "@xmath26 is naturally endowed with a global chart @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the canonical coordinates in @xmath10 . at a point @xmath40 ,",
    "the scalar curvature is given by @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , although spatially flat , such a space - time is not globally flat in general . in the case of a `` true '' exponential expansion ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath42 for a positive constant @xmath43 , the space - time @xmath26 is an einstein manifold : its ricci tensor is proportional to its metric .    on a general lorentzian manifold @xmath1 ,",
    "the sample paths @xmath44 of the relativistic diffusion introduced in @xcite are time - like curves that are future - directed and parametrized by the arc length @xmath6 so that the diffusion actually lives on the positive part of the unitary tangent bundle of the manifold , that we denote by @xmath45 .",
    "the infinitesimal generator of the diffusion is the following hypoelliptic operator @xmath46 where @xmath47 generates the geodesic flow on @xmath0 , @xmath48 is the vertical laplacian , and @xmath49 is a real parameter .",
    "equivalently , if @xmath50 is a local chart on @xmath1 and if @xmath51 are the usual christoffel symbols , the relativistic diffusion is the solution of the following system of stochastic differential equations , for @xmath52 : @xmath53 where the brakets of the martingales @xmath54 are given by @xmath55    in the case of a rw space - time of the form @xmath26 endowed with its natural global chart , the metric is @xmath56 , and the only non vanishing christoffel symbols are @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in the case of a spatially flat rw space - time , the system of stochastic differential equations ( [ eqn.flj ] ) that defines the relativistic diffusion simply reads : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denote the usual euclidean norm of @xmath62 in @xmath10 and the brackets satisfy @xmath63 moreover , the parameter @xmath6 being the arc length , we have the pseudo - norm relation : @xmath64    [ rem.pseudo ] the sample paths being future - directed , from the above pseudo - norm relation , we have obviously @xmath65 , in particular as long as it is well defined , the  time \" process @xmath66 is a strictly increasing and we have @xmath67 .",
    "we can now state our results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the relativistic diffusion and its poisson boundary in a spatially flat and fast expanding rw space - time .",
    "for the sake of clarity , the proofs of these different results are postponed in section [ sec.proofs ] . for the whole section , let us thus fix a spatially flat rw space - time @xmath26 , where @xmath12 satisfies the hypotheses stated in sect .",
    "[ sec.rw ] .      naturally , the first thing to do is to ensure that the system of stochastic differential equations ( [ eqn.flj.eucli ] ) admits a solution , and possibly to exhibit lower dimensional subdiffusions that will facilitate its study .",
    "this is the object of the following proposition .",
    "[ pro.exiuni ] for any @xmath68 , the system of stochastic differential equations ( [ eqn.flj.eucli ] ) admits a unique strong solution @xmath69 starting from @xmath70 , which is well defined for all positive proper times @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , this solution admits the two following subdiffusions of dimension two and four respectively : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "given a point @xmath73 , we will denote by @xmath74 the law of the relativistic diffusion starting from @xmath75 and by @xmath76 the associated expectation .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the word `` almost surely '' will mean @xmath77almost surely .",
    "the two above subdiffusions will be called the _ temporal _ and _ spherical _ diffusions respectively .      as conjectured in @xcite",
    ", we show that the relativistic diffusion asymptotically behaves like light rays , _",
    "i.e. _ light - like geodesics . indeed , from remark [ rem.pseudo ]",
    ", we know that the first projection @xmath66 of the ( non - markovian ) process @xmath78 goes almost - surely to infinity with @xmath6 . we shall prove that its spatial part @xmath14 converges almost surely to a random point @xmath15 in @xmath10 , so that the diffusion asymptotically follows a line @xmath79 in @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig.asymp ] below , which is the typical behavior of a light - like geodesic .",
    "moreover , we shall see that the normalized derivative @xmath36 is recurrent so that the curve @xmath80 actually winds along the line @xmath79 in a recurrent way .",
    "# 1#2#3#4#5 @font    to state precise results , let us introduce the following notations . given two positive constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,",
    "let @xmath83 be the probability measure on @xmath84 admitting the following density with respect to lebesgue measure : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the normalizing constant .",
    "if @xmath87 , we will write @xmath88 the following theorem summarizes the almost sure asymptotics of the relativistic diffusion , its proofs is given in sect .",
    "[ sec.proofasymp ] below .",
    "[ the.asymp ] let @xmath89 , and let @xmath69 be the relativistic diffusion starting from @xmath70 .",
    "then as @xmath6 goes to infinity , we have the following almost sure asymptotics :    1 .",
    "the non - markovian process @xmath90 is harris - recurrent in @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath92 is a monotone , @xmath93integrable function , or if it is bounded and continuous : @xmath94 in particular , @xmath95 .",
    "the spatial projection @xmath14 converges almost surely to a random point @xmath15 in @xmath10 .",
    "3 .   the normalized spatial derivative @xmath96 is a time - changed brownian motion on the sphere @xmath97 , in particular it is recurrent .",
    "as noticed in the introduction , the above asymptotic results can be rephrased concisely thanks to the notion of causal boundary introduced in @xcite .",
    "in fact , in a fast expanding rw space - time @xmath26 , the causal boundary @xmath2 identifies with a spacelike copy of @xmath10 : a causal curve @xmath98 converges to a point @xmath99 iff @xmath100 and @xmath101 , see @xcite .",
    "we now describe the poisson boundary of the relativistic diffusion , that is we determine its invariant sigma field @xmath102 or equivalently the set of bounded harmonic functions with respect to its infinitesimal generator @xmath103 .",
    "owing to theorem [ the.asymp ] , the processes @xmath90 and @xmath36 being recurrent , it is tempting to assert that the only non trivial asymptotic variable associated to the relativistic diffusion is the random point @xmath104 . nevertheless , the result is far from being trivial because some extra - information relating the temporal components and the spatial ones could be hidden .",
    "for example , in minkowski space - time i.e. if @xmath105 , we have almost surely @xmath106 and @xmath107 , but the poisson boundary of the relativistic diffusion is not reduced to the sigma algebra @xmath108 because the difference @xmath109 converges almost - surely to a random variable that is not measurable with respect to @xmath108 .    using shift - coupling techniques ,",
    "we first prove in sect .",
    "[ sec.proofpoisson ] ( propositions [ pro.poissontemp ] and [ pro.poissonspatial ] ) that the invariant sigma fields of the temporal and spherical subdiffusions are indeed trivial . then , taking into account the regularity of harmonic functions ( hypoellipticity ) , and using the equivariance of infinitesimal generator under euclidean translations , we construct an abstract conditionning ( proposition [ pro.poisson ] ) to end up with the following result :    [ the.poisson ] let @xmath11 be a rw space - time where @xmath12 has exponential growth .",
    "let @xmath89 and let @xmath69 be the relativistic diffusion starting from @xmath70 .",
    "then , the invariant sigma field @xmath102 of the whole diffusion coincides with the sigma field generated by the single variable @xmath104 up to @xmath110negligeable sets .",
    "equivalently , if @xmath111 is a bounded @xmath112harmonic function on @xmath45 , there exists a bounded measurable function @xmath113 on @xmath10 , such that @xmath114 , \\ ; \\ ; \\forall ( \\xi , \\dot{\\xi } ) \\in   t^1_+ \\mathcal m.\\ ] ]    in other words , all the asymptotic information on the relativistic diffusion is encoded in the point @xmath104 or equivalently in the point @xmath115 of the causal boundary @xmath2 .",
    "the above theorem is thus very similar to theorem 1 of @xcite asserting that the invariant sigma field of the relativistic diffusion in minkowski space - time is generated by a random point on its causal boundary , which in that case identifies with the product @xmath116 .",
    "it is tempting to ask if such a link between the poisson and causal boundary holds in a more general context .",
