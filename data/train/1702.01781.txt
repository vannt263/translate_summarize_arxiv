    "this result is intriguing as the complexity of the spin dynamics near the critical point does not smooth the way for an intuitive picture of the transition in terms of geometric spin phases .",

    "we show that the topological characteristics of the guiding field have striking consequences on the spin resonance condition , leading to a definite inflection of the bloch - siegert shift@xcite at the critical point where the field undergoes a topological transition .",
    "we therefore propose corresponding resonance experiments as a proof of concept for topological transitions in the dynamics of spins or any other two - level system as , e.g. , strongly - driven superconducting qubits .",
    "this approach has the advantage to overcome the difficulties present in spin - carrier implementations as those arising from disorder , multichannel transport and dephasing in hybrid spin - orbit / magnetic textures .",
