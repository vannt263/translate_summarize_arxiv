    "the creep of concrete is generally thought to be mainly caused by the viscoelastic and viscoplastic behavior of the cement hydrates @xcite . while secondary cementitious phases can show viscoelastic behavior @xcite , the rate and extent of viscoelastic deformations of such phases is far less significant than that calcium  silicate ",

    "a minimization of the energy is performed , with the system having the ability to deform ( shape and volume ) in order to reach the target stress .",

    "when subjected to shear stresses of different intensities , c  s  h presents a shear strain @xmath7 that : ( 1 ) increases logarithmically with the number of cycles @xmath8 ( figure [ fig : method ] ) and ( 2 ) is proportional to the applied shear stress ( see figure [ fig : strain ] ) .",

    "the creep of bulk c  s  h can then be described by a simple logarithmic law @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a constant analogous to a relaxation time and @xmath9 is the creep modulus",
    ". a careful look at the internal energy shows that the height of the energy barriers , through which the system transits across each cycle , remains roughly constant over successive cycles . according to transition state theory , which states that the time needed for a system to jump over an energy barrier @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 , we can assume that each cycle corresponds to a constant duration @xmath16 , so that a fictitious time can be defined as @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "as shown in the inset of figure [ fig : strain ] , we observe an excellent agreement , which suggests that the present method offers a realistic description of the creep of c  s  h at the atomic scale .",
    "this result also suggests that , within the linear regime ( i.e. , for sub - yield stresses , when @xmath9 remain constant ) , deformations due to cyclic creep and basic creep , with respect to the number of stress cycle or the elapsed time , respectively , should be equivalent .",
