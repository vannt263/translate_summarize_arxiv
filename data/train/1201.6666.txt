    "there is a significant amount of scientific literature dedicated to the topic with different types of the plate - patch attachment being considered . in particular , the plate and the patches can be attached to each other using adhesive applied along parts of their surfaces ( two - dimensional ) or along some contours ( one - dimensional ) , or only at certain point by using rivets .",

    ", a patch repair of multiple holes in a plate by multiple patches of arbitrary shapes has not been a subject of many studies with an exception of @xcite .    in this paper , a reinforcement of a plate with multiple holes with several patches",
    "is considered for two types of the plate - patch attachment : only along the boundary of the patch or along both the boundary of the patch and the boundaries of the holes covered by the patch .",
    "it is assumed that the patch is loaded with in - plane stresses applied to the free unattached boundaries of the holes and at infinity point of the plate .",
    "the location , the quantity and the shape of the patches can be arbitrary with the only condition that the boundaries of the patches and the holes are smooth and do not touch each other or intersect .",
    "the complex analysis methods are used to solve the problem .",
    "first , the muskhelishvili s formulas @xcite are used to describe the stresses and the displacements in the plate and the patches through the complex potentials in the plate and the patches .",
    "the singular integral representations of the complex potentials are used then to reformulate the problem as a system of singular integral equations .",
    "these representations were first proposed by savruk @xcite to study the problems for cracked plates .",
    "the uniqueness of the solution of the resulting system of the singular integral equations can be proved in a manner similar to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the method of mechanical quadratures applied for the solution of similar systems in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is difficult to implement for a large number of contours due to decreasing precision .",
    "the idea behind the method proposed here is in the approximation of the unknown functions by trigonometric polynomials .",
    "substituting these approximations into the system of singular integral equations reduces this system to the system of linear algebraic equations for the coefficients of the trigonometric polynomials .",

    "this means that the displacements are equal both in the patch and the plate from both sides of the junction lines and the stress equilibrium conditions are satisfied on the junction lines .",

    "first , consider the infinite plate @xmath0 with the holes @xmath1 which is subjected to the given in - plane stresses at infinity and on the lines @xmath1 , @xmath9 .",
    "the stresses in the plate @xmath0 have a jump discontinuity on the curve @xmath43 lying in the interior of the plate , and the displacements are continuous on these curves : @xmath44 extend formally the plate @xmath0 to the full complex plane so that the stresses are continuous through the curve @xmath45 and the derivatives of the displacements have a jump discontinuity along this line : @xmath46 then the complex potentials @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be taken in the form @xcite : + @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the arbitrarily fixed point inside of the contour @xmath7 .    formally extend each patch @xmath3 , @xmath6 , to the full complex plane so that outside of the patch all the displacements and the stresses are equal to zero .",
    "the displacements in the patch @xmath3 are continuous through the line @xmath54 , and the stresses have a jump discontinuity on this line : @xmath55 in the complex plane thus obtained from the patch @xmath3 the jump of the vector of the stresses @xmath56 acting on the tangent line to the contour @xmath5 is equal to @xmath57 , and the jump of the vector of the displacements @xmath29 is equal to @xmath58 : @xmath59 according to the condition ( [ 2.5 ] ) and the formula ( [ 3.2 ] ) we have @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",

    "adding these terms does not change the conditions ( [ 2.1])-([2.4 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) and provides that the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath104 @xmath105 from the physical viewpoint the condition ( [ 3.12 ] ) means that the displacements are single - valued in the plate along the contours @xmath7 , @xmath106 , while the condition ( [ 3.13 ] ) provides that the resultant force applied to the patch @xmath3 is equal to zero @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the system ( [ 3.8])-([3.11 ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "this is accomplished by reducing the system ( [ 3.8])-([3.11 ] ) to the system of fredholm equations and proving the uniqueness of the solution of the mechanical problem .",
    "this has been proved in details for the case of the plate with one hole reinforced by one patch in @xcite .",
    "the proof for the general case can be obtained using similar methods .",
    "in this section we present an alternative technique for solving the system of singular integral equations ( [ 3.8])-([3.11 ] ) .",
    "the method of mechanical quadratures presented to study the problems for cracked plates in @xcite and adopted for plates with holes reinforced by patches in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite provides a sufficient accuracy with a reasonable computational time for the systems of similar type in the cases when the number of contours @xmath1 and @xmath5 is small",
    ". however , the results become unsatisfactory both in the sense of accuracy and computational time if a larger number of contours is considered .",
    "another observed disadvantage of the method of mechanical quadratures is that the results obtained using this method tend to deteriorate significantly with the loss of the symmetry in the construction .    to overcome these disadvantages",
    "the following approach is proposed and shown to be computationally effective .",

    "next , approximate the unknown functions @xmath70 , @xmath76 , @xmath71 , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath110 , by the partial sums of the complex fourier series by the parameter @xmath111 : @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 are the unknown complex coefficients of the partial sums ( [ 3.14 ] ) which need to be found",
    ".    substituting the formulas ( [ 3.14 ] ) into the system ( [ 3.8])-([3.11 ] ) leads to the following equations : @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124,\\,\\,\\,j=1,\\ldots,4n+2m+r,\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the degree of the trigonometric polynomials ( [ 3.14 ] ) , and the functions @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 can be obtained from the system ( [ 3.8])-([3.11 ] ) .",
    "the integrals in these functions can be computed numerically by using any appropriate method .    the equations ( [ 3.15 ] ) , in general ,",
    "can not be satisfied for all the values of the parameter @xmath111 due to the approximation of the unknown functions by the truncated fourier series ( [ 3.14 ] ) .",
    "instead , we assume that the equations ( [ 3.15 ] ) are satisfied only in the finite number of points @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "this transforms ( [ 3.15 ] ) into the system of linear algebraic equations with real coefficients of the order @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the approximate solution of the system of singular integral equations ( [ 3.8])-([3.11 ] ) can be obtained by solving the system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "while the precise investigation of the convergence of the solution of the resulting system of linear algebraic equations to the solution of the system of singular integral equations ( [ 3.8])-([3.11 ] ) is outside of the scope of this paper , the numerical results obtained by using this method and also comparison with the numerical results obtained by the method of mechanical quadratures in @xcite suggests that even relatively small number of terms @xmath125 ( @xmath132 in most cases ) is sufficient to obtain a satisfactory convergence , thus , reducing the problem to the solution of a relatively small system of linear algebraic equations .",
