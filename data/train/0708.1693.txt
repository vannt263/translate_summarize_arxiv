    "it is instructive to discuss the reason why this is the case before proceeding with a discussion of the structure . in the bulk nsmo ,",
    "the changes in the lattice constants at the ferromagnetic transition are less than 0.2%@xcite . in contrast , those at the ce - oo transition amount to 1.4% , while the volumetric change is 0.1% @xcite .",

    "<S> the result shows , as expected based on previous knowledge of bulk materials , that the films resistivity is closely related to their structures . observed superlattice reflections indicate that nsmo thin films have an antiferro - orbital - ordered phase as their low - temperature phase while psmo film on lsat has a ferro - orbital - ordered phase , and that on sto has no orbital - ordered phase . </S>",
