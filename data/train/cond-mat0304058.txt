    "the purpose of this paper is to address the calculation of scattering amplitudes in systems exhibiting non - fermi liquid physics . in such systems ,",
    "scattering processes involving electrons ( more precisely , the quasiparticles adiabatically connected with the bare electrons in the landau fermi liquid theory , with charge @xmath5 and spin @xmath6 ) can give rise to the appearance of other kinds of quasiparticles .",
    "a characteristic example of this phenomenon ( to be discussed in details below ) occurs when electrons are injected from a fermi liquid into a luttinger liquid , and can give rise to various combinations of laughlin quasiparticles and quasiholes @xcite .",
    "another example occurs in the spin @xmath6 two channel kondo problem : at the low energy fixed point , the amplitude for an electron to be scattered into an electron ( or any finite combination of electrons and holes ) is actually zero , hence giving rise to ` unitarity puzzles ' , which are solved by recognizing that the scattering takes place entirely into the spinors sector @xcite .",
    "the determination of these amplitudes is conceptually a very important question , as one may argue they are the essence of non fermi liquids physics . technically however , it is a very difficult one , which has been tackled mostly in perturbation theory around the high energy fixed point @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to present some non perturbative attempts at calculating these amplitudes in a case where the problem is integrable - and especially simple .",
    "our initial attempts were based on the technique of form - factors @xcite , and this paper builds on earlier works in this area @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the answer to the physical questions of interest involves the determination of correlation functions in a massless field theory with a boundary interaction . in the paper @xcite",
    "it was shown that such correlation functions could be determined with remarkable accuracy in the case of operators with no anomalous dimension , like the current and the stress energy tensor . in the paper @xcite",
    ", preliminary attempts were made to determine similar correlators in the case of vertex operators with non trivial , anomalous dimensions . from a technical point of view , the present work is a follow up of that paper , and will use similar regularization techniques .",
    "it will turn out however that for the specific questions asked - for instance , what is the probability that an electron from a ( chiral ) fermi liquid tunnels into a ( chiral ) luttinger @xmath7 liquid as an edge electron , the form - factor results do not , in practice , give reliable results for all scales of energy .",
    "we will thus have to make considerable use of another non peturbative ( `` analytic '' ) approach pioneered by chatterjee and zamolodchikov @xcite to obtain what will turn out to be results in closed form .",
    "two main applications are presented : the problem of an impurity in a one dimensional luttinger liquid , and the problem of a point contact between a fermi liquid and a luttinger liquid .",
    "these two problems are related with the boundary sine - gordon model , with which we assume the reader to be familiar .",
    "mostly for technical reasons , we restrict in this paper to the case @xmath0 .",
    "although this is a `` free fermion theory '' , the amplitudes of interest involve operators which are not local in terms of the fermions , and whose correlators are already quite complex .",
    "the physical features are not expected to depend strongly on @xmath8 , so we expect our results to shed light on the general situation ; moreover , @xmath0 is of direct relevance to the case of a contact between a fermi liquid and a @xmath7 edge @xcite .    in the case of the impurity in a luttinger liquid , or , equivalently , tunneling between two identical chiral luttinger liquids ( section 2 ) , we discuss both the reflection and transmission amplitude for a single laughlin quasiparticle . in the case of tunneling between a chiral luttinger liquid and a fermi liquid ( section 3 )",
    ", we discuss the @xmath1 , the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 amplitudes . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the edge electron , which can also be considered as the bound state of three laughlin quasiparticles .      to conclude this introduction",
    ", we would like to point out that the mere questions we want to answer have to be defined very carefully , a task we do not completely undertake in this paper . indeed , in the massless theories we are discussing , there are ambiguities in the set of scattering states one uses as a `` physical basis '' . for the one dimensional fermi liquid , the choice of electrons and holes is canonical , but for general luttinger liquids , this is not so .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath4 case , a choice based on charges @xmath14 ( laughlin quasihole ) and @xmath15 ( edge electron ) quantas has been studied in great details @xcite .",
    "other choices , eg using charges @xmath14 and @xmath16 ( laughlin quasiparticle ) quantas , should be possible as well : none appears more fundamental than the other , but the choice has to be carefully specified whenever one discusses , for instance , unitarity .",
    "whatever the choice , the vertex operators ( in the bosonized formalism ) one uses as `` creation / annihilation '' operators of these quantas are not one particle operators in the usual sense .",
    "they do not simply add or subtract a single quasi - particle from a many particle state , but have a more complicated action due to their non trivial commutators .",
    "this can make the mere definition of a scattering amplitude quite non trivial @xcite .",
    "we consider a problem with two identical chiral luttinger liquids and tunneling between them induced by a gate voltage - the set up is represented on the figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath17,\\ ] ] where the fields @xmath18 are associated with each of the two luttinger liquids . by forming linear combinations",
    "@xmath19 the field @xmath20 decouples , while the dynamics of the @xmath21 field is determined by the lagrangian @xmath22 the coupling constant @xmath23 describes the strenght of the tunneling process .",
    "the normalization is such that one has the propagator ( @xmath24 the time ordering operator ) @xmath25 it is then convenient to fold this problem onto the half line @xmath26 $ ] , with action ( here @xmath27 is a non chiral boson ) @xmath28+v      \\cos[\\sqrt{\\nu/ 2}\\phi(0)].\\ ] ] the boundary interaction has physical dimension @xmath29 . in the following we consider mostly the case @xmath30 .",
    "the two amplitudes we wish to consider are what we call the _ reflection _ and _ transmission _ amplitudes for laughlin quasiparticles .",
    "the creation operator of a laughlin quasiparticle in the first luttinger liquid is proportional to @xmath31 so the reflection amplitude ( corresponding to a laughlin quasiparticle going through within the same chiral luttinger liquid ) is @xmath32 while the transmission amplitude ( corresponding to a laughlin quasiparticle jumping from one chiral luttinger liquid to the other ) reads @xmath33 the main technical difference between these two amplitudes is the fact that exponentials of the field @xmath21 have opposite signs in the reflection case and identical signs in the transmission case . restricting to @xmath30 , the two objects we have to determine are thus @xmath34 to proceed , we first use the mapping to the folded theory on the half line .",
    "a field at @xmath35 is an ` in ' , right moving field , while a field at @xmath36 now becomes an ` out ' , left moving field .",
    "the new correlators are then given by @xmath37 the general approach to compute such correlators is the massless form - factors technique @xcite . let us therefore recall some basic facts about integrable boundary field theories .",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized using a quasiparticle basis , with left and right massless particles @xmath38 , carrying a label @xmath39 corresponding to soliton or antisoliton . the bulk scattering of these quasiparticles is @xmath40 .",
    "their boundary scattering is @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the form - factors of the vertex operators can in principle be obtained by taking the massless limit of the formulas in @xcite .",
    "subtleties arise in taking this limit however .",
    "let us first recall the massive result . restricting to @xmath43 , the basic formula in @xcite reads , setting @xmath44 , @xmath45 the vacuum expectation value itself is obtained using techniques of @xcite and is of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a uv cut - off and @xmath48 a numerical constant",
    "whose expression is exactly known .",
    "notice that the form factors are neutral , that is they are non zero only acting on states whose total solitonic charge vanishes exactly .",
    "the massless limit is obtained by letting rapidities go to infinity setting @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and letting at the same time the mass go to zero with @xmath51 ( the choice of this constant is non universal , and can be absorbed in a global shift of the rapidities ) .",
    "for example , let us take the massless limit of the form - factor by choosing @xmath52 of the @xmath53 particles with charge @xmath54 to be r movers , and @xmath55 to be @xmath56 movers ( with @xmath57 ) and similarly , @xmath58 particles among the @xmath53 particles with charge @xmath59 to be r movers , @xmath23 particles to be l movers ( with @xmath60 ) . as @xmath50",
    ", the leading behaviour of the ratio ( [ formfactori ] ) behaves as @xmath61 { e^{\\theta_{0}pq}e^{\\theta_{0}uv}\\over e^{\\theta_{0}pv}e^{\\theta_{0}uq}}\\ ] ] this can be rewritten as @xmath62}$ ] . taking the prefactor @xmath63 into account",
    ", it thus follows that the form - factors all vanish in the massless limit .",
    "the calculation of correlators is thus bound to be a complex task : what happens is that , while the form - factors vanish in that limit , the integrals over rapidities all diverge at low energy due to the presence of infinitely many soft modes , an `` ir catastrophe '' , making the contributions to correlators of undertermined form @xmath64 . the proper way to proceed would be to keep track of this divergence carefully , by making calculations at finite mass , and then considering the limit when the length scales get much smaller than the inverse of this mass .",
    "it is not clear however how many form - factors would have to be taken into account in order to get accurate results - probably an infinity - and this procedure clearly is not efficient .",
    "the procedure we will use below bypasses this difficulty , and consists in working directly within the massless theory , essentially by considering ratios of correlators , which gets rid of the overall normalization problem .",
    "it turns out that the ratios ( [ formfactori ] ) have different behaviours depending on @xmath65 and the balance of charges .",
    "in particular , the limit of the ratio is always finite when the charges are individually balanced in the left and right sector . in that case , the ratio factorizes , and one can individually define l and r versions as ( setting @xmath66 ) @xmath67 for @xmath68 , this is in fact the only case where the ratio has a non zero limit .",
    "our procedure thus seems well defined when @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath70 , some of the ratios ( [ formfactori ] ) diverge in the massless limit , and handling out the form - factors series is thus probably even more difficult .",
    "we have not tackled this case , but see the appendix for analytical techniques .",
    "the case @xmath71 is special .",
    "in addition to the case where",
    "l and r sectors are separately neutral , the ratio ( [ formfactori ] ) also has a finite limit when the balance of charges is @xmath72 in the r sector and @xmath15 in the l sector .",
    "for instance @xmath73 while the same expression for @xmath74 vanishes in the massless limit .",
    "finally , the case @xmath75 is also special , even in the massive case .",
    "this is because @xmath76 vanishes , while the constant @xmath48 diverges .",
    "the best way to understand what happens is to make connection with fields with @xmath77 and fermion operators in a free fermion theory . in the massless limit",
    ", one finds that @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is discussed in more details below .",
    "the normalization of multiparticle states in ( [ formfactor ] ) is @xmath79 .",
    "we denote below the creation operators @xmath80 such that eg @xmath81 . left and right creation / annihilation operators anticommute .",
    "the boundary interaction can be conveniently handled by moving to an euclidian description , such that the impurity interaction becomes a boundary interaction , the boundary lying along the imaginary time axis .",
    "one then makes a a wick rotation , and quantizes the theory along the boundary axis instead .",
    "the coordinate along the boundary , @xmath82 , is related with the time by @xmath83 .",
    "the whole effect of the boundary interaction is then taken into account by the boundary state @xcite , whose expression in the integrable basis is extremely simple : @xmath84\\ ] ] here , the @xmath85 matrix is simply related with the @xmath86 matrix and given by @xmath87      a calculation involving up to two particles gives then the following expression , where we neglected some trivial normalization factors ( note that the l particles are only annihilated by the @xmath56 field and the @xmath86 ones by the @xmath86 field ) @xmath88 { 2\\over 1+e^{\\hat{\\beta}}}\\right .",

    "this integral is divergent at low energies @xmath90 due to the proliferation of low energy particles , and the expression as it stands can not be used .",
    "integrals converge at high energy since @xmath91 .",
    "to proceed , we use a technique @xcite experimented in this context in @xcite . denote @xmath92 and observe that the low energy limit is also the limit @xmath93 , where the field @xmath21 sees dirichlet boundary conditions , and",
    "thus we do know that the correlator should go as @xmath94 corresponding to a totally diagonal scattering .",
    "the trick to obtain finite results will thus be to consider not @xmath95 itself but the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "writing to first non trivial order @xmath97 , we thus consider the new approximation to the correlator @xmath98 and expand the ratio to first order ( ie , two @xmath99 integrals ) @xmath100\\ ] ] this procedure happens to give finite integrals , as is easily seen at this order , since the subtraction of @xmath101 cancels the divergence of the first integral in ( [ formal ] ) .",
    "it follows that , to leading order , the full correlator of interest reads , after the wick rotation @xmath102 after a few simple manipulations using the laplace representation of the square root prefactor , we end up with @xmath103\\ ] ] in the low energy ( that is , low energy of incident particles ) limit @xmath104 , corresponding to total transmission , @xmath105 , as expected . in the high energy limit @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "this latter result clearly does not make much sense , as one expects @xmath108 to vanish in this limit .",
    "a higher order calculation is perfectly possible , and would extend the degree of validity of the form - factors result towards high energies , while giving an essentially exact result at low energies . for any finite order",
    "however , the form - factors result seem to always become unreliable at sufficiently high energy , and behave like the first order in that limit . rather than pursuing this direction ( which might be the only one avaialble for other values of @xmath8 ) , it is better to observe that the quantity @xmath109 can be evaluated in closed form .",
    "this follows from a chain or arguments relating it to a very elegant calculation of the one point function of the spin operator in the ising model with a boundary magnetic field carried out by chatterjee and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "the same kind of argument was used in the study of the friedel oscillations in @xcite . there",

    "this is similar but different from the usual result in the bulk @xcite @xmath114 this result immediately extends to the case where the right and the left field are inserted at different points , since the correlator depends on @xmath115 only : @xmath116 using form factors , one can expand the one point function of the ising spin operator as @xmath117 and one can also check the factorization ( [ factorisation ] ) of @xmath8 directly using the form - factors expansion as described in @xcite.the case of infinite magnetic field corresponds to @xmath118 and since @xmath119 it also corresponds to @xmath120 in this formula . in that case the result is known to be @xmath121 from boundary conformal field theory . recall on the other hand the result that @xmath122 one thus find that @xmath123 where the factor @xmath6 came up in the argument of the bessel function since in the initial ising case , our variable @xmath113 would be twice the value in ( [ nicezam ] ) .",
    "we can now use the integral representation @xmath124 to write @xmath125 giving rise to the stunningly simple momentum dependent transmission amplitude @xmath126 finally , we perform a shift ( in the rapidity variable ) of the integration contour to get back to the theory in real time , quantized with @xmath113 as the space axis , and the interaction at the origin , which amounts to @xmath127 : @xmath128 note that this result could also be obtained by quantizing the theory in the crossed channel . in that case",
    ", the boundary interaction appears because asymptotic states are of the form @xmath129 , and leads to expressions with the shifted contour , and @xmath85 replaced by @xmath86 .",
    "this correspondence is discussed in details in @xcite .    at low energy , @xmath130 and at high energies",
    "@xmath131 : this is the expected behaviour .",
    "indeed , in the limit of small @xmath132 the perturbative expansion should be linear in @xmath133 , and one thus expects the expansion to go as @xmath134 . on the other hand , at large @xmath132 , one approaches the ir fixed point ( total transmission ) , along the operators @xmath135 of dimension @xmath136 , and @xmath137 @xcite(here , @xmath138 is the dual of the field @xmath21 , and the theory is defined on the half line ) .",
    "the coupling of these operators must therefore have dimension @xmath15 , and thus be proportional to @xmath139 since @xmath23 has dimension @xmath6 .",
    "the perturbative series starts linearly in the coupling , that is linear in @xmath140 , as we just found .",
    "it is interesting to recall that the bessel function @xmath141 only admits an _",
    "asymptotic expansion _ in powers of the argument @xmath142 .\\",
    "] ] in our problem , this corresponds to the expansion near the ir fixed point ( low energy of incident particles , large @xmath132 ) , which is thus only asymptotic for the correlator ( in fact , the expansion of @xmath141 is good only up to exponential terms @xmath143 . here",
    "this corresponds to terms @xmath144 , which are non perturbative in term of the ir coupling constant @xmath145 ) .",
    "all these difficulties disappear however in the momentum dependent amplitude , whose expansion is now convergent , thanks to the laplace transform .",
    "let us get back finally to the expression for @xmath146 .",
    "the leading order in @xmath147 is proportional to @xmath148 . in perturbation",
    "theory meanwhile , the leading order involves an integral over the boundary ( in the euclidian formalism ) @xmath149 which must be regularized by the introduction of an ir cut - off .",
    "the situation is similar to the massive bulk ising model or the bulk sine - gordon model at @xmath150 ( see @xcite and referecnes therein ) .",
    "an additional renormalization is required , leading to the replacement of the cut - off by the inverse of the mass - here , by the inverse coupling constant @xmath151 .",
    "alternatively , one could instead consider the correlator at finite temperature .",
    "@xmath152 then acts as an ir cut - off , and the scaling limit of @xmath153 is entirely well defined .",
    "taking the limit @xmath154 then gives the result mentioned above @xcite .",
    "the reflection amplitude is an intriguing quantity .",
    "let us think of it first by considering the vicinity of the ir fixed point , which is is approached along the operator @xmath155 . in an ir perturbation theory , the average of the quantity @xmath156 $ ] will vanish to every order , because a charge neutral exponential can never be formed .",
    "therefore , if the reflection amplitude happpened to be non zero , if would be entirely due to non perturbative effects ! in fact , we think this amplitude is exactly zero .",
    "this can be argued more solidly by considering the uv point of view .",
    "the form of the ir perturbation shows that , right at the uv fixed point , the field at the boundary obeys @xmath157 , @xmath53 an integer .",
    "it follows that the quantity @xmath156 $ ] changes sign when one goes from one well of the boundary potential to the next . since a proper conformal invariant boundary condition involves a sum over all wells , the average @xmath158\\rangle$ ] has to vanish right at the fixed point .",
    "this observation can be made more formal by appealing to the formalism of conformal boundary conditions ( notations follow those of @xcite ; @xmath159 are the usual bosonic modes ; @xmath160 the zero modes ) .",

    "the corresponding state is not in the decomposition of the @xmath164 boundary state , and therefore the one point function has to vanish .    in a uv perturbation theory ,",
    "the same sum over wells ( which is compatible with the perturbation ) will give rise to the same result .",

    "the operator @xmath165 $ ] is not neutral , and increases the @xmath170 charge by one unit .",
    "the non zero form - factors therefore will have to involve an _",
    "odd _ number of particles .",
    "since the boundary state is a superposition of an even number of particles only , the one point function of this operator must vanish identically .",
    "a close correspondence with the disorder operator in the ising model is discussed in the appendix .",
    "of course , right at the uv fixed point , one can `` by hand '' restrict to one well of the potential , and find a non zero amplitude , of the expected form @xmath171 .",
    "it is tempting to force this amplitude to be non zero away from the fixed point as well .",
    "to do so , one can again use the form - factors approach .",
    "as explained in the appendix , the non zero value right at the uv fixed point can be obtained by adding to the boundary state a particle of vanishing energy ( and momentum ) .",
    "it is reasonable to try to define a non zero amplitude near the uv fixed point by generalizing the addition of this particle at finite value of the coupling .",
    "this leads to the result @xmath172\\rangle_{\\tilde{h}}\\ ] ] where the second quantity has the form factor expansion @xmath173 and the minus signs have been generated by the introduction of the particle at zero energy .",
    "of course , this expansion is once again divergent .",
    "moreover , in contrast with the case of the transmission amplitude , we do not even know the value in the ir , so we can not divide by it to form a finite quantity .",
    "we can however observe that the logarithmic derivative of the correlator is regularizable by the same procedure previously used for @xmath111 .",
    "the first two terms read for instance @xmath174 ( where recall @xmath175 ) .",
    "the integrals converge now at the origin , including when @xmath176 .",
    "call the series in the right hand side @xmath177 .",
    "we can thus try to write @xmath178\\ ] ] although right at @xmath176 this expression reproduces the right result , there is a problem as soon as @xmath179 .",
    "this is because , at every order we have explored , @xmath180 goes to a finite quantity as @xmath181 , and thus the integral diverges at the origin !",
    "this can be studied in more details at the first order already , where the exponential reads , for small @xmath132 , @xmath182\\ ] ] to make the integral finite we have to introduce a new ( ir ) cut - off @xmath183 , with dimension of temperature @xmath184 , so we get @xmath185 if we now let the cut - off go to zero , we see that the amplitude again vanishes .",
    "a similar result was noticed independently by n. sandler ( private communication ) .",
    "this result is confirmed by higher order calculations .",
    "we think it is a consequence of the ill defined nature of the reflection amplitude within field theory , and can be interpreted by saying that this reflection amplitude is identically zero for any @xmath179 , in the scaling limit .",
    "the only way to define this amplitude is to keep an additional ( ir ) cut - off , and then , to first order in the form - factors expansion , one finds @xmath186\\ ] ] it is in fact possible to obtain the exact value of the one point function by using more results about the ising model , as detailed in the appendix : @xmath187 where again @xmath188 . from this",
    "the result follows that @xmath189 at large values of @xmath190 .    to each order",
    "we have explored , the value of the exponent at the origin was @xmath191 , that is , every contribution but the first one seemed to vanish exactly .",
    "meanwhile , the exact value expected from the formula ( [ brave ] ) is @xmath6 .",
    "most likely what happens is that the form - factors expansion does not converge uniformly at the origin - an identical feature takes place in the case of the ordinary one point function @xmath111 .",
    "going back now to the physical amplitude we find @xmath192 in particular it follows that @xmath193 in the ir limit .",
    "what one may call an `` andreev process '' meanwhile would correspond to a laughlin quasiparticle incident on the point contact giving rise to an electron in the same chiral luttinger liquid , and a laughlin quasihole in the other chiral luttinger liquid .",
    "the amplitude for this process is @xmath194 the interacting part of this correlator , after using even odd combinations and folding , becomes @xmath195 and the argument has the form @xmath196 .",
    "this time , the exponential is invariant when going from one well to the next , so the average will be non trivial .",
    "the amplitude vanishes both in the uv and ir limits , but has non vanishing perturbative contributions in the vicinity of either fixed point .",
    "all indications are that this amplitude is well defined in the scaling limit .",
    "in fact , the momentum dependent amplitude @xmath197 ( with say @xmath55 the amplitude of the outgoing electron ) has the same dimension as the would be amplitude for the reflection process ( [ compconj ] ) .",
    "it is likely that the regularized reflection amplitude we have defined previously ( [ compconj ] ) coincides with the limit of @xmath197 as @xmath55 goes to zero ( and then @xmath55 has to be identified with @xmath183 ) .",
    "note finally that by folding one can map the geometry of two r moving luttinger liquids to the geometry of a single non chiral luttinger liquid .",
    "this can actually be done in several ways : the most natural is illustrated on the figure [ fig2 ] . in this case , what we called before transmission amplitude becomes a backscattering amplitude ( small at small @xmath23 ) and what we called reflection amplitude becomes transmission amplitude ( small at large @xmath23 ) .",
    "a fundamental component in the experimental study of luttinger liquids is the presence of a point contact with a three dimensional reservoir ( in fact , a semi infinite three dimensional reservoir , whose boundary is a plane @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the situation is somewhat similar to the kondo problem .",
    "electrons in the 3d reservoir can be organized not into plane waves but into spherical waves , and one finds that only the @xmath198 wave interacts with the luttinger liquid ( the kondo impurity in the other case ) . because there is a single mode ,",

    ", one can map this problem onto the one of two chiral ( say right moving ) liquids with an interaction localized at the origin , corresponding to the bottom part of [ fig3 ] . the translation between the two is obvious ( and different from the folding in figure [ fig2 ] ) : for instance , a process where an electron comes in and bounces within the fermi liquid corresponds in the unfolded picture to an electron going through on the top line .    in a particular experiment ,",
    "different tunneling terms will be induced by the realization of the point contact . at low energy - or low temperature -",
    "the decoupled fixed point , where the two electronic liquids are decoupled , is stable . to leading order ,",
    "the tunneling that kicks in as energy is increased is a process where one electron from the fermi liquid is exchanged for an `` edge '' electron in the luttinger liquid .",

    "the lagrangian reads @xmath200,\\ ] ] where the field @xmath201 is associated with the luttinger liquid , and @xmath202 with the fermi liquid .",

    "the fields can now be gathered into an even combination which is free , and an odd combination that sees a boundary sine - gordon type interaction .",
    "the perturbation induced by the tunneling term has dimension @xmath207 , and is _ irrelevant_.",
    "this means that at low energies , there is essentially no tunneling between the initial fermi and luttinger liquids : one is at the fixed point where transmission is zero .",
    "this crucial feature of the problem , induces considerable complications . indeed , suppose one were to consider an experimental realization starting from the trivial situation of decoupled wires at low energy , and increasing the energy to explore the non trivial scattering processed . in term of renormalization group , this would translate into going _ against the rg flow _",
    ", since the low energy fixed point is stable , and the coupling between the wires is an irrelevant perturbation .",
    "as is well known , such a situation does not have a well defined universal limit , as the rg trajectory is influenced by the many other irrelevant operators present in the problem . in our case , this means for instance that one also has to take into account the density density coupling , which also has dimension @xmath207 , as well as other fields maybe , and the results will be affected by the balance of these different terms .",
    "a priori , only extreme fine tuning would allow one to reach the perfect transmitting fixed point at high energy .    fortunately , there seems to be a way to realize the high energy fixed point @xmath208 .",
    "indeed , in a very interesting paper , c. kane @xcite pointed out that if tunneling between the two liquids takes place through an impurity , it is possible , by tuning two parameters only , to achieve perfect resonance that is , to have perfect tunneling between the fermi and luttinger liquids .",
    "away from the resonance , deviations are controlled by the single relevant operator at the resonant fixed point , and the problem becomes formally identical to the by now well known problem of edge states tunneling at @xmath209 .    in this new situation , at high energy , there is maximum tunneling between the fermi and the luttinger liquid which are strongly coupled , while at low energy , there is no remaining tunneling , the two are decoupled , and the scattering is entirely diagonal .",
    "this is illustrated on the figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the problem in the vicinity of the perfectly transmitting fixed point can be formulated in terms of dual fields , with lagrangian @xmath210 and @xmath211 . in this case , the perturbation is relevant , with dimension @xmath6 .",

    "we first would like to discuss this result further . to do so",

    "this calculation is formally the same as the calculation of the one point function of the spin @xmath328 for an ising model where the boundary perturbation , instead of being the boundary field , would induce the following equations of motion : ( if @xmath329 is the coordinate along the boundary as in @xcite ) @xmath330 note the crucial minus sign on the right hand side - in the usual problem of ising model with a boundary magnetic field , the rhs comes with a plus sign , and the physics is the flow from free to fixed boundary conditions .",

    ", one has to be a bit careful . from entropy considerations",

    "since on the other hand the correlation functions of the spin operator with these ( conserved ) quantities all vanish with free boundary conditions , it follows that , in a perturbative expansion near the free boundary conditions ( ir ) fixed point , @xmath328 has to vanish identically . of course",

    "<S> by a mix of form - factors and analyticity techniques , we determine some fundamental scattering amplitudes in non - fermi liquid systems . </S>",
    "<S> these include the reflection and transmission amplitudes for laughlin quasiparticles at a point contact between two @xmath0 luttinger liquids , and the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at a point contact between a fermi liquid and a @xmath4 luttinger liquid ( all liquids chiral or not ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results are obtained in closed form , and give rise to rather simple expressions for the probabilities of the most basic processes of non fermi liquid physics at these special values of the couplings . </S>"
