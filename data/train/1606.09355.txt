    "as a primary step for steering chemical dynamics , directional bond breaking is one of the most fundamental and interesting phenomena in molecular dissociative ionization .",
    "it can be coherently controlled by using carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) stabilized few - cycle @xcite or two - color @xcite ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "previous studies have demonstrated that the directional bond breaking in dissociative ionization of a diatomic molecule with symmetric orbital profile along the molecular axis is governed by the pathway interference of the dissociating nuclear wave packets @xcite .",
    "the most intensively investigated example is the dissociative single ionization of molecular hydrogen and its isotopes @xcite , which have symmetric electron distribution along the molecular axis .    for many heteronuclear diatomic molecules , the electron distributions around two nuclei are asymmetric , thus both the ionization and dissociation may be directional and contribute to the ultimate asymmetric ionic fragment emission .",
    "for instance co is preferred to be ionized by the laser field pointing from c to o along the molecular axis @xcite",
    ". the created molecular ion with biased orientation can subsequently be dissociated by the same asymmetric ultrashort laser pulse and may involve laser - induced coupling of electronic states , which in itself might result in an asymmetric ionic fragment emission @xcite .",
    "we note that the controllable directional strong - field dissociative ionization was recently demonstrated in multiply charged states @xcite , polyatomic @xcite and hydrocarbon molecules @xcite , and further in two - dimensional space @xcite .",
    "one essential aspect to thoroughly understand the directional dissociative ionization of complex molecules is to clearly distinguish individual contributions of the ionization and dissociation steps .",
    "it will also allow us to testify for the directional dissociation of a multi - electron system the role of laser - induced coupling of various electronic states , which rules the directional dissociation of the one - electron molecule h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , the coexistence of asymmetric ionization and asymmetric dissociation within a single femtosecond laser pulse blurs the contributions responsible for the ultimate directional emission of ionic fragments .    in this paper , using co as a prototype",
    ", we conceived a strategy to disentangle the contributions from either step .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the single ionization created co@xmath0 cation by an elliptically polarized pump pulse ,",
    "i.e. co + n@xmath2 @xmath3 co@xmath0 + @xmath4 , is dissociated by a time - delayed linearly polarized two - color pulse into c@xmath0 and a neutral o atom , labeled as ( c@xmath0 , o ) .",
    "the distinguished momentum distributions of electrons governed by the light polarizations allow us to identify the ionization and the dissociation induced by the pump and probe pulses . by coincidentally detecting the released electron and c@xmath0",
    ", we can attribute the observed directional ejection of c@xmath0 upon the bond breaking of co@xmath0 to the phase - dependent laser - induced coupling of various electronic states .",
    "the mechanism is numerically verified by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) .",
    "the experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum cold - target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy ( coltrims ) setup @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",

    "was split into pump and probe pulses .",
    "the pump pulse was adjusted to be elliptically polarized in the _ y - z _ plane with the major and minor axes along _ y_- and _ z_-axis , respectively .",
    "the two - color probe pulse was generated in a collinear scheme .",
    "z_-direction polarized fundamental - wave ( fw ) was frequency doubled in a 200 @xmath6m - thick @xmath7-barium borate ( bbo ) crystal to produce a second harmonic ( sh ) through the type - i phase matching .",
    "the polarization of the fw was rotated to be parallel to that of the sh along the _ y_-axis by using a dual - color wave plate .",
    "the time lag between the fw and sh pulses was compensated by a birefringent @xmath8-bbo crystal .",
    "a pair of fused silica wedges were used to continuously vary the relative phase @xmath9 between the fw and sh waves of the two - color pulse .",
    "the pump and probe pulses were collinearly combined using a beam splitter , which were afterwards sent into the vacuum chamber and focused onto the molecular beam using a concave silver mirror with a focusing length of _ _ f__=@xmath10 mm .",
    "the molecular beam was generated by supersonically co - expanding a mixture of 10% co and 90% he through a 30 @xmath6 m nozzle with a driving pressure of 1.5 bar .",
    "the intensities of the pump pulse , the fw and sh fields of the two - color probe pulse on the supersonic molecular beam of co were measured to be 2.3@xmath11 , 6.5@xmath12 , and 8@xmath13 w/@xmath14 , respectively . to avoid the influence of impulsive molecular alignment ( rotational period t@xmath15 = 8.64 ps for co ) by the pump pulse @xcite , the two - color probe pulse was time delayed by 10.7 ps to dissociate a randomly orientated co@xmath0 ensemble created by the pump pulse . in our measurement ,",

    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the slight shift of the electron momentum distribution to the second and fourth quadrants is mainly due to the coulomb potential effect of the ionic core on the departing electron @xcite .",

    "[ fig2](a ) . since only events with one detected electron",
    "are selected , the observed ( c@xmath0 , o ) breakup correlated to electrons in the @xmath19 region stands for both ionization and dissociation by the probe pulse . on the other hand , electrons in the @xmath18 region correspond to the ionization by the pump pulse , while the created co@xmath0 could be dissociated into the ( c@xmath0 , o ) pair either by the pump pulse itself or later on by the time - delayed probe pulse .",
    "we are mostly interested in the latter case , i.e. the ionization by the pump pulse and dissociation by the probe pulse .",
    "this scenario excludes the influence of molecular orientation - dependent field ionization and thus reveals the role of laser - induced coupling of various electronic states of the molecular ion on the directional dissociation .    to extract the real pump - ionization probe - dissociation ( c@xmath0 , o ) breakup events",

    "the similar positions of the ker peaks indicate that ( c@xmath0 , o ) breakup is governed by the two - step process : the pump pulse singly ionizes co , and the produced co@xmath0 is later on dissociated by the probe pulse .",

    "<S> the directional control of molecular dissociation with a laser electric field waveform is a paradigm and was demonstrated for a variety of molecules . in most cases , </S>",
    "<S> the directional control occurs via a dissociative ionization pathway . </S>",
    "<S> the role of laser - induced coupling of electronic states in the dissociating ion versus selective ionization of oriented neutral molecules , however , could not be distinguished for even small heteronuclear molecules such as co. here , we introduce a technique , using elliptically polarized pump and linearly polarized two - color probe pulses , that unambiguously distinguishes the roles of laser - induced state coupling and selective ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the measured photoelectron momentum distributions governed by the light polarizations allow us to coincidentally identify the ionization and dissociation from the pump and probe pulses . </S>",
    "<S> directional dissociation of co@xmath0 as a function of the relative phase of the linearly polarized two - color pulse is observed for both parallel and orthogonally oriented molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the laser - induced coupling of various electronic states of co@xmath0 plays an important role for the observed directional bond breaking , which is verified by quantum calculations . </S>"
