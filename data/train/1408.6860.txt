    "the concept of composite fermions was introduced to understand quantum hall states .",
    "@xcite using this concept , halperin , lee and reed  @xcite ( hlr ) further developed the composite fermi liquid ( cfl ) theory to understand the gapless single layer half - filled landau level problem . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "this theory predicts a compressible  metal \" with a sharp fermi surface , which has received some support from experiments.@xcite however , in such a gapless system , the emergent chern - simons ( cs ) gauge field fluctuations can play an important role .",
    "in fact , these fluctuations can mediate an attractive density - current interaction between the fluxes attached to a composite fermion and the current associated with another composite fermion .",
    "as was shown by greiter , wen and wilczek  @xcite ( gww ) , the mean field fermi surface is always unstable to the formation of cooper pairs in odd angular momentum channels .",
    "thus at low temperatures , the system ends up in a superconducting state with an order parameter that is most likely a chiral @xmath3-wave",
    ".    however , bonesteel@xcite showed that if we go beyond gww analysis and consider the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite corrections , there will be an induced current - current interaction mediated by the transverse cs gauge field .",
    "the current - current interaction is repulsive and divergent in the small matsubara frequency limit for all angular momentum channels . using this small frequency limit for the entire range of matsubara frequencies , and assuming the gap to be weakly dependent on matsubara frequencies , the zero temperature ( @xmath4 ) bcs gap equation was solved analytically .",
    "the conclusion was that with a bare short - range contact interaction , the pair - breaking current - current interaction always dominates over other interactions when the bcs gap is small .",
    "therefore there is no gww pairing instablity .",
    "however the gap equation was found to have have a solution when the gap was finite .",
    "thus the zero temperature pairing transition was conjectured to be first order for short - range interaction , while for a long - range coulomb interaction , a continuous pairing transition was considered to be a possibility because of weaker gauge field fluctuations .",
    "the above analysis , based on the small frequency limit of the current - current interaction needs to be reexamined .",
    "a recent work  @xcite of our group involving non - relativistic fermions coupled to a transverse gauge field suggests that although the current - current interaction is repulsive and singular in the small frequency limit , at higher frequencies it can be attractive for angular momentum channels @xmath5 .",
    "this attractive part can outweigh the repulsive part , thus changing the solution to the bcs equation completely .",
    "therefore it is crucial to consider the full matsubara frequency dependence of the current - current interaction and solve the bcs gap equation in a self - consistent manner .",
    "in addition to the single layer case , we also consider the full frequency dependent analysis of the double layer hall system with a total filling fraction @xmath2 .",
    "this system is decoupled into two separate composite fermion metals with @xmath6 in each layer if there are no disorder or inter - layer tunneling .",
    "if we include the most singular interaction , namely the inter - layer current - current interaction , the interaction can be attractive or repulsive depending on whether it is mediated by the out - of - phase or the in - phase mode of the cs gauge field fluctuations .",
    "@xcite the competition between these two will determine the final fate of the double layer system .",
    "@xcite showed that this interaction always drives the system into a inter - layer paired state for any large separation @xmath7 between the two layers .",
    "however , this conclusion was also obtained from the previously mentioned small frequency analysis .",
    "therefore , for similar reasons , it must be reexamined if only to put it on a firmer basis .",
    "the major results of our paper are as follows : ( 1 ) for the single layer system with either short - range contact interaction or long - range coulomb interaction , there can be a _",
    "transition from the hlr state to a chiral odd @xmath8-wave cooper pair state .",
    "( 2 ) for the double layer system , there is always a non - zero pairing between inter - layer composite fermions if the inter - layer spacing @xmath7 is much greater than the magnetic length @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the small frequency analysis  @xcite does not qualitatively differ from the full frequency dependent analysis , except for significant quantitative differences .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ single - lyr formalism ] we derive the bcs gap equation for the @xmath6 single layer system ; in sec .",
    "[ single - lyr results ] we present our numerical results for the single layer system with short - range contact interaction and also briefly discuss the results for the long - range coulomb interaction ; in sec .",
    "[ bi - layer formalism ] we write down the bcs gap equation for the double layer system and present our numerical results ; in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we summarize our conclusion and provide some further discussions .",
    "consider a two - dimensional ( @xmath10 ) electron gas with a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath11 at a filling fraction @xmath12 .",
    "for half - filling @xmath13 . in the cfl picture ,",
    "@xmath14 , the emergent flux is described by the cs gauge fields @xmath15 attached to an electron to form a composite fermion . to describe this flux attachment ,",
    "we need to add a cs term to the free electron action .",
    "thus , without interactions , the total euclidian lagrangian density is given by  @xcite @xmath16 with ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the composite fermion field , @xmath20 is the composite fermion effective mass , and @xmath21 , the physical magnetic field . at the mean field level , @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath11 being the applied magnetic field .",
    "then the cs gauge field exactly cancels the external magnetic field .",

    "@xcite it turns out that the full frequency dependence of the effective interaction does not change their qualitative conclusion .",
    "this is because the two contributions to the effective interaction coming from the in - phase and out - of - phase mode fluctuations of the cs gauge field cancel each other out at high frequencies .",
