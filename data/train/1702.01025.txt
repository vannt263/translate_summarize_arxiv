    ", the borel - cantelli lemma implies that if @xmath4 then @xmath5 is finite for a.e .",
    "conversely , assuming pairwise independence , we also have that if @xmath7 then @xmath8 is infinite for a.e .",
    "the condition of pairwise independence is too restrictive to hold in most deterministic systems , nevertheless , in many cases one can still obtain a converse statement under some additional regularity conditions on the target sets .",
    "such results , usually referred to as dynamical borel - cantelli lemmas , were established in many dynamical systems with fast mixing .",
    "for example , the exponential rate of mixing for diagonalizable group actions on homogenous spaces was used in @xcite to study various shrinking target problems in this setting , while in @xcite similar results were obtained for other dynamical systems on more general metric spaces having exponential ( or super polynomial ) rate of mixing .",
    "we note that in all these cases , in addition to fast mixing , some additional geometric assumptions on the shrinking sets were needed ( e.g. , they are assumed to be cusp neighborhoods or metric balls shrinking to a point ) .    for systems with a polynomial rate of mixing",
    "the problem is more subtle . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for shrinking metric balls , @xmath10 , that do nt shrink too fast , a sufficiently fast polynomial rate of mixing implies that @xmath5 is infinite for a.e .",
    "@xmath6 . on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "fayad gave examples of a dynamical system with a polynomial rate of mixing , and a sequence of shrinking metric balls , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 ( and even with @xmath13 unbounded ) , for which generic orbits eventually miss the shrinking targets .",
    "there is thus no hope to prove a general dynamical borel cantelli lemma for systems with polynomial mixing rate .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem for the dynamical system given by a discrete time flow on a hyperbolic manifold , @xmath14 , or rather its frame bundle @xmath3 .",
    "this includes the geodesic flow , but also unipotent flows having a polynomial rate of mixing which can be arbitrarily slow .",
    "nevertheless , by using new ideas from @xcite utilizing an effective mean ergodic theorem to study shrinking target problems , together with results from spectral theory of hyperbolic manifolds , we are able to prove a dynamical borel - cantelli lemma for these flows for any family of shrinking targets in @xmath14 .",
    "this seems to be the first result of this kind that applies to any family of shrinking targets with no assumptions on their regularity , and also the first result that applies to dynamical systems with arbitrarily slow polynomial mixing      let @xmath15 denote real hyperbolic @xmath16-space and @xmath17 its group of isometries ( so @xmath18 , and we can identify @xmath19 with @xmath20 a maximal compact group ) . here and below we will always use @xmath16 to denote the real dimension of @xmath15 . for @xmath21 a lattice , let @xmath22 denote the corresponding hyperbolic manifold ( or orbifold ) and let @xmath23 ( that we can identify as the frame bundle of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the homogenous space @xmath3 has a natural @xmath24-invariant probability measure , @xmath25 , coming from the haar measure of @xmath24 , and the projection of this measure to @xmath14 , still denoted by @xmath25 , is the hyperbolic volume measure .",
    "a discrete one parameter group is a subgroup , @xmath26 , satisfying that @xmath27 for any @xmath28 .",
    "given an unbounded discrete one parameter group , its right action on @xmath23 generates a measure preserving discrete time homogenous flow , which is ergodic by moore s ergodicity theorem .",
    "a sequence of sets , @xmath29 , is called a family of shrinking targets if @xmath30 for all @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we say that a set @xmath33 is spherical if it is invariant under the right action of @xmath34 , and note that any set , @xmath35 in the base manifold , can be lifted to a spherical set @xmath33 .",
    "we will thus identify any family of shrinking targets in @xmath14 with a corresponding family of spherical shrinking targets in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath17 , @xmath21 a lattice , and let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be as above .",
    "consider the dynamical system given by a discrete time homogenous flow , @xmath36 acting on @xmath3 . given a sequence @xmath29 of shrinking targets",
    "we say that the orbit of a point @xmath6 is hitting the targets if the set @xmath37 is unbounded and denote the set of points with hitting orbits by @xmath38 .",
    "the following result gives precise conditions on when @xmath38 is a null set and when it is of full measure .",
    "[ t : bct ] assume that @xmath39 . for any family , @xmath40 , of spherical shrinking targets we have that @xmath38 is of full measure ( respectively a null set ) if and only if the series @xmath41 diverges ( respectively converges ) .",
    "moreover , if the sequence @xmath42 is unbounded , then there is a subsequence @xmath43 such that for a.e . @xmath6",
    "@xmath44    we note that any unbounded one parameter subgroup in @xmath24 is either diagonalizable or unipotent .",
    "if the group @xmath36 is diagonalizable the same results holds also for @xmath45 . for unipotent flows , when @xmath45 , the limit still holds under the stronger assumption that there is some @xmath46 so that @xmath47 is unbounded ; or if @xmath48 is pre - compact and the sequence @xmath49 is unbounded .",
    "it is remarkable that this result holds for any family of spherical shrinking targets with no additional assumption on their geometry or regularity , and applies both for diagonalizable and unipotent flows .",
    "moreover , this result is new even for the classical setting when the targets are shrinking metric balls and the flow is the discrete time geodesic flow , where the best previously known result was @xcite , obtained the same conclusion only under an additional assumption on the rate of decay .    given a sequence @xmath40 of shrinking targets it is not hard to see that @xmath50 implies that there is a subsequence @xmath43 such that @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "when the sequence @xmath42 is unbounded , shows that there is a subsequence so that these intersections are not only non - empty , but in fact contain asymptotically the expected number of elements .",
    "when @xmath42 is bounded , the asymptotics can not be expected to hold ( e.g. if @xmath13 is bounded away from the integers ) . nevertheless , in this case we still have that for a.e . @xmath6",
    "@xmath53      next we study the subtler point of whether the finite orbits @xmath54 hit or miss the targets @xmath10 .",
    "we say that an orbit of a point @xmath6 is _ eventually always hitting _ if @xmath55 for all sufficiently large @xmath31 , and denote by @xmath56 the set of points with such orbits .- dirichlet numbers introduced in @xcite in the context of diophantine approximations .",
    "] this gives rise to the following natural question : under what conditions on the shrinking rate of @xmath57 , can one deduce that @xmath56 has full ( or zero ) measure ?    a soft general argument ( see proposition [ p : converse ] below ) shows that if there is @xmath58 such that the set @xmath59 is unbounded then @xmath56 is a null set .",
    "it is not hard to construct a sequence of sets with @xmath13 unbounded , having a subsequence with , say , @xmath60 .",
    "hence in order to conclude that a generic orbit is eventually always hitting we need a stronger assumption on the rate of shrinking .",
    "our next result shows that the summability condition @xmath61 is sufficient to show that @xmath56 has full measure .",
    "moreover , if we further assume that @xmath62 we can even show that , generically , the intersections have roughly the expected number of elements .    here and",
    "below we use the notation @xmath63 or @xmath64 to indicate that there is a constant @xmath65 such that @xmath66 .",
    "we use subscripts to indicate that constant depends on additional parameters .",
    "we also write @xmath67 to indicate that @xmath68 . with these notations",
    "we have    [ t : asymp ] retain the notation of theorem [ t : bct ] .",
    "then , implies that @xmath56 is of full measure and and imply that for a.e .",
    "@xmath6 for all sufficiently large @xmath31 @xmath69    when @xmath36 is diagnolizable the same result holds also for @xmath45 . for unipotent flows ,",
    "when @xmath45 , the same conclusion holds if we replace the assumption by the stronger assumption that @xmath70 for some @xmath46 , or by the assumption that @xmath48 is pre - compact and @xmath71    in general , we do nt know if there is a clean zero / one law for the measure of @xmath56 as we have for @xmath72 .",
    "however , if the shrinking sets decay polynomially , in the sense that @xmath73 for some @xmath46 , then automatically holds and holds when @xmath74 .",
    "we thus get the following clean result :    [ c : regular ] for @xmath17 with @xmath75 , let @xmath76 denote an unbounded discrete one parameter group and @xmath2 a family of spherical shrinking targets in @xmath23 with @xmath73 . if @xmath77 ( respectively @xmath78 ) then for a.e .",

    "@xmath6 , for all @xmath31 sufficiently large @xmath81      when the group @xmath36 is diagonalizable , taking additional advantage of the exponential rate of mixing , we can adapt our method to get similar results also for non - spherical shrinking targets that are not too irregular .",
    "to make the notion of regular more precise , given parameters @xmath82 and a sobolev norm @xmath83 on @xmath23 ( see section [ s : norms ] blow ) we say that a set @xmath84 is @xmath85-regular for @xmath83 , if there are smooth functions @xmath86 approximating the indicator function , @xmath87 , in the sense that @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "it is always possible to approximate indicator functions by smooth functions in this way .",
    "the additional restriction on the size of the sobolev norm is rather mild as we allow it to grow as any power of @xmath94 . in particular , it is not hard to see that , for any riemannian metric on @xmath24 , the collection of all metric balls and their complements is a regular collection .

    "@xmath6 for all sufficiently large @xmath31 @xmath69      our results on shrinking targets have an immediate application for establishing logarithm laws for penetration depth and first hitting times .",
    "we first recall some of the known results for these problems .",

    "there are no similar known results on logarithm laws for unipotent flows penetrating shrinking balls .",
    "the results mentioned above establishing logarithm laws for cusp excursions actually consider @xmath110 rather than @xmath111 .",
    "however , it is not hard to see that these two quantities are always the same .",
    "for the shrinking balls the two corresponding limits , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , are also the same as long as @xmath114 is not in the orbit of @xmath9 .    for the cusp neighborhoods , since @xmath115 for all @xmath116 , it is possible to replace the discrete iteration by a continuous one to get that @xmath117 . for the shrinking balls ,",
