    "let @xmath6 denote a statistical estimator of an unknown quantity @xmath7 , and assume that @xmath8 is asymptotically normally distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a measure of the sample size from which @xmath6 was computed .",
    "in particular , the statistic @xmath11 is asymptotically normal @xmath12 . under additional assumptions an edgeworth expansion of the distribution of @xmath13",
    "can generally be formulated , having the form @xmath14 uniformly in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the standard normal distribution and density functions , respectively , and @xmath18 is an even , quadratic polynomial .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 denotes the mean of a sample of size @xmath10 from a population with mean  @xmath7 , and if data from the population have finite third moment and a nonlattice distribution , then ( [ eq1.1 ] ) holds with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the standardised skewness of the population . on the other hand , still in the case of the mean of a population with finite third moment ,",
    "if the population is lattice then an extra , discontinuous term has to be added to ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "this extra term reflects the discrete continuity correction that statisticians are often obliged to introduce when approximating a lattice distribution , for example the binomial distribution or the distribution of a sum of poisson variates , using the smooth normal distribution : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the discontinuous term in the edgeworth expansion , @xmath23 is the maximal span of the lattice , @xmath24 is the population variance , @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the largest integer not strictly exceeding @xmath15 , and it is assumed that all points of support in the distribution ( of which @xmath7 is the mean ) have the form @xmath28 for an integer @xmath29 .      we show that in multi - sample problems , where @xmath6 is a sum of several independent means , the discontinuous term can be ignored if sample sizes are chosen judiciously . for example , if there are just two sample sizes ( as in the case of a sum or difference of two binomial proportions ) , and if the lattice edge widths are identical ( this simplifies our discussion here , but is not essential ) , then it is sufficient that the ratio of the two sample sizes converge to an irrational number , or converge sufficiently slowly to a rational number .",
    "these results are corollaries of theorem  [ the1 ] in section  [ sec2.1 ] , and they and other properties are discussed in section  [ sec2.2 ] .    we also show that the discontinuous term can be replaced by @xmath30 , for all @xmath31 , provided that four moments are finite and the ratio of the two sample sizes converges sufficiently quickly to an irrational number of `` type '' 1 .",
    "( see section  [ sec2.3 ] for a definition of the type of an irrational number . )",
    "more generally , we explore the effect that type has on the size of the discontinuous term .",
    "theorem  [ the2 ] also gives an explicit formula for the discontinuous term , up to a remainder of order @xmath32 .",
    "sections  [ sec2.5 ] and  [ sec2.6 ] show how to bound the discontinuous remainder term , for two different approaches to defining that quantity , and show how the effects of irrationals of different types can be teased from the remainder .",
    "applications to the bootstrap are straightforward , and in fact section  [ sec2.7 ] outlines a bootstrap version of theorem  [ the2 ] and discusses its implications .",
    "we do not treat in any detail cases where the differences between two lattice distributions arise mainly in terms of their centres , rather than their lattice edge widths .",
    "for example , if two independent sample means @xmath33 , for @xmath34 , are respectively averages of @xmath35 independent variables and are distributed on lattices @xmath36 ; and if the difference @xmath37 between the lattice translations equals an irrational multiple of the ratio @xmath38 ; then the distribution of @xmath39 is non - lattice . while this problem and its implications are of mathematical interest , they do not enjoy the practical motivation of problems where , say , @xmath40 and @xmath5 can be almost arbitrary .",
    "for example , @xmath40 in the problem of constructing confidence intervals for the sum or difference of two binomial probabilities , based on samples of unequal size .",
    "therefore , we address cases where the focus of attention is @xmath5 rather than @xmath37 .",
    "differences between lattice centres are permitted by our regularity conditions , but their role is not treated in detail .",
    "the extra term in ( [ eq1.2 ] ) , relative to ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , is of significant interest to a practitioner , since it causes significant inaccuracy when the central limit theorem is used to approximate the distribution of @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of this extra term motivates the continuity correction , and also the fiducial approach taken by clopper and pearson @xcite and sterne @xcite to estimating a binomial proportion , as well as a large , more recent literature discussing methodology for solving problems such as constructing confidence intervals for the difference or sum of two binomial proportions .",
    "see , for example , hall @xcite , duffy and santer @xcite , lee et  al .",
    "@xcite , agresti and caffo @xcite , brown et al .",
    "@xcite , zhou et al .",
    "@xcite , price and bonnett @xcite , brown and li @xcite , borkowf @xcite , roths and tebbs @xcite , wang @xcite and zieliski @xcite .",
    "the practical motivation for the work described in this paper came from data acquired during quarantine searches , where the construction of confidence intervals for the sum , rather than difference , of two binomial proportions was of interest . in detail , shipping containers arriving at a frontier contained a certain number , @xmath41 say , of consignments .",
    "some of the consignments might be clean , but others could contain pests which needed to be detected and removed to prevent their introduction to the environment . to reduce the costs associated with inspection ,",
    "quarantine services usually inspect only @xmath42 consignments .",
    "consignments are assumed to be contaminated with probability @xmath43 , and the number , @xmath44 say , of contaminated consignments found after routine ( but incomplete ) inspection of the items in each of @xmath3 consignments is assumed to follow a binomial distribution .",
    "contaminated consignments are then `` cleaned , '' and the members of a subsample of @xmath4 of them are reinspected .",
    "( the data gathered in this way comprise a `` leakage survey . '' ) the number of items , @xmath45 , still found contaminated ( for example , contaminated with a different kind of pest ) are assumed to follow a binomial distribution with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath46 , and typically it is argued that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are independent .",
    "an estimator of the proportion of items that pass through this inspection process , and are still contaminated , is given by @xmath49 which can be viewed as a sum of means of lattice - valued random variables where the lattice edge lengths are @xmath50 for @xmath34 .",
    "the quarantine inspection service aims to develop a strategy for choosing consignments , and items , to inspect .",
    "this reduces the associated costs , and minimises , to at least some extent , the number of contaminated items that cross the border .",
    "the performance of such a strategy is assessed , by the quarantine service , using a variety of statistics based on sums of binomials ; ( [ eq1.3 ] ) is just one example .",
    "quarantine services are usually interested in providing confidence intervals as well as point estimators , and hence there is significant interest in estimating the distributions of statistics such as that at  ( [ eq1.3 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath52 , for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , denote independent random variables .",
    "assume that each @xmath52 has a nondegenerate lattice distribution , depending on @xmath55 but not on @xmath56 and with maximal lattice edge width @xmath57 and finite third moment .",
    "suppose too that @xmath58 .",
    "put @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 the model ( [ eq2.1 ] ) includes cases of apparently greater generality , for example where signed weights are incorporated in the series , since the absolute values of the weights can be incorporated into ( [ eq2.1 ] ) by modifying the lattice edge widths , and negative signs can be addressed by reflecting the summand distributions .    since",
    "third moments are finite then , if the distributions of @xmath63 were to satisfy a smoothness condition , such as that of cramr , we could express the distribution of @xmath64 in a one - term edgeworth expansion : @xmath65 where we take @xmath66 to be the asymptotic parameter , and @xmath67 is a measure of standardised skewness and , under our assumptions , is bounded as @xmath68 .",
    "result ( [ eq2.2 ] ) is a version of ( [ eq1.1 ] ) in a particular case .    however , in general ( [ eq2.2 ] ) does not hold in the lattice - valued case that we are considering .",
    "for example , if @xmath69 and the @xmath52s , for all @xmath56 and @xmath55 , have a common lattice distribution , then , as was made clear by esseen @xcite , any expansion of the distribution of @xmath70 has to include a discontinuous term of size @xmath71 ( specifically , the term @xmath72 in  ( [ eq1.2 ] ) ) that reflects the `` continuity correction '' needed to approximate the discontinuous distribution of @xmath73 by a continuous normal distribution .",
    "when exploring this problem , we suppose that the sequence of values of @xmath10 is strictly increasing .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath74 in theorem  [ the1 ] , below , we fix both @xmath75 and the distributions of @xmath76 , for @xmath77 .",
    "this means that @xmath78 are fixed too .",
    "however , for each @xmath10 we consider there to be a potentially new sequence of values @xmath79 . in particular , the ratios @xmath80 can change considerably from one choice of @xmath10 to another , although , in view of ( [ eq2.4 ] ) , @xmath80 is bounded away from zero and infinity as @xmath68 .    in the first part of theorem  [ the1 ] , below",
    ", we also impose the following condition on at least one of the ratios @xmath81 : @xmath82 as @xmath68 .",
    "[ the1 ] assume that @xmath83 for @xmath54 ; that @xmath76 is distributed on a lattice @xmath84 , for integers @xmath85 , where @xmath57 is the maximal lattice edge width ; and that ( [ eq2.4 ] ) holds .",
    "( )  if , for some pair @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 satisfies ( [ eq2.5 ] ) , then the one - term edgeworth expansion at ( [ eq2.2 ] ) holds uniformly in @xmath15 .",
    "( ) however , if @xmath88 equals a fixed rational number ( not depending on @xmath10 ) for each pair @xmath86 , and if the points @xmath89 can all be taken equal , then the expansion at ( [ eq2.2 ] ) fails to hold because it does not include an appropriate discontinuous term of size @xmath71 .      if @xmath90 is irrational , then @xmath91 for all integers @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq2.5 ] ) holds if @xmath88 converges to an irrational number as @xmath68 .",
    "however , in many cases ( [ eq2.5 ] ) holds without the sequence @xmath88 converging . for example , assume for simplicity that the lattice edge widths @xmath57 are all identical , let @xmath93 and @xmath94 be two distinct irrational numbers , and let the sequence of values of the ratio @xmath80 be a sequence of convergents of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , chosen so that an infinite number of convergents come from each @xmath95 .",

    "importantly , ( [ eq2.5 ] ) also holds in many cases where each @xmath88 is close to a rational number , indeed where each @xmath88 converges to a rational number . for example",
    ", we claim that ( [ eq2.5 ] ) obtains if @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , which can be either positive or negative , converges to zero strictly more slowly than @xmath98 : @xmath99 in this case , for each fixed , positive integer @xmath92 , @xmath100 from which it follows that @xmath101 where @xmath102 means that the ratio @xmath103 converges to 1 .",
    "assumption ( [ eq2.5 ] ) follows from ( [ eq2.6 ] ) and ( [ eq2.7 ] ) .",
    "a similar argument can be used to prove that if @xmath104 , where @xmath90 is a fixed rational number and @xmath97 satisfies ( [ eq2.6 ] ) , then ( [ eq2.5 ] ) is true .",
    "( the case @xmath105 is excluded by ( [ eq2.4 ] ) . )",
    "these examples make it clear that there is not a great deal of latitude in the assumption , imposed in part ( ii ) of theorem  [ the1 ] , that each @xmath88 should equal a fixed rational number . in particular , for ( [ eq2.5 ] ) to fail it is not sufficient that each @xmath88 converge to a rational .      in section  [ sec2.1 ] , we showed that , if ( [ eq2.5 ] ) holds , the discontinuous term of size @xmath71 , in expansions such as ( [ eq1.2 ] ) , is actually of smaller order than @xmath71 . to obtain a more concise bound on the discontinuous term , we shall investigate in detail cases where one or more of the ratios @xmath88 converge to an irrational number as @xmath10 diverges .",
    "however , this treatment requires a definition of the `` type '' of an irrational , and we give that next .",

    "it follows from roth s theorem ( roth @xcite ) that all algebraic irrationals ( that is , all irrational numbers that are roots of polynomials with rational coefficients ) are of minimal type , i.e. , @xmath114 , which is one of the cases we consider below .",
    "more generally , if a number is chosen randomly , for example as the value of a random variable having a continuous distribution on the real line , then with probability 1 it is an irrational of type  1 .",
    "irrationals that are not algebraic are said to be transcendental , and can have type strictly greater than 1 .",

    "<S> motivated by a problem arising when analysing data from quarantine searches , we explore properties of distributions of sums of independent means of independent lattice - valued random variables . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to determine the extent to which approximations to those sums require continuity corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in cases where there are only two different means , the main effects of distribution smoothness can be understood in terms of the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the respective maximal lattice edge widths of the two populations , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the respective sample sizes used to compute the means . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath5 converges to an irrational number , or converges sufficiently slowly to a rational number ; and in a number of other cases too , for example those where @xmath5 does not converge ; the effects of the discontinuity of lattice distributions are of smaller order than the effects of skewness . </S>",
    "<S> however , in other instances , for example where @xmath5 converges relatively quickly to a rational number , the effects of discontinuity and skewness are of the same size . </S>",
    "<S> we also treat higher - order properties , arguing that cases where @xmath5 converges to an algebraic irrational number can be less prone to suffer the effects of discontinuity than cases where the limiting irrational is transcendental . </S>",
    "<S> these results are extended to the case of three or more different means , and also to problems where distributions are estimated using the bootstrap . </S>",
    "<S> the results have practical interpretation in terms of the accuracy of inference for , among other quantities , the sum or difference of binomial proportions.=1 </S>"
