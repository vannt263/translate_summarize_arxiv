    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most important processes of plasma physics , and is believed to play the central role in observed phenomena in laboratory and cosmic plasmas . at the same time there has been a long - standing debate about the correct theoretical model of magnetic reconnection .",
    "most previous theoretical and numerical work focused on reconnection processes in two - dimensions , in which all physical scalars and vectors are independent of the third coordinate ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "there exist two original and well known models of magnetic reconnection with constant resistivity .",
    "first , the sweet - parker reconnection model  @xcite , which predicts a slow magnetic reconnection rate in hot low - density plasmas .",
    "second , the petschek model  @xcite , in which a fast reconnection rate is achieved by introducing switch - off magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks attached to the ends of a relatively short reconnection layer in the downstream regions .",
    "many numerical simulations have been carried out to discriminate between these two models .",
    "more recent high - resolution simulations generally favor the sweet - parker model of slow reconnection in the case of constant resistivity , and do not confirm the petschek theoretical picture for the geometry of the reconnection layer with shocks  @xcite .",
    "however , reconnection becomes much faster and petschek - like if resistivity is not constant and is enhanced locally in the reconnection layer ( numerical studies of this case were pioneered by ugai and tsuda  @xcite , by hayashi and sato  @xcite , and by scholer  @xcite ) .",
    "these results have been called into question in a recent paper , baty , priest and forbes ( 2006 )  @xcite , which claims that petschek reconnection can occur when the resistivity is not absolutely constant but varies by an arbitrarily small amount .",
    "this paper has motivated us show on the basis of an earlier paper of ours , malyshkin _ et  al@xmath1 _  @xcite , that the petschek shocks are produced not by the variation of the resistivity but by the rate of variation which for their case is very large and unlikely to happen naturally .    in 2001 kulsrud",
    "@xcite provided some theoretical insight into magnetic reconnection process which qualitatively explained the results of recent simulations .",
    "he considered quasi - stationary , two - dimensional magnetic reconnection in the classical sweet - parker - petschek reconnection layer with zero guide field ( @xmath2 ) , zero plasma viscosity and an anomalous resistivity that is a piecewise linear function of the electric current .",
    "kulsrud was first to suggest that one has to calculate the half - length of the reconnection layer @xmath3 from the mhd equations and the jump conditions on the petschek shocks , instead of treating @xmath3 as a free parameter ( as petschek erroneously did when chose @xmath3 to be equal to its minimal possible value under the condition of no significant disruption to the plasma flow ) .",
    "as a result , in the case of constant resistivity kulsrud correctly estimated the layer half - length @xmath3 to be approximately equal to the global magnetic field scale , @xmath4 . in this case the petschek reconnection rate reduces to the slow sweet - parker reconnection rate  @xcite , in agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "the second result obtained by kulsrud is that in the case when resistivity is non - constant but anomalous and enhanced ( e.g.  by plasma instabilities ) , the reconnection rate can become considerably faster than the sweet - parker rate .    in our recent paper ( malyshkin , linde and kulsrud  @xcite ) ,",
    "to which we will hereafter refer as mlk2005 paper , we put kulsrud s derivations on a rigorous analytical basis and extended his model by using a new theoretical approach to calculate the reconnection rate .",
    "this approach is based on `` local '' analytical derivations across a thin reconnection layer , and it is applicable to the case when resistivity is anomalous , nonuniform and an arbitrary function of the electric current and of the spatial coordinates .",
    "we included the case of non - zero guide field @xmath5 and non - zero plasma viscosity in our model .",
    "we found an approximate formula for the reconnection rate which confirmed kulsrud s theoretical results .",
    "the present paper has two goals .",
    "first , to calculate the reconnection rate , and second , to compare it with the recent simulations of baty _ et  al@xmath1 _  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we simultaneously follow two theoretical approaches to the calculation of the reconnection rate . in the first approach , which we call the `` global '' equations approach , we derive and solve approximate mhd equations for a whole reconnection layer , including the upstream and downstream regions and the layer center .",
    "these theoretical derivations are similar to those done before , except for an important difference .",
    "namely , we take into consideration an additional important equation , the spatial homogeneity of the z - component of electric field @xmath6 along the reconnection layer .",
    "this equation , together with the jump condition on petschek shocks , allows us to find the reconnection layer length @xmath3 , which must be determined consistently  @xcite .",
    "the second theoretical approach , which we call the `` local '' equations approach , basically coincides with the calculations done in the mlk2005 paper . in this approach",
    "we derive and solve approximate mhd equations across a thin reconnection layer , including only the upstream region and the layer center .",
    "both approaches give the same approximate formula for the reconnection rate , which is valid in the general case of an arbitrary nonuniform anomalous resistivity [ see eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) ] . using these two approaches",
    "simultaneously allows us to better understand the physics of a reconnection process .    in sec .",
    "[ localized_resistivity ] we pursue the second goal of this paper .",
    "we consider the case treated by baty _",
    "et  al@xmath1 _",
    "@xcite , when resistivity is a prescribed function of the two spatial coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( remember that we consider two - dimensional reconnection , so that no physical quantities depend on @xmath0 ) .",
    "we argue that our theoretical model is in agreement with the results of these recent simulations of reconnection by baty , priest and forbes  @xcite .",
    "this agreement contradicts their theoretical conclusion that petschek shocks exist with constant resistivity , and we explain why . finally , in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] we discuss our results .",
    "in this section we consider magnetic reconnection with nonuniform anomalous resistivity in the classical two - dimensional sweet - parker - petschek reconnection layer , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ] .",
    "the layer is in the x - y plane with the x- and y - axes being perpendicular to and along the layer respectively .",
    "the length of the layer is @xmath9 , which is approximately equal to or smaller than the global magnetic field scale @xmath10 that will be introduced below .",
    "the thickness of the layer , @xmath11 , is much smaller than its length , i.e.  @xmath12 .",
    "the classical sweet - parker - petschek reconnection layer is assumed to have a point symmetry with respect to its geometric center point  @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ] and reflection symmetries with respect to the axes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus , for example , the x- and y - components of the plasma velocities @xmath14 and of the magnetic field @xmath15 have the following simple symmetries : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ". there could be a pair of petschek shocks attached to each of the two reconnection layer ends in the downstream regions .",
    "because of the mhd jump conditions on the petschek shocks , there must be a nonzero perpendicular magnetic field @xmath20 in the downstream region at point  @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ]  @xcite .",
    "if the plasma viscosity is small , then the plasma outflow velocity @xmath22 in the downstream region at point  @xmath21 is approximately equal to the alfven velocity @xmath23 calculated in the upstream region at point  @xmath24 ( refer to fig .  [ figure_layer ] ) .",
    "the plasma inflow velocity @xmath25 in the upstream region at point  @xmath24 , outside the reconnection layer , is much smaller than the outflow velocity , @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the magnetic field @xmath27 at point  @xmath24 , outside the layer , is mostly in the direction of the layer ( i.e.  in the y - direction ) .",
    "now let us list four assumptions that we make about reconnection process .",
    "first , we assume that the characteristic lundquist number is large , which ( by our definition ) means that resistivity is negligible outside the reconnection layer .",
    "second , we assume the plasma flow is incompressible .",
    "third , for simplicity we neglect plasma viscosity .",
    "( the case of nonzero viscosity is treated in the mlk2005 paper  @xcite . )",
    "fourth , we assume the reconnection process is quasi - stationary .",
    "this is true if the reconnection is slow , @xmath28 , and that there are no plasma instabilities in the reconnection layer . for an incompressible viscousless plasma",
    "the assumption of slow reconnection is equivalent to the assumption that the reconnection layer is thin , @xmath29 .",
    "the above assumptions are standard in the sweet - parker and petschek reconnection models",
    ". please note that we make no assumptions about the values of the guide field @xmath30 .",
    "in other words , our derivations apply to what is called `` two - and - a - half dimensional '' reconnection .    for brevity",
    ", we use physical units in which the speed of light and four times @xmath31 are replaced by unity , @xmath32 and @xmath33   for magnetic field , @xmath34 for electric field , @xmath35 for electric current , and @xmath36 for resistivity . ] . in these units the mhd equations that we need to find the reconnection rate are as follows .",
    "faraday s law @xmath37 for the x- and y - components of magnetic field in two dimensions is e_z / y =- b_x / t0 , e_z / x = b_y / t0 , [ faradays_law_exact ] where @xmath38 because of the quasi - stationarity of reconnection . from eqs .",
    "( [ faradays_law_exact ] ) we see that the electric field z - component is constant in space , i.e.  @xmath39 is a function of time only .",
    "next , neglecting the displacement current in the framework of mhd , ampere s law for the z - component of the current is j_z=(**)_z = b_y / x - b_x / y .",

    "we consider @xmath42 to be a function of @xmath41 instead of the total current @xmath43 .",
    "this is because the electrical conductivity in the z - direction can be reduced by plasma instabilities due to large values of @xmath41 . ] .",
    "next , the equation for plasma acceleration along the layer in the y - direction is ( * v*)v_y=-(/y)[p+b_x^2/2+b_y^2/2 ] + ( * b*)b_y , [ acceleration_exact ] where @xmath44 is the constant plasma density , @xmath45 is the sum of the plasma pressure and the guide field pressure @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , we have _ x v_x+_y v_y=0,_x b_x+_y b_y=0 [ divergence_exact ] because the field and the velocity are divergence - free .",
    "now , from mhd equations  ( [ amperes_law_exact])([divergence_exact ] ) we obtain the following table of `` global '' and `` local '' equations for the reconnection layer :    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    here quantities with subscript @xmath47 are taken at the reconnection layer central point  @xmath13 , while quantities with the prime sign are taken at point @xmath21 in the downflow region ( refer to fig .",

    "this is a very important result because the reconnection layer global geometry can be very complicated ( e.g.  in turbulent plasmas ) .",
    "of course , there exists an indirect dependence of the reconnection rate on the field global properties because the local field configuration in the upstream region is determined by the field global configuration .",

    "the equations used in this approach are presented in the second column of table  [ table ] .",
    "we would like to point out that two of these equation play the key role in correct determination of the reconnection layer length @xmath3 and geometry .",
    "the first key equation is the jump condition on the petschek shocks , @xmath105 , whose importance was first pointed out by kulsrud  @xcite .",
    "the second key equation is the constancy of the electric field z - component along the reconnection layer , @xmath106 , which has been overlooked in the previous theoretical models ( e.g.  in the petschek model ) .",
    "third , for the case of a strong dependence of resistivity on the current , i.e.  when @xmath107 $ ] , our results , given by eqs .",
    "( [ pk_reconnection ] ) , coincide with the results obtained by kulsrud  @xcite .",
    "thus , both the `` local '' and `` global '' theoretical approaches confirm kulsrud s results and ideas , contrary to the doubts raised in paper by baty _",
    "et  al@xmath1 _  @xcite .",
    "fourth , we found that in the case of uniform or quasi - uniform resistivity the magnetic reconnection rate is the slow sweet - parker rate and not the fast petschek rate , see eqs .",
    "( [ sp_reconnection ] ) .",
    "this theoretical result follows from rigorous analytical derivations and agrees with numerical simulations . at the same time it contradicts the original petschek theoretical model .",
    "let us consider both the `` global '' and `` local '' analytical approaches in the case of a strictly uniform resistivity @xmath108 , and let us explain why the petschek reconnection layer geometry is not realized in this case .",
    "we take the `` global '' equations approach first . in the case of constant resistivity eqs .",
    "( [ taylor_expansion ] ) and  ( [ j_yy ] ) result in equation @xmath109 for the fractional drop of the @xmath61 term along the reconnection layer . on the other hand",
    ", the constancy of the electric field z - component along the reconnection layer implies that this fractional drop is @xmath110 , where we use the `` global '' equations on lines @xmath68 to  @xmath111 in the second column of table  [ table ] .",
    "these two equations agree only if @xmath4 , which means that the geometry of the reconnection layer is sweet - parker and not petschek .",
    "next , we take the `` local '' equations approach . in this `` local '' approach",
    "we prefer not to consider the reconnection layer geometry and any `` global '' parameters , such as the layer length @xmath3 , for the calculation of the reconnection rate .",
    "instead we argue as follows .",
    "refer to the `` local '' equations in the last column of table  [ table ] .",
    "equations on lines  @xmath69 , @xmath112 and  @xmath113 result in an estimate of the plasma outflow velocity derivative @xmath114 , see eq .",
    "( [ v_y_y ] ) .",
    "plasma acceleration equation on line  @xmath68 results in the upper estimate for the @xmath115 field derivative , @xmath116 . as a result",
    ", we can find the upper estimate for the reconnection current @xmath57 from the `` local '' equation on line  @xmath111 , which is the condition of constancy of the electric field z - component along the reconnection layer .",
    "if resistivity is uniform , this estimate turns out to be the sweet - parker value , @xmath117 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ sp_reconnection ] ) .",
    "in addition , if one estimates the reconnection layer length as @xmath118 , he / she would again recover the sweet - parker result @xmath4  @xcite . we conclude that in the case of constant resistivity both the `` global '' and `` local '' equations approaches consistently lead to the sweet - parker reconnection rate and the sweet - parker geometry of the reconnection layer ( @xmath4 ) .    finally , let us point out that whether reconnection is unforced ( free ) or forced does not matter for our results and conclusions .",
    "indeed , on one hand , in the case of unforced reconnection one solves eqs .",
    "( [ rate ] ) and  ( [ v_r ] ) for the current @xmath57 and for the reconnection velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the solution will depend on the magnetic field @xmath27 in the upstream region at point  @xmath24 . on the other hand , in the case of",
    "forced magnetic reconnection the reconnection velocity @xmath25 is prescribed and fixed . in this case the field @xmath27 in the upstream region should be treated as an unknown parameter , and eqs .",
    "( [ rate ] ) and  ( [ v_r ] ) are to be solved together in order to find the correct quasi - stationary values of @xmath57 and @xmath27 . in other words , in the forced reconnection case an initially weak outside magnetic field @xmath27 gets piled up to higher values until the resulting current @xmath57 in the reconnection layer becomes large enough to be able to match the prescribed velocity @xmath25 of magnetic flux and energy supply in the upstream region .",
