    "statistical mechanics has been well developed for equilibrium systems in the sense that one can , in principle , calculate the partition function and use it to calculate all the equilibrium thermodynamic quantities of a system . on the other hand , the unavailability of the analogy of a partition function for nonequilibrium systems means that nonequilibrium statistical mechanics remains a field in rapid development , attracting researchers to seek its fundamental principles .    in 1986",
    ", ziff , gulari , and barshad introduced the zgb model @xcite to study the phase transition properties of a particular nonequilibrium process : the formation of carbon dioxide from oxygen and carbon monoxide at a catalyst surface , @xmath5 oxygen ( @xmath6 ) and carbon monoxide ( @xmath7 ) gases ( g ) are supplied to a catalytic surface ( pt ) . here",
    ", the surface is modeled as a square lattice .",
    "when the oxygen molecule ( @xmath6 ) gets close to the surface , it decomposes into two oxygen atoms ( @xmath8 ) . each o atom and each co molecule",
    "independently forms a weak bond with an empty lattice site ( @xmath9 ) to become adsorbed ( ads ) .",
    "if a @xmath7 molecule and an @xmath8 atom are adsorbed at nearest - neighbor lattice sites , they immediately react and form a carbon dioxide molecule ( @xmath10 ) that leaves the surface .",
    "each lattice site can either be empty , occupied by one o atom , or occupied by one co molecule .",
    "the only control parameter in the model is the partial pressure of @xmath7 in the supplied gas , denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "the reaction was simulated by a dynamic monte carlo algorithm , revealing the occurrence of nonequilibrium phase transitions on the catalyst surface .",
    "it was found that the steady state of the catalyst surface strongly depends on the partial pressure of @xmath7 in the feed gas . in this original zgb model , when the @xmath7 partial pressure is small , the catalyst surface becomes completely occupied by o atoms in the long - time limit ( oxygen - poisoned phase ) .",
    "if the @xmath7 partial pressure is increased to a value , @xmath12 , a continuous phase transition occurs , beyond which the catalyst surface is covered by a mixture of @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and empty sites ( mixed phase ) . if one continues to increase the @xmath13 partial pressure @xmath11 , a first - order phase transition occurs at @xmath14 . beyond this transition ,",
    "the catalyst surface is completely covered by @xmath7 in the long - time limit ( @xmath7 poisoned phase ) .    it has further been noticed in experiments that adsorbed species can desorb from the surface without reacting .",
    "the reason for this is that when the temperature is sufficiently high , an adsorbed particle can gain enough energy to break its bond with the catalyst surface . as a consequence ,",
    "desorption rates increase with temperature .",
    "it was also found that the desorption rate of @xmath7 ( denoted as @xmath0 ) is much higher than that of @xmath8 atoms @xcite .",
    "the desorption rate @xmath0 of @xmath7 can be added to the model as a second control parameter @xcite .",
    "if a very small value of @xmath0 is chosen , there is no qualitative difference in the region of small @xmath13 partial pressure .",
    "but when @xmath15 , the positive desorption rate reduces the @xmath7 coverage , producing a nonzero density of vacancies .",
    "if the @xmath7 desorption rate @xmath0 is increased , a higher @xmath7 partial pressure , @xmath16 , is required for the first - order transition to occur .",
    "similar to an equilibrium lattice - gas system , moving along this first - order transition line in the phase diagram eventually leads to a critical point .",
    "it has been found that this critical point belongs to the two - dimensional equilibrium ising universality class @xcite .",
    "soon after the zgb model was introduced , a number of groups were attracted to study its phase transition properties @xcite .",
    "some modeled the catalyst surface as a hexagonal lattice instead of a square lattice @xcite .",
    "some studied the effects of oxygen atoms adsorbing at two non - neighboring sites ( ` hot ' dimer adsorption ) @xcite or as a result of nearest - neighbor repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "others considered diffusion of the adsorbed species @xcite , co - adsorption of the gas molecules ( meaning that the gas molecules can react directly with adsorbed species ) @xcite , and the effect of using a periodic @xmath13 pressure @xcite .",
    "some researchers also studied the effects of impurities present on the catalyst surface @xcite or in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "others again considered the detailed processes happening on the catalyst surface , building lattice - gas models including energetic effects , with energy barriers calculated from quantum mechanical dft calculations and/or comparison with experiments @xcite .",
    "a recent , comprehensive review of lattice - gas models for co oxidation on metal ( 100 ) surfaces is found in @xcite , and a review of critical behavior in irreversible reaction systems is found in @xcite .",
    "other nonequilibrium lattice - gas models with similar phase properties have also been studied @xcite .",
    "in equilibrium ising and lattice - gas models it is well known that the presence of sufficiently long - range interactions in the hamiltonian will change the universality class of the critical point that terminates the line of first - order transitions from the ising class to the mean - field class .",
    "given the similarity of the phase diagram of the zgb model with co desorption to that of a liquid - gas system ( which also belongs to the ising universality class ) , it is natural to ask whether the presence of a mechanism for long - range reactivity would change the universality class from ising to mean - field in the same way as long - range interactions do for the equilibrium case .",
    "a few studies indicate that this is the case .    in one study @xcite ,",
    "the ` hot dimer adsorption ' idea was handled by assuming that oxygen molecules are dissociated and adsorbed as nearest neighbors , but the non - reacted adsorbed oxygen atoms are allowed to undergo a ballistic flight for up to 20 lattice sites and react with any co located next to the trajectory .",
    "however , the conclusions of this study regarding universality did not appear very clear .",
    "much clearer results were obtained in a study by liu , pavlenko , and evans ( lpe ) @xcite , who considered a lattice - gas reaction - diffusion model similar to the zgb model with co desorption , in which adsorbed co molecules were allowed to diffuse to adjacent empty sites at a finite rate , @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to an effective diffusion length @xmath18 .",
    "in analogy with earlier studies of equilibrium ising systems of linear size @xmath19 with equal interaction constants of range @xmath20 , which derived a _ crossover parameter _ @xmath21 for two - dimensional systems @xcite , lpe obtained effective critical exponents from finite - size scaling analysis of monte carlo simulations . when plotted vs @xmath22 , their results showed good data collapse and a monotonic trend over about two decades of the crossover parameter from ising exponents for @xmath23 to mean - field for @xmath24 . in order to approach the mean - field limit @xmath25 in a computationally manageable way",
    ", they resorted to a hybrid model in which the co molecules were replaced by a uniform mean field .    in the present paper",
    "we approach the problem of determining the universality class of the critical point in a zgb model with co desorption and long - range reactivity along a different path that enables us to unambiguously extrapolate our results to the limit of infinite - range reactivity and infinite system size . for this purpose",
    "we utilize an analogy with an approach to the study of phase transitions in ising - like equilibrium systems with weak long - range interactions , which has recently been pursued in connection with modeling of spin - crossover materials with both local and elastic interactions @xcite . in this approach",
    ", long - range interactions were added as a perturbation of adjustable magnitude to an equilibrium ising system .",
    "@xcite considered a hamiltonian with both a ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interaction part ( ising model ) and a long - range ferromagnetic interaction part ( the husimi - temperley or equivalent - neighbor model in @xcite and elastic interactions in @xcite ) . in both cases they found that , upon the addition of long - range interactions of any nonzero magnitude , the universality class of the critical point changed abruptly from ising to mean - field .    here",
    "we modify the original zgb model analogously by introducing an adjustable probability that an o atom and a co molecule adsorbed far apart on the surface can react to form co@xmath26 and desorb .",
    "we use the random selection method of dynamic monte carlo @xcite and the crossing of the maximum fourth - order cumulants @xcite to study any resulting changes of the critical properties of the system . in agreement with the results for equilibrium ising systems @xcite",
    ", we find that the universality class of the critical point changes from the ising class to the mean - field class . in the process , we also obtain an estimate for the critical point of the zgb model without long - range reactivity which we believe to be more accurate than , but essentially consistent with , those obtained previously @xcite .    the long - range reactivity effect that we introduce here",
    "is not intended to model any particular , physical mechanism , but rather to provide a numerically tractable method to explore the effects of such long - range effects in general .",
    "however , it could be viewed as a simplified version of a rapid diffusion effect @xcite .",
    "alternatively , practical catalysts are usually made as highly porous materials resembling folded , crumpled surfaces , so that the supplied gas encounters a larger surface area per unit volume . in this kind of geometry",
    ", it may be possible that an adsorbed species desorbs and moves to another site , which is far away along the lattice surface , but close in the three - dimensional embedding space .",
    "our long - range reactivity model could also be viewed as a simplified model to describe such situations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our results and state our conclusions .",

    "( [ eq-1 ] ) @xcite , modified to allow desorption of @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) @xcite . in order to include a long - range reactivity of adjustable strength , the model is modified in the following way .",
    "when a newly adsorbed particle ( co or o ) can not find any partner particles among its nearest neighbors to react with ( o for co or co for o ) , it has a non - zero probability , @xmath28 , to check a randomly chosen site anywhere on the lattice .",
    "if this site is occupied by a partner particle , the two react to form co@xmath26 and desorb .",
    "in other words , a long - range reaction is considered only after the the possibility of a short - range reaction has been tested and found impossible .",
    "for @xmath29 , our model reduces to the standard zgb model with co desorption @xcite .",
    "( although it is known that the unphysical continuous phase transition at @xmath12 , i.e. the presence of the oxygen poisoned phase , can be eliminated by considering next - nearest neighbor adsorption instead of nearest- neighbor adsorption @xcite , here we stick to the original nearest - neighbor approach as our focus is the effect of introducing long - range reactivity on the phase transition at @xmath14 . )",
    "the details of our simulation algorithm are given below .",
    "our algorithm is based on the implementation of the random selection method of dynamic monte carlo used in ref .",
    "@xcite to simulate the standard zgb model with co desorption . in this method , the whole reaction process is divided into several processes . for each process",

    "a flow chart of the whole process is shown in fig .  [ fig_flow_chat_long_range ] .",
    "it can be broken down into several steps as follows .",
    "the long - range reactivity mechanism is step  6 , which can be reached from step  4a if the newly adsorbed particle is a co molecule , or from step  5 if the newly adsorbed particle is an o atom .",
