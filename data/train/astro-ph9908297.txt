    "the nature of the dominant power source in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter uligs ) has been the subject of intense debate , ever since their discovery in significant numbers by the all - sky survey carried out by the infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ ) .",
    "the debate has intensified once again following recent mid- and far - infrared spectroscopic observations of uligs by the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) , and is the main theme of this workshop .",
    "the scientific organizing committee ( soc ) asked the conference participants to form two teams ( with meeting rooms in the  blue tower \" and the  green tower \" ) charged with marshaling the evidence in favor of starbursts and agns respectively , in preparation for ending the conference with a  great debate \" .",
    "this article presents the evidence assembled by the  green team \" as to the fraction of the total bolometric luminosity of uligs that can reasonably be attributed to dust - enshrouded agns , and answers additional questions posed by the soc on the relevance of uligs to galaxy transformations .",
    "the soc proposed the following four topics for the debate :    4=",
    "@xmath1    much of the green tower discussion was devoted to topic 1 , which most participants had thought to be the main theme of the workshop .",
    "much of our time was spent focusing on the nearest and best studied uligs , and on comparing the observational evidence from across the electromagnetic spectrum for and against the presence of a dominant agn .",
    "topic 3 seemed to blend naturally with the discussion of topic 1 .",
    "discussion of topic 2 drew heavily on several large optical and near - infrared imaging studies of complete samples of low-@xmath2 _ iras _ galaxies , while topic 4 relied on more recent studies of a limited number of high-@xmath2 _ iras _ sources and sources recently identified in deep submillimeter images obtained with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba : holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea .",
    "the origin and evolution of uligs continues to be a subject of intense research , and one that has taken on renewed importance following new infrared / submillimeter results from _ iso _ and scuba / jcmt , and from new x - ray observations with _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , and _",
    "bepposax_. strong evolution in the space density of luminous infrared galaxies has been detected in the first deep mid - infrared surveys with isocam ( taniguchi et al . 1997 ; aussel et al . 1999 ) and deep far - infrared surveys with isophot ( kawara et al . 1998 ; puget et al . 1999 ) .",

    "in addition , the discovery that much of the x - ray background appears to be produced by a population of heavily obscured agn ( e.g. fabian & barcons 1992 ; boyle et al .",
    "1995 ; almaini et al .",
    "1998 ) , objects which have been largely missed in optical surveys due to extremely heavy obscuration along the line of sight ( e.g. @xmath4@xmath5 : maiolino et al .",
    "1998 ) has clearly renewed interest in studies of infrared - selected agn .",
    "it seems clear that detailed observations of nearby uligs are a required first step in order to better understand these objects , and in particular to unravel the nature of the dominant energy source responsible for their enormous infrared luminosity .",
    "given the evidence from millimeterwave interferometer observations which indicate large absorbing columns toward the nuclei of all uligs [ typically @xmath6@xmath5 : e.g. bryant & scoville 1996 ) , it has always seemed prudent to use a broad multiwavelength approach to study these sources , thus we welcome the new mid- and far - infrared _ iso _ data as the latest tool in the study of uligs .",
    "the four topics posed for the debate are answered in the order they were posed .",
    "the following definitions have been in wide use , and are adopted for the purpose of this debate :    @xmath7 : 0.35 in @xmath8    ulig : 0.18 in @xmath9 is equivalent to the minimum bolometric luminosity of a qso , i.e. @xmath10   which is equivalent to @xmath11 ( schmidt & green 1983 ) corrected for @xmath12kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14     and a bolometric correction for qsos of @xmath15 ( e.g. elvis et al .",

    "rqqso : 0.03 in radio - quiet quasi - stellar object ( @xmath19 )",
    "this was the advertised title of the workshop , and with appropriate rewording , became the first topic for the debate :    4=    @xmath1    we define the words `` most '' and `` predominantly '' in the way that they have been used throughout this workshop , i.e. to mean `` @xmath2050% '' .    from the beginning it seemed clear that the agn camp could relatively easily reach a consensus on dominant agns for those uligs with `` warm '' mid - infrared colors , nearly all of which have seyfert - like optical and/or near - infrared spectra , and for the most luminous uligs , i.e. the hyperluminous objects with @xmath21@xmath22 , where _ all _ of the currently identified objects indeed have `` warm '' colors and typically seyfert2 emission lines in direct optical emission ( e.g. iras f09105 + 4108 : kleinmann & keel 1987 ; iras f15307 + 3252 : cutri et al .",
    "1994 ; iras f10214 + 4724 : rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1991 ) , but have been shown to contain hidden broad line regions in polarized optical light ( e.g. hines et al .",
    "1995 ) , or in direct near - infrared emission ( e.g. veilleux , sanders , & kim 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "there was little or no agreement on the dominant energy source for the cooler uligs which make up the bulk of the ulig population by number .",
    "as more complete multiwavelength data sets were assembled for individual objects , what was intriguing was the fact that for a significant fraction of the cool uligs , different wavelength data often gave contradictory results ; for example relatively strong x - ray emission , or the clear presence of an agn - like radio core , while mid - infrared and optical line diagnostics favored starbursts .",
    "what was also apparent was that previous statements about agn - like properties of uligs often used as a benchmark objects which were radio - loud ( e.g. 3c sources such as 3c273 ) when referring to the mean radio and/or x - ray properties of agn , despite the fact that the great majority of qsos are _ radio - quiet _ and relatively x - ray week .",
    "it was decided that the best way to attack topic 1 was an in depth study of the five nearest uligs , objects for which a substantial body of high resolution , multiwavelength data already exists , and then to compare the properties of these objects with the mean properties of radio - quiet qsos ( rqqsos ) .",
    "figure 1 presents images of the 5 nearest uligs and table 1 summarizes the large scale properties of each .",
    "table 2 lists the radio  to  x - ray properties of the five nearest uligs , including the latest high - resolution radio data from the vla and vlba and x - ray data from asca .",
    "in addition to the extensive notes included with table 2 , a brief summary of properties by wavelength band is given below .",
    "one measure commonly used to distinguish starbursts from agn is the fir - to - radio correlation parameter @xmath23 ; starburst galaxies show a tight correlation around a value of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , while radio - loud agn often have values as small as @xmath260 to -1 .",
    "the majority of uligs have values of @xmath23 within the range @xmath27 , however _ so do the majority of rqqsos _ , which presents a problem when using a global parameter such as @xmath23 to distinguish starbursts from _ radio - quiet _ agn .    a more direct method of distinguishing agn from starbursts at radio wavelengths is to look for the presence or absence of a true high - brightness temperature agn - like radio core .",
    "vlba observations of rqqsos find typical radio - agn core fractions in the range of 2050% at 1.4ghz ( p. barthel and h. smith , private communication ) .",
    "two of the five uligs in table 2 ( mrk231 and ugc05101 ) have agn - core strengths within this range ; perhaps not surprisingly , these two objects also have the smallest @xmath23 values .    a somewhat unexpected finding is the detection with the vla of large scale ( i.e. 2050kpc ) radio `` plumes '' in three of the five uligs ( ugc05101 , mrk231 , mrk273 ) , similar to the bipolar plumes or extended jets seen in radio galaxies ( m. yun , this workshop ) suggesting the presence of a powerful radio - agn core in these objects .      the mid - infrared ( i.e. @xmath28@xmath29550@xmath30",
    "m ) begins to directly probe the dominant peak of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of uligs .",

    "1998 ) , and lutz et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) argue that the strength of the 7.7@xmath30 m pah line / continuum ratio can be used to determine the fraction of the infrared / submillimeter luminosity peak in seds that is due to a starburst and an agn respectively .",
    "using their arguments alone , two of the four uligs in table 2 ( mrk231 , mrk273 ) owe @xmath3150% of their far - infrared / submillimeter luminosity to an agn ( e.g. lutz et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "these authors also point out that there is evidence for  coexistence of central agn and circumnuclear star formation in a significant fraction of ( uligs ) \" , and they note that  the mid - infrared emitting regions are highly obscured ( @xmath32 ) for the screen case of @xmath33 for the fully mixed case ) . \" large optical depths ( i.e. @xmath34 ) along the line of sight toward the nuclei of uligs are indeed suggested by millimeterwave interferometer measurements of molecular lines ( e.g. scoville et al .",
    "1991 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; sakamoto et al . 1999 ) , as well as from the weakness of far - infrared spectral lines such as the 158@xmath30 m c@xmath35 line ( j. fischer , these proceedings ) which indicate optical depths of unity in uligs even at @xmath36@xmath30 m !    high spatial resolution measurements of uligs in the mid - infrared can potentially constrain the emitting size of the region responsible for the bulk of the mid - infrared luminosity in uligs .",
    "soifer et al . ( 1999 ) report that the bulk of the mid - infrared emission ( @xmath37@xmath291025@xmath30 m ) from arp220 comes from two very compact regions centered on the radio nuclei , each with diameter @xmath38200pc ( fwhm ) . both a very compact starburst and an agn can be modeled to fit the data , however as pointed out by soifer et al .",
    ", it becomes difficult to hide a @xmath39@xmath22 starburst in regions this small .",
    "strong emission lines such as pa@xmath40 and pa@xmath41 as well as high - excitation lines such as [ si vi ] can potentially be used to distinguish starbursts from agn .",
    "even if the extinction is still two large along the line of sight to observe emission lines from the central source , there is the potential for observing scattered emission in polarized light .",
    "two of the four uligs for which sensitive near - infrared spectra exist ( iras05189 - 2524 , mrk231 ) show clear evidence for polarized seyfert1 emission lines and [ si vi ] emission , further suggesting the presence of a strong agn .",
    "the use of standard line diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) show that three of the five uligs have seyfert spectra .",
    "both uligs with seyfert1 optical and/or mid - infrared spectra have @xmath42 ratios nearly identical to the mean observed ratio for uv - excess qsos , consistent with the hypothesis that the bulk of the bolometric luminosity in these infrared - dominated objects may indeed be due to a dust - enshrouded uv - excess qso .      like the radio ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is but a small fraction of the total bolometric luminosity of all starbursts and most agn , albeit usually a few orders of magnitude in @xmath43 larger than for the radio , but still several orders of magnitude less than the infrared luminosity of uligs .",
    "it is not clear that the observed x - ray spectrum can directly be related to the bolometric luminosity of uligs .",
    "however , by analogy with the mean x - ray properties of qsos or starbursts , it may at least be possible to say whether a qso - like x - ray nucleus is present .",
    "the 210kev luminosity of all five uligs in table 2 is weak relative to the strong far - infrared emission ( e.g. nakagawa et al .",
    "1999 ) ; however , _ the x - ray luminosity of uligs is not weak in relation to rqqsos when comparing the x - ray luminosity to the luminosity in the optical _ ( e.g. ogasaka et al .",
    "1997 ; iwasawa 1999 ; turner 1999 ) .",
    "strong absorption appears to affect both the optical / uv and soft x - rays in uligs , as might have been expected .",
    "absorption effects are minimized by considering only the hard x - ray emission , @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 , detected with _",
    "three of the five uligs were detected in hard x - rays , all at a level consistent with the mean hard x - ray luminosity observed for rqqsos [ note : mrk231 is compared here to the mean properties of balqsos which are somewhat weaker in their observed @xmath44 than other rqqsos ( turner 1999 ) . ]",
    "table 3 compares the properties of the five nearest uligs with the _ mean _ properties of rqqsos , in order to try to answer the question  is there evidence that @xmath2050% of the bolometric luminosity in @xmath2050% of uligs is due to an agn ?",
    "not surprisingly , perhaps , is that the two `` warm '' uligs ( iras05189@xmath472524 , mrk231 ) show substantial multiwavelength evidence for a dominant agn , but equally important is the fact that one additional object , mrk273 , is predicted by the starburst camp to contain a dominant agn ( lutz et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) , and another , ugc05101 , shows substantial evidence at radio wavelengths for harboring a powerful agn .",
    "what is perhaps most surprising is that arp220 appears to be alone in this small but well - studied group of the nearest uligs in it s absence of any clear signature of a dominant agn .",
    "rather than being the `` rosetta - stone '' for uligs , arp220 may simply be the nearest such object , and perhaps one of the most heavily obscured uligs as indicated by the extremely strong reddening in the optical and near - infrared , as well as evidence for extremely strong silicate absorption in the mid - infrared .",
    "have we shown that the answer to topic 1 is `` an agn '' ? if you take the five nearest uligs and adopt the bolometric luminosity indicator used by the starburst camp ( i.e. the 7.7@xmath30m / continuum ratio ) plus the bolometric luminosity indicator used by the agn camp ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , then 4 of the 5 uligs in table 3 are indeed dominated by an agn .",
    "however , our decision to focus only on those objets that have been observed at the broadest range of wavelengths , and with the highest resolution and sensitivity that current x - ray satellites and radio interferometers can provide , has produced a sample too small to statistically prove that @xmath2050% of _ all _ uligs are dominated by agn , thus our answer to topic 1 must be ...",

    "it is probably a fair summary of the `` green tower '' view that at least 2030% of uligs ( i.e. the `` warm '' objects ) already harbor a bonifide qso , and that a substantial fraction , if not all , of the cool uligs have the _ potential _ to eventually become qsos .",
    "of course there is no reason to believe that all uligs , once unshrouded , will necessarily reach the optical / uv luminosity associated with qsos  they may already have peaked in @xmath58 and/or some objects may simply be pure starbursts that for some reason never choose to build / fuel a massive black hole .",

    "the mean and range of the h - band luminosity of qso hosts , @xmath59 , reported by mcleod & rieke ( 1994 ) and mcleod , rieke , & storrie - lombardi ( 1999 ) are remarkably similar to the h - band luminosities of uligs ( e.g. review by sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "also , it has been known for some time that qso hosts often exhibit tidal features indicative of strong interactions / mergers [ e.g. stockton & mackenty 1983 : mackenty & stockton 1984 ( see the left panel in figure 4 ) ] , and more recent _ hst _ images of both radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos show clear signs of large scale tidal debris , circumnuclear knots , bars and rings ( e.g. mclure et al . 1999 ) similar to the inner structures seen in _ hst _ images of uligs ( e.g. surace et al .",
