    "the property of a quantum communication channel to convey quantum information is quantified in terms of the quantum capacity @xmath0 @xcite , which corresponds to the maximum number of qubits that can be reliably transmitted per channel use . in any realistic scenario noise",
    "is unavoidably present and the amount of information that can be transmitted is lower than in the ideal noiseless case .",
    "it is therefore important to develop efficient means to establish whether the channel can still be profitably employed for information transmission in the presence of noise , that may be completely unknown .    a standard method to infer the effect of noise on a communication channel relies on quantum process tomography @xcite , but this , however , is a demanding procedure in terms of the number of different measurement settings needed , since it scales as @xmath1 for a finite @xmath2-dimensional quantum system . in ref .",
    "@xcite a method was recently proposed to gain some information on the channel ability to transmit quantum information by employing a smaller number of measurements , that scales as @xmath3 . a lower bound on the quantum channel capacity was derived and it was shown that it can be experimentally accessed with a simple procedure .",
    "such a procedure can be applied to any unknown quantum communication channel .",
    "the efficiency of the method was tested for many examples of single qubit channels , and for the generalised pauli channel in arbitrary finite dimension .    in this paper",
    "we generalise this detection method to correlated qubit channels and test its efficiency in this case .",
    "correlated qubit channels were originally studied in terms of classical information transmission and it was shown that for certain ranges of the correlation strengths the use of entanglement allows one to enhance the amount of transmitted information along the channel @xcite . quantum memory ( or correlated ) channels then attracted growing attention , and interesting new features emerged by modeling of relevant physical examples , including depolarizing channels  @xcite , pauli channels  @xcite , dephasing channels  @xcite , amplitude damping channels @xcite , gaussian channels  @xcite , lossy bosonic channels  @xcite , spin chains  @xcite , collision models  @xcite and a micro - maser model  @xcite ( for a recent review on quantum channels with memory effects see ref .",

    "a lower bound @xmath28 to the quantum capacity of an unknown channel can then be detected by preparing a bipartite pure state @xmath14 and sending it through the channel @xmath29 , where the unknown channel @xmath4 acts on one of the two subsystems .",

    "moreover , one could also adopt an adaptive detection scheme to improve the bound ( [ qvec ] ) by varying the input state @xmath14 .",
    "since no information is given _ a priori _ about the communication channel , typically we always choose a maximally entangled input state , so that the reduced input @xmath15 has maximum input entropy .",
    "we will assume that only the local observables @xmath31 on the system and reference are measured , where @xmath32 is a tomographically complete set on the system alone .",
