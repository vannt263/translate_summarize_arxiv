    "lepton number @xmath5 is conserved in the standard model ( sm ) with massless neutrinos .",
    "however experimental data such as those coming from super - kamiokande @xcite or sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite showed evidence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "these experimental results imply lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) and the lepton sector of the sm requires an extension including massive neutrinos .",
    "since conservation of the lepton flavor number is not a law of nature that we rely on , it is significant to quest for new physics via lepton flavor violating effective operators .",
    "effective lagrangian extension of the sm could have an impact on particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "therefore it is crucial to investigate the physics potential of neutrino experiments to probe lfv .",
    "neutral - current lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath6 @xmath7 can be observable at colliders and effective operators contributing to these processes have been stringently constrained by collider experiments @xcite . on the other hand , in colliders neutrinos are not detected directly in the detectors . instead",
    ", their presence is inferred from missing energy signal .",
    "therefore it is impossible to detect a neutrino flavor at a collider and charged - current processes such as @xmath8 can not be discerned . in order to constrain lepton flavor violating couplings of neutrinos to @xmath0 boson ,",
    "beta beams provides an excellent opportunity .",
    "beta beams are electron neutrino and antineutrino beams produced via the beta decay of boosted radioactive ions @xcite .",
    "such decays produce pure , intense and collimated neutrino or antineutrino beams .",
    "purity of the neutrino beam make it possible to probe couplings @xmath9 with a high precision .    in the original beta beam scenario ion beams",
    "are accelerated in the proton synchrotron or super proton synchrotron at cern up to a lorentz gamma factor of @xmath10 , and then they are allowed to decay in the straight section of a storage ring .",
    "after the original proposal , different options for beta beams were investigated .",
    "a low gamma ( @xmath11 ) option was first proposed by volpe @xcite .",
    "physics potential of low - energy beta beams was discussed in detail .",
    "it was shown that such beams could have an important impact on nuclear physics , particle physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "higher gamma options for the beta beams have also been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "a higher gamma factor provides several advantages .",
    "firstly , neutrino fluxes increase quadratically with the gamma factor .",
    "secondly , neutrino scattering cross sections grow with the energy and hence considerable enhancement is expected in the statistics .",
    "an additional advantage of a higher gamma option is that it provides us the opportunity to study deep inelastic neutrino scattering from the nucleus . very high",
    "gamma ( @xmath12 ) options would require modifications in the original plan such as using lhc and therefore extensive feasibility study is needed . in this context medium energy setup",

    "we summarize the neutrino fluxes and the cross sections for quasielastic and deep inelastic scattering and present our main results .",
    "finally section iv includes concluding remarks .",
    "there is an extensive literature on non - standard interactions of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "new physics contributions to lepton flavor violating @xmath14 couplings can be investigated in a model independent fashion by means of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the theoretical basis of such an approach rely on the assumption that at higher energies beyond where the sm is valid , there is a more fundamental theory which reduces to the sm at lower energies .",
    "the sm is assumed to be an effective low - energy theory in which heavy fields have been integrated out .",
    "such a procedure is quite general and independent of the model at the new physics energy scale .",
    "specifically we consider the @xmath15 invariant effective lagrangian introduced in refs .",

    "we observe that neutrino spectrum extend up to 4 gev and antineutrino spectrum extend up to 2.5 gev .",
    "the energy range of the neutrino spectrum is comparably larger than the antineutrino spectrum",
    ". therefore number of events for antineutrinos is expected to be low .",
    "so we do not perform an analysis for antineutrinos . for neutrino energies between 0.5 - 1.5 gev ,",
    "dominant contribution to the cross section is provided by quasielastic scattering .",
