    "some very massive stars undergo sporadic luminous outbursts accompanied by episodic ejection of matter during their post - main - sequence evolution , in a few cases immediately before the final supernova ( sn ) explosion ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2008a , 2010a , 2010b ; smith & owocki 2006 ; gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) .",
    "strong evidence for this has been provided by observations of interacting supernovae ( type iin / ibn sne ) , the spectra of which exhibit relatively narrow ( narrow and `` intermediate width '' ) emission lines that are generated by the interaction between the sn blast wave and dense circumstellar material ( csm ) ejected by the stellar progenitor in the years to decades before the final explosion .",
    "depending on the nature of the star , the csm may be created via strong superwinds that last for millennia , in the case of extreme red supergiant progenitors ( smith et al .",
    "2009 ) , or by discrete outbursts that occur rapidly on month - to - year timescales ( see chugai et al .  2004",
    "; chugai & danziger 1994 ; smith et al .  2010a , 2008a ) .",
    "the episodic outbursts are reminiscent of luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars .",
    "several such events have been observed directly , including the historic eruption of @xmath8 carinae in our own galaxy during the mid-19th century ( smith & frew 2011 ) , as well as the more recently discovered extragalactic analogs , the so - called `` sn impostors '' ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ; smith et al .  2011 ) .",
    "these eruptive / explosive events can collectively liberate significantly more material than the total integrated mass lost via steady line - driven winds during the lifetime of a massive star ( smith & owocki 2006 ) , although the physical mechanism or trigger that causes the eruptions remains uncertain .",
    "the physics of this explosive mode of mass loss is poorly understood , and almost completely unaccounted for in current stellar evolution models .",
    "eruptive pre - sn mass loss from sn progenitors can be probed indirectly by observations of interacting sne . in the extraordinary case of the type ibn sn  2006jc , a pre - sn outburst from the progenitor",
    "was observed directly , two years before core collapse ( pastorello et al.2007 ) .",
    "the precursor outburst , observed only photometrically , was believed to be the source of dense csm emission and x - rays detected throughout the evolution of the sn spectrum ( pastorello et al .  2007 ; foley et al .  2007 ;",
    "smith et al .  2008b ; immler et al .",
    "owing to the h - poor abundances of the csm , the progenitor of sn  2006jc was believed to be a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star . since wrs are not typically associated with luminous outbursts ,",
    "the eruptive progenitor was suggested to have recently transitioned from the lbv phase into a wr ( foley et al.2007 ) . while lbvs provide the only known precedent for the eruptive pre - sn mass loss needed to make luminous sne  iin ( e.g. , smith et al.2010a , 2008a ) , this suggestion has been controversial because it directly contradicts current expectations of standard stellar evolution models ( heger et al .",

    "2010b ; drake et al.2010 ) .",
    "archival images from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ revealed a luminous blue progenitor at the location of the transient , having photometry consistent with a stellar luminosity of log@xmath9 and an initial mass of 5080m@xmath0 , indicating that the source is likely to be an lbv ( smith et al .",

    "2011 ) . while narrow lorentzian emission - line profiles indicated that most of the ejected mass was expanding at around 600kms@xmath2 , higher speeds _ seen only in absorption _ suggested a small amount of ejecta moving at speeds up to @xmath10kms@xmath2 or more ( smith et al .",

    "the earliest reports on the spectrum of sn  2009ip for the 2012 outburst ( foley et al .",
    "2012 ) stated that it was apparently consistent with previous lbv - like outbursts of the same object ( smith et al .",
    "2010b ; foley et al .",
    "however , this situation soon changed .",
    "a few weeks later , we observed the emergence of the broad - line spectra that signaled the onset of the sn explosion ( smith & mauerhan 2012a ) .",
    "the broad emission components are quite significant  the fwhm of 8000kms@xmath2 for the broad emission lines implies that a substantial fraction of the outflowing mass has achieved these high velocities , which is beyond the capabilities of any nonterminal super - eddington wind - driven mechanism ( owocki et al .",
    "no other known sn impostor has ever exhibited such high bulk ejecta speed .",
    "typically , impostors exhibit much slower outflow speeds of 3001000kms@xmath2 ( smith et al .  2011 ) .",
    "the highest - velocity material detected outside @xmath8  car s homunculus nebula only reaches @xmath10kms@xmath2 ( smith 2008 ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the fastest material in @xmath8  car traces only a tiny fraction of the outflowing mass ( less than 1% ; smith 2008 ) , most of which expands at a much slower speed of @xmath55kms@xmath2 .",
    "emission from the fastest material would not dominate the shape of balmer emission - line profiles in the optical spectrum , as seen during the 2012 outburst of sn  2009ip , even before the source brightened to normal sn luminosity .",
    "therefore , the appearance of broad spectral features , particularly the broad emission , signals the direct _ transition _ of sn  2009ip from an lbv - like eruption into a true core - collapse sn  iin .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the similarities between the broad spectral components of sn  2009ip and those of other sne  ii - p , such as sn 2005cs , illustrated in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] . in this interpretation , the broad spectral components of sn  2009ip probably represent the photosphere within the rapidly expanding sn ejecta that is seen through the csm , while the narrow emission components could be generated by interaction of the fastest sn ejecta with the csm ejected during the prior eruptions over the past few years , or ionisation of the csm by the sn .",
    "sn  2009ip thus joins sn  2006jc as the second example of a massive star that was actually observed to undergo a luminous outburst immediately before core collapse .",
    "the fact that both objects exhibit narrow lines from dense csm provides strong support for the conjecture that the csm of sne  iin can be produced by eruptive precursor events .",
    "sn  2009ip would have significant added importance , however , since the first outburst was studied in detail , including high - quality spectra ( smith et al .  2010b ; foley et al .",
    "2011 ) , and a luminous blue progenitor star was detected in archival _ hst _ images ( smith et al .",
    "2010b ) .    following our initial announcement of high velocities in sn  2009ip ( smith & mauerhan 2012a ) , two preliminary reports presented optical photometry which was interpreted as indicating that the most recent outburst of sn  2009ip was not a true sn ( margutti et al .",
    "2012a ; martin & obrien 2012 ) .",
    "it was claimed that the peak absolute magnitude of around @xmath314.5 mag ruled out a core - collapse event .",
    "this conclusion now seems premature , however , since sn  2009ip then rapidly rebrightened to luminosities consistent with a core - collapse explosion after all , eventually reaching a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath318 .",
    "as shown by our light curve in figure  [ fig : lca ] , the initial outburst reported in july 2012 was evidently a 5060 day precursor event that was interrupted by a sn explosion .      in this section ,",
    "we focus on the nature of the immediate precursor outburst in 2012 ( before the jump in brightness @xmath56 days after the july 24 rediscovery ) , and we discuss physical scenarios that could potentially explain sn  2009ip s behaviour at this early stage .    while an absolute magnitude of around @xmath314.5 mag during this phase did indeed indicate that sn  2009ip was fainter than _ normal _ core - collapse sne , there is a class of faint sne  ii - p with comparably faint luminosities ( pastorello et al .",
    "the least luminous of these faint sne  ii - p is sn  1999br , which has a peak of roughly @xmath314.2 mag , slightly fainter than the initial 2012 outburst of sn  2009ip .",
    "relatively low initial luminosities and slow rise times have also been observed during the early phases other sne .",
    "such behaviour was observed from sn  1987a , and was explained as the result of an explosion from a blue progenitor with a relatively compact stellar radius ( arnett 1989 , and references therein ) . in an explosion of a compact massive progenitor , the sn might be faint initially due to adiabatic losses .",
    "ruling out a core - collapse event altogether for the precursor outburst of sn  2009ip , based simply on brightness at early times , is not easily justifiable .",
    "a relatively faint transient might also result from a weak or `` failed '' sn , whereby the collapsing core forms a black hole . in such a scenario , the absence of neutrinos leads to a weak explosion that is unable to completely explode the star , and so most of the @xmath57ni and much of the star s core falls back into the black hole ( heger et al .",
    "this is expected to produce a transient source that is fainter than a normal core - collapse event .",
    "fryer et al . (",
    "2009 ) predict that such events should have peak magnitudes in the range @xmath58 to @xmath59 mag , comparable to what has been measured for the first 2012 outburst of sn  2009ip . with some asymmetry in the explosion mechanism",
    ", this may provide a means to accelerate a small fraction of the mass in the star s envelope to very high speeds .",
    "however , given the subsequent sharp rise to very high luminosities shortly after broad lines were seen , this scenario seems unlikely for sn  2009ip .",
    "a much more likely interpretation is that the 2012 precursor outburst of sn  2009ip was the result of yet another eruptive phase similar to its previous outbursts , which in this case occurred immediately before core collapse .",
    "the maximum of @xmath60 mag achieved just prior to the large jump in brightness around sep .",
    "25 is typical of the peak luminosities of suspected sn impostors ( see smith et al .  2011 , and references therein ) , and is the same as the previous lbv - like outbursts of sn  2009ip itself .",
    "this could explain why the sn was initially so faint , as the mass outflow from the preceding nonterminal outburst(s ) could have partially obscured the sn temporarily .    indeed , there may be theoretical reasons to suspect a nonterminal stellar outburst immediately before core collapse .",
    "for example , since the quiescent progenitor was thought to be a very massive star of 5080m@xmath0 ( smith et al .",
    "2010b ) , it is close to the regime where the pulsational pair instability could occur ( heger & woosley 2002 ; heger et al .",
    "2003 ; chatzopolous & wheeler 2012 )",
    ". the instability could give rise to repeated , explosive bouts of oxygen burning , following by eruptive mass ejections during the few years preceding core collapse .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2010a ) noted that the variations of the pulsational pair instability are essentially indistinguishable ( observationally ) from the properties of giant lbv - like eruptions .",
    "alternatively , explosive nuclear flashes associated with oxygen or silicon burning can potentially occur near the time of core collapse ( woosley et al . 1973 ; smith et al .",
    "2011 ) , perhaps driven by fluctuations in turbulent kinetic energy ( arnett & meakin 2011 ) .",
    "wave - driven mass loss associated with those late nuclear burning phases could also be important ( quataert & shiode 2012 ) .",
    "whatever the cause of the 2012 precursor outburst during july / august , the onset of very broad line emission by 2012 sep .",
    "717 signals that a clear change in the star had occurred _ before _ the subsequent jump in brightness near sep . 25 .",
    "if sn  2009ip had not yet become a sn by the time the broad - line emission spectrum appeared , then the event would be even more difficult to understand , since we would need to invoke some nonterminal mechanism that is capable of accelerating the bulk of the stellar envelope to speeds in excess of 8000kms@xmath2 , and up to 20,000kms@xmath2 ( see figure  [ fig : spec_he ] ) , far in excess of the escape velocity from the star s surface  but without causing the star to brighten yet .",
    "it seems more likely that the appearance time of broad - line emission marks the initial stages of a terminal sn explosion , to which the subsequent jump in brightness is causally linked .      beginning near 2012 sep .",
    "25 , sn  2009ip underwent another dramatic increase in brightness ( brimacombe 2012 ) , rapidly reaching much higher luminosities , eventually peaking at @xmath61mag in the @xmath14 band ( @xmath29 mag ; @xmath62 ) . during the rise , the broad balmer lines in the spectrum diminished , and they changed into narrower lorentzian profiles ( smith & mauerhan 2012b ; figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "this spectral morphology resembles the early - time spectra of other luminous sne  iin , such as sn  2006gy , sn  2006tf , sn  1994w , and sn  2011ht , all of which exhibited broad - winged lorentzian profiles during their early phases as a result of electron scattering in the dense sn - csm interaction zone , while masking the broad lines from the underlying fast sn ejecta ( smith et al .",
    "2010a , 2008a ; chugai et al .",
    "2004 ; mauerhan et al .",
    "strong sn - csm interaction is often accompanied by the formation of an opaque , cool dense shell ( cds ) that forms in the post - shock medium , and this would explain the almost complete extinguishing of the broad - lined component in the spectra , as the inner high - velocity ejecta would be masked by an opaque shell .",
    "the detection of the broad balmer lines immediately preceding the rapid increase in brightness on sep .",
    "25 suggests a causal link between this event and the precursor outburst , such that the sn had actually begun _ before _ the dramatic brightness jump shown in figure  [ fig : lca ] .",
    "we therefore favour the interpretation that the sn explosion had begun by the time we first detected the emergence of broad - line emission spectrum on 2012 sep . 7 , and perhaps even earlier .",
    "this was well after the onset of the precursor lbv - like eruption . in this picture , the subsequent brightness jump on sep .",
    "25 is dominated by the onset of intense csm interaction , as the fast ejecta from an already - occurring sn caught up to the slower material ejected during previous outbursts .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference in expansion velocities between the previous lbv - like outbursts ( 6001000kms@xmath2 ) and the most recent event ( 13,000kms@xmath2 ) would suggest a delay of 12 months for the fastest ejecta to begin overtaking the slower material , which would imply an approximate explosion date between aug .",
    "7 and near the time of discovery in mid - july . as reported by foley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , however , a spectrum taken on aug .",
    "26 apparently did not reveal the broad - line spectrum that we see emerging by sep . 7",
    " but if another lbv - like outburst was taking place at the time of supernova explosion , as we have speculated , then it is possible that an optically thick outflow generated by that event could temporarily mask the high - velocity ejecta from the emerging sn .    the temporary appearance of very broad he  i profiles by oct .",
    "16 ( figure  [ fig : spec_he ] ) , just after peak brightness , indicates a very dynamic interaction between the sn explosion and csm .",
    "he  i could have been excited as the radiation field from the shocked sn / csm interface hardened temporarily , perhaps as a result of the sn ejecta encountering a slower shell of csm or a gap between csm shells .",
    "indeed , the blue continuum becomes very strong at this stage ( figure  [ fig : spec_he ] ) .",
    "the hard uv and x - ray radiation from the interaction shock would also shine inward , exciting he  i in the fast sn ejecta , thus explaining the broad components of the he  i emission that we temporarily observe on oct .",
    "i emission would then fade as the radiation field softened .",
    "the evolving collision between a sn and the csm , which comprises mass outflows from multiple ( at least three ) previous ejections , is potentially quite complicated , and nonspherical geometry is probably important in the details of the brightness and spectral evolution .",
    "the small temporary luminosity increase that occurred after the light curve had begun to decline ( near day 100 in figure  [ fig : lca ] ) potentially indicates the onset of interaction with another mass shell or density enhancement farther out in the csm .",
    "the nature of the strong double - absorption feature in the range 56005800   that develops strongly by nov .",
    "24 is puzzling .",
    "however , the development of strong broad ca  ii around the same time suggests that na  i is a potential contributor , as these are both signatures of metal - rich sn ejecta .",
    "the evolution of he  i p - cygni emission could also have a significant effect on the morphology of this absorption complex . in any case , we refrain from further detailed analysis of this feature at this time .",
    "indeed , the interaction of sn ejecta with multiple shells of csm , in adition to a potentially asymmetric geometrical configuration , will undoubtedly result in a complicated system of emission components from multiple zones of shocked csm and sn ejecta , requiring more detailed analysis .      our ability to detect very broad lines just before the main brightening perhaps indicates that the csm was partially transparent at first , compared with some other sne  iin such as sn  1998s ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ) , sn  2006gy ( smith et al 2007 , 2010a ; ofek et al .",
    "2007 ) , sn  2006tf ( smith et al .",
    "2008a ) , sn  1994w ( sollerman et al . 1998",
    "; chugai et al . 2004 ) , and sn  2011ht ( mauerhan et al .",
    "all of these sne had dense csm that was opaque to the observational signature of any inner high - velocity ejecta  _ but no sn  iin has ever been observed in the weeks before it brightened _ , because in all previous cases the sn was not discovered and monitored until it had already begun to brighten substantially .",
    "thus , we have no precedent for comparison with sn  2009ip .",
    "perhaps many sne  iin go through a very early phase when their csm is transparent , before it is ionised by the csm interaction and before the sn brightens .",
    "the early detection of broad lines could simply be due to the fact that we caught sn  2009ip remarkably close to the time of core collapse .",
    "this could also be the case if the ejections associated with the prior outbursts in 2009 and 2010 had a relatively low mass compared with the outflows of other sn impostors , or if the csm had a small geometric covering factor due to a highly clumped csm or highly nonspherical geometry ( e.g. , a disk or bipolar shell ) .",
    "if so , the progenitor could be an lbv - like star that underwent mass eruptions similar in scale to those of p - cygni , which has a nebular mass of only @xmath63m@xmath0 ejected over 10yr ( smith & hartigan 2006 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with more massive lbv ejection nebulae , such as @xmath8  car s homunculus or the pistol nebula , both of which have masses of @xmath64m@xmath0 ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ; figer et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we can use the kinematic information from our spectra combined with the observed luminosity to constrain the parameters of the csm .",
    "the wind - density parameter , which is defined the ratio of the mass - loss rate ( @xmath65 ) and the csm velocity ( @xmath66 ) , can be expressed as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the velocity of the sn ejecta and @xmath69 is the luminosity . using the peak luminosity @xmath70 , and taking the fwhm of 8000kms@xmath2 of the broad h@xmath52 emission line as the average value of @xmath68 , implies a wind - density parameter of @xmath71gcm@xmath2 . the absorption - trough minimum of the narrow h@xmath52 p - cygni component from the nov .  6",
    "spectrum indicates that @xmath73kms@xmath2 , implying a mass - loss `` rate '' on the order of @xmath74yr@xmath2 for the pre - sn outburst that created the csm .",
    "these values are to be taken with caution , however .",
    "after all , the csm around sn  2009ip is likely to be a complicated system , judging by the persistent and rather chaotic variations and outbursts that have been observed over the last decade .",
    "upon close inspection , though , there does appear to be some evidence for a velocity gradient in the csm .",
    "for the narrow he  i @xmath475876 component seen on oct .",
    "16 , the @xmath51kms@xmath2 velocity of the absorption minimum in the p - cygni profile is slightly lower than the value of @xmath75kms@xmath2 that we measured for the narrow h@xmath52 component on nov .",
    "6 . since the later spectrum traces material further out in the csm ,",
    "the observed velocity gradient may suggest hubble - like expansion for the csm , which we might expect for an lbv mass ejection ( see , e.g. , smith et al .  2010a , where this was seen in the case of sn  2006gy ) .",
    "there are a few plausible suggestions for the physical nature of the precursor variability during the past few years .",
    "the most likely scenario is that the 2009 and 2010 outbursts have the same underlying cause and mechanism as the 2012 precursor outburst . as noted above",
    ", possibilities include the pulsational pair instability mechanism or outbursts associated with late stages of nuclear burning . however , an important clue about the cause of sn  2009ip s earlier 2009 and 2010 eruptions might be the short timescale over which they occurred . those outbursts lasted for only a few days to weeks , which is distinct from the much longer lasting outbursts of most other sn impostors ( see smith et al .  2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "such short timescales suggest a dynamical mass ejection event , rather than a wind - driven event .",
    "the rapid fluctuations are similar to the variations observed from the highly variable and recurrent transient sn  2000ch ( pastorello et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the physical reasons for such rapid , large - amplitude variability are uncertain , but one possibility we might consider is the close periastron passages of a companion star in an eccentric binary system ( smith 2011 ) . this might occur if a companion plunges into the bloated envelope of an lbv primary , the radius of which may be highly variable ( the change in radius governs whether the violent interaction occurs ) .",
    "this was suggested by smith ( 2011 ) as a potential explanation for @xmath8  car s brief brightening events in 1838 and 1843 , both of which occurred within weeks of periastron encounters ( smith & frew 2011 ) .",
    "one would expect such encounters to form a very nonspherical distribution for the csm ( like a disk or torus ) , possibly helping to explain the variable transparency to emission from the inner high - velocity ejecta in sn  2009ip , as noted above .",
    "whether such collisional events could help trigger core collapse , however , remains unknown .",
    "although the exact causes for the complex pre - sn evolution of sn  2009ip remain uncertain , the opportunity to spectroscopically observe such a unique object in the days before it became a sn was truly remarkable .",
    "our observations provide dramatic confirmation of recent conjectures that suggest a link between lbv - like eruptions and the class of sne  iin that are dominated by csm interaction ( smith & owocki 2006 ; smith et al .  2010a , 2008a , 2007 ; gal - yam et al .  2007 ; gal - yam & leonard 2009 )",
    "moreover , the explosion of sn  2009ip confirms that lbv stars can explode as sne before becoming wolf - rayet stars , which previously was not expected from stellar models ( e.g. , langer et al .",
