    "radio pulsars can be broadly classified into two categories : ( a ) isolated pulsars with rotation periods usually above 1 s and very strong magnetic fields ( @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath2  g ) ; and ( b ) binary / millisecond pulsars with much shorter rotation periods and considerably weaker magnetic fields ( @xmath3  @xmath4  g ) .",
    "observational indications have led to the proposal of a unified model in which these two types of pulsars are regarded as two phases in the evolutionary history of neutron stars ( see bhattacharya 1995 , 1996 ; van den heuvel 1995 ; verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 and references therein ) . according to this model , a normal pulsar ,",
    "if it is in a binary system , may undergo mass accretion from its binary companion for a limited period , and the angular momentum of the accreted matter may spin up the neutron star , ultimately making it appear as a millisecond pulsar after the accretion process stops . in this scenario , neutron stars seen in the x - ray as members of binary systems should correspond to the intermediate phase of transition from the normal pulsar phase to the millisecond pulsar phase .",
    "the fact that many millisecond pulsars are found in binary systems lends credence to this picture .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then the most natural explanation of the weaker magnetic fields of millisecond pulsars must be that the magnetic field of a neutron star is significantly reduced during the accretion phase .",
    "though , how this happens is still not understood very well .",
    "+ a variety of models have been proposed for the evolution of the magnetic field in an accreting neutron star ( see bhattacharya 1999a , 1999b ; konar & bhattacharya 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "there are two classes of models which have been mainly explored in this context : one that relates the magnetic field evolution to the spin evolution of the star and the other attributing the field evolution to direct effects of mass accretion . the different classes of models usually assume different kinds of initial field configurations .",
    "models depending on spin - down assume a core - flux supported by proton superconductor flux tubes .",
    "on the other hand , models invoking ohmic dissipation usually assume an initial crustal configuration .",
    "the mechanism of ohmic decay , being unique to the crustal currents , is also used in models where spin - down is invoked for flux expulsion , for a subsequent dissipation of such flux in the crust ( jahan miri & bhattacharya 1994 ; bhattacharya & datta 1996 , konenkov & geppert 200 , 2001a , 2001b ) . in an accretion - heated crust ,",
    "the decay takes place principally as a result of rapid dissipation of currents due to the decrease in the electrical conductivity and hence a reduction in the ohmic dissipation time scale ( geppert & urpin 1994 ; urpin & geppert 1995 ; urpin & geppert 1996 ; konar & bhattacharya 1997 ) .",
    "+ however , in this context one of the least investigated mechanisms that has often been invoked is the possible screening of the field by accreted material .",
    "the idea of a possible screening of the magnetic field of a neutron star by accreting material was first proposed by bisnovatyi - kogan & komberg ( 1974 ) .",
    "later , taam & van den heuvel ( 1980 ) indicated that the accreted matter , which is completely ionized plasma and hence diamagnetic in nature , might screen the pre - existing field , reducing its strength at the surface .",
    "blandford , de campli & knigl ( 1979 ) suggested that the material accreting onto the poles will be confined by the strong magnetic stresses near the surface of the star . at low accretion rates",
    ", the material sinks below the stellar surface until the hydrostatic pressure of the stellar material is as large as the magnetic pressure .",
    "the plasma then flows sideways giving rise to horizontal components at the expense of the vertical field and may result in a decrease in the observed field strength .",
    "then it was shown by woosley & wallace ( 1982 ) and hameury , bonazzola , heyvaerts & lasota ( 1983 ) that the accretion column is like a small mountain on the polar cap rather than being subsurface .",
    "semi - quantitative calculations by romani ( 1990 , 1995 ) showed that hydrodynamic flows in the surface layers may bury the field to deeper layers , effectively reducing the surface strength .",
    "+ when the accreting material flows horizontally from the polar caps to lower latitudes , magnetic field lines are expected to be dragged by the flow , giving rise to distortions in the original field structure .",
    "this may lead to creation of additional horizontal components of the field at the expense of the vertical ones .",
    "now , horizontal magnetic fields are known to be subject to magnetic buoyancy ( see , for example , parker 1979 , ",
    "although the flow of accreting matter tries to screen the magnetic field , the field may pop back to the surface due to magnetic buoyancy ( spruit 1983 ) and ohmic re - diffusion . the magnetic loops coming out to the surface due to buoyancy would reconnect with overlying field lines and thereby would make the screening ineffective .",
    "simple estimates by konar ( 1997 ) showed that the instability or the reconnection time scales happen to be too small for the screening mechanism to be effective .",
    "similar conclusion , as for the re - diffusion time - scale being of the order of @xmath5 years , have been reached by geppert , page & zannias ( 1999 ) , in the context of the hyper - critical accretion onto a newly born neutron star and the re - emergence of its surface field .",
    "+ it seems at the first sight that the accreting material will not be able to screen the magnetic field of the neutron star . in particular , for higher rates of accretion , effects such as magnetic buoyancy and ohmic diffusion might make the magnetic field emerge to the surface , rapidly , through the accreting matter .",
    "we , however , argue here that this is a complex problem of competing time scales and one has to do more detailed calculations , than what has been done previously , to settle the question of screening of the magnetic field by accreted matter . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no attempt has so far been made to investigate this problem in a 2-dimensional framework and ours is the first 2-d calculation of the problem .",
    "some of the results we present here depend crucially on the 2-d geometry and could not have been obtained by simpler 1-d calculations .",
    "+ the accreted material flowing from the polar caps would meet near the equator .",
    "this is expected to cause a submergence of such material under the surface over a belt around the equator . even though it is difficult to say anything definite about the flow of the accreted material in the surface layers of the neutron star , without considering the navier - stokes equation including a reasonable viscosity ; we do not really expect a pile - up of material in the equatorial region .",
    "hence we expect that the submerging material would push against the solid interior of the neutron star and would displace the solid layers .",
    "our rough estimates suggest the speed of this displacement of the solid interior to be @xmath6 cm s@xmath7 for eddington accretion rates  comparable to the speeds of tectonic plates on the earth s surface which are again @xmath6 cm s@xmath7 ( see , for example , emiliani 1992 ,  12.2 ) .",
    "we propose that the solid inner material in the equatorial region , while remaining solid , is displaced very slowly downwards as well as sideways to higher latitudes in the form of a counter - flow to the equator - ward flow of accreted material at the surface .",
    "this very slow movement of the solid material would carry the magnetic field with it , since magnetic buoyancy would be ineffective in a region where the material is solid . the time taken by this very slow motions to cover an appreciable distance inside the neutron star is @xmath8 years .",
    "our 2-d calculations show that , in presence of accretion , the magnetic field can be screened in the time scale of this very slow interior motions of the solid material .",
    "once the accretion is turned off , the submerged field should start re - diffusing to the outer layers .",
    "+ although our present work is the first quantitative study of the effect on magnetic field of a flow in the meridional plane in the context of neutron stars , the effect of a meridional flow on solar magnetic fields has been studied in some detail ( dikpati & choudhuri 1994 , 1995 ; choudhuri & dikpati 1999 ) .",
    "some recent models of the solar dynamo depend on the existence of a meridional flow in the solar convection zone in a very crucial way ( choudhuri , schssler & dikpati 1995 ; durney 1995 , 1997 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; nandy & choudhuri 2001 ) .",
    "our work derives its methodology from the models developed by the authors mentioned above .",
    "+ the mathematical formulation of the problem is discussed in the next section .",
    "although we have run our code over a wide range of parameters , our code can not handle the extreme values of parameters appropriate for the crust of a neutron star .",
    "the density varies in the outer layers of the neutron star by 8 orders of magnitude ; the accreted material flows through a layer of thickness equal to 1% of the radius of the neutron star and the time scales of motion and ohmic decay again differ by 8 orders of magnitude ! in  3 , we present some general results obtained with more moderate values of the parameters to understand the basic physics and show that one can draw some fairly generic , parameter - independent conclusions .",
    "the lessons learnt from this general study are extrapolated to the situation of the neutron star in  4 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "the magnetic field of the neutron star will evolve according to the well - known induction equation : = ( ) - ( ) , [ eq_ind ] where @xmath9 is the electrical conductivity of the medium ( see , for example , parker 1979 ; choudhuri 1998 ) .",
    "we assume an axisymmetric poloidal field which enables us to represent the magnetic field in the following form , = .",
    "[ eq_vec ] it is easy to show that the magnetic field lines are given by contours of constant @xmath10 . on substituting eq.([eq_vec ] ) in eq.([eq_ind ] ) , we find that @xmath11 evolves according to the equation : + ( . ) ( s a ) = ( ^2 - ) a , [ eq_dadt ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear from eq.([eq_dadt ] ) that only the poloidal component of @xmath14 affects the evolution of @xmath11 .",
    "+ to study the evolution of the magnetic field by solving eq.([eq_dadt ] ) , we need to know the velocity field @xmath14 .",
    "it is an extremely non - trivial problem to calculate the velocity field @xmath14 of the accreted material from the basic principles of fluid mechanics .",
    "we , therefore , follow the kinematic approach of specifying a velocity field @xmath14 which has the required characteristics and then study the effect of this velocity field on the initial magnetic field .",
    "the material accumulated in the polar regions would cause an equator - ward flow at the surface in both the hemispheres .",
    "let us assume that this flow is confined in a shell from @xmath15 to the surface @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , i.e , primarily in the liquid part of the crust . near the equator , the flow originating from the two polar regions would meet , turn around and sink under the surface .",
    "we expect a pole - ward counter - flow in a region immediately below @xmath18 .",
    "eventually this material settles radially on the core .",
    "so we expect @xmath14 to become radially inward at some radius @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the pole - ward counter - flow as well as the radially inward flow would take place mainly in the solid crystalline region .",
    "we have a source of new material in the polar cap region .",
    "apart from that , we must have .",
    "( ) = 0 everywhere else .",
    "we now write down a velocity field which has all these characteristics . in the top layer @xmath21 of equator - ward flow ,",
    "we take v_r = k_1 e^- ^2 [ vr1 ] v _ = k_1 ( ) ( 1 - e^-^2 ) .",
    "[ vth1 ] in the next lower layer @xmath22 where we expect the flow to turn around , we take v_r & = & k_2 e^-^2   + & & + & - & + & & k_2 [ vr2 ] v _ & = & ( r + - r_b - r_m ) + & & .",
    "[ vth2 ] finally , when @xmath23 , we take the velocity to be radially inward ( characteristic of the radial compression in the deeper layers ) : v_r = - [ vr3 ] v _ = 0 .",
    "[ vth3 ] it is evident from the context that the rate of accretion is related to these coefficients by the relation @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be related from the fact that @xmath28 has to be continuous across @xmath15 and @xmath19 . from the continuity of @xmath28 at @xmath15 ,",
    "we obtain & & k_1 + & & = k_2 , whereas the continuity of @xmath28 at @xmath19 gives = .",
    "we have specified @xmath29 in such a fashion that it is equator - ward in the upper layer @xmath30 and pole - ward in the lower layer @xmath31 , falling to zero both at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath32 everywhere below @xmath15 . if we choose the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in such a fashion that the factors @xmath35 and @xmath36 have values different from unity in the non - overlapping regions around the equator and the pole respectively , then the divergence in the uppermost layer above @xmath15 turns out to be : .",
    "( ) = k_1 ( 1 - ) e^- ^2 .",
    "we thus have a source of material only in the region around the pole in the upper layer .",
    "our expression for the velocity field given by ( [ vr1])([vth3 ] ) may seem somewhat complicated to the reader .",
    "but this is the simplest velocity field satisfying all the necessary characteristics that we have been able to write down .",
    "+    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows how @xmath37 , given by eqs.([vr1])([vth3 ] ) , looks like . in all our discussions",
    ", we shall assume the radius @xmath38 of the neutron star to be the unit of length .",
    "[ fig1 ] has been generated by taking @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "if we assume the density to be constant , then the amplitude of the equator - ward flow in the top layer and the amplitude of the pole - ward counter - flow in the layer underneath it are of comparable magnitude .",
    "but in the crustal layers of a neutron star , the density varies by 8 orders of magnitude , which is difficult for a numerical code to handle .",
    "therefore , to study the effect of density stratification , we allow the density to vary by 2 orders .",
    "this is done by modeling the density variation with the radius as ( r ) = 1.01 - e^-(r_s - r ) , [ eq_rho ] with @xmath43 . a plot of this variation of density with radius is shown in fig .",
    "this figure also shows the variation of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45 at the mid - latitude ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the unit of velocity is set by equating @xmath27 appearing in eq.([vr3 ] ) to unity .",
    "this , along with the unit of length defined by the radius of the neutron star , fixes the unit of time in our problem .",
    "so , the unit of time is essentially the convective time scale from eq.([eq_dadt ] ) , given by _",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the equator - ward flow velocity near the surface is about 100.0 .",
    "the time scale for the flow ( i.e.  the time taken by this flow to traverse the radius of the neutron star ) is about 0.01 unit of time .",
    "the pole - ward counter - flow under the top layer has an amplitude of about @xmath47 , giving a time scale of about 0.5 .",
    "this flow is weaker by a factor of about 100 compared to the flow near the surface because the density in this deeper layer is enhanced by a factor of 100 with respect to the density at the surface .",
    "+    to obtain the evolution of the magnetic field with time , we need to solve eq.([eq_dadt ] ) with the velocity field defined by eq.([vr1])-([vth3 ] ) .",
    "we integrate eq.([eq_dadt ] ) numerically in the region @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where the interior boundary of integration @xmath50 is taken some distance below @xmath51 . the following boundary conditions are satisfied . the field lines from the two hemispheres",
    "should match smoothly at the equator , which requires = 0 , = /2 . to avoid a singularity at the pole , we need to have a = 0 , = 0 .",
    "now , at the upper boundary @xmath16 , we allow the magnetic field to smoothly match a potential field outside ( dikpati & choudhuri 1994 ) , which satisfies the free space laplace equation ( ^2 - ) a = 0 . its solution has the general form a(r r_s , , t ) = _ n p^l_n ( ) , which , to match the boundary condition at @xmath52 mentioned above , picks up only the odd @xmath53 terms .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 are obtained from the surface values of @xmath11 by the following relation a_n(t ) = ^n+1 ^/2_0 a(r_s,,t ) p^l_n ( ) d. the derivative of @xmath11 at the surface is |_r = r_s = - _ n ( n+1 ) p^l_n ( ) . hence , the top boundary condition is that our solution has to match ( 21 ) at @xmath16 , with @xmath55 being given by ( 20 ) .",
    "finally , at the lower boundary @xmath56 , we allow the magnetic field to be carried freely downward by the radially inward velocity field there .",
    "how this is implemented in the numerical scheme is pointed out in the appendix .",
    "our code is developed by using the code of dikpati & choudhuri ( 1994 ) developed in the context of solar mhd as a template .",
    "we summarize the salient features of the numerical schemes in the appendix of the present paper .",
    "so far , the evolution of a magnetic field due to a flow like what we are considering has not been studied before . therefore , to begin with , we present a general study of the problem , to gain an understanding of it , before we consider applications to the neutron star . in a neutron star ,",
    "the velocity field remains confined to the uppermost layer , which is rather thin compared to the size of the star ( the equator - ward flow takes place in a layer of 100 m , which is about 1% of the neutron star radius ) .",
    "solving the equations numerically in such a thin layer involves dealing with special numerical instabilities . nor is it easy to plot the resulting magnetic field configurations without making some transformations to blow up the thin region where all action takes place .",
    "we , therefore , first study the basic physics of the problem by taking the velocity field confined to a reasonably thick layer .",
    "most of the calculations presented in this section uses the velocity field shown in fig .",
    "we shall see that it is possible to draw important conclusions which are independent of the thickness of the flow region .",
    "the implications of our calculations for an accreting neutron star will be discussed in the next section .",
    "there is no clear consensus regarding the question as to whether the magnetic field of a typical neutron star penetrates through the core or whether it is confined to the crust .",
    "we shall first present results taking the initial magnetic field to be in the form of a dipolar potential field centred at the centre of the star and pervading the entire star .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the field lines for such a potential field , given by a = ; [ eq_dip ] which we assume to be the initial configuration of the field .",
    "we have already mentioned that the magnetic fields in the uppermost molten layers just below the surface would be subject to magnetic buoyancy .",
    "let us first present some calculations without including magnetic buoyancy .",
    "now , to calculate the evolution of the field in time , we also need to specify the value of @xmath57 . figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the magnetic field configuration after time 0.1 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively ( in units in which @xmath38 and @xmath27 are taken as unity and we have also suppressed the physical dimensions of @xmath57 here ) . when @xmath57 has the smaller value @xmath60 , the magnetic field is nearly frozen in the plasma and gets buried underneath the layer of accreted material , as seen in fig .",
    "however , if @xmath57 has the larger value of 1 , then the field emerges out to the surface due to ohmic diffusion and it is no longer possible for the accreting material to bury the magnetic field very effectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath61 at a point just below the surface at the mid - latitude is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that @xmath61 decreases more rapidly if the diffusivity is low . at the first sight , this may appear counter - intuitive .",
    "we would normally expect a lower diffusivity to make a magnetic field decay less rapidly .",
    "here the situation is reversed because the flow of accreting material is able to bury the magnetic field better if @xmath57 is lower and the magnetic field is frozen in the material more effectively . from a plot like fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , one can easily estimate the time  in which the magnetic field near the surface falls to half of its initial value .",
    "figure  7 shows how  varies with @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath57 is large , the flow can not carry the magnetic field with it and  is large . on the other hand , a smaller @xmath57 makes the magnetic field frozen in the plasma and the field can be carried away in the time scale of the flow .",
    "hence , for smaller values of @xmath57 ,  reaches an asymptotic value which is essentially the time scale of flow in the upper thin layer .",
    "the fact that  reaches an asymptotic value even before the value of @xmath57 is reduced to @xmath60 is of some significance .",
    "our code becomes numerically unstable if we make @xmath57 an order smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "on the basis of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we expect that the behaviour of the system should not change on lowering the value of @xmath57 below @xmath60 , even though we are unable to run our code for such values .      in the uppermost layers of a neutron star where matter is in a molten state ,",
    "magnetic buoyancy would make the magnetic field rise against gravity .",
    "it has been shown in the context of the solar convection zone that , when rotation is important , the magnetic field rises parallel to the rotation axis rather than radially outward ( choudhuri & gilman 1987 , choudhuri 1989 ) . in a rapidly spinning neutron star",
    ", the magnetic field may tend to rise parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "but , to simplify the problem , we are assuming that the magnetic field rises radially .",
    "the results of the present calculation are not expected to change much if we make the rise parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "+    we capture the effect of magnetic buoyancy by superimposing on our velocity field given by eq.([vr1]-[vth3 ] ) a radial velocity in the uppermost layer .",
    "hence , in the top layer @xmath62 , we add a velocity given by v_r = v_mb ( r - r_m ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 determines the strength of magnetic buoyancy .",
    "it should be mentioned here that this is just a simplified way of modeling the effect of magnetic buoyancy . in reality , the upward velocity due to buoyancy must be proportional to the square of the field strength at any point ( cumming , zweibel & bildsten 2001 ) . since , we are only interested in obtaining the gross features of the possible screening effect , here we work with the above mentioned model velocity instead of going into further details . we have found that our results remain virtually unaltered on taking @xmath63 equal to 50.0 or 100.0 .",
    "this means that the effect of magnetic buoyancy saturates when @xmath64 and things do not change any more on increasing @xmath63 .",
    "we now present calculations with @xmath64 .",
    "we again begin with the initial configuration given by eq.([eq_dip ] ) and shown in fig .",
    "now , fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the field at @xmath65 for @xmath59 .",
    "the only difference between fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] is that fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] is obtained with magnetic buoyancy included .",
    "on comparing the two figures , we find that magnetic buoyancy in the uppermost layer has the effect of making magnetic field lines radial there . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have seen clearly that the equator - ward flow completely screens the magnetic field from the uppermost surface layer .",
    "this has not happened in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] where magnetic buoyancy has made the magnetic field emerge through the uppermost layer . to show how the magnetic field will keep evolving from the configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show the magnetic configuration at a later time 0.5 in fig .",
    "it is clear from figures  [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] that the slow flow in the deeper layers carries the magnetic field deeper down as well as to higher latitudes from the equatorial region .",
    "how the magnetic field @xmath61 at mid - latitude near the surface changes with time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . for the sake of comparison , in this figure",
    "we again show the evolution of @xmath61 without magnetic buoyancy for @xmath59 ( which was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] also ) .",
    "although the magnetic field in the case with buoyancy has not been screened by the equator - ward flow in the upper layer , as in the case without buoyancy , we still find that @xmath61 keeps decreasing even in the case with buoyancy .",
    "the time in which @xmath61 decreases appreciably is of the order 0.1 .",
    "we have already estimated in  2 that the time scale for the slow flow in the interior is 0.5 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the decrease in @xmath61 near the surface is caused by the magnetic field being carried to deeper layers by the slow flow in the interior .",
    "even though magnetic buoyancy is now allowing the magnetic field to emerge through the top layer and it is not possible for the equator - ward flow in that layer to screen the magnetic field , we conclude that the magnetic field still gets screened from the outside by the effect of the slow interior flow which pushes the magnetic field deeper down . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic field gets buried in the time scale of the slow interior flow when magnetic buoyancy is taken into account ( instead of getting buried in the time scale of the faster flow of the top layer as in the case when buoyancy is not included ) .",
    "+    letting the field evolve in time for different values of @xmath57 , we can find  for the different values when magnetic buoyancy is included .",

    "[ fig7 ] basically corresponds to the time scale of the equator - ward flow in the top layer , whereas the asymptotic value in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] corresponds to the time scale of the slower flow in the interior .",
    "we now show what happens if the magnetic field is confined to the crust .",
    "for this purpose , we begin with the magnetic configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "then figures  [ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] respectively show the field configurations at @xmath66 without and with magnetic buoyancy ( using @xmath59 ) .",
    "it is again found that the flow of accreted material in the top layer quickly screens the magnetic field in the absence of magnetic buoyancy , whereas on inclusion of magnetic buoyancy we find that the field is able to emerge through the top layer .",
    "the interior flow carries the magnetic field slowly to deeper layers and to higher latitudes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the magnetic field eventually tends to take up configurations which do not look very different from the configurations which arise if we begin with an initial magnetic field passing through the core ( compare figures  [ fig13][fig14 ] with figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we thus expect the results to be qualitatively similar even if we start from quite different initial configurations .",
    "+    to see the effect of the velocity field very clearly , we also study what happens if the velocity field is switched off and the magnetic field is allowed to decay due to diffusion alone .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows what the magnetic field starting from the initial configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] would look at @xmath67 if the velocity field is switched off . since diffusion is a slower process for the values of parameters we are using , note that we have evolved the magnetic field for a longer interval compared to what was done in the other figures .",
    "we see that the magnetic field has spread outside the region where it was initially confined .",
    "we point out that such a study of pure diffusion would not be possible with the initial potential field passing through the core ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) that we considered in the earlier subsections .",
    "our bottom boundary condition specified in the appendix is such that @xmath11 would not change at the bottom if the velocity field were switched off .",
    "hence , if we start from the initial potential field ( given by eq.([eq_dip ] ) ) and allow it to evolve under diffusion alone , it is easy to see that the field remains invariant .",

    "if there were no magnetic buoyancy , then the magnetic field would have been screened in a very short time scale arising from the flow of accreted material in the top layer . on account of magnetic buoyancy ,",
    "we obtain an intermediate time scale between these two , which is essentially the time scale of the slow interior flow .",
    "we now argue that our general conclusions do not change on reducing the thickness of the layer in which the flow takes place .",
    "we point out in the next section that we expect @xmath68 in a neutron star ( we have been taking @xmath39 in the above exploratory calculations ) .",
    "we find that our code does not retain numerical stability if @xmath69 is increased to 0.99 .",
    "however , we have been able to obtain results by increasing the value of @xmath69 up to 0.95 and find that our general conclusions inferred in the earlier subsections do not change .",
    "we now present our results obtained by taking @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the initial field configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "we also change the value of @xmath72 in eq.([eq_rho ] ) to 20 to simulate a very sharp drop in the density profile .",
    "+ we find that in absence and in presence of magnetic buoyancy the field configuration gets modified to the ones seen in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] respectively .",
    "it is evident that the generic nature of field evolution is very much the same as that seen in the previous subsection . in the earlier case , however , magnetic buoyancy saturated at @xmath73 and the nature of field evolution did not change on increasing @xmath63 beyond . in the present case ,",
    "the similar effect is seen around @xmath74 .",
    "this difference is not difficult to understand if we keep in mind that @xmath63 has to be multiplied by @xmath75 to get the buoyant rise speed , as seen in ( 23 ) . whereas the maximum value of @xmath75 was 0.25 for the calculations in the previous subsections , here",
    "its maximum value is 0.05 . to compensate for this , we need to take a larger @xmath63 to get buoyant rise speeds of similar magnitude .",
    "+ for comparison , we also show the case of pure diffusion in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] . to compare the time scales of evolution , in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] we have plotted the decay of the surface field ( near mid - latitude ) for the three cases - a ) without magnetic buoyancy , b ) with magnetic buoyancy and c ) for pure diffusion . conforming to our expectation ( which has already been seen in the previous sub - section ) ,",
    "the time scales of field decay without buoyancy , with buoyancy and that of pure diffusion arrange themselves in an increasing order .",
    "therefore , in conclusion we can say that all the characteristic features of our calculation are also borne out by confining the physics to a very narrow layer near the surface .",
    "this vindicates the attempt of generalizing our results to the case of neutron stars ( which we describe in some detail in the next section ) , even though the exact calculations could not be performed by our numerical code .",
    "in a real neutron star , the equator - ward flow must be confined to a very narrow layer near the surface within which density varies by several orders of magnitude .",
    "our numerical code is unable to handle such a severe density contrast .",
    "however , from the results presented in the previous section , the following important parameter - independent conclusions emerge : iif the flow time scale is shorter than the diffusion time scale , then it is possible for the flow to carry the magnetic field with it and eventually bury the field under the surface . iin the absence of magnetic buoyancy , the magnetic field gets buried in the time scale of the equator - ward flow in the top layer .",
    "iwhen magnetic buoyancy is taken into account , the magnetic field is buried in the time scale of the much slower counter - flow under the top layer .",
    "these results seem fairly robust and we expect them to be valid in the case of neutron stars too .",
    "therefore , we are able to make some inferences about the neutron stars on the basis of our estimates of the time scale of diffusion , the time scale of equator - ward flow of accreted matter and the time scale of very slow motion of the solid material under the top layer .",
    "we now attempt to estimate these various time scales .",
    "+ the magnetic field of the isolated neutron stars is typically @xmath76  g , which makes the magnetic pressure at the polar cap @xmath77  dyne @xmath78 . as material starts collecting in the polar regions , excess pressure builds up , and when this excess pressure becomes @xmath79 of the magnetic pressure , the accumulated material flows sidewise overcoming the magnetic stresses ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) . from the equation of state of the neutron star material ,",
    "we find that the density at which the pressure becomes @xmath80  dyne @xmath78 is @xmath81 . from the density profile of a 1.4  neutron star , assuming a moderately stiff equation of state , we find that @xmath82 corresponds to a depth of 100 m below the surface , where @xmath45 has the approximate value @xmath83 ( @xmath38 is radius of the star , which turns out to be about 10 km ) .",
    "( for a discussion on the equation of state used here and the calculation of the density profile of a 1.4  neutron star , see konar 1997 ) .",
    "we expect that the excess pressure of accreting material at the poles will induce equator - ward flow up to this depth of 100 m. + let us assume that the rate of material accretion in the polar region is .",
    "if the polar cap has a circumference of @xmath84 and there is an outflow across this circumference with velocity @xmath85 and up to depth @xmath86 , then we must have : 2 l h v .",
    "the eddington accretion rate for a neutron star is @xmath87",
    "yr@xmath7 , i.e.  about @xmath88 gm s@xmath7 in cgs units . taking @xmath89 km , @xmath90 m , @xmath91 gm @xmath92 , we find the velocity of outflow to be : v 10 ^ -1 ^-1 . combining this velocity with a length of 10 km ( i.e. the typical radius of a neutron star ) , we get a time scale of about 1 year for the equator - ward flow of accreted matter . +",
    "we now estimate the velocity of the slow counter - flow of solid material under the surface . assuming a density increase of 100",
    ", we found that the velocity of counter - flow in the inner layers is about 100 times less than the velocity of equator - ward flow in the top layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and discussions in the text about it ) .",
    "we have estimated the density in the layer of equator - ward flow to be about @xmath93 gm @xmath92 , whereas the density some distance below the surface is @xmath94 .",
    "an increase of density by a factor of @xmath0 would lead to a decrease of velocity by the same factor .",
    "although geometrical factors such as the radial depth of the region across which the counter - flow takes place would have some role , here we are interested only in rough orders of magnitude . dividing the velocity at the surface by this factor of @xmath0",
    ", we get a velocity of about @xmath95  cm s@xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to a time scale of @xmath8 years .",
    "we can conclude that the magnetic field of the accreting neutron star would get screened in 1 year in the absence of magnetic buoyancy and in about @xmath0 years if magnetic buoyancy is important , provided the diffusion time scale is larger than these time scales and the magnetic field can be assumed as nearly frozen in the material .",
    "+ the electrical conductivity @xmath9 in the interior of an accretion heated neutron star is @xmath96 s@xmath7 so that @xmath97 @xmath98 s@xmath7 . using a length scale of about 1 km , we obtain a diffusion time scale @xmath99  s or @xmath100 years .",
    "it is true that the electrical conductivity of the crust can be as low as @xmath101 in the surface layers and the diffusive time scale calculated on the basis of that will be smaller by several orders .",
    "however , if magnetic buoyancy is dominant in the outer layers , the magnetic field comes out to the surface in any case and we need not bother about the role of ohmic diffusion in the crust in making the magnetic field emerge through the accreted matter .",
    "the important point to note here is that the diffusion time scale in the interior is much larger than the estimated time scale of @xmath0 years of the slow flow in the interior .",
    "we , therefore , expect that the slow displacement of the solid material in the interior to be able to carry the magnetic field and bury it in the time scale of @xmath0 years . it should be mentioned here that this time scale happens to be of the similar order as the mass accretion time scale of most massive x - ray binaries .",
    "+ let us now make a few comments on magnetic buoyancy .",
    "it is well known that magnetic buoyancy is particularly destabilizing in a region of super - adiabatic gradient , whereas its effect can be reduced in a region of sub - adiabatic gradient ( parker 1979 , moreno - insertis 1983 ) . although the top layer of the neutron star is expected to be sub - adiabatic , we believe that magnetic buoyancy will still be important there . in a sub - adiabatic region , a magnetic flux tube continues to rise as it exchanges heat with the surrounding medium and comes to thermal equilibrium ( parker 1979 ,  8.8 ) . the very high thermal conductivity in the crust of the neutron star should keep magnetic buoyancy going even in a sub - adiabatic environment .",
    "so it is unlikely that the magnetic field of the neutron star can get screened in the time scale of 1 year of the flow of accreting matter on the surface .",
    "even if magnetic buoyancy were suppressed for some unknown reason , the much shorter ohmic diffusion time in the crust would make the magnetic field emerge out of the accreted matter ( cumming , zweibel & bildsten 2001 ) .",
    "however , it appears that the slow motion of the solid material in the interior of the neutron star may carry the magnetic field with it and eventually bury the magnetic field in its time scale of @xmath0 years .",
    "it is true that we have not been able to present detailed calculations appropriate for the neutron star and some of our arguments are heuristic .",
    "however , we humbly submit that this proposal is worth considering .",
    "in the past there has existed a controversy regarding the possible mechanism of screening of the magnetic field of the neutron star by the accreting matter .",
    "we have tried to address the question with a 2-d simulation .",
    "although we could run our code only for thicknesses of flow layers much more than what they would be in a realistic situation , we have arrived at a few generic results which seem robust and independent of the thickness of flow layer .",
    "so we believe that these results can be extrapolated to neutron stars .",
    "basically we find that the magnetic field would get screened in the short time scale of the flow of accreting material in the top layer if magnetic buoyancy is neglected , whereas on inclusion of magnetic buoyancy the screening takes place in the somewhat longer time scale of the slow interior flows .",
    "since magnetic buoyancy is expected to be important for neutron stars , we believe that the second time scale of interior flows will be the appropriate time scale for screening the magnetic field of neutron stars .",
    "we have estimated this time scale to be of order @xmath0 years .",
    "+ it is remarkable that this is comparable to the time scale of accretion in massive x - ray binaries .",
    "it must be an extraordinary coincidence that these two time scales arising out of completely different considerations turn out to be fairly close .",
    "this coincidence has important implications .",
    "if the time scale for screening was much larger than the time scale for accretion , then the magnetic field could not be screened much during the accretion phase . on the other hand ,",
    "if the screening time scale happened to be much shorter than accretion time scale , then the magnetic field might have been screened so well that there would be virtually no magnetic field seen from outside .",
    "observationally we find that the magnetic fields of binary / millisecond pulsars are considerably weaker compared to magnetic fields of normal pulsars , but are not altogether negligible .",
    "can we take this as an observational confirmation that the screening time scale should be of the similar order as the accretion time scale ?",
    "+ although considerations of neutron stars motivated us to undertake these calculations , we point out that what we have studied is the basic physics of magnetic field evolution in a situation of polar accretion .",
    "our results should apply to other situations such as accretion onto white dwarfs . in the case of neutron stars",
    ", we have observations which seem to indicate that accreting matter may screen the magnetic field .",
    "we do not have observations to tell us what happens to magnetic fields in other stellar systems as a result of mass accretion .",
    "but the basic physics must be the same .",
    "+ our model is based on certain assumptions . we have assumed a specific form of the velocity field , which essentially implies that the accreting matter primarily sinks near the equator where flows from the two different hemispheres meet and the matter in the underlying layers at the equator is thereby pushed downward as well as to higher latitudes in the form of a counter - flow .",
    "the other crucial assumption is that the dense matter in the lower layers is displaced very slowly while remaining solid and hence the magnetic field remains embedded in the solid matter of interior flow regions where magnetic buoyancy is suppressed .",
    "once we make these assumptions , our results follow from fairly straightforward calculations .",
    "are our assumptions justified ?",
    "we are not aware of any arguments that can be advanced against these assumptions and they do appear reasonable to us . to substantiate these assumptions fully , one will require some sophisticated fluid mechanics and sophisticated condensed matter physics of very dense material .",
    "we hope that researchers more conversant in these subjects than us will look into these questions in future .",
    "+ this being the first calculation of this type , we have restricted ourselves to a simple exploratory model .",
    "we could not run our code reducing the thickness of the upper layer to realistic values .",
    "researchers more competent in handling numerical instabilities should be able to do better than us .",
    "also , we have made the simplifying assumption that our velocity field remains independent of time .",
    "as magnetic field is pushed away , the polar cap widens and the accretion should take place over a broader region around the pole .",
    "we do not expect this to change our basic results , which seem quite robust .",
    "however , one will have to use a time - varying velocity field to build more realistic models of diamagnetic screening .",
    "all our calculations are based on a velocity field for which we could write down a convenient analytical expression .",
    "since we can only make intelligent guesses as to what the velocity field may be like at the surface of the neutron star , it would be worthwhile to investigate other forms of the velocity field and to ascertain whether certain velocity fields are more efficient in diamagnetic screening than others .",
    "we are right now in in the process of studying the screening of the magnetic field by other types of velocity fields , especially by velocity fields which change with time as the polar cap widens .",
    "we hope to present our results in a future paper ( konar & choudhuri , in preparation ) .",
    "we end with the comment that our first exploratory study appears promising and the scenario presented by us should be investigated further .",
    "we thank dipankar bhattacharya for suggesting this problem , and partha sarathi joarder and dibyendu nandy for help with the numerical code .",
    "we are indebted to mousumi dikpati , whose code developed in the context of solar mhd provided the template for the development of the code used in the present calculations .",
    "a few subroutines of the older code are used in our programme .",
