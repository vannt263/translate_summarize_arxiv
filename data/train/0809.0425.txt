    "a last important aspect regarded to the diffractive process is the rapidity gaps present in the final state due to the vacuum quantum numbers of the exchanged particle : the pomeron .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] for two different mass ranges , and taking predictions for tevatron and lhc energies . in the result for lhc",
    ", the event rate has a different shape in comparison to the results for tevatron in virtue of the energy scale .",
    "the momentum fraction in tevatron does not reach the necessary value @xmath116 to permit one to consider the coupling of a gluon ladder to the proton . at most ,",
    "the momentum fraction in tevatron achieves @xmath117 0.05 , when considering the lower bound of the higgs mass ( 114.4 gev @xcite ) , which is not enough to employ the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "this is an important result and reveals the limitations of this approach .",
    "otherwise , this kind of discrepancy is not observed in lhc , since the necessary value of momentum fraction can be easily achieved .",
    "another important feature observed in lhc is the difference between the lo and nlo distributions . in this energy scale , the contributions from the recombination effects take place and reveal its importance to correctly predict the cross sections . having a smaller energy compared to lhc , the tevatron do not show the same evidence .",
    "further information about the higgs production and better knowledge on the recombination effects in qcd should be obtained in the future data from lhc . as made before in the lhc predictions ,",
    "the mass range is extended in order to observe the role of the sudakov form factors , showing the same behavior for all parametrizations .",
    "an analysis must be done to verify the sensitivity of the results to the cut in the momentum integration , for that the event rate is calculated for some values of the cut , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "there is a significative difference between the results of tevatron and lhc , where the contributions to the event rate have very distinct behaviors as the cut value varies .",
    "this comparison shows that there is a smaller contribution to the event rate in lhc for higher cut values , being almost two times smaller if one takes @xmath118 , instead of @xmath119 . on the other hand ,",
    "its contribution in tevatron is quite distinct than the lhc results . analysing it in the intermediary mass range",
    ", there is a non - uniform behavior between the results of tevatron , where , roughly speaking , the results with the extreme values have a leading contribution for the event rate .",
    "however , the results obtained in the extended mass range show that for higher values of the higgs mass the contribution is exactly contrary than those obtained for lhc , differing in four times the results between the extreme values .",
    "this behavior in the results for tevatron shows the consequence of taking a higher value to the momentum fraction ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "therefore , analysing the results for these two energy scales , the sensitivity is as was expected , showing a small variation for different cut values , e.g. , for a higgs mass of 140 gev , these results are three times less sensitive than the kmr ones . in the results for lhc , one can estimate an upper limit for the momentum cut , such that the contributions to the event rate can be neglected from this cut value : the result for @xmath121 = 30 gev@xmath85 is almost zero in all range .",
    "this sensitivity can be explained by the form of the differential cross section obtained from this approach if compared with the result of the durham group , where there is a higher sensitivity . despite of an additional distribution function , in the photoproduction",
    "approach the event rate has a dependence on @xmath122 and a function depending on @xmath79 and @xmath123 .    to observe the dependence of the event rate on the center - of - mass energy ,",
    "the results are obtained in function of the e@xmath124 for distinct higgs masses and observing the behavior with the distribution functions .",
    "this process is analysed for three values of the higgs boson mass , as shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the growth of the event rate with e@xmath125 has a parabolic shape up to e@xmath124 = 2.0 tev ( tevatron region ) and a linear behavior for higher energies .",
    "as explained in this section , this parabolic shape occurs due to the values of @xmath126 probed in this energy region , showing approximately the same result for any chosen value of the higgs boson mass . in the upper graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , one observes the event rate in a lower range of energy . as the higgs mass varies , the results show a non - uniform behavior if compared to the one observed in the high - energy region : the contribution from @xmath127 = 120 gev is smaller than the other ones , and grows as the energy increases , assuming a leading contribution in the very - high - energy limit .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath126-variable on the center - of - mass energy is the reason to the presence of this transition region .",
    "morevoer , the sudakov form factors determine the lower contribution to the production of a heavier higgs boson .",
    "the same behavior occurs in the results using distinct parametrizations , as shown in the upper - right graph in fig .",
    "a similar contribution arises among the curves in the left - upper and right - upper graphs , although very distinct absolute values of the event rate .",
    "an important aspect observed in the lower - right graph is the same difference shown between mrst lo and nlo distribution functions , as seen in all energy range .",
    "the cteq6 parametrization has a transition behavior : this is similar to mrst2001 up to e@xmath124 = 8.0 tev , and then grows to achieve mrst2004 at very - high energy .",
    "the contribution to the higgs production for distinct virtualities shows a dependence upon the photon energy . observing the comparison with the results of @xcite ,",
    "the photoproduction results have a higher contribution in the intermediary range as well as in the extended one . however , when the full analysis in peripheral collisions is taken into account , including the photon distribution in the proton , this difference between the approaches is expected to be modified , in order to the photoproduction results achieve the same shape of those of the durham group , although with a higher contribution in the intermediary range .",
    "otherwise , the study of this process in nucleus - nucleus collisions will show its dependence on the photon energy and on the photon number , features that should be drastically modified if compared to the @xmath0 case .",
    "as one can see , the results obtained taking the photon virtuality on the order of q@xmath128 10@xmath84 gev@xmath85 gives an event rate going to infinity , such that the real - photon limit is reached . thus , even considering an overestimated prediction to the higgs production at small virtualities , the results at q@xmath85 = 1.0 gev@xmath85 reach values of a few femtobarns , which agree with other predictions for diffractive higgs production at lhc @xcite .",
    "waiting the data coming from cms and atlas experiments at lhc , these results will be confronted to the data in order to determine the best options for higgs photoproduction in peripheral collisions .",
    "one of the main aspects to be observed is to get suitable data to specify the restrictions to the virtuality range .",
    "a new way to produce the higgs boson was studied in peripheral collisions , calculating perturbatively the event rate for diffractive production through dpe .",
    "previously , some studies had been done exploring the photoproduction process , however none of them adopting the dpe as the interaction between the colliding particles .",
    "the numerical results obtained from the photoproduction approach predicts a reasonable event rate for higgs production at lhc if compared to previous estimates for the higgs production . the event rate was obtained for the @xmath5 interaction with a dependence on @xmath122 , unlike to the result carried out in @xcite . to effectively compare the results presented in this work with those of the durham group , a distribution function for the photons in the proton should be introduced , and then the results to the peripheral @xmath0 collisions will be computed .",
    "therefore , the results show the possibility to produce the higgs boson through peripheral collisions at lhc with an event rate expected to be big enough to detect this boson .",
