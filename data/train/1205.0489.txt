    "they are separated by buffer layers comprising , for example , rare earth oxides in the so - called 1111 systems , such as those based on lafeaso , or alkaline earths in the so - called 122 systems , such as those based on bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 . like the cuprate superconductors ,",

    "i.e. _ , along the direction of the nearest - neighbor iron - iron bonds [ 12 ] .",
    "all the fermi surface pockets have similar radii in the undoped compounds , making their electronic structure particularly susceptible to magnetic instabilities resulting from a nesting of the disconnected hole and electron fermi surfaces [ 13 ] . since the nesting wavevector corresponds to the antiferromagnetic wavevector observed by neutron diffraction [ 14 - 16 ] , it is plausible that the magnetism can be explained by a purely itinerant model of spin density waves , and _ ab initio _ density functional theory does indeed predict the correct magnetic structure [ 17 ] , although there is an ongoing debate about the strength of electron correlations [ 18,19 ] .",
    "the magnetic structure breaks the tetragonal symmetry with an in - plane wavevector of either ( 0,@xmath20 ) or ( @xmath20,0 ) in the unfolded brillouin zone with one iron atom per unit cell . with a finite magnetoelastic coupling",
    ", this would induce an orthorhombic structural transition , which is usually observed to occur at the same temperature as magnetic order in the parent compounds [ 20,21 ] .",

    "a variety of scenarios are possible in ginzburg - landau treatments of the magnetoelastic coupling [ 22,23 ] .",

    "this is inconsistent with our previously reported neutron diffraction data , which shows unambiguously that they are coincident and first - order for all @xmath11 before they are both suppressed at @xmath21 [ 6 ] .",
    "unusually , the two order parameters , magnetic and structural , are proportional to each other , apparently indicating a biquadratic coupling that is usually only observed at a tetracritical point [ 26,27 ] , not over an extended range of compositions .",
    "possible explanations for this observation will be discussed in the conclusions .",
    "superconductivity emerges before the complete suppression of the antiferromagnetic / orthorhombic ( af / o ) phase and coexists at low - doping levels .",
    "the nature of the competition between af / o order and superconductivity is a central question in understanding iron - based superconductivity [ 28,29 ] .",
    "there were earlier reports based on local probes that , in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , the coexistence region is characterized by a mesoscopic phase separation into af / o and superconducting droplets [ 30,31 ] , but our previously reported diffraction data are only consistent with a microscopic phase coexistence [ 6 ] , a conclusion since supported by muon spin rotation ( @xmath22sr ) experiments [ 32 ] , suggesting that the earlier reports may be due to compositional fluctuations within the samples .",

    "[ fig1 ] ]    one of the main reasons for studying ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 is that superconductivity extends up to much higher hole - doping levels , with 0.5 holes / fe atom , than in the electron - doped superconductors produced by transition metal substitutions . in the case of bafe@xmath17co@xmath16as@xmath2 ,",

    "this electron - hole asymmetry in the phase diagram has been attributed to an enhanced fermi surface nesting in the hole - doped compounds , consistent with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data and band structure calculations [ 33 ] .",
    "this explanation is also supported by the evolution of resonant spin excitations , which become incommensurate due to the mismatch in hole and electron fermi surface volumes when @xmath12 starts to fall [ 34 ] .",
    "on the other hand , there is also a strong correlation between @xmath12 and internal structural parameters such as the fe - as - fe bond angles [ 35,36 ] .",
    "these are known to have an influence on the band structure and the degree of moment localization , but their role in optimizing superconductivity and the implications for the gap symmetry is a matter of debate [ 37,38 ] .",

    "all members of the ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 series crystallize in a tetragonal structure with the space group symmetry of @xmath6 ( fig .",

    "superconducting samples at higher doping have a maximum @xmath12 of 38k and remain tetragonal at all measured temperatures down to 1.7k . however , there are significant discrepancies in the published reports concerning the critical dopant concentrations defining the onset of superconductivity and the suppression of the af / o phase , with the latter varying from @xmath24 [ 36 ] to @xmath25 [ 39 ] .",
    "as already mentioned , there have also been disagreements about the nature of the competition between the three ordered phases at low doping .",
    "we believe that these discrepancies are due to uncertainties in the actual composition of the synthesized samples , since it is well - known that potassium is particularly volatile . controlling the inhomogeneity to within acceptable limits in order to improve the accuracy of the various phase boundaries has been a key goal of this work and we estimate that we have been able to make samples in which @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig12 ] ]    phenomenological theory of magnetoelastic coupling predicts the possibility of simultaneous first - order transitions that are driven by a linear - quadratic term in the ginzburg - landau expansion [ 22,23 ] ( see also ref . [ 47 ] ) .",

    "if the magnetic transition were to occur at higher temperature than the structural transition ( in the absence of any competition ) , the magnetic order would drive the structural order in a simultaneous first - order transition .",

    "there is a report of a split transition in ba@xmath0k@xmath16fe@xmath2as@xmath2 based on nuclear magnetic resonance results [ 25 ] , but this is a local probe , which can not necessarily identify compositional fluctuations .",
    "as we have already discussed , the neutron measurements , which represent true averages over the bulk , are quite unambiguous that the two transitions are simultaneous , although there could be some rounding of the transitions at higher doping from small compositional fluctuations .",

    "there are a number of possible reasons for this .",
    "the most intriguing and exotic idea is that the af / o order parameters are both secondary to another order parameter and directly driven by it .",

    "a subtle , but ultimately more conventional explanation , is that the coupling is linear - quadratic after all , but the proximity to a first - order transition produces a temperature dependence that is approximately equivalent to biquadratic coupling to first order [ 29 ] .",

    "support for this explanation is provided by fig .",

    "the strong coupling between af / o order parameters persists into the regime of phase coexistence with superconductivity .",
    "we have already argued that ba@xmath0k@xmath16fe@xmath2as@xmath2 is characterized by microscopic phase coexistence because mesoscopic phase separation would result in a significant decrease in the volume fraction of the af / o phase below @xmath12 .",
    "the consensus in favor of microscopic phase coexistence has existed for some time in the electron - doped superconductors , such as bafe@xmath17co@xmath16as@xmath2 [ 24 ] , where the phase boundary below @xmath12 to a non - magnetic , purely superconducting region has also been identified .",
    "theoretically , this behavior is consistent with unconventional @xmath68 pairing of the cooper pairs suggesting that itinerant long range magnetism and superconductivity may coexist and compete for the same electrons [ 45 ] .",

    ". both the strength of magnetic interactions and superconductivity , at least in an itinerant model , depend on the same lindhard function [ 54 ] , the former on the peak in the susceptibility at the magnetic wavevector , and the latter on an integral over the fermi surfaces .",
    "it would seem therefore that the magnetic transition temperature should also peak at @xmath69 .",
    "one intriguing reason why it would peak at @xmath40 is because magnetic order is more sensitive to disorder - induced suppression of the peak susceptibility whereas superconductivity is more robust .",
    "there is some support for this idea from the observation that isoelectronic doping produces a similar suppression of magnetic order than seen with hole - doping [ 51 ] . on the other hand , kimber _ et al _",
    "succeeded in rendering the parent bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 material to exhibit zero resistance at 30.5k by the application of significant external pressures up to 5.5gpa [ 55 ] , _ i.e. _ , without introducing disorder , but they remarked that superconductivity needs to be confirmed by other bulk measurement techniques .",
    "interestingly , the authors also correlate the induced @xmath12 with approaching a perfect tetrahedron angle of 109.5o similar to our observations for @xmath69 .    in summary , we have synthesized high quality samples covering the full phase diagram of ba@xmath0k@xmath16fe@xmath2as@xmath2 . using high resolution neutron powder diffraction and squid magnetization measurements ,",
    "we have investigated the effects of potassium substitution on superconductivity , structural transformation and magnetic ordering .",
    "our measurements allowed the construction of a detailed magnetic and structural phase diagram , which displays a narrower phase coexistence region than the previous reports .",
    "moreover , neutron diffraction and the squid magnetization data confirmed that magnetic and structural transitions are coincident with first order transitions .",
    "additionally , we determined the effects of temperature and substitution on the various internal atomic and structural parameters .",
    "our results confirm the importance of obtaining precise structural parameters across the whole phase diagram as a way of providing insight into the nature of the phase competition that underlies iron - based superconductivity ."
