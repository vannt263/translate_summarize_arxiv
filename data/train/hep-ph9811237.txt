    "it is often stated that the large value of the top - quark mass opens the possibility that it plays a special role in particle physics .",
    "indeed , the properties of the top - quark could reveal information on the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking , address questions in flavor physics , or provide special insight to new interactions originating at a higher scale .",
    "one consequence of its large mass is that top decays rapidly via @xmath11 , before the characteristic time for hadron formation and hence top - flavored meson states do not form .",
    "this results in a fundamentally different phenomenology for top than for the lighter quark states and allows for the unique capability to determine the properties of the quark itself@xcite .",
    "the precise determination of these properties may well reveal the existence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm)@xcite .",
    "one possible manifestation of new interactions in the top - quark sector is to alter its couplings to the gauge bosons .",
    "such anomalous couplings would modify top production and decay at colliders@xcite , as well as affecting loop - induced processes@xcite .",
    "the most widely studied cases are the @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 three - point functions . however , the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions @xmath15 also offer an ideal place to search for new physics as they are very small in the sm@xcite . in this instance",
    "any positive observation of these transitions would unambiguously signal the presence of new physics .",
    "the fcnc vertices can be probed either directly in top - quark decays , indirectly in loops , or via the production vertex for top plus light quark associated production .",
    "it is the latter case which is studied here in the reaction @xmath16 as will be discussed below , this mechanism offers some advantages due to the ability to probe higher dimension operators at large momenta and to striking kinematic signatures which are straightforward to detect in the clean environment of  collisions .",
    "deviations from the sm for the flavor changing vertices can be described by a linear effective lagrangian which contains operators in an expansion series in powers of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a high mass scale characteristic of the new interactions . in this case",
    "the lowest dimension gauge invariant operators built from sm fields are dimension six and can be written as@xcite [ dimsix ] l_eff & = & _ b^2",
    "|q_l^c_r b_+_w^2 |q_l^c_r _ aw^a _ + & & + _ b^2 |q_l^i_5c_r b_+_w^2 |q_l^ i_5c_r_aw^a_+h.c . , with @xmath19 being the field strength tensors for the three non - abelian fields of su(2)@xmath20 and the single abelian gauge field associated with u(1)@xmath21 respectively , @xmath22 is the conjugate higgs field @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the pauli spin matrices , and @xmath25 represents the third generation left - handed quark doublet .",
    "this effective lagrangian is then added to that of the sm and after spontaneous symmetry breaking it induces the dimension five operators in [ effl ] l & = & e|t i_q^m_t+m_c ( _ -i__5)c a^ + & & + g2c_w|tcz^+h.c.,where @xmath26 labels the momentum of the gauge boson . the dimension",
    "four terms can arise from anomalous contributions of terms like @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents the vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs field and @xmath29 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the coefficients of the dimension five terms are related to those of the dimension six operators above by  ^(^ ) _ & = & 2v^2(c_w  ^(_b^)+s_w  ^(_w^ ) ) , + g2c_w(m_t+m_c )  ^(^)_z & = & 2v^2(s_w  ^(_b^)-c_w  ^(_w^ ) ) . in the flavor",
    "conserving case , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the magnetic and electric dipole moment form factors , respectively , of the fermion to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "note that the @xmath31 terms are cp - violating .",
    "it is also possible to derive these operators from a non - linear effective lagrangian approach@xcite , where the exact form of eq .",
    "( [ effl ] ) can be derived in the unitary gauge with prescribed relations@xcite between the form factors and the parameters of the chiral expansion . in principle",
    ", the operator @xmath34 can also mediate fcnc interactions for non - zero values of @xmath35 , , @xmath36 , but we do not consider this possibility here . in the following ,",
    "we employ eq .",
    "( [ effl ] ) as a model independent parameterization of the effects of new physics on the fcnc three - point function and assume that the form factors are static .",
    "it is instructive to roughly estimate the relative sizes of the anomalous couplings .",
    "it is sensible to assume that the couplings @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ dimsix ] ) are naturally of @xmath38 .",
    "we thus expect that @xmath39 as well as @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ effl ] ) to be of @xmath41 .",
    "this estimate of course depends on the normalization scale which we have conveniently chosen as @xmath42 in order to correspond to the traditional dipole moment form factor definitions .",
    "if we took it to be scaled by @xmath43 tev instead , then the @xmath30 s would be roughly of order 1 .    a convenient way to compare the sensitivity of various processes to these anomalous form factors , as well as to evaluate their expected values in different models ,",
    "is to relate them to the fcnc partial widths of the top - quark . in the case of the dimension",
    "four operators , this can be readily computed and gives the branching fraction = ( m_t^2-m_z^2)^2(m_t^2 + 2m_z^2)(m_t^2-m_w^2)^2(m_t^2 + 2m_w^2 )  ( v_z^2+a_z^2)(v_z^2+a_z^2 ) . for the dimension",

    "as previously mentioned , the top fcnc branching fractions are unmeasureably small in the sm@xcite with @xmath44 , respectively , for @xmath45 gev",
    ". substantial enhancements of @xmath46 orders of magnitude can be obtained@xcite in flavor conserving two - higgs - doublet models and supersymmetry , however the resulting branching ratios remain small being of order @xmath47 at the largest .",
    "flavor changing multi - higgs - doublet models bring further enhancements@xcite with @xmath48 being possible .",
    "however , models with singlet quarks@xcite which contain tree - level fcnc , compositeness models@xcite , or models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite , which can all introduce effective flavor changing couplings of @xmath49 , can yield sizeable branching fractions of @xmath50 .    some models which induce fcnc",
    "are more naturally probed via top - charm associated production than in flavor changing top - quark decays due to the large underlying mass scales and possibly large momentum transfer .",
    "an illustration of this , which is particularly well suited to the reaction considered here , is that of topcolor assisted technicolor@xcite .",
    "tree - level fcnc for the additional neutral gauge boson present in this model are generated when the quark fields are rotated to the mass eigenstate basis .",
    "the couplings of this @xmath51 are non - universal and stronger for the third generation , yielding potentially large @xmath52 interactions . in addition",
    ", the production rate for this @xmath51 , which is constrained@xcite to be heavier than @xmath53 tev , is sizeable in high energy  collisions@xcite , and hence @xmath54 is the ideal place to search for this effect .",
