    "consider for example the random analytic function @xmath4 where the coefficients are i.i.d",
    ". then under general conditions , the zero set accumulates at the unit circle .",
    "a recent result @xcite has found the sharp condition for the zero set to be asymptotically uniformly distributed on the circle .",
    "this type of result is akin to a law of large number : for example ibragimov and zaporozhets prove that the empirical distribution of the zeros converges , almost surely , to the uniform distribution on the circle .",
    "various researchers have also considered the correlations between the zeros , under the assumption that the coefficients are all gaussian .",
    "for instance , a recent monograph of hough , krishnapur , peres and virg reviews this topic @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises : if the zeros of a random analytic function accumulate near the boundary , even under the assumption that the coefficients are not gaussian , what can we say about the correlations of the zeros near the boundary ? for general reasons ,",
    "one expects the distribution of the zeros to converge back to the distribution of the zeros of the gaussian analytic function , when properly rescaled .",
    "that is what we prove .",
    "one would expect to have various applications of such a result . however , some desired applications are presenly out of reach .",
    "the polynomials corresponding to random matrices and spin glasses generally do not have i.i.d .",
