    "the detailed process by which energy is released in the sun s atmosphere remains poorly understood . in active regions ( ars ) ,",
    "the heating of material and acceleration of particles occur impulsively in flares , but even when there appear to be no flares , ars still contain loops of material heated to several million kelvin .",
    "one proposed solution is to have episodic heating , with events frequent enough to smooth out the time series ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite described this explanation in magnetohydrodynamic terms as the natural development of small current sheets in magnetic flux tubes that appear as coronal loops , and coined the term `` nanoflare '' to represent the idea , estimating that an individual event might contain @xmath5 the energy of a major flare .",
    "this coronal energy release would be driven by the movement of the magnetic loops footpoints .",
    "these need to be sufficiently slow ( longer than the alfvn time for wave propagation ) otherwise waves would dominate and be an alternative heating mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the nanoflare conjecture implies that the plasma temperature temporarily , and locally , will exceed the mean @xcite .",
    "individual nanoflares are likely to be so small that they will be difficult to detect , but their presence should be observable through the impact of an unresolved ensemble .",
    "the spectrum would contain a range of temperatures reflecting an assortment of nanoflares at different energies and stages of their energy redistribution .",
    "extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) observations with _ sdo_/aia and _ hinode_/eis of non - flaring ars typically show a differential emission measure ( dem ) peaked about 3  mk , steeply falling off to higher and lower temperatures . the slope of the dem is well studied over @xmath6  mk due to the number of euv lines observable from quiescent regions , giving scalings of @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with high - frequency events , where the time between impulsive heatings is shorter than the cooling timescale @xcite .",
    "the higher temperature ( @xmath85  mk ) slope has considerably larger uncertainties , due to weaker euv diagnostics .",
    "it appears to be steeper , with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "observed lines include ( _ sumer _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( _ eunis _ ; * ? ? ?",

    "sdo_/aia 94  can also be used to access .",
    "the hottest material would produce x - ray emission but is difficult to detect given the expected weak signal and instruments designed for brighter flares .",
    "_ hinode_/xrt has been used with _",
    "hinode_/eis @xcite and _ rhessi _ @xcite to constrain the high temperature component .",
    "x - ray spectrometers are required to robustly diagnose this hottest emission but there have been few instruments capable of quiescent ar observations : a bragg crystal on a skylark sounding rocket @xcite and _ smm _ s flat crystal spectrometer ( fcs ) .",
    "these show weak emission from lines with peak formation temperatures up to 10  mk but emission mainly over 3 - 5  mk , with very steeply falling dems above 5  mk .",
    "observations above 2  kev typically have poorer spectral resolution but the bremsstrahlung continuum dominates .",
    "temperature diagnostics from the continuum have the advantage of being insensitive to non - equilibrium ionization that can affect line measurements .",
    "full - disc observations of various `` non - flaring '' ars have found higher temperatures of up to 11  mk with a _",

    "similar physics seems possible given that flare energies appear to behave as a power - law frequency distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the occurrence increasing with decreasing magnitude",
    ". accelerated electrons are detectable in flares via their bremsstrahlung emission at higher x - ray energies ( @xmath810  kev ) but for quiescent periods these signatures have remained elusive .",
    "_ rhessi _ has been prolific at observing flare / microflare hxrs but struggles with quiescent emission due to its indirect imaging and high non - solar background .",
    "only high - temperature emission was found for quiescent ars using _ rhessi _ @xcite and 3 - 200  kev upper limits for the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "the _ foxsi _",
    "sounding rocket has higher x - ray sensitivity and direct imaging and has briefly observed the sun twice .",
    "it was able to constrain the high temperature emission from a non - flaring ar but has not detected anything non - thermal @xcite .",
    "the presence of accelerated electrons has been suggested from _ iris _ ultraviolet observation @xcite , as the rapid variability of intensities and velocities at hot coronal loop footpoints are consistent with simulations of heating by accelerated electron beams .",
    "however x - ray observations are needed to definitively detect non - thermal emission .",
    "in this paper we present the first directly imaged and spectrally resolved x - rays above 2  kev from quiescent ars using the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ nustar _ is the first focusing optics telescope that covers the hxr bandpass ( 2.5 - 78  kev ) and has a higher sensitivity than _ rhessi _",
    "@xcite , with an effective area @xmath10 larger at @xmath11  kev and lower background .",
    "_ nustar _ provides a unique x - ray view of the sun but is not an optimized solar telescope .",
    "the solar pointings therefore present challenges , especially to use _ nustar _ s full sensitivity .",
    "we briefly discuss this in  [ sec : ns_sum ] and a full discussion is available in @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : ns_data ] we present _ nustar _ x - ray images and spectroscopy of several ars observed on 2014 november 1 , showing detection of emission at @xmath0  mk .",
    "we determine constraints to the emission above 5  mk , which are an order of magnitude more restrictive than previous observations , in  [ sec : ht ] .",
    "_ nustar _ carries two identical co - aligned mirror modules that focus onto two focal - plane modules ( fpma , fpmb ) .",
    "each has a @xmath12 field of view ( fov ) and fwhm of @xmath1318@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the focal - plane modules are @xmath15 arrays of cdznte detectors each with @xmath16 pixels operated in a photon - counting mode .",
    "it has a useable energy - range of 2.5 - 78  kev with a resolution of @xmath17  kev fwhm below 20  kev .",
    "the effective area is well calibrated down to 3  kev , with only small deviations to 2.5  kev , becoming substantial at lower energies due to trigger threshold uncertainty ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the readout time per event of 2.5 ms gives a maximum throughput of 400 counts sec@xmath18 per module .",
    "the data are processed using the _ nustar _ data analysis software v1.5.1 and _ nustar _ caldb 20150414 , generating an event list from which images / spectra are created . to reduce the effects of pile - up ",
    "multiple low energy photons being recorded as a single high energy count ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  we restrict our analysis to single - pixel ( `` grade 0 '' ) events @xcite .",
    "s optics are such that objects outside the fov can add to the detected background via photons that reflect only once , instead of twice for properly focused photons , allowing them to reach the focal plane as `` ghost rays '' @xcite .",
    "these have a well - characterised shape and behaviour . without detailed knowledge of the brightness and variability of the ghost ray sources , no corrections are possible .",
    "optimal _ nustar _ solar observations therefore require weak sources outside the target region .",
    "the data in this paper are from the first solar science campaign on 2014 november 1 @xcite , consisting of four orbits of observations ( each about an hour ) .",
    "we present the analysis of the fourth orbit as it provides the most stable view of ars near the west limb and has the highest livetime , with effective exposures of about @xmath19 and @xmath20 seconds .",
    "figure  [ fig : lght_mos ] shows the fourth orbit observations starting 21:34  ut 2014 november 1 , which consists of four pointings ( p1 , p2 , p3 , and p4 ) going from solar w  to n. for the majority of this orbit the solar position was found by a single combination of star trackers , or camera head units ( chus ; @xcite ) .",
    "a given chu combination is accurate to @xmath211.5@xmath22 @xcite and varies with the pointing .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "images from p1 and p2 are individually shifted to match the ar locations from the euv / sxr images ( see figure [ fig:8img ] ) . as there are no clear features in p3 , the p2 shift was used . for p4",
    "there are no sources and it is a different chu combination , so data from the previous orbit during the same combination , while observing the ars , were used for co - alignment .    the time series in figure  [ fig : lght_mos ]",
    "compares the _ nustar _ livetime percentage ( averaged over fpma and fpmb , individually similar ) with the _ rhessi _ and _ goes _ observations .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "livetime is very low ( about 0.4@xmath23 ) and near constant during p1 , which is due to the quiescent ars .",
    "these regions can be seen in the @xmath24  kev image in figure  [ fig : lght_mos ] , from fpma and fpmb combined . in p2 ,",
    "the livetime increases due to fewer ars in the fov and increases further in p3 and p4 once there are no ars in the fov . in these pointings the background ( blue - green in figure  [ fig : lght_mos ] ) is ghost rays from ars on the disk ( the imaged limb ones and those elsewhere on the disk ) .",

    "s fov , detected by _ goes _ and _ rhessi _ , appearing as a dip in the _ nustar _ livetime due to the increase in ghost rays . during the times",
    "when _ nustar _ was directly imaging the limb ars , the full disc _ goes _ flux was @xmath25  wm@xmath26 , mostly coming from ars outside _ nustar _",
    "these ghost rays are about @xmath27 weaker than the directly imaged ars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so will have a negligible contribution .      combining the p1 and p2 data we produce 2 - 4 kev and 4 - 6 kev livetime - corrected images ( with @xmath137@xmath14 gaussian smoothing ) , and compare these to _ sdo_/aia euv and _ goes_/sxi soft x - ray ( sxr ) images ( figure  [ fig:8img ] ) .",
    "the regions in euv / sxr show little variability during the _ nustar _ observation time , and those shown are averaged over that period .",
    "in the _ nustar _ 2 - 4 kev image there are five distinct regions which match features in the euv / sxr images .",
    "they correspond to ( and we label as ) noaa ar12195 ( d1 ) , ar12196 ( d2 ) , and above - the - limb sources ( l1 ) , highly occulted ar12192 ( l2 ) and ar12194 ( l3 ) .",
    "the major region ar12192 produced several x - class flares when on the disk and contained expansive coronal loops , still visible above the limb in euv / sxr .",
    "_ sdo_/aia 94 s temperature response contains cooler ( 0.5 - 1  mk ) and hotter ( 3 - 10  mk ) components @xcite .",
    "so for comparison to the _ nustar _ images we isolate the emission above 3  mk , from ( bottom right figure  [ fig:8img ] ) .",
    "these show that the hottest emission is from more compact regions , the brightest from l2 and l3 .",
    "this agrees with the _ nustar _ 4 - 6 kev image , which only shows discernible emission from these locations .",

    "the regions observed in both p1 and p2 show similar values for each fit , within the relative calibration @xcite .",
