    "uranium intermetallic compounds often exhibit interesting magnetic behavior that is neither very localized nor very itinerant .",
    "unisn and updsn are considered to be well localized with small linear specific - heat coefficient , @xmath6 mj / mol k@xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 mj / mol k@xmath7 @xcite , respectively , and with the large ordered magnetic moments of @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite , respectively , which are significantly larger than in other u intermetallic systems .",
    "both unisn and updsn exhibit interesting phase transitions with the antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground states .",
    "unisn displays an af order below the neel temperature @xmath11 k , a structural transition from the cubic symmetry to the tetragonal symmetry at @xmath12 @xcite , and a semiconductor - to - metal ( s - m ) transition around @xmath13 k @xcite .",
    "this multiple phase transition seems to be anomalous because it is an inverse metal - insulator transition with a gap - opening above @xmath12 and the structural , s - m , and afm transitions occur concomitantly .",
    "hexagonal updsn also displays two af transitions with concomitant lattice distortions .",
    "updsn undergoes an af transition below @xmath14 k with the orthorhombic magnetic symmetry ( phase i ) , and undergoes another afm transition below @xmath15 k with the monoclinic magnetic symmetry ( phase ii ) @xcite .",
    "both af structures in updsn are reported to be noncollinear .",
    "the resistivity of updsn shows a metallic behavior in the whole temperature range but with a feature of rapid drop below @xmath14 k @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism of the peculiar multiple phase transitions in unisn and updsn has been investigated extensively @xcite . a quadrupolar ordered phase based on the crystalline electric field ( cef ) level scheme for the localized @xmath16 ( u@xmath17 )",
    "configuration @xcite has been proposed for the phase transitions in utsn @xcite , which seems to be consistent with the neutron inelastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the localized @xmath18 ( u@xmath19 ) configuration was proposed based on the neutron diffraction data for updsn @xcite .",
    "some electronic structure calculation for updsn supports the localized u @xmath16 configuration @xcite , whereas other calculations argue the itinerant character of u @xmath0 electrons in unisn @xcite and updsn @xcite . neither the theoretically predicted electronic structure of utsn nor the @xmath16 configuration of the localized u@xmath17 ion has been verified by photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) experiment . an early resonant photoemission spectroscopy ( rpes )",
    "study on utsn ( t = ni , pd , pt ) with a rather poor instrumental resolution @xcite did not address the origin of the phase transitions in utsn .",
    "a recent pes study on unisn by some of the present authors @xcite has found the importance of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath5 between u @xmath0 electrons .",
    "therefore the nature of @xmath0 electrons in utsn is still controversial .    in order to explore the role of the electronic structures in the phase transitions of utsn",
    ", we have performed the rpes measurements of utsn ( t = ni , pd ) near the u @xmath20 absorption edge and determined the partial spectral weight ( psw ) distributions of both the u @xmath0 and ni / pd @xmath4 electrons .",
    "we have then compared the experimental data to the electronic structure calculation performed in the lsda+@xmath5 method ( lsda : local spin - density functional approximation ) @xcite .",
    "unisn and updsn polycrystalline samples are made by arc melting constituent elements of high purity @xcite .",
    "our magnetization measurements taken on the sample after one month annealing showed clear antiferromagnetic transitions in agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "photoemission experiments were carried out at the ames / montana erg / seya beam - line at the synchrotron radiation center .",
    "the details of pes experiment are the same as those described in ref .",
    "the total instrumental resolution [ fwhm : full width at half maximum ] was about @xmath21 mev and @xmath22 mev at @xmath23 ev and @xmath24 ev , respectively .",
    "high resolution photoemission spectra were taken with the fwhm of about @xmath25 mev .",
    "the photon flux was monitored by the yield from a gold mesh and all the spectra reported were normalized to the mesh current .",
    "temperature ( t)-dependence of pes was also investigated below and above the af transition temperature . for t - dependent pes measurements",
    ", the chamber pressure stayed below @xmath26 torr during heating .",
    "the low - t pes spectra were reproduced after the heating - cooling cycle .",
    "the electronic structures of utsn have been calculated by employing the self - consistent lmto ( linearized muffin - tin - orbital ) band method .",
    "the partial densities of states ( pdos ) have been calculated by using the lsda+@xmath5 band method incorporating the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction , so that the orbital polarization is properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "the von barth - hedin form of the exchange - correlation potential has been utilized .",
    "figure  [ edc ] shows the valence - band spectra of utsn ( t = ni , pd ) in the photon energy ( @xmath27 ) range of @xmath28 ev . at low @xmath27 s ( @xmath29 ev ) ,",
    "the contribution from the sn @xmath30 electron emission is non - negligible ( @xmath31 ) , and the cross - sections ( @xmath32 ) of u @xmath33 and t @xmath4 electrons are comparable to one another ( @xmath34 ) @xcite . @xmath35 ev , @xmath36 ev , and @xmath37 ev correspond to the off- and on - resonance energies due to the u @xmath38 and u @xmath39 absorptions , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore the emission enhanced at @xmath36 and @xmath37 ev can be identified as the u @xmath0 emission .",
    "the off - resonance spectrum at @xmath35 ev is dominated by the ni and pd @xmath4 emission because , at this @xmath27 , the sn @xmath30 electron emission is negligible with respect to the t @xmath4 emission ( @xmath40 of the ni / pd @xmath4 emission ) and the u @xmath0 emission is suppressed . using the u @xmath20 rpes , we have determined the u @xmath0 psw of utsn . before subtraction , the off - resonance spectra",
    "have been multiplied by a factor of 0.94 and 0.6 for unisn and updsn , respectively , in order to account for the @xmath27 dependence of other conduction - band electrons .",
    "figure  [ psw](a ) compares the extracted @xmath0 psws of utsn ( t = ni , pd ) to those of a nearly heavy fermion system ual@xmath41 @xcite and a typically localized @xmath0 system upd@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "all the spectra are scaled at the peak .",
    "upd@xmath42 is known to be a tetra - valent ( u@xmath17 ) intermetallic uranium compound with a localized @xmath16 configuration , and so the @xmath0 peak in upd@xmath42 is assigned as the @xmath43 transition @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath0 electrons in ual@xmath41",
    "is expected to be itinerant , and so the @xmath0 peak close to @xmath2 in ual@xmath41 is considered to represent the fully relaxed @xmath44 final states ( @xmath452 , 3 , 4 ) , under the assumption of the @xmath46 ground state configuration .",
    "interestingly the extracted u @xmath0 spectra of unisn and updsn are very similar each other , even though the on- and off - resonance spectra are very different .",
    "they have common features , such as a pronounced peak centered at about 0.3 ev binding energy ( be ) and a tail to about 3 ev below @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is found that , as one moves from ual@xmath41 to utsn and upd@xmath42 , the centroid of the @xmath0 electron peak moves away from @xmath2 and its width becomes wider .",
    "this trend is accompanied by the decreasing @xmath0 spectral weight at the fermi level , n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) .",
    "compared to the large @xmath0 spectral weight near @xmath2 in ual@xmath41 , n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) in utsn is lower than that in ual@xmath41 , suggesting that u @xmath0 electrons in utsn are more localized then in ual@xmath41 .",
    "this finding is consistent with the fact that unisn and updsn have large ordered magnetic moments ( @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "the u @xmath0 psw of unisn is very similar to that of updsn .",
    "the similarity in the u @xmath0 psw between unisn and updsn suggests that the interaction between u @xmath0 electrons in utsn ( t = ni , pd ) is mediated mainly by the hybridization to conduction - band electrons , rather than by the direct @xmath48-@xmath48 hopping @xcite , as explained below .",
    "the average u - u separation @xmath49 in updsn ( @xmath50 ) is much shorter than that in unisn ( @xmath51 ) , but is rather close to that in ual@xmath41 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "@xmath53 in updsn lies on the border of the hill limit ( @xmath54 ) @xcite , beyond which the u @xmath0 electrons are observed to form local moments .",
    "if we consider the average u - u separation only , the direct @xmath48-@xmath48 hopping among u @xmath0 electrons is expected in updsn ( even if it may be weak ) , while it is expected to be negligible in unisn .",
    "thus the interaction between u @xmath0 electrons in utsn should be mediated by the hybridization to conduction - band electrons , such as u @xmath33 , sn @xmath30 , and t @xmath4 electrons .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the fact that unisn and updsn have significantly larger ordered magnetic moments than in other u intermetallic systems @xcite .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering study also found rather well - defined cef excitations in utsn ( t = ni , pd ) @xcite .",
    "figure  [ psw](b ) compares the @xmath35 ev off - resonance spectra of unisn and updsn , which can be considered to represent the experimental ni @xmath55 and pd @xmath56 psws , respectively . to find a correlation between the u @xmath0 psw and the hybridization effect",
    ", we compare the off - resonance spectrum ( @xmath35 ev ) of ual@xmath41 for which n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) is very large .",
    "the spectrum for ual@xmath41 is reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite and it is scaled so that the area @xmath2 and @xmath57ev be is comparable with that in unisn .",
    "it is shown that the pd @xmath56 peak lies at a higher be ( @xmath58 ev be ) than ni @xmath55 peak ( @xmath59 ev be ) and its fwhm ( @xmath59 ev ) is much wider than that of ni @xmath55 peak ( @xmath60 ev ) .",
    "the latter difference reflects the less localized nature of pd @xmath56 states than ni @xmath55 states .",
    "then the more spread wave functions of the pd @xmath4 electrons than those of the ni @xmath55 electrons would yield the larger spatial overlap between u @xmath0 and pd @xmath56 wave functions . on the other hand , due to a higher be of pd @xmath56 peak",
    ", the energy overlap between u @xmath0 and pd @xmath56 wave functions would be small so as to weaken the hybridization .",
    "it is thus expected that the effective hybridization in unisn and updsn becomes more or less similar .",
    "note that both the pd @xmath56 and ni @xmath55 psws reveal a very low spectral intensity near @xmath2 , i(@xmath2 ) , which is of comparable magnitude if the main @xmath4 peaks are scaled at their maxima .",
    "in contrast , ual@xmath41 reveals a much larger i(@xmath2 ) than utsn .",
    "this finding indicates that the reduced n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) in utsn arises from the energy - dependent hybridization matrix elements m@xmath61 between the u @xmath0 states and the t @xmath4 states that have a very low dos at @xmath2 .",
    "this interpretation implies that the energy - dependent hybridization , instead of the average hybridization strength , plays an important role in determining n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) in uranium compounds .",
    "figure  [ hr ] shows the temperature dependence of the high - resolution pes spectra of utsn ( t = ni , pd ) in the vicinity of @xmath2 , obtained at @xmath62 ev with fwhm @xmath63 mev .",
    "all the spectra were obtained with the same measurement conditions except for temperature .",
    "the top panel compares the high - resolution t=15 k pes spectra of utsn and pt metal .",
    "pt is chosen as representing the typical metallic fermi - edge spectrum . in this comparison ,",
    "all the spectra are scaled at about 300 mev below @xmath2 .",
    "the solid line along the measured spectrum of pt metal is the result of the flat dos with a non - zero slope , cut - off at @xmath2 by the 15 k fermi distribution function , and convoluted with a gaussian function with fwhm @xmath64 mev .",
    "figure  [ hr ] shows that the high - resolution pes spectra of utsn in the vicinity of @xmath2 are almost identical each other and that there is certainly a finite metallic dos at @xmath2 in utsn .",
    "it is clearly shown that the slope of the pes spectrum of utsn just below @xmath2 is lower than that of pt , indicating a lower dos at @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to a flat dos with a non - zero slope for pt , the 15 k spectra of utsn are described well by the v - shaped metallic dos near @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the v - shaped metallic dos represents a model with a reduced but finite dos at @xmath2 which is usually formed in semi - metallic systems .",
    "this difference confirms that utsn have a lower dos at @xmath2 than a typical metal , in agreement with a low n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ psw ] ) .",
    "the middle panel compares the spectra of unisn , obtained at @xmath65k ( black line ) , which belongs to the af metallic phase , to that at @xmath66 ( gray line ) which belongs to the paramagnetic semi - conducting phase .",
    "similarly , the t - dependence of the spectra of updsn is shown in the bottom panel , obtained at t@xmath67 k ( black lines ) , the monoclinic af phase , t@xmath64 k ( gray lines ) , the orthorhombic af phase , and t@xmath68 k ( open dots ) , the paramagnetic phase , respectively .",
    "nearly no changes have been observed in the pes spectra of utsn across magnetic phase transitions , except that due to the temperature broadening .",
    "therefore the same v - shaped metallic dos is expected to provide a reasonably good fit to the measured spectra for updsn at 30k , 60k , and 90 k. our study indicates that both unisn and updsn have finite metallic doss at @xmath2 in different magnetic phases , suggesting that there are no appreciable changes in their electronic structures across the magnetic phase transitions .",
    "figures  [ ulda1 ] and  [ ulda2 ] show the calculated pdoss per atom of unisn and updsn , respectively , obtained from the lsda@xmath69 calculations .",
    "tetragonal and orthorhombic af structures are considered for unisn and updsn , respectively , and the collinear spin configurations are assumed for both systems .",
    "the on - site coulomb correlation parameter @xmath5 for the u @xmath0 electrons is included in these calculations .",
    "the parameters used in this calculation are the coulomb correlation @xmath70 ev and the exchange @xmath71 ev and @xmath72 ev for unisn and updsn , respectively .",
    "the on - site coulomb correlations for the ni @xmath55 and pd @xmath56 electrons have been neglected .",
    "the lsda+@xmath5 yields the correct metallic ground states for the af phase of utsn ( t = ni , pd ) , and the correct semiconducting and metallic ground states for the paramagnetic phases of unisn and updsn , respectively .",
    "the major effect of including @xmath5 in the lsda+@xmath5 is to shift both the occupied @xmath0 peaks and the unoccupied @xmath0 peaks away from @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the second effect of the lsda+@xmath5 is to shift the u @xmath4 , t @xmath4 , and sn @xmath73 pdoss toward @xmath2 .",
    "the larger the @xmath5 value is , the larger the peak shifts . for utsn ( t",
    "= ni , pd ) , the calculated orbital and spin magnetic moments for u ions are @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( unisn ) , and @xmath74 and @xmath76 ( updsn ) , respectively , and so the total magnetic moments of u ions become @xmath77 ( unisn ) and @xmath78 ( updsn ) .",
    "these values are in reasonable agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "the spin magnetic moments of u @xmath0 states , @xmath79 for both unisn and updsn , reflect that the number of occupied @xmath0-electrons is close to two ( @xmath16 ) with u@xmath17 configuration .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath48-electrons in unisn and updsn are not so localized as in upd@xmath42 due to the large hybridization with the neighboring elements .",
    "therefore the @xmath48-electron count is not really meaningful in these intermetallic compounds .    for both unisn and updsn , the u @xmath48 states exhibit the exchange - split @xmath0 bands , separated from each other by about @xmath80 ev and @xmath81 ev , respectively .",
    "the other states ( u @xmath4 , t @xmath4 , sn @xmath73 ) exhibit nearly no exchange splitting , indicating that the spin - polarization in utsn is mainly due to the u @xmath48 electrons .",
    "the ni and pd @xmath4 bands are nearly filled with a very low dos at @xmath2 , in agreement with the pes data ( see fig .  [ psw ] ) .",
    "the sn @xmath73 states are spread over the whole valence band , but relatively more concentrated at @xmath82 ev below @xmath2 . the u @xmath4 , t @xmath4 , and sn @xmath73 pdoss share common features , indicating the large hybridization among them .",
    "the dos at @xmath2 is low for unisn , but high for updsn .",
    "it is because that the fermi level in unisn cuts the valley of u @xmath48 dos , while the fermi level in updsn is located near the second peak of the u @xmath48 dos .",
    "this difference arises from the different crystal structures of unisn and unisn .",
    "figure  [ comp ] compares the extracted psws ( dots ) of utsn ( t = ni , pd ) to the calculated pdos , obtained from the lsda@xmath69 calculations ( solid lines ) . in the comparison to the pes spectra ,",
    "only the occupied part of the calculated pdoss was taken , and then convoluted by a gaussian function with 0.2 ev at the fwhm .",
    "the gaussian function has been used to simulate the instrumental resolution .",
    "the effects of the lifetime broadening and photoemission matrix elements are not included in the theory curves .",
    "at the bottom panels , the theoretical spectra correspond to the sum of the u @xmath4 , t @xmath4 , and sn @xmath73 pdos , because none of the contributions are negligible at @xmath62 ev and it is difficult to separate them out ( see the discussion under fig .",
    "[ edc ] ) .",
    "the lsda@xmath69 calculation provides a reasonably good agreement with pes for updsn , but not so for unisn .",
    "the calculated u @xmath0 pdos for updsn shows a metallic dos at @xmath2 , resulting in good agreement with pes .",
    "in contrast , the calculated u @xmath0 pdos for unisn shows a very low dos at @xmath2 , resulting in large disagreement with pes .",
    "the nearly negligible dos at @xmath2 for t @xmath4 states ( t = ni , pd ) in the lsda@xmath69 calculations gives good agreement with pes .",
    "for updsn , the peak positions in the lsda@xmath69 agree very well with the pes spectra for pd @xmath4 and sn @xmath30 states .",
    "the most pronounced discrepancy in unisn is that the calculated peak positions in the ni @xmath4 and sn @xmath73 pdoss appear at higher bes than in the pes spectra by more than 0.5 ev .",
    "the calculated u @xmath48 peaks in the occupied part also appear at higher bes than in pes , and the calculated n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) is too small , as compared to pes .",
    "it is rather surprising that the lsda@xmath69 calculation for updsn gives a good agreement with the measured u @xmath0 pes , whereas that for unisn does not .",
    "this finding indicates that the more localized nature ni @xmath55 electrons , as compared to pd @xmath56 electrons , plays an important role in determining the nature of u @xmath0 electrons in unisn , probably via the hybridization to u @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the electronic structures of utsn ( t = ni , pd ) have been investigated by performing the photoemission experiment and the lsda+@xmath5 electronic structure calculation .",
    "the extracted u @xmath0 spectra of utsn are very similar to each other , showing the u @xmath0 peaks at @xmath83 ev be . compared to the u @xmath0 psws of a nearly heavy fermion system ual@xmath41 and a typically localized @xmath0 system upd@xmath42 , the centroid of the @xmath0 electron peak moves away from @xmath2 from ual@xmath41 to utsn and upd@xmath42 , accompanied by the decreasing @xmath0 spectral weight at the fermi level , n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) , which suggests that the localization of u @xmath0 electrons in utsn is between those in ual@xmath41 and upd@xmath42 .",
    "the similarity in the u @xmath0 psw between unisn and updsn suggests that the interaction between u @xmath0 electrons in utsn is mediated mainly by the hybridization to conduction - band electrons , rather than by the direct @xmath48-@xmath48 hopping .",
    "both the ni @xmath55 and pd @xmath56 psws show the main peaks well below @xmath2 and a very low dos at @xmath2 .",
    "the high - resolution pes spectra of utsn are also very similar each other , with the slope just below @xmath2 being lower than that of pt .",
    "they are described well by a v - shaped metallic dos near @xmath2 , consistent with the reduced @xmath0 dos at @xmath2 .",
    "the temperature - dependent high - resolution pes spectra of utsn do not manifest any noticeable change in their electronic structures across the magnetic phase transitions .",
    "both the high - resolution pes and the t @xmath4 psws suggest that the reduced n@xmath3(@xmath2 ) in utsn is ascribed to the hybridization to the very low t @xmath4 dos at @xmath2 .",

    "comparison of the measured pes spectra to the lsda+@xmath5 band structure calculation reveals a reasonably good agreement for updsn , but not for unisn , indicating the importance of the on - site coulomb interaction not only for u @xmath0 electrons but also for t @xmath4 electrons .",
