    "in a remarkable recent report , t. haxton and a. liu ( hl )  @xcite have described molecular - dynamics simulations of a simple , sheared , two - dimensional , glass - forming material over three decades of steady - state strain rates @xmath0 , and for bath temperatures @xmath1 ranging from about one tenth of the glass transition temperature @xmath2 to about twice @xmath2 .",
    "most importantly , by measuring pressure fluctuations , hl have determined values of the effective disorder temperature @xmath3 for each value of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the shear stress @xmath4 .",
    "this extensive data set tests the applicability of any theory of amorphous plasticity such as the shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory discussed here , and also probes the limits of validity of the effective - temperature concept .",
    "@xcite we find that the main features of the stz theory presented in earlier papers  @xcite nicely survive these tests .",
    "moreover , several of the theory s specific ingredients , which had not been tightly constrained by earlier experiments or simulations , can be refined and extended in light of the hl data .",
    "our most surprising conclusion is that , for @xmath5 , the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath3 is a direct analog of the relation between the @xmath6 relaxation rate and the bath temperature @xmath1 near a conventional glass transition .",
    "it is well - known ( e.g. see @xcite ) that , for unstressed glass - forming materials in a range of temperatures above some @xmath7 , the viscosity @xmath8 is  at least to a first approximation  a simple activated process with a temperature - independent energy barrier .",
    "below @xmath7 , @xmath8 depends super - arrheniusly on @xmath1 , diverging as @xmath1 decreases toward the glass transition temperature ( or kauzmann temperature ) @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ arr1](a ) shows that the hl data for the viscosity in the limit of vanishing strain rate can be fit by a function of the form @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is an arrhenius activation energy that we interpret as the energy of formation for an stz .",
    "@xmath12 is a model - dependent function , to be specified later , that diverges as @xmath13 and vanishes for @xmath14 .",

    "the data points correspond to temperatures @xmath20 ( stars),@xmath21 ( squares ) and @xmath22 ( triangles ) .",

    "we also define @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fundamental time scale that appears in the dynamical stz equations of motion .",
    "thus , @xmath28 is a dimensionless rate of molecular rearrangements or , equivalently , a stirring rate .",
    "the hl results are expressed in terms of a molecular time scale , @xmath29 , which is derived from their molecular interactions and is not necessarily the same as @xmath27  although the two times should have about the same order of magnitude .",
    "we find it convenient to set @xmath30 , and to incorporate any difference between these time scales into the parameter @xmath31 defined below in eq .",
    "( [ f - s ] ) . for clarity , however , we occasionally retain explicit factors @xmath27 .",
    "we propose that the rate @xmath28 be interpreted as a purely kinetic quantity , independent of the specific mechanism by which the rearrangements occur .",
    "we then define @xmath32 to be the dimensionless , steady - state , effective temperature at stirring rate @xmath28 . to a first approximation",
    ", we assume that @xmath32 is independent of @xmath16 for @xmath33 . as we shall see later",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath32 becomes more interesting for larger @xmath16 .    in the limit @xmath34",
    ", the number of rearrangements depends only on the extent of the deformation and not its duration ; thus the condition for steady - state equilibrium is that , with high probability , each molecule has changed its neighbors at least a few times .",
    "it follows that @xmath35 is a nonzero constant , also independent of the rearrangement mechanism .",
    "we then postulate that the inverse function @xmath36 is the rate at which rearrangements occur when the system is driven so that its steady - state effective temperature is @xmath37 . then , in analogy with eq.([eta - t ] ) , we write @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants to be determined , and @xmath41 is a super - arrhenius function that diverges at the effective kauzmann temperature @xmath42 and vanishes above some @xmath43 .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the hl data .",

    "there are large uncertainties in the data at small strain rates ( large @xmath18 ) , but the existence of arrhenius and super - arrhenius regions is apparent .",
    "note that the arrhenius region , i.e. the section of the curve that is linear in @xmath18 , seems to extend all the way to infinite @xmath44 .",
    "ordinarily we do not think of arrhenius formulas remaining valid out to high temperatures .",
    "the difference here may be that the effective temperature pertains only to a fraction of the degrees of freedom in this system ; so , perhaps in analogy to magnetic spin temperatures , the maximally disordered state at infinite @xmath44 is realistic .",
    "one of the most interesting features of eq.([q - chi ] ) is that @xmath44 diverges at a finite strain rate , @xmath45 as seen from the extrapolation shown in fig .",
    "[ arr1](b ) . for molecular systems where @xmath27 is of order femtoseconds",
    ", @xmath46 is an impossibly large rate ; but it is accessible in numerical simulations and perhaps also in granular systems or the like . the system must liquify in some sense when driven faster than @xmath39 ; and the stz theory must break down near that point .",
    "in order to use eq.([q - chi ] ) to compute stresses , strain rates and effective temperatures for @xmath16 both below and above @xmath24 , we need a complete set of dynamical equations of the kind provided by the stz theory . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the version of that theory that was presented in @xcite , specializing to steady - state motion but otherwise retaining the generality needed to describe plasticity over the wide range of driving conditions studied by hl .",
    "we need one structural modification of this theory , which we explain following eq.([m - s ] ) below ; and our analysis requires model dependent rate factors that differ from those used in earlier papers .",
    "we start by writing the stz equations in a form determined by the basic structure of the theory .",
    "then , in the following subsection , we specify our choice of the model dependent ingredients of these equations .    in keeping with the emphasis of hl and the results of recent stz analyses such as @xcite , we write this theory in a form in which the effective temperature @xmath44 is the single , dynamically relevant , internal state variable . accordingly",
    ", we need just one equation for the dimensionless strain rate @xmath28 as a function of the shear stress @xmath4 and the effective temperature @xmath44 , supplemented by the steady - state version of an equation of motion for @xmath44 .",
    "the equation for the strain rate has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a model - dependent function ( to be specified shortly ) , and @xmath49 is proportional to the stz density .",
    "this clean separation between the stress - dependent and @xmath44-dependent parts of the plastic strain rate is an important characteristic feature of the stz theory that has been emphasized recently by shi et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the equation for @xmath44 is @xmath50=k(\\chi)\\,\\rho(\\theta)\\,\\left({\\chi\\over\\theta}-1\\right).\\ ] ] this is essentially the steady - state version of eq.(3.5 ) in @xcite ; but here we have written it in a form that is more appropriate for situations in which @xmath32 can become large .    according to eq.([chi1 ] ) , @xmath44 finds its steady - state value when the rate at which it is being driven mechanically toward its kinetically optimal value @xmath32 , on the left - hand side , is balanced by the rate at which @xmath44 relaxes toward the bath temperature on the right .",
    "@xmath51 , another model - dependent function , is proportional to the rate at which the work done by the driving force is dissipated as configurational entropy ; thus @xmath51 vanishes at @xmath52 .",
    "the function @xmath53&for $ \\theta > \\theta_0$\\cr 0 & for $ \\theta < \\theta_0$}\\ ] ] is the super - arrhenius part of the @xmath6 relaxation rate . because @xmath54 vanishes for @xmath55 , eq.([chi1 ] )",
    "implies that the low - temperature , steady - state value of @xmath44 is @xmath32 as anticipated in eq.([q - chi ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath56 appearing in eq.([chi1 ] ) is proportional to the density of sites at which thermal equilibration events  as opposed to shear - transformations ",
    "take place .",
    "we assume here , as in @xcite , that @xmath57 with @xmath58 , which means that both kinds of sites are comparably populated .",

    "the function @xmath64 is the orientational variable that emerges in the role of a back stress in the stz theory .",
    "it satisfies the steady - state relation : @xmath65\\bigl[1-m(s)\\,s / s_0 \\bigr ] = m(s)\\,\\rho(\\theta).\\ ] ] here , and in the equation for @xmath51 that follows , we depart slightly from the equations derived in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the yield stress @xmath66 was assumed to be approximately equal to a temperature - independent constant @xmath67 , and the stress was everywhere written in units of that constant . here ,",
    "on the other hand , it is obvious ",
    "most visibly in the hl graphs of stress versus strain rate at low - temperatures  that @xmath66 must be a function of @xmath16 .",
    "examination of the derivation of the stz equations in @xcite indicates that the factor of proportionality between @xmath51 and the energy dissipation rate per stz , which was set equal to @xmath67 there primarily for dimensional reasons , should have been a possibly temperature - dependent stress that we now call @xmath68 .",
    "the result of this change is that a factor @xmath4 , which multiplies the strain rate in the expression for the rate at which plastic work is done on the system , is replaced by @xmath69 , and the explicit @xmath4 that appears in eq.([m - s ] ) now becomes @xmath69 .",
    "this change in the analysis removes an ambiguity in the older stz theories ; e.g. see @xcite details will be published elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    the significance of the quantity @xmath68 is that below the glass transition temperature it is closely related to the dynamical yield stress @xmath66 . for @xmath55 and @xmath70",
    ", @xmath66 is the value of @xmath4 for which the two factors on the left - hand side of eq.([m - s ] ) vanish simultaneously ; therefore it is the solution of the equation @xmath71 because @xmath72 in all cases and is approximately equal to unity at low temperatures , @xmath73 . if @xmath68 is a function of @xmath16 in eq.([sy ] ) , then @xmath66 also is temperature dependent .",
    "although there is no yield stress for @xmath74 , @xmath48 still changes abruptly at @xmath75 for @xmath16 not too much larger than @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that at stresses close to @xmath68 , the stress vs. strain rate curve exhibits an abrupt change in slope .    the stz formula for the dissipation rate @xmath51 appearing in eq .",

    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath81 for @xmath55 , confirming that the energy dissipated is equal to the work done on the system when configurational relaxation can not occur via thermal fluctuations alone . above the glass transition ,",
    "on the other hand , the external work is not the same as the dissipation , and the use of eq.([gamma ] ) is necessary for accurate calculations .",
    "we turn now to the stz forward transition rate @xmath82 . here",
    "we depart from the choices made in earlier papers @xcite , where we were concerned with experiments and simulations performed only at relatively small driving forces , and which therefore did not sharply constrain our choice of @xmath82 .",
    "hl have provided a data set that goes up to stresses more than ten times the yield stress , at temperatures both well above and well below the glass transition , and thus have made it necessary for us to consider this rate factor in a broader context than before .",
    "we need a function @xmath82 that interpolates between eyring - like behavior at very small stresses and power - law growth at very large ones . in choosing such an @xmath82",
    ", we find that we must depart from our earlier , purely phenomenological procedure of choosing simple functions with very few adjustable parameters , in the expectation that whatever data we had available would not justify additional theoretical complications . here",
    "we are facing a very different situation . in order to interpret the hl data , we find it better to start with a physically motivated model containing an uncomfortably large number of parameters .",
    "determining the values of these parameters is made easier in places by the fact that we can fit some parts of the data independently of other parts , and then see how these initially separate pieces of the puzzle fit together , for example , in connecting our predictions of behaviors at very small strain rates to those at very large ones .",
    "another advantage of this more nearly first - principles procedure is that we can guess the magnitudes of many parameters on physical grounds , and also know the limits of validity of physics - based approximations .",
    "for example , we know that the eyring - like formula that we use for the stz transition rate breaks down at the highest temperatures simulated by hl ; and thus we know to assign less weight to our theory at those temperatures in fitting the hl viscosity curve .",

    "we expect @xmath86 , because the barrier opposing stz transitions from one state to the other should be less than the barrier opposing creation of new stz s .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 is related to the curvature of this barrier at its peak .",
    "it appears here ostensibly in the same place where @xmath67 appeared in @xcite , but now it has no direct connection to the yield stress . in the limit of small stress",

    "we normalize the nominal yield stress @xmath93 so that @xmath94 and measure stresses @xmath4 in units of this zero - temperature yield stress .",
    "the crossover stress @xmath92 determines when the system departs from eyering stress - activated behavior .",
    "the exponent @xmath95 in eq.([r - s ] ) is especially interesting . in strongly dissipative systems ,",
    "we expect @xmath96 , indicating that the stz transition rate is controlled at large stresses by some linear dissipative mechanism such as friction or viscosity . in the opposite limit ,",
    "where rates are controlled by collisions between primarily hard - core objects and the detailed molecular interactions are relatively unimportant , we expect to find bagnold scaling.@xcite that is , if there is no natural energy or stress scale in the problem , then dimensional analysis requires that the stress be proportional to the square of a rate .",
    "since @xmath63 is the only available quantity with dimensions of inverse time , we must have @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it appears that the latter case is more consistent with the hl viscosity data .",
    "other model - dependent ingredients that we must specify are the super - arrhenius function @xmath12 and its analog @xmath41 . here",
    "we adopt formulas motivated by the excitation - chain theory of the glass transition @xcite proposed recently by one of us . for present purposes ,",
    "these formulas need not be interpreted as anything more than phenomenological fits to experimental data .",

    "the conventional interpretation of these stress peaks is that the as - quenched state of the system has a low fictive temperature @xmath44 with a correspondingly small population of stz s , and that plastic flow can not begin until enough deformation has occurred to increase @xmath44 to a value of order @xmath42 .",
    "the fictive temperature can not be below @xmath24 , so stress peaks could not be produced by this process if @xmath156 .",

    "this lowered transition temperature would mean , for example , that the hl curves of stress versus strain rate shown in fig.[hl : sq ] for values of @xmath16 down to @xmath158 , would bend over and exhibit viscous behavior at strain rates much smaller than those measured by hl .",
    "if that were the case , then @xmath42 would be substantially higher than @xmath24 , and the transient behavior of the hl model might be more interesting than predicted at the end of the last paragraph .      in order to extend our analysis to temperatures above the glass transition ( kauzmann ) temperature @xmath24 and to arbitrary strain rates , we must reexamine our assumption that the effective kauzmann temperature @xmath42 is independent of the bath temperature @xmath16 . to see what is happening here , we take advantage of our simplifying assumption that @xmath159 in eq.([k - chi ] ) and solve this equation for @xmath44 : @xmath160 note that , for @xmath74 , we can take the limits @xmath161 and @xmath162 in different orders and get different answers . if we take the limit of vanishing @xmath28 first , so that @xmath51 vanishes , then @xmath163 .",
    "however , if we let @xmath16 go to @xmath24 first , so that @xmath54 vanishes , then @xmath164 for sufficiently small @xmath28 .",
    "we see no _ a priori _ reason why the crossover between these limiting behaviors described by eq.([chiss ] ) can not be physically correct for a temperature independent @xmath42 ; but that assumption is qualitatively inconsistent with the hl data .",
    "equation ( [ chiss ] ) implies that @xmath44 always must lie between @xmath16 and @xmath32 ; but we have found ( in a calculation not shown here ) that , if we choose @xmath165 to be a @xmath16-independent constant , then the hl data in fig.[hl : qchi ] for @xmath166 and @xmath167 lie above the allowed range in the transition region between the small-@xmath28 and large-@xmath28 limits .",
    "a physically plausible alternative is to assume first that @xmath168 ( the inequality being consistent with the existence of transient stress peaks ) , and then that @xmath169 whenever @xmath16 exceeds @xmath42 .",
    "that is , @xmath170 with this assumption , @xmath171 is a continuous function of @xmath16 across the glass transition and , for @xmath172 , there are no small-@xmath28 steady - state solutions other than @xmath173 . nothing in this hypothesis precludes @xmath42 itself from being a function of temperature .",
    "in fact , we think we see a hint in the hl data that @xmath42 may be a decreasing function of @xmath16 up to the point where @xmath174 , beyond which @xmath169 .",
    "the assumption in eq.([hatchi0 ] ) accurately fits the hl data . in implementing eq.([hatchi0 ] ) , we have simply rescaled the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath175 in eq.([alpha - chi ] ) so that the ratios @xmath176 and @xmath177 remain the same in both low and high temperature regions .",

    "[ hl : etaq ] .",
    "the small strain - rate asymptote of these curves for temperatures above the glass transition is @xmath183 , and the way in which the stress crosses over from its power - law dependence at large @xmath28 to the yield stress or newtonian viscosity at small @xmath28 is strongly sensitive to stz transition rate parameters @xmath87 and @xmath92 .",
    "we find that @xmath148 and @xmath133 fit the crossover behavior quite well .    the curves in fig .",
    "[ hl : etaq ] show the stz solutions for @xmath135 vs. @xmath136 at temperatures above and below the glass transition . for temperatures above the glass transition",
    ", @xmath184 is very similar to the cross form used by hl to extrapolate their data .",
    "however , the stz solutions for @xmath185 asymptote to a slightly smaller value of @xmath8 as @xmath161 than the one specified by hl .",
    "it is unclear how to best extrapolate this stress / strain rate data to @xmath52 , and this uncertainty explains why the hl viscosity values in fig .",
    "[ arr1]a are slightly larger than the stz fit .",
    "the natural way in which the stz theory accounts for the wealth of data provided by the haxton - liu simulations lends credibility to major elements of that theory , especially the form of the expression for the plastic strain rate in eq.([q - s ] ) and the central role played by the effective disorder temperature .",
    "the self - consistent evaluation of parameters in section [ hldata ] depends directly on the first of these elements ; and the remarkable appearance of an effective glass transition in the nonequilibrum glassy state seems to confirm the second . nevertheless , unanswered questions abound . we conclude by listing some of them .",
    "_ how close is the analogy between the thermal and effective - thermal glass transitions ? _ the analogy does seem surprisingly close , but there are interesting and potentially very important differences .",
    "we think that the near equality of the transition temperatures @xmath24 and @xmath42 , if correct at all , must be an artifact of the hl model .",
    "we have argued here that @xmath24 must be substantially smaller than @xmath42 in many realistic circumstances ; and we suspect that this inequality might even turn out to be true in the hl model if measurements could be made at appreciably smaller strain rates .",
    "it already is apparent that the effective arrhenius activation energy @xmath186 in eq.([q - chi ] ) is larger than the thermal activation energy @xmath11 by a factor of about @xmath187 ; thus there is no universality in the energy scales .",
    "why not ?",
    "we see an even deeper question in this regard . as discussed in the paragraph preceding eq.([q - chi ] ) , the fact that @xmath32 goes to a nonzero value @xmath42 in the limit of small @xmath28 seems to have a robust explanation in purely kinetic terms .",
    "is a similar argument relevant to the thermal glass transition ?",
    "would it imply that the viscosity  the analog of @xmath188  rigorously does diverge at @xmath24 ?",
    "_ what should the stz transition rate @xmath82 really look like ? which features of it are model dependent ?",
    "which have some degree of universality ? _ in eq.([r - s ] ) , we have tried to go part of the way toward deducing @xmath82 from first - principles , many - body physics .",
    "doing this correctly would be analogous to using statistical mechanics to compute the viscosity in the navier stokes equations .",
    "the problem here is harder , of course , because we do not yet have a precise definition of an stz .",
    "nevertheless , this problem needs to be given more thought in view of the new information we have obtained from the hl results .",
    "one especially intriguing aspect of this question emerges from our observation that @xmath82 exhibits bagnold scaling at large @xmath4 . under",
    "what circumstances may we expect this to happen ?",
    "is it special to the hl model ?",
    "ordinarily , we think of bagnold scaling as being relevant to the large - stress behavior of the strain rate as a whole , i.e. to @xmath189 in present notation ; whereas our @xmath189 behaves quite differently .",
    "the special feature here is that the bagnold behavior is modified by the stz density , i.e. the factor @xmath190 in eq.([q - s ] ) , which is strongly @xmath28 dependent .",
    "we suspect that the full bagnold behavior would occur at strain rates larger than @xmath39 , where the stz density is not a meaningful quantity , but where the hl model might look like a rapidly flowing granular material",
    ". a better understanding of this large-@xmath28 situation might provide insight regarding the applicability of stz theory to granular systems .",
    "_ will the present version of the stz theory accurately predict the time - dependent transient behavior of the hl model ?",
    "_ one of the principal successes of earlier applications of the stz theory has been that it correctly accounts for response times observed , for example , in transient stress - strain experiments .",
    "the key idea here is that there is a separation of time scales between slow processes , i.e. relaxation of plastic flow or disorder temperature , as opposed to fast processes like the response to perturbations of the stz orientation variable @xmath191 that appears in eq.([m - s ] ) .",
    "that separation seems problematic at the upper end of the scale of strain rates used by hl .",
    "we have no problem with it here because we consider only steady - state behavior .",
    "it will be interesting to look at transient behavior in the hl model to see where the fully dynamic version of the stz theory may break down . before doing that , however , it will be important to look at less esoteric behavior , e.g. transient responses to changes in driving forces of systems initially quenched at different rates to temperatures near the glass transition .",
    "do such systems exhibit stress peaks ?",
    "the model that we have used for interpreting the hl data , in which @xmath165 , implies that they should not occur here .",
    "might transient experiments reveal that , as we suspect , @xmath192 ?    _ what are the implications for strain localization ? _",
    "the effective temperature provides a mechanism for strain localization in amorphous materials  regions with a higher effective temperature are more likely to undergo plastic deformation , which generates heat that increases the local effective temperature .",
    "although previous studies assumed a constant value for @xmath193  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ q - chi ] ) shows that this assumption is only valid near the effective glass transition .",
    "the fact that @xmath193 increases with increasing strain rate is likely to enhance localization and may permit steady state localized solutions .",
    "_ what role do thermal fluctuations play in determining the properties of the effective glass transition ? _",
    "we already have concluded that @xmath171 must be equal to @xmath16 at high temperatures , @xmath172 ; but we have little knowledge about what happens to the corresponding @xmath42 when @xmath194 , and have simply assumed that it is a constant .",
