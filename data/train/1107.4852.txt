    "network routing problems involve the selection of a pathway from a source to a sink in a network .",
    "network routing is encountered in logistics , communications , the internet , mission planning for unmanned aerial vehicles , telecommunications , and transportation , wherein the cost effective and safe movement of goods , personnel , or information is the driving consideration . in transportation science and operations research",
    ", network routing goes under the label _ vehicle routing problem _ ( vrp ) ; see bertsimas and simchi - levi ( @xcite ) for a survey .",
    "the flow of any commodity within a network is hampered by the failure of one or more pathways that connect any two nodes .",
    "pathway failures could be due to natural and physical causes , or due to the capricious actions of an adversary .",
    "for example , a cyber - attack on the internet , or the placement of an improvised explosive device ( ied ) on a pathway by an insurgent .",
    "generally , the occurrence of all types of failures is taken to be probabilistic .",
    "see , for example , gilbert ( @xcite ) , or savla , temple and frazzoli ( @xcite ) who assume that the placement of mines in a region can be described by a spatio - temporal poisson process .",
    "the traditional approach in network routing assumes that the failure probabilities are fixed for all time , and known ; see , for example , colburn ( @xcite ) .",
    "modern approaches recognize that networks operate in dynamic environments which cause the failure probabilities to be dynamic .",
    "dynamic probabilities are the manifestations of new information , updated knowledge , or new developments ( circumstances ) ; de vries , roefs and theunissen ( @xcite ) articulate this matter for unmanned aerial vehicles .",
    "the work described here is motivated by the placement of ied s on the pathways of a logistical network ; see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "our aim is to prescribe an optimal course of action that a decision maker @xmath0 is to take vis -  - vis choosing a route from the source to the sink . by optimal action we mean selecting that route which is both cost effective and safe .",
    "@xmath1 s efforts are hampered by the actions of an adversary @xmath2 , who unknown to @xmath0 , may place ied s in the pathways of the network . in military logistics",
    ", @xmath2 is an insurgent ; in cyber security , @xmath3 is a hacker . @xmath0 s uncertainty about ied presence on a  particular route",
    "is encapsulated by @xmath0 s personal probability , and @xmath0 s actions determined by a judicious combination of probabilities and @xmath0 s utilities . for an interesting discussion on a military planner s attitude to risk ,",
    "see @xcite ( @xcite ) who claim that individuals tend to be risk prone when the information presented is in terms of losses , and risk averse when it is in terms of gains .",
    "methods for a meaningful assessment of @xmath0 s utilities are not on the agenda of this paper ; our focus is on an assessment of @xmath0 s probabilities , and the unconventional statistical issues that such assessments spawn .    to cast this paper in the context of recent work in route selection under dynamic probabilities , we cite ye et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who consider minefield detection and clearing . for these authors ,",
    "dynamic probabilities are a consequence of improved estimation as detection sensors get close to their targets .",
    "the focus of their work is otherwise different from the decision theoretic focus of ours .",
    "we suppose that @xmath0 is a coherent bayesian and thus an expected utility maximizer ; see lindley ( @xcite ) .",
    "this point of view has been questioned by de vries , roefs and theunissen ( @xcite ) who claim that humans use heuristics to make decisions .",
    "the procedures we endeavor to prescribe are on behalf of @xmath4 .",
    "we do not simultaneously model @xmath2 s actions , which is what would be done by game theorists .",
    "rather , our appreciation of @xmath3 s actions are encapsulated via likelihood functions , and modeling socio - psychological behavior via subjectively specified likelihoods is a novel feature of this paper .",
    "fienberg and thomas ( @xcite ) give a nice survey of the diverse aspects of network routing dating from the 1950s , covering the spectrum of probabilistic , statistical , operations research , and computer science literatures . in thomas and fienberg ( @xcite )",
    "an approach more comprehensive than that of this paper is proposed ; their approach casts the problem in the framework of social network analysis , generalized linear models , and expert testimonies .",
    "we start section  [ sec2 ] by presenting a subnetwork , which is part of a real logistical network in iraq , and some ied data experienced by this subnetwork . for security reasons , we are unable to present the entire network and do not have access to all its ied experience .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] pertains to the decision - theoretic aspects of optimal route selection .",
    "we discuss both the nonsequential and the sequential protocols .",
    "the latter raises probabilistic issues , pertaining to the `` principle of conditionalization , '' that appear to have been overlooked by the network analyses communities .",
    "the material of section  [ sec3 ] constitutes the general architecture upon which the material of section  [ sec4 ] rests .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is about the inferential and statistical matters that the architecture of section  [ sec3 ] raises .",
    "it pertains to the dynamic assessment of failure probabilities , and describes an approach for the integration of data from multiple sources .",
    "such data help encapsulate the actions of @xmath5 , and @xmath0 s efforts to defeat them .",
    "the approach of section  [ sec4 ] is bayesian ; it entails the use of logistic regression and an unusual way of constructing the necessary likelihood functions .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] summarizes the paper , and portrays the manner in which the various pieces of sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] fit together .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] also closes the paper by showing the workings of our approach on the network of section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] is a subnetwork abstracted from a real logistics network used in iraq .",
    "the subnetwork has nine nodes , labeled a ( not to be confused with adversary @xmath2 ) to i , and ten links , labeled 1 to  10 .",
    "the source node is a and the sink node is i.    there are thirteen bridges dispersed over the ten links of figure  [ fig1 ] , with link 9 having one bridge , the `` _ _",
    "new bridge__. '' this bridge is a mile away from a park , the old city , the bus station , and the mosque .",
    "the precise locations of the remaining 12 bridges in the subnetwork are classified .",
    "there have been four crossings on the `` new bridge , '' and none of these have experienced an ied attack . to plan an optimal route from source to sink , @xmath0 needs to know the probability of experiencing an ied attack on the next crossing on each of the ten links .",
    "however , we focus discussion on link 9 , because it is for this link that we have information on the number of previous crossings .    to assess the required probabilities , we need to have all possible kinds of information , including that given in table  [ tab1 ] , which gives the history of ied placements on the remaining twelve bridges of the subnetwork .",
    "the data of table  [ tab1 ] , though public , were painstakingly generated via information from multiple sources  such as google maps  by the so - called process of `` connecting the dots . '' generally ,",
    "such data are hard to come by via the public domain .",
    "the recently released wikileaks ( @xcite ) data has some covariate information on ied experiences in afghanistan",
    ". however , there are very few well - defined logistical routes in afghanistan , and those that may be there are not identified in the wikileaks database . furthermore , the covariate information that is available is not of the kind relevant to route selection .",
    "thus , for this paper , the wikileaks ",
    "afghanistan data are of marginal value .",

    "the other columns give the distance of the bridge , in miles , from population centers like a park , old city , bus station , and mosque .",
    "an entry of zero denotes that the bridge is next to the landmark . whereas data on ied attacks tends to be public ( because of press reports ) , data on the number of crossings by convoys , the number of ieds cleared , the composition of the convoys , etc .",
    ", remains classified .",
    "the three routes suggested by figure  [ fig1 ] are as follows : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "since ieds are placed by adversaries , @xmath4 is generally uncertain of their presence when planning begins . additionally , there are pros and cons with each route in terms of distance traversed , route conditions ( such as the number of curves and bends , terrain topology ) , proximity to hostile territory , receptiveness of the local population to harbor insurgents , and so on .",
    "in actuality , @xmath4 will have access to historical data of the type shown in table  [ tab1 ] , and also information about the nature of the cargo , the convoy speed , intelligence about the cunningness and sophistication of the insurgents , the number of previous unencumbered crossings on a link , etc.=-1    @xmath0 s problem is to select an optimal route between the three routes given above .",
    "a variant is to specify the optimal route _",
    "sequentially_. that is , start by going from a to c via links 1 and 2 , and then , upon arrival at c , make a  decision to proceed along link 9 to the sink , or to take the circuitous routes via the links 3 to 8 , and 10 , to get to the sink .",
    "similarly , upon arrival at node e , @xmath0 could proceed along link 10 , or via the links @xmath10 and 8 to arrive at the sink .",
    "@xmath0 s decision as to which choice to make will be based on @xmath4 s uncertainty of ied presence on the links 3 to 10 , assessed when @xmath0 is at node  c and at node e.    thus , optimal route selection is a problem of decision under uncertainty .",
    "because of the dynamic environment in which convoys operate , @xmath0 s uncertainties change over time . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we prescribe a decision - theoretic architecture for route selection .",
    "this requires that @xmath4 assess his ( her ) uncertainties about ied placements , as well as utilities for a successful or failed traversal . since @xmath0 s uncertainties are dynamic , the prescription of section  [ sec3 ] is also dynamic ; that is , the selected route is optimal only for an upcoming trip .",
    "the main challenge therefore is an assessment of the dynamic probabilities ; see section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "under the nonsequential protocol , @xmath0 needs to choose , at decision time , from the following : @xmath11 take route @xmath9 ; @xmath12 take route @xmath7 ; or @xmath13 take route @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath0 s decision tree for these choices , with each @xmath15 leading to a  random node @xmath16 , with each @xmath16 leading to an outcome @xmath17 ( for success ) and @xmath18 ( for failure ) , @xmath19 . here",

    ". with three choices , the decision tree for the sequential protocol will be analogous to that of figure  [ fig2 ] , save for the fact that the decision nodes will be at nodes c and e , instead of being at node a. the rest of the analysis parallels that described in the material following figure  [ fig2 ] [ cf .",
    "singpurwalla ( @xcite ) ] , save for one matter , namely , the caveat of conditionalization .      the _ principle of conditionalization _ ( poc ) pertains to probability assessments of two ( or more ) events , and the disposition of one of them becomes known [ cf .",
    "singpurwalla ( @xcite ) , page 21 , and ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "it arises because conditional probabilities are in the _ subjunctive mood_. when the disposition of the conditioning event becomes known , and the poc is upheld , the probability of the unconditioned event is its previously assessed conditional probability .",
    "when the poc is not upheld , one assesses the probability of the unconditioned event via a likelihood and bayes law , using the revealed value of the conditioned event as data .",
    "when sequential routing is done for strategic reasons , socio - psychological issues come into play , and then it is realistic to assess the probability of the unconditioned event via a likelihood .    to illustrate the above , consider the scenario of @xmath0 choosing a sequential protocol , and having arrived at node c needs to assess the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath62 is the probability of successfully arriving at the sink via links 2 and 9 .",

    "to summarize , the event @xmath160=1/[1+\\exp   ( -\\sum z_{u}\\beta _ { u}^{\\ast } ) ] $ ] has probability @xmath166 , and this provides us with a probability model for @xmath167 $ ] .",
    "consequently , a plot of @xmath168 versus @xmath169 provides the required likelihood function .    to implement this idea , we sample a @xmath170 from @xmath171 to obtain@xmath162=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp   ( -% \\sum _ { u}^{k}z_{u}\\beta _ { u}^{\\ast } ) } , \\]]and also @xmath172 .",
    "a plot of @xmath173 versus @xmath174 is then the likelihood function of @xmath110 in light of @xmath175 and @xmath103 ; see figure  [ fig4 ] .     with @xmath74 and @xmath103 known .",
    "]    with @xmath176 the prior on @xmath110 specified , and the likelihood @xmath177 induced via a logistic regression model governing @xmath156 and @xmath103 , the desired posterior@xmath178can be numerically assessed .",
    "once the above is done , all the necessary ingredients for obtaining equation ( [ eq4.3 ] ) , which can now be written as@xmath179are at hand .",
    "the above expression can be numerically evaluated .",
    "for both the nonsequential and sequential protocols wherein the poc is upheld , we need to assess conditional probabilities of the type @xmath180 , where links @xmath77 and @xmath75 are adjacent to each other , and",
    "traversing on @xmath77 precedes that on @xmath75 .",
    "there are two possible strategies .",
    "the first one is for @xmath0 to subjectively change the assessed @xmath181 by either increasing it because an insurgent might find it easy to populate neighboring links with ieds , or to decrease it if @xmath0 thinks that an insurgent has limited resources for placing ieds .",
    "the second approach is less subjective because it incorporates data on ied placements or nonplacements on neighboring links .",
    "the idea here is to treat the conditioning event @xmath182 as a covariate , so that the vectors @xmath175 and @xmath144 of sections  [ sec4.1 ] and  [ sec4.3 ] get expanded by an additional term , as @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "correspondingly , the matrix @xmath83 of section  [ sec4.1 ] also gets expanded to include an additional column whose @xmath85th term @xmath185 is @xmath186 whenever there has been an ied experience in a preceding link ; otherwise @xmath185 is @xmath6 . with the above in place , a repeat of the exercise described in section  [ sec4.3 ] would enable a formal assessment of the conditional probabilities .",
    "the only other matter that remains to be addressed pertains to the likelihood of @xmath110 as discussed in section  [ sec4.2 ] .",
    "since the likelihood is a  weight assigned to the posterior of @xmath110 , @xmath0 may either increase the @xmath125 of equations ( [ eq4.4 ] ) and ( [ eq4.5 ] ) , or decrease it depending on what @xmath0 thinks of an insurgent s abilities and resources .",
    "@xmath0 would increase @xmath187 if @xmath0 feels that the insurgent s resources are plentiful ; otherwise @xmath0 downgrades @xmath125 .",
    "equation ( [ eq4.7 ] ) shows how @xmath0 can assess @xmath38 , the probability of one or more ied placements on link @xmath39 in a unified manner by a systematic application of the bayesian approach .",
    "it entails a fusion of information on past ied experience on link @xmath39 ( encapsulated by @xmath90 ) , historical data on ied experience in the region ( encapsulated by the matrix @xmath117 ) , and @xmath0 s subjective views about @xmath38 , encapsulated via the likelihood @xmath125 and the prior @xmath153 .",
    "the essence of equation ( [ eq4.7 ] ) is that its right - hand side is the expected value of a weighted prior distribution of @xmath110 .",
    "the weighting of the prior is by the product of two likelihoods , one reflecting historical ied experience specific to link @xmath154 , and the other reflecting historical ied experience in the region as well as the relevant covariates specific to the forthcoming trip contemplated by @xmath0 .",
    "the entire development being grounded in the calculus of probability is therefore _",
    "coherent_.    though cumbersome to plough through , there are novel features to the two likelihoods .",
    "the first likelihood  equations ( [ eq4.4 ] ) and ( [ eq4.5])is an unconventional likelihood for use with bernoulli trials .",
    "it is motivated by socio - psychological considerations attributed to both the insurgents who place the ied s , as well as to @xmath0 , who does not become complacent upon a sequence of successful crossings and who upon the occurrence of the first failure adopts the posture of extreme caution . the second likelihood  that of figure  [ fig4]is induced in an unusual manner by leaning on the posterior distribution of the parameter vector of a logistic regression .",
    "the approach of section  [ sec4 ] displays the manner in which information from different sources can be fused by decomposing the likelihood of @xmath110 .",
    "equation ( [ eq4.7 ] ) shows this .",
    "the material of section  [ sec4 ] feeds into that of section  [ sec3 ] which pertains to sequential and nonsequential decision making under uncertainty .",
    "the computational and simulation work spawned by section  [ sec4 ] entails logistic regression , generating @xmath57-dimensional samples from the posterior distribution of @xmath144 , numerically assessing @xmath188equation ( [ eq4.6])and numerical integration to obtain @xmath189equation ( [ eq4.7 ] ) .",
    "none of these pose any obstacles .",
    "section  [ sec4.4 ] pertains to conditional probabilities .",
    "it expands on sections  [ sec4.1 ] through  [ sec4.3 ] , by treating the conditioning events as covariates .",
    "the one major obstacle pertains to the paucity of the data for validating the approach . the required data , namely , @xmath105 , @xmath74 , and @xmath190 , are available to the military logisticians , but are almost always classified .",
    "the wikileaks data tend to focus on ied explosions and not on success stories wherein ied s get cleared , similarly with other publicly available data .",
    "information that is relevant to constructing the likelihood based on socio - psychological considerations is highly individualized , and perhaps not even recorded .",
    "it is _ desirable _ to collect this kind of information via experiments pertaining to the psychology of logisticians and route planners , and also insurgents via what is known as `` red teaming . ''",
    "the text of this paper can be seen as a template for addressing network routing in a dynamic environment .",
    "the network architecture of figure  [ fig1 ] brings out the necessary caveats that problems of this type pose , one such caveat being the caveat of conditionalization , discussed in section  [ sec3.2.1 ] .",
    "real logistical networks are more elaborate . in actual practice the matrix  @xmath190",
    "could have a very large dimension and thus be unmanageable .",
    "however , given the role that @xmath103 plays , one may simply sample from a high dimensional @xmath103 to work with a more manageable matrix .",
    "besides a prior for @xmath110 , @xmath153 , all that is required of @xmath0 are the utilities mentioned in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "however , these utilities are proxies for costs , and no form of optimization can be achieved without cost considerations .",
    "finally , this paper shows how statistical methodologies can be constructively brought to bear in network routing problems which generically belong in the domain of computer science , network analysis , and operations research .",
    "we close this paper by illustrating in section  [ sec5.1 ] the workings of sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] by using the data of table  [ tab1 ] to assess the probability of encountering an ied on the next crossing on the `` new bridge . ''      with respect to the network of figure  [ fig1 ] , the data of table  [ tab1 ] maps to the matrix @xmath103 of section  [ sec4.1 ] , with its column 2 corresponding to @xmath191 column 3 corresponding to @xmath192 and so on , with column 6 corresponding to @xmath193 .",
    "a logistic regression model@xmath194for @xmath195 , with @xmath196 , was fitted to the data of table  [ tab1 ] using independent gaussian priors with means @xmath6 and standard deviations @xmath197 .",
    "this choice of priors is arbitrary .",
    "the joint posterior distribution of @xmath198 was obtained via gibbs sampling with 10,000 simulations after a burn - in of 1,000 simulations .",
    "the marginal posterior distributions of @xmath199 , and @xmath200 were symmetric looking , but those of @xmath201 and @xmath202 were skewed to the left ; plots of these distributions are not shown .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] compares posterior means against their maximum likelihood estimates , showing a good agreement between the two , save for @xmath203 .",
    ".comparison of bayes versus maximum likelihood estimates [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     about 60 samples from the joint posterior distribution of @xmath204 were generated , and for each sample , the quantity @xmath205^{-1}$ ] computed .",
    "here @xmath206 , suggesting that the next crossing is to be on the new bridge which is one mile away from all the four city centers of interest .",
    "associated with each generated sample is also the probability of the sample ; this is provided by the joint probability density .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows a plot of the computed quantity mentioned above [ our @xmath207 of section  [ sec4.3 ] ] versus the joint probability .",
    "a smoothed plot , smoothed by a moving average of five consecutive points , is the monte carlo induced likelihood .",
    "since the new bridge has experienced 4 previous crossings and none of these crossings have experienced an ied attack , @xmath208 ; thus , @xmath209 , see equation ( [ eq4.4 ] ) . with the above in place , all the ingredients needed to compute @xmath210equation ( [ eq4.7])are at hand , save for @xmath153 the prior . supposing @xmath153 uniform on @xmath155 , we have@xmath211with @xmath152 given by the likes of figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "this can be numerically evaluated for a range of @xmath110 , say , @xmath212 , to obtain @xmath213 .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath214 .",
    "the normalizing constant is @xmath215 , giving @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "thus , the probability of encountering an ied on the next crossing on the `` new bridge '' is 0.306 .      in order to prescribe an optimal route for the network of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we need to calculate the probability of encountering an ied on each of the remaining 9 links of the network in a manner akin to that given above for link 9 , the `` new bridge . ''",
    "this requires that we have the vectors @xmath105 and @xmath74 for each of these links , where  @xmath218 is the historic ied experience for a link , and @xmath74 is the vector of covariates associated with the links .",
    "this we do not have and are unable to obtain for reasons of security .",
    "consequently , and purely with the intent of illustrating how our decision theoretic framework can be put to work , we shall make some meaningful specifications about the @xmath38 s , @xmath219 .",
    "these will be based on the relative lengths of each link , relative to the length of link 9 for which @xmath220 has been assessed as 0.306 ; that is , calibrate the required @xmath38 s in terms of @xmath220 .",
    "to do the above , we start by remarking that links 1 and 2 are of almost equal length , and are about two - thirds the length of link 9 .",
    "links 3 to 8 are of equal length and are about one - fifth the length of link 9 , whereas link 10 is about half the length of link 9 .",
    "note that figure  [ fig1 ] is not drawn to scale .",
    "thus , we set @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "these choices are purely illustrative ; we could have used other methods of scaling such as the logarithmic or the square root .",
    "in addition to specifying the @xmath38 s , we also need to specify utilities .",
    "for this we propose a utility function of the form @xmath224 for a successful route traversal . here",
    "@xmath75 is the number of links in the route , and @xmath225 is a constant which ensures that a successful traversal does not result in a negative utility .",
    "specifically , the idea here is that a successful traversal yields a utility of one , but each link in the route contributes to a disutility to which is assigned a  weight @xmath226 .",
    "choice @xmath24 entails the route @xmath9 and with @xmath225 chosen to be 100 , the utility of a successful traversal on this route will be @xmath227 .",
    "similarly , the failure to achieve a successful traversal yields a utility of @xmath228 , yielding a negative utility of @xmath229 , which in the case of route @xmath9 with @xmath230 is @xmath231 .    the above choices for utility do not take into consideration things such as composition of the convoys , traversal time , vicinity to hostile territory , costs of disruption , etc . with the above in place , and assuming independence of the ied placement events , it can be easily seen that the expected utilities of choices @xmath24 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are 0.414 , 0.361 , and 0.430 , respectively .",
    "thus , for the given choices of probabilities and utilities , @xmath0 s optimal route will be @xmath30 , which is @xmath8 . observe that neither the shortest nor the longest routes are optimal .",
    "sensitivity of @xmath0 s final choice to values of @xmath225 other than 100 can be explored .",
    "for example , were @xmath225 taken to be 10 , then @xmath24 will turn out to be @xmath0 s optimal choice .",
    "this is because it turns out the probability of a successful traversal via choices @xmath24 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 turns out to be rather close to each other , namely , 0.444 , 0.441 , and 0.480 , respectively .",
    "this completes our discussion on illustrating the workings of the proposed approach vis -  - vis the network of figure  [ fig1 ] , and closes the paper .",
