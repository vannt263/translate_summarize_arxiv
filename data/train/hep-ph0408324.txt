    "the baryogenesis via electroweak phase transition is an interesting scenario to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe because it can be tested in the future high energy experiments [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "sakharov pointed out several decades ago three ingredients for generating dynamically the baryon asymmetry of the universe from a baryon - symmetric universe [ 4 ] . among them",
    "is the requirement that the universe should depart from the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the departure from thermal equilibrium is required to guarantee the first order phase transition at the electroweak scale .",
    "the strength of the first order phase transition must be strong enough for preserving the generated baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale .",
    "previous calculations indicate that there could be a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition in the standard model ( sm ) if the higgs boson has a mass of less than 35 gev , which is well below the experimental lower bound [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "lattice simulations have shown that the electroweak phase transition actually vanishes completely if @xmath0 75 gev [ 8 ] .",
    "thus , the sm in its conventional form eliminates the possibility of a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "it seems that the sm should be enlarged in order to revive the possibility .",
    "a number of suggestions have been published in the literature within the framework of the sm for the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition [ 9 - 17 ] .",
    "one line of thoughts is based on high dimensional operators . in the sm ,",
    "the phenomenological implications of the high - dimensional operators are considered in various papers [ 18 - 21 ] .",
    "it is already investigated that a strongly first order phase transition in the context of the electroweak phase transition is allowed for a relatively large higgs boson mass ( @xmath1 100 gev ) by considering a dimension - six higgs operator relevant to the tree - level higgs potential of the sm [ 22 ] .",
    "recently , the electroweak phase transition in the sm is investigated by considering a low cutoff on the dimension - six higgs operator [ 23 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to examine the possibility of a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition in the presence of a dimension - six operator in the higgs potential , at the one - loop level .",
    "we include the loops of gauge bosons , top quark , higgs and goldstone bosons into the one - loop contributions .",
    "we calculate the finite - temperature effective potential at the one - loop level by exact integration .",
    "we search the parameter space where the higgs boson has a reasonable mass and the where the electroweak phase transition is both first order and strong enough .",
    "the result of our calculations suggests that a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition is possible in the sm with a dimension - six operator if the higgs boson has a mass between 115 gev and 132 gev .",
    "the higgs potential in the sm consists of one higgs doublet @xmath2 where the real component of the neutral higgs field may be expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for the electroweak symmetry breaking and @xmath5 is the physical higgs boson .",
    "the conventional form of the tree - level higgs potential in the sm up to @xmath6 , at zero temperature , is @xmath7 to this higgs potential , we introduce a non - renormalizable dimension - six term , which may be defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a parameter for weakly coupled new physics and @xmath10 is a cutoff .",
    "the one - loop contribution at zero temperature is given by the effective potential method as [ 24,9,10 ] @xmath11 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively for @xmath17 boson , @xmath13 boson , top quark , the higgs boson , and the goldstone boson .",
    "the degrees of freedom for each particle are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and the field - dependent masses for each particle are given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the effective potential at the one - loop level for our purpose is @xmath28 at zero temperature .",
    "the mass of the physical higgs boson , @xmath29 , is obtained by substituting @xmath30 in the second derivative of @xmath31 .",
    "note that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 should be positive in order to be employed in @xmath34 .",
    "the condition that they should be positive yields a cutoff for @xmath35 .",
    "a typical value of the cutoff for @xmath10 is 912 gev , which is obtained from @xmath36 and the experimental lower bound on the higgs boson mass , @xmath37 gev , for @xmath38 .",
    "hereafter , we will set @xmath38 for simplicity , unless explicitly specified otherwise .",
    "one might consider the case of @xmath39 or the case of negative @xmath9 .    in fig .",
    "1a , we plot the higgs potential at zero temperature as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath38 , @xmath40 gev , @xmath29 = 115 gev",
    ". there are four curves in the figure : the solid curve represents @xmath41 , and the dashed curve @xmath42 . in the remaining two curves ,",
    "we neglect higgs and goldstone boson loops in the one - loop contribution . denoting the one - loop contribution without higgs and goldstone boson loops as @xmath43 , we plot @xmath44 ( dotted curve ) and @xmath45 ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "one can see that the solid curve is nearly identical to the dotted one and the dashed curve is almost identical to the dot - dashed one .",
    "this implies that the contributions of higgs and goldstone bosons in the one - loop effective potential is negligible , for @xmath38 , @xmath40 gev , @xmath29 = 115 gev . on the other hand , the effect of the presence or the absence of the dimension - six term , @xmath46 , is significant , as the two groups of curves show distinctively different patterns",
    "however , all of the the four curves show a minimum at @xmath47 gev , for finite @xmath15 . the vev @xmath4 of @xmath15 is defined as the minimum of the potential . as @xmath15 increases indefinitely",
    ", the potential without @xmath46 will eventually decrease to the negative infinity .",
    "therefore , the minimum at 246 gev is the global minimum for the potential with @xmath46 , whereas it is a local minimum for the potential without @xmath46 .",
    "this is already observed in a number of papers , for example , from ref . [ 25 ] . at the higher - order level",
    "the higgs potential may escape from decreasing indefinitely .    without the one - loop contribution @xmath48 , it has been observed that @xmath49 may not be the zero - temperature minimum of the potential [ 23 ] . in our case",
    ", the presence of the @xmath46 term ensures that the minimum of the potential occurs always at @xmath49 at zero temperature .",
    "thus , the minimum at 246 gev is the global one in our case .    in fig .",
    "1b , we plot the higgs potential at zero temperature as a function of @xmath15 . in this figure , we set @xmath50 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as fig .",
    "1a : @xmath40 gev , @xmath29 = 115 gev .",
    "there are two curves : the solid curve represents @xmath42 , and the dashed curve does @xmath45 . here , in fig .",
    "1b , the contribution of higgs and goldstone bosons is clearly significant .",
    "moreover , the minimum at @xmath51 gev for the solid curve is not a global one .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "1b indicates that the one - loop effective potential with @xmath46 for negative @xmath9 exhibits the same difficulty as the potential without @xmath46 for positive @xmath9 .",
    "hereafter , we do not consider the case of negative @xmath9 in the dimension - six higgs operator . a detailed analysis for negative @xmath9 can be found in ref . [",
    "now , we study the case of finite temperature",
    ". the one - loop contribution at finite temperature is given by [ 26 ] @xmath52 \\ , \\ ] ] where the negative sign is for bosons and the positive sign for fermions .",
    "here , we have @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively for @xmath17 boson , @xmath13 boson , top quark , the higgs boson , and the goldstone boson , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the full one - loop effective potential at finite temperature that we are considering can now be expressed as @xmath53    the above one - loop contribution at finite temperature may be approximated for high temperature as [ 6,9,10 ] @xmath54 \\cr & & \\mbox { } + \\sum_i n_i \\left [ { t^2 m_i^2 ( \\phi ) \\over 24 } - { t m_i^3 ( \\phi ) \\over 12 \\pi } - { m_i^4 ( \\phi ) \\over 64 \\pi^2 } \\log \\left ( { m_i^2 ( \\phi ) \\over a_b t^2 } \\right ) \\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is known that in the sm the high temperature approximation is consistent with the exact calculation of the integrals within 5 % for @xmath57 in the fermion case and for @xmath58 in the boson case .",
    "we would not only use the high temperature approximation but also perform the exact integrations in @xmath59 numerically .    the two curves in figs .",
    "2a and 2b show the results of the high temperature approximation as well as the exact integrations . in fig .",
    "2a , we plot @xmath60 in the high temperature approximation , as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath38 , @xmath40 gev , @xmath29 = 115 gev .",
    "the critical temperature is obtained as @xmath61 gev .",
    "one can see that there are two minima in the potential at @xmath62 gev and @xmath63 gev .",
    "these two minima consist of degenerate vacua , and allow the first - order phase transition .",
    "the symmetric phase state corresponds to the vacuum at @xmath62 gev while the broken phase state @xmath63 gev .",
    "we denote the critical value of the vev at the broken phase state as @xmath64 , that is , @xmath65 gev in this case .",
    "the ratio of @xmath64 and @xmath66 is a criterion for the strength of the first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "generally , it is regarded as a strong phase transition if @xmath67 at electroweak scale . in fig . 2a , @xmath68 is 1.102 , thus satisfying the criterion for the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition .    in fig .",
    "2b , we repeat the job using the result of exact integrations , and plot @xmath69 as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath38 , @xmath40 gev , @xmath29 = 115 gev",
    ". the critical temperature in this case is obtained as @xmath70 gev , which is slightly larger than the result in the high temperature approximation .",
    "the critical vev in this case is , as one can see from fig .",
    "2b , @xmath71 gev .",
    "thus , we have @xmath72 in fig . 2b . both the high temperature approximation and the exact integration suggest that for @xmath73 gev there can be a strongly first order phase transition at the electroweak scale , if the higgs potential includes a dimension - six operator .    in this way",
    ", we search the parameter space to examine if a strongly first order phase transition at the electroweak scale may take place for other set of parameter values .",
    "the ratio of @xmath68 decreases , or the strength of the phase transition becomes weak , as @xmath10 increases , for fixed higgs boson mass .",
    "thus , we carry out exact integrations for @xmath74 , varying @xmath10 from the cutoff value upward , for given higgs boson mass , and examine whether the ratio of @xmath68 stays above 1 or not .",
    "we then increase the higgs boson mass step by step and vary @xmath10 from the cutoff value upward and check the value of @xmath68 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath68 is actually obtained by taking the smallest , or the cutoff , value of @xmath10 , for given higgs boson mass , since @xmath66 increases and @xmath64 decreases as @xmath10 increases .",
    "the result of our search is summarized in table i , where the result is listed in the increasing order of the higgs boson mass .",
    "the first set of entries corresponds to the result of fig .",
    "note that the cutoff value decreases as the higgs boson mass increases , @xmath35 .",
    ".strongly first order electroweak phase transition for various higgs boson masses for @xmath38 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that the higgs boson mass in the first and the second set of entries in table 1 is the same .",
    "actually , we fix the higgs boson mass at @xmath73 gev and increase @xmath10 until the ratio of @xmath68 decreases down to about 1 .",
    "as we increase @xmath10 still further , the ratio is found to decrease below 1 .",
    "we find that @xmath10 may be as large as 950 gev for @xmath73 gev in order to ensure the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "one can see in table i that , if the higgs boson mass is smaller than 132 gev , the ratio of @xmath68 can be larger than or comparable to 1 for a certain value of @xmath10 above the cutoff value . therefore , table i tells us that the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition might take place if @xmath75 gev .",
    "a higgs boson with its mass between 115 gev and 132 gev is within the reach of future experiments .",
    "it can be discovered possibly in the tevatron experiments or in the lhc experiments in the near future .",
    "the possibility of the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition in the sm is studied by introducing a dimension - six higgs operator to the finite temperature higgs potential at one - loop level .",
    "the one - loop contributions due to gauge bosons , top quark , higgs and goldstone bosons are taken into account .",
    "finite temperature effects are also included by the one - loop finite - temperature correction . instead of employing the high temperature approximation",
    ", we carry out the exact integrations .",
    "the difference between the two method of calculations is not serious , but noticeable . for given higgs boson mass",
    ", we calculate the critical temperature ( @xmath66 ) with two degenerate global vacua and the critical value of the higgs field vev ( @xmath64 ) for the higgs boson mass .",
    "then , we examine whether @xmath68 is larger than 1 or not . in this way , we study if the condition for a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition is satisfied or not .",
    "we find that there are parameter space where @xmath68 is larger than or comparable to 1 for @xmath76 gev .",
    "thus , our study suggests that the sm higgs potential at the one - loop level with a dimension - six operator allows a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition , for the higgs boson mass between 115 gev and 132 gev . a higgs boson with this mass range",
    "might easily be searched in the future high energy experiments .",
