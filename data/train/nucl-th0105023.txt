    "the peculiar structure of halo nuclei is clearly revealed by fragmentation reactions @xcite .",
    "large interaction cross sections and narrow momentum distributions of the fragments observed after fragmentation of these nuclei are direct signs of their large spatial extension .",
    "the main properties of these nuclei are well described by few  body models @xcite , where the nucleus is viewed as an inert core surrounded by a few ( usually one or two ) bound nucleons . among them , borromean two  neutron halo nuclei have attracted a lot of attention , and their most prominent examples , @xmath0he and @xmath1li , have been widely investigated .    during the last decade a large amount of experimental data after fragmentation of @xmath0he and @xmath1li on different targets have been provided . in particular total dissociation cross sections and total interaction cross sections , as well as momentum distribution of the fragments after dissociation and after core breakup are available @xcite .",
    "different models describing these data have been developed .",
    "these models fall in two independent main groups according to the kind of reaction for which they were designed .",
    "the first one considers nuclear breakup processes , and therefore they apply to the case of light targets .",
    "most of them describe neutron dissociation reactions while core breakup is usually omitted @xcite . only calculations performed in the framework of the glauber theory are also providing total interaction cross sections @xcite .",
    "the second group focuses on heavy targets where only coulomb dissociation is considered @xcite .",
    "intermediate targets where nuclear and coulomb interaction compete is outside the scope of these models . at best coulomb and nuclear breakup are computed in independent models and subsequently simply added @xcite .",
    "the reaction mechanisms responsible for the breakup processes are still controversial @xcite , but absolutely essential to understand and analyze the data properly @xcite .",
    "it is established that few - body aspects of the halos are necessary . in most investigations",
    "halo constituents ( and targets ) are treated as inert particles where the intrinsic degrees of freedom are neglected or accounted for by finite range potentials with pauli forbidden states .",
    "however , the core degrees of freedom are unavoidable for some observables like interaction cross sections where core destruction is substantial .",
    "such many - body aspects must be included at some point while maintaining the necessary halo features .",
    "more than one reaction mechanism is necessary in a correct description of halo breakup .",
    "the long range coulomb and the short range nuclear potentials already lead to clear - cut differences @xcite",
    ". however the finite extension of halo particles and targets furthermore produces inevitable differences in the active reaction mechanisms at small and large impact parameters .",
    "this has strong implications for the understanding and the analyses .",
    "the starting point for developing our model was the recognition that , for large beam energies ( @xmath2 mev / nucleon ) , the time scales allow application of the sudden approximation for two - neutron @xcite and one - neutron halos @xcite .",
    "only light targets , relative momentum distributions and the specifically dominating processes were accessible within the sudden approximation .",
    "the next step was to use a participant - spectator separation and employ the phenomenological optical model to describe the interactions between participants and target @xcite .",
    "again only light targets were accessible but now absolute cross sections were computed .",
    "the model was then extended to treat the interactions between spectators and target in the black sphere model @xcite .",
    "finally the coulomb and nuclear interactions were included on the same footing allowing treatment of light , intermediate and heavy targets and computation of absolute values of all differential breakup cross sections @xcite .",
    "the reaction mechanisms now come out as clearly distinguishable for light and heavy targets or rather for small and large impact parameters .",
    "the small impact parameters involve violent collisions and one or more of the halo particles do not arrive in the detectors in the forward direction . at large impact parameters",
    "the momentum transfer is relatively small and the three halo particles are gently excited into the continuum state , which subsequently decays and all halo particles most likely arrive in the forward detectors .",
    "these two extremes are separated roughly at impact parameters slightly larger than corresponding to grazing collisions .",
    "these different reaction mechanisms imply that the two - step processes , where one halo particle is removed by the target while the resonance of the remaining system is populated followed by decay @xcite , at best only is consistent with small momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the large momentum transfer requires a completely different mechanism of halo particle removal .    in this paper",
    "we formulate for the first time in detail the model accounting for all these effects .",
    "so far no other model contains all the necessary features .",
    "the idea is to describe the fragmentation reaction as the sum of all the possible reactions where one , two or all three halo constituents interact simultaneously with the target .",
    "the processes leading to different final states clearly add up incoherently .",
    "the cross sections for the remaining processes are in all the numerical applications in this report also simply added as appropriate for large momentum transfer from the target .",
    "the model is consistently describing two  neutron halo fragmentation on any target with simultaneous treatment of nuclear and coulomb interactions .",
    "absolute values are computed for all possible dissociation cross sections distinguished according to the particles left in the final state .",
    "two  neutron removal cross sections , core breakup cross sections , interaction cross sections and momentum distributions are computed as function of target and beam energy above 50 mev / nucleon .",
    "we shall present results for a large variety of these observables arising from fragmentation reactions of @xmath0he and @xmath1li on c , cu , and pb .",
    "these three targets have been chosen as typical examples for light , intermediate and heavy targets displaying different reaction mechanisms due to the interplay of coulomb and nuclear interactions .",
    "details of the model are given in sections  [ sec2 ] and  [ sec3 ] .",
    "results for fragmentation reactions of @xmath0he and @xmath1li on c , cu and pb are shown in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally section  [ sec5 ] contains summary and conclusions .",
    "we consider a spatially extended three  body halo nucleus colliding with a target at high energy .",
    "let us first assume that the target and the three halo constituents in the projectile are inert particles .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath3 is to a good approximation given by the sum of three terms @xmath4 , each of them describing the independent contribution to the process from the interaction between the target and the halo particle @xmath5 .",
    "this is the assumption used in the classical formulation for a weakly bound projectile @xcite .",
    "we neglect the binding energy of the initial three - body bound state compared to the high energy of the beam .",
    "the reaction is then described as three particles independently interacting with the target as if each particle were free .",
    "each individual interaction with the target is viewed as removal of one particle @xmath5 ( participant ) while the other two particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( spectators ) both survive the reaction undisturbed ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the participant is either absorbed ( in the optical model sense ) or elastically scattered ( diffracted ) by the target .",
    "the masses , coordinates and conjugate momenta are denoted @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the three halo particles and the target are labeled by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the relative coordinates @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the corresponding conjugate momenta",
    "are analogously denoted by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we use primes to denote the momenta in the final state .",
    "detailed expressions for the different relative coordinates and momenta can be found in @xcite .",
    "the momentum transfer in the reaction for elastic scattering of the participant is then given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angle between @xmath19 and @xmath25 .",
    "for relatively large momentum transfer between participant and target the final state is appropriately described as two independent subsystems , i.e. the target plus participant and the two spectators .",
    "this separation is not a matter of convenience but dictated by physics , especially in connection with the generalization in the next section to spatially extended particles .",
    "this is a central assumption reflecting the reaction mechanism .",
    "it is discussed in previous publications and tested by comparison with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the transition amplitude of the process in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can then within the mixed plane / distorted wave born approximation be written as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the total angular momentum of the projectile and its projection on the @xmath29axis , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the spin and its third component of the two  body system formed by particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 after the collision , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the spin and projection quantum numbers of particle @xmath5 ( for convenience we assume a spin zero target ) , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the distorted wave functions of the two final two  body systems .",
    "we use plane waves @xmath36 and @xmath37 because these relative momenta are much higher and the plane wave approximation is suitable .    in the frame of the projectile ( @xmath38 ) , and assuming that the participant @xmath5 has spin 0 or 1/2 , the previous transition amplitude leads to the following differential diffraction cross section for the process in fig .  [ fig1 ] @xmath39 @xmath40 note that the final two  body wave function @xmath41 is contained in the differential elastic cross section for the participant  target scattering @xmath42 .",
    "the two  body wave function @xmath43 is computed as in @xcite and the appropriate phase factor is included in the computation of the overlap matrix element .",
    "when the participant @xmath5 in the sense of the optical model is absorbed by the target the corresponding differential absorption cross section factorizes as @xmath44    the final state wave function used in eq.([trans ] ) is not orthogonal to the initial wave function .",
    "this means that our final state contains a non - zero component of three  body bound state plus target , that represents elastic scattering of the halo nucleus as a whole , and has to be removed .",
    "this is done in eq.([elas ] ) by means of the function @xmath45 , that is the probability of dissociation of the three  body halo system . for elastic scattering",
    "the final state wave function of the halo nucleus is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the momentum transfer into the participant ",
    "spectators relative motion described by the coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the probability of elastic scattering of the three  body projectile as a whole is given by the square of the overlap between the initial and final three  body wave functions .",
    "this implies that the probability of dissociation is given by @xcite @xmath48 which vanishes as @xmath49 for small values of the momentum transfer .    in eqs.([elas ] ) and ( [ abs ] ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the differential elastic and absorption cross sections for the participant  target scattering ,",
    "respectively @xcite .",
    "we use a central participant  target nuclear potential @xmath52 , and assuming that the participant and the target have charges @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , the participant  target interaction is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .    the cross sections arising from the interaction @xmath57 in eq.([v0i ] )",
    "are obtained after integration of eqs.([abs ] ) and ( [ elas ] ) when particle @xmath5 is absorbed and elastically scattered , respectively .",
    "the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] arises when the halo breakup is caused by a sufficiently violent and fast participant - target reaction .",
    "however this is not true in processes in which contributions from small momentum transfers are dominating . in these cases the small kick of the participant excites the halo rather gently and the breakup process proceeds via the created wave packet .",
    "an obvious example is halo breakup on a heavy target caused by the coulomb participant",
    " target interaction , which clearly is a dominating process , especially at low beam energies @xcite .",
    "this type of gentle breakup reaction mechanism requires that the final state is that component of the three - body continuum halo wave function which at large distances approaches plane waves with relative momenta specified by @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the corresponding reaction is sketched in fig .  [ fig1a ] . the transition matrix in eq.([trans ] )",
    "should then be replaced by @xmath60 where @xmath16 now is the relative coordinate between the three  body system and the target , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are its conjugate momenta respectively in the initial and final state  note that in section 2.1 @xmath63 is the conjugate momentum of the relative radial coordinate between the center of mass of the two final two  body systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , while now @xmath62 is the conjugate momentum of the relative radial coordinate between the final three  body system and the target .",
    "the two spin wave functions @xmath64 are labeled by their respective final state total and projection quantum numbers @xmath65 and @xmath66 defined earlier .",

    "a gentle kick by a long range coulomb potential implies that the halo absorbs the transfered momentum as a whole , meaning that the adiabatic approximation should be adequate for this reaction type .",
    "we therefore as in @xcite replace the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath70 with a constant , namely the ground state energy @xmath71 of the halo .",
    "this ground state energy , typically a fraction of an mev , is much smaller than the total energy @xmath72 , typically of the order of hundred mev , and can therefore be neglected .",

    "in addition to the breakup amplitude we obtain the elastic scattering of the halo as a whole simply by substituting the ground state wave function @xmath93 instead of the continuum wave function in the transition matrix element in eq.([trans2 ] ) .",
    "this then leads to @xmath94    for a two - neutron halo the largest contribution to the three - by - one final state is given at large impact parameters by the long - range coulomb interaction between the charged core and the target . considering only this main contribution we can write the breakup cross - section ( with @xmath5 designating the core ) as @xmath95 where the spin of the core is 0 or 1/2 and",
    "@xmath96 is simply the rutherford projectile - target cross section .    when the two  body interactions between halo fragments in the final state are neglected in eq.([elascoul ] )",

    "this matrix element also included all the higher multipole transitions .",
    "they could in principle arise from the nuclear as well as the coulomb interaction .      when the participant is charged the elastic cross section eq.([elascoul ] ) for @xmath139",
    "is dominated by the coulomb cross section , which after integration over the directions of @xmath140 diverges like @xmath141 . since the square of the matrix element in eq.([elascoul ] ) vanishes as @xmath142 for small @xmath143 , the integration of eq.([elascoul ] ) over @xmath143 leads to a logarithmic divergence of this elastic cross section .",
    "however , to produce dissociation , the energy transferred from target to participant ( @xmath144 ) must be larger than the three  body binding energy @xmath145 . when @xmath146 and @xmath147 are parallel @xmath148 is maximized . for small @xmath145 compared to",
    "the target rest mass @xmath149 implies that @xmath150 , which reduces to @xmath151 in the non  relativistic limit . thus @xmath143 must be larger than @xmath152 to produce dissociation .",
    "another formal divergence arises for the coulomb interaction at large impact parameters ( low momentum transfer ) , where adiabatic motion only allows virtual excitations excluding dissociation . if the collision time @xmath153 is long compared to the orbital period of motion @xmath154 inside the projectile no transfer of energy occurs .",
    "these processes are excluded by the adiabatic cutoff .",
    "the decisive parameter is @xcite @xmath155 where @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 is the adiabatic cutoff energy , i.e. the maximum value of the equivalent photon energy for a given impact parameter @xmath159 estimated in a sharp cutoff model @xcite .",
    "then @xmath160 , where @xmath145 is the three - body binding energy , should be a reasonable estimate as the lowest energy needed for breakup . however , the softness of the electromagnetic excitation modes could influence this sharp cutoff value , but the effect on the cross sections is still only logarithmic .",
    "we leave the precise choice of @xmath158 for adjustments in the numerical computations .",
    "in previous publications @xcite we used @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the binding energy between participant and the system consisting of the two spectators , i.e. , @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the two  body binding energy of the two spectators . in a borromean system",
    "@xmath164 is negative .",
    "this is a misleading connection for a slow reaction where the full projectile is adiabatically excited .    from @xcite the following classical relation between the momentum transfer @xmath143 and the impact parameter @xmath159",
    "is derived : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the momentum of the projectile and @xmath167 its kinetic energy .",
    "the adiabatic cutoff condition @xmath168 and use of eqs.([times ] ) and ( [ adiab ] ) leads then to @xmath169 , where @xmath170 therefore integration of eq.([elascoul ] ) has to include only values of the momentum transfer @xmath143 larger than the largest of @xmath152 and @xmath171 .",
    "the divergence then disappears .",
    "the two different final state divisions described in section [ sec2 ] are introduced for physics reasons and not for convenience .",
    "the underlying idea is that dominating reaction contributions arise from ( optical model type of ) absorption , which implies that the final state consists of the spectators and the participant - target system , and elastic core - target coulomb scattering at low momentum transfer leading to a final state containing all three halo particles .",
    "this division is dictated by the reaction mechanism and seems to be unavoidable in a few - body treatment where the core degrees of freedom are neglected . furthermore , the finite extension of the projectile constituents and the target also requires a similar division according to the number of projectile constituents simultaneously colliding with the target .",
    "let us extend the applicability of the inert particle model and incorporate effects of the core degrees of freedom and the finite sizes of the constituents .",
    "first we assume short  range interactions between each of the halo constituents and the target",
    ". then we start by describing the individual constituent ",
    "target interaction in the black disk model , according to which the target absorbs the constituent inside a cylinder with the axis along the beam direction and otherwise leaves untouched .",
    "the radius of this cylinder is related to the range of the interaction and approximately equal to the sum of target and constituent radii .",
    "for the collision between the halo nucleus and the target we have then the four possibilities shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] :    * only one of the halo constituents , the participant , is inside its cylinder .",
    "the other two constituents are mere spectators , and survive untouched after the collision .",
    "the three constituents of the halo projectile give rise to three contributions of this kind . *",
    "two of the halo constituents are participants .",
    "the third one is spectator .",
    "again we have three possible reactions of this kind .",
    "* all the three halo constituents are inside their corresponding cylinders .",
    "* all the three halo constituents are outside their cylinders .",
    "for short  range interactions this means that the whole projectile is untouched by the target , and this process would only contribute to the elastic cross section .",
    "the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is only directly valid for short - range interactions and therefore not applicable for charged halos .",
    "this is a severe deficiency as even a two  neutron halo nucleus colliding with a heavy target involves a core - target coulomb interaction that by far can dominate the cross section .    to incorporate long  range interactions into the model we do the following : in the reactions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a , [ fig2]b , and [ fig2]c the participant ",
    "target interaction contains two parts , the full short  range interaction and the long  range potential related to small impact parameters ( large momentum transfer ) .",

    "they contain the nuclear core - target interaction and the large momentum transfer part of the coulomb core  target interaction .",
    "they are described in section 2.1 , and the integral of eq.([elas ] ) over the momentum transfer involves values of @xmath143 larger than a certain value @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "low momentum transfer contributions correspond to the process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d , where none of the halo constituents are inside their cylinders , and only the core - target coulomb interaction contributes .",
    "cross sections are obtained after integration of eq.([elascoul ] ) , where the momentum transfer varies between @xmath174 and @xmath172 .",

    "we also show in the figure the two  neutron removal cross section obtained only from the reactions in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a where one neutron and the core are spectators ( dot  dashed curve ) .",
    "in the central part we show the results for a cu target . due to the coulomb interaction the core participant contribution dominates at low beam energies , but decreases below that of the core spectator with increasing energy . for the @xmath0he projectile",
    "this crossing appears at a beam energy of around 600 mev / nucleon clearly larger than the 100 mev / nucleon for @xmath1li .",
    "therefore , for energies from 100 mev / nucleon to 600 mev / nucleon the main contribution to @xmath201 comes from core participant reactions for @xmath0he projectile and from core spectator reactions for @xmath1li projectile . in other words ,",
    "a cu target resembles a light target for the @xmath1li projectile and a heavy target for @xmath0he .",
    "this is due to the larger size of @xmath1li compared to the one of @xmath0he .",
    "the general behavior of @xmath201 for heavy targets is seen in the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the results for a pb target are shown . due to the large coulomb interaction",
    "the core participant contribution is clearly dominating , see the dot  dashed line corresponding to the reaction in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d , where only the large impact parameter part ( @xmath180 ) of the coulomb interaction is included .",
    "this contribution is for both projectiles very similar to the one coming from core participant ( dashed ) , that includes the full coulomb core  target interaction , the nuclear core  target interaction , and the interference between them .",
    "the contribution given by the neutron ",
    "target interaction ( core spectator , dotted ) is negligible at low beam energies for both projectiles , while at large beam energies it contributes around 15% of the total for @xmath0he and 35% of the total for @xmath1li .",
    "the agreement with the measured values is overall rather good considering the incompatibility of some of the data points .",
    "as mentioned at the end of the previous section , the adiabatic cutoff @xmath202 is chosen to be 0.15 mev for the @xmath1li projectile .",
    "the result of the expected logarithmic dependence on @xmath202 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the two - neutron removal cross section for the pb target where the effect is largest .",
    "the thin line shows the computed cross section with @xmath202= 0.3 mev .",
    "the agreement with the experimental points is only slightly worse . for the c target the minimum value of the momentum transfer",
    "is given by @xmath152 instead of @xmath171 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec23 ] ) , and for cu target @xmath152 becomes larger than @xmath171 for beam energies around 150 mev / nucleon when @xmath202 = 0.15 mev and around 400 mev when @xmath202 = 0.3 mev .",
    "therefore the choice of one value or the other for the adiabatic cutoff energy does not play any role for c target and insignificant for the cu target . for @xmath0he projectile we used @xmath202 = 1 mev , corresponding to its binding energy .",
    "a variation of this number within a reasonable range produces a smaller change than in the case of @xmath1li due to its smaller charge .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show core breakup cross sections after fragmentation of @xmath0he and @xmath1li on c ( left ) , cu ( middle ) and pb ( right ) . for the three targets we have plotted the contributions from the reactions in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , where the core is absorbed while the two neutrons are spectators ( long  dashed line ) , the contributions from the reactions in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b where only one of the halo neutrons is spectator ( dot  dashed curve ) , and the contribution from the reaction in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , where there are no spectators ( short  dashed line ) .    for a carbon target",
    "we see that for the @xmath1li projectile the contribution from the two  neutron spectators is dominant , and the contribution from simultaneous collisions with the target of more than one constituents is smaller , although still significant . for the @xmath0he projectile",
    "the situation is different , and the no spectators contribution is even larger than the two  neutron spectators contribution .",
    "this is a reflection of the difference in size between these projectiles . if we denote the neutron ",
    "core distance @xmath203 we obtain @xmath204 fm for @xmath0he and @xmath205 fm for @xmath1li . in @xmath0he",
    "the two halo neutrons are then closer to the core than in @xmath1li .",
    "thus , when the core is absorbed the two halo neutrons have a larger probability of being spectators for @xmath1li than for the @xmath0he projectile .    for a copper target",
    "the no spectators contribution is dominant for core destruction for both projectiles .",
    "changing from c to cu we increase the size of the targets , and therefore the probability for the halo neutrons being spectators decreases . again",
    "the smaller size of @xmath0he is responsible for the larger difference between the long  dashed and short  dashed curves compared to the case of @xmath1li projectile .",
    "the same behavior is observed for a pb target . as the target mass increases the probability for the two neutrons being spectators decreases .",
    "the dominant process for a heavy target is the one where all the three halo constituents interact with the target .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot interaction cross sections for the two projectiles and the three targets that we are considering .",
    "they are cross sections corresponding to processes where the projectile undergoes some reaction , and they are given by the sum of the two  neutron removal and core breakup cross sections .",
    "as a general rule @xmath206 is larger than @xmath201 , and only for low beam energies and heavy targets @xmath201 dominates due to the large distance coulomb collisions maintaining the core intact .",
    "again , for @xmath1li on pb the computed interaction and two - neutron removal cross sections differ somewhat when the adiabatic cutoff energy @xmath202 is increased from 0.15 mev to 0.30 mev .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is good , except for the low beam energy point for the @xmath1li projectile .",
    "however , this experimental point should be taken with caution , since the @xmath201 values for c and pb targets are not consistent with the data for @xmath1li on beryllium or gold , for which the experimental values of @xmath201 at 30 mev / nucleon are @xmath207 b and @xmath208 b , respectively @xcite .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab3 ] the values of the cutoff parameters @xmath197 are not uniquely determined . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we examine the dependence of the interaction and two  neutron removal cross sections on these parameters . for a carbon target the main uncertainty appears in the case of a neutron spectator , where the value of @xmath209 can vary between 2.6 fm and 3.9 fm .",
    "we used 3.5 fm in the previous calculations .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare the cross sections with @xmath209=2.5 fm and 3.5 fm , while we maintain 4.0 fm and 4.8 fm for @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "the difference between these two calculations is very small . for cu and",
    "pb targets the largest range of variation for the cutoff parameters is for the core spectator . in the calculations shown up to now",
    "we have chosen the value obtained with procedure c ) , but procedures a ) and b ) can give significantly larger values for these parameters , see table  [ tab3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we also compare @xmath212 and @xmath201 obtained with @xmath213 5.7  fm and 7.0  fm and @xmath214 6.1  fm and 8.0  fm for a cu target , and @xmath215 7.6  fm and 10.0  fm and @xmath216 7.9  fm and 10.0  fm for a pb target .",
    "it is then striking that even when the difference between the parameters is substantial , the difference between the computed cross sections is rather insignificant .",
    "the main reason is that for these two targets an important contribution comes from the large impact parameter part of the coulomb contribution ( the reaction in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) , where the cutoff parameters are unimportant .",
    "this is especially true for the lead target with the large coulomb interaction .    the main conclusion obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is that the value chosen for the cutoff parameters within the range shown in table  [ tab3 ] is not substantially modifying the cross sections .",
    "we may view these parameters as relevant for fine tune , while the cross section sizes and general behavior are maintained .      in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the longitudinal and transverse core momentum distributions after fragmentation of @xmath0he and @xmath1li on on c , cu and pb . the calculations have been done at a beam energy of 300 mev / nucleon . for this energy",
    "the difference between longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions is small .",
    "the transverse distributions are in general wider than the longitudinal , typically by 6 to 12 mev / c .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite for @xmath0he on c , and they are obtained at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon and 240 mev / nucleon , respectively . for @xmath1li on c",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite and they have been obtained with a beam energy of 280 mev / nucleon . for @xmath1li on",
    "pb the data are from @xcite and they correspond to a beam energy of 280 mev / nucleon . within this range of energies",
    "the difference in shape between the computed distributions is not visible . in all the cases",
    "the experimental data are given in arbitrary units , and they have been scaled to the calculations .",
    "the agreement between them and the calculations is good .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the short  dashed line shows the contribution from core participant . for light targets the dominating processes are those where the core is not participant , and",
    "therefore its final momentum is similar to the one that it had inside the halo projectile ( except for the final neutron ",
    "core interaction , that does not modify significantly the core momentum @xcite ) . when the target size increases",
    "the weight of the core participant contribution becomes more important . for pb",
    "this contribution is very close to the total .",
    "the dominating process is then the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d , where only the low momentum transfer part of the coulomb interaction should be included .",
    "the momentum transferred to the core in the collision is small compared to its initial momentum distribution , which therefore for a entirely different reason again is left relatively unchanged .",
    "although in this case the three ",
    "body continuum wave function should be used , only the final neutron ",
    "neutron interaction has been included .",
    "nevertheless , due to its large mass , core momentum distributions are not expected to be strongly modified by the final state interaction @xcite .",
    "the consequence is that the shape of the core momentum distributions is almost independent of the target .",
    "only the initial core momentum distribution within the projectile is decisive .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show longitudinal and transverse neutron momentum distributions after two  neutron removal fragmentation of @xmath0he and @xmath1li on c , cu and pb . the calculations have been performed at a beam energy of 300 mev / nucleon .",
    "the difference between longitudinal and transverse distributions is very small .",
    "usually the computed transverse distributions are from 2 to 4 mev / c wider , and the difference between them is hardly visible .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the short  dashed curve shows the contribution from core  participant processes .",
    "the behavior is similar to the one found in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for light targets",
    "the core spectator contribution is dominating , while for heavy targets the main contribution comes from processes where the core participates .",
    "the only available experimental neutron momentum distribution is for @xmath0he on c @xcite obtained at a beam energy of 240 mev / nucleon .",
    "the agreement with the experiment is excellent , and only in the tails the computed curve is above the experimental distribution .",
    "this is due to the experimental neutron acceptance , that is limited in horizontal and vertical directions to a momentum of 50 mev / c .    for a lead target",
    "the neutron momentum distribution is dominated by core participant processes , and in particular by processes where the momentum transferred to the core is small .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec2 ] , the final state is properly described for relatively small impact parameters by the reaction scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for heavy targets",
    "the reaction is dominated by processes where mainly the low momentum transfer part of the coulomb interaction contributes .",
    "the breakup process is then relatively gentle , and the three  body continuum wave function should be used to describe the final state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] . therefore eqs.([trans2 ] ) and ( [ elascoul ] ) should then be used to describe these processes .",
    "it is well known that neutron momentum distributions are highly influenced by the final state interaction between fragments , while this influence is less important for core momentum distributions @xcite due to the larger mass . in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we computed all distributions using the reaction scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and therefore for the case of pb target , where the final three  body continuum wave function should be used , only the final neutron - neutron interaction is included . as mentioned this has only a small influence on the core momentum distributions , where the agreement with the experiment shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is satisfactory .",
    "however , the computed neutron momentum distributions after fragmentation on a heavy target like pb shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] are expected to be too broad compared to the experimental data due to the neglect of the final state interaction between the neutron and the core for the dominating process .",
    "these computed results , including the neutron - neutron final state interaction , are still much more realistic than the fourier transform of the initial wave function implying that all final state interactions are neglected .    for completeness",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] four other interesting observables obtained after fragmentation of @xmath0he and @xmath1li . as discussed above , inclusion of all the final state interactions",
    "is required for heavy targets corresponding to reaction scheme fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "thus we focus here only on a c target .",
    "similar observables for the @xmath1li projectile are already published in @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed for a beam energy of 300 mev / nucleon , and the experimental data in figs .",
    "[ fig9]a and [ fig9]b from @xcite and in fig .",
    "[ fig9]c from @xcite are given in arbitrary units for a beam energy of 240 mev / nucleon .",
    "the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig9]d from @xcite are also given in arbitrary units for a beam energy of 287 mev / nucleon . in ref.@xcite , where angular distributions for @xmath0he projectile are shown ,",
    "we inadvertently used a wrong relative phase between interfering two - body final states .",
    "the conclusions in @xcite still hold but the numerical results now compare slightly better with measured values .",
    "the calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] are in agreement with the experiments , except for the angular distribution in fig .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is due to the approximation of spheres instead of the proper cylinder geometries shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig1a ] .",
    "the exceptional sensitivity arises in this case , because the dependence on @xmath217 of the components with neutron - core relative @xmath166-wave angular momentum projection @xmath218 are very flat while the @xmath219 component is strongly varying @xcite . unlike the other quantities the proper cutoff symmetry is then decisive for this particular observable .",
    "the cylinder would remove relatively more of the @xmath219 component of the neutron - core @xmath166-wave and the computation would approach the measured distribution .",
    "the angular distributions are very different for @xmath0he and @xmath1li projectiles as seen by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig9]c and [ fig9]d .",
    "the large average value for @xmath220li reflects the dominating constant contribution from neutron - core relative @xmath221-waves and the asymmetric variation is due to the interference of @xmath221 and @xmath166-waves .",
    "the strong dependence on the proper cutoff of the different angular momentum projection states is then not present .",
    "it is especially interesting that the angular distribution for @xmath220li in fig .",
    "[ fig9]d agrees so well since these computations were performed before the measurements were available .",
    "in this paper we formulate a model to describe fragmentation reactions of two  neutron halo nuclei on any nuclear target , from light to heavy .",
    "it is well established that nuclear and coulomb interactions dominate for light and heavy targets , respectively . thus both must be incorporated in a comprehensive description which also should include intermediate target masses .",
    "we confine ourselves to relatively high energies where the reaction time can be expected to be short compared to the time scale of the intrinsic halo motion .",
    "the structure computations proceed in two steps , i.e. few - body models are used to describe the halo degrees of freedom and then the effects of the intrinsic structure of the halo constituents are considered .",
    "we adopt the same two - step strategy and start with a reaction model for weakly bound inert halo particles . due to the spatial extension of the initial three - body system the dominating processes for short - range interactions are independent reactions of each halo particle ( participant ) with the target as for free particles .",
    "the participant is then elastically scattered or `` something else '' called absorption happens while the other two halo particles ( spectators ) continue undisturbed under the influence of their mutual interaction .",
    "we use the optical model to describe the participant - target interaction .",
    "elastic scattering is then described in details while different processes are considered as absorption which means that all other channels only remove probability and otherwise forgotten .",
    "however , this is the essence of the information in breakup experiments where the forward fragmentation products are measured .",
    "furthermore , absorption in this optical model sense accounts for intrinsic degrees of freedom related to the target and the halo constituents .",
    "this is in other words consistent with the use of a three - body model for the halo structure .",
    "going beyond this approximation in the reaction description requires at least as accurate a treatment of core degrees of freedom of the initial state .",
    "another crucial ingredient to understand the reaction mechanisms is the finite sizes of both halo constituents and target .",
    "conceptually this is related to the necessity both of accounting for intrinsic degrees of freedom and for describing more than one simultaneous halo particle interaction with the target .",
    "this becomes clear in the impact parameter picture where more than one particle at the same time may arrive at the target position within the interaction cylinder .",
    "we characterize the different processes of absorption and/or elastic scattering of the different halo particles that simultaneously interact with the target . for one of them ( the core if possible )",
    "we employ optical potentials , and for the other(s ) we use the part of the three ",
    "body wave function where this constituent is close enough to the first one such that it can be considered to be inside its cylinder .",
    "the model provides absolute cross sections for all different processes .",
    "so far we discussed the short - range parts of the interactions . in the impact parameter picture",
    "we may more conveniently formulate this as a restriction to relatively large momentum transfer to the participant .",
    "then the reaction mechanism is basically independent halo particle reactions dictating the division into two independent two - body final state systems ( spectators and participant - target ) and in our formulation resulting in the participant - spectator model .",
    "this division is not for convenience of computation but to include the proper physics .    the large impact parameters or equivalently the small momentum transfers are important for long - range interactions . for nuclear halos",
    "this means the coulomb interaction which is active when the charged core is a participant .",
    "when the target is heavy with a high charge this gives rise to the main contribution to the breakup cross sections arising from very distant collisions .",
    "the momentum transfer to the core then excites low lying states of the halo which for borromean systems imply the low lying continuum states .",
    "these collisions are gentle and none of the halo particles are absorbed .",
    "consequently the final state must consist of the three - body halo system and an independent target .",
    "the model distinguishes for these reasons between small and large momentum transfer and allows therefore simultaneous treatment of nuclear and coulomb interactions including interference terms .",
    "we use the model to investigate fragmentation reactions of @xmath0he and @xmath1li on different targets , light as carbon , intermediate as copper , and heavy as lead .",
    "total interaction , two  neutron removal and core breakup cross sections are computed as function of beam energy and found to be in good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "we compute not only the terms arising from the dominating reaction mechanism , but also the parts usually neglected : coulomb contribution for light targets and nuclear contribution for heavy targets .",
    "reaction cross sections with targets of intermediate mass and charge , where nuclear and coulomb interaction interfere and give comparable contributions , are also calculated .",
    "the model parameters are obtained from independent sources like nuclear radii , binding energies and two - body scattering experiments .    the cross sections for reaching the different final states consisting of the non - absorbed particles vary with target , projectile and beam energy .",
    "for light targets two neutrons and no core is most probable while all three halo particles or the core alone is least probable",
    ". for heavy targets absorption of all three particles is most probable except at low beam energies where simultaneous survival of all three halo particles is most probable .",
    "the smallest probability is found for core survival alone or the core with one neutron .",
    "core destruction is more probable than two - neutron removal for all energies and targets .",
    "core destruction receives the largest contribution for heavy targets when all halo particles are absorbed while for light targets the two - neutron spectator contribution is comparable in size .",
    "two - neutron removal receives for heavy targets the largest contributions from core participation while for light targets the largest contribution arises from the core as a spectator .",
    "the relative sizes of all these cross sections reflect the reaction mechanisms which in this way are open for experimental tests .",
    "we have also computed core and neutron momentum distributions after fragmentation .",
    "this is a strong test of validity of the model , since total values obtained after integration could be in good agreement with experiments even when the non - integrated differential cross sections differ from measurements .",
    "it is known that final state interactions play an essential role in the momentum distributions , especially for light particles as neutrons .",
    "for light targets the dominant reactions are the ones with one or two spectators , and the model accounts properly for the final state interaction between spectators . the neutron momentum distribution receives a narrow contribution from one - neutron absorption and a broader contribution from neutron participation and subsequent scattering . the agreement with the available",
    "experimental core and neutron momentum distributions is excellent for both projectiles .    for heavy targets the low momentum transfer reaction dominates , and the appropriate reaction mechanism involves the low lying three - body continuum excitations in the final state .",
    "this implies that all three initial three - body interactions are necessary in the final state . in the numerical examples we only included two at a time . for core momentum distributions , where the final state interactions are expected to be less relevant , we still obtain good agreement with the experiment . for neutron momentum distributions",
    "we include the neutron - neutron interaction but not the neutron - core interaction . the distributions are therefore expected to be somewhat too broad .",
    "the model predicts comparable shapes for core and neutron momentum distributions for light and heavy targets although the reaction mechanisms are very different . for light targets one - neutron absorption",
    "is the dominating process leaving the other neutron and the core untouched in the final state under their mutual interaction . for heavy targets the dominating process is a distant collision of low momentum transfer to the core leaving the two neutrons untouched and the core with a momentum very close to its initial value .",
    "still the three particles are influenced by the final state interactions . in both cases the core and the neutrons would appear basically with their initial momentum distributions modified by final state interactions .",
    "this is not tested in details , but still in qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "the model describes a number of different reaction mechanisms and provides the appropriate relative weights for the corresponding processes . the same consistent model with one set of parameters is used throughout for all observables .",
    "in this paper the model is tested in details by comprehensive calculations for the most studied two - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "this includes absolute values of the differential cross sections as functions of beam energy and target . dominating contributions to many relative distributions",
    "can sometimes be explained by simpler models since they are surface or tail dominated",
    ". however , the intrinsic degrees of freedom are necessary to obtain reliable absolute values , especially for less dominating processes . the details are unnecessary for breakup reactions as long as predictable total removal probabilities can be obtained as provided by the phenomenological optical model ."
