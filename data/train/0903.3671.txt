    "in the last decade there has been a renewed interest related to the research of thermal transport in one - dimensional magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have been motivated by unusual high values of thermal conductance of some materials , as for example reported in ref . .",
    "from the theoretical side , several works calculating and discussing thermal conductivity in different model hamiltonians have also appeared @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , spin hamiltonians provide the natural scenario to implement quantum computation .",
    "this motivated interesting proposals of a variety of physical systems , like arrays of quantum dots , optical lattices and nuclear magnetic resonace experiments which are architectured to effectively behave like one - dimensional spin systems .",
    "@xcite    most of the theoretical studies on heat transport in spin systems are performed within the linear response regime , assuming a very small temperature gradient @xmath1 , and using a kubo formula .",
    "altough this formula is widely used in calculating thermal transport properties it has several conceptual difficulties , particularly if @xmath1 is not small @xcite .",
    "the thermal averaging assumes a constant temperature , and ( as in all kubo formulas ) , the time dependence is governed by the total hamiltonian @xmath2 , including the perturbation @xmath3 , while the thermodynamic averaging is done with @xmath4 , assuming a fast evolution . for finite @xmath1",
    "the separation of @xmath5 into an unperturbed part @xmath4 and a perturbation @xmath6 is in principle ambiguous . on the other hand ,",
    "real experiments are performed by coupling the system under study to macroscopic systems with well defined temperatures that act as reservoirs .",
    "therefore , it seems desirable to develop alternative approaches designed to treat systems out of equilibrium .",
    "important progress has been achieved by studying the properties of non - equilibrium steady states of xx and xy chains within an algebraic setting which allows one to obtain explicit analytical expressions for different quantities such as entropy production @xcite .",
    "recently , the usefulness of kubo formula for the investigation of heat transport in quantum systems has been discussed @xcite and the investigation of energy transport through spin systems beyond kubo formula has been addressed on the basis of master equations and quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , it is not clear how to extend these ideas to more general situations . in this work",
    "we address the problem of thermal transport in one dimensional magnetic systems from a different perspective .",
    "we study a problem that to the best of our knowledge has not been considered yet .",
    "we study the heat flow through a _",
    "spin chain heterostructure _ , which we generically define as a set of finite or semi - infinite spin chains attached by their ends .",
    "each piece of the heterostructure can be in principle described by a _",
    "different _ hamiltonian . for definiteness",
    ", we shall consider in this work a finite central system connected to two ( left and right ) semi - infinite chains , with a _ _  finite _ _ temperature difference between them@xcite .",
    "this problem is the thermal analog of electronic transport through mesoscopic structures , nanodevices or molecules connected to conducting leads with a finite applied bias voltage , a subject of intense research in recent years .",
    "in fact , this type of set - up is the common situation found in the study of charge transport in electronic systems , where a central system is connected to charge reservoirs that also act as thermal baths .",
    "this is the basis of the `` landauer '' approach , which is one of the most common frameworks to study transport properties of meso- and nano- devices in the last years .",
    "@xcite    in addition , as it is well known , one - dimensional spin @xmath0 systems can be mapped , via the jordan - wigner transformation to fermionic systems .",
    "thus , the model under investigation is equivalent to an electronic heterostructure where very well established techniques , as the schwinger - keldysh non equilibrium green s functions method can be applied @xcite .",
    "we focus on a simple device where the central and right parts of the system can be described by xx spin 1/2 chains , and the left part corresponds to an anisotropic xy chain .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation maps these models into bilinear fermionic systems , rendering the theoretical study simpler .",
    "we show that this simple device presents an interesting physical effect : due to a mechanism reminiscent of andreev reflections in superconductors , this device could act as thermal diode",
    ". this rectifying effect might be useful for applications .",
    "we argue that this is a generic feature , which remains valid for anisotropic xyz models .",

    "the consequence is an asymmetry in the behavior of the transmission functions under the change @xmath173 .",
    "the result is an effect of thermal rectification .",
    "that is , the magnitude of the current @xmath123 when ( @xmath177,@xmath178 ) and ( @xmath179,@xmath180 ) is different to @xmath181 when ( @xmath182,@xmath183 ) and ( @xmath140,@xmath184 ) , which means that the device is more likely to conduct heat when the temperature difference is applied in one direction than in the other .",
    "we display the phenomena for two different values of @xmath167 .",
    "we show the current when ( @xmath185 ) with dots and the current when ( @xmath186 ) with a full line .",
    "when the value of @xmath187 both currents are rather large and similar but when @xmath188 the currents are smaller and clearly different .",
    "we have presented a theoretical framework to study heat transport in one - dimensional spin heterostructures .    in the present work we have focussed on a simple system composed of a junction between an anisotropic ( xy ) and an isotropic ( xx ) chain under the effect of an inhomogeneous magnetic field along the @xmath18 direction . using the jordan - wigner transformation to map the problem into a fermionic system and using the non equilibrium keldysh - schwinger formalism",
    "we have obtained exact expression for the heat current in terms of green s functions of the `` disconnected '' spin chain components .",
    "the resulting expressions can be evaluated numerically in a simple way . in the limits @xmath189 and @xmath190 explicit analytic expressions",
    "can also be given .",
    "we have studied the heat transport as a function of the different parameters of the model and we have shown that when different magnetic fields are applied at the end chains , a rectifying effect in the heat current occurs .",
    "this effect might be of interest for applications .",
    "its origin can be traced back to the appearance of paring terms induced by the anisotropy parameter , which are in turn responsible for an andreev reflection type mechanism .    in this work",
    "we have analyzed a simple model . however",
    "this methodology can be straightforwardly extended to more complex structures with many junctions and disorder .",
    "our treatment relies on the jordan - wigner transformation which maps the original spin hamiltonians into fermionic ones . in the case",
    "we have considered , the latter are bilinear . in more generic models , although we expect the rectifying effect still to be present , the technical analysis could be more complicated .",
    "for instance , in the isotropic heisenberg model , which in addition to the exchange interaction along @xmath191 and @xmath15 directions , contains an additional exchange term along the @xmath18 direction , the jordan - wigner transformation translates such a term into a many - body fermionic interaction , which does not enable a straightforward analytical solution of the problem , as in the case we considered here .",
    "nevertheless , the green s function formalism offers a framework for the construction of systematic approximations to treat those terms .",
    "numerical methods could also be useful to deal with models containing many - body terms .",
    "@xcite as in electronic systems , many - body terms are expected to introduce further inelastic scattering processes , which could add further ingredients in addition to the transport mechanisms we have discussed here .",
    "we hope to report on some of these issues in future work .",
    "this investigation was sponsored by pip 5254 and pip 112 - 200801 - 00466 of conicet , pict 2006/483 of the anpcyt and projects x123 and x403 from uba .",

    "the first two green s functions give the corresponding result for the normal chain @xmath197 and @xmath198 respectively .",
    "the green s functions of the open chain can be solved considering a ring of @xmath199 sites , periodic except for the fact that the energy at one site ( which we label as site 0 ) is increased by an energy @xmath200 , and then taking the limit @xmath201 .",

    "both results of course coincide , but the latter method involves a simpler algebra .",
    "we define a matrix @xmath204 with the green s functions for @xmath205 , and a corresponding matrix @xmath206 for @xmath207 .",
