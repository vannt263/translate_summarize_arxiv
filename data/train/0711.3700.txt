    "there is a significant complication in designing swimmers at small scale as they have to undergo non - reciprocal deformations to break the time - reversal symmetry and achieve propulsion at low reynolds number @xcite . while it is not so difficult to imagine constructing motion cycles with the desired property when we have a large number of degrees of freedom at hand ",
    "like nature does , for example  this will prove nontrivial when we want to design something with only a few degrees of freedom and strike a balance between simplicity and functionality , like most human - engineered devices @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an increased interest in such designs @xcite and an interesting example of such robotic micro - swimmers has been realized experimentally using magnetic colloids attached by dna - linkers @xcite .",
    "while constructing small swimmers that generate surface distortions is a natural choice , it is also possible to take advantage of the general class of phoretic phenomena to achieve locomotion , as they become predominant at small scales @xcite .",
    "here we consider a recently introduced model for a simple low reynolds number swimmer that is made of three linked spheres @xcite , and present a detailed analysis of it motion . unlike the purcell swimmer @xcite that is difficult to analyze",
    "because it takes advantage of the rotational degrees of freedom of finite rods that move near each other @xcite , the three - sphere swimmer model is amenable to analytical analysis as it involves the translational degrees of freedom in one dimension only , which simplifies the tensorial structure of the fluid motion .",
    "we present closed form expressions for the swimming velocity with arbitrary swimming deformation cycles , and also use a perturbation scheme to simplify the results so that the study can be taken further .",
    "we examine various mechanical aspects of the motion including the pattern of the internal forces during the swimming , the force  velocity response of the swimmer due to external loads , the power consumption rate , and the hydrodynamic efficiency of the swimmer .",
    "finally , we consider the role of the phase difference between the motion of the two parts of the swimmer and propose a mechanism to build in a constant ( coherent ) phase difference in a system that is triggered from the outside .",
    "we also discuss the effect of noise on the swimming velocity of the model system .",
    "we also note that the three - sphere low reynolds swimmer has been recently generalized to the case of a swimmer with a macroscopic cargo container @xcite , and a swimmer whose deformations are driven by stochastic random configurational transitions @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "appendix [ app : v - full ] contains the closed form expression for the swimming velocity of the general asymmetric swimmer , which is the basis of some of the results discussed in the paper .",
    "we begin with a simplified model geometry which consists of three spheres of radii @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) that are separated by two arms of lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3ss - schem ] .",
    "each sphere exerts a force @xmath4 on ( and experiences a force @xmath5 from ) the fluid that we assume to be along the swimmer axis . in the limit @xmath6",

    "the swimming velocity of the whole object is the mean translational velocity , namely @xmath8 we are seeking to study autonomous net swimming , which requires the whole system to be force - free ( i.e. there are no external forces acting on the spheres ) .",
    "this means that the above equations are subject to the constraint @xmath9 eliminating @xmath10 using eq .",

    "we choose to prescribe the motion of the arms connecting the three spheres , and assume that the velocities @xmath13 are known functions .",
    "we then use eqs .",
    "( [ v1-fi ] ) , ( [ v2-fi ] ) , ( [ v3-fi ] ) , and ( [ force - free - def ] ) to solve for @xmath14 and @xmath15 as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "equation [ eq : v0-a - eq - large - amp ] is also valid for arbitrarily large deformations .",
    "we can also consider relatively small deformations and perform an expansion of the swimming velocity to the leading order .",

    "note that terms proportional to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are eliminated because they are full time derivatives and they average out to zero in a cycle . equation ( [ v - bar-1 ] ) clearly shows that the average swimming velocity is proportional to the enclosed area that is swept in a full cycle in the configuration space [ i.e. in the @xmath28 space ] .",
    "this result , which is valid within the perturbation theory , is inherently related to the geometrical structure of theory the low reynolds number swimming studied by shapere and wilczek @xcite .",
    "naturally , the swimmer can achieve higher velocities if it can maximize this area by introducing sufficient phase difference between the two deformation cycles ( see below ) .",
    "we also note that the above result is more general than what was previously considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which corresponded to the class of configurational changes that happen one at a time , i.e. spanning rectangular areas in the configuration space @xcite .",
    "we can actually obtain eq .",
    "( [ v - bar-1 ] ) from a rather general argument . since the deformation of the arms is prescribed , the instantaneous net displacement velocity of the swimmer should take on a series expansion form of @xmath29 where the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , _ etc .",
    "_ are purely geometrical prefactors ( _ i.e. _ involving only the length scales @xmath0 s and @xmath33 s )",
    ". terms of higher order than one in velocity will have to be excluded on the grounds that in stokes hydrodynamics forces are linearly dependent on ( prescribed ) velocities , and then the velocity any where else is also linearly proportional to the forces , which renders an overall linear dependency of the swimming velocity on set velocities .",
    "moreover , higher order terms in velocity would require a time scale such as the period of the motion to balance the dimensions , which is not a quantity that is known to the system at any instant ( i.e. would require nonlocal effects ) . since the motion is periodic and",
    "we should average over one complete cycle to find the net swimming velocity , we can note that the only combination that survives the averaging process up to the second order is @xmath34 , which yields eq .",
    "( [ v - bar-1 ] ) .",
    "note that this argument works even if the spheres have finite large radii that are not small comparable to the average length of the arms .",
    "it is instructive at this point to examine a few explicit examples of swimming cycles for the three - sphere swimmer .",
    "let us consider harmonic deformations for the two arms , with identical frequencies @xmath35 and a mismatch in phases , namely @xmath36 the average swimming velocity from eq .",
    "( [ v - bar-1 ] ) reads @xmath37 this result shows that the maximum velocity is obtained when the phase difference is @xmath38 , which supports the picture of maximizing the area covered by the trajectory of the swimming cycle in the parameter space of the deformations .",
    "a phase difference of @xmath12 or @xmath39 , for example , will create closed trajectories with zero area , or just lines .",
    "thinking about practical aspects of implementing such swimming strokes in real systems , it might appear difficult to incorporate a phase difference in the motion of the two parts of a swimmer .",
    "in particular , for small scale swimmers we would not have direct mechanical access to the different parts of the system and the deformations would be more easily triggered externally by some kind of generic interaction with the system , such as shining laser pulses . in this case , we need to incorporate a net phase difference in the response of the two parts of the system to simultaneous triggers .",
    "this can be achieved if the two parts of the system have different relaxation times . to illustrate this , imagine that the arms of the swimmer could switch their lengths via exponential relaxation between two values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 back and forth as a switch is turned on and off .",
    "the deformation can be written as @xmath42 , & \\ ; 0<t<\\frac{t}{2 } ,   \\\\ \\\\ d_i",

    ", the phase mismatch is materialized in the difference in the relaxation times , despite the fact that the deformations are switched on and off simultaneously .",
    "another important issue in practical situations is the inevitability of random or stochastic behavior of the deformations . in small scales ,",
    "brownian agitations of the environment become a significant issue , and we would like to know how feasible it is to extract a net coordinated swimming motion from a set of two noisy deformation patterns . using the fourier transform of the deformations ( @xmath43 ) @xmath53 we can calculate the time - averaged swimming velocity of eq .",
