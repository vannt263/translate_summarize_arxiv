    "it is well - established that a supernova remnant ( snr ) can accelerate particles to energies @xmath6 ev , probably through diffusive acceleration [ 1 - 3 ] by shocks between the snr blast shell and the interstellar medium . in particular perpendicular shocks ,",
    "for which the ambient magnetic field vector is orthogonal to the shock normal , are likely to be efficient particle ( i.e. electron or proton ) fermi accelerators @xcite .",
    "diffusive acceleration across perpendicular shocks requires that the particle gyroradius exceeds the shock thickness . in the case of the electrons , suprathermal populations with energies in excess of 100 kev @xcite",
    "must be present to start with the acceleration .",
    "this is the so - called injection problem. the injection of electrons is probably achieved by waves in the foreshock and by the shock precursors [ 6 - 13 ] .",
    "shocks are sources of ion beams , which originate from upstream ions that have been reflected by the shock or from downstream ions that leaked through the shock @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of beam - driven waves depends on the beam speed @xmath7 in the upstream plasma .",
    "the typical values of @xmath8 are comparable to the shock speed @xmath9 , which is @xmath10 for most solar system plasmas .",
    "the corresponding @xmath8 imply the growth of quasi - planar waves by buneman instabilities , either if no magnetic field @xmath11 is present or if @xmath12 .",
    "the buneman instability is modified if @xmath13 and upper - hybrid waves grow if @xmath14 . both waves",
    "saturate by forming electron phase space holes [ 16 - 19 ] .",
    "upper - hybrid waves accelerate further the trapped electrons by their transport across the magnetic field , by which they form high - dimensional phase space structures @xcite .",
    "higher shock speeds of @xmath15 exist at some snrs and at gamma ray bursts @xcite and ion beams moving at such speeds give rise to filamentation- and mixed mode instabilities [ 23 - 27 ] .",
    "both modes saturate by forming current channels , which thermalize the plasma by their mergers .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the instability and the interaction of the waves with the particles depends on whether it is the buneman instability , the quasi - electrostatic upper - hybrid instability or the mixed mode and filamentation instabilities with their electromagnetic component .",
    "the type of the instability thus determines the electron acceleration and injection efficiency .",
    "shock speeds of @xmath16 , which are associated with the fastest supernova - driven bulk flows @xcite , are between both extremes and it is not a priory known which instabilities are driven by ion beams with @xmath17 .",
    "wave instabilities driven by such beams have been examined with one - dimensional pic simulations @xcite and two - dimensional ones @xcite with periodic boundary conditions , which limits the resolved wave spectrum and neglects the effects introduced by the beam front . the higher - dimensional wave spectrum driven by plasma beams with @xmath18 , with a finite beam length and with a perpendicular magnetic field has remained practically unexplored , in spite of the importance of such a system for the electron injection at snr shocks . here",
    "we perform two simulation case studies that address such a system and we compare their results .",
    "we perform 2(1/2)d pic simulations of colliding plasma clouds in the @xmath19 plane , which evolve in time the three - dimensional particle momenta and electromagnetic field vectors .",
    "snr shocks are typically magnetized and the ratio between the electron plasma frequency and the electron cyclotron frequency may be a few ten to hundred .",
    "plasma processes close to the front of snr blast shells can amplify the magnetic field in the upstream to give a lower ratio @xcite .",
    "an uniform magnetic field along the z - direction is introduced as an initial condition .",
    "its strength gives a frequency ratio of 5 .",
    "this low value allows us to examine with pic simulations the magnetic field effects @xcite .",
    "both colliding plasma clouds have the same density in one simulation , which gives a symmetric collision .",
    "a density ratio of 2 is employed in the second simulation .",
    "the spectrum of unstable waves is a function of the relative beam density and we can examine how robust the wave spectrum is against changes in it .",
    "the speed , with which both clouds collide along the @xmath20-direction , is set to @xmath21 and the ion beam instabilities developing out of the collision have a @xmath22 . the electrons are heated and reach peak values of 20 kev in the cloud overlap region , which expands in time due to the ion motion .",
    "this value is in line with the results of previous pic simulations of spatially homogeneous beam instabilities in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that the dominant wave structures are quasi - planar .",
    "two - dimensional electromagnetic field structures develop well behind the ion beam front .",
    "they fluctuate and they have a lower amplitude than the planar electrostatic fields .",
    "some structuring orthogonal to the flow velocity vector is observed in an interval close to the ion beam front , but the electric field amplitudes remain below those of the planar electrostatic fields .",
    "non - planar structures may , however , form on larger scales @xcite .",
    "this planarity of the wave structures demonstrates that previous 1d pic simulations @xcite should be adequate for the modelling of snr shocks with @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetic field is compressed in the overlap region of both plasma clouds .",
    "the magnetic field amplitude doubles and it is constant in the overlap region , if both clouds are equally dense .",

    "the electrons have been thermalized for @xmath168 and @xmath160 and a beam exists at @xmath169 .",
    "only the ions of the dense beam in ( b ) are significantly accelerated.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this work we have examined with particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations the collision of two magnetized plasma clouds .",
    "plasma instabilities form in the layer , in which both clouds overlap . after a short transient phase",
    "the plasma thermalization is accomplished by an ion beam moving through a cool electron plasma .",
    "the cool electron plasma is from that cloud that has not yet interacted with the second cloud .",
    "the electrons of the second cloud have been heated .",
    "they are confined by the perpendicular magnetic field to the layer , in which both clouds overlap .",
    "this layer expands .",
    "one ion beam - driven instability develops at each of the two fronts of the overlap layer .",
    "the plasma clouds have been equally dense in one simulation , which is typically assumed by pic simulations of kinetic shocks that employ the piston method @xcite .",
    "the piston method models one plasma cloud , which it reflects at one simulation boundary onto itself .",
    "two clouds are modelled here and we get two instabilities with equally dense ion beams , one at each front of the expanding overlap layer .",
    "the ion beam density is comparable to that of the electron beam , which is the equivalent of the buneman instability in magnetized plasma .",
    "the density ratio has been set to 2 in the second simulation , which gives one instability driven by a dense ion beam and one driven by a tenuous ion beam .",
    "we could thus assess the impact of the ion beam density on the plasma dynamics for three cases using two simulations .",
    "the simulation parameters are probably relevant for the foreshock regions of the fastest perpendicular shocks at supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the normalization of the maxwell - lorentz set of equations makes the results independent of the value of the plasma frequency in physical units .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field resulted in a ratio of 5 between the electron plasma frequency of the dense cloud and the electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "the equivalent value close to snr shocks is thought to be several hundred .",
    "however , a substantial decrease of this ratio to about 10 might occur at some snr shocks @xcite .",
    "shock - accelerated particles can also amplify the magnetic field locally @xcite .",
    "we have selected a ratio of 5 , because it allows us to resolve magnetic field effects such as the electron surfing acceleration @xcite .",
    "some upstream ions are reflected by the shock [ 6 - 10 ] and they gyrate in the foreshock , which is a scenario analogous to that we have modelled here .",
    "the ion beam speed can reach twice the shock speed in the upstream frame of reference , if the reflection is specular .",
    "our ion beam speed in the reference frame of the electron beam is 0.1 c , which can be achieved with realistic snr shock speeds @xcite .",
    "it is between the low speeds , for which electrostatic instabilities dominate , and the fast speeds that favor mixed- or filamentation modes @xcite .",
    "our simulations here have shown that the wave structures are quasi - planar and the electrostatic instabilities thus dominate .",
    "the emergence of filamentary structures indicates , however , that this speed is probably the most extreme case in this respect , at least for our plasma parameters .",
    "we have introduced a second spatial dimension and an ion beam with a finite length .",
    "this has left unchanged the findings of previous one - dimensional pic simulations of spatially uniform beam distributions with respect to the acceleration of electrons .",
    "the peak speed of the electrons is still limited to a few times the ion beam speed in the reference frame of the electrons .",
    "this peak energy has furthermore been independent of the ion beam density .",
    "the peak energy has been 10 - 20 kev for the ion beam speed 0.1 c , which falls short of the 100 kev that are required for the electron injection into diffusive acceleration @xcite .",
    "higher electron energies may be reached when the ions thermalize .",
    "if both plasma clouds have the same density , the ion acceleration is identical close to the fronts of both beams and it amounts to maximally @xmath170 .",
    "the simulations have shown that the magnetic field is convected with the plasma slabs , as expected from the frozen - in theorem .",
    "the magnetic field strength doubles where both clouds overlap .",
    "we could observe well - developed electron phase space holes .",
    "the speed of their electrostatic potentials has been low , presumably due to the magnetic drag @xcite excerted on the trapped electrons .",
    "the electron surfing acceleration @xcite by the transport of the trapped electrons across the magnetic field has been weak .",
    "the ions at the front of the dense beam have been accelerated by @xmath171 in the simulation with the unequal cloud densities , while those at the front of the tenuous beam have only been scattered .",
    "this has originated in the asymmetric magnetic field compression .",
    "the magnetic field strength has increased by only 50% at the front of the tenuous beam while it has reached over 3 times its initial value at the front of the dense beam .",
    "the magnetic field strength has also varied more rapidly .",
    "this variation was correlated with a large - scale electric field , which may have been driven by the magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "it could strongly interact with the ions .",
    "this electric field has destroyed the electron phase space holes in the bulk plasma , probably because it has removed the stable equilibrium position of the potential .",
