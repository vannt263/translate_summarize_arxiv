    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is one of the most accurately measured quantities in particle physics .",

    "the present world average experimental value of its deviation from the dirac value , i.e. , @xmath0 , is given by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this impressive result is still limited by statistical errors , and a proposal to measure the muon @xmath2 to a precision of @xmath3 has recently been submitted to fnal @xcite .    at the level of the experimental accuracy ,",
    "the qed contributions to @xmath4 from photons and leptons alone are very well known . recently",
    "the calculation has been completed up to the fifth order @xmath5 in the fine - structure constant @xmath6 , giving as result for the qed contribution @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainties at present in the standard model calculation for @xmath2 originate from the hadronic vacuum polarization ( hvp ) as well as hadronic light - by - light scattering ( hlbl ) corrections .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ smcont ]    the existing discrepancy between the experimental value for @xmath2 and its standard model prediction stands at about @xmath8 .    in order to interpret the upcoming new experiment at fnal , with an anticipated precision of @xmath9",
    ", there is an urgent need to improve on both the hvp as well as the hlbl contributions .",
    "the accuracy of the hvp contribution depends on the statistical error of the experimental data for the @xmath10 annihilation cross - section into hadrons . with future experiments , in particular at bes - iii @xcite , one foresees this error to quantitatively decrease .",
    "the hlbl can not be directly related to any measurable cross section however , and requires the knowledge of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) contributions at all energy scales .",
    "since this is not known yet , one needs to rely on hadronic models to compute it .",
    "such models introduce some systematic errors which are difficult to quantify .",
    "the main motivation of this work is to provide a ballpark prediction with a judicious error estimate for the hlbl scattering based on a duality argument between the hadronic degrees of freedom and the well - known quark loop contribution .",
    "such a duality estimate can be obtained by invoking a particular regime of qcd where one knows how to perform the quark loop integral responsible for the @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ql ] ) .",
    "this is the large-@xmath12 of qcd @xcite where a quark - hadron duality is accounted for considering that hadronic amplitudes are described by an infinite set of non - interacting and non - decaying resonances . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the large-@xmath12 limit provides a very useful framework to approach this problem .    using the large-@xmath12 counting and also the chiral counting , it was proposed in @xcite to split the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : ql ] into a set of different contributions where the numerically dominant contribution arises from the pseudo - scalar exchange diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pionexchange ] @xcite .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] + .,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    the large-@xmath12 approach however has two shortcomings : firstly , the assumption of pion - exchange dominance implies that the remaining pieces are small enough to justify their omission .",
    "although this seems reasonable @xcite , it might lead to an underestimation of the error .",
    "secondly , calculations carried out in the large-@xmath12 limit demand an infinite set of resonances . as such sum",
    "is not known in practice , one ends up truncating the spectral function in a resonance saturation scheme , the so - called minimal hadronic approximation @xcite .",
    "the resonance masses used in each calculation are then taken as the physical ones from pdg @xcite instead of the corresponding masses in the large-@xmath12 limit .",
    "both problems might lead to large systematic errors not included so far @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in the large-@xmath12 framework , the minimal hadronic approximation can be understood from the mathematical theory of pad approximants ( pa ) to meromorphic functions . obeying the rules from this mathematical framework",
    ", one can compute the desired quantities in a model - independent way and even be able to ascribe a systematic error to the approach @xcite .",
    "one interesting detail from this theory @xcite is that given a low - energy expansion of a meromorphic function , a pa sequence converges much faster than a rational function with the poles fixed in advance ( such as the common hadronic models used so far for evaluating the hlbl ) , especially when the correct large @xmath13 behavior is imposed .",
    "to perform a quark - hadron duality estimate for the hlbl contribution to @xmath4 , we now discuss the direct contribution from the quark - loop diagram .",
    "the diagram with a light - quark running , with a mass of a few mev , is only valid in the regime where quarks are not confined , so in the perturbative qcd regime .",
    "this is not the region dominating the loop integral since we know that the momentum circulating the loop covers the low- and high - energy ranges . from quark models",
    ", one can use a constituent quark mass model with mass around @xmath14 mev as a rough estimate , with such a value obtained after comparing the quark model with the experimental value of the hvp  @xcite .",
    "this however , fails to reproduce the perturbative qcd result at high energies .",

    "the band corresponds to an error of @xmath15 on top of the chiral limit ( solid red line).,width=264 ]    ideally , lattice qcd calculations could be able to calculate such momentum dependent quark masses .",
    "as at present lattice qcd calculations are not yet fully feasible for physical pion masses , our proposal is to use the dressed - quark mass function @xmath16 in the chiral limit computed within the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) framework . as shown in fig .",
