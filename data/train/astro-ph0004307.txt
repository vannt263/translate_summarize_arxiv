    "there is evidence that the gravitational lens system pks 1830 - 211 has two absorbers at two different redshifts of 0.886 and 0.193 .",
    "the main lens , a normal galaxy at z=0.886 , has been studied in hi , oh and a host of molecular lines ( chengalur , de bruyn , & narasimha 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the only evidence for an additional absorber at z=0.193 is from hi absorption ( lovell et al .",
    "1996 ; verheijen et al . 1999 )",
    "searches for molecular lines at this redshift have been unsuccessful .",
    "taking advantage  of  the strong  radio  continuum of the background source ( s@xmath6 = 10 jy ) , we searched for stimulated emission recombination lines at both redshifts , using the vla at 20 cm ; the h158@xmath7  line from the z=0.193 system ( @xmath8=1.65 ghz ) using a bandwidth of 1.56 mhz and a velocity resolution of 5.3 km s@xmath9 and the h136@xmath7  line from the z=0.886 system ( @xmath8=2.59 ghz ) using a bandwidth of 3.125 mhz and a resolution of 21 km s@xmath9 .",
    "neither line was detected with 5@xmath10  upper limits to @xmath11  of 5 @xmath1  10@xmath2  and 5 @xmath1 10@xmath4 corresponding to z=0.193 and z=0.886 respectively .    since this source is highly variable",
    ", we used the vla to measure the continuum flux density at a single epoch over the frequency range 327 mhz to 45 ghz , to determine the intrinsic spectrum of the background source .",
    "the observations were made on 27 oct , 1997 with 3c 286 as the primary calibrator .",
    "figure 1 ( right ) shows the continuum flux density as a function of frequency . assuming that the core radiation at low frequencies has a flat spectrum , we derive upper limits to the free - free optical depth of @xmath12 @xmath3  0.13 at 330 mhz . for t@xmath13=7500 k ,",
    "the corresponding upper limit to the beam averaged emission measure is em @xmath3  4 @xmath1  10@xmath14  pc @xmath15  if the gas is at z=0.193 and em @xmath3  10@xmath16 pc @xmath15  if the gas is at z=0.886 .",
    "since the hi optical depth in the z=0.193 system is the same against both the lensed images of the quasar ( verheijen et al .",
    "1999 ) , we assume that the line emitting gas is uniformly distributed in a slab against the entire continuum source . figure 1 ( left ) shows the maximum allowable emission measure of the gas as a function of density that is consistent with the upper limits to the line strength and the continuum optical depth , assuming a line width of 80 km s@xmath9 .",
    "fig 1 shows that our experiment is most sensitive to low density gas ( n@xmath13  = 1@xmath510 @xmath17 ) and indicates an upper limit to the _ beam averaged _ emission measure of 100 pc @xmath15  for this gas in the z=0.193 system .",
    "if the line emitting gas is predominantly of density 5@xmath510 @xmath17 , then the size of such a region located anywhere in the observed beam is constrained to be less than 200@xmath5300 pc in size , assuming a homogenous gas distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the gas is in compact structures with density @xmath1810@xmath19   @xmath17 , then its beam filling factor is constrained to be less than 6 @xmath1  10@xmath4 .",
    "higher resolution observations of the line at comparable sensitivities and the knowledge of the system s inclination angle will greatly improve the constraints on the ism in the z=0.193 absorber .",
    "the limits for the z=0.886 system are about ten times higher .",
    "we thank s. nair for useful discussions ."
