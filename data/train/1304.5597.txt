    "the si nanowire field effect transistors ( snwfets ) with all around gates have recently emerged as a promising device to replace the conventional planar metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors ( mosfets ) as the latter face the physical and technological challenges in their scaling - down@xcite .",
    "the snwfets have the merit of good electrostatic control and hence can deliver high on - state currents . as their overall performance",
    "is determined by the aspect ratio of the channel length ( @xmath0 ) and channel width ( @xmath1)@xcite , it may be desirable to utilize thinner and thinner nanowires .",
    "however , rough interfaces between si and dielectric are unavoidably generated during the fabrication processes , and currents become limited by surface roughness scattering ( srs ) as the nanowire cross - sectional size is reduced below @xmath2 nm@xcite .",
    "the srs effects in snwfets have been a subject of intense theoretical and computational studies .",
    "most of the studies have been performed with the semiclassical approaches such as the kubo - greenwood approach@xcite , the multi - subband monte carlo technique@xcite , and the direct solution of the one - dimensional boltzmann transport equation@xcite .",
    "the schrodinger - poisson equations are self - consistently solved in the approaches assuming an infinitely extended homogeneous nanowire , before the nanowire subband information is extracted and fed to the semiclassical procedures .",
    "there have also been a few studies based the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method@xcite , where coherent electron transport across the channel region with rough si / dielectric interfaces is considered fully quantum - mechanically . in the non - perturbative approach , the screening effect , electron phase coherence , and the mode mixing effect , among others ,",
    "are naturally considered whereas these are hard to be implemented directly or disregarded entirely in the semiclassical approaches .",
    "most of the negf studies have so far focused on the low field electron mobility in nanowires .",
    "however , the mobility in the device with a finite channel length is not a proper measure for the device performance , because the mobility increases as the channel length increases whereas there should be more detrimental scattering .",
    "as gnani has pointed out , the mean free path ( mfp ) should be a better indicator of the device performance@xcite .",
    "in this work , using the non - perturbative negf approach , we have for the first time investigated the sr - limited mfp in snwfets .",
    "novelty and contributions of this work are : @xmath3 ) we have devised a systematic way to calculate the mfp in the device with a finite channel length , @xmath4 ) we have identified the entrance scattering effect which is unavoidable in the device with a source / channel / drain structure , estimated its strength , and eliminated it from the mfp calculation , and @xmath5 ) we have thoroughly investigated the behavior of the mfp with a particular emphasis on its dependence on the strength of the srs effects .",
    "these will be discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "the simulated devices in this work are three - dimensional ( @xmath5d ) rectangular silicon nanowire fets with all - around gates as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1device ] . the source and drain regions are heavily @xmath6-doped with doping concentration of @xmath7@xmath8 whereas the channel is intrinsic .",
    "the sio@xmath9 oxide thickness is assumed to be @xmath3 nm . to describe the electron transport in the conduction band ,",
    "the effective mass hamiltonian was used , with the effective masses being scaled according to the tight - binding calculation@xcite .",
    "all the six equivalent valleys are included in the simulations .",
    "the surface roughness ( sr ) was realized at four si / sio@xmath9 interfaces in the channel region only .",
    "sr was generated according to the exponentially decaying autocorrelation function expressed as @xmath10 + where @xmath11 is the root - mean square ( rms ) fluctuation of the roughness , @xmath12 is the correlation length , and @xmath13 is the two - dimensional distance between two points on the interface . by fourier - transforming the autocorrelation function to obtain the power density spectrum ( pds ) , multiplying a random phase factor to the square root value of pds , and inverse fourier - transforming the randomized pds , instances of rough si / sio@xmath9 interfaces were randomly generated@xcite .",
    "we have employed the negf method to calculate the charge density and the current in the devices with rough surfaces in the channel region .",
    "self - consistent calculations coupling the charge density from the negf equations and the potential from poisson s equation were carried out .",
    "the methodology is well established in the literature@xcite .",
    "the negf procedure with the rough surfaces is the same as the standard non - diffusive calculation procedure .",
    "there is no need to calculate the less - than or greater - than green s functions , because the surface roughness scattering ( srs ) is not treated by including the self - energy in the green s function .",
    "rather , the conduction band edge @xmath14 at the si / sio@xmath9 interfaces is spatially varied in accordance with the generated rough surfaces .",
    "in other words , in the hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kinetic part of the hamiltonian with the inverse effective mass tensor which is not altered by sr , @xmath14 assumes the value of of 0.56 ev or 3.63 ev , if @xmath17 corresponds to silicon or oxide points , respectively . in the poisson s equation , @xmath18 @xmath19 is also spatially varying in the same manner as @xmath20 .    in this work ,",
    "the coupled mode space approach was used @xcite with the number of modes ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 depending on the cross - sectional width of nanowire .",
    "including higher modes little changed the outcome of the calculations , which validates that the used number of modes is sufficient .",
    "in the nanowire fet in fig .  [ fig : fig1device ] , electrons experience quantum mechanical scattering by the channel potential barrier as they enter the channel region .",
    "the channel potential barrier is present due to the fact that the source / drain and channel regions are doped with different doping concentrations .",
    "the entrance scattering effect ( ese ) takes place even in the ballisticity condition ( no rough surfaces in the channel region ) and should be separated out from the calculated mean free path .",
    "the method to isolate the pure contributions from the channel region is elaborated in section iv .    in the nanowire device under consideration ,",
    "the ballistic current @xmath23 can be expressed as , at low @xmath24 , @xmath25 + where @xmath26 is the @xmath27-@xmath28 order modified fermi integral , @xmath29 is the energy level of subband @xmath30 in the channel region , @xmath31 is the fermi energy , and @xmath32 is the transmission probability in subband @xmath30 that accounts for backscattering due to ese . if the source / drain regions are removed and the same cross - section of the channel region is repeated indefinitely , there is no ese and @xmath33 in ( [ eq : ib ] ) .",
    "let us denote the ballistic current in the infinitely long homogeneous nanowire as @xmath34 .",
    "we write @xmath35 where the effective transmission coefficient @xmath36 is introduced as a measure for the degree of ese in the nanowire device .",
    "[ fig : fig2potandte ] ( a ) shows @xmath36 versus @xmath37 for various @xmath1 s , where it is shown that @xmath36 is as low as about @xmath38 and its dependence on @xmath37 is not sensitive to @xmath1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2potandte ] ( b ) , the channel potential barrier is so high in the subthreshold regime that an electron is either completely reflected or completely transmitted depending on whether its energy is below or above the potential barrier , except for a very narrow window of energy located just above the potential barrier where it experiences the quantum - mechanical backscattering .",
    "so @xmath36 is close to 1 in the subthreshold regime . around @xmath39 ,",
    "the potential barrier is lowered and at the same time its shape near the ends of the channel becomes sharper so that the quantum mechanical backscattering starts to occur seriously .",
    "in other words , the above - mentioned energy window broadens , resulting in a sharp decrease of @xmath36 . if the gate voltage is further increased , @xmath36 reaches a minima and then slightly increases , because the channel potential barrier is sufficiently lowered to result in lesser backscattering . +",
    "in devices with finite channel length , the effective mobility is no longer a good indicator of device performance , as it tends to zero as the ballistical condition is approached whereas the on current increases @xcite . instead , the mean free path ( mfp ) that is directly related to electron transmission in the device is better suited as the indicator of device performance . in this work ,",
    "the sr - limited mfp is calculated as follows .    at a low drain bias",
    ", we relate @xmath40 with @xmath34 via @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the overall transmission coefficient in the device .",
    "@xmath42 consists of contributions from the entrance scattering ( @xmath43 and the surface roughness scattering ( @xmath44 ) . in an attempt to isolate @xmath44",
    ", we write    @xmath45     + which is written based on the simple picture that the two sources of scattering are connected serially@xcite . using the defining relationship for the sr - limited mfp @xmath46 , @xmath47",
    "we finally obtain @xmath48 notice that in defining @xmath42 in ( [ eq : it ] ) , @xmath34 is used instead of @xmath23 .",
    "if the relationship @xmath49 is used instead of ( [ eq : it ] ) , it implies that ese is disregarded , and we may write @xmath50 the mfp @xmath51 of the above equation is related to @xmath46 as : @xmath52 that is , the mfp is multiplied by the factor @xmath53 , which leads to an unphysical peak as demonstrated below .    before proceeding further ,",
    "we first show @xmath40 as a function of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm_i ] , which verifies that diffusive transport expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t_sr ] ) or ( [ eq : t_prm ] ) actually takes place due to sr .",
    "note that we have deliberately chosen the device width and the sr parameters in the figure so that resultant mfp is as small as about 10 nm ( consult fig .  [ fig : mfpr](a ) ) .",
    "[ fig : mfpl ] shows thus - calculated @xmath46 for snwfets of @xmath54 nm . for @xmath0 varying from @xmath55 nm to @xmath56 nm , @xmath46 seems to depend on @xmath0 weakly .",
    "the mfp calculated by using ( [ eq : biglambda ] ) is also displayed in the figure : @xmath51 shows a pronounced peak around @xmath39 when there is no physical reason for the feature .",
    "this supports that @xmath46 is a more natural choice for the mfp than @xmath51 . in the @xmath46 versus @xmath37 curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpl ] , however , there is still some hint of a peak around @xmath39 .",
    "we believe that this is an artifact which is originated from the imperfect nature in the process of isolating the pure sr contribution in the channel region ( ( [ eq:1/t ] ) ) . as a matter of fact , ( [ eq:1/t ] ) should hold better for greater @xmath0 because the assumption that the two sources of scattering ( es and sr ) are incoherently connected becomes more valid .",
    "[ fig : mfpw ] shows the mfp for different @xmath1 s when @xmath0 is fixed at @xmath57 nm . the mfp decreases as @xmath1 becomes smaller , as expected , but the above - mentioned peaky feature near @xmath39 is more pronounced at larger @xmath1 .",
    "hereafter let us set aside the unphysical peaky feature near @xmath39 and concentrate on the mfp in the subthreshold region ( @xmath58 ) and the inversion region ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "our key findings in this work with regard to the mfp s are : @xmath3 ) the dimensionless parameter @xmath60 can be used as a good measure of the srs strength , @xmath4 ) the mfp s exponentially decrease with @xmath60 , and @xmath5 ) @xmath59 becomes greater than @xmath58 if @xmath61 .",
    "firstly , both @xmath58 and @xmath59 exponentially decrease with @xmath60 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpex ] , where @xmath46 s were calculated for all the possible combinations of @xmath1 = @xmath5 , @xmath62 , and @xmath2 nm and @xmath63 is @xmath64 nm . @xmath58 and @xmath59 were evaluated at @xmath65 = @xmath66 v and @xmath67 v , respectively . notice that @xmath1 is restricted to below @xmath2 nm here .",
    "in particular , @xmath59 for @xmath68 nm converges to the almost the same value , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpw ] .",
    "the fact that the mfp can be described by a single parameter @xmath60 , even with different @xmath1 s , is quite interesting . for the size quantization effects associated with channel width , such as the degree of wave - function confinement , the number of subbands , and the degree of the mixing between subbands ,",
    "are expected to result in the mfp s dependence on @xmath1 in a complicate way .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations show the mfp s exponential dependence on @xmath60 . this should give a useful guide for the estimation of @xmath46 in si nanowire devices .",
    "secondly , we have found that , if the srs effects become sufficiently strong , @xmath46 increases with the increase of @xmath37 and , as the consequence , @xmath69 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the usual case where @xmath46 should decrease with the increase of @xmath37 , because more intense scattering is expected to occur at higher gate voltages . in our calculations ,",
    "the latter is observed for the cases of the srs effects being relatively weak .",
    "see @xmath46 for @xmath1 = @xmath2 nm ( @xmath63 = @xmath70 nm ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpl ] and that for @xmath1 = @xmath71 and @xmath72 nm ( @xmath63 = @xmath73 nm ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpw ] , respectively .",
    "however , as @xmath1 becomes smaller in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpw ] , the usual behavior is not seen any longer and @xmath59 becomes greater than @xmath58 .",
    "we argue that the ratio @xmath74 has to do with the strength of the srs effects and that @xmath60 is a good measure for the strength .",
    "obviously , the srs effects should become stronger as @xmath1 becomes smaller for fixed @xmath63(case @xmath75 ) or as @xmath63 becomes bigger for fixed @xmath1(case @xmath76 ) . for case @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath63 is fixed to @xmath73 nm and @xmath1 is varied as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpw ] , and we observe that @xmath74 becomes bigger than @xmath3 if @xmath77 . for case @xmath76 , @xmath1 is fixed to @xmath5 nm and @xmath63 is varied as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpr ] ( a ) . for @xmath63",
    "= @xmath70 nm in the figure , @xmath46 already starts to ascend in the inversion regime , although quite slowly .",
    "as @xmath63 is increased to @xmath73 nm and then to @xmath67 nm , @xmath46 ascends more and more steeply and @xmath59 becomes as big as about ten times of @xmath58 for @xmath63 = @xmath67 nm .",
    "( also compare the curves of @xmath1 = @xmath2 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpl ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpw ] , where @xmath63 is changed from @xmath70 nm to @xmath73 nm . )    if we combine cases @xmath75 and @xmath76 and plot @xmath74 versus @xmath60 in fig .  [ fig : mfpr ] ( b ) , we observe that the ratio @xmath74 generally increases with the increase of @xmath60 , although there are small fluctuations .",
    "@xmath74 crosses the line of @xmath3 at @xmath78 in the figure .",
    "thus we conclude that the characteristics of the srs effects in si nanowires change at @xmath78 .",
    "that @xmath59 becomes greater than @xmath58 for the strong srs effects can be qualitatively explained as follows . in figs .",
    "[ fig:3dnd ] ( b ) and ( c ) , the cross - sectional charge densities for the cases of @xmath63 = @xmath70 and @xmath67 nm are compared at low and high gate voltages ( @xmath1 = @xmath5 nm ) . in the charge density profiles at low gate voltage ,",
    "the si / sio@xmath9 interfaces that fluctuate in proportion to @xmath63 can be directly observed . in the charge density profiles at high gate voltage",
    ", however , the degree of the interface fluctuations seems to be almost invariant to the increase of the surface roughness .",
    "the latter is due to the wave function confinement effect which is of particular importance for nanowires of @xmath79 nm , and consequently , the electrons are concentrated to the center of the nanowire as seen in the figure @xcite .",
    "hence the ` effective ' surface roughness that felt by the electrons is less at high gate voltage than at low gate voltage .",
    "this effect intensifies as @xmath63 is increased or @xmath1 is decreased , resulting in the relationship between @xmath74 and @xmath60 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpr ] ( b ) . on the other hand , for nanowires of @xmath80 nm ,",
    "the confinement effect is weak so the electrons are pushed to the nanowire surfaces at high gate voltage , resulting in the expected behavior that the mfp decreases with the increase of the gate voltage as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dnd ] ( a ) .",
    "in this work , we have systematically devised the methodology for the calculation of the mean free path in the nanowire field effect transistors with finite channel length .",
    "the parasitic entrance scattering effects were identified and carefully eliminated from the mfp calculations . non - perturbative approach based on the non - equilibrium green s function method",
    "was used to address the srs effects in the nanowire transistors . the methodology developed in this work",
    "can be applied to any scattering mechanism , although only srs is considered here .",
    "we have found that the sr - limited mfp can be well described by a function which depends on a single parameter @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , the mfp in the subthreshold regime exponentially decreases with the increase of @xmath60 . for nanowires of @xmath79 nm",
    ", the mfp in the inversion regime also exponentially decreases with @xmath60 .",
    "we have also found that the dimensionless parameter @xmath60 can be used as a good measure of the srs strength .",
    "if @xmath81 , one may expect that the srs effects should be relatively weak , resulting in the usual behavior that the mfp decreases with the increase of the gate electric field .",
    "if @xmath82 , on the other hand , the srs effects can be regarded to be strong , resulting in the extraordinary behavior that the mfp increases with the increase of the gate electric field .",
