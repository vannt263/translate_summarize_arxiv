    "the x - ray source 4u 162667 was discovered with the uhuru satellite ( giacconi et al .",

    "optical counterpart of the pulsar was identified as kz tra , a faint blue star ( v @xmath0 18.5 ) with little or no reddening ( mcclintock et al . 1977 ; bradt and mcclintock 1983 ) . optical pulsations with 2% amplitude were detected at the same frequency as the x - ray pulsations ( ilovaisky , motch , & chevalier 1978 ) and are understood to be due to reprocessing of the pulsed x - ray flux by the accretion disk ( chester 1979 ) . a faint optical counterpart and",
    "the observed optical pulsed fraction requires the companion star to be of very small mass ( mcclintock et al .",
    "1977 , 1980 )",
    ". the x - ray light curve does not show any orbital modulation or eclipse .",
    "however , from the reprocessed pulsed optical emission and a close sideband in the power - spectrum of optical light curve , an orbital period of 42 minutes was inferred ( middleditch et al . 1981 ) .",
    "therefore , it falls under the category of ultra compact binaries ( p@xmath1 @xmath2 80 minutes ) , which have hydrogen - depleted secondaries to reach such short periods ( paczynski & sienkiewicz 1981 ; nelson et al .",
    "1986 ) .    despite extensive searches ,",
    "the orbital motion of this binary has never been detected in the x - ray pulse timing studies ( rappaport et al , 1977 ; levine et al .",
    "1988 ; jain et al . 2007 ) .",
    "a very low mass secondary , in a nearly face on orbit can possibly account for the lack of pulse arrival time delay .",
    "recently jain et al ( 2007 ) have also proposed this source to be a candidate for a neutron star with a supernova fall back accretion disk . from the extensive timing and spectral observations both in optical and x - ray bands ,",
    "it has not yet been possible to establish the presence of a binary companion , and the upper limit of the companion mass has been determined to be very low . however , the presence of an accretion disk in 4u 162667 is beyond any doubt .",
    "optical spectral and timing studies confirm that most of the optical emission is strongly dominated by the accretion disk ( grindlay 1978 ; mcclintock et al .",
    "the x - ray spectrum also shows bright hydrogen - like and helium - like oxygen and neon emission lines with red and blue shifted components , a certain sign for accretion disk origin ( schulz et al .",
    "2001 , krauss et al .",
    "another direct evidence of an accretion disk in 4u 162667 is found from the detection of quasi - periodic oscillations , at a frequency of 40 mhz , from ginga observations ( shinoda et al .",
    "1990 ) and subsequently at a higher frequency of about 48 mhz from beppo - sax , asca , rxte and xmm - newton ( owens et al . 1997 ; angelini et al . 1995 ; kommers et al .",
    "1998 , krauss et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the qpos have also been detected in reprocessed optical emission from both ground based and hst observations ( chakrabarty et al . 1998 , 2001 ) .    for more than a decade since its discovery",
    ", 4u 162667 was found to be spinning up with a characteristic timescale p / p @xmath0 5000 yr .",
    "it was found to be spinning down at about the same rate by batse onboard cgro in the beginning of 1991 ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "even though the torque reversal was abrupt , the decrease in bolometric x - ray flux has been gradual and continuous over the past @xmath0 30 yr ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 , krauss et al 2007 ) .",
    "recently , from a set of chandra monitoring observations krauss et al ( 2007 ) have established that the bolometric x - ray flux and various emission line fluxes have decreased continuously over the last few years , indicating a gradual depletion of the accretion disk . the x - ray flux and mass accretion rate are directly related and these are likely to be related to the mass and extent of the material in the accretion disk .",
    "therefore , the observed gradual decrease in x - ray flux indicates a depletion of material in the accretion disk of the pulsar .",
    "another signature of this is seen by krauss et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as a change in the pulse profile of the pulsar as compared to the earlier observations .    in the present work ,",
    "we have investigated the qpo frequency evolution of 4u 162667 over a long period and discuss the relation of the change in qpo frequency with the a possible recession of the inner accretion disk .",

    "an error bar plotted on each point in fig 3 represents 1@xmath4 error estimates .",
    "we could nt find ginga observations of 4u 162667 made in july , 1988 from archive data , thus the central frequency of qpos and error estimate on it is taken from shinoda et al .",
    "1990 and is also shown in fig 3 . to confirm the consistency of qpo frequency for each data set listed in table 1 , the qpo frequencies were measured from smaller segments of the data , 10 each for the 1996 rxte observation and the 2004 xmm observation .",
    "the values determined from smaller segments have larger uncertainties but within uncertainties , these values are consistent with the qpo frequency measured using the complete data sets in each case .",
    "it can be clearly seen in figure 3 that the qpo central frequency has increased from 1983 to 1993 and after that it gradually decreased from 1993 to 2004 .",

    ", a constant model is also fitted to the data from 1993 to 2004 .",
    "the reduced @xmath6 for a constant model is 3.22 for 6 degrees of freedom , indicates poor fit as compared to the linear fit .",
    "in high magnetic field x - ray pulsars , the qpo frequency is in the range of a few mhz to a few hz ( kaur et al .",
    "the qpos are known to occur sporadically , only in a few percent of the x - ray observations .",
    "for example , qpos are detected in only 15% of the out - of - eclipse observations of cen x-3 ( raichur et al .",
    "our independent investigation of the rxte - pca lightcurves of several persistent sources show that the qpos are quite rare .",
    "exception to this are some of the transient sources , like 3a 0535 + 262 ( finger et al .",
    "1996 ) , and xte j1858 + 034 ( paul & rao 1998 ) which showed qpos during most of the observations made during their outbursts .",
    "in the present study , using lightcurves of 4u 162667 taken with various observatories over a period of more than 20 years we have detected qpos in every single observation of sufficient length .",
    "this is the first accretion powered pulsar for which the qpo study has been made over a long time scale . in this",
    "regard , 4u 162667 is unique among persistent high magnetic field accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "it shows that the accretion disk of the pulsar is quite stable to hold this feature for years .",
    "however , in a few cases , the observation duration was not long enough to make accurate measurement of the qpo parameters .",
    "qpos in accretion powered x - ray sources are widely believed to arise due to inhomogeneities near the inner accretion disk .",
    "the qpo frequency is the keplerian frequency at the inner disk radius and is therefore positively related to the mass accretion rate or the x - ray luminosity . if the compact object is a neutron star , the inner disk is coupled with the central object through the magnetic field lines and qpos corresponding to the beat frequency between the spin frequency and the keplerian frequency of the inner disk can also be seen . in accretion powered high magnetic field x - ray pulsars , the two different qpos are never seen to occur in the same source . in some of the sources , like 4u 162667 ,",
    "the qpo frequency is lower than the spin frequency and therefore the qpos can only be explained by the bfm .    according to both kfm and bfm , the radius of the qpo production area , r@xmath7 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath8 where g is the gravitational constant , m@xmath9 is the mass of the neutron star and @xmath10 is the keplerian frequency of the inner accretion disk .",
    "the radius of the inner accretion disk , r@xmath11 can be defined as @xmath12 where l@xmath13 is the x - ray luminosity in units of 10@xmath14 ergs s@xmath15 and @xmath16 is magnetic moment in units of 10@xmath17 @xmath18gauss . if the qpos are as per keplerian frequency model ( @xmath10 = @xmath19 , where @xmath19 is qpo frequency of the pulsar ) , then we expect @xmath10 @xmath20 @xmath21 or @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the flux of 4u 162667 has decreased from 0.32 to 0.15 units from 1993 to 2004 ( krauss et al .",
    "2007 ) , implies that the change in qpo frequency is expected to be @xmath3 27% from 1993 to 2004 .",
    "the present qpo observations have shown only 4 % decrease in qpo frequency during the same time .",
    "however , keplerian frequency model is not valid in this source . in the bfm ( @xmath10 = @xmath19 + @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is pulsar spin frequency )",
    ", the inner disk frequency is higher as compared to kfm , and the relative change in qpo frequency is expected to be even larger . therefore , we see that the evolution of qpo frequency and the decrease of x - ray flux can not be explained in the standard qpo generation mechanism and usual relation between inner disk and x - ray luminosity .",
    "we can consider two possibilities : one is that the qpos are not generated from the inner disk , these are generated due to reprocessing in some outer structure of the disk .",
    "this is not very likely due to the large ( upto 15% ) rms in the qpo feature .",
    "second possibility is that the observed x - ray flux change is not due to change of mass accretion rate by the same factor .",
    "many x - ray sources show x - ray flux variation at long time scale upto a few months due to obstruction provided by complex accretion disk mechanism .",
    "the earlier study by chakrabarty et al . ( 1997 ) has concluded that there was an abrupt torque reversal in 1990 and the system moved from spin - up to spin - down era with a characteristic time scale p / p of @xmath3 5000 yr . the two qpo detections with exosat ( 35 mhz in 1983 ) and ginga ( 40 mhz in 1988 ) are during the spin - up era of this pulsar , with increasing trend while the observations from 1993 to 2004 , in the spin - down era , showed a slow decreasing trend in qpo frequency with time , somewhat coincident with the torque reversal in this source , shown in fig 3 .",
    "qpo frequency is found to be decreasing in the spin - down era with a frequency derivative of @xmath3 ( 0.2 @xmath5 0.05 ) mhz / yr . the x - ray spectral and flux evolution study along with pulse profile changes of 4u 162667 by krauss et al ( 2007 ) have concluded that the accretion disk in this source is depleting with a time scale of 30 - 70 years .",
    "krauss et al . ( 2007 ) has also estimated the long term average accretion rate to be 3 @xmath23 10@xmath24 m@xmath25 yr@xmath15 for a distance @xmath26 3kpc . however",
