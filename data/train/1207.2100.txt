    "the intrinsic spin hall effect refers to the generation of a dissipationless spin current in response to an external transverse electric field , it was predicted to occur in p - type semiconductors@xcite and n - type heterostructures,@xcite and it was observed experimentally in non - magnetic two - dimensional systems.@xcite the effect originates in the correlation between the particle s motion , driven by the external electric field , and its spin , through the spin - orbit interaction . in the case of a two - dimensional electron gas with spin - orbit rashba coupling ( in an inversion asymmetric layer ) , the spin hall conductivity is suppressed by impurity scattering.@xcite however , breaking time invariance by the presence of magnetic impurities , restores the spin hall effect.@xcite remarkably , spin transport in a magnetic disordered layer is reinforced by multiple scattering interactions , and , for a large range of impurity concentrations ( in the weak disorder regime ) , the spin conductivity remains near its universal clean value , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the electron charge).@xcite two questions arise naturally concerning the behavior of the spin hall conductivity : first , how does it evolve in the strong disorder regime , in particular , does the system undergo a localization transition ; second , what is the influence of the carrier mediated interactions between impurities , that may induce a ferromagnetic transition . in this paper we shall focus on the first problem , the dependence of @xmath2 on the concentration and strength of the paramagnetic disorder .",
    "the understanding of spin transport mechanisms in semiconductors , in which the existence of a strong spin - orbit coupling enables the electrical manipulation of the spin , is important for spintronics applications.@xcite in particular , recent experiments in magnetically doped semiconductors,@xcite reveal interesting physical phenomena , such as the generation of spin currents,@xcite the fractal geometry of localized states,@xcite and intriguing properties of the intrinsic anomalous hall effect.@xcite these experiments show the interplay between confinement , spin - orbit splitting , magnetic disorder and carrier mediated interactions . their combined action drives spin transport , determines the magnetization structure , and governs the localization transition , that modifies in turn the magnetic properties and the spin conductivity .",
    "a minimal model hamiltonian accounting for these effects , must contain a hopping term , a rashba term coupling the carrier s momentum to their spin , and an exchange term with the interaction of the itinerant spins with the magnetic moments of randomly distributed impurities.@xcite    most studies on dilute magnetic semiconductor quantum wells , deal with the influence of the carrier induced ferromagnetic transition and phase separation on the transport mechanisms , and more specifically , with the existence of carrier localized states and their impact on the anomalous hall effect.@xcite as a natural extension to these investigations , we focus in this paper on the intrinsic spin hall current , which arises , as the analogous intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity , from the berry phase contribution to the velocity operator.@xcite our goal is to identify the anderson localization of the carriers as a function of the disorder strength , and to relate the geometry of the quantum states to the spin transport properties beyond the weak disorder regime .",

    "the presence of interference effects in the spreading of the wave function are investigated , in the weak disorder approximation , using the linear response theory .",
    "we compute the quantum corrections to the spin conductivity , and find that a weak antilocalization effect arises , which is essentially proportional to the spin - orbit induced spin splitting .    the spin hall conductivity , which initially decreases with the disorder strength , undergoes a drastic increase in the strong disorder limit , especially when impurity bands appear in the density of states .",

    "[ s - wave ] , resulting from the fractal geometry of the quantum states and their localization .",

    "we observe that , near the localization transition , the energy distribution of states differs between sites , depending strongly on whether they are occupied or not by an impurity .",
    "for a given impurity , electronic states display a large distribution of energies .",

    "this systematic asymmetry is related to the spin dependence of the localized states . for strong disorder , there are sites for which the quantum states have energies almost entirely concentrated in the impurity bands , these states are strongly spin polarized .    the striking enhancement of the spin conductivity , starting at the localization transition , can be explained in terms of the strong spatial spin fluctuations at the impurity sites .",
    "indeed , the spin current results from the imbalance between counter propagating spin - up and spin - down electrons ; the presence of a magnetic impurity locally produces a marked bias in the spin orientation , due to the electron wave function localization : only states with the appropriate spin polarization are allowed . as we have shown before , quantum corrections , proportional to the spin - orbit splitting ,",
    "tend to increase the spin conductivity ; yet , in the strong disorder regime , the spin splitting is notably strengthened as a consequence of the localization of states around the impurities .",
    "the result is that , in the presence of an electric field , the usual torque mechanism that drives opposite spins to drift in opposite directions , transversally to the electric current,@xcite is greatly reinforced by the strong local spin splitting .     at fixed @xmath165",

    "we then studied the corrections to the spin conductivity due to quantum interference in the weak disorder regime , using the linear response theory .",
    "finally , we computed the spin conductivity in the strong disorder regime .",
    "the evolution of a wave packet shows a rich dynamical behavior , with a disorder dependent spreading exponent , ranging from almost ballistic to slightly subdiffusive motion .",
    "this seems to be controlled by the modification introduced by the spin - orbit interaction , to the simple free motion .",
    "it is at variance with the usual diffusion observed in a random magnetic field , or even in disordered symplectic systems , and reminiscent to the behavior of quasi periodic systems .",

    "the dynamical inverse participation ratio remains finite at long times , indicating the spatial localization of the quantum states .",
    "this is confirmed by the spectral properties as displayed by the local density of states . in the localized regime ,",
    "a strong intermittence arises ( arithmetic and geometric means do not coincide ) , characterized be the appearance of strong spin correlations between carriers and impurities .",
    "it is natural to think that the interference effects observed in the phenomenology of the wave packet spreading , should modify the spin transport .",
    "indeed , the analytical computation of the quantum corrections using the kubo linear response theory , shows that these effects contribute to increase the spin conductivity , and that they are proportional to the spin - orbit splitting energy .",
    "yet , the effect of the localization on the spin conductivity is rather surprising .",
    "we found that the spin conductivity actually pass a minimum at the transition , and strongly increases with disorder in the localized regime .",
    "the sticking of the electronic energy states to the impurities location , and the high spin polarization , contribute to reinforce the spin splitting and enhance the spin density fluctuations that , when an electric field is applied , will drift in opposite directions to create a strong spin current .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize the present one particle model in a random potential to take into account the electron mediated interactions between magnetic impurities .",
    "this would allow us to investigate the interplay of anderson localization and ferromagnetic transitions , and their influence on the spin transport , as revealed for instance in recent experiments.@xcite    we are grateful to r. hayn and t. martin for useful discussions .",
    "we thank x. leoncini for his interest in this work .",
