    "the need of nonperturbative methods in in quantum physics is obvious considering the many problems where strong coupling and/or binding effects render perturbation theory inadequate . in nonrelativistic many - body physics",
    "variational methods are widely used under these circumstances while this is _ not _ the case in relativistic field theory .",
    "however , feynman s successful treatment of the polaron problem @xcite shows that variational methods may also be used for a nonrelativistic field theory provided that the fast degrees of freedom can be integrated out and their effect properly taken into account in the trial action . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "( henceforth referred to as ( i ) ) we have extended the polaron variational method to the simplest scalar field theory which describes heavy particles ( `` nucleons '' ) interacting by the exchange of light particles ( `` mesons '' ) . in euclidean space - time the lagrangian of the wick - cutkosky model is given by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the bare mass of the nucleon , @xmath5 is the mass of the meson and @xmath6 is the ( dimensionfull ) coupling constant of the yukawa interaction between them . in the quenched approximation",

    "it is , of course , impossible to perform this path integral exactly and , again following feynman , we have approximated it variationally by a retarded quadratic two - time action . in ( i ) we have proposed various parameterizations for the retardation function which enters this trial action and derived variational equations for the most general case when its form was left free .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate numerically these parametrizations as well as to solve the variational equations .",
    "this fixes the variational parameters which will be used to calculate physical observables in forthcoming applications .",
    "one quantity which we evaluate in the present paper is the residue on the pole of the propagator .",
    "another one is related to the well - known instability @xcite of the wick - cutkosky model : although the effective action ( [ eff action ] ) is very similar to the one in the polaron model the ground state of the system is only metastable .",
    "this does not show up in any order of perturbation theory but , as we have demonstrated in ( i ) , the variational approach knows about it .",
    "indeed an approximate solution of the variational equations has revealed that there are no real solutions beyond a certain critical coupling . in the present paper",
    "we will find exact numerical values for this critical coupling and calulate the width of the unstable particle for couplings beyond it .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the essential points of the polaron variational approach are collected in section [ sec : polaron ] , while section [ sec : numerical ] is devoted to the numerical methods and results . in section [ sec : width ] we investigate the instability of the wick - cutkosky model in our variational method and determine analytically and numerically the width of the dressed particle .",
    "the variational principle can also be applied away from the pole , which is explored in section [ sec : var 2point off pole ] and used to calculate the residue at the nucleon pole .",
    "the main results of this work are summarized in the last section .",

    "of course , the model does not really give a realistic description of the pion - nucleon interaction as spin- and isospin degrees of freedom as well as chiral symmetry are missing .",
    "in short , we use @xmath58 and the results are presented as function of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath59 the relevant quantity for the physical situation is the strength of the yukawa potential between two nucleons due to one - pion exchange @xcite , which is approximately given by ( depending on the spin - isospin channel ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the pion - nucleon coupling . in the wick - cutkosky scalar model",

    "the reason for this somehow unexpected result is the neglect of exponentially suppressed terms in deriving eq .",
    "( [ 2point expressed by f0,f1 ] ) .",
    "indeed it is easy to see that one obtains the correct perturbative self - energy only if the upper limit of the @xmath39-integral is kept at @xmath25 and not extended to infinity as we have done in deriving eq .",
    "( [ 2point expressed by f0,f1 ] ) .",
    "the difference is one of the many exponentially suppressed terms which we have neglected .",
    "thus , the off - shell variational equations ( [ var eq off ] ) only hold in the vicinity of the nucleon pole and in order to investigate variationally the two - point function far away ( say near the meson production threshold @xmath77 ) one has to include consistently all terms which are exponentially suppressed in @xmath25 .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in the present work we have performed variational calculations for the ` wick - cutkosky polaron ' following the approach which was developed previously @xcite . we have determined different parametrizations as well as the full variational solution for the retardation function which enters the trial action . since the nucleon mass is fixed on the pole of the 2-point function the value of",
    "the functional which we minimize is of no physical significance but only a measure of the quality of the corresponding ansatz .",
    "this is in contrast to the familiar quantum - mechanical case where an upper limit to the ground - state energy of the system is obtained .",
    "however , our calculation fixes the variational parameters with which we then can calculate other observables of physical interest .",
    "one of these quantities was the residue on the pole of the propagator for which we have compared numerically the results of the variational calculations to first order perturbation theory in table  table : residue . for small couplings",
    "all results for the residue agree , since in this case the variational approach necessarily reduces to perturbation theory independent of the value of the variational parameters .",
    "what is rather remarkable is that for larger couplings the three parametrizations of the profile function in our variational approach yield rather similar results , which are now of course different from the perturbative calculation .",
    "as we have seen , the ` improved ' and ` variational ' actions have the same singularity behaviour , for small relative times , as the true action , so here one might expect some similarity in the results .",
    "this is however not true for the ` feynman ' parameterization which has a rather different form , so its agreement with the other two is not preordained .",
    "this similarity is also exhibited in tables  [ table : var feyn ] and  [ table : var improved ] for @xmath28 and @xmath78 , but of course not for the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 which enter the respective profile functions and which are ` gauge ' ( i.e. reparametrization)-dependent quantities .",
    "also the critical coupling at which real solutions ceased to exist was nearly identical in all three parametrizations .",
    "the similarity of the results for the different ans \" atze presumably indicates that these results are not too far away from the exact ones .",
    "we were not only able to determine the critical coupling but also to deduce qualitatively and quantitatively the width which the particle acquires beyond the critical coupling .",
    "this was achieved by finding _",
    "complex _ solutions of the variational equations first approximately by an analytic approach and then exactly by an iterative method which closely followed the analytic procedure .",
    "although the present approach does not describe tunneling ( which we expect to render the system unstable even at small coupling constants but with exponentially small width @xcite ) the polaron variational method is clearly superior to any perturbative treatment in this respect .",
    "we have concentrated mostly , although not exclusively , on the on - shell 2-point function , i.e. the nucleon propagator .",
    "this corresponds to the limit where the proper time goes towards infinity .",
    "it is possible , however , to go beyond the on - shell limit .",
    "this was necessary , for example , for the calculation of the residue of the 2-point function in section [ sec : resi ] . nevertheless , the residue is a quantity which is calculated at the pole and thus only requires off - shell information from an infinitesimal region around it .",
    "this has the effect that the variational parameters for the calculation of the residue are the same as the on - shell ones .",
    "as one moves a finite distance away from the pole the variational parameters themselves become a function of the off - shellness @xmath81 ( see section [ sec : var eq off mass shell ] ) .    in conclusion , we think that the present variational approach has yielded nonperturbative numerical results which look very reasonable and are encouraging . we therefore believe it worthwhile to try to extend it in several ways .",
    "first , in a sequel to this work we will generalize the present approach to the case with @xmath82 external mesons and thereby study physical processes like meson production or meson scattering from a nucleon .",
    "this can be done by employing the quadratic trial function whose parameters have been determined in the present work on the pole of the 2-point function .",
    "such a ` zeroth order ' calculation is similar in spirit to a quantum mechanical calculation in which wave functions determined from minimizing the energy functional are used to evaluate other observables .",
    "more demanding is the consistent ` first - order ' variational calculation of higher - order green functions as this requires the amputation of precisely the non - perturbative nucleon propagators which have been determined in the present work . that this is indeed possible",
    "will be demonstrated in another paper in this series .    of course",
    ", finally we would like to apply these non - perturbative techniques to theories which are of a more physical nature . among these",
    "one may mention scalar qed , the walecka model @xcite or qed .",
    "the latter two will require introduction of grassmann variables in order to deal with spin in a path integral .",
    "as such , this should not pose a fundamental problem",
    ". a greater challenge , however , is to extend such an approach beyond the quenched approximation or to nonabelian theories where the light degrees of freedom can not be integrated out analytically .",
    "* note added * + after completion of this work we became aware of the pioneering work by k. mano @xcite in which similar methods are applied to the wick - cutkosky model with zero meson mass .",
    "mano uses the proper time formulation , the quenched approximation and the feynman parametrization for the retardation function to derive a variational function for the self - energy of a scalar nucleon ( the expression following his eq .",
    "( 6.18 ) ) which is identical with our eq .",
    "( [ var inequality for mphys ] ) after proper identification of quantities is made .",
    "however , for minimizing the variational function mano sets ( in our nomenclature ) @xmath83 , expands to second order in @xmath84 and finds an instability of the ground state for @xmath85 . note that @xmath86 so that this translates into a critical coupling @xmath87 which is much smaller than the value which we obtain from the exact minimization .",
    "in addition , in the present work we consider non - zero meson masses , employ more general retardation functions , and calculate residue and width of the dressed particle .",
    "here we derive eq .",
    "( [ omega var expressed by g^2 ] ) for the kinetic term @xmath55 when the variational equations are fulfilled .",
    "we first perform an integration by parts in the definition ( [ omega by a(e ) ] ) of @xmath55 .",
