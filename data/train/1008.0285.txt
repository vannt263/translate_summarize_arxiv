    "wideband fading channels have been studied since the early 1960 s .",
    "kennedy showed that for the rayleigh fading channel at the infinite bandwidth limit , the capacity is similar to the capacity of the infinite bandwidth awgn channel with the same average received power [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "the robustness of this result in the case of with or without channel state information helps us model the low snr wideband wireless networks in a general manner .",
    "it should be noted that when the band grows large , the transmitting power is shared among large degrees of freedom .",
    "this results in smaller snr per degree of freedom . using this as our underlying information - theoretic assumption to approximate the capacity over a link , we model the general traffic for this network and show that the linearity of capacity for disappearing snr makes for the fundamental reason for simplicity in our model .",
    "hence , we claim , it is possible to do networking over such a model with simplistic and essentially linear approach .    in the context of wideband multipath fading relay channel , it was shown in [ 3 ] that in the non - coherent multipath fading relay channel , the same lower bound on the rate can be achieved as in the frequency division awgn relay channel with the same received snr , by using a peaky binning scheme . in this paper",
    ", we use a relaying scheme based on superposition coding .",
    "the rates achieved by peaky binning [ 3 ] are higher than the rates achieved by the relaying scheme that we propose",
    ". however , our relaying scheme has the advantage to extend easily to large networks due to hyperarc decomposability .",
    "we would like to mention here that number of hyperarcs for gaussian broadcast channel using superposition coding is equal to @xmath0 for @xmath0 receivers , instead of @xmath1 .",
    "the traffic model we use is quite general .",
    "it is divided into two classes : unicast and multicast ( broadcast is considered as a special case of multicast ) , where each pair of source and receiver group in the network form a session for a particular class of traffic . the problem of successfully establishing multicast connections in wireline or wireless networks has been long thought to be np - complete using arbitrary directed and undirected network models . with the advent of network coding ( ref .",
    ", [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] ) , and in turn breaking of the fluid model for data networks i.e. by performing coding over incoming packets , this approach has been able to intrinsically circumvent the combinatorial hardness of the multicast flow problem .",
    "it was also shown that establishing minimum cost multicast connections boils down to optimizing subgraph over coded packet networks [ 7 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a low snr wireless network with gaussian broadcast channel and mac .",
    "the problem we consider is to optimize the rates for a given set of demands that needs to be met by this network .",

    "the channel is given by : @xmath12 the capacity of the channel , for both gaussian channels and fading channels increase sublinearly with the increase in signal to noise ratio @xmath13 but in the low snr regime the capacity in the limit is linear in snr for fading and non - fading channels : @xmath14 clearly at low snr , the signal - to - noise ratio per degree of freedom ( snr ) approaches zero in the limit [ 2 , 8 , 9 ] .",
    "for such a case the point to point capacity boils down to : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the distance between the transmitter and receiver .",
