    "alfvn waves propagating in the solar atmosphere allow for energy transport from the chromosphere into the solar corona and wind , i.e. in the direction opposite to that of heat conduction .",
    "these waves have been suggested as a possible energy source for heating the solar corona and accelerating the solar wind @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that alfvnic perturbations are ubiquitous in the solar environment , and have been observed in the photosphere , chromosphere , in coronal structures , and in the solar wind at earth s orbit ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the poynting flux of chromospheric alfvn waves has been shown to be sufficiently large to drive both coronal heating and the solar wind @xcite . in order to account for coronal heating",
    ", these waves must undergo some sort of dissipation .",
    "several theoretical models of alfvn wave dissipation have been suggested .",
    "these include phase mixing @xcite , turbulent cascade @xcite , and resonant absorption @xcite . however , direct and conclusive observational evidence to support these theories is hard to obtain , due in part to the inherent uncertainty in remote sensing measurements , as we discuss below .",
    "extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) emission by heavy ions provides us with critical tools to study the physical properties and dynamic processes of coronal plasma .",
    "coronal abundances of ions heavier than helium are low , and therefore these elements do not affect the overall dynamics , but nevertheless their emission in selected spectral lines is routinely observed by spaceborne observatories .",
    "while the total line flux depends mainly on the electron density and temperature , the line width is related to the state of the ion responsible for the emission .",
    "specifically , unresolved motions will give rise to doppler broadening of the spectral line .",
    "there are two mechanisms that dominate line broadening in the solar corona : thermal ion motions ( due to their finite temperature ) , and non - thermal ion motions . non - thermal motions of coronal ions have been suggested to be due to transverse alfvn waves ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have reported on observational evidence that non - thermal line broadenings are correlated with alfvnic oscillations .",
    "non - thermal line broadening may also be associated with high speed flows taking place in nano - flares @xcite . in this work",
    "we study spectral lines formed in the quiet sun , and therefore we do not address the contribution of this mechanism to the line width .",
    "measuring non - thermal mass motions is a difficult endeavor , since both ion temperatures and the non - thermal motions contribute to the observed line width and therefore some assumptions need to be made on the former in order to measure the latter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite studied the observed line broadening in a coronal hole , and found evidence of wave damping . despite many efforts , direct observational evidence of wave damping in the equatorial corona remain inconclusive .",
    "this may be attributed to line - of - sight effects , whereby different spectral lines are actually emitted from different regions .",
    "several numerical models were aimed at simulating alfvnic perturbations in the solar corona and predicting the observed non - thermal motions .",
    "@xcite generated alfvn waves in a 2.5d resistive magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model of an idealized coronal hole . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "this work was extended to a multi - fluid description in order to directly simulate the motions of the emitting ion species due to a broad band alfvn wave spectrum injected at the base .",
    "they directly calculated the resulting line - broadening and found it to agree well with observations .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented results from test - particle simulations showing that a maxwellian distribution of ion speeds will be broadened when subjected to alfvn waves .",
    "they found that the maxwellian shape is more likely to be preserved during this process when acted on by a wave - spectrum , compared to a monochromatic wave .",
    "while these efforts allowed for a detailed description of wave - induced motions , they were restricted to prescribed and idealized magnetic fields . in this work ,",
    "we wish to extend these efforts to a global model , in which the magnetic field evolves self - consistently with the plasma and wave field , and whose topology can be derived from synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "this allows us to predict euv line widths and compare them to observations at any location in the lower corona .",
    "several mhd models based on synoptic maps have been developed @xcite .",
    "these earlier models employed geometric or empirical heating functions in order to mimic the observed plasma heating and wind acceleration rates , and set their lower boundary at the already hot ( @xmath0 1mk ) corona . @xcite and @xcite were the first global models which set the inner boundary at the top of the chromosphere .",
    "they were able to reproduce the large scale features of the lower corona as observed in full - disk euv images by introducing different geometric heating functions in coronal holes , streamer belts and active regions . however , global models based on empirical heating functions are limited by the fact that the energy source itself does not evolve self - consistently with the plasma .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the alfv speed profiles predicted by such models were less consistent with observations compared to idealized wave - driven models .",
    "a self - consistent description of the heating and acceleration in the solar atmosphere can be incorporated into an mhd model by including the effects of alfvn waves , which exchange energy and momentum with the plasma through wave dissipation and wave pressure gradients , respectively .",
    "alfvn waves were first included in a 3d mhd model of the solar corona in @xcite , and later in @xcite , assuming an ideal dipole magnetic field .",
    "these models solved the mhd equations coupled to the wave - kinetic equation for low - frequency alfvn waves of a single polarity , undergoing linear dissipation .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of the dissipation mechanism was implemented in the global model of @xcite , which assumed that a kolmogorov - type non - linear dissipation is taking place in open field line regions , based on the description proposed in @xcite .",
    "this model was validated in @xcite , and later extended to include surface alfvn waves in @xcite .",
    "however , the inner boundary of this model was set at the bottom of the corona with temperatures in the @xmath01mk range , thus avoiding the problem of forming the corona from the much cooler chromosphere .    in this work",
    "we use the recently developed alfvn wave solar model ( awsom ) @xcite , a global model of the solar atmosphere driven by alfvn wave energy , which is propagated and dissipated in both open and closed magnetic field lines .",
    "the model extends from the top of the chromosphere and up to 1 - 2au .",
    "the interaction of the plasma with the wave field is described by coupling the extended - mhd equations to wave kinetic equations of low - frequency alfvn waves propagating parallel and anti - parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "wave dissipation due to a turbulent cascade is the only heating mechanism assumed in the model .",
    "the wave energy in this description represents the time - average of the perturbations due to a turbulent spectrum of alfvn waves . relating this energy to the non - thermal line broadening , and combining the 3d model results with a spectroscopic database , we are able to calculate synthetic emission line profiles integrated along the entire line - of - sight .",
    "the synthetic spectra are used in two ways : first , we compare the synthetic line widths to observations in order to test the accuracy of the model predictions of the alfvn wave amplitude and ion temperatures .",
    "second , the synthetic and observed total line fluxes are compared , in order to test the accuracy of the model predictions of electron density and temperature .",
    "in addition , we directly compare the model electron density and temperature to remote measurements based on line intensity ratios . for this purpose",
    ", we perform a careful analysis of the emission along the sumer line of sight as predicted by the model , in order to locate the region that is responsible for the relevant line emission .",
    "this series of independent observational tests allows us to examine whether we can simultaneously account for the coronal plasma heating rate , together with the amount of remaining ( non - dissipated ) wave energy .",
    "such a comparison provides a vital benchmark for the scenario where coronal heating is due to alfvn wave dissipation . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that observed non - thermal mass motions are used to test the heating mechanism in a three - dimensional global model . in the particular case of the awsom model , an agreement between the model results and observations would suggest that both the amount of wave energy injected into the system ( i.e. the poynting flux from the chromosphere ) and the rate at which the wave energy dissipates at higher altitudes , are consistent with observations .    in order to make meaningful comparisons to observations , we require high quality , high spatial and high spectral resolution data .",
    "we selected a set of observations carried out by the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) instrument on board soho @xcite during 21 - 22 november , 1996 , in which the sumer slit was oriented along the solar east - west direction and the sumer field of view stretched radially from 1.04 to 1.34 solar radii outside the west limb .",
    "the awsom model was used to create a steady - state simulation for carrington rotation 1916 ( 11 nov . -",
    "1996 ) , from which we produced synthetic spectra in selected sumer lines .",
    "the radial orientation of the slit allows us to compare predicted and observed quantities as a function of distance from the limb .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s : nonther ]",
    "we discuss thermal and non - thermal line broadening of optically thin emission lines . in section [",
    "s : model ] , we briefly describe the awsom model and the numerical simulation for cr1916 . the observations used in this study are introduced in section [ s : observations ] .",
    "we describe the method of creating synthetic emission line profiles in section [ s : synth ] .",
    "section [ s : results ] reports on the resulting line profiles and their comparison to observations ; comparison of the model results to electron density and temperature diagnostics is also shown , and the wave dissipation in the observed region is analyzed .",
    "we discuss the results and their implications in section [ s : discussion ] .",
    "unresolved thermal and non - thermal motions of ions will cause emission lines associated with these ions to exhibit doppler broadening .",
    "outside active regions , the resulting line profile can be approximated by a gaussian , whose width depends on both the thermal and non - thermal speeds . in the most general case where the non - thermal motions are assumed to be random , the observed full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of an optically thin emission line will be given by @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the instrumental broadening , @xmath3 is the rest wavelength , @xmath4 the speed of light , @xmath5 the boltzmann constant , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the temperature and atomic mass of ion @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath9 is the non - thermal speed along the line - of - sight .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltalam ] ) that one can not determine the separate contributions of thermal and non - thermal motions from the observed fwhm alone . instead",
    ", one must either make some assumption about the ion temperatures or use some model that describes and predicts the magnitude of @xmath9 . in this work , we take a different approach , in which we predict both the ion temperatures , @xmath6 , and the non - thermal speed , @xmath9 at every location along the line of sight from a global model of the solar atmosphere , and compare the resulting spectra to observations . for this purpose",
    "we assume that the non - thermal motions of coronal ions are due to transverse alfvn waves , which cause the ions to move with a velocity equal to the waves velocity perturbation , @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the non - thermal speed can be determined according to @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes an average over time scales much larger than the wave period , and @xmath13 is the angle that the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field makes with the line of sight vector .",
    "( [ eq : vnt ] ) shows that the non - thermal speed is related to the root mean square ( rms ) of the velocity perturbation rather than to the instantaneous vector .",
    "this is due to the fact that line broadening is associated with unresolved motions whose periods are much smaller than the integration time of the detector .",
    "the dependence on @xmath13 reflects the fact that the non - thermal motions due to alfvn waves are inherently anisotropic .",
    "the vector @xmath10 lies in a plane perpendicular to the background magnetic field , and only its component along the line - of - sight contributes to the doppler broadening of the emission .",
    "this dependence on the magnetic field topology is often neglected in works involving coronal holes , but it must be taken into account when considering the equatorial solar corona .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 can be calculated from a wave - driven model of the solar corona which describes the evolution of the wave field coupled to an mhd plasma self - consistently . in order to calculate the ion temperatures in detail ,",
    "one in principle should use a multi - species / multi - fluid mhd description ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an approach to a global model of the solar atmosphere is quite involved and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , an extended - mhd description which includes separate electron and proton temperatures might be sufficient , if one assumes that the ions are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the protons",
    ". this assumption can be reasonable in the equatorial lower corona due to the high density .",
    "thus , a model that allows the calculation of both the wave amplitude and the proton temperature should be capable of predicting the line broadening under the assumptions we just stated .",
    "the alfvn wave solar model ( awsom ) is a global , wave - driven , extended - mhd numerical model starting from the top of the chromosphere and extending into the heliosphere beyond earth s orbit .",
    "the model is based on bats - r - us , a versatile , massively parallel mhd code , and is implemented within the space weather modeling framework ( swmf ) @xcite .",
    "the computational domain is based on a non - uniform spherical grid which allows us to treat the sharp gradients in the transition region as well as resolve the heliospheric current sheet .",
    "the model employs a unified approach for treating turbulent dissipation in both open and closed magnetic field lines , as presented in @xcite .",
    "awsom was described in detail and validated in @xcite .",
    "the model solves the mhd equations coupled to wave - kinetic equations for low - frequency alfvn waves propagating parallel and anti - parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this allows for the exchange of energy and momentum between the wave field and the plasma .",
    "separate pressure equations for electrons and protons allow the inclusion of non - ideal mhd processes such as electron heat conduction , radiative cooling and electron - proton heat exchange .",
    "for the sake of brevity we will not repeat the full set of governing equations here and refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile , however , to briefly discuss the wave dissipation mechanism , since it is the only heating mechanism assumed in the model and it controls the magnitude of the alfvnic perturbations considered in this work .",
    "the model assumes that a poynting flux of alfvn waves is emitted from the top of the chromosphere , with a magnitude proportional to the local magnetic field and constrained by observations ( see table [ t : params ] ) .",
    "the polarity of the wave emitted from each point on the inner boundary is determined by the direction of the local radial magnetic field .",
    "the wave energy densities , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , associated with parallel and anti - parallel propagating waves , respectively , are then advected outward along magnetic field lines and dissipated due to a fully developed turbulent cascade @xcite .",
    "the energy density dissipation , @xmath17 , is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the plasma mass density .",
    "the dissipation mechanism is controlled by two adjustable parameters : a constant pseudo - reflection coefficient , @xmath20 , and the transverse correlation length for alfvnic turbulence , @xmath21 , which varies with the width of the magnetic flux tube such that @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "note that the dissipation depends on the relative magnitudes of the two wave polarities , leading to different heating rates in open and closed field lines .",
    "this unified approach , presented in @xcite , ensures that the spatial distribution of coronal heating rates will emerge automatically and self - consistently with the magnetic field topology",
    ". a detailed analysis of this approach and its implications can be found in @xcite .",
    "the total dissipated wave energy , @xmath23 , heats both protons and electrons , with 60% of the heating going into the protons ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "it is important to note that reflections are not directly simulated by the model , rather the pseudo - reflection coefficient @xmath20 serves to mimic their effect under the assumption of a fully - developed turbulent cascade . in this approximation",
    "any wave energy created by reflections is dissipated locally by the cascade process before it can be carried away by the reflected wave @xcite .",
    "thus in practice there is no need to convert the outgoing wave energy into the opposite polarity , as the wave energy is converted into heat .",
    "a less restrictive treatment that includes a self - consistent description of wave reflections in a global model was implemented in @xcite .      in the awsom model",
    "the wave energy evolves under the wkb approximation .",
    "the perturbations due to alfvn waves propagating parallel and anti - parallel to the background magnetic field can be conveniently described by the elssser variables , defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath10 and @xmath25 are the velocity and magnetic field perturbations , respectively , and @xmath26 is the permeability of free space .",
    "the wave energy densities can be expressed as @xmath27 , while the square of the velocity perturbation can be obtained from : @xmath28 on open field lines , only one wave polarity should dominate if the reflection is negligible so that the product @xmath29 will be zero . on closed field lines ,",
    "opposite wave polarities are injected at the two foot points of the field line , giving rise to counter - propagating waves . however , in the balanced turbulent regime near the top of the closed field lines these perturbations are presumed to be uncorrelated : @xmath30 .",
    "thus the last term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zzave ] ) will drop out in any magnetic topology .",
    "the square of the velocity perturbation now becomes : @xmath31 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vnt ] ) and ( [ eq : zzave2 ] ) we can relate the thermal speed to the wave energies as : @xmath32 note that under the wkb approximation , the wave energy density is already an average over time scales much larger than the wave period and there is no need for averaging .      in order to produce a realistic steady - state solution for the period during which the sumer observations were taken ,",
    "we derive the inner boundary conditions of the model using a synoptic line - of - sight magnetogram of the photospheric radial magnetic field , acquired during carrington rotation ( cr ) 1916 ( lasting from 11-nov-1996 to 9-dec-1996 ) .",
    "the magnetogram was obtained by the michelson - doppler interferometer ( mdi ) instrument on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) spacecraft @xcite . in order to compensate for the reduced accuracy at polar regions , we use a polar - interpolated synoptic magnetogram , provided by the solar oscillations investigation ( soi ) team @xcite .",
    "the resulting radial magnetic field is shown in figure [ f:1916_br ] .",
    "the values used for the model s adjustable parameters and inner boundary conditions for this simulation are listed in table [ t : params ] .",
    "these values were chosen in accordance with those used for the awsom model for a solar minimum case in oran et al.,(2013 ) , who validated the resulting solution against a myriad of observations , from the lower corona to interplanetary space at 2au .",
    "the use of the same values for carrington rotation 1916 , which also took place during solar minimum , is therefore reasonable .",
    "nonetheless , we verify the validity of the global solution used here by comparing model results to full - disk images in section [ s : valid ] .",

    "the data were averaged along the slit direction in 30 bins , each 0.01  r@xmath33 wide .",
    "spectral line profiles were fitted with a gaussian curve removing a linear background .",
    "the resulting count rates were then calibrated using the standard sumer calibration also available in solarsoft .",
    "the accuracy of the spectral flux calibration of sumer detector  b before june 1998 is @xmath3420% ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the micro - roughness of the sumer optics causes the instrument to scatter the radiation coming from the solar disk into the detector , even when the instrument is pointing outside the limb .",
    "the scattered light forms a ghost spectrum of the solar disk at rest wavelength superimposed onto the actual spectrum emitted by the region imaged by the sumer slit .",
    "this ghost spectrum can provide important , though undesired , contributions to measured line fluxes when the local emission of the sun is weak ; these contributions need to be evaluated and , when necessary , removed .",
    "unfortunately , the strength of the ghost spectrum depends on a number of factors ( slit pointing , strength of the disk spectrum etc . ) which make it impossible to devise a procedure to automatically remove it from the observations ; its estimation needs to be performed on a case - by - case basis .    in the case of the present observations ,",
    "the almost radial pointing of the sumer slit allows us to use the rate of decrease of spectral line intensities with distance from the limb in order to determine an upper limit on the contributions of the ghost spectrum .",
    "since emission line intensities depend on the square of the electron density , the rapid decrease of the latter with height causes the coronal line intensities to decrease by almost two orders of magnitude from the closest to the farthest end of the slit in the present observation ; on the contrary , the scattered light intensity , which is not emitted by the plasma in the observed region , is only reduced by a factor @xmath35 over the same range .",
    "@xcite devised a two - step method to determine an upper limit of the scattered light contribution to any spectral line for off - disk observations stretching over a large range of distances from the limb .",
    "first , the rate of decrease of the scattered light intensity with height is determined , based on several lines that are not emitted by the corona and whose off - disk intensity is entirely due to scattering .",
    "second , the rate of decrease of scattered light intensity is used to get an upper limit on its contribution to a specific coronal line as follows .",
    "we measure the intensity of the coronal line at the location farthest from the limb in the instrument s field of view , and assume that this intensity is entirely due to scattered light",
    ". the radial rate of decrease of the scattered light intensity is then normalized to match that coronal line intensity at the same height , giving an upper limit to the scattered light contribution at all other heights .",
    "note that this method actually overestimates the scattered light contribution to coronal lines .    to estimate the radial rate of decrease of scattered light intensity",
    ", we have used the intensity of the continuum at 1475   , and of the following lines : he i 584   , c ii 1335   , c iii 977   , o i 1032   , 1304    and 1306   , o iii 835   , and si iii 1206   .",
    "these lines and continuum are emitted by the solar chromosphere , so that they are expected to be too weak to be observed at the heights covered by the sumer field of view : their observed intensity is entirely due to scattered light .",
    "the rate of decrease of each of these lines and continuum have been normalized to the value of the intensity at the largest distance from the limb and averaged together to provide the final scattered light intensity vs. height curve .",
    "this curve appears as the solid black curve in figure [ f : stray ] .",
    "the normalized intensity vs. height curve for the lines in table [ t : lines ] are also shown for comparison .",
    "we verified that all of them decreased at a rate much larger than the scattered light intensity : this suggests that the latter is at best a minor contributor to the intensity of each of the lines in table [ t : lines ] .",
    "we also determined the maximum heliocentric distance r@xmath36 below which the scattered light contribution to the coronal line intensity is less than 50% .",
    "we take this arbitrary limit as an indication of the range of heights where we can safely neglect the scattered light .",
    "this height is reported in the third column of table [ t : lines ] .",
    "we note that all the emission lines considered here possessed a clear gaussian line shape that could be separated from the background up to distances larger than r@xmath36 .",
    "the synthetic line profiles have been calculated by combining the awsom model predictions of the plasma properties and wave energy with the spectral emissivity calculated from the chianti 7.1 atomic database @xcite .",
    "chianti takes into account known line formation mechanisms and is capable of calculating the total emission of a spectral line , given the electron density and temperature .",

    "the atomic data from @xcite in chianti 7.1 include improved atomic data for this ion , but inaccuracies in the predicted flux of this line may still be expected ; in particular , @xcite found that the atomic data in chianti 3 underestimated the predicted flux by @xmath7130% while the chianti 7.1 predicted fluxes are decreased by a factor 1.5 - 2 compared to version 3 levels .",

    "the simple geometry of the coronal hole allowed the authors to compare the line - of - sight measurements to model results extracted along the coronal hole axis .",
    "however , in the present case of observations of the equatorial quiet corona , which exhibits a more complex magnetic topology , it becomes less clear which region along the line - of - sight should be compared to the measurements .",
    "we therefore adopt a more detailed approach , one that takes into account the variable emission from different magnetic structures crossing the line - of - sight .",
    "the advantage of a three - dimensional model is that it enables us , when combined with the chianti atomic database , to calculate the relative contribution of each emitting volume along the line - of - sight to the total observed emission using the calculations presented in section [ s : synth ] .",

    "if a single , well - defined magnetic structure can be identified as a major source of the emission in these lines , then the corresponding modeled quantity in that structure may be compared to the measurement results .",
    "we must also require that the relative contribution of this region to the total emission is the same for each of the lines used in the flux ratio calculation .",
    "in this way , the ratio of the line fluxes integrated over the selected region will be equal to the ratio of line fluxes integrated over the entire line - of - sight , making the comparison to the observations appropriate .",

    "<S> in the present work , we test the predictions of the awsom model , a global extended - mhd model capable of calculating the propagation and turbulent dissipation of alfvn waves in any magnetic topology , against high resolution spectra of the quiescent off - disk solar corona . </S>",
    "<S> wave dissipation is the only heating mechanism assumed in this model . combining 3d model results with the chianti atomic database </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to create synthetic line - of - sight spectra which include the effects of emission line broadening due to both thermal and wave - related non - thermal motions . </S>",
    "<S> to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a global model is used to obtain synthetic non - thermal line broadening . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a steady - state solution driven by a synoptic magnetogram and compared the synthetic spectra with sumer observations of a quiescent area above the solar west limb extending between 1.04 and 1.34 solar radii at the equator . </S>",
    "<S> both the predicted line widths and the total line fluxes were consistent with the observations for 5 different ions . </S>",
    "<S> using the 3d solution , we were able to locate the region that contributes the most to the emission used for measuring electron properties ; we found that region to be a pseudo - streamer , whose modeled electron temperature and density are consistent with the measured ones . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the turbulent dissipation assumed in the awsom model can simultaneously account for the observed heating rate and the non - dissipated wave energy observed in this region . </S>"
