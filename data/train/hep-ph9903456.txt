    ", the decay @xmath13 usually appears as a tool to determine @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately , penguin contributions are expected to affect this determination severely @xcite .",
    "although there are several strategies on the market to take care of these penguin uncertainties @xcite , they are usually very challenging from an experimental point of view . in this paper ,",
    "a new way of making use of the cp - violating observables of the decay @xmath13 is proposed .",
    "combining them with those of the mode @xmath1 , a simultaneous determination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 becomes possible .",
    "the decays @xmath13 and @xmath1 are related to each other by interchanging all down and strange quarks , i.e.  through the so - called `` @xmath2-spin '' subgroup of the @xmath10 flavour symmety of strong interactions .",
    "the utility of @xmath1 to probe @xmath4 was already pointed out in several previous publications @xcite . the new strategy proposed here",
    "is not affected by penguin topologies  it rather makes use of them  and does not rely on certain `` plausible '' dynamical or model - dependent assumptions .",
    "moreover , final - state interaction effects @xcite , which led to considerable attention in the recent literature in the context of the determination of @xmath4 from @xmath15 decays @xcite , do not lead to any problems , and the theoretical accuracy is only limited by @xmath2-spin - breaking effects .",
    "a conceptually quite similar strategy to extract @xmath4 using @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays was recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath4 is a crucial element in the test of the standard model description of cp violation . in particular",
    ", this angle should be measured in a variety of ways to check whether one finds the same result consistently . during the recent years , several methods to accomplish this task",
    "were developed @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath18 @xmath11-factories operating at the @xmath19 resonance will not be in a position to explore @xmath20 decays , a strong emphasis was given to decays of non - strange @xmath11 mesons .",
    "however , also the @xmath20 system provides interesting strategies to determine @xmath4 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in order to make use of these methods , dedicated @xmath11-physics experiments at hadron machines , such as lhcb , are the natural place .",
    "the @xmath20 system exhibits several peculiar features . within the standard model , the weak @xmath21@xmath22",
    "mixing phase is very small , and studies of @xmath20 decays involve very rapid @xmath21@xmath22 oscillations , which are due to the large mass difference @xmath23 between the mass eigenstates @xmath24 ( `` heavy '' ) and @xmath25 ( `` light '' )",
    ". future @xmath11-physics experiments at hadron machines should be in a position to resolve these oscillations .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath26 case , there may be a sizeable width difference @xmath27 between the @xmath20 mass eigenstates @xcite , which may allow studies of cp violation with `` untagged '' @xmath20 data samples , where one does not distinguish between initially , i.e.  at time @xmath28 , present @xmath29 or @xmath22 mesons @xcite .",
    "in such untagged rates , the rapid @xmath21@xmath22 oscillations cancel .",
    "there are a few theoretically clean strategies to determine @xmath4 , making use of pure `` tree '' decays , for example of @xmath30 or @xmath31 modes .",
    "since no flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes contribute to the corresponding decay amplitudes , it is quite unlikely that they  and the extracted value of @xmath4  are affected significantly by new physics .",
    "in contrast , the strategies discussed in this paper rely on interference effects between `` tree '' and `` penguin '' , i.e.  fcnc , processes . therefore , new physics may well show up in the corresponding decay amplitudes , thereby affecting the cp - violating observables and the extracted value of @xmath4 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ obs ] , a completely general parametrization of the @xmath13 and @xmath1 decay amplitudes , as well as of the corresponding cp - violating observables , is given within the standard model .",
    "the strategies to determine @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the help of these observables are discussed in section  [ bet - gam - det ] , where also an approach , which uses @xmath9 instead of @xmath1 and relies  in addition to the @xmath10 flavour symmetry  on a certain dynamical assumption , is briefly discussed . in section",

    "although ( [ d - approx ] ) is a simplified expression , which may be affected by non - factorizable contributions , it strengthens our confidence into  ( [ uspin - rel ] ) .",
    "unless such non - factorizable effects have a dramatic impact , the @xmath2-spin - breaking corrections to this relation are probably moderate .    before giving the conclusions in the following section ,",
    "let us emphasize again that the strategies illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : acpdir ] and [ fig : acpmix ] rely on ( [ uspin - rel ] ) , i.e.  both on ( [ rel1 ] ) and ( [ rel2 ] ) , whereas the extraction of @xmath4 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] makes only use of ( [ rel2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the solid and dot - dashed contours in this figure are _ theoretically clean_. using ( [ d - approx ] ) , we obtain values for @xmath62 and @xmath85 of the same order of magnitude as those employed in the example given in the previous section .",
    "the time evolutions of the decays @xmath13 and @xmath1 provide interesting strategies to extract the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the unitarity triangle of the ckm matrix .",
    "these methods , which make use of `` penguin '' topologies and are therefore not affected by their presence , take into account final - state interaction effects `` automatically '' .",
    "moreover , they do not rely on any model - dependent or `` plausible '' dynamical assumptions , and their theoretical accuracy is only limited by @xmath2-spin - breaking corrections . within a certain model - dependent approach making use  among other things  of `` factorization '' to estimate the relevant hadronic matrix elements , these @xmath2-spin - breaking corrections vanish .",
    "although this approach is very simplified and may be affected by non - factorizable effects , it strengthens our confidence into the @xmath2-spin relations used for the extraction of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the decays @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , an interesting relation between the cp - averaged branching ratios of these modes and the corresponding direct cp asymmetries may provide valuable experimental insights into @xmath2-spin breaking .",
    "if the @xmath5@xmath6 mixing phase @xmath53 is fixed through @xmath54 , certain theoretically clean contours can be determined with the help of the cp - violating @xmath13 and @xmath1 observables , allowing the extraction of @xmath4 with a reduced @xmath2-spin flavour symmetry input . since both @xmath190 and @xmath69 `` penguin '' , i.e.  fcnc , processes contribute to the @xmath13 and @xmath1 decay amplitudes , the extracted value of @xmath4 may well be affected by new physics . in such a case , discrepancies would show up with the values of @xmath4 determined from pure `` tree '' decays , for example from @xmath31 modes .",
    "possible new - physics contributions to @xmath21@xmath22 mixing can be probed through @xmath191 , and can also be taken into account with the help of this decay . a similar comment applies to the @xmath5@xmath6 mixing phase @xmath158 . if new physics should shift @xmath158 from its standard model value , it could still be fixed through the `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath54 .",
    "the strategies proposed in this paper are very interesting for `` second - generation '' @xmath11-physics experiments performed at hadron machines , for example lhcb , where the very interesting physics potential of the @xmath20 system can be fully exploited . at the asymmetric @xmath18 @xmath11-factories operating at the @xmath19 resonance , which will start taking data very soon ,",
    "this is unfortunately not possible .",
    "however , there is also a variant of the strategy to determine @xmath4 , where @xmath9 is used instead of @xmath1 .",
    "this approach has the advantage that all required time - dependent measurements can in principle be performed at the asymmetric @xmath18 machines . on the other hand ,",
    "it relies  in addition to the @xmath10 flavour symmetry  on the smallness of certain `` exchange '' and `` penguin annihilation '' topologies , which may be enhanced by final - state - interaction effects .",
    "consequently , its theoretical accuracy can not compete with the `` second - generation '' @xmath13 , @xmath1 approach , which is not affected by such problems .              for reviews ,",
