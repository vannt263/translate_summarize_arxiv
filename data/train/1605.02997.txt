    "<S> we perform simulations around the phase transition point with the lattice size in the temporal direction @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 and extrapolate the results to the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the spatial volume dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density and pressure are evaluated by the derivative method with non - perturabative anisotropy coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a multi - point reweighting method to determine the anisotropy coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the anisotropy coefficients approach the perturbative values as @xmath3 increases . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pressure gap vanishes at all values of @xmath3 when the non - perturbative anisotropy coefficients are used . the spatial volume dependence in the latent heat is found to be small on large lattices . </S>",
    "<S> performing extrapolation to the continuum limit , we obtain @xmath4 and @xmath5 </S>"
