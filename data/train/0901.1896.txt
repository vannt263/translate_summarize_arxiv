    "such objects are rather `` normal '' at optical wavelengths ( spectroscopically and photometrically ) but they stand out in the observed uv range , having fuv - nuv colors similar to those of hot white dwarfs ( wd ) .",
    "photometrically , these objects have uv - to - optical colors similar to a stellar binary containing a hot wd and a cooler companion . that a significant number of `` fuv - nuv''-blue extragalactic objects existed was first suspected by bianchi et al .",

    "however , the density of objects with similarly blue uv color but redder optical colors , that we would expect to be hot wds with a cool companion , increases considerably at fainter magnitudes , suggesting that a significant number of faint extragalactic objects may be included in the color - color _ locus _ of these stellar binaries ( bianchi et al .",

    "we focus on these qsos , which display very blue observed fuv - nuv colors , and investigate whether their properties are unlike those of known objects .",

    "the requirement of available sdss spectroscopy effectively limits the sample to brighter magnitudes , but it provides a classification and useful information , which will help interpreting larger samples of photometric candidates .",
    "such relatively bright objects will also be accessible to the spectroscopic capabilities of the refurbished hst , and to other follow - up observations .",

    "we will use here the generic term `` qso '' to reflect our selection criterion from the sdss spectroscopic database .",
    "it is important to note that spectroscopic targets in the sdss were selected with criteria unrelated to our present objective and therefore our uv - blue spectroscopically confirmed qsos may be a biased sub - sample among the uv - blue qso photometric candidates .",
    "these selection criteria produced an initial sample of 174 objects .",
    "one additional object was excluded because its u - band measurement is saturated .",

    "it is shown in some figures because it is interesting to note its position in the color - color diagrams ( figs [ f_ccd ] and [ f_ccd2 ] ) : the galex photometry clearly place this object on the stellar sequence and not as a qso candidate .",

    "the sdss optical spectra ( range @xmath3 3800 - 9200 , resolution @xmath31800 ) , provide the initial classification as qsos and a measure of redshift for the objects .",
    "our sample includes a group of 151 objects at low redshift ( 0.041@xmath0z@xmath0 0.436 ) , and 21 objects with redshift between 1.7 and 2.6 , all pointlike .",
    "only one object has intermediate redshift ( z=0.93 ) and its identification as a qso is dubious .",
    "it has fairly large photometric errors : fuv=21.49@xmath80.12 , nuv=21.43@xmath80.10 , but the typical qso fuv - nuv color at this redshift is much redder ( by @xmath91 mag , see fig .",
    "[ f_ccd ] ) ; therefore if it is a qso it would be quite anomalous . at this redshift",
    "the galex bands sample rest wavelengths of @xmath31300(nuv ) and @xmath3800(fuv ) , and a very blue fuv - nuv color would be not expected . the image and spectrum of this object",

    "the spectrum shows one emission line that is identified as mgii for the alleged redshift and possibly a few absorptions including one at the red end that could be h@xmath10 .",

    "so , either z=0.93 is right or perhaps the emission is some artifact in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , we consider this object doubtful and do not include it in our analysis .",
    "the lack of objects between redshift 0.5 and 1.7 is consistent with our selection of very blue fuv - nuv color , because ly@xmath1 is in the nuv band between z=0.48 and z=1.63 , causing brighter flux in nuv and consequently much redder fuv - nuv color , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f_ccd ] .",
    "we also caution that while the galex fuv and nuv images are taken simultaneously , the sdss imaging was taken at a different time from the galex observations , therefore any significant variability may affect the combined uv and optical colors , such as nuv - r . for this reason we based our initial sample selection on the fuv - nuv color only .",
    "some of our targets have repeated observations with galex , but most repeated measurements are from the ais ( all - sky imaging survey ) , which has about 10 times shorter exposures than mis ( used in this work ) and therefore large photometric uncertainties . in a few cases repeated measurements",
    "are discrepant by @xmath92@xmath11 in the combined photometric errors : however most of the discrepant measurements have artifact flags set .",
    "we compile for completeness all repeated measurements with exposures longer than 400  sec and formally discrepant by @xmath92@xmath11 in table [ t_dup ] , where we provide also comments that help assess reliability , based on the flags from the pipeline photometry , and our visual inspection of the images .",
    "we only excluded measurements on the very edge of the galex field ( flag `` rim '' ) however we did not apply error cuts nor area cut , for the purpose of an exhaustive comparison , while our analysis sample is restricted to measurements in the central 0.5  deg .",

    "2 ) . in a few cases",
    "the discrepancies in the repeated measurements can not be ascribed to artifacts , and these objects may deserve dedicated follow - up photometry . in some cases",
    "the variation affects the fuv - nuv color , and in particular some repeated measurements have redder fuv - nuv than our initially selected dataset .",
    "all discrepant repeated measurements with mis exposures ( 2 high - redshift objects and 10 low - redshift objects ) have fuv - nuv@xmath90.1 . if we consider also ais data ( exposure times @xmath3 100  sec ) , we find 55 additional repeated measurements discrepant by @xmath92  @xmath11 , of which 36 give fuv - nuv redder than our selected dataset ( mis measurements ) , and other 19 bluer .",
    "fast variability is not unknown in qsos , and in particular line strength may vary on short time scales , while it would be less plausible for dust effects to change rapidly .",
    "we stress that a variabilty assessment however would require custom photometry , and while the standard pipeline photometry is good for statistical analysis , such as the scope of this work , we should refrain from overinterpreting individual measurements and individual variations .",
    "other 72 ais and 7 mis repeated measurements agree within 2@xmath11 with our selected measurements given in table 1 .",
    "one object in the initial sample , although part of the mis survey , has a 40  sec exposure in fuv and 1518  sec in nuv : although its fuv error ( 0.23 ) meets our selection limits , a longer mis exposure of 853  sec in both fuv and nuv and smaller errors gives fuv - nuv=0.17 , so it is eliminated from our analysis sample .",
    "a larger sample of about 30,000 qsos candidates with `` normal '' fuv - nuv colors ( i.e. similar to the standard template ) , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we will refer to this sample as `` uv - normal '' in the discussion of the uv - blue sample for comparison purposes .",
    "of the 174 sample objects , 64 sources are classified as point - like ( at the resolution of the sdss imaging , @xmath31.4@xmath12 ) and 110 as extended ( all at low redshift ) , by the sdss pipeline .",
    "we will keep the pipeline classification because it is derived from an objective procedure , although the result depends on the contrast between central source and underlying galaxy .",
    "galex and sdss imaging for a subsample of objects , presented in fig .",
    "[ f_fchart_new ] , shows that the definition of `` pointlike '' ( p ) or `` extended '' ( e ) is not clear - cut .",

    "of the 64 point - like sources , 42/33 have errors less than 0.1  mag/0.05  mag , and only 4 have errors between 0.2 and 0.3  mag , in fuv . as for the nuv measurements ,",

    "we point out that the object galex j113223.4 + 641958 ( sdss j113223.42 + 641958.4 ) has a u - band magnitude of 28.7@xmath80.46 ( petromag ) while the magnitude listed on the explorer page for this object is u=25.07@xmath83.05 .",

    "[ f_ccd ] and [ f_ccd2 ] . while they have synthetic fuv - nuv color bluer than the canonical template at redshift @xmath3 2 , they are still more than half magnitude redder than the colors observed in our uv - blue sample .",
    "the fact suggests that a combination of both euv flux rise at shorter wavelengths and a deep absorption below the lyman limit may be required to explain the observed colors of our uv - blue qsos .",
    "the suggestion is supported by fig .",
    "[ f_mags ] , showing the absolute nuv luminosity of our uv - blue sample to be lower than average .",
    "this can also be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ f_jh1 ] which shows all the observed magnitudes for our high - redshift sample .",
    "the lyman limit in this redshift range lies between the nuv and u bands , and the lyman drop is clearly seen .",
    "the line shows the median values , and only the object with a red optical spectrum mentioned above differs significantly ( shown by the dotted line ) .",
    "figure [ f_jh1 ] also shows the median magnitudes for uv - normal qsos from the mis survey , with the same redshift range and error cuts .",
    "the average fuv - nuv is much ` redder ' for the uv - normal qsos , consistent with our selection .",
    "the uv - blue qsos are fainter in the nuv band , which is sampling the lyman limit at these redshifts .",
    "thus , our qsos sample may have somewhat more extinction and more severe absorption below the lyman limit .",
    "three of the uv - blue qsos have strong bal - type c iv absorption ( fig . [ f_sp_hiz ] ) .",
    "their lyman discontinuities ( estimated from the broad - band photometry , as defined in fig.[f_jh2 ] ) are very large for two of them and smaller than average for one .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether bal absorbers contribute signifcantly to the lyman drop .",
    "binette & krongold ( 2008 , and references therein ) discuss the spectrum of ton  34 , an unusual qso with an enhanced `` lyman valley '' in its uv spectra ( iue and hst ) , which can be reproduced by their models of absorption from carbon crystalline dust ( nanodiamonds ) .",
    "ton  34 is at redshift z=1.93 and we investigated whether it could be a possible counterpart of our uv - blue qsos .",
    "it is not included in the galex surveys to date ( it is just outside the edge of an observed galex field ) , so we estimated galex fuv and nuv magnitudes by convolving the iue sw and lw spectra of ton  34 with the galex filters , and obtained fuv - nuv @xmath31.3 , close to the expected color of the uv - normal sample at this redshift and much redder than our uv - blue qsos . this color estimate is uncertain because in the iue spectra the signal is close to the background limit , and hst spectra of ton  34 do not even cover one of the galex bands .",
    "the galex fuv band includes flux longwards of 1344 , while in the iue spectrum of ton  34 the flux is very steeply rising just shortwards of this limit .",
    "therefore , a slightly more redshifted analog of ton  34 would produce a much brighter fuv magnitude .",
    "models of crystalline dust absorption by binette & krongold ( 2008 ) show that the general effect is a very deep lyman valley , and in more detail the relative amounts of absorption in the wavelength ranges sampled by the galex fuv and nuv filters at z@xmath42 vary according to the dust geometry and composition . for example , comparison of dust models in figure a.2 of binette & krongold ( 2008 ) suggests that a lower column density of the carbon crystalline dust screen ( or an intrinsic sed steeper towards short wavelengths ) may produce a higher fuv flux , and small grain dust ( similar composition as milky way dust , i.e. silicate and graphite grains , but grain sizes much smaller than mw dust and larger than nanodiamonds ) would cause a significant depression of the observed - nuv flux but less reduction of the observed - fuv at the redshift of our high - z uv - blue qsos",
    ". this effect would be qualitatively consistent with the sed of our uv - blue qsos . from broad - band photometry alone , it is not possible to separate effects of dust absorption and intrinsic sed slope , therefore we can only speculate that the observed fuv - nuv colors in our sample are qualitatively compatible with absorption from dust with grains differing from milky way dust ( smaller grains ) , and possibly a steeper flux rise towards euv .",
    "the question remains open as to what causes the extremely blue fuv - nuv colors , and whether these objects have known counterparts with similar properties , until uv spectroscopy can be obtained .",
    "we have measured the emission lines of c iv and c iii ] ( ew , total flux , and full width ( fw ) at 10% of the peak flux above the local continuum ) from the sdss spectra .",
    "typical errors are of the order of 10% .",
    "ly@xmath1 is generally too near the end of the optical spectra and could be measured only in ten cases .",
    "the c iii ] line is free of absorptions but some qsos have significant bal and interstellar absorptions in the civ line .",
    "the emission line properties do not correlate at all with the fuv - nuv color .",
    "the fuv - nuv color does correlate with the g - i color , which may indicate that extinction is involved , and with redshift , although weakly , in the sense that higher redshift objects are more uv - blue ( fig . [ f_uvcolor ] and [ f_jh2 ] ) .",
    "this is what we would expect in the rest wavelengths below the lyman limit , where the continuum is rising again .",
    "the lyman discontinuity is larger for higher redshifts too , which is likely caused by where it lies between the nuv and u bandpasses .",
    "the emission line ew is larger for fainter fuv magnitudes , but scales more slowly than the continuum flux .",
    "the line full - width is higher for more luminous qsos , based on their g - band magnitudes ( rest frame fuv ) .",
    "flux and ew of c iii ] and c iv lines correlate with the lyman discontinuity , but not the line full width .",
    "thus , there is a connection between line emission and the euv continuum .",
    "figure [ f_jh2 ] shows some of these correlations ; the spearman s @xmath25 significance test gives a probability of correlation ( clockwise from top left ) of 99% , 94% , 58% and 99% .",
    "while the dust absorption affects more the continuum , the ionization would be reflected by the line ratios .",
    "binette & krongold ( 2008 , and references therein ) discuss also the effects of shock ionization versus photoionization .",
    "it is interesting that their models show low c  iv and n  v relative to ly@xmath1 , compared with uv - normal qsos .",
    "we measured ly@xmath1@xmath26nv and c  iv in our high - redshift uv qsos where possible ( 10 cases ) .",
    "the line flux ratios may be useful diagnostic since shocks may not be related to the continuum .",
    "therefore , we also examined sdss spectra of uv - normal qsos in the same redshift range and compared their line strength with the uv - blue sample .",
    "we extracted spectroscopically confirmed qsos in the same redshift range z= 1.7 - 2.5 , but with fuv - nuv @xmath90.1 , from our master catalog of matched sources .",
    "we found 420 objects , compared with our 21 with fuv - nuv @xmath00.1 .",
    "we imposed the same error cuts in fuv , which unfavours the red ( normal ) qsos , so the ratio ( 5% ) is a lower limit for the fraction of uv - blue qsos compared with normal ones .",
    "the relative numbers however may be highly biased because the sdss spectral targets were chosen with criteria not related to our uv selection .",
    "we measured the same line ratio only for the uv - normal comparison objects with z=2.2 - 2.5 , where ly@xmath1 is included in the optical spectra .",
    "the measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_ratio ] , where a linear fit is also shown ; the formal probability of correlation is over 99% .",
    "the average line ratios for the uv - blue and uv - normal samples are given in table [ t_ratios ] .",
    "the average is 5.2 for our uv - blue sample and 3.7 for our normal comparison sample .",
    "the collisional model predicts a ratio of @xmath36.7 , and the photoionization model 1.8 . in one of our uv",
    "qsos the ratio ly@xmath1+nv  /  civ is about 10 while ton  34 has a ratio of 8.7 .",
    "this bears out the similarity with ton  34 , and a dominance of collisional ionization , compared with uv - normal qsos .",
    "we analyzed 171 spectroscopically confirmed qsos with fuv - nuv color bluer than 0.1 , extracted from the galex mis survey with complemetary sdss optical data .",
    "most of these objects have redshift @xmath00.5 , and we speculate that ly@xmath1 emission enhanced up to a factor of 3 with respect to average templates , may explain the observed colors .",
    "their optical properties are similar to those of uv - normal qsos .",
    "both photometric and emission line properties differ between point - like and extended sources , reflecting the contribution from the host galaxy in the latter",
    ". the slope of their optical spectra and the strength of h@xmath1 ( flux and ew ) correlate ( increase ) with intrinsic uv luminosity .",
    "ly@xmath1 goes through the galex fuv band in the redshift range of these objects , between 0.1 and 0.5 , therefore the resulting effect on the broad - band fuv magnitude is a combination of the line intensity and the filter s transmission curve .",
    "a restricted sub - sample with redshift around 0.2 ( where ly@xmath1 is at the peak of the filter s transmission ) seems to show tighter correlations but it is statistically insufficient to support conclusions .",
    "the uv luminosity is brighter ( @xmath30.5 to 1  mag on average ) than that of our uv - normal comparison sample , the difference being larger in fuv and for the pointlike objects ( fig .",
    "[ f_mags ] and [ f_sedlowz ] ) .",
    "our sample of uv - blue qsos also includes 21 objects with redshift between 1.7 and 2.6 .",
    "their photometric errors are generally large , the combined fuv - nuv 1  @xmath11 errors are between 0.1 and 0.37  mags , but our fuv - nuv selection limit ( fuv - nuv @xmath00.1 ) is bluer than typical qso colors at this redshift by more than half magnitude , and the observed fuv - nuv colors are bluer than the typical color by up to 1 magnitude or more ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for these uv - blue qsos at higher redshift we speculate that a combination of unusually strong absorption in galex - nuv ( restframe @xmath3600 - 900 ) and euv - steeply rising flux ( galex fuv @xmath3 restframe 450 - 590 ) may explain the fuv - nuv color .",
    "this is suggested by two facts .",
    "first , ad - hoc templates with flux rising towards restframe euv more steeply than in canonical templates , produce observed fuv - nuv colors bluer than the average template ( fig .",
    "[ f_ccd2 ] ) , but still redder than our selection limit by 0.2  mags and redder than most of our uv - blue sample by up to 1 mag .",
    "second , comparison with average sed of a uv - normal qso sample , shows the nuv luminosity of the uv - blue sample to be fainter , suggesting absorption in the observed nuv .",
    "dust with composition similar to the typical milky way dust but smaller grains and carbon crystalline nano - size grains ( nanodiamonds ) would cause absorption in the observed nuv band , according to the models of binette and krongold ( 2008 ) , which may qualitatively account for the observed fuv - nuv colors .",
    "uv spectroscopy is needed to pinpoint the cause for the fuv - nuv color of these objects .",
    "the ly@xmath1 to civ ratio is stronger in the optical spectra of the uv - blue qsos than in the uv - normal comparison sample ( at the @xmath995% confidence level from k - s test , although both samples are very small , see fig . [ f_ratio ] ) , suggesting collisional ionization to be more relevant in the uv - blue qsos .    the group of uv qsos at z@xmath32 may probe a particularly relevant phase of galaxy formation , tighly connected with the formation of the massive central black hole . in current qso / spheroid coevolution models ( e.g. granato et al 2004 )",
    "the power of the central qso rises almost exponentially and quickly stops the star formation process . during the previous phase it",
    "is strongly dust enshrouded and not visible except in x rays . a phase of decreasing ( but still significant ) extinction follows , and finally a shining phase until the fuel is consumed .",
    "a quick transition is expected between dust - extinguished and not extinguished phases for qsos at high z. the relative percentage of uv - blue qsos could be a measure of the relative lifetimes of that phase . as explained in section [ s_hiz ] , within our sample of matched galex - sdss sources ,",
    "the number of spectroscopically confirmed qsos with fuv - nuv@xmath00.1 is about 5% of those with redder fuv - nuv in the redshift range around 2 .",
    "however , this number may be highly biased because the availability of sdss spectra is serendipitous from the point of view of our selection .",
    "the fraction of sources with available spectra is not uniform across the range of optical and uv colors , and redshift , of our photometric candidate sample .",
    "spectroscopic selection especially favours the brightest samples , while bianchi et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) show for example a steep increase of uv - blue extragalactic object candidates at faint magnitudes .",
    "some uv - to - optical color ranges are also contaminated by stellar objects and the purity of photometric candidate samples varies greatly according to the colors regime and parameters .",
    "the aim of this work was to point out that a non - negligible sample of uv - blue qsos exist , and explore their nature .",
    "statistical considerations will be addressed using a larger sample .",
    "another possible bias may arise from variability , which is frequently observed in qsos .",
    "serendipitous repeated uv observations for our sample show variations by @xmath93@xmath11 in some objects , and in many cases the fuv - nuv in repeated measurements is redder than in our selected data - set , making some of these objects uv - normal or close to normal in some of the measurements , and extremely blue in others .",
    "we have tried to exclude as thoroughly as possible imaging or pipeline artifacts , using the flags provided by the pipeline and identifying several additional unreliable measurements by individual analysis .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that pipeline photometry of large datasets has statistical value , and in particular the combination of galex and sdss source catalogs over a large area of the sky proved invaluable to characterize elusive classes of objects ( bianchi et al .",
    "2007 ) , but it should not be overinterpreted for individual objects .    for both the low - redshift qsos where ly@xmath1 may be stronger ( possibly up to 3@xmath17 ) than in typical qso templates , and the high - redshift qsos where deep lyman valley absorption may occur , uv spectroscopy is needed for a conclusive explanation of the fuv - nuv color , and to assess whether these are similar to some known objects .",
    "our analysis showed that the galex photometry provides a unique sieve to select these uv - blue qsos , whose optical properties are not unusual .",
    "the analysis of this limited spectroscopic sample , and its average photometric properties , also provides useful information to separate these qsos from stellar binaries with a hot wd in our larger samples of photometric candidates ( e.g. bianchi et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) , as shown in figs [ f_ccd ] and [ f_ccd2 ] .",
    "the contamination of these objects in stellar samples may be very significant at faint magnitudes , because the density of milky way hot wds , extracted from galex catalogs , at mis depth ( uv mag @xmath3 22.7 abmag ) is much lower than that of qsos ( bianchi e al .",

    "<S> we present a sample of spectroscopically confirmed qsos with fuv - nuv color ( as measured by galex photometry , fuv band : 1344 - 1786 , nuv band : 1771 - 2831 ) bluer than canonical qso templates and than the majority of known qsos . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze their fuv to nir colors , luminosities and optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the sample includes a group of 150 objects at low redshift ( z @xmath0 0.5 ) , and a group of 21 objects with redshift 1.7@xmath0z@xmath02.6 . </S>",
    "<S> for the low redshift objects , the `` blue '' fuv - nuv color may be caused by enhanced ly@xmath1 emission , since ly@xmath1 transits the galex fuv band from z=0.1 to z=0.47 . </S>",
    "<S> synthetic qso templates constructed with ly@xmath1 up to 3 times stronger than in standard templates match the observed uv colors of our low redshift sample . </S>",
    "<S> optical photometric and spectroscopic properties of these qsos are not atypical . the h@xmath1 emission increases , and the optical spectra become bluer , with increasing absolute uv luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of selected objects at intermediate redshift is consistent with the fact that for z=0.48@xmath21.63 , ly@xmath1 is included in the galex nuv band , making the observed fuv - nuv redder than the limit of our sample selection . </S>",
    "<S> the uv - blue qsos at redshift @xmath32 , where the galex bands sample restframe @xmath4450 - 590  ( fuv ) and @xmath4590 - 940  ( nuv ) , are fainter than the average of uv - normal qsos at similar redshift in nuv , while they have comparable luminosities in other bands . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we speculate that their observed fuv - nuv color may be explained by a combination of steep flux rise towards short wavelengths and dust absorption below the lyman limit , such as from small grains or crystalline carbon ( nanodiamonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of ly@xmath1 to civ could be measured in 10 objects ; it is higher ( 30% on average ) than for uv - normal qsos , and close to the value expected for shock or collisional ionization . </S>",
    "<S> however , optical spectra are taken at different times than the uv photometry , which may bias the comparison if lines are variable . </S>",
    "<S> these qso groups are uniquely set apart by the galex photometry within larger samples , given that their optical properties are not unusual . </S>"
