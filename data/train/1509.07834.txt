    "as identification of the 1873 0.1100gev sources in the second _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) catalog @xcite progresses , blazars and spin - powered pulsars increasingly dominate the associations @xcite .",
    "for the brightest remaining unidentified sources gamma - ray spectral curvature and variability provide an excellent discrimination between these two possibilities @xcite .",
    "2fgl j2039.6@xmath15620 = 3fgl 2039.6@xmath15618 ( hereafter j2039 ) is a relatively bright @xmath3 ( 25.4@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) source with a good localization at galactic latitude -37@xmath5 , a 3fgl `` variability index '' value of 34 , and a `` curvature significance '' of 5.1@xmath4 .",
    "thus it is one of the least variable bright unidentified sources and displays significant spectral curvature , placing it well within the pulsar zone of the curvature - variability plane .",
    "accordingly it has been repeatedly searched for radio @xcite and gamma - ray @xcite pulsations .",
    "the lack of any detection is best understood if the source is a millisecond pulsar rapidly accelerated and/or wind - shrouded in a close , interacting binary @xcite .",
    "we have examined new and archival optical and x - ray data , discovering a short period ( 5.47h ) binary .",
    "the system shows evidence of heating , and the x - ray light curve is reminiscent of other shrouded ( black widow bw and redback rb ) millisecond pulsar binaries .",
    "the optical light curve is oddly double - peaked and asymmetric .",
    "nevertheless we conclude that this is another short period gamma - ray pulsar binary . with our well measured period and position , this is a fruitful target for renewed pulse searches .",
    "j2039 has a good 3fgl localization ( @xmath6 radius ) and we initially observed this field as part of our lat unidentified source campaign , using the goodman high throughput spectrograph ( ghts ) at the 4.2 m soar telescope on 2013 august 10 ( mjd 56514 , ut dates are used throughout ) .",
    "a sequence of @xmath7 180s images plus a 600s h@xmath8 frame were obtained , spaced over 2 hours and largely covering the error ellipse . despite relatively poor conditions",
    ", we were able to search for variability for counterparts as faint as @xmath9 .",
    "one star ( figure 1 ) , coincident with an x - ray source in archival data ( initially swift , later xmm exposure , see below ) was found to vary in a correlated manner in all three bands , suggesting a characteristic period @xmath10h .",
    "the usno - b1.0 position of this source is @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( 2000.0 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the catalog gives a proper motion estimate @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "no h@xmath8 structure was found in the field .",
    "7.9truecm    -0.7truecm    we searched for archival observations in this direction and found an excellent series of grond @xcite exposures of the j2039 error ellipse , with @xmath16s @xmath17(+jhk ) exposures each on 3 days aug 16 - 18 2014 ( mjd 56885 - 56887 ) .",
    "measuring these optical frames , we obtain the light curves shown in figure 2 .",
    "this data set showed a clear double - peaked light curve , with asymmetric maxima and minima and an orbital period @xmath18d ( 5.47h ) .",
    "the colors vary slightly with evidence for heating ( minimum @xmath19 ) at optical maximum .    the quest for direct detection of blind pulsations is greatly helped by a precise orbital period , which reduces the acceleration search space @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we compared with light curve phasing of our ghts observations , 371d earlier .",
    "this refined the period to 0.228116 @xmath20d where the aliases about the best minimum are set by orbit slips between the two observation sets .",
    "the target was covered in seven exposures in the des early data release , in two frames each of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and a single @xmath24 frame .",
    "we performed relative photometry against a set of the field stars from the grond images , to put the magnitudes on a consistent scale .",
    "the observation dates ranged from mjd 56538 to mjd 56558 , between our other two epochs .",
    "accordingly these points break the alias degeneracy , clearly preferring @xmath25 , the primary minimum .",
    "we thus establish @xmath26 , with barycentric epoch for optical maximum mjd 56885.085 . as discussed below",
    "it is unclear how this photometric epoch relates to the orbital kinematic epoch , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "8.3truecm    -0.7truecm    in figure 2 the ghts and des points are seen , calibrated against the grond flux scale , showing good agreement with the mean light curve .",
    "we also plot the des @xmath24 point , which lies @xmath28mag from the grond @xmath24 curve",
    ". this discrepancy may be cross - calibration error ( grond @xmath24 is split between des @xmath24 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the des data are however very spread in time : the @xmath24 point was 2.5 orbits off any other observation .",
    "the second @xmath21 point is also @xmath30 from the expected flux and was obtained 5d before the first des @xmath21 point . if , like many other bw / rb systems , the companion undergoes occasional flares , this can explain these discrepancies .",
    "however the small spread in grond photometry over 3d and the otherwise good match of the ghts and des points imply that the source is generally stable to better than @xmath31mag .",
    "j2039 is also covered in the catalina sky survey ( css ; http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/css/index.html ; drake et al . 2009 ) photometry archive with data extending 9.0y before the grond exposures .",
    "these unfiltered magnitudes with a typical error @xmath32mag are too shallow to usefully probe the light curve modulation .",
    "however , they do serve to confirm the source s general quiescence ; out of 217 observations , only one point with @xmath33mag had @xmath34 ( likely a measurement error in any event ) .",
    "the most remarkable aspect is of this light curve are the two asymmetric maxima and minima .",
    "the first minimum follows the large maximum by @xmath35 , but the second maximum and minimum arrive @xmath36 too early to lie on the opposite side of the orbit ( dotted lines in figure 2 ) .",
    "the optical color is bluest at optical maximum , but plateaus across the first minimum and second maximum , decreasing to its reddest value at the second minimum .",
    "clear there is off axis structure in the system , with heating at two ( nearly ) opposite poles or , possibly an occultation at the phase of the first minimum .",
    "8.3truecm    -0.7truecm",
    "archival swift exposures show a few counts from this counterpart , but the x - ray source is best measured in a 41.6ks live time _",
    "xmm - newton _ exposure ( obsid 0720650301 , pi : mignani ) on mjd 56575 .",
    "this data set clearly shows the optical counterpart as the brightest source in the 3fgl error ellipse . with an observation between the grond and ghts epochs ,",
    "the predicted orbital phase is known to @xmath37 dominated by the period uncertainty .",
    "folding the x - rays , we generated the pn and combined mos1/2 light curves ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the peak is coincident with the optical maximum . the double structure , while of modest statistical significance , is common to both instruments .",
    "the source is unresolved to _ xmm _ and delivered 0.024cps in 37ks effective pn camera exposure .",
    "a power law spectral fit determines a photon index @xmath38 and an upper limit on the absorption of @xmath39 ( 90% errors ) .",
    "the corresponding unabsorbed 0.5 - 10kev flux is @xmath40 .",
    "if a thermal component ( e.g. from an underlying neutron star ) is present a larger @xmath41 might be allowed .",
    "however present data do not require such a component and the absorbed power law fit is quite adequate , with @xmath42/dof=1.15 .",
    "the source bears many similarities to several other short - period shrouded pulsar binaries . at @xmath43h it may be either a redback or a black widow .",
    "however , at this period it is much closer to the shrouding line in the former case and so it is more likely a redback , given the lack of detection in repeated radio searches .",
    "although the system properties will remain quite uncertain until a pulse detection is made , we can draw some tentative conclusions from the binary data .",
    "our x - ray spectral fit indicates very little extinction , with the @xmath41 upper limit corresponding to @xmath44 for the conversion of @xcite .",
    "this is about half the total @xmath45 in this direction @xcite . at this orbital period",
    "a main sequence companion would fill its roche lobe for @xmath46 so we take this as an upper limit to the companion mass .",
    "such a star would have @xmath47k and @xmath48 , so the observed color at minimum @xmath49 indicates appreciable heating . in fact , the colors are even bluer at maximum with @xmath50 equivalent to @xmath51k .",
    "the origin of these increased temperatures is unclear ; the companion may be partly degenerate or it may experience tidal heating .",
    "however in analogy with other shrouded msp , it is likely that the effect of pulsar heating , possibly mediated by an intrabinary shock , is dominant .",
    "if we consider just the temperature rise to maximum , we derive an irradiation temperature @xmath52k and for an orbital separation @xmath53 , an isotropic irradiation luminosity @xmath54 .",
    "lower companion masses require additional heating power , although the relatively large @xmath55 implies a low inclination angle or , possibly , rapid transport of heating flux to the companion night side , as invoked for some hot jupiters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this heating flux is a lower limit to the true pulsar output . @xcite",
    "infer a typical heating efficiency @xmath56 ( some bw / rb appear to have larger heating efficiencies ) , which would imply a spin - down power @xmath57 .",
    "another power estimate can be derived from the gamma - ray flux @xmath58 : @xcite have noted a heuristic gamma - ray luminosity @xmath59 , which gives us a distance estimate @xmath60kpc .",
    "note that the spindown power estimate for an @xmath61 heating efficiency then places the source at 1.5kpc .",
    "given that @xmath41 is below the full galactic column ( at @xmath62 ) , we suspect a somewhat higher efficiency , lower power and closer distance .",
    "the usno b1.0 proper motion above corresponds to @xmath63 .",
    "msp binaries tend to be slower than the isolated young pulsar population , with @xcite giving @xmath64 .",
    "this also supports a relatively close distance .",
    "the hard power - law x - ray spectrum and strong orbital modulation indicate a non - thermal source .",
    "the light curve with an x - ray maximum flanked by two peaks and the observed @xmath65 are quite typical of bw / rb msp showing evidence for intrabinary shocks @xcite .",
    "these double peaks are generally centered around pulsar eclipse at superior conjunction as for psr j1959 + 2048 @xcite or psr j2239@xmath10533 @xcite , but have also been seen at inferior conjunction e.g. psr j2129@xmath10429 @xcite .",
    "the local minimum between these peaks may be a product of either companion eclipse or of beaming along intrabinary shock surfaces .",
    "the low x - ray luminosity also suggests a binary in the pulsar - powered state @xcite .",
    "we close by discussing the most puzzling aspect of this system , the asymmetric double peaked optical light curve .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite have recently measured the optical light curve of the redback psr j1628@xmath13205 , which has a 5h hour period and is near - roche lobe filling .",
    "this binary also shows asymmetric maxima and minima . these authors do not find a clear origin of this asymmetry , but speculate on the possibilities of swept back intrabinary shocks or magnetically - directed heating of spots on the companion surface",
    ". both are plausible for j2049 , as well",
    ". one difference , however , is that @xcite place the optical maximum @xmath66 with respect to the pulsar ascending node .",
    "thus , with this phasing the star is brightest when viewed at _",
    "quadrature_. accordingly they assign the basic double - peak modulation to ellipsoidal variations , with the intrabinary shock or magnetic heating supplying the required asymmetry . in our case without a pulsar ephemeris , we do not know the true phases and for the moment arbitrarily set @xmath67 at the optical maximum .",
    "however as noted above the characteristic double peaked x - ray light curve is often along the pulsar - companion axis . for j2049",
    "this double peak is in phase with the optical maximum . if we interpret that maximum as pulsar inferior conjunction ( view of the heated face ) , then the double x - ray peak is similar to that of psr j2129@xmath10429 .",
    "of course , none of these phase relationships are clear until we obtain a kinematic ephemeris to reference our photometric epoch , either through a pulsar discovery or through optical spectroscopy .",
    "we are pursuing both paths .",
    "this research is based in part on observations obtained at the southern astrophysical research ( soar ) telescope , which is a joint project of the ministrio da cincia , tecnologia , e inovao ( mcti ) da repblica federativa do brasil , the u.s .",
    "national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) , the university of north carolina at chapel hill ( unc ) , and michigan state university ( msu ) .",
