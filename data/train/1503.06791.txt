    "the sharp drop of the light curve is produced only by the activity of the central engine @xcite . in this _",
    ", we consider the samples in @xcite .    to explain the long - lasting activities , a highly magnetized and rapidly spinning ns model ( magnetar model ) is considered ( e.g. , * ?",
    "this comes from the fact that the spin - down timescale is @xmath7 s for a ns with the dipole magnetic field @xmath8 g and the initial rotation period @xmath9 ms .",

    ", we present a bh model that reproduces the long - lasting activities of short grbs . the point is the topological evolution of the magnetic field associated with the mass ejection and fallback processes .",
    "we show that the mass ejection , mass fallback , and magnetic field decay via reconnection are all inevitable events for the jet formation by blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite .",
    "we find that the magnetic field changes to @xmath1 g , @xmath10 g , and @xmath11 g in the prompt , extended and plateau emission , respectively .",

    "we introduce our bh model in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we compare the theoretical light curves with observations .",
    "discussions follow in section 4 .",
    "in our bh model , a bh is the central engine of short grbs including long - lasting activities such as extended emission and plateau emission .",
    "we consider the bz process for the bh to launch a relativistic jet @xcite since the neutrino - neutrino annihilation is not effective at late time ( @xmath13 s ) .",
    "our model is based on general topological consideration in figure  [ figure : model ] , without resorting to specific processes such as radiation mechanisms .",
    "there are three key ingredients for the bz process , ( i ) rotation of the bh , ( ii ) a magnetic field strength on the bh , and ( iii ) large - scale , poloidal configuration of the magnetic field , which means that the characteristic size of the poloidal field on the bh is much greater than the outer light cylinder @xcite .",
    "we consider the bh with mass @xmath14 , a spin parameter @xmath15 and a magnetic flux @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angular momentum of the bh , @xmath18 is the light speed , @xmath19 is the gravitational constant , @xmath20 is the strength of the magnetic field at the bh and @xmath21 is the radius of the bh horizon .",
    "then , the total power of the bz jet is ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , the angular frequency of the bh is @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the dimensionless spin parameter .",
    "the rotational energy of the bh formed after the binary ns merger is huge .",
    "after the inspiral phase of the binary ns merger ( phase i ) , a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) is formed ( phase ii ) , whose gravitational collapse is prevented by differential rotation and thermal pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the transport timescales of angular momentum and thermal energy ( @xmath26 s ) ,",
    "the hmns eventually collapses to a bh with its surrounding torus ( phase iii ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the numerical simulations ,",
    "the dimensionless spin parameter of the collapsed bh is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "then , the available rotational energy of the bh is @xmath28 which is enough to explain the total energy of a short grb .",
    "the problem is how to extract the rotational energy up to long timescale , @xmath29 s.    a magnetic field is amplified after the merger . in pre - merger phase , a non - recycled ns has a dipole magnetic field @xmath30 g ( phase i ) . since the radius of ns , @xmath31 km , is almost equal to that of the bh horizon with the mass @xmath32 , the strength of the magnetic field at the bh is about @xmath33 thanks to the flux conservation .",
    "the corresponding bz power is too weak to explain the typical observed luminosity of the prompt emission of short grbs , @xmath34 erg s@xmath35 .",
    "at least the strength of the magnetic field @xmath36 g is required for the bz process in equation ( [ sec2:l_bz ] ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field should be amplified by some mechanism such as kelvin - helmholtz instability and/or magnetorotational instability ( phase ii ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in matter such as the hmns and/or the torus .",
    "recent numerical simulations support such a picture ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the magnetic field should be expanded to large scale for the bz process to work . at the same time , this expansion should be associated with the mass ejection because of the frozen - in condition ( phase iii ) .",
    "the mass ejection is caused by such as winds driven by dynamical interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neutrinos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and viscous heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although these scenarios do not currently succeed in numerical simulations , the amplification and the expansion of the magnetic field are necessary to explain the observed short grbs regardless of details .    the central bh accretes mass from the surrounding torus .",
    "the timescale of the accretion is determined by the viscosity timescale at the inner radius of the torus @xmath37 s ( phase iv ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has been widely discussed that the torus accretion could explain the prompt emission of short grbs .",
    "in addition , the ejected matter falls back to the bh .",
    "this is because the ejecta become homologous due to the interaction within ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the interior part of the ejecta does not exceed the escape velocity ( phase v ) .",
    "the fallback mass is comparable to or larger than that of the escaping ejecta because the inner part of ejecta is more massive @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the mass accretion rate is described by the following power - law function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total fallback mass .",
    "the fallback enables the long - lasting activities of the bz jet because the pressure of the fallback matter supports the magnetic flux on the bh , ( phases v and vii ) .",
    "as long as the magnetic flux @xmath40 is constant , the bz power does not directly depend on the mass accretion rate ( in equation  [ sec2:l_bz ] ) and the light curve becomes plateau - like @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the important point is that the fallback matter drags the magnetic field line to the bh because of the frozen - in condition and eventually forces the anti - directed magnetic fields to reconnect ( phases iv and vi ) .",
    "then , the magnetic flux on the bh @xmath40 as well as the bz power @xmath42 decrease . in other words ,",
    "_ the long - lasting activities require the fallback matter , which itself inevitably leads to the magnetic flux decay .",
    "_ this topological argument does not depend on the specific physical processes .",
    "different values of the magnetic fields explain the bz power at different phases , prompt ( phase iii ) , extended ( phase v ) and plateau emission ( phase vii ) as quantitatively shown in the next section .",
    "the minimum magnetic flux after the reconnection ( phase vii ) is determined by the initial flux of a ns before the merger ( phase i ) .",
    "the bh activity ends if the pressure of the fallback matter becomes too small to support the magnetic flux .",
    "then , the magnetic field lines escape from the bh ( phase viii ) .",
    ". for the rebrightening component at @xmath9 s , we consider flaring activities discussed in section 4.,width=226 ]    figure  [ figure : test ] shows the theoretical light curve with a thick curve .",
    "black lines denote the constant luminosity phases ( iii , v and vii ) , and light - green lines denote the decay phases ( iv , vi and viii ) .",
    "constant luminosities at three phases ( iii , v and vii ) suggest constant magnetic fields in equation  ( [ sec2:l_bz ] ) ; @xmath43 g at the prompt emission ( phase iii ) , @xmath10 g at the extended emission ( phase v ) and @xmath11 g at the plateau emission ( phase vii ) , respectively . here , we assume @xmath27 @xcite , so that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the schwarzschild radius . to convert the luminosity from the bz power @xmath42 to the observed isotropic luminosity @xmath46",
    ", we take into account the beaming correction ( @xmath47 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the radiative efficiency ( @xmath48 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath49 using equations ( [ sec2:l_bz ] ) and ( [ sec3:l ] ) , the strength of the magnetic field is determined by the observed luminosity @xmath46 as @xmath50    a characteristic timescale of the bz jet activity is determined by the pressure balance near the bh .",
    "as the mass accretion rate decreases , the pressure of the fallback matter @xmath51 falls short of the magnetic pressure @xmath52 ( making a magnetically - arrested disk ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then , the magnetic flux expands the torus and decreases on the bh , leading to the reduction of the bz power .",
    "the pressure of the magnetic field is @xmath53 under the magnetic flux conservation , where @xmath54 is the radial distance .",
    "the pressure of the fallback matter is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the radial velocity . for the radial velocity @xmath57 ,",
    "we assume @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the free - fall velocity . for the value of @xmath60",
    ", we adopt @xmath61 which is supported by the observations and numerical simulations of the relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then , the magnetospheric radius @xmath62 , where the equilibrium point between two pressures @xmath51 ( equation [ sec3:p_b ] ) and @xmath52 ( equation [ sec3:p_f ] ) , is @xmath63 using equation  ( [ sec3:r_m ] ) and the temporal evolution of the mass accretion rate ( equation  [ sec2:dotm ] ) , we obtain the characteristic timescale of the bz jet @xmath64 using equations  ( [ sec3:b_h ] ) and ( [ sec3:t ] ) , the total fallback mass is determined by the observed luminosity @xmath46 and duration @xmath65 as @xmath66        after the time @xmath67 , the bz power evolves as @xmath68 derived by the magnetic flux @xmath69 and the time dependence @xmath70 from equations  ( [ sec2:dotm ] ) and ( [ sec3:r_m ] ) .",
    "thus , we model the bz power as @xmath71    the maximum value of the bz power @xmath42 is determined by the accretion power @xmath72 . in fact , using the condition @xmath73 and equations ( [ sec2:l_bz ] ) , ( [ sec3:p_b ] ) and ( [ sec3:p_f ] ) , the ratio is @xmath74 . for comparison ,",
