    "the emission in each of the three transitions cover a velocity range between 74 to 4 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the morphology of the emission is broadly consistent with the lines forming in an expanding environment because the emission is most compact at the extreme blueshifted and redshifted velocity channels and becomes progressively more extended in velocity channels around the systemic velocity of v@xmath8=35 kms@xmath5 inferred by truong - bach et al .",
    "( 1988 ) from the observations of a number of molecular lines in the egg nebula .",
    "we integrate all the emission above 2@xmath9 level in the channel maps of the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines .",
    "the resulting total intensity profiles are presented in figure 4 .",
    "clearly the strength and the shape of all three nh@xmath0 lines are almost identical .",
    "the line shape is not the usual parabola , which is typical for an optically thick line formed in an expanding spherical circumstellar envelope . instead",
    ", the line profiles have a triangular shape , reflecting the more peculiar kinematics and spatial distribution of ammonia in the egg nebula .",
    "these three lines of ammonia were observed previously using the single dish telescope by nguyen - q - rieu et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and truong - bach et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . using a conversion factor of @xmath20.73 jy k@xmath5 appropriate for the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope at the frequencies of the nh@xmath0 lines",
    ", we estimate that the peak flux in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines is @xmath260 mjy , similar to that seen in our vla observations ( see figure 4 ) . the strength of the ( 2,2 ) line as observed by nguyen - q - rieu et al .",
    "( 1984 ) is slightly weaker than the other two lines . in our vla observations",
    "we find that the strength of the ( 2,2 ) line is the almost the same as that for the ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines .",
    "it is likely that the relative weakness of the ( 2,2 ) in the single dish observation might be due to either calibration and/or the low s / n of the single dish data .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our vla observations have recovered all the flux in all three inversion lines of ammonia .",
    "it s well known that each of the inversion lines of ammonia has complex hyperfine structure . however , the hyperfine splitting is only significant for the ( 1,1 ) line ( kukolich 1967 ) .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the ( 1,1 ) line consists of the main line group and four groups of satellite lines , which are shifted in velocity in either direction by @xmath28 and @xmath220 kms@xmath5 . assuming the the hyperfine lines are optically thin and form under lte condition , the intensity of the satellite groups at @xmath1020 kms@xmath5 is about 20% of that for the main line ( kukolich 1967 , rydbeck et al .",
    "1977 ) . because the peak flux of the ( 1,1 ) line is about @xmath210@xmath9 in the velocity channels",
    "43.6 kms@xmath5 and 48.6 kms@xmath5 , where the rms noise level @xmath9 = 2 mjy beam@xmath5 , the contribution to the intensity of the line in other velocity channels such as 23.9 kms@xmath5 and 28.8 kms@xmath5 due to the hyperfine splitting is approximately is @xmath22@xmath9 .",
    "this contribution due to hyperfine structure is modest in comparison to the observed ( 1,1 ) lines intensity in the abovementioned velocity channels . as a result",
    ", we conclude that hyperfine structure in the ( 1,1 ) line does not affect significantly the discussion on the spatial distrubtion of the emission and also the velocity structure of the nh@xmath0 in the egg nebula .",
    "close inspection of the channel maps reveals that the spatial distribution and kinematics of the emission in three transitions of nh@xmath0 are very similar .",
    "we can clearly separate the ammonia emission into four components having distinct spatial - kinematics , which will be referred as the north , south , east and west lobes .",
    "the north and south lobes are most easily seen in the blueshifted and redshifted velocity channels between 53 to 68 kms@xmath5 and 4 to 24 kms@xmath5 , respectively . these components",
    "extend to the north and south of the center of the nebula along the bipolar axis as defined in the optical images . in the channel maps of all three lines ,",
    "only the north lobe can be seen as distinct .",
    "the south lobe is a protrusion connected to the stronger east lobe .",
    "the east and west lobes can be seen prominently in the velocity channels between 29 to 48 kms@xmath5 straddling the systemic velocity .",
    "these components are stronger in intensity and aligned in the equatorial direction of the nebula . in all three lines the intensity of the emission from the east lobe is dominant over other components .",
    "we note that the east and west lobes are located on either side of the center of the nebula where there is a general lack of emission .",
    "that can be seen notably in the central velocity channel at 34 kms@xmath5 of nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines shown in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "we integrate all the emission stronger than 2@xmath9 in the channel maps to produce the integrated intensity maps of all three nh@xmath0 lines .",
    "the maps are shown in figures 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "the nh@xmath0 emission in all three lines shows a cross - like shape , especially in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) .",
    "the cross - like shape is the natural result of the presence of four components identified in the channel maps .",
    "the total spatial extent of the emission is about @xmath214 in both the polar direction and the equatorial direction .",
    "we note that the north and south lobes appear distinct and more prominent in ortho - nh@xmath0(3,3 ) transition than in lower lying para - nh@xmath0 transitions ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) . comparing to previous observation of nguyen - q - rieu et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , we can see that the dramatic improvement in sensitivity of the vla allows us to detect the fainter emission in the north and south lobes and provides the full picture of the nh@xmath0 distribution in the egg nebula .    to investigate the kinematics of the nh@xmath0 emission we form the intensity - weighted mean velocity maps of all three lines using all the emission stronger than 4@xmath9 level in the channel maps .",
    "the resulting maps are also shown in figures 5 , 6 and 7 . in all three lines",
    "the the north and south lobes exhibit opposite mean velocity , i.e. the emission in the north lobe is entirely blue - shifted and that in the south lobe is entirely red - shifted .",
    "these two lobes in the polar direction are almost mirror symmetric in spatial morphology and mean velocity with respect to the center of the nebula . in the equatorial direction , the kinematics of the east and west lobes is more complicated .",
    "that is most clearly seen in the mean velocity maps of nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines .",
    "most of the emission in the east lobe is blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "the northern portion of the east lobe is , however , moving at slower velocities almost the same as the systemic velocity .",
    "the kinematics of the west lobe is almost mirror symmetric with respect to the of the east lobe ,",
    "i.e most of the emission is redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity with the southern portion moving at an average velocity close to the systemic velocity .",
    "most likely the east and west lobes consist of multiple kinematic sub - components with very different spatial kinematics .",
    "this point will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "the inversion transitions of nh@xmath0 have been widely used to gauge the physical conditions in different environments , especially in starforming regions .",
    "therefore our obserations of multilines in the egg nebula can be used to infer the physical conditions of the molecular gas through the excitation analysis .",
    "more specifically , the gas temperature can be estimated from the line ratios together with some plausible assumptions .",
    "we form the line ratio maps ( 2,2)/(1,1 ) and ( 3,3)/(1,1 ) by convolving the channel maps to the same angular resolution of 4.1 and then producing the integrated intensity maps and then the line ratio maps .",
    "the line ratio maps are shown in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "surprisingly , the spatial distribution of the two line ratios is very similar . although the east and west lobe are stronger in the integrated intensity maps , the line ratios there are generally low , ranging from about 0.3 to 0.9 for both nh@xmath0(2,2)/(1,1 ) and nh@xmath0(3,3)/(1,1 ) . in constrast ,",
    "the line ratios are generally higher in the polar direction , ranging from 0.8 up to 1.4 for both cases . because the excitation of higher lying transitions nh@xmath0(2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) requires hot and dense gas , high line ratios in the polar direction suggests that the molecular gas in the polar lobes is both hotter and denser in comparison to the molecular gas present in the equatorial plane .",
    "if we assume that the nh@xmath0 inversion lines are optically thin , the opacity ratio for any pair of lines can be calculated as follows ( ho & townes 1983 ) : @xmath11 where t@xmath12(j , k ) is the excitation temperature of the inversion line , @xmath13 = @xmath14/[j(j+1 ) ] are the dipole matrix elements , @xmath15 is the statistical weight , @xmath15 = @xmath16 , with @xmath17 = 1 for para - ammonia levels ( j = 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , ... ) and @xmath17 = 2 for ortho - ammonia levels ( j = 0 , 3 , 6 , ... ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the energy difference between two states ( j,k ) and ( j , k ) . in the optically thin limit",
    ", we can use the line ratio to estimate the rotation temperature t@xmath19 between states ( j , k ) and ( j,k ) , which is a good indicator of the gas temperature t@xmath20 .",
    "the rotation temperature can be calculated from the following expression ( menten & alcolea 1995 ) : @xmath21 \\left\\{{\\rm ln}\\left [ \\frac{\\int t_b(j , k)dv}{\\int t_{b}(j',k')dv }   \\frac{j(j+1)k'^2(2j+1)}{j'(j'+1)k^2(2j+1 ) } \\frac{g'_{op}}{g_{op}}\\right]\\right\\}^{-1}\\ ] ] the energy difference between ( 2,2 ) and ( 1,1 ) states is 41.2 k and that for ( 3,3 ) and ( 1,1 ) states is 100.3 k , respectively ( menten & alcolea 1995 ) . from the values of the ( 2,2)/(1,1 ) ratio mentioned above we estimate that the rotation temperature t@xmath22(2,2;1,1 ) ranges between @xmath221 to 46 k in the east and west lobes . in the polar direction the rotation temperature t@xmath22(2,2;1,1 ) can reach as high as 90 k because of the higher line ratio .",
    "similarly , we find that the rotation temperature t@xmath22(3,3;1,1 ) is in the range between 32 to 50 k in the east and west lobes and reaches higher value up to 62 k in the polar direction .",
    "we note that the high rotation temperatures derived here are broadly consistent with our optically thin assumption for the inversion lines of nh@xmath0 . as we can see from the channel maps of ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines , the brightness temperature is in the range 1 to 4 k , eventhough the emitting regions are spatially resolved .",
    "thus the inversion lines are likely optically thin if the excitation temperatures t@xmath12(j , k ) is comparable to the derived rotation temperatures .",
    "we caution , however , that the rotation temperature between ortho - ammonia state ( 3,3 ) and the para - ammonia state ( 1,1 ) is of limited meaning because of the selection rule that forbids any radiative or collisional transition connecting between the ortho and para states ( ho & townes 1983 ) .      the complex morphology and spatial kinematics of ammonia emission indicate that ammonia emission does not originate from the unshocked remnant agb wind . instead",
    ", there are several lines of evidences suggesting that the emission is associated with the shocked molecular gas produced by the interaction between high velocity jets and the slowing expanding shell ejected when the central star was still on the agb phase .    from high angular resolution observations of co j=21 line , cox et al .",
    "( 2000 ) identify a series of high velocity molecular outflows in the egg nebula .",
    "these outflows are oriented in the polar axis and in the equatorial direction .",
    "more interestingly , these outflows can be traced back to a common origin close to the center of the nebula . in figures 4 , 5 and 6",
    "we overlay the location of the molecular outflows identified by cox et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the integrated intensity maps of nh@xmath0 emission .",
    "these outflows form a cross - like shape , very similar to the morphology of the nh@xmath0 emission , and spatially coincide with the location of the four lobes traced by the nh@xmath0 emission .",
    "we also find that the nh@xmath0 emission covers a similar velocity range ( between 74 to 4 kms@xmath5 ) as the co j=21 line and exhibits similar spatial kinematics .",
    "namely , the co emission in the polar direction appears blueshifted in the north and redshifted in the south , as expected from the mean velocity maps of nh@xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the co j=21 emission associated with outflows in the equatorial direction exhibits blueshifted emission in the east and redshifted in the west , exactly the same trend seen in the intensity weighted mean velocity maps of nh@xmath0 emission shown in figures 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "the kinematics of strong molecular hydrogen emission at 2.2 @xmath4 m , which is commonly believed to trace the shocked gas , has been shown by kastner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to be similar to that seen in co j=21 emission .",
    "in addition , in the equatorial direction , the prominent and extended molecular hydroge emission in the east , which exhibits blueshifted velocities , can be separated into three distinct sub - components with different spatial kinematics . among the three sub - component e2 , e3 and e4 in the terminology of sahai et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , the e4 sub - component located to the north is moving more slowly than other sub - components .",
    "comparison with the mean velocity maps of nh@xmath0 emission we also see that the northern portion of the east lobe has lower average velocity , almost the same as the systemic velocity .",
    "kastner et al . (",
    "2001 ) propose that the spatial kinematics of the molecular hydrogen emission could result from rotation in the equatorial plane of the egg nebula .",
    "a similar suggestion was made early by bieging & nguyen - q - rieu ( 1996 ) based on their observations of the hcn j=10 line .",
    "however , our current observations , which have similar spatial and velocity resolution , do not add any new information to either support or disprove the suggestion of rotation in the equatorial plane in the egg nebula .",
    "the similarity in spatial distribution and kinematics observed in molecular hydrogen emission and nh@xmath0 inversion transitions strongly suggest that the nh@xmath0 emission originates from the shocked molecular gas .",
    "we note , however , that the molecular hydrogen emission arises from molecular gas at temperature at least as high as 1000  2000 k , whereas the nh@xmath0 emission is coming from much lower temperature gas as suggested by the low rotation temperatures of the inversion lines estimated in the previous section .",
    "this would imply a large temperature gradient within the shocked region and the emission lines from either molecular hydrogen or nh@xmath0 would trace the temperature range most favorable to the their excitation .",
    "the strong ammonia emission associated with the shocked molecular gas and the lack of emission at the center of the egg nebula suggest that most of the ammonia did not formed initially in the agb wind but is produced in the shocked gas .",
    "generally , nh@xmath0 is not thought to form through gas - phase chemistry in the dusty wind of agb stars . in chemical models for circumstellar envelopes ,",
    "nh@xmath0 is either not considered ( glassgold et al . 1986 , cherchneff et al . 1993 ) or assumed to formed initially in the stellar atmosphere and injected into the wind ( millar & herbst 1994 ) .",
    "willacy & cherchneff ( 1998 ) considered the effect of shock processing on the molecular abundances for the case of the prototypical carbon rich agb star irc+10216 .",
    "however , the number abundance of nh@xmath0 ( relative to h@xmath23 ) even in that case remains very low , up to only about a few 10@xmath24 .",
    "nejad et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and flower et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that the nh@xmath0 molecules might form through surface chemistry on dust grains and remain on the grain surface until the release by the passage of shocks . in their model ,",
    "a shock velocity in the range 10 to 15 km s@xmath5 would heat up the gas and lead to the release of nh@xmath0 from the dust grain mantles .",
    "the theoretical calculations of burton et al .",
    "( 1992 ) indicate that a minimum shock velocity of about 10 kms@xmath5 is neccessary to excite the molecular hydrogen 2.2 @xmath4 m line .",
    "the observations of strong molecular hydrogren 2.2 @xmath4 m emission in the egg nebula ( sahai et al .",
    "1998b ) suggest that the strength of the shocks in the egg nebula is comparable or even stronger than needed in the abovementioned chemical models in order to produce the abundance enhancement of nh@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the relatively high rotation temperatures estimated from the ratio of ammonia inversion lines also favors this scenario in the egg nebula .",
    "we note that similar observations of the enhanced ammonia emission in the bipolar outflows from young stellar objects . for l1155 outflow ,",
    "tafalla & bachiller ( 1995 ) found very good spatial coincidence between ammonia emission and the distribution of sio j=21 line , which is considered as a good tracer of the shocked gas .",
    "follow up observations by umemoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) revealed the emission from highly excited ( 5,5 ) and ( 6,6 ) inversion lines .",
    "the high rotational temperature of ammonia molecules as well as the significant departure of the ortho  para ratio from the statistical equilibrium value point to the evaporation of nh@xmath0 from the surface of dust grains following the passage of shocks .",
    "given the relatively well constrained geometry and physical conditions inside the egg nebula , more elaborate models should be attempted to explore further the formation and excitation of ammonia in the shock regions .",
    "in this paper we have imaged at high angular resolution the emission of nh@xmath0(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) inversion lines from the egg nebula .",
    "we find that the spatial distribution and kinematics of the emission in all three lines show four distinct components or lobes that are aligned with the polar and equatorial directions .",
    "the kinematics of the nh@xmath0 emission is also found to follow a clear pattern : redshifted emission in the south and west and blueshifted emission in the north and east .",
    "the morphology and spatial kinematics of nh@xmath0 emission are shown to have strong similarity to that observed previously in molecular hydrogen emission and co emission which arise from the shocked molecular gas .",
    "we also find that the higher lying inversion transition nh@xmath0 ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) are stronger in the polar direction in comparison to the lower transition nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) .",
    "we conclude that the nh@xmath0 emission traces the warm molecular gas , which is shocked and heated by the interaction between the high velocity outflows and the surrounding envelope . from the association of nh@xmath0 emission with the shocked molecular gas and the lack of the emission at the center of the nebula",
    "we conclude that the abundance of ammonia is significantly enhanced by shocks , a situation very similar to that found in outflows from protostars .",

    "<S> we present high angular resolution observations of the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) inversion transitions from the egg nebula , the archetypical proto - planetary nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution and kinematics of the emission in all three lines show four distinct components or lobes that are aligned with the polar and equatorial directions . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the nh@xmath0 emission is also found to follow a clear pattern : redshifted emission in the south and west and blueshifted emission in the north and east . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology and spatial kinematics of nh@xmath0 emission are shown to have strong similarity to that observed previously in molecular hydrogen emission and co emission which arise from the shocked molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the higher lying inversion transition nh@xmath0 ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) are stronger in the polar direction in comparison to the lower transition nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the nh@xmath0 emission traces the warm molecular gas , which is shocked and heated by the interaction between the high velocity outflows and the surrounding envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of strong ammonia emission associated with the shock fronts and the lack of the emission at the center of the nebula indicate that the abundance of ammonia is significantly enhanced by shocks , a situation very similar to that found in outflows from protostars . </S>"
