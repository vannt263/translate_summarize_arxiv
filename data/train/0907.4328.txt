    "it is known that using a proper weight function , @xmath77 , one can construct a levy distribution from a parameterized set of gaussian distributions of different dispersion , @xmath78 @xcite . yet , to the best of our knowledge , there are no results concerning the superposition of many different levy distribution functions with _ different exponents _ @xmath10 .    a next objective is the comparison of our scheme with the experimental data from ref .",
    "@xcite , see fig .  4 . as one can deduce the levy distribution yields an excellent approximation for the md of the experimental system although the latter does not map precisely to a tg gas , but rather corresponds to a set of @xmath0 soft - core bosons with @xmath79 ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) @xcite . in the experiment ,",

    "we have shown that the tunable levy distribution fits momentum profiles up to one recoil momentum with high accuracy .",
    "this allows for calibration of tg states with a unique scaling exponent .",

    "we demonstrate that the md of a tg gas confined in a 1d box , in a sole 1d harmonic potential and on a 1d optical lattice with hard wall boundaries can be approximated by the levy distribution function ( [ eq : levy ] ) on a finite momentum region @xmath104 , where for a tg gas the universal power - law , @xmath100 , at large momenta has not yet developed .",
    "we thus conjecture that levy scaling of md is generic feature of a thermalized tg gas .",
    "we want to emphasize one aspect which we consider to be crucial for the understanding of our approach .",
    "it is known that the levy distribution has appeared as the stable distribution , i.e. the `` attractor '' for normalized sums of independent and identically - distributed random variables , with no finite mean values .",
    "the latter has opened the door to anomalous _",

    ", we employ the levy distribution ( [ eq : levy ] ) merely as a _ mathematical function _ , which is a natural generalization of the standard gaussian function , thus leaving aside all the possible statistical interpretations and speculations concerning physical processes responsible for the md formation . a good example for",
    "such `` applied '' approaches is the widespread use of the gaussian distribution , which describes the wave function of the ground state of the quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite , the green s function solution of the deterministic heat or diffusion equation @xcite , and frequently results as a form function in many different physical contexts .",
    "while it is intuitively clear that it is the long - range correlations in the system that cause the emergence of levy distributions , the task to unravel the inherent physical mechanism(s ) yielding this anomalous distribution remains a challenge .",
    "we think that the analysis of a reduced single - particle density matrix in a spirit of the theory of random levy matrices @xcite may shed additional light on this intriguing issue .",
    "within the grand - canonical description , the number of bosons , @xmath0 , is a fluctuating quantity and the reduced single - particle density matrix is defined as the trace over the fock space , @xmath116 where the chemical potential @xmath117 is fixed to give the required number of particles @xmath118 in the system , @xmath119 with @xmath120 being the boltzmann factor , and @xmath121 is the grand - canonical partition function .",

    "all operators entering above are the square matrices @xmath127 defined as follows : @xmath128 denotes the identity matrix , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 is the orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors satisfying the eigenproblem , @xmath132 , with single - particle version of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) @xmath133 and @xmath134 is diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues , i.e. , @xmath135 .",
    "thus , to obtain the entire matrix @xmath25 ( @xmath136 ) one has to compute @xmath137 determinants of @xmath127 matrices .",
    "in the canonical formalism , the particle reservoir is absent , meaning that one has to find the number , @xmath138 , self - consistently from those many particle states , @xmath139 , together with their eigenenergies , @xmath140 , that contribute to the thermal superposition at a given temperature .",
    "the reduced single - particle density matrix is then obtained as a sum of thermally weighted density matrices , @xmath141 , evaluated for each from @xmath138 eigenstates separately ; i.e. , @xmath142 the canonical partition function @xmath143 is expressed through the true many particle energy spectrum : @xmath144 .",
