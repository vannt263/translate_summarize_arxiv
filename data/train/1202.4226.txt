    "the probability distribution @xmath7 of production of @xmath8 particles from collisions , has been the premier of basic observables , characterizing the final states of multi - particle production process in high energy physics experiments since the beginning of such studies . in recent times , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite at cern has taken high energy collisions in laboratories to a new energy domain , facilitating proton - proton ( @xmath9 ) collisions at centre - of - mass energies , @xmath10 = 0.9 , 2.36 and 7 tev @xcite .",
    "the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment at lhc has measured multiplicity distributions of primary charged hadrons for all the three lhc energies , available so far , in the mid - pseudorapidity ( @xmath11 ) region ( where @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 is the polar angle of the particle with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction ) in five symmetric overlapping @xmath11-intervals @xmath5 or @xmath14 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 and 2.4 @xcite around the centre - of - mass pseudorapidity ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the measured mean multiplicities at the new lhc energies ( @xmath02.36 and 7 tev ) in the range of mid - pseudorapidity , have been found to be largely underestimated by existing models ( event generators like pythia , phojet etc ) .",
    "other experiments at lhc corroborate the finding , generating strong motivation to look into the lhc data from different approaches .",
    "another significant observation by the cms experiment is the change in slope in the distribution of primary charged hadrons in pseudorapidity interval @xmath16 at @xmath3 tev .",
    "appearance of a change in slope in the measured distribution indicates to the possible existence of more - than - one process or source of particle production . in this article",
    ", we present results of our analysis of multiplicity distributions data from @xmath9 collisions at lhc , in the light of a two - component model @xcite formulated in a quantum statistical approach .",
    "we extend our study further to check the validity of a scaling law involving information entropy in quantum statistical point of view .",
    "in the last few decades , with the advent of accelerator technology , collider facilities , capable of delivering higher and higher centre - of - mass energy ( @xmath17 ) , could be made available for proton - proton ( @xmath9 ) and proton- antiproton ( @xmath18 ) collisions . while the intersecting storage ring ( isr ) , cern facilitated pp collisions at @xmath17 range of 23.9 to 62.2 gev @xcite , the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) , cern had @xmath18 collisions at @xmath19 to @xmath20 gev @xcite . in the tevatron at fermi lab ,",
    "the energies of @xmath18 collisions were @xmath21 gev to @xmath22 tev @xcite and finally at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , cern , energy of collisions of protons have reached @xmath17 as high as 7 tev @xcite . with all these data along with data at the fixed - target ( non - collider ) experiments at pre - isr period ,",
    "a rich set of experimental data on multiplicity distributions from @xmath9 ( @xmath18 ) collisions is now available for a wide range of @xmath10 for a comprehensive and systematic study in different theoretical and phenomenological formalisms for better understanding of multiparticle production mechanism .",
    "the two - component model @xcite of particle productions is one such formalism which has been thoroughly used in analyzing experimental data of @xmath9 ( @xmath18 ) collisions at energies available up to the sps .    of the statistical distribution functions , the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) , @xmath23^n \\times",
    "\\left[\\frac{k}{k+\\langle n \\rangle}\\right]^k\\ ] ] has been the most successful one in describing the probability distributions of final state charged particles from @xmath9 ( @xmath18 ) collisions in the discussed energy domain . at the lower part of the energy range , the multiplicity distributions of final state charged particles in the full phase space could be described by binomial distribution ( when the parameter @xmath24 in equation-1 is negative and an integer ) . at around @xmath10 = 5 gev , the distribution of produced charged particles turned broader and started following poisson distribution ( @xmath24 is infinite ) . above @xmath10",
    "= 30 gev , the nbd matched fairly well with even broader distributions in the full phase space ( pseudorapidity space ) data up to @xmath0 540 gev at sps . at @xmath20 gev at sps , when a shoulder - like structure appeared in the tail of the multiplicity distributions , a single nbd failed in matching with the data at large pseudorapidity intervals . at 900 gev and also at 1.8 tev at tevatron , the nbd function was successful only in the restricted mid - pseudorapidity ( @xmath25 ) region .",
    "the distribution in large @xmath11-interval could be reasonably described with the sum of two nbds .",
    "at the lhc energies , multiplicity distributions in non - single diffractive ( nsd ) inelastic proton - proton collisions have been measured and reported by different experiments , in different kinematic ranges , depending on capability of respective detector setup in terms of geometrical acceptance , detection efficiencies etc . a large ion collider experiment ( alice ) at lhc has measured primary charged particles at @xmath10 = 0.9 and 2.36 tev in the mid-@xmath11 region in three overlapping @xmath11-intervals @xmath2 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.3 @xcite . at @xmath10 = 7 tev , instead of nsd inelastic events , alice analyzed @xcite an event class requiring at least one charged particle in @xmath26 and measured multiplicity distribution in that @xmath11-interval only .",
    "the atlas experiment at lhc has measured charged particle multiplicities for different event classes characterized by different lower cuts on the number of charged particles ( @xmath27 , 2 and 6 ) in different kinematic ranges ( @xmath28 100 mev , 500 mev in @xmath22.5 ) .",
    "the distributions measured by alice in the three @xmath29-intervals , @xmath2 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.3 , at the two energies , @xmath30 tev , @xmath31 tev have been reported to match fairly well with nbd .",
    "the nbd fit to the distribution at @xmath10 = 7 tev , measured by alice , has been reported to be slightly underestimating the data at low multiplicity ( @xmath32 ) and slightly overestimating the data at high multiplicity ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "measurements of multiplicity distributions in a wider phase space and in all the three energies by cms experiment , reveal interesting features . presenting @xcite multiplicity distributions , without fitting to any distribution function , cms reported a change of slope in @xmath34 for @xmath35 in its largest @xmath11-interval of @xmath16 .",
    "this feature becomes more pronounced with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "the observed change in slope in the distributions as measured by cms could be attributed to the existence of more than one kind of source or process of particle production .",
    "there have been several proposals of models @xcite involving multi - particle production from more than one process / source . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is the weighted superposition of two multiplicity distributions ( each assumed to follow nbd ) ; one due to soft events ( without mini - jets ) and the other representing semi - hard events ( with mini - jets ) . in the multiparton interactions model described in refs.@xcite , the soft component , which constitute the bulk of events in the final state , corresponds to single parton - parton collisions in the framework of dual parton model and produces kno @xcite distribution .",
    "the other process , which seems to be superimposed on top of the kno producing process , involves two or more independent parton - parton collisions .",
    "ref.@xcite is a two - component dual parton model ( dpm ) , the soft process is described by the supercritical pomeron and the hard component is described by perturbative qcd .",
    "this two - component dpm includes diffractive processes also . in spite of all these efforts ,",
    "the change in slope in distributions is not yet a fully understood phenomenon .",
    "we recollect that the distribution at @xmath0 900 gev in broad phase space has been explained by sum of two nbds .",
    "also , there has been agreement @xcite on the soft parts ( as measured in ua5 and e735 experiments ) obtained by the models described in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "but , at this point , it is important to consider relative position of the change in slope in the distributions of data at @xmath36 900 gev at sps and @xmath36 7 tev at lhc .",
    "the change in slope appeared in sps data at a higher multiplicity ( @xmath8 ) and a sum of two nbds ( representing two broad distributions ) could describe the data satisfactorily . for the lhc data ,",
    "the most prominent change in slope appears in the multiplicity distribution in the symmetric pseudorapidity interval , @xmath14 2.4 at @xmath07 tev at much lower multiplicity ( @xmath37 ) , indicating that the measured distribution could be due to contributions from a broad distribution and a narrow distribution .",
    "such a scenario is provided by a two - component model @xcite in quantum statistical approach , where a weighted average of a nbd ( representing a broad distribution ) with @xmath38 due to a chaotic source and a poisson distribution ( representing a narrow distribution ) due to a coherent source results into the final distribution .",
    "we follow this two - component model in qs viewpoint to analyze the lhc data .",
    "in the two - component model @xcite in qs approach , the total mean multiplicity is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coherent component and @xmath41 is the chaotic component of the mean of total multiplicity .    in quantum statistics , a completely chaotic source produces particles following a negative binomial distribution given by equation-1 ( @xmath8 in equation-1 is to be read as @xmath42 in the present formalism ) , where k is the number of cells in the phase space or the number of independent quantum states . on the other hand ,",
    "a completely coherent source gives rise to a poisson distribution :    @xmath43    the mean of the chaotic component of total multiplicity , @xmath44 is obtained from the measured mean of total multiplicity and the second moment of the distribution by : @xmath45 where @xmath46^{1/2}\\ ] ] is the chaoticity parameter , @xmath47 is the second moment of multiplicity distribution and @xmath48 can have value either 1 or 2 .",
