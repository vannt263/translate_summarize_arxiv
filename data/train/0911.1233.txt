    "the control of these patterns is a central issue in materials science @xcite and raises fundamental problems in nonlinear physics .",

    "the morphology of the fingers above the critical point evolves from rounded cells at @xmath5 to dendrites ( parabolic tip and sidebranches ) at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the dominant factors in the process are the diffusion of the chemical species in the liquid , and the resistance of the solid - liquid interface to deformation , which is determined by @xmath2 and the physical properties of the interface itself , namely , its surface tension @xmath7 and kinetic coefficient @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the kinetic undercooling . while the value of @xmath10 is approximately independent of @xmath7 and @xmath11",

    "the distinction between two - dimensional ( or thin ) and three - dimensional ( or bulk ) solidification is also important .",
    "this article reports the results of an experimental investigation of pattern formation during thin directional solidification ( t - ds ) in a substance forming faceted ( monoclinic ) crystals , namely , impure biphenyl .",
    "the geometry of the experiments is specified in figure [ setupf ] .",
    "we focus on the growth patterns , called weakly faceted ( wf ) patterns , that bring into play only high - mobility facets . under usual experimental conditions ( _ i.e. _ far from any roughening transition ) ,",
    "facet mobility is controlled by the motion of one - molecule - thick growth sk.jpg emitted from certain sites ( intersections with crystal dislocations , contacts with other crystals ) @xcite .",
    "a given facet can have a high , or a low mobility depending on whether , or not , it contains such step sources .",
    "the high - to - low - mobility transitions of a facet during growth , if any , are due to step sources entering or leaving the facet , and are quite sharp , and thus easily identified on a macroscopic scale @xcite .    : thermal - gradient and growth axis .",

    "these authors then showed that introducing standard facet kinetics ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ) in the model should not alter these conclusions .",

    "this problem is a current challenge for phase - field numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "with regard to experimental investigations capable of casting light on the dynamics of thin wf patterns , we are aware of studies dealing with mesophase systems @xcite , but none of dealing with `` solid '' crystals .",
    "a reason for this is the frequent occurrence of large - amplitude plastic deformations called growth - induced deformation ( gid ) thereafter breaking up faceted solid crystals into a multitude of small grains during t - ds .",
    "the origin of gid , and the methods of keeping it from happening , if any , are still unclear .",
    "fabietti and trivedi @xcite studied gid during t - ds in impure naphthalene , which has the same crystallographic structure as biphenyl , but their observations were inconclusive as regards the possible existence of deformation - free thin cellular patterns . in this article , we report that gid did not occur during thin free growth ( t - fg ) of biphenyl crystals indicating that gid basically is a thermal - stress effect generated by the externally applied thermal gradient .",
    "most significantly , we found that gid was also lacking during t - ds when the ( deformation - free ) growth front was cellular . by triggering the cellular instability at an early stage of t - ds , it was thus possible to grow deformation - free steady wf patterns in impure biphenyl .",
    "we present a detailed study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gid in t - ds samples with single - crystal seeds .",
    "this study reveals that the first stage of gid is a long - range process , which occurs only in large - width crystals , and not in the narrow cells of the cellular patterns .",
    "finally , we report a first investigation of thin wf patterns in deformation - free biphenyl crystals for various orientations of the crystal with respect to the growth direction .",
    "biphenyl ( @xmath24 ) is a transparent substance , which crystallizes into a biaxial birefringent monoclinic phase at @xmath25c .",

    "crystals with ( 001 ) parallel to the sample plane are called ( 001)-oriented crystals .",

    "crystals deviating from the ( 001)-orientation are called `` tilted '' , and the angle of their basal plane and the sample plane is denoted @xmath38",
    ". crystals with their basal plane nearly perpendicular to the sample plane are called `` edge - on '' .",
    "the observations were performed in commercial biphenyl ( fluka , 99.9 % ) unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "a few experiments were made with biphenyl doped with 1 wgt% of camphor .",
    "the methods of preparation and observation of the samples are explained elsewhere @xcite , and need only to be briefly outlined here .",
    "the crucibles consist of two parallel glass plates separated by polymer spacers .",
    "their inner dimensions are of 60 mm along @xmath35 , 8 mm  ( width ) along @xmath16 , and 12  ( thickness ) along @xmath15 .",
    "a funnel - shaped grain selector is created near the cold end of the crucibles by using spacers of an appropriate shape ( fig .",
    "[ setupf ] ) .",
    "the crucibles are filled with the liquid compound under controlled argon atmosphere , quenched to room temperature , and sealed .",
    "they are then inserted into a t - fg or a t - ds setup , and observed in side view by videomicroscopy .",
    "polarized light was used in order to take benefit of the birefringence of the crystals .",
    "t - fg was carried out with a commercial hot stage ( instec , hs1-i ) mostly for the purpose of preparing single - crystal seeds for t - ds .",
    "the temperature distribution in the setup is not perfectly uniform , but has a shallow depression at the center of the window of observation .",
    "this feature can be utilized to grow single - crystal seeds .",
    "the temperature of a polycrystalline sample is increased until all the grains melt except the one ( the future seed ) that is located at the minimum of the temperature distribution .",
    "the melting is pursued until the seed detaches itself from the glass plates , is carried away by flows existing in the liquid , and redeposited with , generally , its basal facet closely aligned with the sample plane . the temperature",
    "is then decreased step by step in order to make this ( 001)-oriented single crystal grow without ( or with as little as possible ) morphological instability .",
    "it should be noted that , during this process , the crystal is a thin plate limited by two blocked ( deprived of step sources ) basal facets , which are basically not in contact with the glass walls .",
    "some crystals had a small residual misalignment and collided with a glass wall during growth .",
    "crystals that filled the sample without hitting the glass walls ( @xmath39 )   were selected as seeds for t - ds .",
    "these crystals kept a uniform optical contrast during growth indicating that no noticeable gid occurred during t - fg .",
    "the fully solidified samples were then slowly cooled to room temperature , and transferred to the t - ds setup . a weakly contrasted rectilinear",
    "striation parallel to the direction [ 010 ] appeared at @xmath4010k during cooling , and persisted in the non - melted part of the samples after they were inserted into the t - ds setup .",
    "however , they were not transmitted to the grown crystal during t - ds indicating that they did not pertain to the bulk of the crystal , but to the layer of matter comprised between the crystal and the glass walls that solidified during cooling to room temperature .",
    "the crystallographic orientation of the striae and the presence of microbubbles are suggestive of slip bands left by [ 010 ] dislocations gliding in the ( 100 ) plane .",
    "t - ds experiments were performed using a home - built stage made of two independent thermally regulated copper blocks separated by a several millimeters - wide gap , in which the solidification front sits . during this study , @xmath41 , unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "the translation velocity of the samples is stable to within @xmath42 in the explored range ( 0.1 - 30 ) .",
    "in addition to a standard t - ds stage , we used a new `` rotating t - ds stage '' , to be presented in a future publication , with which it is possible to rotate the sample about @xmath15 , that is , to change the in - plane orientation of the crystal during solidification .",
    "the microstructure of the non - melted part ( seed ) of the sample at the beginning of a t - ds run is an all - important experimental factor that can be largely controlled by an appropriate design of the first stages of t - ds .",
    "the main alternative is to include , or not , a low-@xmath0 growth through the grain selector prior to the t - ds run proper .",
    "a few as - quenched samples were solidified without grain selection , and exhibited a strongly faceted mode of growth . as a general rule ,",
    "as - quenched samples were solidified with grain selection , which led to a complete elimination of all the tilted grains ( see section [ gipdasq ] ) .    a cellular instability was observed during t - ds of ( 001)-oriented grains under conditions , which will be specified later on .",
    "we measured @xmath10 at @xmath43 in these grains by the method explained in ref .",
    "three types of samples must be distinguished : fresh samples of commercial biphenyl , samples of commercial biphenyl having undergone a t - fg or t - ds solidification / melting cycle at low @xmath0 ( as is the case of samples with single - crystal seeds ) designated as `` purified '' hereafter , and samples of camphor - doped biphenyl .",
    "we found @xmath44  in fresh undoped samples , @xmath45  in purified samples , and @xmath46  in camphor - doped samples .",
    "in t - fg as well as t - ds , biphenyl crystals exhibited only two types of facets , namely , low - mobility \\{001 } facets and high - mobility \\{110 } facets .",
    "we give experimental evidence of the respective kinetics of these facets .",
    "figure [ biphfreeseq]a shows a spatiotemporal ( st ) diagram _i.e . _ a time series of binarized profiles of the growth front displayed in the reference frame of the sample of a ( 001)-oriented biphenyl crystal during t - fg .",
    "the crystal first grows from a circular to a rhombus shape limited by \\{110 } facets , then undergoes an impurity - driven ( mullins - sekerka ) instability , and finally settles into a steady dendritic regime with dendrites pointing in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions .",
    "the \\{110 } facets are linked to each other by smooth rounded regions indicating that no forbidden orientation range exists in the non - faceted parts of the solid - liquid interface .",
    "the faceted parts of the profile remained rectilinear within the measurement uncertainty during the process .",
    "the measured angle between [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath320 ] facets was of @xmath49 .",
    "the small difference between this angle , and the one deduced from crystallographic data , if significant , is attributable to differences in temperature and composition .",
    "the slight crystallographic tilt of the \\{110 } facets with respect to @xmath15 was not resolved , but a difference in contrast between the faceted and rounded part of the interface was apparent , revealing a difference ( planar versus rounded ) in 3d shape between these two regions .",
    "the time evolution of the tip velocity @xmath0 ( figure [ biphfreeseq].b ) shows that \\{110 } facets developed through a perfectly smooth process indicating that no discontinuity in the kinetic coefficient is associated with \\{110 } facets .",

    "figure [ nucleation ] shows a deep liquid pocket due to the mutual impingement of edge - on crystals adhering to the glass walls through their nonfaceted extremities .",
    "a sporadic nucleation of macrosk.jpg on the basal facets bordering the liquid pocket took place as @xmath20 progressively increased until the whole pocket was suddenly filled by a polycrystal through an `` explosive '' nucleation process .",
    "the distance of the nucleation site from the growth front was of about  1.5 mm corresponding to a temperature difference of about 9k .        in conclusion ,",
    "the known absence of dislocations capable of serving as step sources for ( 001 ) facets namely , dislocations with a [ 001 ] burgers vector in biphenyl crystals is a sufficient explanation of the low mobility of these facets .",
    "reciprocally , the observed high mobility of \\{110 } facets must be attributed to dislocations with [ 100 ] or [ 010 ] burgers vector intersecting these facets .",
    "the only acceptable alternative would be the proximity of a roughening transition , but this seems very unlikely given the large extension of these facets , and the small growth rates considered in this study .",
    "however , the mechanisms by which \\{110 } facets are fed with dislocations during growth even when the growth morphology becomes very complex , are unknown . anticipating on the observations presented below , we note that one , and probably the most important of these mechanisms is the plastic deformation generated by thermal stresses illustrated by gid .",
    "the formation of a stratified microstructure , or equivalently of ( 001 ) twist boundaries , during growth explained in section [ gipdsingle ] may also contribute , but it is not certain that these boundaries survive the morphological transitions of the system ( see fig . [ feuillets ] below ) .",
    "we performed t - ds experiments in a series of samples with single - crystal seeds with various in - plane orientations at values of @xmath0 ranging from 0.5 to 30 . in these samples , @xmath51 , as previously mentioned .",
    "we observed gid processes with similar characteristics in all the experiments .",
    "this , and the fact that gid does not occur during t - fg , may suffice to establish that gid is not due to a cellular instability , but most probably to thermal stresses .",
    "however , to substantiate this conclusion , and because of the remarkable features of gid in our experiments , we study the geometry of this process in detail .",
    "gid processes that took place in two different crystals oriented , one asymmetrically , and the other symmetrically , with respect to the t - ds setup are shown in figures [ gid24 ] and [ gida ] , respectively .",
    "both processes go through the following three successive stages : stage 1 , which starts from the beginning of the solidification , and consists of the progressive amplification of a smooth contrast modulation extending along @xmath16 ( fig . [ levelplots ] ) ; stage 2 , which begins with the sudden creation of grain boundaries at positions corresponding to the extrema of the contrast modulation ; stage 3 , during which crystal - glass collisions followed by the appearance of new grains lead to a fully polycrystalline microstructure .    .",

    "a full understanding of such a process under the conditions of our experiments ( strong confinement of the system and elasto - plastic anisotropy of the solid ) is notoriously beyond reach at present , but some interesting semi - quantitative remarks can be made .",
    "various observations indicated that the distortion field existing in the crystal during stage 1 mostly consisted of rotations of the crystal lattice about the [ 100 ] axis of the crystal .",
    "such a distortion field favors the formation of tilt boundaries ( arrays of [ 010 ] edge dislocations ) in ( 010 ) planes , in agreement with the fact that the grain boundaries appearing at the onset of stage 2 were approximately parallel to [ 100 ] in all the samples studied ( figs .",

    "these observations indicate that @xmath59 and @xmath60 were essentially independent of @xmath0 , as could be expected from the fact that the plastic deformation started from the beginning of the solidification .",
    "this suggests that these lengths are mostly determined by the geometry of the experiment .",
    "contrary to stage 1 , stages 2 and 3 presented features , which depended on the in - plane orientation of the crystal , and on additional , ill - known , geometrical factors .",

    "[ gida ] and [ gidb ] , which show gid processes that occurred during two successive runs at different values of @xmath0 in the same ( 001)[100]-oriented sample .",
    "the common features of the two runs are that the gid - induced microstructure kept the mirror symmetry about @xmath64 of the initial crystal as well as the periodicity inherited from stage 1 ( in contrast with what occurred in asymmetrically oriented samples ) , and that thickness fringes appeared near the grain boundaries at , or a short time after , the onset of stage 2 .",
