    "the x - ray pulsar 1e 2259 + 586 is located at the geometric center of the semi - circular shell of diffuse x - ray emission of the supernova remnant g109@xmath31.0 ( gregory & fahlman 1980 ) .",
    "radio observations indicate that the age of g109@xmath31.0 is about @xmath4 yr and the distance to it is 3.64.7 kpc ( hughes et al .",
    "the pulse frequency of the pulsar is 0.1433 hz ( pulse period 6.8 sec ) and the average spin down rate since its discovery is @xmath5 hz s@xmath1 .",
    "if 1e 2259 + 586 is an isolated , spinning - down pulsar , this rate yields a rotational energy loss of 10@xmath6 erg s@xmath1 which is much less then the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of @xmath710@xmath8 erg s@xmath1 ( corbet 1995 ) .",
    "koyama et al . , ( 1987 , 1989 ) claimed that the spin - down rate and unabsorbed x - ray luminosity can be understood if 1e 2259 + 586 is in a binary system with a neutron star magnetic field of 5@xmath9 gauss and spinning close to the equilibrium period ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "however , efforts to find orbitally induced doppler shifts in the x - ray pulsations which would reveal the binary period have been unsuccessful .",
    "the upper limits of @xmath10 from previous missions such as einstein , exosat , ginga and rosat have been very small .",
    "for example , recent rxte observations ( mereghetti et al . , 1998 ) have given the lowest upper limit @xmath11 msec at the 99% confidence level . according to these new upper limits ,",
    "if 1e 2259 + 586 is in a binary system , its companion star must be either a white dwarf , or a helium - burning star with @xmath12 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "alternatively , 1e 2259 + 586 could be an isolated star which is accreting from a disk and is formed by remnants of the common envelope evolution of a high - mass x - ray binary ( van paradijs et al . 1995 , ghosh et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "analyses of the rosat observations ( baykal & swank 1996 ) have shown that the source is not steadily spinning - down . a spin - up episode",
    "which is superposed on a long term spin - down trend was found .",
    "the deviations from the secular spin - down trend are also consistent with other accretion powered x - ray pulsars ( baykal & gelman 1993 ) , which are several orders of magnitude greater than those of radio pulsars .",
    "this result favors accretion onto a neutron star from a very low mass companion or from a residual disk . in this research note",
    ", we present the pulse timing results and x - ray spectrum of 1e 2259 + 586 from rxte observations .",
    "the main goal of these new rxte observations is to resolve the pulse frequency derivative @xmath13 during the observation time span and measure the source x - ray luminosity .",
    "these quantities enable us to further test the current accretion hypothesis for this source .",
    "1e 2259 + 586 was observed between 1997 february 25 and march 26 on 5 different days separated from each other by approximately one week .",
    "each 25 ksec observation was taken in approximately one day .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected with the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al .",
    "the pca instrument consists of an array of 5 proportional counters operating in the 260 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000 @xmath14 and a field of view , @xmath15 fwhm .",
    "background light curves and the pulse height amplitudes are generated using background estimator models based upon the rate of very large events ( vle ) , spacecraft activation and cosmic x - ray emission with the standard pca analysis tools and are subtracted from the source light curve obtained from the good xenon event data .",
    "after correcting the background subtracted light curves with respect to the barycenter of the solar system , data sets in each observation were folded on statistically independent trial periods ( leahy et al .",
    "a master pulse was constructed by folding the data on the period giving the maximum @xmath16 .",
    "the master pulse with 55 phase bins was represented by its fourier harmonics ( deeter & boynton 1985 ) and cross - correlated with the harmonic representation of average pulse profiles from each observation .",
    "the pulse arrival times so obtained are represented in fig .",
    "1 . the quadratic trend of pulse arrival times is a direct measure of the change of the pulse frequency during the observation ( or intrinsic pulse frequency derivative ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pulse phase offset deduced from the pulse timing analysis , @xmath19 is the mid - time of the observation , @xmath20 is the phase offset at t@xmath21 , @xmath22 is the deviation from the mean pulse frequency ( or additive correction to the pulse frequency ) , and @xmath23 is the pulse frequency derivative of the source .",
    "table 1 presents the timing solution of 1e 2259 + 586 from our rxte observations .",
    "the pulse frequency derivative obtained from the quadratic trend of the pulse timing analysis is @xmath24 hz s@xmath1 which is consistent with the average spin - down rate over a time span of 19 years , @xmath25 hz s@xmath1 .",
    "2 presents the previous pulse frequency history of 1e 2259 + 586 together with the new rxte observation .",
    "the background spectrum was calculated using the same background estimator models based upon the rate of very large events ( vle ) , spacecraft activation and cosmic x - ray emission as used to calculate background light curves .",
    "the resultant background subtracted spectrum in the energy range 2 - 10 kev yields x - ray luminosity @xmath27 erg s@xmath1 which is consistent with that obtained from asca and sax measurements in 2 - 10 kev ( corbet et al .",
    ", 1995 , parmar et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the best fitting power law x - ray spectrum with column density n@xmath28=(2.2@xmath29 0.8 ) @xmath30 10@xmath31 @xmath32 and photon index 4.78 is presented in fig .",
    "the background contamination from the supernova remnant is only a few percent of the total source flux ( rho & petre 1997 ) . asca and beppo",
    "sax observations have found a soft black - body component with a temperature of 0.44 kev ( corbet et al .",
    "1995 , parmar et al .",
    "our fits to the x - ray spectra do not resolve the soft black - body component since the rxte / pca detectors are insensitive to energies less than about 2 kev .",
    "there is no evidence for any deviation from a power law that might be attributable to a cyclotron feature .      in searching for orbital doppler modulation , orbital periods from @xmath33 sec to @xmath34 sec",
    "were considered by oversampling the independent fourier periods ( leahy 1983 ) by a factor of 4 . for each trial orbital period , 8 pulse profiles are obtained at the different intervals of the orbital phase by correcting the light curve for the secular spin - down rate and folding the light curve at the the pulse period .",
    "the resulting pulse profiles were cross - correlated with the master pulse , which was obtained from all observations . to search for any sinusoidal modulation in the 8 pulse arrival times ,",
    "fourier amplitudes of the arrival times were computed and are presented as a function of the trial orbital period in fig .",
    "4 . in the absence of an orbital signal ,",
    "the expected distribution of fourier amplitudes is the @xmath35 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom ( van der klis 1989 ) . as seen in fig .",
    "4 , no significant signal detection is found at the 99% confidence level .",
    "the upper limit for any undetected signal is estimated as @xmath36 light - s , which is very close to the earlier upper limit given by mereghetti et al .",
    "( we note that a slight improvement of the upper limit arises from the better statistics due to the longer rxte observation with respect to previous observations ) the above upper limits on doppler shifts confirms that if the 1e 2259 + 586 is in a binary system , then the companion star must be either a white dwarf , or a helium - burning star ( mereghetti et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "[ [ torque - and - x - ray - luminosity - changes - in - accretion - powered - disk - fed - binaries - and-1e-2259586 ] ] torque and x - ray luminosity changes in accretion powered disk fed binaries and 1e 2259 + 586 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in disk - fed systems , the accretion onto the neutron star is believed to be from a keplerian disk ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "the torque on the neutron star is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the specific angular momentum added by a keplerian disk to the neutron star at the inner disk edge @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the alfven radius , @xmath41 is the neutron star magnetic moment , @xmath42 is a dimensionless function that measures the variation of the accretion torque as estimated by the fastness parameter @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath44 is the critical fastness parameter at which the accretion torque is expected to vanish ( @xmath45 depending on the electrodynamics of the disk , lamb 1989 ) . in this model",
    ", the torque will cause a spin - up if the neutron star is rotating slowly ( @xmath46 ) in the same sense as the circulation in the disk , or spin - down , if it is rotating in the opposite sense ( see lamb 1991 ) . even if the neutron star is rotating in the same sense as the disk flow , the torque will spin - down the neutron star if it is rotating too rapidly ( @xmath47 ) . in such a model",
    "one should see positive correlation between angular acceleration ( @xmath48 ) and mass accretion rate ( @xmath49 ) if the disk is rotating in the same sense as the neutron star .",
    "if the flow is from roche lobe overflow then the accreting material carries positive specific angular momentum @xmath50 , therefore it is hard to imagine accretion flow reversals and hence the spin - up / down torques should be correlated with mass accretion rate @xmath49 .    in ginga observations the source had flux levels a factor of two higher than average ( iwasawa et al .",
    "this implied that the mass accretion rate on the source is indeed variable and fluctuations in the spin - down rate and possible spin - up trends should be expected ( baykal & swank 1996 ) .",
    "however , our rxte observations found the source with an x - ray flux consistent with the secular spin - down .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to find the secular spin - down rate from pulse arrival times , although this observation gives the spin - down rate of the source over the shortest observing interval since the discovery of the source .",
    "recent observations of accreting neutron stars have shown stochastic spin - up / down trends on time scales from days to a few years ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) . in intervals between stochastic changes",
    "disk - fed sources show secular spin - up or down trends with lower values of noise strength ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "some of the sources switch from spin - up to spin - down states without showing great changes in their mass accretion rates ( bildsten et al .",
    "these unusual behaviors led baykal ( 1997 ) and nelson et al . (",
    "1997 ) to the possibility of retrograde circulation of accretion disks .",
    "gx 4 + 1 shows correlation between the x - ray flux and the spin - down rate ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997 ) which may suggest a retrograde accretion disk . in the application of the above observational results and current accretion theory to 1e 2259 + 586 , the spin - down rate should decrease or it should switch to spin - up at higher accretion rates ( higher x - ray flux ) . on the other hand if the source has a very unusual counter - rotating accretion disk , in the high state the spin - down rate should increase with respect to the low state .",
    "future x - ray observations at a high state could address this important question ."
