    "for @xmath7 we obtain @xmath8 , hence zero - temperature limit of this algorithm can be rewritten as a special case of the so called generalized zero - temperature glauber dynamics in which flips for @xmath9 are forbidden and the probability of flipping @xmath4th spin in case of @xmath7 is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "another example of such a generalized dynamics ( which we call in this paper inflow dynamics ) is the zero - temperature limit of the original glauber dynamics @xcite  the corresponding flipping probability is @xmath11 .",
    "it occurred that for @xmath10 the critical value of @xmath0 exists above which the system never reaches the final ferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "this critical value was determined by measuring the evolution of active bonds ( bond is active if it connects two sites with opposite spins ) .",

    "@xcite report , about 20 years ago , for no good reason the customers of a local bank in singapore began drawing out their money in a frenzy .",
    "the run on this respected bank remained a mystery until much later , when researchers interviewing participants discovered its peculiar cause : an unexpected bus strike had created an abnormally large crowd waiting at the bus stop in front of the bank that day . mistaking the gathering for a crush of customers poised to withdraw their funds from a failing bank , passersby panicked and got in line to withdraw their deposits , which led more passersby to do the same .",
    "soon illusion had become reality and , shortly after opening its doors , the bank was forced to close to avoid ruin .",
    "this is only one of many examples of social validation described in social psychology textbooks @xcite .",
    "most people feel that behaviors become more valid when many others are performing them .",
    "although the tendency to follow the lead of our peers can drive to misguided behavior , most of the time it sends us in right directions , toward correct choices . on the other hand",
    ", it happens that people often follow others even if they believe that the group may be in error .",
    "the research of solomon asch in 1955 demonstrated that , when faced with a strong group consensus , people often conform even if they believe that the group may be in error @xcite . however , even a single visible dissenter from the group s position emboldens others to resist conformity .",
    "a number of later experiments showed that an individual who breaks the unanimity principle reduces social pressure of the group dramatically @xcite .",
    "this observation was recently expressed in a simple one dimensional usdf ( ` united we stand , divided we fall ' ) model of opinion formation @xcite .",
    "the model was later renamed ` the sznajd model ' by stauffer @xcite and generalized on a two dimensional square lattice .    the crucial difference between the sznajd model and other ising - type models of opinion dynamics @xcite or zero - temperature glauber dynamics @xcite is that information flows outward from the center nodes to the surrounding neighborhood ( so called outflow dynamics @xcite ) and not the other way around . in spite of this difference",
    ", it has been suggested @xcite , that outflow dynamics is equivalent with zero - temperature glauber dynamics ( inflow dynamics ) for the ising ferromagnet with the nearest neighbors interactions .",
    "the updating of an extended group of spins in the ising model with zero - temperature glauber kinetics @xcite was considered by newman and stein @xcite , lipowski @xcite and later on by @xcite ( and referenced therein ) .",
    "outflow dynamics in two dimensions was studied by stauffer et al .",
    "@xcite and later on by others ( for reviews see @xcite .",
    "qualitative differences between outflow and inflow dynamics in two dimensions have been shown . under outflow dynamics",
    "the system always relaxes to the ferromagnetic steady state . on the contrary",
    ", an ising ferromagnet has a large number of metastable states with respect to the glauber spin - flip dynamics .",
    "therefore , at zero temperature the system could get stuck forever in one of these states @xcite . on the other hand , since there are no metastable states in one dimension , the only possible final states are all spins up or all spins down , analogously to outflow dynamics .",
    "let us recall two differences between settings of inflow and outflow dynamics :    1 .   under zero - temperature glauber ( inflow )",
    "dynamics conformity is caused by majority , in contrast to outflow dynamics where unanimity is required .",
    "of course , in one dimension , when a pair of spins is influencing others , majority is equivalent to unanimity  this difference is important only in higher dimensions .",
    "2 .   under inflow dynamics the center spin",
    "is influenced by its nearest neighbors , while under outflow dynamics information flows from the center spins to the neighborhood .",
    "nevertheless , under random sequential updating , both dynamics seem to be equivalent in one dimension , except for one value of parameter @xmath14 , which describes the probability of flipping the spin in lack of majority .",
    "this particular value @xmath14 corresponds to the constrained zero - temperature glauber dynamics where the only possible moves are flips of isolated spins .",
    "the system , therefore , eventually reaches a blocked configuration , where there is no isolated spin @xcite .    in the previous paper",
    "we have decided to examine differences between both dynamics in one dimension under several types of updating @xcite .",
    "this issue seems to be quite important in the field of sociophysics , since several social experiments showed that updating plays an important role in opinion dynamics .",
    "for example , two groups of two people influence an individual stronger to conform than one group of four people @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", updating schemes may play a prominent role in one - dimensional ising model at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "probably neither a completely synchronous nor a random sequential update is realistic for natural systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , in @xcite we have introduced @xmath0-parallel updating ( a randomly chosen fraction @xmath0 of spins is updated synchronously ) and shown that outflow dynamics is much more influenced by the type of updating than inflow dynamics .",
    "the results in our previous paper were intriguing , but preliminary .",
    "we looked at the mean relaxation time as a function of the initial fraction of randomly distributed up - spins only for several values of @xmath0 and @xmath13 . based on our previous simulations we noticed that :    1 .   within @xmath15-parallel updating ( i.e. random sequential updating )",
    "the relaxation is much slower for inflow than for outflow dynamics . 2 .   within @xmath16-parallel updating ( i.e. deterministic synchronous updating )",
    "the relaxation under outflow is slower than under inflow dynamics .",
    "3 .   in general ,",
    "the relaxation times decay with @xmath13 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 is much stronger for outflow dynamics . for inflow dynamics",
    "the mean relaxation time is almost the same for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "as we show in this paper , the above results are valid only for some values of @xmath13 and @xmath0 .",
    "generally , the parameter space of our model is 3-dimensional and consists of : @xmath0 ( fraction of spins updated synchronously ) , @xmath13 ( probability of flipping a spin in lack of majority ) and @xmath17 ( initial fraction of up - spins ) .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on random initial conditions with equal number of up and down spins , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "this value of @xmath17 is the most frequently chosen in the computer simulations since it corresponds to high temperature situation in which magnetization is equal to 0 . on the other hand ,",
    "condition @xmath18 corresponds to the social situation in which public opinion is equal to zero , i.e. a democratic stalemate in which the society is not able to make any common decision .",
    "from such an initial condition , under one - dimensional zero - temperature outflow or inflow dynamics with random sequential updating , the system will eventually reach with equal probability one of two possible consensus states ",
    "all spins up or all spins down .",
    "obviously , the mean relaxation time for @xmath18 is larger than for any other value of @xmath17 .",
    "for all these reasons the initial state with @xmath18 is the most interesting case . on the other hand ,",
    "focusing on this particular value of @xmath17 allows us to limit the parameter space ( @xmath19 ) to ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in particular , we show in this paper :    * how the mean relaxation time @xmath21 scales with the system size @xmath1 , * what is the exact dependence between the mean relaxation time and parameters @xmath0 and @xmath13 , * what is the ratio between the mean relaxation time for inflow and for outflow dynamics as the function of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "let us begin with recalling the definitions of inflow and outflow dynamics , as well as , the idea of the so called @xmath0-parallel updating .",
    "the system consists of @xmath1 ising spins @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) placed on the one - dimensional lattice with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we consider a quench from the infinite temperature to the zero temperature , and let the system then evolve using one of two dynamics - the inflow and the outflow dynamics .",
    "generalized zero - temperature glauber ( inflow ) dynamics can be defined without using the idea of the energy @xcite : @xmath24    similarly we can define the outflow dynamics .",
    "recently @xcite , we have introduced slight modifications with respect to the original outflow rule : choose pair of neighbors and if they both are in the same state , then adjust one ( instead of two ) of its neighbors ( chosen randomly on left or right with equal probability @xmath25 ) to the common state . because this way at most one spin is flipped in one step , while in original formulation",
    "two can be flipped simultaneously , the time must be rescaled by factor @xmath26 .",
    "we measure the time so that the speed of all processes remains constant when @xmath27 , so normally one update takes time @xmath15 . here , instead , we consider also the factor @xmath26 , so single update takes time @xmath28 .",
    "our modification eliminates some correlations due to simultaneous flip of spins at distance @xmath29 .",
    "however , if we look at later stages of the evolution , where typically the domains are larger than @xmath30 , simultaneous flips occurs very rarely .",
    "therefore , we do not expect any substantial difference .",
    "indeed , computer simulations confirmed our expectations - only time has to be rescaled . on the other hand",
    ", the modification simplifies the analytical treatment and allowed us to find exact formula for the exit probability @xcite . here",
    "we go even further and adjust left ( instead of random ) neighbor of chosen pair :    @xmath31    we have checked by the computer monte carlo simulations that such a modification does not change results in the case of random sequential updating .",
    "analogously to the case with one random neighbor @xcite , only the time has to be rescaled by factor @xmath30 in respect to the original rule in which two spins are changed in each elementary time step ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig0 ] ) .",
    "we introduce such a modification to simplify the case with synchronous updating .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that the case of synchronous updating for the zero - temperature glauber dynamics is fully deterministic . by introducing modification described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : out ] ) we avoid randomness in the case of synchronous updating for the outflow dynamics .",
    "up - spins for the modified ( 1nn ) and original ( 2nn ) outflow dynamics in one dimension . in the modified version",
    "we adjust only left neighbor of chosen pair , so at most one spin is flipped in one elementary step while in original formulation two can be flipped simultaneously . therefore in case of modified version the time was rescaled by factor @xmath26 .",
    "it should be noticed that in computer simulations time is measured in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) . as usual , one mcs consist of @xmath1 elementary updating .",
    "since we investigate the relaxation process we simulate the system as long as it reach the final state with all spins up or down . the average number of mcs needed to reach the final step depends on the initial concentration of up - spins and scales with the system size as @xmath32 analogously to the voter model @xcite .",
    "the results presented on the plot are averaged over @xmath33 samples . ]",
    "seemingly there is only one small difference between both dynamics  under inflow ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : in ] ) ) spin @xmath34 is flipped according to its two nearest neighbors @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and under outflow ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : out ] ) ) according to its neighboring pair @xmath37 .",
    "this small difference has consequences even for random sequential updating - for @xmath38 we have constrained inflow dynamics where the only possible moves are flips of isolated spins and the system , therefore , eventually reaches a blocked configuration , where there is no isolated spin @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , under outflow dynamics with @xmath38 the system will always eventually reach consensus or , in other words , ferromagnetic state . however , apart from the limit value of the flipping probability @xmath38 both dynamics seem to be qualitatively equivalent under random sequential updating . to see more differences between dynamics we have introduced @xmath0-parallel updating @xcite . within this updating a randomly chosen fraction @xmath0 of spins",
    "is updated synchronously .",
