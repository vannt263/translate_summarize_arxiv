    "throughout this paper , we assume the truth of the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) , and we let @xmath0 denote the ordinate of the @xmath1-th non - trivial zero of @xmath2 .",
    "hejhal  @xcite assumed the rh and a weak consequence of montgomery s  @xcite pair - correlation conjecture , namely that for some @xmath3 , there is a constant @xmath4 such that @xmath5    holds for all @xmath6 . under these assumptions , he proved the following central limit theorem : for @xmath7 , @xmath8    so under these assumptions , @xmath9 , suitably normalized , converges in distribution over fixed ranges to a standard normal variable . to obtain more precise information about the tails of the distribution",
    ", we consider the moments    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the zero counting function .",
    "notice that @xmath12 is defined for all @xmath13 provided the zeros of @xmath2 are simple , as is widely believed .",
    "gonek  @xcite  @xcite carried out an extensive study of @xmath12 .",
    "he proved , under the assumption of the rh , that @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "it was suggested by gonek  @xcite , and independently by hejhal  @xcite , that @xmath12 is on the order of @xmath16 .",
    "ng  @xcite proved , under the rh , that @xmath17 is order of @xmath18 , which is in agreement with that suggestion .",
    "hughes , keating , and oconnell  @xcite , applied the random matrix philosophy ( e.g. see  @xcite ) , which predicts that certain behaviors of @xmath19-functions are mimicked statistically by characteristic polynomials of large matrices from the classical compact groups .",
    "this led them to predict that for re(@xmath13 ) @xmath20 ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the barnes g - function , and @xmath23 is an `` arithmetic factor . '' the conjecture ( [ eq : hkc ] ) is consistent with previous theorems and conjectures .",
    "recently , conrey and snaith  @xcite , assuming the ratios conjecture , gave lower order terms in asymptotic expansions for @xmath24 and @xmath17 .",
    "they conjectured the existence of certain polynomials @xmath25 , for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , such that    @xmath28    the conjecture for the case @xmath26 was subsequently proved by milinovich  @xcite , assuming the rh .",
    "it is expected that such polynomials exist for other integer values of @xmath29 as well .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study numerically various statistics of the derivative of the zeta function at its zeros . in particular , we consider the distribution of @xmath9 , moments of @xmath30 , and correlations among moments .",
    "the goal is to obtain more detailed information about the derivative at zeros , and to enable comparison with various conjectured and known asymptotics .",
    "our computations rely on large sets of zeros at large heights that are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we find that the empirical distribution of @xmath9 , normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation one , agrees generally well with the limiting normal distribution proved by hejhal , as shown in figure  [ distder23 ] .",
    "but the empirical mean and standard deviation pre - normalization are noticeably different from predicted ones .",
    "also , as shown in figure  [ tailder23 ] , the frequency of very small normalized values of @xmath9 is higher than predicted by a standard normal distribution , while the frequency of very large normalized values is lower than predicted . since these differences appear to decrease steadily with height , however , they are probably not significant .    to examine the tails of the distribution of @xmath31 , we present data for the moments of @xmath30 over short ranges :    @xmath32    for large @xmath13 , the empirical values of @xmath33 deviate substantially from the values suggested by the leading term prediction ( [ eq : hkc ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising . because for @xmath13 large relative to @xmath34 , the contribution of lower order terms is likely to dominate , and so the leading term asymptotic on its own",
    "may not suffice .",
    "furthermore , the said deviations decrease steadily with height and they occur in a generally uniform way for roughly @xmath35 , so they are consistent with the effect of `` lower order terms '' still being felt even at such relatively large heights .    in the specific cases of the second and fourth moments of @xmath30 ,",
    "the conjectures of conrey and snaith  @xcite supply lower order terms , and the agreement with the data is much better , as shown in table  [ csmomentder23 ] . for sufficiently many values of @xmath34 , then solving the resulting system of equations .",
    "however , this did not yield good approximations of the coefficients ( even for small @xmath13 ) , which is not surprising , since the scale is logarithmic and the conrey and snaith expansion is only asymptotic . ]    as @xmath13 increases , the observed variability in the moments of @xmath30 is more extreme , but it is still significantly less than we previously encountered in the moments of @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) . to illustrate , our computations of the twelfth moment of @xmath30 over 15 separate sets of @xmath37 zeros each ( near the @xmath38-rd zero ) show that the ratio of highest to lowest moment among the 15 twelfth moments thus obtained was 2.36 .",
    "in contrast , that ratio for the twelfth moment of @xmath36 was 16.34 , which is significantly larger ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the variability in statistical data for @xmath30 is considerably less than the variability in statistical data for @xmath36 .",
    "it is not immediately clear why this should be so , considering , for instance , that the central limit theorem for @xmath9 is only conditional , while that for @xmath39 is not , and both theorems scale by the same asymptotic variance . in the case of negative moments , our data is in agreement with gonek s conjecture ( @xcite ) @xmath40 as @xmath15 . but starting at @xmath41 , and as @xmath13 decreases , the empirical behavior of negative moments becomes rapidly more erratic . for example , using the same 15 zero sets near the @xmath38-rd zero mentioned previously , the ratio of highest to lowest negative moment among them gets very large as @xmath13 decreases ; we obtain : 1.03 , 8.45 , 178.49 , and 17240.99 , for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively ( this can be deduced easily from table  [ nmomentder23 ] ) .",
    "notice that the point @xmath41 is special because it is where the leading term prediction ( [ eq : hkc ] ) first breaks down due to a pole of order 1 in the ratio of barnes g - functions .",
    "extreme values of negative moments are caused by very few zeros .",
    "when @xmath41 , for instance , the largest observed moment among our 15 sets is @xmath44 . about 87% of this value",
    "is contributed by 4 zeros where @xmath30 is small and equal to 0.002439 , 0.002453 , 0.004388 , and 0.004365 . by computing them in two ways , using the odlyzko - schnhage algorithm , and using the straightforward riemann - siegel formula",
    "; the results from the two methods agreed to within @xmath45 such small values of @xmath46 typically occur at pairs of consecutive zeros that are close to each other .",
    "for example , the values 0.002439 and 0.002453 occur at the following two consecutive zero ordinates :    @xmath47    the above pair of zeros is separated by 0.00032 , which is about 1/400 times the average spacing of zeros at that height ( which is @xmath48 ) .",
    "to investigate possible correlations among values of @xmath49 , we studied numerically the ( shifted moment ) function :    @xmath50    we plotted @xmath51 , for several choices of @xmath13 , @xmath34 , and @xmath52 , and as @xmath53 varies .",
    "the resulting plots indicate there are long - range correlations among the values of the derivative at zeros .",
    "unexpectedly , the tail of @xmath54 ( figure  [ corrder23 ] ; right plot ) strongly resembles the tail for the shifted fourth moment of @xmath36 ( figure  4 in @xcite ) .    to better understand these correlations ,",
    "we considered the `` spectrum '' of @xmath9 ; see ( [ eq : specf ] ) for a definition .",
    "a plot of the spectrum reveals sharp spikes , shown in figure  [ fftder23 ] .",
    "these spikes can be explained heuristically by applying techniques already used by fujii @xcite and gonek @xcite to estimate sums involving @xmath55 .",
    "conjecture ( [ eq : derclt1 ] ) suggests the mean and standard deviation of @xmath56 for zeros from near @xmath57 ( i.e. near the @xmath38-rd zero ) are about 2.0 and 1.4 , respectively .",
    "this is far from the empirical mean and standard deviations listed in table  [ sum0 ] , which are 3.4907 and 1.0977 .",
    "change very little across different zero sets near the same height .",
    "for example , using a different set of @xmath58 zeros near the @xmath38-rd zero , the empirical mean is 3.4907 and the empirical standard deviation is 1.0978 , which are very close the numbers listed in table  [ sum0 ] .",
    "we note that the empirical mean and standard deviation are closer to the values suggested by the central limit theorem for characteristic polynomials of unitary matrices ( see @xcite ) , which are 3.47 and 1.12 . ] since these quantities grow very slowly ( like @xmath59 ) , these differences are probably not significant .",
    ".summary statistics for @xmath9 using sets of @xmath60 zeros from different heights the column `` zero '' lists the zero number near which the set is located .",
    "sd stands for standard deviation .",
    "[ sum0 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     starting with the investigations of @xcite , several long - range correlations have been found experimentally in zeta function statistics .",
    "such correlations are not present in random matrices , but do appear in some dynamical systems that for certain ranges are modeled by random matrices .",
    "so far all the zeta function correlations of this nature have been explained ( at least numerically and heuristically ) by relating them to known properties of the zeta function , such as explicit formulas that relate primes to zeros .",
    "a natural question is whether such correlations arise among values of @xmath55 .    in order to detect correlations among values of @xmath30 ,",
    "consider    @xmath61    we computed this shifted moment function for various choices of @xmath53 , @xmath34 , and @xmath52 .",
    "( we also considered similar sums with exponents other than 4 , but for simplicity do not discuss them here . ) figure  [ corrder23 ] presents some of our results near the @xmath62-th and @xmath38-rd zeros , and with @xmath52 spanning about @xmath60 zeros in both cases .",
    "the figure shows that correlations do exist and persist over long ranges .",
    "also , the shape of @xmath54 near the @xmath62-th zero is similar to that near the @xmath38-rd zero , except the former has higher peaks , and covers the range @xmath63 , as opposed to @xmath64 , which suggests oscillations scale as @xmath65 .",
    "we remark the plot of @xmath54 in figure  [ corrder23 ] ( right plot ) is similar to a plot in @xcite of the shifted fourth moment of the zeta function on the critical line :    @xmath66    which we reproduce here in figure  [ smg2 ] for the convenience of the reader .     using @xmath60 zeros near the @xmath62-th ( left plot ) and the @xmath38-rd zero ( right plot),title=\"fig : \" ]    using @xmath60 zeros near the @xmath62-th ( left plot ) and the @xmath38-rd zero ( right plot),title=\"fig : \" ]    , with @xmath67 , near the @xmath38-rd zero , drawn for @xmath68 a multiple of @xmath69 .",
    "the dashed line is a sine kernel . ]    to explain observed correlations , we numerically calculated the function :    @xmath70    which is related to long - range periodicities in @xmath55 . assuming the rh , fujii  @xcite supplied the following asymptotic formula in the case @xmath71 :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 ( the euler constant ) and @xmath74 .",
    "empirical values of @xmath75 agree well with formula ( [ eq : fuj ] ) .",
    "for example , with @xmath52 spanning @xmath76 zeros , we obtain @xmath77 near the @xmath78-zero , and we obtain @xmath79 near the @xmath38-rd zero . but as @xmath80 increases , @xmath81 experiences sharp spikes for certain @xmath80 , as shown in figure  [ fftder23 ] , which depicts the segment @xmath82 ( in the remaining portion @xmath83 , the spikes get progressively denser ) .",
    "the sharp spikes in figure  [ fftder23 ] show the existence of long - range periodicities among values of @xmath55 .",
    "these spikes , as well as the correlations described above , are not unexpected . they can be demonstrated to follow from the properties of the zeta function , by estimating proper contour integrals .",
    "such methods were used for continuous averages by ingham @xcite and even others before him , and for discrete averages over zeros by gonek  @xcite and fujii  @xcite .",
    "the main step involves integration of @xmath84 , and estimates of such integrals .    applying such methods",
    "to @xmath85 suggests that the function    @xmath86    experiences large spikes at approximately @xmath87 . for by a heuristic argument involving the ( very ) regular spacing of zeros",
    "one expects that @xmath88 in the definition of @xmath89 can be replaced by @xmath1 without too much error ( see @xcite for a similar argument in the context of long - range correlations in zero spacings ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 should behave similarly to @xmath89 .",
    "are almost unchanged if instead of plotting @xmath81 we plot @xmath89 . ] in particular , we expect the @xmath90-th spike in figure  [ fftder23 ] to occur at approximately @xmath91 , and that agrees well with the evidence of the graphs .    ,",

    "@xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 , it suffices to compute @xmath98 .",
    "to do so , we used the numerical differentiation formula ( taylor expansion ) @xmath99    where the remainder term in ( [ eq : numdiff ] ) satisfies @xmath100    we chose @xmath101 , and approximated the derivative by @xmath102    to evaluate @xmath95 at individual points , we used a version of the odlyzko - schnhage algorithm  @xcite implemented by the second author  @xcite .",
    "if the point - wise evaluations of @xmath103 and @xmath104 via this implementation are accurate to within @xmath105 each , then the approximation ( [ eq : numdiff1 ] ) is accurate to within @xmath106 .",
    "numerical tests suggested @xmath107 is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 is typically around @xmath108 .",
    "also , varying the choice of @xmath109 in ( [ eq : numdiff1 ] ) suggested the approximation is accurate to about 4 decimal digits with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    in principle , our computations of @xmath55 can be made completely rigorous by carrying them out in sufficient precision .",
    "if one plans on calculating @xmath55 with very high precision , however , it will likely be better to first derive a riemann - siegel type formula for @xmath112 itself , with explicit estimates for the remainder .",
    "such a formula will be useful on its own as it can be be used to check other conjectures about @xmath113 .",
    "numerical data from high zeros of the zeta function generally agrees well with the asymptotic results that have been proved , as well as with several conjectures .",
    "there are some systematic differences between observed and expected distributions , but the discrepancies decline with growing heights .",
    "the results of this paper provide additional evidence for the speed of convergence of the zeta function to its asymptotic limits .",
    "they also demonstrate the importance of outliers , and thus the need to collect extensive data in order to obtain valid statistical results .",
    "the long - range correlations that have been found among values of the derivative of the zeta function at zeros can be explained by known analytic techniques ."
