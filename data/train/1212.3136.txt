    "in black hole physics , there are mainly two ways to calculate the hawking temperature .",
    "one is to use the quantum field theory in the curved space - time background , while the other is to use the euclidean analytic continuation .",
    "similar to this , in cosmology , we also have two ways to include quantum fluctuations : one is to use the quantum field theory in the de sitter background and this method is extended to the stochastic approach , while the other is the euclidean quantum cosmology by using the mini - superspace and instantons .    in this presentation , we aim to compare two approaches for a simple case . here , we use a simple einstein gravity with a scalar field @xmath0 @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we consider a quadratic potential , @xmath2 with @xmath3 limit .",
    "we define the hubble parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we can choose @xmath5 without loss of generality up to the parameter redefinition .",
    "we summarize the discussion of the author s recent paper @xcite , comment their physical meanings , and discuss possible future applications .",
    "first , we briefly summarize the recent development in euclidean quantum cosmology . in this area",
    ", people find a solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "especially , it is known that the euclidean path integral can be regarded as the ground state of the wave function of the universe : @xmath6 = \\int_{h , \\chi } \\mathcal{d}g\\mathcal{d}\\phi \\;\\ ; e^{-s_{\\mathrm{e}}[g,\\phi]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined on a certain boundary of a compact euclidean manifold . here , we consider the euclidean action @xmath9 this path - integral is to sum over all non - singular geometries with a single boundary .    for the cosmological purposes , we assume the following metric : @xmath10 this is the _ mini - superspace approximation_.    furthermore , using the _ steepest - descent approximation _ , we can regard that the euclidean path integral can be approximated by the sum - over on - shell solutions ( instantons ) that satisfy the following equations of motion : @xmath11 where the upper sign is for the euclidean time and the lower sign is for the lorentzian time .",
    "initially , the equations should satisfy @xmath12 for the regularity of equations .",
    "we think that a history initially begins from a euclidean time and eventually approaches a lorentzian time . between two limits ,",
    "a complex time path connects the initial point and the final point .",
    "this path should satisfy the analyticity of complex analysis .",
    "hence , all functions should be complexified in general , although all functions should be realized after a long lorentzian time .",
    "this complexified solutions was named by _",
    "fuzzy instantons _ @xcite .",
    "fuzzy instantons should become real - valued functions and this condition is named by _",
    "classicality_. finally , the on - shell euclidean action becomes @xmath13 and the probability becomes @xmath14 .",
    "if we only restrict real - valued instantons , then only @xmath15 can be a solution , so - called the hawking - moss instanton @xcite .",
    "however , if we extend to fuzzy instantons with classicality , then we can find a solution even for @xmath16 cases .",
    "then , all the solutions are necessarily dynamic .",
    "we need numerical techniques to find the classicalized complexified instantons .    after we find numerical solutions , our purpose is to study the probability distribution .",
    "we can try to add the correction term to the action as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 during the lorentzian time .",
    "the first term is the well - known hawking - moss instanton term .",
    "the second term is the correction term due to the dynamics of the scalar field .",
    "therefore , the second term is the _ contribution of fuzzy instantons_. here , @xmath19 is independent of @xmath20 for a given history , and hence , @xmath21 should have a dependence on @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 is not a dynamical time variable ; but this corresponds a slice choice in the mini - superspace",
    ". we will call this the observing time .    from the numerical observations ,",
    "the euclidean action is approximately @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the field observed at the _ turning point _ from the euclidean time to the lorentzian time .",
    "this was confirmed in @xcite . using this",
    ", one can discuss by a formal way .",
    "note that we can use the equations of motion in the slow - roll limit : @xmath24 at the observing time @xmath25 , the potential varies : @xmath26 and hence , the euclidean action can be expanded by @xmath27 therefore , we obtain @xmath28 .",
    "second , to discuss the quantum field theory in a de sitter background , we first introduce a de sitter metric : @xmath29 . here , we emphasize that the space topology is flat , while the topology was compact in the euclidean case ( even after the wick rotation ) .",
    "therefore , two pictures are completely different at a first glance ; while , this difference will give us an important intuition later . here , @xmath30 is dimensionless , while @xmath31 has a length dimension .    by introducing the conformal time @xmath32 and defining a scalar field as @xmath33",
    ", one can change the equation of motion for @xmath34 : @xmath35 where a prime is the derivative with respect to @xmath36 . in a de sitter space , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this equation has the general solution @xmath39 e^{i \\textbf{k } \\cdot \\textbf{x}},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 satisfies @xmath41 since the solution of equation  ( [ eq : varphi_eta ] ) should have a proper boundary condition in the sub - horizon limit , the solution is expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 note that if @xmath44 becomes imaginary , then the short wavelength modes can not be regarded small and hence they can not be regarded classical .",
    "however , if @xmath44 is real , then we can think that short wavelength modes contribute the long wavelength modes ( locally homogeneous modes ) as a quantum fluctuation .",
    "now we calculate the dispersion of @xmath0 : @xmath45 this integral in itself has a divergence as @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we need to introduce the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath47 . this is consistent with our stochastic approach ; we consider only the super - horizon fourier modes so that @xmath48",
    ". then , the momentum cutoff @xmath49 or physical momentum cutoff @xmath50 corresponds the smoothing length scale ( minimal length of relevant waves ) @xmath51 that determines how to coarse - grain the momentum space .",
    "now , the integration can be expanded as follows : @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we can represent @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a certain constant that we can choose freely .",
    "we can approximate the euclidean probability as @xmath58 where this approximation is sufficiently good for the small field limit around the local minimum .",
    "then the dispersion of the field in the euclidean approach becomes @xmath59 by comparing with the stochastic picture , we conclude that @xmath60 and @xmath61 or @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the physical cutoff scale of the momentum space . in the stochastic approach ,",
    "if a certain quantum fluctuation that has a shorter wave length than @xmath64 , then we can ignore ; the universe is homogeneous up to the length scale @xmath65 . on the other hand , in the euclidean approach ,",
    "the instanton is homogeneous up to the size of the universe @xmath66 .",
    "now what we can say is that @xmath67 this is conceptually discussed in figure  [ fig : interpretation ] .",
    "this has two important physical meanings : ( 1 ) the cutoff is naturally introduced by euclidean instantons and ( 2 ) it is due to _ complex - valued _ instantons .",
    "therefore , this strongly supports that complex - valued ( fuzzy ) instantons are indeed physical .",
    "there were progresses in euclidean quantum gravity and euclidean quantum cosmology .",
    "we summarize as follows :    1 .",
    "hartle , hawking and hertog @xcite discussed that a classical universe requires inflation . however , the euclidean probability prefers smaller e - foldings .",
    "hwang , sahlmann and yeom @xcite and hwang , lee , sahlmann and yeom @xcite discussed that complex - valued instantons are useful to explain the initial condition for the stabilization of dilaton or moduli fields .",
    "3 .   in hwang ,",
    "lee , sahlmann and yeom @xcite , they commented that the no - boundary wave function perhaps prefers anti de sitter vacuum .",
    "hwang , kim , lee , sahlmann and yeom @xcite discussed that a large number of fields can help to explain the preference of sufficient e - foldings .",
    "hwang , lee , stewart , yeom and zoe @xcite discussed that the complex - valued ( fuzzy ) instantons are indeed physical by comparing with the stochastic approach .",
    "the origin of the cutoff in the stochastic approach can be understood from the euclidean approach .      1 .",
    "it is not entirely clear whether the no - boundary wave function is relevant to explain the realistic inflation model , that may come from particle physics or string theory .",
    "this may be connected the viability of inflationary models ; also , may be connected to observational consequences . 2 .",
    "it is not entirely clear how to extend to less symmetric case , for example , spherically symmetric case .",
    "this may help us to understand black hole thermodynamics .",
    "3 .   for large mass cases",
    ", there appears a field space such that there is no classicalized universe .",
    "what are their meaning , especially in the multiverse ?",
    "if we think that the multiverse is a statistical realization of the wave function , then we may say something about the unclassical histories of the euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "this may be related to the inhomogeneity of the universe .",
    "the comparison between euclidean quantum cosmology and loop quantum cosmology can be interesting .",
    "in addition , the extension to the spherically symmetric fuzzy instantons can be a challenging issue that may be related to black hole physics .",
    "the connection / comparison between the decoherence and the classicality of the instantons - classicalization _ without _ ( ? ) decoherence - will be useful to understand the fundamental nature of the universe and multiverse",
