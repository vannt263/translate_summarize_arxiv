    "* in this supplemental material we discuss the preparation of our fermionic quantum gas ( s1 ) , the detection after tof and _ in situ _ ( s2 ) and the data analysis ( s3 ) . the theoretical model is introduced in ( s4 ) and the linearized calculation is presented in ( s5 ) . for the tensor expansion in the @xmath0 system see ( s6 ) . *",
    "we sympathetically cool about @xmath76 spin - polarized @xmath14k atoms in the state @xmath15 and @xmath77 to @xmath78 using @xmath2rb in a magnetic trap .",
    "afterwards we transfer the atoms to a crossed circular - elliptical optical dipole trap with @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80 radii are @xmath81 for the circular beam and @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the elliptical beam , where the tight focus is in the vertical direction . using rf - pulses and rf - sweeps , an equal mixture of the two hyperfine states @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "is prepared and evaporatively cooled in the trap by a @xmath86 exponential intensity ramp .",
    "the final trapping frequencies are typically @xmath87 with @xmath88 particles at temperatures of @xmath89 .",
    "to obtain the experimental data , we used two different detection protocols , which have complementary advantages . in most of the experiments , we applied time of flight imaging , where we switch off all optical potentials , and perform a stern - gerlach separation of the different spin states within the free expansion time of @xmath90 .",
    "the atoms are detected via resonant absorption imaging and the center - of - mass is calculated for each of the separated clouds individually .",
    "this method has the advantage that all spin - components can be detected simultaneously , but the disadvantage that all spatial modes but the dipole mode are effectively washed out , since the tof mixes momentum and spatial components of these modes .    to obtain more information on the spatial modes of the excited spin - waves we employed an _ in situ _ detection protocol , allowing us to observe , e.g. , the breathing dynamics in fig .",
    "2(b ) . instead of separating the different spins by a stern - gerlach procedure in tof , we use microwave pulses at @xmath91 , to transfer all but one single component to the @xmath92 manifold of @xmath14k , which is off - resonant to the detection light , and",
    "consequently the transferred atoms do not appear in the absorption images .",
    "afterwards we switch off all magnetic fields and optical potentials for @xmath93 to detect the atomic sample .",
    "to record the time evolution of all four components , it is therefore necessary to repeat the full measurement four times .",
    "for every time step of the spin - wave dynamics , we determine the center - of - mass of each of the spin components .",
    "we extract the oscillation frequencies @xmath94 by fitting an exponentially damped cosine of the form @xmath95 with oscillation amplitude @xmath96 , damping rate @xmath97 , a phase shift @xmath98 and a constant offset @xmath99 . for the dipole and octupole fraction in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we use a slightly different method .",
    "we take the spatial average of the absolute value of the projected multipoles @xmath100 for each time step as @xmath101 where @xmath66 is the pixel index of the image and @xmath102 is the number of pixels . by this procedure ,",
    "the sign - information of the projection are lost and therefore , we fit the resulting time series by @xmath103 and report the amplitude @xmath96 .",
    "we describe the multi - component fermionic system using the single - particle wigner - function , with its time evolution given by the semiclassical kinetic equation @xmath104\\nonumber\\\\+\\frac12\\left\\lbrace \\partial_pw(z , p),\\partial_zv(z)\\right\\rbrace   \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the short notation @xmath105 for the single - particle part of motion .",
    "we do not explicitly include the magnetic field gradient , since it is used for the creation of the spin - wave but not necessary for its propagation once created .",
    "the derivation of this equation is outlined in previous works @xcite .",
    "one basically starts from the full mean - field dynamics of the wigner function and applies a semiclassical approximation by neglecting terms involving higher order derivatives with respect to position and momentum . to leading ( zeroth ) order ,",
    "the mean - field interaction gives rise to the commutator and the next ( first ) order is given by the anticommutator .",
    "we have neglected here even higher orders terms .",
    "the important term here is the commutator which is absent in the spinless case and describes interaction driven coherent spin dynamics .",
    "it is also dominant with respect to the anticommutator and we neglect the latter in our analytical studies ( while we keep it in the numerical simulations ) .",
    "the kinetic equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is nonlinear , since the mean - field potential depends on the wigner - function itself and its matrix elements are defined as @xmath106 with the coupling constants defined as @xmath107 for arbitrary spin @xmath108 with the corresponding clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath109 . here",
    "@xmath110 denotes the interaction strength for the scattering of two particles with total spin @xmath111 . for a real spin-3/2 system there",
    "are only scattering channels for @xmath112 , but in the numerical simulations of ( [ eq:1 ] ) we take into account the values of @xmath113 for spin 9/2 in the sub - manifold of @xmath114 , which also depend on @xmath115 @xcite . since in the experiment spin - waves along the @xmath65-axis are created , an effective one - dimensional kinetic equation is sufficient to describe these spin - waves .",
    "this is obtained by integrating out the transversal degrees of freedom from the three - dimensional case .",
    "the coupling constants for the 3d case , @xmath116 with s - wave scattering lengths @xmath117 , are modified by the local transversal density profile as @xmath118 .",
    "this modification depends on @xmath65 but only weakly so we approximate it with the central density @xmath119 .",
    "frequencies for small amplitude spin - waves in the linear regime , such as close to the minimum in fig .",
    "3(a ) , can be obtained by linearizing the kinetic equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) . for this , we consider small changes with respect to the stationary state @xmath120 , namely @xmath121 .",
    "thus we investigate the spin - waves for short times and small amplitudes . the mean field , as a function of density likewise expands as @xmath122 and we substitute both expressions into ( [ eq:1 ] ) without the anti - commutator , to obtain the linearized kinetic equation @xmath123+\\left[w^0,\\delta v,\\right]\\right ) \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our next step to explicitly study different kinds of spin - wave modes is the so called _ moment method _ @xcite .",
    "the thinking behind it is to look at the time evolution of moments of the position and momentum operators .",
    "the @xmath35-th moment of such an operator in the phase - space representation is the expectation value @xmath124 . expanding the kinetic equation in moments means taking into account only different modes of spin - waves up to a certain order ,",
    "e.g. dipole modes for @xmath51 , breathing dynamics for @xmath53 and further .",
    "first we need to find a suitable expression for the stationary state @xmath125 , the state of the system before a spin - wave is excited by applying a gradient . with the preparation scheme in mind ,",
    "considering the preparation pulse to be infinitely short in time , we approximate @xmath126 as a product of spin and orbital degrees of freedom @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a matrix in spin space determined by the preparation pulses and @xmath129 is the phase - space distribution for a two - component fermi gas onto which the pulse is applied .",
    "this distribution is given for a non - interacting gas in a harmonic trap in local - density approximation as @xmath130 . in principle , corrections to this distribution arise due to interactions but in our case the mean - field energy is small compared to kinetic and potential energy and we neglect them .",
    "the mean field @xmath131 then depends on the density distribution @xmath132 , and we introduce the short notation @xmath133 . for the frequencies of the dipole modes we expand @xmath134 and @xmath135 into moments of position and momentum up to first order only @xmath136 we take the zeroth and first moments of @xmath137 of @xmath134 in ( [ eq:4 ] ) and obtain their relationship to @xmath138 @xmath139 with particle number @xmath140 , as well as @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we substitute expressions ( [ eq:6 ] ) into the linearized equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) , then take again the zeroth and first moments of @xmath137 to obtain three equations for the matrices @xmath143 respectively @xmath144+\\left[a,\\tilde m\\right]\\right)\\,,\\\\ \\label{eq:8 } \\partial_t b - m\\omega_z^2 c=&\\frac{i_1}{i\\hbar}\\left(\\left[m,\\tilde b\\right]+\\left[b,\\tilde m\\right]\\right)\\,,\\\\ \\label{eq:9 } \\partial_t c+\\frac1 m b=&\\frac{i_2}{i\\hbar}\\left[c,\\tilde m\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the first equation is decoupled from the others and does not lead to spatial dynamics , so we discard it . equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) describe dipole oscillations of all spin components of the wigner function and the frequencies can be obtained by a fourier transform @xmath148 and solving the eigenvalue equations , similar to the procedure for a spin 1 bose gas in refs .",
    "@xcite .      for the sake of simplicity",
    "we now demonstrate this for the special case of su(n)-symmetry ( @xmath149 ) assuming all scattering lengths to be equal . for the @xmath150 subsystem of @xmath14k considered in the experiments ,",
    "our numerical comparison shows only small differences in the spin - wave behavior between this case and the true scattering parameters . in the su(4)-symmetric case with",

    "the methods described thus far in this supplemental material are valid for any value of the spin .",
    "we now focus on the @xmath0 case in order to demonstrate the decoupling of the spin - nematic component . in previous studies of the @xmath1 case @xcite the kinetic equation and wigner - function",
    "were rewritten in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath160 which form a complete basis for hermitian @xmath161-matrices and allow to identify the vector - part of the mean field as an effective magnetic field .",

    "<S> , the smft allows to intuitively explain the novel emerging spin - wave characteristics in a high - spin system . </S>",
    "<S> we find a linear decoupling of the spin - nematic component , which in turn allowed us to directly observe nonlinear mode - coupling in the spin - wave dynamics . finally , we demonstrated how to control the multipole character of spin waves which leads to a reversal of the resulting counterflow spin current of two spin components . </S>",
    "<S> our results constitute the first experimental investigation of coherent many - body dynamics of a high - spin fermionic quantum gas . </S>",
