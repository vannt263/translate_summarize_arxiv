    "one of the many novel optical phenomena exhibited by photonic lattices is the modification of spontaneous emission properties .",
    "@xcite a photonic lattice can funnel radiation into narrow energy bands , where exceedingly high intensities at photonic lattice bandedges have been predicted theoretically and observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite a question is whether the peak intensities exceed those of a blackbody under similar experimental conditions .",
    "@xcite the answer is important for scientific understanding and can impact the development of new light sources .",
    "it is generally agreed that the higher photonic - lattice density of states will increase intracavity intensity .",
    "the debate concerns the output intensity in comparison with that of a blackbody . arriving at an answer",
    "is difficult experimentally because it is difficult to ensure that the comparison is made under similar conditions .",
    "theoretically , the difficulty lies with the treatment of the matter and optical aspects of the problem .",
    "@xcite the derivation of the matter equations requires knowledge of the normal modes of the optical structure , preferably in the form of an orthonormal basis .",
    "however , such a basis set is not rigorously defined for a finite photonic lattice with outcoupling loss .",
    "this problem occurs also in laser theory , where one usually begins with the fox - li modes for a fabry - perot cavity with perfectly reflecting mirrors , and introduces a loss mechanism to represent the outcoupling .",
    "@xcite such a phenomenological approach is inadequate for the present problem because of the inconsistency arising from separating the treatments of the eigenmode problem and the outcoupling effects .",
    "the approach taken in this paper  considers the photonic lattice and free space outside of the photonic lattice as one combined system ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we follow the method of an earlier paper on the linewidth of a fabry - periot laser @xcite in representing free space by a very large cavity .",
    "the photonic lattice is approximated by a series of semitransparent interfaces .",
    "we begin with discussing the one - dimensional geometry , @xcite which we will show to contain the essential features necessary for addressing our question .",
    "section ii discusses the equations and boundary conditions obeyed by the modes of our universe. the determination of the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions requires the simultaneous diagonalization of a usually large matrix and the solution of a transcendental equation .",
    "a numerical procedure for a photonic lattice of arbitrary size and interface transmission is presented in appendix a.    in sec .",
    "iii , the radiation field is expanded in term of these large number of modes and quantized .",
    "the radiation source is also treated quantum mechanically , as an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of two - level atoms confined within the photonic lattice structure .",
    "the equations of motion for the photon number and atomic populations are derived in this section .",
    "we choose a fully quantized ( i.e. , quantized matter and field ) treatment based on einstein s derivation of the planck radiation law , which showed the importance of a consistent treatment of stimulated and spontaneous emission processes .",
    "@xcite einstein was able to circumvent a fully quantized theory by using wien displacement law , which applied only to emission in free space .",
    "for the photonic lattice , such a general relation does not exist .",
    "there are several recent calculations of photonic - lattice emission where the emitting source is a classically described current .",
    "@xcite an advantage of our treatment over these classical ones is that by paralleling the planck radiation law derivation , our comparison of photonic - lattice and blackbody emission spectra is appreciably more straightforward .",
    "moreover , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite which is an essential assumption in the classical calculations , @xcite appears as a result in a fully quantized treatment because spontaneous emission is treated from first principles .",
    "section iv describes a spectrometer model used to determine the emission spectrum .",

    "section vi summarizes the extension to a 3-dimensional geometry .",
    "the comparison between photonic lattice and blackbody spectra is made assuming a spherically symmetric photonic - lattice dielectric function .",
    "the 3-d treatment is important for three reasons .",
    "first , it proves that the theory can retrieve planck s blackbody distribution in the absence of a photonic lattice .",
    "second , it verifies the 1-d treatment in terms of containing the necessary physics for answering the question of photonic lattice versus blackbody thermal emission .",
    "lastly , it points out the substantial increase in numerical demands with increase dimensionality , thus justifying our concentration on the 1-d analysis to facilitate physical understanding and tractability of numerics .",
    "in this section , the eigenmodes for a photonic lattice coupled to the outside world are derived using the model depicted in fig .",

    "most of the solutions are not resonant with the photonic lattice , so that mode amplitude is negligible inside the photonic lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "figures 2 ( b ) and 2 ( c ) show examples of photonic lattice modes , where the latter figure clearly depicts the first derivative discontinuities at the interfaces .",
    "we show in figs . 3 and 4 that the model can reproduce the photonic - lattice properties relevant to our study .",

    "approximates the free - space situation .",
    "figure 4 shows that the model can also reproduce the significant flattening of the photonic - lattice dispersion at the bandedges .",
    "plotted in the figure is the dispersion for a twelve period ( @xmath29 ) photonic lattice , where the points indicate the actual eigenfrequencies and the solid curve is a fit of the data to illustrate the case of @xmath30 .  the flattening of the dispersion at a bandedge results in a drastic increase in the density of states .",
    "we define the density of states as @xmath31 , where following solid state convention @xmath32 is the wavevector with vanishing interface reflectivity .",
    "the effects of the large density of states increase on intensity inside and outside of a photonic lattice is the focus of this paper .",
    "to study the modification of emission characteristics by a photonic lattice , we consider the situation of an ensemble of two - level atoms located inside a photonic lattice .",

    "is a photonic bandgap where emission is strongly suppressed . by repeating the calculation with @xmath99 , we obtain the corresponding blackbody spectrum ( dashed curve ) .",

    "in contrast to inside the photonic lattice , where there is significant optical intensity enhancement , fig .",
    "7 indicates that the intracavity emission peaks are appreciably depressed outside the photonic lattice .",
    "the strong intracavity enhancement by the photonic - lattice density of states appears to be cancelled by an outcoupling attenuation .",
    "this leaves the photonic lattice emission peaks to be essentially independent of interface transmission .",
    "more importantly , these peaks lie at or slightly below the blackbody emission curve .    simulations performed over a wide range of input parameters point towards the result that as long as the active - medium populations @xmath61 and @xmath62 are in thermal equilibrium , the photonic - lattice output is always below that of the blackbody . for instance , the spectra are insensitive to the choice of @xmath51 .",
    "the blackbody spectrum is also insensitive to @xmath80 because of the weak frequency dependence of the blackbody photon density .",

    "too small a @xmath80 introduces noise in the spectrum because of the inadequate resolution of the system normal modes ( i.e. because @xmath28 is insufficiently large ) .      to study active photonic - lattice operation in greater generality , we allow the active medium populations to deviate from thermal equilibrium",
    ". the investigation is performed by repeating the earlier calculations , keeping all input parameters except @xmath60 the same .",

    ". 8 ( a ) shows a noticeable deformation of the photonic - lattice excited - state population distribution .",
    "there is also a significant difference between @xmath62 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 ( dot - dashed curve ) , which are the actual distribution and the asymptotic ( @xmath106 ) equilibrium distribution , respectively .",
    "further reduction to @xmath107 significantly increases the deviation of the photonic - lattice excited - state population distribution from a maxwell boltzmann distribution [ see solid curve , fig 8 ( b ) ] .",
    "holes are burned in the distribution because the population relaxation is insufficiently fast to replenish the excited - state population depleted by the spectrally relatively narrow radiation field emitted by photonic lattice .",
    "there is also a change in the blackbody distribution [ dashed curve , fig .",
    "8(b ) ] , to one that approximates a maxwell boltzmann distribution at @xmath108 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "since the active media in both structures are identical , the difference between the photonic - lattice and blackbody populations ( solid and dashed curves , respectively ) is from photonic - lattice effects .",
    "the effects of the population changes in fig .",
    "8 on the emission spectra are depicted in fig 9 .",
    "plotted on the y - axis is the relative emission intensity inside ( outside ) the photonic lattice , which we define as @xmath109 for the photonic lattice divided by @xmath110 for the blackbody . in spite of the large increase in excited state population",
    ", we find that the intracavity and output relative intensities remain basically unchanged when @xmath60 is reduced from @xmath103 to @xmath102 .",
    "in particular , the output photonic - lattice intensity remains at or slightly below that of the blackbody ( i.e. , relative intensity @xmath111 ) .",
    "however , the result changes considerably for @xmath107 . here , the intensity within the photonic - lattice band increases considerably relative to that of the blackbody both inside and outside the cavity ( solid curves ) .",
    "more importantly , the solid curve in fig . 9 ( b ) clearly shows greater output intensity for the photonic lattice than the blackbody throughout the emission band of the photonic lattice .",
    "this enhancement of output emission occurs for identically pumped active regions and is a result of a nonequilibrium population that shows significant hole burning .",
    "the presence of nonequilibrium effects may be the cause for experimental observations of metallic photonic - lattice emission exceeding that of the blackbody .",
    "@xcite note that the difference in output emission spectra [ solid and dashed curves in fig . 9 ( b ) ] comes from population distributions that are , on the average , quite similar .",
    "that is , a least - squares fit of the solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "8 ( b ) will produce maxwell - boltzmann s distributions that differ in temperature by less than 20k .",
    "therefore , measurement of average temperature will not identify the experimental conditions leading to the photonic - lattice output emission exceeding that of the blackbody .",
    "rather , an energy - resolved measurement of the emitter upper state population is necessary .",
    "the end results reached in our analyses involving equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations are robust , i.e. , they are relatively insensitive to the choice of input parameters . while calculations performed with different interface transmission show significant differences in spectral shapes and intracavity intensities , the output intensities remain relatively constant because of the mitigating influence of the coupling to free space .",
    "calculations are also performed for different number of photonic - lattice periods .",
    "the results show negligible differences beyond @xmath112 , thus verifying that the use of a 12-period photonic lattice does not lead to loss of generality . clearly noticeable",
    "are effects , such as differences in excess output intensity with varying interface transmission , that are due to optical nonlinearities in the nonequilibrium active medium .",

    "however , for slow population relaxation , there is a greater tendency for a nonequilibrium photonic - lattice population .",
