    "the kaon b parameter , @xmath0 , is an essential bridge between @xmath8 mixing experiments and the ckm matrix . using domain wall fermions ( dwf ) ,",
    "quenched calculations of @xmath0 have been done @xcite , where operator mixing and @xmath9 errors are small because of the good chiral properties of dwf . including dynamical fermions",
    "is an obvious way to improve these calculations .    using an improved hmc algorithm for dwf @xcite , we have generated three ensembles of lattices of size @xmath10 for @xmath11 qcd with degenerate dynamical masses of @xmath12 .",
    "our fermion action is the standard dwf action with @xmath13 and @xmath14 and our gauge action is dbw2 with @xmath15 .",
    "extrapolating the rho mass in @xmath16 to the chiral limit , we find a lattice spacing of @xmath4 and a residual mass @xmath17 .",
    "we measure on lattices separated by 50 trajectories and have 78 , 84 , 57 lattices for @xmath18 , 0.03 and 0.04 , respectively . for more details see @xcite and for results with @xmath19 matrix elements see @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 four - quark operator @xmath24 . for a general value of the mass of the pseudoscalars entering ( [ eq : bk_def ] )",
    ", we will use the symbol @xmath25 , reserving @xmath0 for the case where the pseudoscalars have the kaon mass .",
    "we first evaluate this by the conventional method , where the ratio of a three - point green s function and two pseudoscalar  axial - vector correlators is taken : @xmath26 ( no sum on @xmath27 ) .",
    "we use coulomb gauge fixed wall sources at @xmath28 and @xmath29 for valence masses , @xmath30 , equal to @xmath31 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 and 0.05 .",
    "propagators are found with both periodic and anti - periodic temporal boundary conditions and averaged to double the temporal length .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bk_conv_plateau ] we show @xmath32 .",
    "we choose to fit data from @xmath33 to 17 , same fitting range as @xcite , to determine @xmath34 .",
    "the error bars in this figure , and throughout this report , assume that our lattices are decorrelated .",
    "the fits shown in figure [ fig : bk_conv_plateau ] give values of @xmath35 , 0.611(6 ) and 0.645(7 ) for @xmath36 , 0.03 and 0.04 respectively .",
    "variations in the plateaus are noticeable at the 1 - 2% level and the assumption of 50 trajectories being sufficient for decorrelation needs further studies and statistics .",
    "however , the current data certainly makes a few percent resolution in the lattice values achievable by possibly doubling the statistics .     for @xmath37 , 0.03 and 0.04 .",
    "the lines are the average from @xmath33 to 17 . ]    in figure [ fig : bk_conv_vs_mass ] , we show our results for @xmath34 for degenerate valence quark masses for each different value of @xmath16 .",
    "the filled points in the figure have @xmath38 and correspond to the fitted lines in figure [ fig : bk_conv_plateau ] .",
    "( we also have data for non - degenerate valence quarks and with our statistics , only the average quark mass plays a role . )",
    "our simplest result to report for @xmath0 comes from extrapolating the @xmath39 points in figure [ fig : bk_conv_vs_mass ] to @xmath40 .",
    "( a pseudoscalar with two quarks with @xmath41 has the mass of the kaon . )",
    "we perform this extrapolation using the partially quenched formula @xcite @xmath42 fitting the three points with @xmath39 to determine @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we find @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( statistical error only ) , with a small @xmath48/d.o.f .",
    "note that we are using the known coefficient of the chiral logarithm , @xmath49 and @xmath50 gev .",
    "the statistical error in the lattice spacing gives an additional 2% systematic error in the value of @xmath51 , due to the uncertainty in the strange quark mass .",
    "while our data makes extrapolation to @xmath41 quite robust , the value of @xmath43 is much less solid .",
    "a small value in the chiral limit has also been seen in the quenched calculations , but more control over the extrapolation is needed .",
    "we have also fit the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath30 to ( [ eq : chpt ] ) for each fixed @xmath16 , using the five values for @xmath30 .",
    "the interpolated values for @xmath52 are 0.537(11 ) , 0.557(9 ) and 0.568(10 ) for @xmath18 , 0.03 and 0.04 respectively .",
    "we reduce the fitting range to exclude the heaviest two points and see the results stay same within error .     for different valence and dynamical masses .",
    "the filled symbols have @xmath39 . ]",
    "an alternative method of extracting @xmath0 is to divide the three - point function in the numerator of ( [ eq : bk_def ] ) by a wall - wall pseudoscalar correlator @xcite .",
    "this removes some zero mode effects in the quenched approximation , while giving larger statistical errors .",
    "however here we see no difference in the central values for results calculated using these two methods .",
    "to get to @xmath53 we need to renormalize @xmath51 and control mixing with other dimension six , chirally disallowed operators . using npr @xcite in the quenched theory",
    "we have seen that mixing coefficients with chirally disallowed operators are small .",
    "preliminary npr calculations on our @xmath54 dynamical dwf lattices also show that the mixing coefficients are small ( less than a few percent ) .",
    "these npr results are preliminary , since we have not fully investigated all the mass dependence of the procedure and our statistics are somewhat limited",
    ". however , we can also use the @xmath55 parameter introduced in @xcite to quantify the chiral symmetry breaking of dwf and conclude that the mixing with chirally disallowed operators is of @xmath56 and hence negligible .",
    "we calculate @xmath57 , the renormalization group invariant ( rgi ) parameter , from @xmath51 via the multiplicative renormalization @xmath58 a similar equation is used for @xmath53 except that @xmath59 .",
    "the factor @xmath60 is calculated following the techniques in @xcite with all quark masses equal to @xmath16 .",
    "this quantity is extrapolated to @xmath61 then the extrapolation to @xmath62 is done to remove @xmath63 errors . the two loop @xmath64 formula with @xmath65 mev and @xmath66",
    "is used . the uncertainty due to the choice of @xmath67",
    "is estimated by changing @xmath67 by @xmath6850 mev .",
    "we check the results stay same within error by changing the order of the two limits , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    following the procedure above , we find @xmath71 and @xmath72 at @xmath73 gev .",
    "these numbers agree with the one loop perturbative calculation , which gives the @xmath74 factor to be 0.92@xcite .",
    "our initial calculation of @xmath0 with dynamical domain wall fermions has yielded @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the errors on these quantities include the statistical error on @xmath51 , the error on the @xmath77 factors and a 2% error reflecting the uncertainty in the kaon mass arising from the uncertainty in the lattice scale .",
    "these results correspond to an extrapolation of @xmath6 to @xmath78 .",
    "we summarize results for each dynamical lattice in table [ tab : b_k ] .",
    "these are obtained by interpolating @xmath30 to @xmath78 at fixed @xmath16 and are somewhat smaller than quenched dwf calculations at a similar lattice spacing .",
    "we see a trend in table [ tab : b_k ] toward lower values as the dynamical quark mass is reduced .",
    "we have likely underestimated our statistical error , due to the long autocorrelation times in dynamical qcd simulations , and we have not yet studied the other methods of chiral extrapolations , the continuum limit or finite volume effects . however , it is clear that these dynamical dwf calculations are possible with current computers and hold promise for the next generation of computers .",
