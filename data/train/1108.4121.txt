    "two related questions define a fundamental role for statistical physics in systems biology : ( 1 ) .  how do biomolecular systems achieve reliable `` device - level '' behavior when they consist of highly stochastic componentry  @xcite , in particular molecular complexes held together by low - energy hydrogen or van der waals bonds ? ( 2 ) .",
    "are such systems structured in a modular fashion  @xcite , _ i.e. _ can complex molecular networks decompose into quasi - autonomous functional units performing identifiable tasks which are robust against many physical parameter changes and are recombinable in evolution ?",
    "the device logic of biomolecular systems employs many of the same abstractions as electronic engineering  @xcite , including amplification , filtering , and switching . switches ( which use elements of amplification and filtering ) are used wherever a discrete sequence of events is required , enabling committed threshold response to environmental cues during development  @xcite , establishing `` checkpoints '' for intermediate states , in processes like cell division that require strict sequencing of events  @xcite , or programming the complex progressions of cell - type differentiation  @xcite .",
    "two classes of biomolecular processes in which modular switching is widely recognized are gene expression and signal transduction . in gene expression , the switch states are associated with patterns of genes activated for protein production , and a stochastic component is introduced in the system by the small number of weakly - bound transcription factors  @xcite . in signal transduction ,",
    "the states of the switch are frequently determined by the number of phosphate or methyl groups covalently attached to specific target amino acid residues on one or more dedicated proteins  @xcite .",
    "stochasticity in this system can again be caused by the small number of proteins or the complexes these proteins form with the catalysts which promote attachment or detachment of the phosphate or methyl groups .",
    "gene expression changes cell type on slower timescales ( minutes to hours ) than signal transduction ( seconds ) , but since many cell - type changes occur in response to external signals  @xcite , or rely on amplification and stabilization of internal signals  @xcite , switching behavior is often produced by both systems acting together .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problems of mechanism for the emergence of robust switching in stochastic molecular systems , and of quantitative estimation of the noise and stability properties of switches .",
    "we consider switching in signal transduction via the mechanism of phosphorylation ( addition of phosphate groups via the action of a kinase ) and dephosphorylation ( removal of phosphate groups by the action of a phosphatase ) since these are a common motif found in most if not all signalling networks .",
    "in addition , the relative simplicity of phosphorylation transitions lends itself to the abstraction of many real transduction cascades in terms of a few processes , allowing us to isolate the problems of formation , control , and robustness of the switch .",
    "we observe that the most fundamental unit in signal - transduction cascades is a single type of target protein with multiple phosphorylation states ( called phosphoepitopes ) , among which transitions are naturally modeled as a reaction - diffusion process .",
    "the network properties necessary for switching , which may be distributed in real systems among several proteins in a signal - transduction cascade , or between the cascade and the genetic transcription factors for the target proteins , are readily lumped together and assigned to a single species to produce minimal models .",
    "this coarse - graining reduces network complexity while still keeping its essential regulatory features .",
    "we are able to write down exact master equations for such ideal models , and to solve them systematically with field - theoretic methods from reaction - diffusion theory .",
    "switching in biomolecular systems , at the least , refers to sigmoidal response to input signals , termed `` ultrasensitivity ''  @xcite .",
    "such response implies a sharp sigmoidal but continuous response in the concentration of a molecule over a narrow range of a ( stationary ) signal . in contrast , _ bistability _ @xcite is a form of switching made possible when two stable states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , co - exist over a signal range . as a consequence , bistable systems exhibit two distinct thresholds as the signal",
    "is varied , one at which a transition occurs from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and another at which the system switches back from @xmath1 to @xmath0 . the separation of thresholds leads to path dependence or hysteresis , and makes a switched state more impervious to stochastic fluctuations of the signal around the transition point , than in the ultrasensitive case .",
    "hysteresis may be obtained by adding positive feedback to sigmoidal response  @xcite .",
    "weak hysteresis may be used to stabilize input signals , equivalent to signal `` debouncing '' in engineering , while strong hysteresis leads to bistability , toggling , and long - term memory  @xcite .",
    "we will look specifically at toggling , because this subsumes all the other phenomena of interest .",
    "the molecular mechanisms used repeatedly in signal transduction for amplification , threshold sensitivity , and switching , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ultrasens ] , as they are instantiated in the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) family of transduction cascades . this widely duplicated and diversified homologue family is used througout the eukaryote kingdom  @xcite , mostly to regulate gene expression in response to cell - membrane received signals .",
    "mapk cascades employ three proteins , each with an unphosphorylated state , and respectively one , two , and two phosphorylated states .",
    "phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of each protein is catalyzed by exogenous kinases and phosphatases , and in addition the fully - phosphorylated states of the first two proteins act as kinases ( phosphorylation catalysts ) on the proteins following them in the cascade .",
    "the cascade is thus an actively driven , dissipative system , maintained away from equilibrium by the supply of activated ( high - energy ) phosphate donors .",
    "when used for switching , mapk cascades may have positive feedback from the output to the highest - level protein , either through gene expression or through inhibition of degradation of the active state  @xcite .     ]",
    "the structure of mapk and other cascades was abstracted by goldbeter and koshland  @xcite to the minimal system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : goldbeter_koshland ] , which they propose as the signaling counterpart to the transistor ( a better analogy would be to the bistable flip - flop , as they use it ) .",
    "a single protein species has a single phosphorylation site .",
    "phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occur via the action of catalysts / enzymes with which the protein can form enzyme - substrate complexes . depending on the rate of these reactions , the steady state fractions of the phosphorylated ( or unphosphorylated ) protein can vary abruptly as a function of these rates .",
    "this analogy has been extended to an elaborate analysis of the properties  @xcite and combinatorial logic  @xcite of such switches .",
    "in particular ,  @xcite considers the case where the the phosphorylated epitope acts as an intermolecular autocatalyst on phosphorylation transitions of any unphosphorylated proteins in the population , and shows that this leads to bistability .",
    "however , autocatalytic feedback only creates a bistable switch if the response of the underlying phosphorylation chain is sigmoidal  @xcite , which in this model requires saturation of the exogenous phosphatase rate via the formation of catalyst - substrate complexes as an intermediate step between the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states of the protein .     and a singly - phosphorylated state @xmath2 .",
    "ref.@xcite chained such couples to model intermolecular phosphorylation , in combination with exogenous catalysts that are often present for both transitions as well .",
    "[ fig : goldbeter_koshland ] ]    we note , however , that kinetic control through saturated complex formation is not the only way to obtain sigmoidal response , because with _ two or more _ phosphorylation sites per protein , the concentration of the fully - phosphorylated state is a sigmoidal function of the ratio of exogenous kinase to phosphatase , even when all catalysts act in the linear proportional regime ( in other words , when catalyst - substrate complexes act to catalyze transitions effectively instantaneously , and are limited only by their frequency of formation through binary encounters ) .",
    "this occurs as long as the catalytic activity is distributive _",
    "i.e. _ , if at most one modification ( phosphorylation or dephosphorylation ) takes place at each enzyme - substrate encounter  @xcite , and ordered ( if successive phosphorylations take place at different residues , an ordered mechanism implies that dephosphorylation takes place in strictly the inverse order )  @xcite .",
    "two of the mapk proteins have this structure , and more significantly , the intermolecular catalysis within the cascade is _ nonspecific _ to phosphorylation reactions on a given protein , though each transition is catalyzed through an independent event  @xcite .",
    "we show below that , combining this form of sigmoidality with positive feedback , it is possible to obtain bistability through a _ non - equilibrium phase transition _ , in which the individual events of catalysis leads to a polarized distribution of phosphorylation states of the target protein .",
    "such population - level cooperative effects , ( proposed also in the context of genetic switches in  @xcite ) , bestow the stability of macroscopic ( thermodynamic ) systems on the otherwise highly stochastic events of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation .",
    "we suggest that the properties of phase - transition - mediated switching are one source of adaptive preference for multiple phosphorylation sites and non - specific catalysis , which one encounters repeatedly ( histidine kinase cascades may have as many as 26 phosphorylation sites  @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies have also shown that multisite phosphorylation with saturation kinetics at each modification step can lead to bistability even in the absence of feedback @xcite .",
    "hence both kinetic control and population - level polarization can lead robustly to bistability in some parameter domains .",
    "however , the two mechanisms are distinguished by their responses to mutations and by their control parameters .",
    "single - molecule control causes switching properties to change if rate kinetics change , in a way that population polarization does not , while the role of nonspecific catalysis in models with population - level cooperative effects ( at least in the form we will consider ) creates a different kind of sensitivity .",
    "an important constraint on the evolutionary innovation , preservation , and diversification of phenotype ( any expressed functionality ) is the shape of its neutral network  @xcite ( the degenerate space in the genotype / phenotype map with regard to that functionality ) .",
    "the phenotype of phase - transition - mediated switching is more nearly controlled by the topology of the catalytic network than by its kinetics , an idea that has been proposed as a source of robustness in the segment - polarity network  @xcite , and theoretically grounded in the case of general enzyme - driven reaction networks in  @xcite .",
    "note that we do not study spatio - temporal correlations induced by diffusion of enzymes and/or enzyme inactivation .",
    "a recent study  @xcite shows that even with the enzymes acting according to a distributive mechanism , rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the substrate molecules can lead to a loss of ultrasenstivity and bistability .",
    "we do not consider the effect of protein degradation either .",
    "our model is however a first theoretical fully stochastic study of the mapk cascade , modelled earlier , to our knowledge , only via rate equations   or stochastic simulations  @xcite .    in this context , we study quantitatively the three critical properties of a phase - transition mediated switch : the conditions for existence of bistability , the noise characteristics of those fluctuations that preserve the domain in the bistable phase , and the large excursions that limit memory or reliability of the switch , and which near the threshold for bistability , can lead to finite - particle number corrections to that threshold .",
    "these have only been considered piecemeal before in other models , with conditions for bistability treated in the infinite - particle ( deterministic ) limit  @xcite , noise from internal and external sources related through ad hoc response functions  @xcite , and stability treated at the level of bounds on scaling , for systems already assumed reduced to one relevant dimension  @xcite .",
    "most biological literature on this subject focuses on phenomenological modeling of ( usually mean - field behavior in ) observed or designed systems  .",
    "we are however more interested in the possibility of statistically motivated universality classification of strategies for switching , which might explain evolutionary regularities in cascades . therefore , in addition to idealizing molecular mechanisms responsible for sigmoidal response and positive feedback as properties of single protein species , to make the polarization - based equivalent of the flip - flop from adding feedback to our fig .",
    "[ fig : goldbeter_koshland ] ( equivalent to fig .  12 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we advisedly exploit symmetry , of either the catalytic topology or the parameters , to make analysis tractable .",
    "this approach also aids in decomposing effects responsible for switching , and relating these to other equilibrium or non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "thus our minimal models deliberately differ from the familiar cascade families in areas not directly related to the production of switching  @xcite .",
    "the model of markevich _ et al _",
    "@xcite is also in this category in demonstrating bistability ( via kinetic control ) at the level of a single stage of the mapk cascade .    the model we propose for a cooperative - phosphorylation switch is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes ] .",
    "each of @xmath3 molecules of a single type of protein has @xmath4 phosphorylation sites indexed @xmath5 , which we suppose for simplicity to be phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in a definite order .",
    "all phosphorylations are catalyzed by exogenous kinases , and all dephosphorylations by exogenous phosphatases . because the enzymes are assumed to operate in the linear regime where complex formation is not rate limiting , the catalytic rate per reaction is proportional to the numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 of kinase and phosphatase particles respectively ( we set the constant of proportionality equal to one by choice of the units of time ) .",
    "the site modifications occur in a specific order , thus sidestepping combinatorial complexity .",
    "furthermore , phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of substrate proteins is assumed to follow a distributive mechanism , whereby a kinase ( phosphatase ) enzyme dissociates from its substrate between subsequent modification events @xcite .",
    "hence the substrate has @xmath8 states .",
    "sites is phosphorylated by a kinase @xmath6 and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase @xmath7 .",
    "the ordered succession of phosphorylations yields @xmath8 modification states , labelled @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) the fully phosphorylated target protein relays a signal into pathways that eventually feed back on the phosphorylation chain .",
    "( c ) simplification of ( b ) in which the fully phosphorylated target protein acquires kinase activity and directly feeds back on the chain .",
    "we refer to this network configuration as the asymmetric circuit .",
    "( d ) schematic of the network with symmetric feedback in which the substrate protein is bifunctional , whereby the fully ( de)phosphorylated form catalyzes ( de)phosphorylation of its own precursors .",
    "[ fig : schemes ] ]    we obtain positive feedback from intermolecular autocatalysis ; specifically , proteins in the @xmath12 state are kinases that act interchangeably with the exogenous kinases ( unequal catalytic power between @xmath13 and exogenous kinases can easily be added , at the cost of another parameter ) .",
    "the phosphorylation chain with feedback is shown in the bottom half of fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes ] .",
    "panel ( c ) depicts an asymmetric topology in which the fully phosphorylated substrate catalyzes its own phosphorylation , while panel ( d ) shows the symmetric version in which a substrate molecule is bifunctional , acting as both a kinase and phosphatase depending on its modification state .",
    "kinase @xmath6 and phosphatase @xmath7 are exogenous forces on the modification of the substrate , but the feedback is an endogenous force whose strength is proportional to the occupancy of the end - states of the chain . this occupancy is subject to intrinsic fluctuations and depends on the total number of substrate molecules .",
    "the assumption of intermolecular autocatalysis is standard  @xcite , and we consider below the self - consistent backgrounds with kinase - only autocatalysis , as the nearest equivalent to the kinetically - controlled switch  @xcite . in order to analyse the model beyond mean - field theory ( using field theoretic techniques ) we go",
    "further in the interest of simplicity , and symmetrize the topology as in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes]d , by making the unphosphorylated state ( indexed @xmath14 ) a phosphatase , interchangeable with the exogenous phosphatases .",
    "the feedback topology of the model caricatures a few elements present in biological systems .",
    "one such element is the competition between antagonistic pathways that may underlie cellular decision processes ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "a multisite phosphorylation chain of the type considered here could function as an evaluation point between competing and antagonistic pathways influenced by different active phosphoforms of the chain , provided these pathways feed back to the chain . in a less extreme case , the fully phosphorylated form activates another kinase which then interacts with the chain . in these scenarios ,",
    "feedback is mediated by a series of intervening processes , which may well affect the propagation of fluctuations . yet , if delays are not too large , the collapsed scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes]c could be a reasonable proxy with the added benefit of mathematical tractability .",
    "a scenario corresponding more literally to our model involves a bifunctional substrate capable of both kinase and phosphatase activity , depending on the substrate s modification state .",
    "one example is the hpr kinase / p - ser - hpr phosphatase ( hprk / p ) protein , which operates in the phosphoenolpyruvate : carbohydrate phosphotransferase system of gram - positive bacteria .",
    "upon stimulation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate , hprk / p catalyzes the phosphorylation of hpr at a seryl residue , while inorganic phosphate stimulates the opposing activity of dephosphorylating the seryl - phosphorylated hpr ( p - ser - hpr ) @xcite .",
    "another example of a bifunctional kinase / phosphatase is the nrii ( nitrogen regulator ii ) protein .",
    "it phosphorylates and dephosphorylates nri .",
    "nri and nrii constitute a bacterial two - component signaling system , in which nrii is the  transmitter \" and nri the  receiver \" that controls gene expression .",
    "nrii autophosphorylates at a histidine residue and transfers that phosphoryl group to nri .",
    "the phosphatase activity of nrii is stimulated by the pii signaling protein ( which also inhibits the kinase activity ) .",
    "several other transmitters in bacterial two - component systems seem to possess bifunctional kinase / phosphatase activity @xcite .    both the network with asymmetric topology ( auto - kinase only , fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes]c ) and the network with symmetric topology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes]d ) but asymmetric catalytic concentrations @xmath15 undergo formally first - order phase transitions , so that regions of bistability are always metastable at finite @xmath3 . however , in the topologically symmetric case , these continue smoothly through a second - order transition at @xmath16 , in which symmetry of both topology and parameters ensures exact bistability with finite residence time in domains , at all @xmath3 where the phase transitions exists .",
    "this simplification permits us to estimate the residence times with an expansion in semiclassical stationary points of an effective action , without encountering the complexities of path integrals for metastable processes  @xcite , though numerically we expect this also to be a good approximation to residence times in metastable states with similar `` barrier heights '' in the first - order case .",
    "symmetry also permits the closed - form computation of the noise kernel about the monostable phase with a unique equilibrium , which generates a natural measure for `` weakness '' or `` strongness '' of the first - order transitions at nearby values of @xmath17 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore perform a thorough analysis of the second - order transition , to establish methods and provide a reference solution to qualitatively understand the mechanisms of bistability and metastability in the more general cases with similar stochastic structure .      while differential equations for mean chemical concentrations ( the current standard method of analysis ) can give good estimates of the existence of hysteresis and bistability when approximating systems with as few as tens to hundreds of molecules , they of course preclude the treatment of noise , fluctuation - induced corrections to mean - field behavior at small particle number or near critical points , and large excursions such as domain flips ( when the system switches from one bistable state to another ) .",
    "pure mass - action models also ignore spatial constraints such as scaffolding by the cytoskeleton or the proteins themselves , and the dimensionality of physical diffusion in the cytosol or membranes .",
    "a better approximation is given by the master equation for the probability of instantaneous particle distributions in models like that of fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes ] , which in principle captures all orders of stochastic processes , though such simple models still omit spatial effects .",
    "the general properties of the master - equation ( in the diffusion , or `` fokker - planck '' approximation ) for a one - dimensional switch have been used to obtain scaling relations and loose bounds on the stability achievable from such a switch as a function of the number of molecules it employs  @xcite .",
    "operator methods , analogous to hamiltonian methods in quantum mechanics , have been developed in reaction - diffusion theory ( see  @xcite for a review ) to efficiently handle the collective excitations that diagonalize general master equations without time - reversal symmetry .",
    "these have been used in the context of gene expression  @xcite to estimate the number of stable cell types made possible by many randomly combined transcription factors , making use of similarities to ground states of random - bond ising models .    from the operator - valued evolution kernel",
    ", one can obtain an equivalent path - integral representation by expanding at each time in a basis of coherent states  @xcite .",
    "stationary - field expansion in the path integral generalizes the classical differential equation for concentrations to consistently incorporate fluctuation effects ( by means of a perturbatively - corrected effective action  @xcite ) , and the sum over `` approximate stationary points '' of locally least - action identify the typical configuration histories associated with domain flips .",
    "more sophisticated approaches , similar to those used here , have also been used to incorporate fluctuation effects into efficient lumped - parameter expansions for networks with multiple timescales  @xcite .",
    "master equations can also be solved numerically by the gillespie algorithm  @xcite , or simulated directly , and we use such simulations to validate our anlaytic results below . the lack of convenient symmetries in real biomolecular systems promises to make analysis intractable for most quantitative phenomenology , and recourse to numerics is likely to be the only general - purpose solution .",
    "however , the path integral s separation of moments in a natural small - parameter expansion , and of perturbative noise from formally non - perturbative large excursions , provides an intuitive decomposition of the mechanisms fundamental to switching and stability . at mean - field approximation",
    ", we find surprising similarities of the phase transition in this driven system to the magnetization transition in the discrete , equilibrium , mean - field ising ferromagnet , and a transition between this classical critical behavior at finite @xmath4 and a condensation effect more similar to bose - einstein condensation at @xmath18 .",
    "the algebraic distinction between self - consistent backgrounds , perturbative fluctuations , and non - perturbative domain flips , elementary in the analysis , is also a subtle distinction , difficult to make without systematic measurement biases , in the numerics .",
    "the mean - field results , which are reported in detail in  @xcite , and which can also be recovered from our effective - action treatment in this paper , reproduce the standard differential equations for mass action . the stationary states arise from conditions of detailed balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation , self - consistent with the concentrations they produce of autocatalytic phosphoepitopes in relation to exogenous catalysts .",
    "specifically , we show how both symmetric and asymmetric topologies create domains of mono- and bi - stability in the parameter space @xmath19 , and how the population asymmetry in the self - consistent state depends on the coupling @xmath20 and exogenous asymmetry @xmath17 .",
    "the perturbative expansion in gaussian fluctuations about the self - consistent background provides a systematic construction of the noise spectrum of the phosphorylation chain . at lowest order",
    "it predicts a cusp @xmath21 in the variance of the order parameter , equivalent to the curie - weiss prediction for the spin-@xmath22 mean - field ferromagnet .",
    "more surprising , we find that the entire perturbative approximation to the noise spectrum on all sites is generated from a single bare mode , effectively coupled to a single langevin field .",
    "this result replaces the _ ad hoc _ noise kernels one must entertain in the absence of a first - principles treatment  @xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative expansion in semiclassical configurations of locally least action predicts the leading large-@xmath3 dependence of the domain residence time in the bistable regime , as a function of the dimensionless rates of the problem @xmath17 and @xmath23 ( though here we solve only for the symmetric case @xmath24 , where bistability remains exact at finite particle numbers ) .",
    "these configurations , the dissipative equivalent to the instantons of euclidean equilibrium field theory  @xcite , solve two problems . first , from the high - dimensional configuration space of the @xmath3-particle , @xmath25-site chain , they extract the one - dimensional contour of most likely configurations to mediate domain flips , assumed given in ref .",
