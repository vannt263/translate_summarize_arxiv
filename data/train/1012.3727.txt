    "the main results of this manuscript , theorems  [ theorem : gls - cobordism ] and  [ theorem : twisted - gls - cobordism ] , are part of a long chain of localization results in topology . here , by a _ localization result _ we mean a formula that expresses a global topological or geometric quantity on a manifold @xmath2 as a sum of local contributions near a subset of @xmath2 such as the fixed point set of a torus action or of a diffeomorphism , the zero set of a vector field , or the critical set of a function .",
    "this idea has a long history ; early results of this general nature are , for instance , the poincar - hopf index theorem , the lefschetz fixed point theorem , and the early works @xcite of bott .",
    "other results that relate to our current work are . to place our results in the appropriate context , below we give a very brief sketch of this circle of ideas , focusing on aspects that directly relate to our results .",
    "we begin by discussing the classical duistermaat - heckman exact stationary phase formula , which is probably the first such localization result in modern symplectic geometry .",
    "we will go back and forth between two different perspectives that are frequently encountered in the literature and which are related by a fourier transform .",
    "let @xmath3 be a compact symplectic manifold , equipped with an action of a torus @xmath4 with associated momentum map @xmath5 .",
    "in their original papers  @xcite , duistermaat and heckman consider the oscillatory integral @xmath6 over @xmath2 of the function @xmath7 times the liouville measure , where @xmath8 denotes the component of the momentum map for @xmath9 .",
    "they then prove an _ exact stationary phase formula _ which expresses this integral as the sum of local contributions near the fixed points of the @xmath4-action .",
    "recall that _",
    "liouville measure _ on @xmath2 is obtained by integration of @xmath10 , the symplectic volume form .",
    "the _ duistermaat ",
    "measure on @xmath11 , which we denote @xmath12 , is the push - forward of liouville measure via the momentum map @xmath5 .",
    "the integral   is essentially the fourier transform , denoted @xmath13 , of the measure .",
    "this can be seen from the following computation : for @xmath9 , @xmath14 where the first equality follows from the definition of fourier transform and the second equality follows from the definition of the measure .    the integral   can also be interpreted as a push - forward in equivariant cohomology . with this interpretation , the exact stationary phase formula becomes a special case of a localization formula in equivariant cohomology .",
    "this important formula was observed by berline and vergne and by atiyah and bott , and hence it is often referred to as the  abbv formula \" . for details see  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to relax some of the assumptions on the manifold @xmath2 and the @xmath0-form @xmath1 and still have versions of the exact stationary phase formula , as we now describe .",
    "one such relaxation is to allow the closed @xmath0-form @xmath1 to be degenerate .",
    "the manifold @xmath2 must then be equipped with an orientation , so that we can still integrate the symplectic volume form .",
    "if @xmath2 is compact then the measure remains well - defined as a signed measure .",
    "the exact stationary phase formula continues to hold in this generality ; indeed , it still follows from the abbv formula .    if the manifold @xmath2 is not compact , but the momentum map @xmath15 is proper , then the measure can be defined as a distribution , even if @xmath1 is degenerate . in this paper",
    "we mainly work with this _ distribution _ ( see  definition  [ dh distribution ] ) .",
    "in this situation , there might not exist a localization formula to the fixed point set ; there might not even be any fixed points .",
    "( this can be seen , for instance , from the example of the action of a torus @xmath4 on its cotangent bundle @xmath16 with the momentum map being the projection to @xmath11 . )",
    "however if we additionally assume that @xmath15 has a component that is proper and bounded from below , then there does exist a localization formula which expresses the distribution as a sum of contributions given in terms of infinitesimal data along the components of the @xmath4-fixed point set .",
    "guillemin , lerman , and sternberg derived a formula of this form for the dh measure when @xmath2 is compact and @xmath4 is a torus acting with isolated fixed points @xcite .",
    "their proof uses an ( inverse ) fourier transform applied to the left and right hand sides of the original dh formula for  .",
    "the case of non - isolated fixed points is worked out by guillemin and cannas da silva in @xcite ; the case that a component of the momentum map is proper and bounded from below is analyzed by prato and wu  @xcite .    with these historical remarks in hand",
    ", we can describe the motivations and main contributions of the present manuscript .",
    "one of our major motivations was to further develop the point of view ( initiated in  @xcite and developed in  @xcite ) that it is possible to derive the above - mentioned localization formulae @xcite _ directly _ , without passing through fourier transforms .",
    "the main technique for doing so is an appropriate notion of noncompact cobordism , under the hypothesis that a component of the momentum map is proper and bounded below . indeed , using cobordisms , one can prove a guillemin - lerman - sternberg - type formula in the more general situation of non - isolated fixed points and non - compact @xmath2 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "11 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  4 , sec .  6 ) ) .",
    "here we take a moment to sketch some of the history of cobordisms in symplectic geometry .",
    "the idea originates from the work of guillemin and sternberg , who observe in @xcite that two compact hamiltonian symplectic manifolds have the same duistermaat - heckman measure if they are hamiltonianly cobordant through a compact manifold @xmath17 .",
    "this is a simple consequence of stokes theorem .",
    "shaun martin used cobordisms in the context of equivariant localization in @xcite .",
    "guillemin , ginzburg , and the second author , in @xcite , allow for _ non - compact _ hamiltonian manifolds and use noncompact cobordisms to derive localization results . in this setting , to deal with the lack of compactness , one restricts attention to momentum maps that are proper .",
    "moreover , one often makes the stricter requirement that the momentum map is  polarized \" , i.e. , it has a component that is proper and bounded from below .",
    "this important technical condition on momentum maps first appeared in the work of prato and wu @xcite .",
    "our work generalizes and extends the cobordism ideas in @xcite by introducing the notions of a * taming map * and a * @xmath18-polarized momentum map * , as we now explain .",
    "the basic idea is that we allow the component @xmath18 of the momentum map @xmath15  with respect to which the function @xmath19 must be proper and bounded from below ( i.e. , `` polarized '' )  to _ vary _ along the manifold .",
    "more precisely , suppose @xmath2 is a @xmath4-manifold .",
    "we fix a _ taming map _",
    "@xmath20 , so named because we use it to control situations when the manifold is not compact .",
    "then we require the function obtained by pairing the @xmath11-valued momentum map with this taming map to be proper and bounded from below , giving us the notion of a _ @xmath18-polarized momentum map_. in the special case that @xmath21 is constant , we recover the _",
    "@xmath22-polarized _ condition of  @xcite .",
    "our notion of a taming map is motivated by work of maxim braverman @xcite , although our assumptions on the map @xmath18 slightly differ from his .",
    "we now describe in more detail the main results of this paper .",
    "let @xmath4 be a compact lie group , @xmath2 an even - dimensional oriented @xmath4-manifold , @xmath1 a @xmath4-invariant closed @xmath0-form ( not necessarily symplectic ) , and @xmath23 a @xmath4-equivariant function such that hamilton s equation @xmath24 holds for all @xmath9 .",
    "( we call such a triple a * hamiltonian @xmath4-manifold * , although  contrary to the standard use of the term in the literature  we do not require @xmath25 to be symplectic . ) a taming map @xmath18 determines a vector field @xmath26 on @xmath2 via the infinitesimal action of the lie algebra @xmath27 on @xmath2 .",
    "the localizing set in our theory is the zero set @xmath28 of this vector field .",
    "the main results of our manuscript , theorems  [ theorem : gls - cobordism ] and  [ theorem : twisted - gls - cobordism ] , express the duistermaat - heckman distribution of the hamiltonian @xmath4-manifold @xmath29 ( respectively twisted duistermaat - heckman distribution ) in terms of local data on arbitrarily small neighborhoods of @xmath30 .",
    "namely , let @xmath31 be the decomposition of @xmath30 into its connected components",
    ". then our theorem  [ theorem : gls - cobordism ] takes the form @xmath32 and , in the twisted case , our theorem  [ theorem : twisted - gls - cobordism ] takes the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an equivariant cohomology class on @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath35th summand on the right hand side is defined to be the duistermaat - heckman distribution ( respectively twisted duistermaat - heckman distribution ) of a @xmath18-*polarized completion * relative to @xmath36 ( made precise in definition  [ definition : v - polarized - completion ] ) of the restriction of @xmath37 to an arbitrarily small @xmath4-invariant neighbourhood of the connected component @xmath36 of @xmath30 .",
    "the notation @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) , which makes no mention of the choice of a neighbourhood or of a @xmath18-polarized completion , is justified since we prove in section  [ sec : dh ] ( respectively section  [ sec : twisteddh ] ) that under appropriate hypotheses this distribution ( respectively twisted duistermaat - heckman distribution ) is in fact _ independent of these choices_. in this sense the right hand sides of   and   depend only on data that is localized near @xmath30 , and thus it is valid to view our results as a `` localization to @xmath30 '' .",
    "we emphasize that the specific form of the right hand side varies according to choice of @xmath18 ( and hence @xmath30 ) , so actually each of   and   is a _ family _ of formulas ; we explicitly demonstrate this using a simple example in section  [ sec : sphere ] .",
    "next we relate our main results to another related circle of ideas , namely that of the so - called nonabelian localization and localization with respect to the norm - square of the momentum map .",
    "we begin with a brief historical account .",
    "the ` nonabelian localization ' theory was initiated by witten , who considers integrals of the form @xmath40 where @xmath22 is an equivariant differential form , @xmath41 is a volume form on @xmath27 , the @xmath42 is a real parameter , and @xmath15 again denotes the momentum map for a hamiltonian @xmath4-action ( see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) .",
    "the group @xmath4 may be nonabelian .",
    "the integral   can be interpreted as the evaluation on the gaussian @xmath43 of a twisted dh distribution @xmath44 on @xmath27 .",
    "( mild assumptions on @xmath2 guarantee that this distribution is a temperate ( a.k.a tempered ) distribution , so its evaluation on the gaussian is well defined . ) witten then gives a formula similar in spirit to the abelian abbv localization formula mentioned above ; he expresses as a sum of local contributions from the components of the critical set of @xmath45 , where the dominant contribution as @xmath46 is from the absolute minimum @xmath47 .",
    "( in fact witten s theory is slightly more general : he begins with a localization formula which depends on a choice of closed invariant 1-form @xmath48 on @xmath2 and leads to a sum of local contributions from the components of the set @xmath49 for appropriate vector fields @xmath50 .",
    "he then specializes to the case @xmath51 , for which the set   is @xmath52 . )",
    "witten s results may be considered an extension of the abelian duistermaat - heckman theory , in that it firstly introduces more general integrands ( which correspond to the twisted duistermaat - heckman distributions of section  [ sec : twisteddh ] ) , and secondly it produces formulas which localize to @xmath53 , the components of the critical set of the norm - square of @xmath15 , instead of the fixed points of the action .",
    "some years later , jeffrey and kirwan derived similar formulas by working through the maximal torus @xmath54 of a compact nonabelian lie group @xmath4 ; they also explain the relation of their formula to that of witten s in @xcite .",
    "kefeng liu gives simplified proofs of some of these results in @xcite .",
    "more recently , paradan @xcite and woodward @xcite develop a localization theory for the norm - square @xmath45 of the momentum map which incorporates the witten integrals above , deriving formulas for ( the fourier transforms of ) the twisted duistermaat ",
    "heckman distributions as sums of local contributions associated to components of the critical set of @xmath45",
    ".    our main theorems also generalize ( the inverse fourier transforms of ) the nonabelian localization formulas to @xmath53 , under the assumption that the connected components of @xmath53 are smooth .",
    "( we expect this assumption to not be necessary ; see remark  [ technical hypothesis ] . )",
    "namely , we express the ( twisted ) distribution as a sum of local contributions .",
    "our formulas rely on a choice of taming map @xmath55 , which can be obtained from a choice of a real valued function @xmath56 by  .",
    "the localizing set is then the critical set of the composition @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath4 is a torus and @xmath58 is a linear functional , as described in our example  [ example : prato - wu ] , our theorem  [ theorem : gls - cobordism ] recovers the so - called gls formula @xcite .",
    "when @xmath58 is the norm square function @xmath59 , as described in our in example  [ example : norm - square ] , we recover the localizing set @xmath53 of witten , paradan , and woodward @xcite .",
    "our results also answer a question asked some time ago by shlomo sternberg concerning the brianchon - gram polytope decomposition .",
    "it is known that the atiyah - bott - berline - verge localization theorem in equivariant cohomology @xcite , when applied to the exponent of the equivariant symplectic form of a compact symplectic toric manifold , yields the measure - theoretic version of the lawrence - varchenko polytope decomposition @xcite , when applied to the corresponding momentum polytope .",
    "sternberg had asked whether there is a similar ` localization - theoretic ' interpretation of the classical brianchon - gram polytope decomposition .",
    "we can answer sternberg s question in the affirmative : a special case of theorem  [ theorem : gls - cobordism ] , applied to the exponent of the equivariant symplectic form on a compact symplectic toric manifold , yields ( the measure - theoretic version of ) the brianchon - gram polytope decomposition for the momentum polytope .",
    "however , this application requires the fact that , for any simple polytope , there exists a smooth function with a unique critical point on the relative interior of every face of that polytope ( and satisfies some additional technical conditions ) . if the polytope satisfies a technical assumption ( recorded in ) , then the norm - square function has this property .",
    "surprisingly , proving that for _ any _ simple polytope there exists such a function turned out to be not entirely trivial , and our proof ( by brute - force differential topology on @xmath60 ) occupies appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .    in future work",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate whether our results generalize to @xmath4-spaces that are not manifolds .",
    "( such a generalization may correspond to polytope decompositions for _ non - simple _ polytopes , such as haase s generalization of the lawrence - varchenko decomposition to non - simple polytopes @xcite , or the brianchon - gram decomposition applied to non - simple polytopes . )",
    "it would also be interesting to see if a combination of our results with braverman s work in @xcite would yield new index formulas .",
    "we now give an outline of the contents of this paper . in section  [ sec : taming ] , we define the taming map and the corresponding localizing set and we describe some of our motivating examples . in section  [ sec : polarized - completions ] , we define @xmath18-polarized completions and prove that they exist .",
    "we note that polarized completions are used both in the formulation of our localization formulas   and   and in their proof .",
    "we prove the untwisted version of our localization formula , theorem  [ theorem : gls - cobordism ] , in section  [ sec : dh ] and the twisted version , theorem  [ theorem : twisted - gls - cobordism ] , in section  [ sec : twisteddh ] . in section  [ sec : brianchongram ] we discuss the brianchon - gram polytope decomposition and answer sternberg s question in the affirmative . in section  [ sec : sphere ] , we use the standard @xmath61-action on @xmath62 in order to illustrate in detail how our equation   can yield different localization formulas by choosing different taming maps .",

    "the  varying polarization \" of our localization formulas is controlled by a so - called taming map . in this section",

    "the zero set of this vector field @xmath84 will serve as the _ localizing set _ for our theory , in the sense that our localization formulas give expressions for global invariants ( namely , duistermaat - heckman distributions ) in terms of data near the localizing sets :     the * localizing set * associated to the taming map @xmath75 is defined by @xmath85    if @xmath69 is a @xmath4-manifold with boundary , @xmath75 is a taming map , and @xmath86 is in the boundary of @xmath69 , then @xmath87 is tangent to the boundary and @xmath88 .",

    "since @xmath1289 agrees with @xmath830 on a neighbourhood of @xmath985 , it suffices to check this condition on @xmath1324 since @xmath1325 by construction of @xmath308 , and the three functions @xmath1326 and @xmath1283 are independent of the @xmath709 variables , we have @xmath1327 \\\\   & = \\rho_1(x ) ( df_{\\ell-1})(\\xi_j|_x ) - \\rho_2(x ) \\\\   & < 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as desired , since @xmath1328 by assumption and at least one of @xmath265 or @xmath266 must be positive at any @xmath1329 this completes the proof of the claim and hence of the statements ( a ) and ( b ) in proposition  [ prop : bump - function new ] .",

    "the function defined in   has the property that @xmath1330 and hence , along the face @xmath613 , is equal to @xmath1273 .",
    "the explicit formula for @xmath1273 in   shows that , in appropriate coordinates along the face @xmath613 , the function @xmath1273 is quadratic in the coordinates up to an affine translation in @xmath203 , as desired .",
    "moreover , the explicit formula for @xmath1289 in   shows that with respect to the coordinates @xmath1331 in   is linear in the coordinates @xmath709 and decreases in the directions pointing into the polytope @xmath613 , again as desired .",
    "since the vector fields @xmath850 are also arranged to be constant sufficiently near @xmath643 , the coordinates @xmath1331 are in fact affine .",

    "<S> the main contribution of this paper is a generalization of several previous localization theories in equivariant symplectic geometry , including the classical atiyah - bott / berline - vergne localization theorem , as well as many cases of the localization via the norm - square of the momentum map as initiated and developed by witten , paradan , and woodward . </S>",
    "<S> our version unifies and generalizes these theories by using noncompact cobordisms as in previous work of guillemin , ginzburg , and karshon , and by introducing a more flexible notion of ` polarization ' than in previous theories . </S>",
    "<S> our localization formulas are also valid for closed @xmath0-forms @xmath1 that may be degenerate . as a corollary , we are able to answer a question posed some time ago by shlomo sternberg concerning the classical brianchon - gram polytope decomposition , . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our theory using concrete examples motivated by our answer to sternberg s question .        _ dedicated to the memory of hans duistermaat _ </S>"
