    ", such a second order phase transition could be avoided if the fluctuations are strong enough , the system evading the associated entropy by undergoing a first order transition without any divergence of the correlation length .    in b20 itinerant chiral magnets like mnsi , fege or mnge ,",
    "the crucial role of the spin fluctuations appears already in the ground state , when applied pressure induces a first order quantum transition from the ordered helical state to a non fermi liquid state with partial magnetic order , involving chiral fluctuations of local magnetic moments @xcite . at finite temperature and under magnetic field ,",
    "an intermediate chiral phase ( also called fluctuation disordered regime ) is stabilized between the ordered and paramagnetic phases .",
    "the nature of this phase has been discussed in the literature .",
    "one explanation invokes chiral mesophases in analogy with chiral nematics , including disordered of liquid phases composed of skyrmionic double twisted or multiply twisted spin textures@xcite .",
    "another scenario assumes fluctuating helices @xcite with finite lengthscale , isotropically distributed in space , and a fluctuation induced first order transition @xcite as explained by brazovskii universality @xcite .",
    "the chiral fluctuations could be the source of soft modes , stabilizing a skyrmion lattice phase in mnsi and fege just below the ordering transition@xcite .    in this series",

    "the static lro helices disappear but sro helices remain .",
    "ferromagnetic correlations persist up to about 250k , with a coherence length below the typical helical wavelength .",
    "low field magnetic irreversibilities are seen even above , up to 300k at least , showing that some sort of slow dynamics coexists with rapid spin fluctuations deeply in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "the nature and origin of the spin fluctuations in mnge and the intrinsic inhomogenetity of its chiral order are matter of debate .",
    "the peculiar band structure of mnge yields three possible states for the mn moment , namely high spin , low spin and zero spin ( called hs , ls and zs respectively)@xcite , which can be stabilized depending on the interatomic distance .",
    "therefore , the transition between spin states can be driven by an applied pressure .",
    "high pressure neutron diffraction @xcite shows that the collapse of the ordered mn moment in the ground state occurs in two steps , around 7 gpa and above 13 gpa respectively .",
    "x ray data measured up to 30 gpa @xcite suggest that the same scenario is at play for the local moment in the paramagnetic phase at 300k .",
    "altogether , the pressure data suggest a first order transition line between hs and ls states , stabilized in a very large t range .",
    "this scenario yields a possible route for unconventional invar - like spin fluctuations , needed to accommodate hs and ls regions with different specific volumes .",
    "we have investigated mnge by @xmath0sr . at low temperature ( t = 10k ) when the frozen helical order is stabilized , we observe a complex oscillating asymmetry as in mnsi @xcite .",
    "following ref . , we account for it by calculating the distribution of dipolar fields at the muon sites .",
    "our analysis allows us to identify the muon stopping site in good agreement with an _ ab initio _ model and to determine the contact field on the muon site . with increasing temperature we use @xmath0sr to probe the spin fluctuations at a longer time scale ( 10@xmath5s ) than the mssbauer ( 10@xmath6s ) or neutron ( 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath8s ) probes .",
