    "heavily boron ( b ) doped diamond structures without electronically compensating effects have been theoretically predicted to become high - temperature superconductors provided the substitutional concentration is high enough  @xcite . indeed , in the last decade , superconductivity in b - doped diamond has been observed for single crystal  @xcite and also for nanocrystalline diamond films  @xcite .",
    "chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) growth in the @xmath0100@xmath1 direction is able to incorporate boron up to 10  at.%  @xcite , but a significant amount of hydrogen incorporation into the crystal compensates much of the boron and limits the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 to about 6  k. recently , signatures of high @xmath2 values around 25  k were reported in higher quality cvd grown heavily boron - doped single - crystal diamond  @xcite , corresponding to a carrier concentration of @xmath33.1@xmath410@xmath5  @xmath6 ( = 1.8  at.@xmath7 ) .",
    "interestingly , according to their calculations , if substitutional doped boron could be arranged periodically or the degree of disorder reduced , a @xmath2 of approximately 100  k could be achieved via minimal percent doping .",

    ", in contrast to kev energies , creates a buried b doped layer with a relatively undamaged diamond capping which acts to pressurise the implanted zone and inhibits the transformation to graphite .",
    "in addition , mev implantation has the additional benefit that the vacancy rich region is offset from the b peak , which results in a separation between the conducting layer and the electronically compensating effects .    in the present work ,",
    "the possibility of creating a high - temperature superconductor via b - implanting diamond films was explored .",
    "ion - implantation of diamond plates ( through hard masks ) allows complete control of doping type , concentration and depth profile , which is beneficial for device fabrication purposes .",
    "when b is introduced by high pressure high temperature ( hpht ) methods , the maximum concentration is determined by the solubility of b in carbon .",
    "this limitation is overcome when using either cvd or ion - implantation . for the ion - implantation technique",
    "the fluences required usually result in graphitization  @xcite , a process that can not be reversed  @xcite . here , we take advantage of ( i ) high energy implantation to bury the b layer deep inside the diamond where it is subjected to high internal pressures , keeping the lattice intact even under extreme implantation conditions , ( ii ) high temperature implantation to promote dynamic annealing during the implantation to inhibit graphitization  @xcite .",
    "residual damage can then be removed by a post implantation annealing step  @xcite .",

    "2 mev boron ions were implanted into 2 diamond plates held at a temperature of 600@xmath8c : the first plate ( a ) was implanted to 2@xmath410@xmath9  b  @xmath10 and a second plate ( b ) to 1@xmath410@xmath11  b  @xmath10 .",
    "the fluence for these implants should in theory allow the charge density to reach the metal - insulator - transition ( mit ) at about 4.5@xmath410@xmath12  @xmath6 ( = 0.26  at.@xmath7 )  @xcite , assuming a high level of activation .",
    "for cvd grown films a superconducting phase transition was observed for a critical boron density  @xcite of 3@xmath410@xmath12  @xmath6 .",
    "post - implant , these plates were bristol acid boiled , to remove the surface graphitisation  , and annealed in vacuum at a temperature of @xmath13=1300@xmath8c for 10 - 15  minutes to activate the boron ions and recover the diamond lattice from implantation damage . to create robust , low - resistance electrical contacts to the sub - surface layer",
    "a laser milling and back brazing process was developed  @xcite .",
    "the diamond plates were patterned with 4 electrodes ( with a 500  @xmath14 m contact spacing ) to form a van der pauw square  @xcite device configuration . to obtain an estimate for the thickness of the buried layer we relied on the doping profile ( full width half maximum ) from stopping - and - range - of - ions - in - matter ( srim ) simulations  @xcite , predicting a sheet thickness of @xmath15=@xmath3100  nm  75  nm .",

    "since all implants are the same energy , the sheet thickness becomes a scaling factor that affects all measurements equally .",
    "importantly , the srim simulation predicts a peak b concentration of 2@xmath410@xmath5  b  @xmath6 , and 1@xmath410@xmath18  b  @xmath6 , for a fluence of 2@xmath410@xmath9  b  @xmath10 and 1@xmath410@xmath11  b  @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these concentrations correspond to an atomic boron percentage of 1.2  at.@xmath7 , and 6  at.@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this result will later be used for calculating the boron activation fraction .",
    "to map out the doping profile as a function of depth ( after device fabrication and electronic characterization ) , dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) was performed on plates a and b. for this analysis , in a cameca ims 5fe7 instrument , a primary ion oxygen ( @xmath19 ) beam was used with an impact energy of 7.5  kev and a beam current of 200  na to raster a 180  @xmath14 m x 180  @xmath14 m region of the surface . using these settings , a total depth of 2.27",
    "@xmath14 m was profiled with an analysis area of 33  @xmath14 m in diameter .",
    "the diamond plates were gold coated beforehand and an in - situ electron beam was used to prevent sample charging during the analysis .",

    "the sims analysis was always undertaken centrally on the sample area that was characterized electrically .",
    "the sputter rate was determined by assessing the depth of the analysis crater using a kla tencor alpha - step iq profilometer and was determined to be 0.474  nm / s .    here , we used a standard sample with a known boron concentration to work out the relative sensitivity factor ( rsf ) .",
    "we also used a second method to obtain the rsf by integrating the sims spectrum to yield the value for the fluence used for that implant .",
    "even though the first method was used to relate the sims intensity to a b concentration , the ion profiles produced by the two methods were very similar .",
    "the resulting spectra were then compared to the srim predicted ion profile for plate b ( black ) , c.f .",
    "[ sims_srim ] .",
    "the sims analysis shows that the peak concentration for plate b ( blue ) is close to 1@xmath410@xmath18  b  @xmath6 , in agreement with srim simulations .",
    "the difference @xmath24 in projected range @xmath17 can be corrected for when taking into account a scaling factor , which reflects a reduction in diamond density resulting from the device fabrication .",
    "the scaling factors are 0.89 for plate a and 0.847 for plate b , respectively",
    ". the effective diamond density in the cap can be calculated by multiplying the scaling factor with the diamond density ( 3.52  gr @xmath6 ) .",
    "the peak concentration ratio between plate b and a ( red ) is 3.7x , whereas it was expected to be a factor of 5x ( the integrated areas under the sims peaks scale as 3.9x . ) .",
    "this difference can be explained by the error in setting the fluence for each of the separate timed implantation runs .",
    "the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the boron peak concentration for both plates yields a thickness of @xmath390  nm , close to the predicted 100  nm , which demonstrates limited diffusion of boron during high temperature annealing .",
    "room temperature ( rt ) raman and photoluminescence ( pl ) spectroscopy were performed to determine the crystal damage after ( hot ) implantation  @xcite and after annealing , respectively .",
    "the excitation laser used had a wavelength of 532  nm .",
    "figures  [ pl_before_after](a)-(b ) show the pl spectra at each stage of the processing , i.e. pristine , hot implanted and high - temperature annealed .",
    "these spectra are normalized to the diamond peak intensity and offset for clarity .",
    "the main feature is the sharp peak at 572  nm , corresponding to the first order raman line , and the photoluminescence signals related to nitrogen vacancy centers ( nv@xmath25 at 637  nm and nv@xmath26 at 575  nm ) in the crystal .",
    "the nv peaks are clearly visible before and after the implantation and annealing steps .    to investigate the implantation damage and effect of annealing , raman spectra were taken , as shown in figs .",
    "[ raman_before_after](a)-(b ) . for plate a , c.f .",
    "[ raman_before_after](a ) ( red ) there are three peaks visible in the 1400 - 1800  @xmath27 range , resulting from the ion - implantation process : there is a small peak visible near 1451  @xmath27 ( inset ) and a larger peak at around 1501  @xmath27 , which appear to be unique to high - energy implantation into diamond  @xcite .",
    "a third large peak at 1637  @xmath27 has previously been attributed to a split - interstitial  @xcite and anneals out above 1300@xmath8c .",
    "interestingly , the implantation process quenches the nv@xmath26 pl signal ( observed at 1427  @xmath27 ) .",
    "no significant shift of the diamond peak was observed .    in the raman spectrum of plate b , c.f .",
    "[ raman_before_after](b ) ( red ) , we again observe several peaks at 1498  @xmath27 and 1637  @xmath27 consistent with the presence of vacancies and split interstitials  @xcite .",

    "post hta , there are no more defect peaks visible in the 1000 - 2000  @xmath27 waveshift range for plate a , except for a 1559  @xmath27 peak ( red trace ) , which is usually attributed to disordered sp@xmath28 bonded carbon atoms .",
    "the raman spectrum for plate b post - hta indicates that the high temperature annealing repairs most of the damage associated with the ion - implantation process as no more damage peaks can be observed .",
    "furthermore , post hta , the diamond peak , as well as the nv@xmath26 pl peak increase in intensity ( when the data is not normalized to the diamond peak ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the diamond lattice has been preserved as far as raman spectroscopy is concerned . in particular , despite the extremely high fluence of 1@xmath410@xmath11  b  @xmath10",
    "there is no evidence of graphitization .",
    "the hot mev implantation followed by a hta method allows very high concentrations of b to be introduced into the lattice ( see table  [ tab : data_summary ] ) , while still maintaining the integrity of the diamond lattice structure .",
    "low temperature electronic transport measurements were performed as a function of temperature and magnetic field . from these measurements we extract thermally",
    "activated behaviour of the conductivity .",
    "furthermore , from hall measurements we extract a charge density and carrier mobility , which can be compared to values extracted from magneto - resistance . to this end",
    "we used a cryogen - free dilution refrigerator ( leiden cryogenics ) with insertable probe to quickly cooldown samples from rt down to @xmath34 - 5  k. the system incorporates a superconducting magnet for both magneto - resistance and hall measurements . for rt measurements we used a permanent magnet",
    "the methodology for calculating the ` bulk ' resistivity @xmath29 of the sub - surface conducting layer was as follows . at room temperature , current - voltage ( i - v ) measurements were taken to extract the 4-terminal square resistance ( @xmath30 ) of the plates , which multiplied by the buried layer thickness directly provides @xmath29=@xmath31 @xmath15 .",
    "the result of a hall measurement on plate a is shown in fig .",
    "[ plateavst](a ) . to obtain those data ,",
    "we ramp the source - drain current @xmath32 from -2 to + 2  ma and record the source - drain voltage @xmath33 and the hall voltage @xmath34 simultaneously for both + 0.34  t and -0.34  t. the data corresponding to opposite magnetic fields are then subtracted ( symmetrized ) and divided by 2 to obtain the effective hall voltage @xmath35=0.5(@xmath36 - @xmath37 ) .",
    "the resulting slope then represents the hall resistance over a magnetic field range of @xmath38=0.34  t. here , the hall scattering factors are assumed to be unity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and citations therein ) .",
    "the extracted hall slope in units of @xmath39/t equals 47.8  m@xmath39/t , which corresponds to a 2d carrier density of @xmath40=1.30@xmath410@xmath9  @xmath10 . assuming a thickness of 100  nm , and with a sheet resistance of 270  @xmath39 , the 3d density equals @xmath41=(1.30  @xmath42  0.008 ) @xmath410@xmath5  @xmath6 and the resistivity equals @xmath29=2.7  m@xmath39-cm with a mobility of @xmath14=(1.77  @xmath42  0.01 )  cm@xmath28v@xmath44s@xmath44 .",

    "this value is much less than @xmath47=0.37  ev  @xcite , which is typically cited for b - doped diamond .",
    "this inconsistency does not necessarily imply that the conduction observed here is due to some defect other than b. in  @xcite it was shown that for very low resistance samples the exponential dependence on inverse temperature shifts to higher temperatures and the corresponding ionization energy becomes smaller and smaller in accordance with a metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "the inset shows how the conductivity decreases with lowering the temperature on a linear scale .",

    "[ plateavst](c ) .",
    "the sample shows a significant resistance increase below 4  k. we expect that upon cooling down to the mk regime , charge carriers localize in electronic trap states , resulting in a freeze out that increases the resistance exponentially .",

    "this tells us that the contact resistance is significant here and the conductivity of the material itself is low .",
    "since these values are much lower than those for plate a , it confirms our expectations for implantation to a higher fluence .",
    "the rt carrier density of plate b was measured again by symmetrization . since plate b is likely to have a higher carrier density it is harder to extract the hall voltage ( since the hall coefficient is inversely proportional to the carrier concentration ) , especially with small values of magnetic field available .",

    "this type of dependence ( pmr ) suggests a localisation of the wave functions on boron atoms .",
    "basically , with increasing magnetic field , a shrinkage of the wave functions leads to a progressive localisation resulting in decrease of the conductivity , i.e. a pmr  @xcite .",

    "raman and pl spectroscopy show that graphitization can be prevented by the use of high temperature dynamic annealing during the mev implantation .",
    "post - implantation annealing at even higher temperatures results in removal of remaining point defects .",
    "the low temperature electrical measurements of the heavily doped samples reveal an activation energy of about 1  mev over the range from rt to about 100  k. magnetoresistance measurements at low temperatures show evidence for localization of the electronic wavefunction ( holes ) on the boron atoms . despite the very high b concentration and apparent integrity of the diamond lattice , no superconducting transition could be observed .",
    "these results suggest that higher fluences and/or more effective ( in - situ ) annealing techniques may be required to further eliminate electronic defects in order to realise implantation - based diamond superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , electronic grade diamond plates with parts per billion ( ppb ) rather than parts per million ( ppm ) nitrogen content may reduce the effects of compensation doping and scattering . nevertheless , with standard grade diamond plates very high dopant activation was achieved with rt carrier densities above the mit critical limit .",
