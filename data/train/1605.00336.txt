    "the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) for stars in the milky way is of great importance to reveal the chemical structure of galactic halo and disk systems , and provides essential clues to the assembly and enrichment history of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "many multi - fiber spectroscopic surveys , including the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the radial velocity experiment ( rave ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have obtained metallicity estimates and other stellar parameters for millions of stars from low- and medium - resolution spectra . however , compared with photometric data , the number of spectra within the limiting magnitudes of the surveys is still too small to provide a detailed chemical map of the galaxy , even in the relatively local region .",
    "the use of photometric data , which is available for far more stars than the spectroscopic data , breaks through this limitation .    considering that the exhaustion of metals in a stellar atmosphere has a detectable effect on the emergent flux @xcite ,",
    "in particular in the blue region where the density of metal absorption is highest , the combination of spectroscopic data and photometric data can be used to derive estimates of [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite derived approximate stellar metallicities through measurement of the ultraviolet excess , based on @xmath15 data in sa 141 .",
    "@xcite employed sdss data to derive a metallicity estimator from @xmath16 and @xmath17 colors , and successfully mapped the metallicity distribution of millions of f / g main - sequence stars within a distance of @xmath18 kpc from the sun .",
    "@xcite also used batc survey data to estimate the stellar photometric metallicity distribution .",
    "@xcite obtained a metallicity estimator using scuss @xcite data , which can be applied up to fainter magnitudes due to the use of more accurate scuss @xmath19-band measurements , and used it to explore the metallicity of the sagittarius stream in the south galactic cap . using a minimum @xmath20 technique ,",
    "@xcite estimated photometric metallicities simultaneously using the dereddened colors @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 from the sdss and metallicity - dependent stellar loci .",
    "@xcite calibrated stellar isochrones to derive metallicities of individual stars with sdss @xmath23 photometry .",
    "( 2015 ) applied this method to recently improved co - adds of @xmath23 photometry for stripe 82 from sdss , including a factor of two more stars than their previous effort .",
    "the new analysis revealed a mdf for halo stars between 5 and 10 kpc from the sun with peak metallicities at [ fe / h ] @xmath24 and [ fe / h ] @xmath25 , which the authors associated with the inner - halo and outer - halo populations of the milky way , respectively .",
    "the photometric metallicity calibrations developed by previous works are characterized by their assignment of a star - by - star metallicity estimate based on its color indexes .",
    "this inevitably introduces error , because a single star s metallicity is actually uncertain even when its color indexes are fixed , varying around the metallicity estimate to form a distribution .",
    "in addition , the calibration methods used by @xcite and @xcite yield poor results for very metal - rich or very metal - poor stars . however , in order to investigate the chemical structure of the galactic stellar populations , we only require knowledge of the mdf for a large statistical sample of stars . here",
    "we develop a monte - carlo method to estimate the photometric metallicity distribution of large number of stars with available sdss photometry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide a brief overview of the sdss and its photometric data .",
    "details of our monte - carlo based photometric metallicity calibration are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents a comparison between this method and the more traditional polynomial - fitting method . as an example , in section 5 we apply this method to derive the mdf for galactic stars and consider its variation with height above the plane .",
    "a brief summary is given in section 6 .",
    "the sdss is a large international collaboration project , and it has obtained deep , multi - color images covering more than one - quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap , as well as a small ( @xmath26 deg@xmath27 ) , but much deeper survey , in the south galactic hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the sdss used a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope at apache point observatory , new mexico @xcite .",
    "the flux densities are measured in five bands ( @xmath19 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) with effective wavelengths of 3551 , 4686 , 6165 , 7481 and 8931  , respectively .",
    "the @xmath32 completeness limits of the images are 22.0 , 22.2 , 22.2 , 21.3 , and 20.5 for @xmath19 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively @xcite . the relative photometric calibration accuracy for @xmath19 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are 2% , 1% , 1% , 1% and 1% , respectively @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the error of @xmath19- , @xmath28- , and @xmath29-band magnitude as a function of @xmath28-band magnitudes .",
    "other technical details about sdss can be found on the sdss website _ http://www.sdss3.org/_ , which also provides an interface for the public data access .",
    "main - sequence stars with @xmath33 and @xmath34 are selected .",
    "the @xmath19 magnitude error is much larger than that of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , especially at the faint end . ]",
    "the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue-1 ) obtained spectra of nearly 230,000 unique stars over a range of spectral types to investigate galactic structure . building on this success",
    ", segue-2 spectroscopically observed around 119,000 unique stars , focusing on the stellar halo of the galaxy , including stars with distance from 10 to 60 kpc from the sun .",
    "we employ the complete set of derived stellar parameters for segue-1 and segue-2 from the newest version of segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity ( parameterized as [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "a thorough overview of segue effort can be found in @xcite .",
    "we use the adopted stellar atmospheric parameters from the sspp listed in the sppparams table . after excluding the repeated stars surveyed on different plates , we obtain a sample of 366,676 stars with sdss @xmath35 magnitudes , as well as stellar parameters .",
    "most stars in the sample have metallicities in the range @xmath36[fe / h]@xmath37 . in this study , in order to generate the [ fe / h ] probability distribution from the colors , we select main - sequence stars , adopting the following selection criteria :    * @xmath38 ; * @xmath33 ; * @xmath34 ; * main - sequence stars are selected by rejecting those objects at distances larger than @xmath39 mag from the stellar locus described by following equation @xcite : @xmath40   \\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * we further refine the selection of main - sequence stars by rejecting those objects at distances larger than @xmath41 mag from the stellar locus described by the following equation @xcite : @xmath42   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as an illustration , figure [ figure2 ] shows the two - color diagrams for @xmath21 versus @xmath17 and @xmath16 versus @xmath17 .",
    "our final sample includes 268,029 sample stars . throughout this paper",
    "it is understood that magnitude and color have been corrected for extinction and reddening following @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the spectrum - determined [ fe / h ] distribution of stars versus @xmath16 color .",
    "these stars are selected within small color ranges around @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the solid lines represent the photometric metallicity estimator derived by @xcite with @xmath17 color specified by 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 respectively . from inspection of this figure",
    ", these lines can only roughly describe the relation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath16 color . those stars with specified @xmath16 and @xmath17 colors exhibit a metallicity distribution which may result from several other factors .",
    "we build the metallicity probability distribution from the scattered points in each specified color bin , and then use a monte - carlo method to infer the mdf for large numbers of stars .",
    "that is to say , what we obtain from our photometric calibration is not a one - to - one function , but a probability - governed one - to - many function .",
    "the monte - carlo method relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results . as mentioned in the selection criteria ,",
    "the two colors we employ are confined to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we divided the @xmath16 vs. @xmath17 panel into @xmath46 mag@xmath47 bins , and designate each square unit by an index computed in the following manner : @xmath48 where the symbol @xmath49 stands for the integer portion .",
    "we obtain 384 square units . for a given sample of stars",
    ", we also divided the value of [ fe / h ] from -3.5 to 0.5 into 80 bins equally , with a bin width of 0.05 dex . in this manner , we obtained an array of index @xmath50 [ fe / h ] .",
    "each array element records the number of stars whose colors and [ fe / h ] match their corresponding positions , based on the above - selected sample of 268,029 stars .",
    "the resulting array , with its array elements holding the pertinent information , is called the `` seed '' array . each element of the seed array",
    "is denoted by @xmath51[i]$ ] , where @xmath30 ranges from 0 to 79 . the maximum of @xmath51[i]$ ] for @xmath30 in the range @xmath52 $ ] can easily be found , and is denoted by @xmath53 $ ] . from this seed array , we can evaluate the mdf for the photometrically - surveyed stars .",
    "for a certain index ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 interval ) , we use the monte - carlo method to generate a random number sequence whose probability distribution is determined by the [ fe / h ] distribution recorded in the seed array .",
    "suppose @xmath54 and @xmath55 are two stochastic variables which can be assigned a value by a random number generating function @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath56 is modulated to generate a uniform - probability distributed random integer number from 0 to 79 , and @xmath57 from 0 to @xmath53 $ ] . in each trial",
    ", we obtain a random number pair ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) . when @xmath60[x]$ ] , we record @xmath54 as a useful value , otherwise we discard it . by numerous trials ,",
    "we obtain a sequence of random numbers ` { ` @xmath61 ` } ` that follow the same probability distribution as those recorded in the seed array .",
    "then we can transform the obtained random number sequence into metallicities , [ fe / h ] , by [ fe / h]=@xmath62 . here , because @xmath51[i]$ ] can be equal to zero for some @xmath30 values , we can discard them and record the non - zero elements and their positions in a new array . through this trick , we greatly improve the sampling efficiency .    for a large number of photometrically - surveyed stars , we first count the number of stars that corresponds to each array element , and then , following the above procedure , obtain metallicities of the counted number for all array elements .",
    "the metallicities naturally form a distribution which we discuss below .",
    "to test the feasibility , and to show the superiority of the method described above , we make a comparison between this monte - carlo based method and the third - order polynomial - fitting method presented in @xcite , shown below : @xmath63=&-4.37 - 8.56x+15.5y+23.5x^2 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this distribution is fitted by a gaussian , with its mean zero - point offset and dispersion values labeled . ]",
    "we select main - sequence stars covering the color range @xmath0 from the spectroscopically - surveyed stars and evaluate their photometric metallicity distribution .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows the derived mdfs from the three different methods .",
    "the top three panels show the mdfs for stars with @xmath69 , and the bottom three panels with @xmath70 .",
    "the left panels present the spectrum - based mdf which can be regarded as `` ground truth '' .",
    "the middle panels show the photometric mdf determined by our monte - carlo method , and the right panels show the photometric mdf from @xcite s model .",
    "the peak values in all the histograms are normalized to one , with the actual peak values labeled . as shown in figure [ figure4 ] , the photometric mdfs based on our monte - carlo method much more closely resemble the spectroscopic mdfs than those obtained from the @xcite approach .",
    "not only are the peak values of the photometric mdfs determined by our monte - carlo method approximately equal to those of the spectrum - based mdf , but the wings of the two distributions have almost the same profile .",
    "by contrast , there exists some clear discrepancies between the photometric mdfs from @xcite s model and the spectrum - based mdfs , particularly at the very metal - rich and very metal - poor ends .",
    "we thus believe that polynomial - based fitting methods are clearly inferior , and should no longer be generally used . for application to a large number of stars ,",
    "there is great advantage in using the monte - carlo method for the derivation of photometric mdfs .",
    "note that if the number of stars used to evaluate the photometric mdfs is small , we can easily increase the number of desired random numbers @xmath54 using a multiplicative factor in the monte - carlo method .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] shows the distribution of metallicity residuals between the spectrum - based metallicity and that determined by the monte - carlo method for individual stars .",
    "we determine the metallicity of a single star from the peak value of the metallicity distribution in each specific color bin .",
    "the stars are selected covering the color range @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution is roughly a gaussian profile , with mean zero - point offset of @xmath71 dex and dispersion of @xmath72 dex .    in the conventional photometric metallicity calibration by polynomial fitting",
    ", the error mainly arises from two sources .",
    "one is from the fitting method itself ( illustrated in figure [ figure3 ] ) , and the other is from the errors in the color indexes . in sdss , the photometric error of the @xmath19-band magnitude is relatively large ( shown in figure [ figure1 ] ) , limiting the application range of the photometric metallicity estimator . in the monte - carlo calibration method",
    ", we suppose that the spectrum - based metallicity distribution in a given @xmath16 , @xmath17 color bin is fairly reliable , and thus , by reproducing its distribution we effectively eliminate the errors arising from the fitting method . the error introduced by fluctuations in the monte - carlo method can be eliminated by increasing the number of desired random numbers .",
    "in addition , the third - order polynomial model is determined by only 10 coefficients , while the model ( seed array ) construction involves many more variables .",
    "this , to some extent , guarantees the accuracy of photometric metallicity distribution determined by the monte - carlo method .",
    "the deviation of the photometric mdf determined by the monte - carlo method mainly arises from the errors in the color indexes , especially when estimating the mdfs for faint stars .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure4 ] , the calibration based on the monte - carlo method can be used to derive photometric mdfs with sufficient accuracy for most purposes .",
    "as an example , we use the method introduced in this study to derive the photometric mdf for stars as a function of distance from the galactic plane .",
    "the main - sequence stars with @xmath0 , @xmath1 kpc @xmath2 kpc , and in different @xmath3 intervals are selected ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 represent cylindrical galactocentric coordinates , with the sun s coordinate @xmath75(8 kpc , 0 , 0 ) ) . as shown in figure [ figure6 ]",
    ", the photometric mdfs in the top two panels can be well - fit by two gaussians , with peaks at about @xmath76 and @xmath9 respectively , one associated with the disk system , and the other with the halo ( and metal - weak disk ) .",
    "the mdfs in the two bottom panels are found to be better - fit by three gaussians , with peaks at about @xmath76 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the two lower peaks may be associated with inner - halo and outer - halo populations , respectively @xcite .",
    "these four histograms clearly show that the number ratio between disk stars and halo stars decreases with vertical distance from the galactic plane . in the metal - rich and metal - poor ends ,",
    "the number of stars decrease gradually .",
    "the number ratios as a function of @xmath3 between the disk and halo above the galactic plane could be recalculated from the photometric metallicity distribution , and the result can be compared with that from the method of star counting .",
    "this will be presented in our future papers .",
    "this paper presents a new method to estimate the photometric mdf for main - sequence stars .",
    "the method is tested using a spectroscopic sample of stars from the sdss .",
