    "the general study of _ real - world _ networks has seen a tremendous growth in the last few years .",
    "this growth occurred both at an empirical level of obtaining data on networks such as the internet , transportation networks , such as rail and road networks , and biochemical networks , such as gene regulatory networks , as well as at a theoretical level in the understanding of the properties of various mathematical models for these networks .",
    "we are interested in one specific theoretical aspect of the above vast and expanding field .",
    "the setting is as follows : consider a transportation network whose main aim is to transport flow between various vertices in the network via the available edges . at the very basic level",
    "there are two crucial elements which affect the flow carrying capabilities and delays experienced by vertices in the network :    the actual graph topology , such as the density of edges and existence of short paths between vertices in the graph distance . in this context",
    "there has been an enormous amount of interest in the concept of _ small - world _ networks where the typical graph distance between vertices in the network is of order @xmath11 or even smaller .",
    "indeed , for many of the mathematical models used to model real - world transmission networks , such as the internet , the graph distance can be of order much smaller than order @xmath11 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , where for the configuration model with degree exponent @xmath4 , the remarkable result that the graph distance between typical vertices is of order @xmath13 is proved . in this case",
    ", we say that the graph is _ ultra small _ , a phrase invented in @xcite .",
    "similar results have appeared for related models in @xcite .",
    "the configuration model is described in more detail in section  [ not ] . for introductions",
    "to scale - free random graphs , we refer to the monographs @xcite , for surveys of classical random graphs focussing on the erds  rnyi random graph ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second factor which plays a crucial role is the edge weight or cost structure of the graph which can be thought of as representing actual economic costs or congestion costs across edges .",
    "edge weights being identically equal to @xmath14 gives us back the graph geometry .",
    "what can be said when the edge costs have some other behavior ?",
    "the main aim of this study is to understand what happens when each edge is given an independent edge cost with mean @xmath14 . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that the distribution of edge costs is exponentially with mean @xmath14 @xmath15 $ ] , leading to first passage percolation on the graph involved .",
    "first passage percolation with exponential weights has received substantial attention ( see @xcite ) , in particular on the complete graph , and , more recently , also on erds  rnyi random graphs .",
    "however , particularly the relation to the scale - free nature of the underlying random graph and the behavior of first passage percolation on it has not yet been investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we envisage a situation where the edge weights represent actual economic costs , so that all flow is routed through minimal weight paths .",
    "the actual time delay experienced by vertices in the network is given by the number of edges on this least cost path or hopcount @xmath16 .",
    "thus , for two typical vertices @xmath14 and @xmath17 in the network , it is important to understand both the minimum weight @xmath18 of transporting flow between two vertices as well as the hopcount @xmath16 or the number of edges on this minimal weight path .",
    "what we shall see is the following universal behavior :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ even if the graph topology is of ultra - small nature , the addition of random edge weights causes a complete change in the geometry and , in particular , the number of edges on the minimal weight path between two vertices increases to @xmath19 . _",

    "we shall see that a remarkably universal picture emerges , in the sense that for each @xmath0 , the hopcount satisfies a central limit theorem ( clt ) with asymptotically equal mean and variance equal to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 for @xmath4 , while @xmath7 for @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is the only feature which is left from the randomness of the underlying random graph , and @xmath24 is a simple function of  @xmath25 for @xmath4 , and of the average forward degree for @xmath3 .",
    "this type of universality is reminiscent of that of simple random walk , which , appropriately scaled , converges to brownian motion , and the parameters needed for the brownian limit are only the mean and variance of the step - size .",
    "interestingly , for the internet hopcount , measurements show that the hopcount is close to a normal distribution with equal mean and variance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and it would be of interest to investigate whether first passage percolation on a random graph can be used as a model for the internet hopcount .",

    ", we rigorously analyze the case of the configuration model with degree exponent @xmath26 , the conceptually important case in practice , since the degree exponent of a wide variety of real - world networks is conjectured to be in this interval . in @xcite , we investigate the case @xmath12 , where the first moment of the degrees is infinite and we observe entirely different behavior of the hopcount @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in constructing a random graph on @xmath8 vertices . given a _ degree sequence _",
    ", namely a sequence of @xmath8 positive integers @xmath27 with @xmath28 assumed to be even , the configuration model ( cm ) on @xmath8 vertices with degree sequence @xmath29 is constructed as follows :    start with @xmath8 vertices and @xmath30 stubs or half - edges adjacent to vertex @xmath31 .",
    "the graph is constructed by randomly pairing each stub to some other stub to form edges .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the total degree .",
    "number the stubs from @xmath14 to @xmath33 in some arbitrary order .",
    "then , at each step , two stubs which are not already paired are chosen uniformly at random among all the unpaired or _",
    "free _ stubs and are paired to form a single edge in the graph .",
    "these stubs are no longer free and removed from the list of free stubs .",
    "we continue with this procedure of choosing and pairing two stubs until all the stubs are paired .",
    "observe that the order in which we choose the stubs does not matter .",
    "although self - loops may occur , these become rare as @xmath34 ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite for more precise results in this direction ) .",
    "above , we have described the construction of the cm when the degree sequence is given . here",
    "we shall specify how we construct the actual degree sequence @xmath29 which shall be _",
    "random_. in general , we shall let a capital letter ( such as @xmath35 ) denote a random variable , while a lower case letter ( such as @xmath30 ) denote a deterministic object .",
    "we shall assume that the random variables @xmath36 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with a certain distribution function @xmath37 .",
    "( when the sum of stubs @xmath38 is not even then we shall use the degree sequence @xmath39 , with @xmath40 replaced by @xmath41 . this does not effect our calculations . )",
    "we shall assume that the degrees of all vertices are at least @xmath17 and that the degree distribution @xmath37 is regularly varying .",
    "more precisely , we assume @xmath42 with @xmath0 , and where @xmath43 is a slowly varying function for @xmath44 . in the case",
    "@xmath3 , we shall replace  ( [ fcond ] ) by the less stringent condition  ( [ distribution>3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , each edge is given a random edge weight , which in this study will always be assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) exponential random variables with mean 1 .",
    "because in our setting the vertices are exchangeable , we let  @xmath14 and @xmath17 be the two random vertices picked _ uniformly at random _ in the network .    as stated earlier , the parameter @xmath25 is assumed to satisfy @xmath0 , so that the degree distribution has finite mean . in some cases , we shall distinguish between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; in the former case , the variance of the degrees is finite , while in the latter , it is infinite .",
    "it follows from the condition @xmath45 , almost surely , that the probability that the vertices 1 and 2 are connected converges to 1 .",

    "in this section , we state the main results for @xmath0 .",

    "the case where @xmath12 is deferred to @xcite .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we shall denote by @xmath53 the number of edges and total weight of the shortest - weight path between vertices  1 and 2 in the cm with i.i.d.degrees with distribution function @xmath37 , where we condition the vertices 1 and 2 to be connected , and we assume that each edge in the cm has an i.i.d . exponential weight with mean 1 .      in this section",

    "the condition @xmath60 is equivalent to the existence of a _ giant component _ in the cm , the size of which is proportional to @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; for the most recent and general result , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the proportionality constant is the survival probability of the branching process with offspring distribution @xmath61 . as a consequence of the conditions on the distribution function @xmath37 , in our case",

    "when this is the case , the variance of the degrees is infinite , while the mean degree is finite . as a result , we have that @xmath74 in  ( [ nu - def ] ) equals @xmath75 , so that the cm is always supercritical ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath4 , we shall make a stronger assumption on @xmath37 than  ( [ fcond ] ) , namely , that there exists a @xmath4 and @xmath76 such that , for all @xmath77 , @xmath78    [ main(2,3 ) ] let the degree distribution @xmath37 of the cm on @xmath8 vertices be nondegenerate , satisfy @xmath54 and satisfy   for some @xmath4 .",

    "edge weights is not very realistic ; however , it allows us to almost completely analyze the minimum weight path .",
    "the assumption of exponentially distributed edge weights is probably not necessary @xcite but helps in considerably simplifying the analysis .",
    "interestingly , hopcounts which are close to normal with asymptotically equal means and variances are observed in internet ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results presented here might shed some light on the origin of this observation .      comparing theorems  [ main>3 ] and  [ main(2,3 ) ]",
    "we see that a remarkably universal picture emerges .",
    "indeed , the hopcount _ in both cases _ satisfies a clt with equal mean and variance proportional to @xmath11 , and the proportionality constant @xmath24 satisfies @xmath6 for @xmath4 , while @xmath7 for @xmath3 .",
    "we shall see that the proofs of theorems  [ main>3 ] and  [ main(2,3 ) ] run , to a large extent , parallel , and we shall only need to distinguish when dealing with the related branching process problem to which the neighborhoods can be coupled .      in @xcite , we study first passage percolation on the cm when @xmath12 , that is , the degrees have infinite mean .",
    "we show that a remarkably different picture emerges , in the sense that @xmath16 remains uniformly bounded and converges in distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that we can think of the cm , when @xmath12 , as a union of an ( essentially ) finite number of stars . together with the results in theorems  [ main>3][main(2,3 ) ] , we see that only the critical cases @xmath84 and @xmath85 remain open .",
    "we conjecture that the clt , with asymptotically equal means and variances , remains valid when @xmath85 , but that the proportionality constant @xmath24 can take any value in @xmath86 , depending on , for example , whether @xmath74 in  ( [ nu - def ] ) is finite or not .",
    "what happens for @xmath84 is less clear to  us .",
    "expanding neighborhood techniques for random graphs have been used extensively to explore shortest path structures and other properties of locally tree - like graphs .",
    "see the closely related papers @xcite where an extensive study of the cm has been carried out .",
    "relevant to our context is @xcite , corollary 1.4(i ) , where it has been shown that when @xmath87 , the graph distance @xmath88 between two typical vertices , which are conditioned to be connected , satisfies the asymptotics @xmath89 as @xmath34 , and furthermore that the fluctuations of @xmath90 remain uniformly bounded as @xmath91 . for @xmath3",
    ", it is shown in @xcite , corollary 1.3(i ) , and that @xmath92 has bounded fluctuations @xmath93 again with bounded fluctuations . comparing these results with theorems  [ main>3][main(2,3 ) ] , we see the drastic effect that the addition of edge weights has on the geometry of the graph .      in this paper , as in @xcite , we assume that the degrees are i.i.d . with a certain degree distribution function @xmath37 . in the literature , also",
    "the setting where the degrees @xmath94 are deterministic , and converge in an appropriate sense to an asymptotic degree distribution is studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that our results can be adapted to this situation .",
    "also , we assume that the degrees are at least 2 a.s .",
    ", which ensures that two uniform vertices lie , with high probability ( w.h.p . ) in the giant component .",
    "we have chosen for this setting to keep the proofs as simple as possible , and we conjecture that theorems  [ main>3][main(2,3 ) ] , when instead we condition the vertices  1 and  2 to be connected , remain true verbatim in the more general case of the supercritical cm .",
    "the problem studied in this paper , first passage percolation on a random graph , fits in the more general framework of stochastic processes in random environments , such as random walk in random environment . in such problems ,",
    "there are two interesting settings , namely , when we study results when averaging out over the environment and when we freeze the environment ( the so - called annealed and quenched asymptotics ) . in this paper , we study the _ annealed _ setting , and it would be of interest to extend our results to the _ quenched _ setting , that is , study the first - passage percolation problem _ conditionally on the random graph_. we expect the results to change in this case , primarily due to the fact that we know the exact neighborhood of each point .",
    "however , when we consider the shortest - weight problem between two _ uniform _ vertices , we conjecture theorems  [ main>3][main(2,3 ) ] to remain valid verbatim , due to the fact that the neighborhoods of uniform vertices converge to the same limit as in the annealed setting ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph @xmath95 is obtained by taking the vertex set @xmath96=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] and letting each edge @xmath97 be present , independently of all other edges , with probability @xmath98 .",
    "the study closest in spirit to our study is @xcite where similar ideas were explored for dense erds  rnyi random graphs .",
    "the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph @xmath95 can be viewed as a close brother of the cm , with poisson degrees , hence with @xmath2 .",
    "consider the case where @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in a future paper",
    "we plan to show , parallel to the above analysis , that @xmath16 satisfies a clt with asymptotically equal mean and variance given by @xmath101 .",
    "this connects up nicely with @xcite where related results were shown for @xmath102 and @xmath103 was proved to converge to 1 in probability .",
    "see also @xcite where related statements were proved under stronger assumptions on @xmath104 .",
    "interestingly , in a recent paper , ding et al .",
    "@xcite use first passage percolation to study the diameter of the largest component of the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph with edge probability @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "it would be of interest to study the effect of weights even further , for example , by studying the case where the weights are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with distribution equal to @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an exponential random variable with mean 1 and @xmath110 .",
    "the case @xmath111 corresponds to the graph distance  @xmath112 as studied in @xcite while the case @xmath113 corresponds to the case with i.i.d .",
    "exponential weights as studied here .",
    "even the problem on the complete graph seems to be open in this case , and we intend to return to this problem in a future paper .",
    "we conjecture that the clt remains valid for first passage perolation on the cm when the weights are given by independent copies of @xmath114 with asymptotic mean and variance proportional to @xmath11 , but , when @xmath115 , we predict that the asymptotic means and variances have _ different _ constants .",
    "we became interested in random graphs with edge weights from @xcite where , via empirical simulations , a wide variety of behavior was predicted for the shortest - weight paths in various random graph models .",
    "the setup that we analyze is the _ weak disorder _ case . in @xcite ,",
    "also a number of interesting conjectures regarding the _ strong disorder case _ were made , which would correspond to analyzing the minimal spanning tree of these random graph models , and which is a highly interesting problem .",
    "first passage percolation , especially on the integer lattice , has been extensively studied in the last fifty years ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the more recent survey @xcite ) . in these papers",
    ", of course , the emphasis is completely different , in the sense that geometry plays an intrinsic role and often the goal of the study is to show that there is a limiting `` shape '' to first passage percolation from the origin .",
    "janson @xcite studies first passage percolation on the complete graph with exponential weights .",
    "his main results are @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the weight of the shortest path between the vertices @xmath31 and  @xmath118 .",
    "recently the authors of @xcite showed in the same set - up that @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the unique solution of the equation @xmath121 .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate such questions in the cm with exponential weights .",
    "the fundamental difference of first passage percolation on the integer lattice , or even on the complete graph , is that in our case the underlying graph is random as well , and we are lead to the delicate relation between the randomness of the graph together with that of the stochastic process , in this case first passage percolation , living on it .",
    "finally , for a slightly different perspective to shortest weight problems , see @xcite where relations between the random assignment problem and the shortest - weight problem with exponential edge weights on the complete graph are explored .",
    "the key idea of the proof is to first grow the shortest - weight graph ( swg ) from vertex 1 , until it reaches an appropriate size . after this",
    ", we grow the swg from vertex 2 until it connects up with the swg from vertex 1 .",
    "the size to which we let the swg from  1 grow shall be the same as the _ typical size _ at which the connection between the swg from vertices 1 and 2 shall be made .",
    "however , the connection time at which the swg from vertex 2 connects to the swg from vertex 1 is _",
    "random_.    more precisely , we define the swg from vertex 1 , denoted by @xmath122 , recursively .",
    "the growth of the swg from vertex 2 , which is denoted by @xmath123 , is similar .",
    "we start with vertex 1 by defining @xmath124 .",
    "then we add the edge and vertex with minimal edge weight connecting vertex @xmath14 to one of its neighbors ( or itself when the minimal edge is a self - loop ) .",
    "this defines @xmath125 .",
    "we obtain @xmath126 from @xmath127 by adding the edge and end vertex connected to the @xmath127 with minimal edge weight .",
    "we informally let @xmath128 denote the swg from vertex @xmath129 when @xmath130 edges ( and vertices ) have been added to it .",
    "this definition is _ informal _ , as we shall need to deal with self - loops and cycles in a proper way .",
    "how we do this is explained in more detail in section  [ sec - coupling ] . as mentioned before , we first grow @xmath131 to a size @xmath132 , which is to be chosen appropriately . after this , we grow @xmath133 , and we stop as soon as a vertex of @xmath134 appears in @xmath135 , as then the shortest - weight path between vertices 1 and 2 has been found . indeed ,",
    "if on the contrary , the shortest weight path between vertex 1 and vertex 2 contains an edge not contained in the union of the two swgs when they meet , then necessarily this edge would have been chosen in one of the two swgs at an earlier stage , since at some earlier stage this edge must have been incident to one of the swgs and had the minimal weight of all edges incident to that swg . in sections  [ sec - coupling ] and  [ sec - two_flows ] , we shall make these definitions precise .",
    "denote this first common vertex by @xmath136 , and let @xmath137 be the distance between vertex  @xmath31 and @xmath136 , that is , the number of edges on the minimum weight path from @xmath31 to @xmath136 .",
    "then we have that @xmath138 while , denoting by @xmath139 the weight of the shortest - weight paths from @xmath31 to @xmath136 , we have @xmath140 thus , to understand the random variables @xmath16 and @xmath18 , it is paramount to understand the random variables @xmath139 and @xmath137 , for @xmath141 .",
    "since , for @xmath34 , the topologies of the neighborhoods of vertices 1 and 2 are close to being independent , it seems likely that @xmath142 and @xmath143 , as well as @xmath144 and @xmath145 are close to independent . since , further , the cm is locally tree - like , we are lead to the study of the problem on a tree .    with the above in mind , the paper is organized as follows :    in section  [ sec - flow_tree ] we study the flow on a tree .",

    "degrees with offspring distribution @xmath146 in  ( [ eqn : size - bias ] ) . clearly , the cm _ has _ cycles and self - loops , and thus sometimes deviates from the tree description . in section  [ sec - coupling ] , we reformulate the problem of the growth of the swg from a fixed vertex as a problem of the swg on a tree , where we find a way to deal with cycles by a coupling argument , so that the arguments in section  [ sec - flow_tree ] apply quite literally . in proposition",

    "the main difference between the flow on a graph and on a tree is that on the tree there are no cycles , while on a graph there are .",

    "we let @xmath198 consist only of the alive vertex 1 , and we let @xmath199 .",
    "we next let @xmath200 consist of the @xmath201 allowed stubs and of the explored vertex 1 , and we let @xmath202 denote the number of allowed stubs . in the sequel of the construction ,",

    "we note that @xmath211 , indeed , @xmath212 then , we can construct @xmath203 from @xmath204 as follows .",
    "we choose one of the @xmath213 allowed stubs uniformly at random , and then , if the stub is not artificial , pair it uniformly at random to a free stub unequal to itself .",
    "below , we shall consistently call these two stubs the _ chosen _ stub and the _ paired _ stub , respectively .",
    "there are 3 possibilities , depending on what kind of stub we choose and what kind of stub it is paired to :    [ const - swgcm ]  the chosen stub is real , that is , not artificial , and the paired stub is not one of the allowed stubs . in this case , which shall be most likely at the start of the growth procedure of the swg , the paired stub is incident to a vertex outside @xmath204 , we denote by @xmath214 the forward degree of the vertex incident to the paired stub ( i.e. , its degree minus 1 ) and we define @xmath215 . then we remove the paired and the chosen stub from @xmath216 and add the @xmath214 stubs incident to the vertex incident to the paired stub to @xmath216 to obtain @xmath217 , we remove the chosen and the paired stubs from @xmath218 to obtain @xmath208 , and @xmath219 .",
    "the chosen stub is real and the paired stub is an allowed stub . in this case , the paired stub is incident to a vertex in @xmath204 , and we have created a cycle . in this case , we create an artificial stub replacing the paired stub and denote @xmath220 . then we let @xmath221 , remove both the chosen and paired stubs from @xmath216 and add the artificial stub to obtain @xmath217 , and remove the chosen and paired stub from @xmath218 to obtain @xmath208 , while @xmath222 is @xmath223 together with the newly created artificial stub . in @xmath203 , we also add an artificial edge to an artificial vertex in the place where the chosen stub was , the forward degree of the artificial vertex being  0 .",
    "this is done because a vertex is added each time in the construction on a tree .",
    "the chosen stub is artificial . in this case , we let @xmath220 , @xmath221 and remove the chosen stub from @xmath216 and @xmath223 to obtain @xmath205 and @xmath210 , while @xmath224 .    in construction  [ const - swgcm ]",
    ", we always work on a tree since we replace an edge which creates a cycle , by one artificial stub , to replace the paired stub , and an artificial edge plus an artificial vertex in the @xmath203 with degree 0 , to replace the chosen stub .",
    "note that the number of allowed edges at time @xmath130 satisfies @xmath215 , where @xmath225 and , for @xmath226 , in cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , @xmath220 , while in case ( 1 ) ( which we expect to occur in most cases ) , the distribution of @xmath214 is equal to the forward degree of a vertex incident to a uniformly chosen stub . here , the choice of stubs is without replacement .",
    "the reason for replacing cycles as described above is that we wish to represent the swg problem as a problem on a tree , as we now will explain informally . on a tree with degrees @xmath148 , as in section  [ sec - flow_tree ] , we have that the remaining degree of vertex @xmath31 at time @xmath130 is precisely equal to @xmath30 minus the number of neighbors that are among the @xmath130 vertices with minimal shortest - weight paths from the root . for first passage percolation on a graph with cycles ,",
    "a cycle does not only remove one of the edges of the vertex incident to it ( as on the tree ) , but also one edge of the vertex at the other end of the cycle .",
    "thus this is a _ different _ problem , and the results from section  [ sec - flow_tree ] do not apply literally . by adding the artificial stub , edge and vertex , we artificially keep the degree of the receiving vertex the same , so that we _ do _ have the same situation as on a tree , and we can use the results in section  [ sec - flow_tree ] . however , we do need to investigate the relation between the problem with the artificial stubs and the original swg problem on the cm .",
    "that is the content of the next proposition .    in its statement",
    ", we shall define the @xmath130th closest vertex to vertex 1 in the cm , with i.i.d .",
    "exponential weights , as the unique vertex of which the minimal weight path is the @xmath130th smallest among all @xmath227 vertices .",
    "further , at each time @xmath130 , we denote by _ artificial vertices _ those vertices which are artificially created , and we call the other vertices _ real vertices_. then we let the random time @xmath228 be the first time @xmath118 that @xmath229 consists of @xmath163 real vertices , that is , @xmath230 the @xmath231 originates from the fact that at time @xmath232 , @xmath233 consists if 1 real vertex , namely , the vertex from which we construct the swg .",
    "thus , in the above set up , we have that @xmath234 precisely when no cycle has been created in the construction up to time @xmath130 .",
    "then our main coupling result is as follows :    [ prop - coupling ] jointly for all @xmath155 , the set of real vertices in @xmath235 is equal in distribution to the set of @xmath31th closest vertices to vertex 1 , for @xmath236 .",
    "consequently :    the generation of the @xmath130th closest vertex to vertex 1 has distribution @xmath237 where @xmath176 is defined in   with @xmath238 and @xmath239 as described in construction  [ const - swgcm ] ;    the weight of the shortest weight path to the @xmath130th closest vertex to vertex 1 has distribution @xmath240 , where @xmath179 is defined in   with @xmath238 and @xmath241 as described in construction  .",
    "we shall make use of the nice property that the sequence @xmath242 , which consists of the forward degrees of chosen stubs that are paired to stubs which are not in the swg , is , for the cm , an exchangeable sequence of random variables ( see lemma  [ lem - exchange ] below ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that a free stub is chosen uniformly at random , and the order of the choices does not matter .",
    "this exchangeability shall prove to be useful in order to investigate shortest - weight paths in the cm .",
    "we now prove proposition  [ prop - coupling ] .",
    "proof of proposition  [ prop - coupling ] in growing the swg , we give exponential weights to the set @xmath243 . after pairing ,",
    "we identify the exponential weight of the chosen stub to the exponential weight of the edge which it is part of . we note that by the memoryless property of the exponential random variable , each stub is chosen uniformly at random from all the allowed stubs incident to the swg at the given time .",
    "further , by the construction of the cm in section  [ not ] , this stub is paired uniformly at random to one of the available free stubs .",
    "thus the growth rules of the swg in construction  [ const - swgcm ] equal those in the above description of @xmath244 , unless a cycle is closed and an artificial stub , edge and vertex are created . in this case , the artificial stub , edge and vertex might influence the law of the swg .",
    "however , we note that the artificial vertices are not being counted in the set of real vertices , and since artificial vertices have forward degree @xmath149 , they will not be a part of any shortest path to a real vertex .",
    "thus the artificial vertex at the end of the artificial edge does not affect the law of the swg .",
    "artificial stubs that are created to replace paired stubs when a cycle is formed , and which are not yet removed at time @xmath130 , will be called _ dangling ends_. now ,",
    "if we only consider real vertices , then the distribution of weights and lengths of the shortest - weight paths between the starting points and those real vertices are identical .",
    "indeed , we can decorate any graph with as many dangling ends as we like without changing the shortest - weight paths to real vertices in the graph .",
    "now that the flow problem on the cm has been translated into a flow problem on a related tree of which we have explicitly described its distribution , we may make use of proposition  [ prop : gen ] which shall allow us to extend proposition  [ lemma : clt - sum1 ] to the setting of the cm .",
    "note that , among others , due to the fact that when we draw an artificial stub , the degrees are not i.i.d .",
    "( and not even exchangeable since the probability of drawing an artificial stub is likely to increase in time ) , we need to extend proposition  [ lemma : clt - sum1 ] to a setting where the degrees are weakly dependent . in the statement of the result , we recall that @xmath176 is the height of the @xmath130th added vertex in the tree problem above . in the statement below , we write @xmath245 where , for @xmath246 , we write @xmath247 .    before we formulate the clt for the hopcount of the shortest - weight graph in the cm , we repeat once more the setup of the random variables involved .",
    "let @xmath199 , @xmath248 , and for @xmath249 , @xmath250 where , in case the chosen stub is real , that is , not artificial , and the paired stub is not one of the allowed stubs , @xmath173 equals the forward degree of the vertex incident to the @xmath31th paired stub , whereas @xmath251 otherwise .",
    "finally , we recall that , conditionally on @xmath252 , @xmath253\\\\[-8pt ] { \\mathbb{p}}(i_1=1)&=&1,\\qquad { \\mathbb{p}}(i_j=1)=b_j / s_j,\\qquad2 \\leq j \\leq m.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ lemma : clt - sum2 ] let the law of @xmath176 be given in .",

    "we shall discuss the moment when they connect in section  [ sec - connedge ] below .",
