    "the x - ray emission from elliptical galaxies directly tells us physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , such as total mass , thermal energy , and chemical composition . also , the number of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) gives us a clue how actively supernova explosions have occurred in the past .",
    "systematic relation between the x - ray and the optical blue - band luminosities , called the @xmath0 relation , was found with the _ einstein _ observatory @xcite and has been used to study the origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "the hard component above @xmath1 kev mainly comes from the lmxbs , and its luminosity is almost proportional to the optical one",
    ". the softer ism component ( @xmath2 kev ) shows a large scatter in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "@xcite analyzed pspc data of 52 early - type galaxies and found that the galaxies are categorized into two groups , one is an x - ray luminous group ( @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ) characterized by extended hot halos with a radius of a few times 10@xmath5 , and the other is an x - ray faint group showing compact halos .",
    "as shown clearly in the case of ngc 4636 @xcite , a large part of the emission in the x - ray luminous galaxies comes from an extended ( @xmath6 kpc ) hot ism , indicating that they have extended potential wells around the galaxies with a scale as large as groups of galaxies .    in many cluster of galaxies ,",
    "the central regions exhibit strong x - ray emission from low temperature ( @xmath7 kev ) gases , which have been interpreted either due to cooling flows or to ism in central cd galaxies .",
    "the recent results for the cooling flow phenomena from _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ indicated that the simple cooling - flow picture does not hold in a straightforward manner , and that some heating sources must be working in the center @xcite .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "study of the perseus cluster @xcite revealed extended ( @xmath8 kpc ) cool emission in the center , suggesting a potential structure larger than that of the cd galaxy ngc 1275 .",
    "the excess central emission of the centaurus cluster shows that the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is not isothermal but requires at least a two - phase gas @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray surface brightness profile around ngc 1399 in the fornax cluster had three components , i.e.   cooling flow region , galactic and cluster halos .",
    "the formation process of these hierarchical potential structures around a galaxy or at the center of a cluster of galaxies is not yet understood .",
    "interaction between the ism and the icm may cause a significant effect on the galaxy evolution .",
    "elliptical galaxies in the regions of high galaxy density tend to be x - ray faint @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the elliptical galaxies ngc 4874 and ngc 4879 in the center of the coma cluster and found that the sizes of the ism are as small as 3 kpc . the good spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ observatory enables us to look into the interaction process around bright galaxies in a number of clusters of galaxies .",
    "a1060 ( hydra i cluster , @xmath9 ) is an x - ray bright cluster of galaxies and is considered to be the archetype relaxed system .",
    "the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ observations of the cluster @xcite showed that the temperature of the icm is constant at @xmath10 kev with the x - ray luminosity @xmath11 erg s@xmath4 in the 210 kev band .",

    "the x - ray morphology of the cluster is symmetric , and the surface brightness profile is approximated by a single @xmath14 model or a modified `` universal '' nfw model @xcite .",

    "an e3 galaxy ngc 3309 with @xmath16 lies at only @xmath17 ( 22 kpc in projection ) away from ngc 3311 , i.e.  within the core radius of the cluster ( @xmath18 ) obtained by the @xmath14 model fit for the pspc surface brightness @xcite .",
    "the redshifts of the two galaxies correspond to 3593 km s@xmath4 for ngc 3311 and 4075 km s@xmath4 for ngc 3309 , respectively @xcite . assuming that ngc 3311 is settled at the center of the cluster potential as the cd galaxy",
    ", the velocity of ngc 3309 in the icm would be at least 500 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the apparently smooth and isothermal icm and the presence of two giant galaxies makes this system a suitable object for the study of interaction features between galaxies and the icm .",
    "we use @xmath19 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 and @xmath20 , where the luminosity distance to a1060 is 46 mpc and an angular size of @xmath21 corresponds to 0.217 kpc .",

    "the observational mode was very faint ( vf ) using 5 ccd chips ( i0123 , s2 ) , and the center of the cluster was focused on acis - i3 .",

    "chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) , using the ciao v2.1 package and calibration products caldb v2.8 . during the observation ,",
    "the count rate of acis - i3 was stable at @xmath23 ( rms ) count s@xmath4 when averaged in a 161 s interval , except for a gradual increase by 20% in the last 1.2 ks of the whole observation .",

    "the peak near the center of the image corresponds to the cd galaxy ngc 3311 , and another peak at @xmath29 west is ngc 3309 .",
    "these peaks are clearly extended as compared with the combined response for hrma ( with 50% encircled energy diameter of @xmath30 ) @xcite and acis ( @xmath31 ) , suggesting that the emission comes from the ism of the galaxies .    in the first place",
    ", we examined the radial profile of the surface brightness .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : icm_radial ] shows the profiles in the energy band 0.5  1.5 kev and 1.5  5.0 kev , which include both the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and the non x - ray background ( nxb ) .",
    "the center location is asigned to ngc 3311 and the profile covers a radius of @xmath32 , excluding the region with a radius of @xmath33 centered on ngc 3309 .",
    "the radial profiles broadly consist of two components , namely a narrow emission centered on ngc 3311 , likely to be the ism in the galaxy , and an extended icm component in a1060 .",
    "such a double - component structure is similar to those seen in the fornax and centaurus clusters @xcite , which could be empirically fitted with double-@xmath14 models .",
    "we tried to fit the profile in 0.5  1.5 kev with a double-@xmath14 model , which turned out to be acceptable .",
    "the obtained parameters are listed in the first and second rows of table  [ tab : beta ] .",
    "looking at only the extended icm component , the @xmath34 and the core radius ( @xmath35 ) indicate that the emission profile is very different from the previous pspc result characterized by @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we should note , however , that the size of the acis chip ( @xmath38 ) is comparable to the core diameter and may not well trace the large icm structure .",
    "this may be the cause of flatter ( small @xmath14 ) profile with",
    "_ chandra_. on the other hand , the pspc data are unable to resolve the emission of ngc 3311 , and it could well be the reason for giving the steeper icm structure .",
    "we will deal in the cluster - scale structures of a1060 in a separate paper ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of the icm emission was examined by taking the data in an annulus with @xmath39 excluding the ngc 3309 region , and is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : icm_radial ] . the background spectrum including the cxb and nxb is subtracted based on the blank sky data prepared by maxim markevitch ( http://asc.harvard.edu/cal/ ) . the icm flux is more than 10 times higher than the sum of cxb and nxb below 5 kev .",
    "the spectral fit was performed with the xspec v10.0 package . for the energy response",
    ", we use a point source response ( arf ) for the ngc 3311 as a substitution to the one for the diffuse emission .",
    "when the energy range is limited to 2.08.0 kev , the spectral fit of the acis spectrum gives the temperature @xmath40 kev with @xmath41 , showing a good agreement with the previous _ asca _ and _ rosat _ results , i.e.  a mekal thermal model with @xmath42 kev and metal abundance of 0.3 solar absorbed by the galactic column density of @xmath43 @xmath2410@xmath44 cm@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this suggest that the isothermal icm is filling up a large volume in a1060 , from the outer region to the very inner region within @xmath45 ( 20 kpc ) .",
    "the histogram in the right panel of figure  [ fig : icm_radial ] shows the best - fit model by @xcite compared with the acis spectrum . between 2 and 8 kev , the @xmath46 for this model .",
    "however , in the lower energy range down to 0.5 kev with the same spectral parameters , the data points all lie under the model with the deviation by as much as a factor of 2 , and the @xmath47 value in this energy range is @xmath48 .",
    "if we fit the spectrum by adjusting the hydrogen column density as a free parameter , the best fit value becomes 1.7@xmath2410@xmath49 cm@xmath27 .",
    "however , we are certain from the pspc spectrum @xcite that there is no significant absorption in excess of the galactic @xmath50 ( 6 @xmath2410@xmath44 cm@xmath27 ) .",
    "the flux difference between the model and the data in 0.51 kev is 4@xmath2410@xmath51 erg cm@xmath27 s@xmath4 which is about 5 times larger than those of the central two galaxies as shown later .",
    "therefore , contamination of the galaxy component in the asca data can not explain the spectral difference .",
    "we compare the energy spectra of pspc , gis and acis from the same radius of 98  , including the galaxies ngc 3311 and ngc 3311 , and the descrepancy at the low energy band still exists .",
    "the degradation in the detection efficiency of the acis below 1 kev has been recently reported ( http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/links/acis/acis/cal_projects/index.html ) , then this deficiency of the soft x - ray flux in the _ chandra _ data could be caused by this phenomena .",
    "the x - ray image including the two central galaxies was compared with an optical image from digitized sky survey ( dss ) for the central @xmath52 region , as shown in figure  [ fig : x_opt_image ] .",
    "the x - ray extents of the two galaxies ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 are much smaller than those in the optical band .",
    "this feature is quite similar to the recent results for the two galaxies in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "the detailed radial profiles will be analyzed in the next section .    in this section , energy spectra of the central two galaxies , ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 ,",
    "are examined .",
    "the x - ray data in circular regions with radii @xmath53 and @xmath54 centered on the respective galaxies were cut out , as indicated with solid circles in figure  [ fig : x_opt_image ] .",
    "these radii correspond to @xmath55 for ngc 3311 and @xmath56 for ngc 3309 , respectively @xcite . for the common background",
    ", we took data from a circular region with @xmath57 radius in the cluster center , excluding the two galaxies .",
    "the resultant background spectrum is the same as that already shown in figure  [ fig : icm_radial ] .",
    "normalization of this background spectrum , which includes nxb and cxb , was then scaled to match the surface brightness of the icm at the target positions based on the radial profile fits in the next section . since the background spectrum is dominated by the icm emission , the wrong scalings for the nxb and cxb intensitis cause an influence which is less than 1% of the total background flux .",
    "the background subtracted spectra of the two galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "spectral fits were also carried out for the data of two galaxies with xspec v.10.0 . as for the model spectra",
    ", the mekal model was used for the ism component and a zbrems model , representing a redshifted thermal bremsstrahlung emission , was applied for the lmxb component , respectively .",
    "the temperature of the zbrems model was fixed to @xmath58 kev , as an empirical approximation of the x - ray spectra of lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the absorption and metal abundance in the mekal model were not effectively constrained .",
    "we , therefore , fixed the absorption column to the galactic value of 6 @xmath2410@xmath44 cm@xmath27 and the metal abundance to 0.5 solar , respectively .",
    "the resultant parameters of the spectral fits are listed in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "the ism temperatures are @xmath59 kev and @xmath60 kev for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 , respectively .",
    "the sum of the ism fluxes for the two galaxies is ( @xmath61 ) @xmath2410@xmath62 erg cm@xmath27s@xmath4 , which is consistent with the previous upper limit for the cool component ( @xmath63 kev ) , 4 @xmath2410@xmath51 erg cm@xmath27s@xmath4 , obtained by _",
    "asca _ and pspc @xcite . when the metal abundance was varied between @xmath64 and 1.0 solar , the best - fit temperature varied only by 0.02 kev but the emission measure showed a change by a factor of about 2 .",
    "this is because the emission measure goes almost inversely proportional to the metal abundance .",
    "the total luminosities for the sum of ism and lmxbs in the energy range between 0.5 and 4.5 kev are 2.4 @xmath2410@xmath65 erg s@xmath4 and 1.6 @xmath2410@xmath65 erg s@xmath4 for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 , respectively .",
    "the lmxb emission accounts for 50% and 53% of the x - ray luminosities for the respective galaxies .",
    "radial profiles of the x - ray emission from the central two galaxies , ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 , are examined in some detail .",
    "the profiles before background subtraction in the energy range 0.5  1.5 kev are shown in figure [ fig : radial ] ( a1 ) and ( b1 ) within a radius of @xmath66 for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 , respectively .",
    "@xcite obtained the optical surface brightness profiles with a resolution of @xmath67 ( fwhm ) .",
    "these optical profiles are well represented by de vaucouleurs law for @xmath68 kpc ( ngc 3311 ) and for @xmath69 kpc ( ngc 3309 ) , respectively .",
    "the isophotal radii @xmath5 are @xmath70and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the optical surface brightness profiles @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission profiles are clearly sharper than those in the optical band .",
    "the x - ray profiles can be fitted with single @xmath14 models and a constant background .",
    "for the radial profile fittings , we use cern library package ( http://wwwinfo.cern.ch ) .",
    "thick solid lines in figures  [ fig : radial ] ( a1 ) and ( b1 ) indicate the best - fit models , which give @xmath72 and @xmath73 for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 , respectively .",
    "the parameters of the profile fits are listed in the third and forth rows in table  [ tab : beta ] , and the values for ngc 3311 are consistent with the previous joint fit including the icm in section 3.1 .",
    "both galaxies indicate core radii of about @xmath74 or 1.3 kpc , which is a typical value for elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 value ( @xmath75 ) for ngc 3309 is , however , much larger than the average value of 0.5 obtained for nearby bright elliptical galaxies with _ einstein _",
    "@xcite , indicating that the emission of a1060 galaxies falls very sharply .",
    "we also tried to fit the profile for ngc 3309 with a cut - off @xmath14 model by fixing @xmath76 , but the fit turned out to be unacceptable with @xmath77 .",
    "these profile fits confirm that the x - ray emission from the two galaxies are compact and contained within a small radius of @xmath78 .",
    "panels in the second row in figures  [ fig : radial ] show hardness ratios ( hrs ) , which are defined as intensity ratios between energy bands 1.5  5 kev and 0.5  1.5 kev .",
    "since the background is not subtracted , the fluxes contain contribution from ism , lmxb , icm and nxb .",
    "the hr profile indicates that in the inner region ( @xmath79 ) , the temperature is about 1 kev corresponding to the ism emission and gradually increase to the outer region .",
    "the hr profiles show that the temperature reaches a constant value in the outer region at @xmath80 .",
    "the hr of the icm as shown in the energy spectrum in figure [ fig : icm_radial ] is @xmath81 , which corresponds to about @xmath82 kev .",
    "we also note that the hr profiles of both galaxies show peaks at @xmath83 which are significant at the 95% confidence limit ( more than @xmath84 level ) .",
    "this feature is most naturally explained in terms of the emission from lmxbs , which produce harder spectrum ( @xmath85 kev ) than both ism and icm @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hr profiles indicate that the dominant source of the x - ray emission shifts from ism to lmxbs at @xmath86 , and then into icm at @xmath87 .    based on these results , we examined the radial profiles of the ism component only .",
    "the surface brightness of the nxb and the icm could be regarded as a constant in the galaxy scale as shown in the previous @xmath14 model fit . as for the lmxb emission , we assume that the spatial distribution follows the optical surface brightness profile @xcite and their energy spectra is given by a bremsstrahlung emission of @xmath88kev .",
    "this enables us to estimate the lmxb luminosity as a function of radius as shown by hatched curves in figure  [ fig : radial ] ( a3 ) and ( b3 ) .",
    "we included the errors due to the flux of the lmxb emission , the temperature and the abundance of the ism emission .",
    "after subtracting the contributions from lmxb , icm and nxb in this manner , we can obtain the ism profile as the remaining feature .",
    "we present the radial ism profiles in the energy band 0.5  1.5 kev for ngc 3309 and ngc 3311 in figure  [ fig : radial ] ( a3 ) and ( b3 ) , respectively .",
    "the radial profiles in figure  [ fig : radial ] ( a3 ) and ( b3 ) clearly indicate that the sizes of the ism emission are as small as @xmath89 kpc . if we fit the ism profiles with a @xmath14 model , the obtained @xmath14 values are @xmath90 for ngc3311 and @xmath91 for ngc3309 , respectively .",
    "the large @xmath14 value for ngc 3309 suggests that the ism is not in a simple condition characterized by an isothermal gas under a hydrostatic equilibrium in a king shape gravitational potential .",
    "based on these @xmath14 model fits , the central gas densities are estimated as @xmath92 @xmath2410@xmath27 cm@xmath26 for ngc 3311 and @xmath94 @xmath2410@xmath4cm@xmath26 for ngc 3309 , respectively .",
    "hardness ratios for the ism components , defined by the ratio of the counts between 0.9 1.5 kev and 0.5  0.9 kev bands , are also shown as a function of radius in ( a4 ) and ( b4 ) . within the error",
    ", the ism temperatures are consistent to be constant with radius up to about @xmath54 for both ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 .",
    "as we show later in the discussion , the lmxb luminosities in ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 are relatively higher than an x - ray faint galaxy ngc 4697 @xcite .",
    "but even if we reduce the lmxb luminosity to the half of the best - fit value , the change in the hardness ratios are less than 10 % or 0.05 kev . however , at the same time we can not reject a model that the ism temperature gradually goes up with radius from the central @xmath95 kev and reaches about 3 kev ( @xmath96 icm value ) at @xmath97 , because of the large error .",
    "the present _ chandra _ observation of a1060 showed that the icm temperature within @xmath57 from the center was consistent with the previous _ asca _ and _ rosat _ results , @xmath98 kev .",
    "the spectrum showed no temperature drop or additional cool component except for the ism emission from the two elliptical galaxies .",
    "the surface brightness profile clearly indicated two components , i.e.  the spatially narrow emission confined within the cd galaxy ngc3311 and the widespread icm component , with the latter well approximated by a simple @xmath14 model with @xmath99 and core radius @xmath100 .",
    "properties of the icm distribution over the large scale will be studied in our next paper ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from the ism of two giant elliptical galaxies , ngc3309 and ngc3311 , was clearly resolved for the first time .",
    "their spatial extents are as small as @xmath78 , or less than @xmath101 . according to the recent x - ray classification of elliptical galaxies by @xcite , these sizes are very small even among the x - ray faint and compact class .",
    "this feature is very similar to the recent _ chandra _ measurement of ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "the x - ray sizes of these coma galaxies are also unusually small , and the authors discuss that the ism pressure is balanced with the icm level with little sign of thermal conduction at the outer boundary of ism .    before looking into the origin of this compactness in the x - ray emission region , we first evaluate the luminosity and distribution of the lmxb component .",
    "@xcite studied x - ray to optical luminosity ratios of lmxbs in elliptical galaxies based on the data from _ chandra _ and _",
    "xmm_. for an x - ray faint elliptical galaxy ngc 4697 , they obtained @xmath102 erg s@xmath103 by taking the lmxb luminosity in the energy range 0.3 - 10 kev . for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 ,",
    "the same ratios for the entire emission region are higher at 2.9 @xmath2410@xmath104 and 1.3 @xmath2410@xmath104erg s@xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the reason why a1060 galaxies indicate higher @xmath105 for lmxbs can be considered in the following way .",
    "first , since @xcite summed up the fluxes of only detected sources , the faint lmxbs with fluxes less than the detection limit were not included .",
    "second , there may be some influence from nuclear radio sources for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 .",
    "@xcite reported a weak radio source in ngc 3311 and a radio jet from ngc 3309 , whose equipartition energy was 5 @xmath2410@xmath106 erg s@xmath4 . in the x - ray data , we can not exclude possible presence of low - luminosity agns with @xmath107 erg s@xmath4 in the center of these galaxies .",
    "thirdly , the possible star - formation activity in ngc 3311 would yield a high lmxb density .",
    "the emission line spectrum from ngc 3311 suggests presence of h ii regions @xcite , and the metal abundance in globular clusters in ngc 3311 is extremely high @xcite implying a young star population .",
    "recent hst observation , however , obtained normal globular cluster colors and metallicities @xcite , which has made the high metallicity of ngc 3311 rather uncertain .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath105 relation for the ism of 27 galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : lxlb ] , we reproduced figure 4 of @xcite and plotted the @xmath0 data of ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 .",

    "fractions of the optical luminosity encircled by these radii are 15.0% and 28.6% for the respective galaxies .",
    "if optical luminosities only in these regions are taken , @xmath111 ratios become higher by a factor of 46 as shown with filled pentagrams in figure [ fig : lxlb ] .",
    "these ratios are higher than most of other galaxies .",
    "the spatial extents of the hot ism in ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 are certainly smaller than those of stars , nevertheless the x - ray luminosities satisfy the average @xmath112 relation . we note that the x - ray luminosities derived in this paper could be underestimated by a factor of about two at maximum due to the uncertainity of the quantum efficincy of the acis at the low energy band",
    ". however , the tendency described here is not affected .",
    "a possible explanation would be that , even though a substantial fraction of the ism is stripped off , the remaining gas is confined in the galaxy by the external pressure of the icm . in figure",
    "[ fig : pressure ] , we plotted radial profiles of the ism density @xmath113 ( cm@xmath26 ) and the pressure @xmath114 ( kev cm@xmath26 ) , compared with the icm pressure @xcite .",
    "clearly , the pressure balance between the ism and the icm is reached just around the outer boundaries of x - ray emission : 2.8 kpc and 1.7 kpc for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 , respectively .    as for the supply of the ism matter",
    ", the total mass of the ism is estimated to be 5.6 @xmath2410@xmath115 @xmath116 for ngc 3311 and 1.1 @xmath2410@xmath115 @xmath116 for ngc 3309 , respectively . under a typical stellar mass loss rate of @xmath117yr@xmath118 @xcite",

    "therefore , the stellar mass loss , together with the input from supernova , can compensate the radiative energy loss . however , if thermal evaporation works at the rate of the classical estimation by @xcite , the ism would be completely lost in only a few times @xmath121 yrs .",

    "the ism temperature of ngc 4889 ( @xmath123 kev ) was too high compared with the gravitational potential of the galaxy , and a positive temperature gradient was observed in ngc 4874 .",
    "these features suggested the importance of heat input from the surrounding icm . in the a1060 galaxies ,",
    "the conductive heat flux from the icm would be smaller because of much lower icm temperature ( @xmath42 kev compared with @xmath124 kev in the coma cluster ) .",
    "the temperature gradient is not clearly recognized in the ism , although the poor statistics allow some temperature increase with radius .",
    "the ism temperature can also be evaluated from the @xmath125 relation @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersions are 187 km s@xmath4 for ngc 3311 and 236 km s@xmath4 for ngc",
    "3309 @xcite , respectively , leading to @xmath126 values of 0.252 and 0.453 .",
    "since typical @xmath127 values within @xmath128 are 0.51 @xcite , the ism in ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 is hotter than the kinetic temperature of the stars .",
    "since heat conduction at the outer edge of the ism is likely to be suppressed from the evaporation argument , the high temperatures in the a1060 galaxies would be the result of adiabatic compression of the ism in the cluster .    now , let us consider about the dynamical state of the ism in ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 . as shown above , even though the radiative cooling times of several times 10@xmath119 years are short , inputs from stellar mass loss and type-1a supernova can maintain the present amount of the ism .",
    "the low @xmath127 values suggest that the hot ism have sufficient energy to escape from the galaxy potential , even though there is no morphological sign of galactic winds",
    ". a slow evaporation of the ism due to the suppressed conductive heat input from the icm may be the actual process going on . regarding the large scatter of the @xmath105 ratios , models incorporating partial winds",
    "have been recently developed ( e.g.   pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) . according to the model",
    ", the change of stagnation radius between the outflowing outer region and the inflowing inner region controls the x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , these models consider isolated systems and the effect of external pressure needs to be further studied .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of the central region of a1060 has confirmed that the cluster is indeed the archetype isothermal cluster under hydrostatic equilibrium . when the ism emission is subtracted , the icm emission is shown to be very isothermal with no sign of cool component , even though the systematic uncertainty in the soft band response hampers us to set a meaningful upper limit .",
    "the x - ray size of the `` cd '' galaxy ngc 3311 is very compact with no extended potential structure , which has been commonly seen in x - ray bright elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "morphological study of a large sample of pspc images , on the other hand , showed that the cooling flow clusters tend to indicate more circularly symmetric shapes than the systems accompanied by radio halos and relics @xcite . in this respect",
    ", a1060 seems to be standing at a subtle location in the evolution process .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that cooling flows can be disrupted by major mergers @xcite and a highly inhomogeneous temperature distribution should remain for about 2 gyr @xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation for a1060 is that a sufficiently long time ( @xmath129 gyr ) has passed from the last major merger , which has stirred the central icm , so that good isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium was reached .",
    "however , the elapsed time is not long enough to assemble the matter and to establish a hierarchical potential structure dominated by the cd galaxy .",
    "this picture is also consistent with the observed uniform distribution of metals in the a1060 icm @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ observation of the central region of the relaxed cluster of galaxies , a1060 , confirmed that the temperature of the icm was almost constant from outside to the inner 20 kpc region .",
    "the x - ray emission from the ism of the two giant elliptical galaxies , ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 , were clearly resolved .",
    "x - ray properties of the two galaxies are very similar and the ism morphologies do not show a stripping feature even though the velocity difference between the two galaxies is @xmath122 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the ism temperatures are constant at 0.70.9 kev , and the x - ray to optical luminosity ratios for the sum of the ism and lmxb components are within the scatter for other galaxies .",
    "the spatial extents of the ism emission are , however , as small as @xmath130 kpc for both galaxies , and the pressure balance between the ism and the icm is achieved at the ism boundaries .",
    "we discuss , based on these results , that the ism is mainly supplied from stellar mass loss and is confined by the external pressure of icm , with highly suppressed heat conduction .",
    "the icm in the central region of a1060 is relaxed , and the extended potential structure around the cd galaxies has not grown up yet , possibly due to gas mixing in past merger episodes .",
