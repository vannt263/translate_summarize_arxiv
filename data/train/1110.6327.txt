    "for example , in the decimal numeration system @xmath16 if the base @xmath5 is not an integer and the alphabet @xmath12 is rich enough to represent all positive reals , then almost all @xmath17 have infinitely many representations and one can choose among them `` the nicest '' one from some point of view . , the shopkeepers consider the representation @xmath18 nicer than @xmath19 for @xmath20 . ]",

    "this @xmath5-representation is computed by the so called greedy algorithm , it is referred to as the greedy representation . on the other hand , the lexicographically smallest @xmath4-representation is called lazy",
    ". one might also be interested in other representations in positive base systems , for an extensive overview we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the study of greedy representations for non - integer bases @xmath23 was initiated by rnyi in  1957  @xcite .",
    "an interest in lazy representations for bases @xmath24 with alphabet @xmath25 was started in 1990 by works of erds , jo and komornik  @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of lazy representations for all bases @xmath23 can be found in the work of dajani and kraaikamp @xcite from 2002 .",
    "recently , ito and sadahiro  @xcite introduced a numeration system with a negative base @xmath26 and with the alphabet @xmath27 .",
    "they gave an algorithm for computing a @xmath2-representation of @xmath28 and showed that the natural order on @xmath29 corresponds to the alternate order on such @xmath2-representations . using a negative base",
    ", we can represent positive and negative numbers without an additional bit for the signum @xmath30 .",
    "a family of transformations producing negative base representations of numbers for @xmath31 is studied in  @xcite . among others",
    ", it is shown that although none of them gives the maximal representation in the alternate order , it is produced by a random algorithm , see theorem 4.2 . in  @xcite . in its proof",
    ", one can find out that the greedy representation is obtained by periodic application of two transformations .",
    "in this article , we focus on negative bases @xmath0 , @xmath1 in general , and deduce analogous result without introducing random @xmath2-expansions . our main result states that both extremal representations can be obtained using the positive base @xmath3 and a non - integer alphabet @xmath32 by application of a transformation of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( theorems  [ t : greedybetanadruhou ] and  [ t : lazybetanadruhou ] ) .",

    "finally , we illustrate how the characterization of admissible greedy and lazy representations can be applied for the study of uniquely representable numbers ( section  [ sec : unique ] ) .",
    "in this chapter we recall a method for finding an @xmath5-representation of a given number with general real base @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
