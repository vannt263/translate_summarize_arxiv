    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( _ lisa _ ) is a proposed joint esa / nasa mission that will be the first space - based gravitational radiation ( gr ) detector ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it has been known for some time @xcite that galactic double white dwarfs will be a prominent source of gr for _ lisa_. thousands of galactic double white dwarfs are expected to be resolved well enough to yield their masses and orbital parameters @xcite , which will lead to an improved understanding of common envelope evolution scenarios and the origin of type ia supernova and/or subdwarf b star progenitors @xcite",
    ". however , a much larger number of double white dwarfs ( @xmath3 ) will be detectable within the _ lisa _ sensitivity range but will be unresolved .",
    "in fact , close double white dwarfs are so numerous that they are expected to dominate the _ lisa _",
    "gr signal at low frequencies , for circular binaries . ]",
    "their signal rising above that of the instrumental noise level and generating confusion - limited noise - a confusion ` foreground ' .",
    "thus , in order to attempt to uncover sources beneath the confusion noise , one must construct the expected total gr signal from these binaries and remove it from the _ lisa _ data stream . to do this",
    ", it is of considerable importance to determine a priori the characteristics which will set the level of signal ( e.g. , masses , orbital periods , location in the galaxy , etc . ) of the double white dwarf population .",
    "in addition , the level of signal arising from galactic double white dwarfs can be useful in constraining the structure and extent of the galactic thick disk @xcite .",
    "the contribution of low- and intermediate - mass extragalactic binaries to the _ lisa _ signal was shown to be rather insignificant in comparison with the galactic populations @xcite .",
    "the gr signal from galactic and extragalactic black hole macho binaries was investigated by @xcite and it was in general found that black hole binaries at cosmological distances will have a higher impact on _ lisa _ than will the halo black hole machos , although the foreground signal from galactic double white dwarfs will still dominate .",
    "the _ lisa _ gr signal arising from the galactic population of double white dwarfs has been investigated by several groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in most previous calculations ,",
    "the galactic gr signal was calculated for a single component disk with the bulge excluded , until recently where a bulge component has been considered @xcite .",
    "we note that while the signal arising from the bulge should not be discounted , the galactic disk is the major contributor to the _ lisa _ gr signal out of the two populations ( see   [ results ] for further explanation ) . up until now , a full calculation of the _ lisa _ gr signal due to the halo population of binaries has never been calculated .",
    "@xcite estimated that a galactic halo white dwarf population will produce a gr signal significantly exceeding that of a disk population , though it was hypothesized by @xcite that such a strong gr signal from the halo is unlikely given the physical characteristics of a @xmath4 gyr halo stellar population .",
    "we demonstrate that the latter is indeed true , and argue against the existence of a strong halo gr signal with our detailed calculations  4 .    in this study ,",
    "we calculate the _ lisa _ gr signal arising from white dwarf binaries in the galactic halo .",
    "we include in our signal calculation any double white dwarf within the _ lisa _ sensitivity range : @xmath5 hz ( orbital periods between @xmath6 hours and 20 s ) .",
    "we note here that this work is a followup study to our previous , more detailed study of the _ lisa _ signal arising from double white dwarfs in the milky way disk and bulge .",
    "thus , for a thorough description of population synthesis modeling , signal calculations or binary evolutionary histories , we refer the reader to that study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* which we will refer to from now on as rbblw ) .",
    "the main objective of this work is to determine whether or not the halo population , omitted in most previous studies , will provide a significant contribution to the _ lisa _ gr signal .",
    "since we do not know the contribution of white dwarfs , in number or in mass , to the galactic halo , we use two extreme models to bracket our uncertainties . in one model",
    "we set the halo contribution to zero ( e.g. , no white dwarfs in the halo and the halo white dwarf baryonic mass fraction @xmath7 ) , while in the other we assume that all of the baryonic halo mass is in white dwarfs ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we then calculate models within these brackets to compare the various halo realizations to that of the galactic disk@xmath1bulge population to determine if ( and at what point ) the gr signal from halo double white dwarfs becomes significant compared to that of the rest of the galaxy .",
    "we discuss our results in context of recent microlensing experiments in order to constrain our intermediate models , and comment on the prospects for future _ lisa _ observations in   [ discussion ] . in ",
    "[ model ] we describe our calculations , and in   [ results ] we present our results of the halo gravitational wave signal juxtaposed with the galactic ( disk and bulge ) gravitational foreground calculations of rbblw and @xcite .",
    "the galactic baryonic halo mass , potential , and shape are all poorly constrained @xcite . in general , halo properties",
    "are estimated from star counts of thousands of intrinsically bright stars , such as red giants , blue horizontal branch stars , and rr lyrae variables , with associated photometric or spectroscopic parallaxes .",
    "there is strong evidence that at least some of the halo was built by destroying satellite galaxies , resulting in a `` stringy '' halo structure  @xcite .",
    "some obvious evidence for this may be found in the magellanic stream , a tidal arc of stars stretching over 100@xmath9 of the sky  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , for this first attempt , we employ the canonical well - mixed spherically symmetric halo with a total baryonic mass of @xmath10 m@xmath11 and a density profile as follows @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scale radius of 3.5 kpc .",
    "once we have the mass model , we can populate the halo with our binaries .",
    "we use the startrack population synthesis code for single and binary evolution @xcite to evolve our halo stellar population .",
    "we assume one metallicity and age for the entire halo , although we note that the halo has been observed to be comprised of two distinct components varying in metallicity @xcite , and may very well have a triaxial shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the halo population we use an evolution model which incorporates : _",
    "i ) _ low metallicity @xmath14 , _ ii ) _ a burst of star formation at @xmath15 gyr , and _",
    "iii ) _ is evolved through 13 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our spatial distribution and evolutionary model parameters for the disk@xmath1bulge population are described in detail in  2 of rbblw , but we summarize the differences here : _",
    "i ) _ the disk and bulge stellar populations are evolved with near - solar ( @xmath16 ) metallicity , _ ii ) _ the disk has a constant star formation history for 10 gyr , the bulge has a constant star formation history for the first gyr with none thereafter , and _",
    "iii ) _ both disk and bulge populations are 10 gyr old .",
    "the remaining evolutionary parameters for disk , bulge and halo populations are the same .",
    "once the halo stellar population has been evolved , we record the physical properties of the close white dwarf binaries ( orbital periods @xmath17 hours ) and calibrate the results .",
    "we construct a grid of models in which we constrain the total mass of white dwarf stars in the present halo relative to the total baryonic halo mass .",
    "we choose 4 different realizations of the halo , keeping the halo mass constant , only varying the parameter which sets the fraction , by mass , of white dwarf stars ( single and binary ) within it ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "binarity of 50% is assumed .",
    "we choose mass fractions of 0% ( no white dwarfs in the halo ) and 100% as the extreme cases . for intermediate cases ,",
    "we choose 2 models of 15% and 30% ( based on microlensing results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we extract all double white dwarfs with gr frequencies within the _ lisa _ sensitivity range ( @xmath19 hz ) to calculate the spectral amplitudes , and compare the _",
    "halo spectra to that of the galactic disk@xmath1bulge .",
    "we calculate the _ lisa _ timestream signals using the approach of @xcite , which are added together yielding the total observatory data stream , which is then fourier transformed in order to produce the frequency domain data ( the spectra presented in   [ results ] ) .",
    "the actual _ lisa _ gr spectra is obtained using the @xcite simulation code .",
    "we note that all of our white dwarf binaries within the _ lisa _ sensitivity range have circular orbits .",
    "eccentric white dwarf binaries are expected to arise from dynamical interactions in globular clusters @xcite , where the phase space densities are much higher than in the halo or the disk .",
    "these eccentric binaries , however , could provide a unique opportunity for learning about white dwarf structure with _",
    "lisa _ @xcite .",
    "for @xmath8 in a @xmath20 halo , we obtain @xmath21 white dwarfs ( single and binary ) ; @xmath22 binary white dwarfs and out of these @xmath23 _ lisa _ binary white dwarfs .",
    "only @xmath24 of double white dwarfs have periods shorter than 5.6 hr . obviously , the above numbers scale down linearly with @xmath18",
    ". chemo - dynamical simulations of the milky way @xcite have demonstrated that a white dwarf dominated halo that is evolved from a white dwarf progenitor - dominated initial mass function @xcite at early times would lead to an overproduction of carbon and nitrogen when compared to observed abundances , so the @xmath8 model is unrealistic . for a realistic upper limit on the white dwarf halo contribution",
    "we choose @xmath25 based on ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 2 ; also brook et al .",
    "( 2003 ) their  5 ) , and this yields @xmath26 _ lisa _ double white dwarfs in the halo . for a galactic disk@xmath1bulge with a total stellar mass of @xmath27 for _ all _ stellar types @xcite",
    ", we predict a total of @xmath28 white dwarfs ; @xmath29 double white dwarfs , out of which only @xmath30 are found within the _ lisa _ band : @xmath31 ( see rbblw ",
    "note that the halo is presumed to include a specific fraction of mass in white dwarfs ( @xmath18 ) , therefore the predicted numbers of white dwarfs are a direct result of the _",
    "i ) _ adopted halo mass and _ ii ) _ calculated ( with population synthesis ) mass and period distributions for halo white dwarf binaries with the assumed binary fraction . for the rest of the galaxy , in addition to the calculation of double white dwarf properties , we have computed the white dwarf mass fraction with the adopted galactic field initial mass function ( for details see rbblw ) .",
    "in other words the disk@xmath1bulge model results in a true white dwarf formation efficiency per unit mass , while in the halo model this efficiency is imposed a priori ( through the straight forward application of observational constraints , e.g. , machos ) .",
    "the disk and halo double white dwarf populations differ significantly in numbers and physical properties , due to the different environments under which stellar evolution proceeds ( metallicity , age , star formation history ) .",
    "for example , typical average double white dwarf chirp masses ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the first formed and second formed white dwarf masses , respectively ) of halo systems are @xmath35 as compared to @xmath36 for the disk . also , there are relatively few short period double white dwarfs in the halo ( 5.5% vs. 8.0% for the disk@xmath1bulge ) since this population is older and a larger number of short period systems have merged . in particular , some double white dwarf systems form on rather short orbits ( e.g. , hybrid white dwarfs with carbon - oxygen white dwarf companions ) , and none of these systems are found in our 13 gyr old halo population ( see below ) .    in figure  [ dndf ]",
    "we show the number density ( per resolvable frequency bin ) of _ lisa _ white dwarf binaries as a function of gr frequency for both the halo and the combined disk@xmath1bulge population of rbblw . at nearly all frequencies ,",
    "the disk@xmath1bulge population outnumbers the halo by nearly a factor of two ( @xmath37 45 vs. @xmath37 28 million _ lisa _ binaries ) .",
    "however , there is a relative increase in the number of halo systems between @xmath38 hz ( @xmath39 minute orbital periods ) .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that there is a relatively higher number of rlof double white dwarfs with hydrogen white dwarf donors in the halo population .",
    "double degenerate binaries with hydrogen white dwarfs take a long time to form ; on the order of @xmath40 years as opposed to @xmath41 for other , heavier double wd types ( e.g. , co - co , hybrid - co ) descended from more massive progenitors .",
    "remnant binaries formed from progenitors with more massive stars are more common in the ( younger ) galactic disk .",
    "hydrogen white dwarfs are evolved from binary progenitors in which a white dwarf ( e.g. , carbon - oxygen or helium ) is feeding from a low - mass main sequence star . at some stage during the mass transfer , m@xmath42 yr@xmath43 . ]",
    "the main sequence donor becomes depleted of enough mass - to a mass below that of the hydrogen - burning limit - such that it is no longer capable of fusing hydrogen in its core and thus becomes degenerate ( a hydrogen white dwarf is born ; specific details about the evolution of these systems can be found in  3.1 of rbblw ) . because all of the binaries in the halo are 13 gyr old , most pre - stable rlof systems",
    "have had time to reach contact , and many binaries which have evolved from more massive progenitors have since merged .",
    "double white dwarfs involving hydrogen donors make up 75 % of our _ lisa _ binary white dwarfs in the 13 gyr old halo , spanning a frequency range from @xmath44 hz . by contrast",
    ", white dwarf binaries with hydrogen white dwarfs only make up 40 % of the slightly younger bulge population ( @xmath45 gyr ) and only 13 % of the younger disk population .",
    "additionally , only the disk population contains close white dwarf binaries with @xmath46 mhz ( orbital periods less than 8 minutes ) , the majority of which are co white dwarfs accreting from helium white dwarfs ( a class of am cvn binaries ; @xcite ) .",
    "regarding massive white dwarfs , only 1.5 % of _ lisa _ halo double white dwarfs are co+co systems , where as this fraction is 12 % for the disk . out of the halo co+co systems",
    ", @xmath47 will merge within a hubble time and have combined masses above @xmath48 m@xmath42 , making them potential double degenerate scenario type ia supernovae @xcite .    to obtain a better idea of the effect that location in the milky way",
    "has on the gr amplitude , in figure  [ dist ] we show the number density distribution as a function of distance from the sun for the three halo realizations , as well as the disk and bulge populations of rbblw .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the halo signal is expected to be less than that of the rest of the milky way , given the extensive yet sparse stellar density distribution with respect to the bulge and disk .",
    "it becomes clear that even though the number of halo double white dwarfs are only about a factor of @xmath49 in number below the disk@xmath1bulge combined , the gr amplitude is expected to be much weaker given the @xmath50 dependence @xcite , and the fact that the physical properties of the double white dwarfs ( chirp masses , separations ) in all three populations are not drastically different .    in figure  [ sig ]",
    "we show spectral amplitude vs. gr frequency of three galactic halo double white dwarf realizations : 15% , 30% and 100% halo models .",
    "in addition to our halo signals we show the _ lisa _ sensitivity curve , the median signal arising from the galactic population from rbblw ( see their section 3.4.1 ) , and the signal of the double white dwarf foreground of @xcite .",
    "the shape of the _ lisa _ instrumental noise curve is a function of the acceleration noise ( from _ lisa _ s accelerometers ) , position noise and the gravitational wave transfer function ( see @xcite for a more detailed description of how the curve is calculated ) . the signal presented in @xcite is a measure of the barycentred double white dwarf _ confusion foreground _",
    "amplitude @xmath51 ( rather than spectral amplitude @xmath52 , see @xcite ) , and is artificially truncated beyond @xmath53 mhz where individual binaries become resolved and the signal is no longer confusion - limited in that study , where as the signal from rbblw is shown for a range of frequencies . we have scaled the amplitude of @xcite by @xmath54 , accounting for a 1-yr observation time for _ lisa _ and signal modulation due to the motion of _ lisa _ , respectively , to arrive at the root spectral density ( spectral amplitude ) @xmath52 .",
    "we note that for even our most extreme ( and unphysical ) halo realization of @xmath8 , the halo signal is well below the signals of both @xcite and rbblw , as well as the _ lisa _ sensitivity curve .",
    "the amplitude of the gr signal from halo white dwarfs was previously estimated by @xcite . in that study , @xcite used @xcite to estimate the number of disk white dwarfs , and arrived at the number ( both single and binary ) @xmath55 . @xcite",
    "assumed that the properties of the halo white dwarfs were the same as those of the disk .",
    "next they adopted the number of halo white dwarfs to be @xmath56 .",
    "this was based on the mass of machos ( @xmath57 halo objects with masses @xmath58 derived by the macho collaboration @xcite ) , and the assumption that _ all _ machos are white dwarfs . note that this results in a halo mass of @xmath59 ; @xcite does not present the actual numbers of double white dwarfs that are within the _ lisa _ band for the halo nor for the disk populations .",
    "naturally , @xcite obtain , due to a very high number of halo white dwarfs , a very strong gr signal from the halo population .",
    "in fact they estimated that the level of signal from the halo could be a factor of @xmath0 stronger than the one arising from the disk .",
    "comparison of predictions clearly shows that our number for the _ entire _",
    "disk@xmath1bulge white dwarf population ( @xmath60 ) is similar to the disk prediction of @xcite .",
    "however , their number for the entire halo white dwarf population is @xmath53 orders of magnitude higher than we can presently use based on star count data @xcite : even if we place the entire baryonic halo mass of @xmath20 in white dwarfs we obtain only @xmath61 white dwarfs in the halo , while for a more realistic halo model ( @xmath62 ) our number is @xmath63 ( see  3 ) .",
    "such a large discrepancy in the estimate of the number of white dwarfs in the halo leads to a very different final result .",
    "in particular , our halo contribution is never higher than the galactic disk@xmath1bulge signal .",
    "this marked difference stems from the fact that we employ a much smaller ( baryonic ) mass of the halo ( @xmath64 ) than @xcite ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the simple fact is that with a milky way virial mass of approximately @xmath66 m@xmath11 @xcite , the maximum baryonic mass in the _ entire _ galaxy can not be more than @xmath67 m@xmath11 without violating the strong constraint on @xmath68 set by wmap3 @xcite . given that the milky way disk and bulge itself is known to have a mass @xmath69 m@xmath11 @xcite , it is extremely unlikely that the baryonic halo can be as massive as @xmath70 m@xmath11 . even if there were significant play in the total baryonic mass of the halo , a white dwarf population of @xmath70 m@xmath11",
    "would have had to have lost approximately @xmath71 m@xmath11 in gas during the planetary nebulae phase , and this much gas is likely to have been observed .",
    "we have calculated the _ lisa _ gravitational radiation signal predicted to arise from double white dwarfs in the galactic halo . in doing so , we have performed the first detailed calculation of the halo double white dwarf population and compared its signal to that of the disk@xmath1bulge population .",
    "thus , for the first time there is a complete model milky way galaxy ( disk , bulge , halo ) calculated self - consistently with the same binary evolution population synthesis code .",
    "the evolutionary calculations were done with the population synthesis code startrack @xcite , and the gr signal calculations were obtained with the detailed _ lisa _ simulation code of @xcite . it was found that the gr signal arising from the halo population is significantly smaller than that of the rest of the galaxy , and will not contribute substantially to the overall galactic foreground signal .",
    "further , if we use recent microlensing results in order to constrain the mass of the halo white dwarf population to @xmath72 of the halo baryonic mass , we predict that the gr signal arising from the halo is at the level of @xmath73 hz@xmath74 at 1 mhz ( see figure  [ sig ] ) .",
    "the disk@xmath1bulge double white dwarf population generates a much larger noise level : @xmath75 hz@xmath74 at 1 mhz both for the startrack disk@xmath1bulge population ( ruiter et al .",
    "2007 ) as well as for the previous prediction for the combined galactic disk@xmath1bulge population obtained with a different population synthesis model @xcite .    therefore",
    ", throughout the low - frequency region where the disk@xmath1bulge signal is confusion - limited , the halo signal is a factor of @xmath76 ( 1.1 in log compared to the foreground of ruiter et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) lower than that of the disk@xmath1bulge . since we have used an upper limit on the white dwarf contribution in the halo , and the actual halo white dwarf content",
    "is probably not higher than @xmath77 , ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for an estimate and discussion of the number density of halo white dwarfs ) , we predict that the actual halo signal will be more than @xmath78 lower than that of the disk and bulge combined . the reduced number of high - frequency halo systems compared with the disk population will result in a small number of potentially resolvable systems from the halo , since no halo systems are found with gr frequencies above 4.4 mhz ( see figure  [ dndf ] ) .",
    "a number of galactic binaries predicted to be resolved with _",
    "lisa _ have frequencies above this value ( log(@xmath79)@xmath80 ; @xcite ) .",
    "even for an unrealistic halo model for which @xmath8 , the level of the average halo gr signal does not significantly approach that of the disk@xmath1bulge , and remains below the _ lisa _ sensitivity curve .",
    "it is clear that _ lisa _ s ability to detect other sources will not be strongly curtailed by halo double white dwarfs , and that the gr signal from white dwarf binaries in the rest of the galaxy ( primarily the disk ) will still constitute the prime limiting confusion foreground for _",

    "<S> our comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the galactic disk@xmath1bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double white dwarf halo signal to exceed that of the rest of the galaxy . using microlensing results to give an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo ( @xmath2 baryonic mass in white dwarfs ) , </S>",
