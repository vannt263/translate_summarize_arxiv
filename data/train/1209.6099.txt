    "one of the longstanding problems in universal algebra is ,    [ fclrp ] * finite congruence lattice representation problem : * for which finite lattices @xmath1 is there a finite algebra @xmath2 with @xmath3 ?",
    "a _ primitive positive formula _ is a first - order formula of the form @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is a set of relations on a finite set @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of all relations on @xmath6 definable using primitive positive formulas and relations from @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the set of all equivalence relations in @xmath5 .",
    "it follows from @xcite that @xmath5 is the set of all universes of direct powers of an algebra @xmath2 with universe @xmath6 if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "( for references on similar characterizations , the reader can see @xcite . )",
    "therefore , problem [ fclrp ] can be restated in the following way .",
    "[ ppfp ] for which finite lattices @xmath1 is there a lattice @xmath10 of equivalence relations on a finite set so that @xmath11 and @xmath12 ?",
    "a natural extension of this problem is to consider first - order definitions employing types of formulas other than primitive positive formulas .",
    "we suggest replacing primitive positive formulas here with any first - order formulas using at most three variables .",
    "if @xmath5 is a set of relations on a finite set @xmath6 , let @xmath13 be the set of all relations on @xmath6 definable using first - order formulas with at most three variables and relations from @xmath5 .",
    "our extension of [ ppfp ] can be stated as :    [ fo3p ] for which finite lattices @xmath1 is there a lattice @xmath10 of equivalence relations on a finite set so that @xmath11 and @xmath14 ?",
    "our interest in first - order formulas with three variables stems from a connection with relation algebras .",
    "relation algebra _ is an algebra @xmath15 with operations intended mimic the operations of union , complement , composition , converse , and identity on binary relations .",
    "a relation algebra @xmath2 is _ representable _ if there is a set of binary relations @xmath5 on a set @xmath16 so that @xmath2 is isomorphic to the algebra @xmath17 . a set @xmath5 of binary relations on a finite set @xmath6 is closed under the relation algebra operations if and only if every binary relation on @xmath6 definable with a first - order formula with at most three variables and relations in @xmath5 is already in @xmath5 ( see theorem 3.32 of @xcite or page 172 of @xcite ) . for any set @xmath5 of binary relations on a set @xmath6 , let @xmath18 be the relation algebra generated by @xmath5 .",
    "then the above problem becomes :    [ rap ] for which finite lattices @xmath1 is there a lattice @xmath10 of equivalence relations on a finite set so that @xmath11 and @xmath19 ?    for any relation algebra @xmath2 , let @xmath20 be equivalence relation elements of @xmath2 .",
    "then our problem becomes :    for which finite lattices @xmath1 is there a relation algebra @xmath2 which is representable on a finite set so that @xmath21 ?",
    "in this section we give two examples @xmath22 and @xmath23 of lattices of equivalence relations on finite sets . in the first example , @xmath24 but @xmath25 . in the second example , @xmath26 but @xmath27 .",
    "this demonstrates that these two notions are indeed distinct .",
    "first , let @xmath28 be the two - element lattice with universe",
    "let @xmath30 , and let @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath22 contains four equivalence relations  the identity relation , the universal relation , and the kernels of the projection homomorphisms .",
    "the projection kernels are the relations @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined so that @xmath34 when @xmath35 and @xmath36 when @xmath37 . since @xmath22 is a congruence lattice , @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xmath38 also contains the equivalence relation @xmath39 which is not in @xmath22 , so @xmath25 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath40 can also be defined with this first - order formula which only uses _ two _ variables : @xmath41.\\ ] ] thus @xmath22 is closed under primitive positive definitions but not under the operations of relation algebras or first - order definitions using at most three variables .    for our second example , suppose that @xmath42 is prime .",
    "we consider @xmath43 , which is a copy of @xmath44 consisting of the identity @xmath45 , the universal relation @xmath46 , and @xmath47 atoms @xmath48 , given by @xmath49    [ lemma1 ] suppose that @xmath50 and let @xmath51",
    ". then @xmath26 .",
    "this lemma follows from @xcite ; the result is not explicitly stated in the paper , although it can be extracted from it . a proof is given in section [ mainsection ] .",
    "consider the relation @xmath52 ( which is not in @xmath23 ) ; @xmath52 can be defined from @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath53 with a primitive positive formula by @xmath54 thus @xmath27 .",
    "the lattice @xmath55 is closed under the operations of relation algebras and first - order definitions using at most three variables but not under primitive positive definitions .",
    "this second example has the following interesting consequence . if @xmath56 and if @xmath42 is a prime greater than @xmath57 , then the lattice @xmath23 in the example gives a lattice of equivalence relations closed under the operations of relation algebras which is isomorphic to @xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath59 and @xmath60 can easily be represented by letting @xmath23 be @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "thus we have    for any positive integer @xmath63 , there is a lattice @xmath23 of equivalence relations on a finite set so that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "in this section , we prove that @xmath66 . again , the results in this section are implicit in @xcite , but the relationship is not immediately apparent ; hence we provide  bottom - up \" proofs here .",
    "case 1 : @xmath70 .",
    "+ suppose for simplicity that @xmath71",
    ". then let @xmath72 and @xmath73 be any pairs in @xmath74 .",
    "we will show @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 . then @xmath77 .",
    "we need to show @xmath78 .",
    "we have @xmath79          thus we see that @xmath93 .",
    "now we define @xmath94 to be the sublattice of con@xmath95 consisting of the identity and universal relations , along with the atoms @xmath96 , and @xmath53 through @xmath97",
    ". then @xmath98 .",
    "first we establish the following claim : ba@xmath99ra@xmath100 , where ba@xmath100 is the boolean algebra generated by @xmath94 .",
    "the set @xmath101 of atoms of ba@xmath100 consists of the identity relation @xmath102 along with @xmath103 , and @xmath104 through @xmath105 , and the one additional atom @xmath106    to see this , consider the @xmath107 s and @xmath108 s .",
    "any distinct pair of these intersect to @xmath102 , so the @xmath109 s and @xmath110 s are minimal nonzero elements , hence are atoms .",
    "the boolean algebra generated by the @xmath111 s and the @xmath108 s will be the same as that generated by @xmath102 , the @xmath109 s and the @xmath110 s .    by proposition 4.4 of @xcite ,",
    "the boolean algebra generated by these atoms is equal to all joins of meets of atoms and their complements .",
    "since the meet of an atom @xmath112 with anything is either @xmath112 or 0 , we need only consider joins of meets of complements of atoms .",
    "since we are looking for the atoms of the boolean algebra , we need only consider meets of complements of atoms .",
    "all such meets will be above the meet of all such complements , which is @xmath113 thus @xmath68 is the only atom not previously listed .",
    "we need to show that any composition of atoms is already in ba@xmath100 . if @xmath114(ba@xmath100 ) , then @xmath115 , since @xmath112 is an equivalence relation ,  minus the identity \" , that has no singleton equivalence classes .",
    "if @xmath116 , then @xmath117      to establish the inclusion @xmath119 , consider the proof of case 2 of lemma [ lemma ] .",
    "it is not hard to check that if @xmath72 and @xmath73 are not related by @xmath102 , @xmath120 , or @xmath108 , then the pair @xmath82 given in the proof is distinct from both @xmath72 and @xmath73 . hence if @xmath121 then @xmath122    it remains to show that @xmath123 contains nothing but @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath125 and @xmath110 are disjoint symmetric diversity relations , their composition is disjoint from the identity . to prove that this composition is disjoint from @xmath120 ( and by symmetry from @xmath108 as well ) , suppose for contradiction that there exist pairwise distinct pairs @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 . then @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "then @xmath131 , and so @xmath132 .",
    "then @xmath133 as well , a contradiction . by a similar argument , @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the composition of atoms is a boolean combination of those atoms .",
    "since composition distributes over union , it follows that ba@xmath135 .",
    "+ now we are ready to show that eq(ra@xmath100)@xmath136 .",
    "first , we note that @xmath137 and @xmath53 through @xmath97 are the minimal non - identity elements in eq@xmath138 .",
    "so suppose that there is some other relation @xmath139 .",
    "since @xmath140ra@xmath99ba@xmath100 and since @xmath40 is not an atom , @xmath40 must contain at least two atoms .",
    "since @xmath40 also contains @xmath102 , @xmath40 contains two of the non - trivial relations @xmath141 , hence @xmath142 . but",
    "@xmath143 , hence @xmath144 .",
    "so the only non - trivial relations in eq(ra@xmath100 are @xmath141 along with the unit @xmath46 . therefore eq@xmath145 ."
