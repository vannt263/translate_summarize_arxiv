    "based on the theory of dynamical systems , hindmarsh and rose proposed the phenomenological neuron model , which may be seen either as a generalization of the fitzhugh equations or as a simplification of the physiologically realistic model proposed by hodgkin and huxley @xcite .",
    "the hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) model of neuronal activity is aimed to study the spiking - bursting behavior of the membrane potential observed in experiments of a cell in the brain of the pond snail @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a single hr neuron has been studied well , and it is illustrated that it can exhibit complex dynamical behavior including periodic and chaotic spiking ( bursting ) motion when certain control parameters of nervous cell models are varied @xcite .",
    "it is well accepted that the hr neuron model is an alternative candidate for studying the dynamics of neuronal systems since it has simpler mathematical forms than chay s and hodgkin and huxley s neuron models @xcite .",
    "therefore , this model has been used to study different aspects of neuronal dynamics such as transitions between different firing regimes @xcite , relations between block structured dynamics and neuronal coding @xcite , the effect of noise on neuronal signal transduction @xcite and on synchronization @xcite , the collective dynamics of neuronal networks @xcite and the evolution of spiral waves in coupled hindmarsh - rose neurons @xcite .",
    "however , an important phenomenon in neuron activity is the transition between different firing patterns . from the viewpoint of dynamical systems",
    ", it is crucial to investigate the transition mechanism of firing patterns for understanding realistic neuronal activities .",
    "the local stability and the numerical asymptotic analysis of the hindmarsh - rose model are used to investigate the firing evolution of a single hindmarsh - rose neuron @xcite .",
    "a simple one - dimensional map method has been applied to the hr neurons to convert irregular spiking and chaotic bursting to regular beating and periodic bursting @xcite .",
    "recently , we developed a parameter switching method to synthesize attractors of a class of dynamical systems , called hereafter attractors synthesis ( as ) algorithm .",
    "this method in fact starts from a set of given parameter values , and allows us , via periodic or random parameter - switching , to generate any of the set of all possible attractors of a class of continuous time dynamical systems of integer order@xcite,@xcite , or of fractional order @xcite , depending linearly on the control parameter .",
    "it has been applied successfully to several dynamical systems such as lorenz , chen , rssler , lotka - volterra , minimal networks , fractional l systems and so on . extending this subject",
    ", we will synthesize attractors of the hr neuronal model , which can exhibit burst dynamics , via the as method contributing to a better understanding of neuronal firing transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the hr model will be described in sec .",
    "2 ; the as method will be introduced in sec . 3 , and attractors will be synthesized in sec .",
    "4 . finally , the paper will end in sec . 5 with some comments and conclusions .",
    "the dynamics of an isolated hr neuron is governed by the following set of differential equations @xcite : @xmath0{cl}% \\overset{\\cdot}{x}_{1}= & bx_{1}^{2}-ax_{1}^{3}+x_{2}-x_{3}+i,\\\\ \\overset{\\cdot}{x}_{2}= & c - dx_{1}^{2}-x_{2},\\\\ \\overset{\\cdot}{x}_{3}= & p[s(x_{1}-\\overline{x}_{1})-x_{3 } ] , \\end{array } \\label{hr}%\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the membrane potential , @xmath2 is associated with the fast current , na@xmath3 , or k@xmath3 and @xmath4 with the slow current , for example , ca@xmath5 .",
    "the parameters are @xcite : @xmath6 @xmath7 ,  @xmath8 . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the control parameters , and @xmath11is a slow parameter while @xmath12is a fast parameter .",
    "@xmath9 mimics the membrane input current for biological neurons ; @xmath10 controls the speed of variation of the slow variable .    to find the fixed points we have to solve numerically the following equations : @xmath13  @xmath14 , and @xmath15 which gives the single real solution @xmath16 therefore the system ( [ hr ] ) has a single equilibrium point : @xmath17    parameter @xmath12 is the ratio of time scales between fast dynamics and slow dynamics .",
    "therefore , it controls the difference between the slow and the fast dynamics of hr neuron model corresponding to the difference between fast fluxes of ions across the membrane and slow ones .",
    "therefore , it is really interesting to investigate the dynamics of the hr neuron as the parameter @xmath12is changed .",
    "however , with @xmath9 as control parameter , the underlying dynamical system does not belong to the class of systems where as can be applied [ see section 3 ] .",
    "the bifurcation diagram of the first component @xmath1 versus @xmath12 is shown in fig .",
    "1a , b , c for @xmath18 , while that for @xmath19 in fig . 1d .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath18 because this case represents interesting dynamics , where chaos appears in a narrow range of @xmath10 with a width of about @xmath20 .",
    "1a gives the bifurcation diagram with respect to the control parameter @xmath12 in the range [ 0.0001 , 0.15 ] .",
    "it is shown that as the parameter @xmath12 is changed , the hr neuron firstly bifurcates from period - doubling to chaos , and then , it is stopped via the inverse period - doubling . for a clear vision , the enlargement of fig .",
    "1a is shown in fig .",
    "1b , which further confirms the above observation .",
    "further enlargement can clearly guide our assessment as illustrated in fig .",
    "more details on the dynamics of the hr model can be found in @xcite",
    "the as algorithm can be applied to the following general class of continuous - time autonomous and dissipative dynamical systems , modeled by the initial value problem ( ivp ) @xcite@xmath21 where @xmath22 is an @xmath23-valued function with a bifurcation parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and has the expression@xmath26 @xmath27is a continuous - time nonlinear function , @xmath28is a real constant @xmath29 matrix,@xmath30 , and @xmath31    this class of dynamical systems contains the best - known systems such as lorenz , chen , rssler , lotka - volterra , minimal networks , fractional l systems and so on ( see @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    "it has been shown , via numerical analysis and computer graphic simulations , that the as algorithm allows the synthesis of any attractor of @xmath32 by parameter switching following some designed rule .",
    "the as algorithm can explain what happens with a system when , intentionally or not , the parameter value switches quickly through a set of values .",
    "thus , when @xmath10 is switched following some designed deterministic @xcite or random @xcite rule , while the system evolves in time , an attractor belonging to the set of attractors is generated ( synthesized ) .",
    "the as algorithm can be useful in the cases where some desired control parameter value can not be directly accessed and we want to obtain the corresponding attractor .",
    "let us next suppose the following assumptions hold .",
    "* assumption * * a.1 .",
    "* throughout , the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the ivp ( [ ivpa])-([ivpb ] ) are assumed .",
    "as known , the computer graphic simulations of the numerical integration results of ( [ ivpa])-([ivpb ] ) can give excellent approximations to the orbits within the invariant sets @xcite .",
    "thus , the orbits which start near a hyperbolic attractor will stay near and they will be shadowed by orbits within the attractor .",
    "this happens because attractors arise as the limiting behavior of orbits .",
    "therefore , the shadowing property of hyperbolic sets @xcite enables us to recover long time approximation properties of numerical orbits such as hr s case .",
    "the as algorithm consists in using a time varying , or more precisely , a periodically switching parameter , according to some design rule",
    ". it will be shown , empirically by various experiments , that a desired targeted attractor can be duly obtained by the proposed switching scheme .",
    "the algorithm is robust to some extent : the switching timing and switching parameter values both allow flexibility .",
    "therefore , they do not need to be very precisely determined .",
    "hereafter the following notations will be used    let us denote by @xmath33 the set of all global attractors of @xmath32 , including attractive stable fixed points , limit cycles and chaotic ( possibly strange ) attractors ; @xmath34 the ordered set of the corresponding admissible values of @xmath10  and @xmath35 @xmath36 a finite ordered subset of @xmath37 containing @xmath38 different values @xmath10 , which determines the set of attractors @xmath39 .    *",
    "assumptions *    * a.2 .",
    "* @xmath37 is considered , as in most cases , to be composed of a single real interval and all the values of @xmath40for which the system behaves stable and/or chaotic is assumed to be accessible .",
    "* @xmath32 is dissipative i.e. @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    due to the assumed dissipativity",
    ", @xmath33 is non - empty and it follows naturally that for the considered class of systems , a bijection may be defined between the sets @xmath37 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , giving any @xmath43 , a unique global attractor is specified , and vice versa .    because in this paper computer simulations are used as the major analytical tool , the @xmath44-_limit set _ ( actually , its approximation @xcite ) is considered after neglecting a sufficiently long period of transients .",
    "therefore , by _ attractors _",
    "( background on the notion of attractor can be found in @xcite ) it is appropriate to understand in this paper the @xmath45-_limit set _ obtained by a numerical method for odes with fixed step size @xmath46 after the transients were neglected .",
    "let @xmath47 the as algorithm relies on the following deterministic time rule applied repeatedly on @xmath9 @xmath48 , \\label{scheme}%\\ ] ]    where the weights @xmath49are some positive integers .",
    "the algorithm acts as follow : in the first time subinterval of length @xmath50 , @xmath10 will have the value @xmath51(i.e .",
    "the ivp([ivpa])-([ivpb ] ) will be integrated @xmath52 steps for @xmath53 ) , for the next @xmath54 integration steps , @xmath55 and so on until the @xmath38-th time subinterval of length @xmath56 where @xmath57 and then the algorithm repeats . in order to simplify the notation in ( [ scheme ] ) , for a fixed step size @xmath46 , the scheme ( [ scheme ] ) will be denoted next @xmath58 .",
    "\\label{schema simpla}%\\ ] ]    for example , the scheme @xmath59   $ ] represents the infinite sequence of @xmath60 @xmath61which means that while the considered numerical method integrates ( [ ivpa])-([ivpb ] ) , @xmath62 switches in each @xmath63 time subinterval . in other words ,",
    "the numerical method will integrate ( [ ivpa])-([ivpb ] ) one step with @xmath64 then three times with @xmath65 then two steps with @xmath55 and so on .",
    "the as algorithm for the scheme ( [ schema simpla ] ) is presented in fig . 2      let us denote the _",
    "synthesized _ attractor obtained with as algorithm , via ( [ schema simpla ] ) , by @xmath66and by @xmath67 the _ averaged _ attractor corresponding to    @xmath68    next , the following notion is introduced    two attractors are considered to be _ identical _ if their underlying @xmath44-_limit sets _ coincide in the phase space , the identity being considered from a geometric point of view in the phase space , aided by computer graphic analysis .",
    "this identity in the case of chaotic attractors will be considered only asymptotically since they are fully depicted only after an infinite time .",
    "the synthesized attractor @xmath69 and the averaged attractor @xmath67 are identical    let us consider some subset @xmath70 . if we denote @xmath71 it is easy to see that @xmath72 is a convex combination @xmath73 since @xmath74 therefore @xmath72 belongs within the interval @xmath75 , whatever the values @xmath76 are chosen .",
    "also , taking into account the bijection between @xmath37 and @xmath33 , we are entitled to consider that the same convex structure is preserved into @xmath77 therefore , for whatever switched values of @xmath10 in some subset @xmath70 , @xmath69 will belong within the set @xmath78 @xmath79considered to be ordered by the mentioned bijection i.e. @xmath80 .  next , aided by numerical analysis and via computer graphics , it can be showed that @xmath69 is identical ( in the sense defined above ) to @xmath81therefore @xmath82    next , we can formulate the main property of the as algorithm    for whatever considered set @xmath70 , the as algorithm generates an attractor @xmath66which belongs to @xmath83    the as algorithm is useful especially when we want to obtain some attractor @xmath84even the underlying value @xmath85cannot be accessible .    in this case",
    "@xmath86 can be synthesized by choosing a corresponding set @xmath87 but @xmath88 and a corresponding scheme ( [ schema simpla ] ) .",
    "the initial conditions play an important role since for a specific value @xmath43 there is a single global attractor but which could be composed by several local attractors ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "for example , for the lorenz system for the control parameter @xmath89  there are three local attractors : the origin and two symmetrical fixed points @xmath90 ) while for @xmath91 there is a single local attractor which is global too , the known lorenz strange attractor . to avoid these possible difficulties , all the computer simulations for @xmath69 and @xmath67 for a particular case , start from the same initial conditions .",
    "in order to see how the as algorithm works , let us consider that we want to synthesize the attractor @xmath92    then we must choose @xmath38 and the set @xmath70 such that @xmath93 ( @xmath85can be equal or not to one of the elements @xmath94 for @xmath95 next , choosing empirically the scheme ( [ schema simpla ] ) , such that the right - hand side of ( [ p * ] ) gives @xmath96 the initial value problem is integrated and finally @xmath97 is obtained .    to underline the identity between @xmath69 and @xmath98histograms and poincar sections besides the phase plots were drawn after the transients were neglected .",
    "real neurons often display high nonlinearity , which has been shown in many experiments and confirmed by numerical simulation of many neuron models , including the hr and chay neuron models@xcite .",
    "chaos is a universal phenomenon in certain neurons , such as those in the human brain where , often , the information is decoded and transduced by means of chaos .",
    "it is very important to study the chaos of neuron from different aspects .",
    "next , we will focus on the neuronal firing pattern when @xmath10 is switched .",
    "firstly , it is easy to prove the following    the hr system ( [ hr ] ) with @xmath10 considered as control parameter , belongs to the class of systems modeled by the ivp ( [ ivpa])-([ivpb ] ) .    choosing the following substitution@xmath99 and replacing finally @xmath100 with @xmath101 ( [ hr ] ) becomes@xmath102 where@xmath103 thus , the right hand side of ( [ modified ivp ] ) can be written following ( [ ivpb ] ) with@xmath104{c}% a_{1}x_{1}^{3}+b_{1}x_{1}^{2}+c_{1}x_{1}+d_{1}x_{2}+e_{1}x_{3}+f_{1}+i\\\\ a_{2}x_{1}^{2}+b_{2}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2}+d_{2}\\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] @xmath105{ccc}% 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ s & 0 & -1 \\end{array } \\right ) \\text { \\rm and } x=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}% \\end{array } \\right )   .\\ ] ]        because , from a numerical point of view , the mathematical model ( [ hr ] ) presents a more accessible form than ( [ modified ivp ] ) ,  next we will work with ( [ hr ] ) .",
    "the hr system verifies the assumptions a1 , a2 and also a3 for large parameters range taking into account that @xmath106 therefore , one can apply the as algorithm to the hr system ( [ hr ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we considered the standard runge - kutta numerical method for odes with the fixed step size @xmath107 and , as stated above , @xmath108        for the sake of the brevity , in what follows , only the most relevant cases are considered .",
    "let us firstly consider the case @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "1b ) with @xmath111 then , using the scheme @xmath112 $ ] while integrating the initial value problem ( [ hr ] ) , finally , even the attractors @xmath113and @xmath114 are stable limit cycles , the obtained synthesized attractor @xmath69 is chaotic ( fig .",
    "3a ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3a , the synthesized attractor @xmath69 ( blue ) and the averaged attractor @xmath67 ( red ) for @xmath115 given by ( [ p * ] ) coincide .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "1b ) and also @xmath69 is situated between the corresponding attractors @xmath117 and @xmath118    next , if we use @xmath119 values for @xmath10 defined as follows : @xmath120and @xmath121 for @xmath122 the synthesized attractor @xmath69 is a stable limit cycle which coincides with the averaged attractor @xmath67 with @xmath123(fig .",
    "4 ) .    an interesting case appears for @xmath109 and @xmath124 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are chosen in a very narrow periodic window ( its width is about @xmath128 , see fig .",
    "1c , fig . 5b and fig .",
    "the obtained attractor , @xmath129 is identical to @xmath67 for @xmath130(fig .",
    "we found numerically that the fixed point @xmath131is unstable for @xmath132since the three eigenvalues are : @xmath133 and @xmath134 and , as showed in fig .",
    "6 , the lyapunov spectrum has two negative exponents while the maximum one is positive ( approximately zero ) .",
    "all these lead us to consider that @xmath67 ( and consequently @xmath135 is a stable limit cycle .",
    "the apparent difference between the attractors in this case is due to the very small difference between @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    "in summary , we have investigated the synthesis of attractors of the hr neuronal system by means of the as method .",
    "it is shown that when we choose the slow parameter @xmath12 as the control parameter , the hr neuronal system belongs to a class of systems , where we can apply the proposed switching method .",
    "consequently , we concluded that every attractor can be synthesized by the proposed periodic parameter switching scheme in the hr neuron model .",
    "it is accepted that neurons can code information by means of firing patterns , which depends on the variation of key parameters of neuronal systems .",
    "hence , the results presented in this paper may be instructive in understanding the implications of realistic neuronal dynamics .",
