    "being located two orders of magnitude closer than the nearest large galaxy , the galactic centre ( gc ) can be studied with much higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than is possible for other galaxies .",
    "because of this advantage , we can identify unique objects like the radio - arc consisting of linear parallel filaments ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "1984 ) , or the 2.6@xmath6 m@xmath7 black hole most probably associated with the compact radio source sgr  a * ( ghez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these studies have also established a concentration of gas , mostly in the form of molecular clouds characterised by densities @xmath810@xmath9 molecules @xmath10 , velocity dispersions @xmath810 km s@xmath11 , temperatures @xmath870 k and apparent magnetic fields @xmath81 mg in the region .",
    "most of these quantities are one to two orders of magnitude larger than those found in the disk of our galaxy .",
    "the review by morris & serabyn ( 1996 ) , describes this research .",
    "melia & falcke ( 2001 ) provide the recent advances made in the research on the black hole and the central region ( a few pc ) of the galaxy .",
    "the three - dimensional source distribution in the gc region is complex , and despite the studies mentioned above , identification of the objects and the physical processes operating in the region are difficult to understand , some of which we discuss below .    from the high - resolution ( @xmath8  arcsec ) observations with the vla at radio frequencies ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) , the following sources within the central 15@xmath0 of the galaxy have been identified or reconfirmed .",
    "( i ) at the dynamical centre of the galaxy is the compact nonthermal radio source known as sgr  a*. ( ii ) around sgr  a * is the hii region sgr  a  west , whose morphology resembles a face - on spiral galaxy .",
    "( iii ) near sgr  a  west is sgr  a  east , which is believed to be a supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "( iv ) a 7@xmath0 halo , which has been proposed to be a mixture of thermal and non - thermal emission ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "sgr  a * ( see melia & falcke 2001 for a review ) was not detected at frequencies below 960 mhz and observations at 408 mhz ( davies et al .",
    "1976 ) and at 330 mhz ( pedlar et al . 1989 ) provided upper limits ( @xmath120.1 jy at 330 mhz ) on its flux density .",
    "sgr  a * probably has a low frequency turnover below 1 ghz , but the nature of the turnover has never been examined in detail ( melia & falcke 2001 ) .",
    "recently , nord et al . (",
    "2004 ) claim to have detected sgr  a * at 330 mhz .",
    "however , their detection at 330 mhz remains provisional ( roy & rao 2004 ) .",
    "magnetic fields can be strong enough to have a significant influence on the dynamics and evolution of the sources in the central region of our galaxy .",
    "magnetic pressure can contribute significantly to the overall pressure balance of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and can even influence the scale height of the gas .",
    "it can affect the formation and motion of clouds and perhaps mediate in the star formation process ( beck et al . 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to measure the magnetic field geometry and strength in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "however , other than the central 200 pc region , no systematic study has been made to estimate the magnetic fields in the inner 5 kpc region of the galaxy ( davidson 1996 ) .",
    "the estimates within the central 200 pc region are mainly based on the observations of the non - thermal filaments or ntfs ( gray et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , if the ntfs are manifestations of a peculiar local environment ( shore & larosa 1999 ) , inferences drawn from these observations can be misleading .    here",
    "we describe ( i ) the 620 mhz gmrt observations of the gc , which was aimed at studying the low frequency spectrum and the location of sgr  a * with respect to sgr a west hii region , ( ii ) atca and vla observations of 65 background sources located in the central @xmath16@xmath2@xmath36@xmath2 , @xmath12@xmath2@xmath42@xmath2  region of the galaxy to measure faraday rotation measure ( rm ) , which could yield a model dependent magnetic field in the gc region .",
    "the 620 mhz observations of the gc were carried out with the gmrt with a nominal bandwidth of 16 mhz .",
    "full - synthesis ( @xmath87 hours ) observations were performed .",
    "absolute flux density calibration was performed using 3c48 and 3c286 data .",
    "the increase of @xmath13 from the calibrator field to the target source affects the source visibility amplitudes in the default observing mode ( i.e. the automatic level control ( alc ) in the system is turned on ) , and this was tackled by ( i ) multiplication of the target source data with ratio of total power ( when alcs were off ) between source and calibrator , or ( ii ) observations with alc off and using unnormalised cross - correlation data ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the data were processed within astronomical image processing system ( aips ) using standard programs .",
    "images of the fields were formed by fourier inversion and cleaning ( imagr ) .",
    "the initial images were improved by phase only self - calibration . to improve the deconvolution of the extended emission",
    ", we made the final image using multi - resolution clean ( wakker & schwarz 1988 ) .",
    "the gmrt map at 620 mhz ( fig",
    ".  1 ) has a dynamic range of about 150 , and is limited by systematics .",
    "a total of 37 sources were observed with the atca using their 4.8 ghz and 8.5 ghz bands .",
    "the atca observations were made using a 6  km array configuration .",
    "each target source was typically observed for a total of 4050 minutes . since we used an e - w array configuration , to get a satisfactory _ uv_-coverage each source",
    "was observed @xmath1410 times almost equally spaced in hour angle .",
    "calibration and editing of the atca data were performed using miriad .",
    "the calibrated visibilities were imaged using standard aips .",
    "we used the vla in its bna configuration to observe 27 relatively weak sources in the sample .",
    "the default continuum mode , with a single frequency channel of bandwidth 50 mhz in each if band was used .",
    "observations were centred at frequencies of 4.63 , 4.88 , 8.33 and 8.68 ghz .",
    "each source was observed for typically 5 minutes at 2 different hour angles .",
    "all the data were calibrated and processed using the aips package .",
    "the central 15@xmath0 region of the galaxy at 620 mhz is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the compact source sgr  a * , along with other well known sources like sgr a east and the 7@xmath0 halo are clearly seen . to compare the smaller - scale features near sgr  a  west with higher frequency maps",
    ", we have overlayed in fig .  2 , the 620 mhz map in gray scale on the 4.8 ghz vla map in contours convolved to a common resolution .",
    "there is almost one to one correspondence between the brighter emission features at 4.8 ghz comprising the sgr  a  west region and a drop in the total intensity at 620 mhz ( indicated by a white region seen along sgr a west ) , indicating that the thermal emission is optically thick near 620 mhz .",
    "while estimating the flux density of sgr  a * at 620 mhz , we reduced the confusion due to the extended emission by imaging only those visibilities having _ uv _ distance @xmath157 k@xmath16 .",
    "the flux density estimated from the image plane is about 0.5 @xmath170.1 jy .",
    "we note that even after applying a lower _ uv _ cutoff , there is significant background confusion within a beam of size 7.@xmath18 .",
    "this confusion causes an uncertainty of about 0.1 jy in the estimated flux density .",
    "although the high radio frequency spectrum of sgr  a * is well established , the spectrum below 1.4 ghz is not well estimated . at 1.4 ghz ,",
    "the flux density of sgr  a * is about 0.5 jy and its time averaged spectral index , @xmath19 defined as s@xmath20 , between 1.4 and 8.5 ghz is + 0.17 ( melia & falcke 2001 ) .",
    "davies et al .",
    "( 1976 ) found the flux density of sgr  a * at 960 mhz to be a factor of two less than at 1.6 ghz and suggested that it has a low frequency turnover around 1 ghz .",
    "this appears to be confirmed from their upper limit of 50 mjy at 408 mhz and the 100 mjy upper limit set by pedlar et al .",
    "( 1989 ) at 330 mhz . however , the present 620 mhz observations along with its tentative 330 mhz detection ( nord et al .",
    "2004 ) raise questions about earlier measurements . based on the average flux density of sgr  a * at 1.4 ghz ( zhao et al .",
    "2001 ) and its known spectrum between 1.4 and 8.5 ghz , we expect a flux density of 0.44 jy at 620 mhz , which is consistent with our measurements within the error - bars .",
    "therefore , at frequencies of a few ghz to 620 mhz , the observed spectral index of sgr  a * is nearly flat .    though the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model of emission from sgr  a * fails to explain the observed low frequency emission , adaf along with self - absorbed synchrotron emission either from a relativistic jet , or from a small relativistic fraction of electrons embedded in the accretion flow ( yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) could explain the observed spectrum of sgr  a * from x - ray ranges to low radio frequencies of about 620 mhz .      at 620 mhz",
    ", sgr  a  west shows evidence for free - free self - absorption . in roy & rao ( 2004 )",
    ", we have shown the optical depth of sgr a west hii region near sgr  a * to be 2.5@xmath170.5 .",
    "if sgr  a * was located behind sgr  a  west , then its flux density would have been attenuated by a factor of 10 due to thermal absorption by sgr a west .",
    "however , the spectral index of sgr  a * between 620 mhz and 1.4 ghz is roughly the same as between 1.4 ghz and 8.5 ghz showing no effect of free - free absorption by sgr  a  west .",
    "this indicates that sgr  a * is located in front of sgr  a  west .",
    "it is possible to invoke alternate scenarios like holes in sgr  a  west along the line of sight to sgr  a * , but these appear to be unlikely ( see roy & rao 2004 for details ) .",
    "based on the atca data , 24 sources were found to have at least one polarised component .",
    "the fwhm sizes of the beams in the atca 4.8 ghz images are @xmath146@xmath21 , and the typical rms noise is 0.23 mjy / beam in stokes i and about 0.15 mjy / beam in stokes q and u. of the sources observed using the vla , 21 have at least one polarised component .",
    "the vla images have a beam of fwhm size @xmath82@xmath22 and the rms noise is typically 75 @xmath23jy / beam . a map of one of the sources is presented in fig .  3 .      the estimated rm towards 45 sources are plotted in fig .",
    "5 . in the plot , the positive rms have been indicated by cross ( @xmath24 ) and the negative rms by a circle ( @xmath25 ) , where the size of the symbols increases linearly with the @xmath26rm@xmath26 .",
    "the region appears to be dominated by positive rm .",
    "the median value of the rms is estimated to be 467@xmath1787 rad m@xmath27 . to detect small - scale fluctuations in the rm ,",
    "we have plotted the rm structure function in fig .",
    "as can be seen from the plots , the rm structure function tends to zero as the separation of the polarised components tends to zero . since intrinsic rms of different sources",
    "are independent of their angular separations , our result supports an interstellar origin ( plasma turbulence ) of the rm towards the gc .",
    "the structure function tends to saturate for components separated by more than 0.@xmath23 . from the plot ,",
    "the coherence scale ( where the structure function attains half of its maximum value ) of the faraday screen is estimated to be about 0.@xmath22  ( 30 pc at a distance of 8.5 kpc ) .",
    "our observations show a large - scale positive bias in rm towards the gc , with a mean rm of 525@xmath17129 rad m@xmath27 towards the sources with positive galactic longitude , and 389@xmath17103 rad m@xmath27 towards the sources with negative galactic longitude .",
    "the absence of any reversal of sign of the rm ( 4@xmath28 result ) across the rotation axis of the galaxy ( @xmath29=0@xmath2 ) , indicates that the magnetic field across the rotation axis of our galaxy is not circularly symmetric .",
    "two models , the axisymmetric and the bisymmetric spiral model of the magnetic fields are generally invoked to explain the field geometry in galaxies ( beck et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is thought that current loop generated by rotation of the matter around the centre ( dynamo model ) gives rise to the axisymmetric spiral configuration of the magnetic field",
    ". however , if the magnetic fields at the present time are the result of concentration of a primordial magnetic field due to collapse of matter while the galaxy was formed , then it gives rise to the bisymmetric spiral configuration of the magnetic field in galaxies . in our galaxy ,",
    "the magnetic field configuration has been suspected to be bisymmetric ( simard - normandin & kronberg 1980 ) , in which case , the field does not undergo a reversal of sign across the centre .",
    "our observations support the bisymmetric spiral configuration in the inner parts of our galaxy .      in order to estimate the line of sight ( _",
    "los _ ) component of the magnetic fields from the rm , we need a model of the electron density in the region .",
    "based on the very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of the scattering diameter of extragalactic sources ( bower et al .",
    "2001 ) , we consider an electron density of 0.4 @xmath30 in the region , which is twice the value predicted by the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model for the inner galaxy .",
    "if the central 2  kpc is considered responsible for the faraday rotation , then the _ los _ averaged magnetic field is estimated to be 0.7 @xmath23 g ( roy , rao & subrahmanyan 2004 ) .    to compute the random component of the magnetic field",
    ", we note that the typical scale size of the faraday screen as estimated in @xmath313.3.1 is @xmath830 pc .",
    "hence , there will be about 70 cells of irregularities within the central 2  kpc of the galaxy .",
    "assuming that the rm contributions from the individual cells along the _ los _ are random about the mean , the cell contributions would have an rms rm value of 83 rad m@xmath32 .",
    "if the rms electron density within such a cell is 0.4 @xmath30 , the estimated magnetic field is about 9 @xmath23 g , which is more than an order of magnitude higher than its _ los _ average value .",
    "this small field raises doubts about an all - pervasive mg field in the central few hundred pc of the galaxy ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ) .",
    "the large - scale picture suggested by our observations is that the magnetic field even a few degrees away from the gc is oriented nearly perpendicular to the _ los _ pointing towards us on both sides of the gc .",

    "the automatic level control ( alc ) is a negative feedback device that keeps the output power of the antennas at the optimal levels .",

    "therefore , switching off the alcs avoids the problem .",
    "however , with alcs off , there can be sufficient output power to saturate the electronics system .",
    "therefore , system gains need to be adjusted in a way to avoid this problem .",
    "this is usually achieved by changing the amplitude gains of all the antennas using attenuators , so that the output power of all the antennas are equal to their default values . since",
    ", @xmath13 is maximum when the sky temperature is maximum , this needs to be performed while observing the strongest source .",
    "keeping visibility amplitudes free from above problem also requires data , where the cross - correlation coefficients between different antenna pairs are not normalised by the total power of the antennas . as shown in the appendix - b , it also avoids any possible change of bandshape due to change of sky temperature .",

    "as normalised visibilities are directly proportional to @xmath35 and inversely proportional to @xmath13 , it implies that the bandpass function is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "since the bandpass calibration is performed with a calibrator typically away from the galactic plane , the @xmath38 may be small and neglected in the denominator .",
    "however , @xmath38 is substantial while observing any source in the galactic plane at low radio frequencies ( @xmath391.4 ghz ) .",
