    "through lattice qcd simulations ( lqcd ) it is possible to study qcd at current quark masses which are not restricted to their physical values .",
    "data points obtained for such a scenario represent a powerful pool of information to fix free low - energy constants ( lecs ) of the ( baryon ) chiral perturbation theory ( b@xmath6pt ) ; lecs that also enter calculations for experimental observables .",
    "thus , adjusting the b@xmath6pt to lqcd data in the unphysical region allows for predictions at the physical point .",
    "in our study we performed such a matching for the quark - mass ( @xmath7 ) dependence of the nucleon mass @xmath8 .",
    "we fit lqcd data for the @xmath9 flavors , two light degenerated quarks , as well as for the @xmath10 ensembles , two light degenerated and one heavy quarks . here , we concentrate on our @xmath3 results and refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on the @xmath9 ones .    a measure of the contribution from the explicit chiral symmetry breaking to the nucleon mass is given by the so - called @xmath11-term .",
    "it is the nucleon scalar form factor at zero momentum transfer squared which can be isolated from @xmath12-scattering experiments .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath11 can also be obtained by the hellmann - feynman theorem from @xmath8 : @xmath13 as a result , the function @xmath8 , which has mainly unphysical values , connects lqcd , b@xmath6pt and experiment .",
    "the b@xmath6pt up to @xmath0 describes the nucleon mass by : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the pion mass and pion decay constant .",
    "we fit the three lecs @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 to lqcd data and obtain through eq .",
    "( [ eq : hf ] ) a @xmath11 value .",
    "explicit @xmath20 contributions can appear in the loop - contributions @xmath21 and we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for all technical details .",
    "generally , lqcd data is given in the dimensionless form @xmath22 where each collaboration sets its scale through a specific value for the lattice spacing @xmath23 . in the @xmath3 case",
    ", we fit the data after converting to physical units .",
    "since all three quantities are subject to statistical uncertainties , the @xmath23 uncertainty translates into a correlated uncertainty for the normalization of data points belonging to the same set .",
    "we take this correlation into account by defining a correlation matrix @xmath24 containing all these uncertainties , and minimize the function : @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the data and @xmath27 and @xmath28 the b@xmath6pt infinite volume nucleon mass and its finite volume corrections .",
    "the constants @xmath29 parametrize finite spacings effects for each lqcd - action separately in our @xmath1 b@xmath6pt analysis we only include @xmath3 lqcd data for which the strange quark mass is kept constant approximately at its phenomenological value .",
    "for this case the strange quark mass corrections to the nucleon mass can be seen as being integrated out into the lecs we are fitting .",
    "furthermore , to ensure controllable finite volume corrections and a reasonable chiral convergence of our results , we only account for data points with @xmath30 and @xmath31 mev , with @xmath32 being the lattice box size . following this , we include data from the bmw @xcite , hsc @xcite , lhpc @xcite , milc @xcite , nplqcd @xcite , pacs @xcite and rbcuk - qcd @xcite collaborations .",
    "fits . right : the blue - solid ( green - dashed ) line shows our result for the @xmath33 b@xmath6pt fit with(out ) @xmath20 contributions by excluding the two data points from the hsc and nplqcd collaborations . the red - dotted line is a b@xmath6pt fit with @xmath20",
    "including also this data .",
    "left : same results depicted for a smaller @xmath34 range.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] fits .",
    "right : the blue - solid ( green - dashed ) line shows our result for the @xmath33 b@xmath6pt fit with(out ) @xmath20 contributions by excluding the two data points from the hsc and nplqcd collaborations . the red - dotted line is a b@xmath6pt fit with @xmath20 including also this data .",
    "left : same results depicted for a smaller @xmath34 range.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    the fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] shows several b@xmath6pt fit strategies to the above listed @xmath3 lqcd data .",
    "we obtain consistent descriptions of the pion - mass dependence of the nucleon mass where the slope - variations are below the resolution of the current data . however , by looking to the pion - mass dependence of the @xmath11 term , left graph of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] , we observe that these small variations translate into noticeable changes . for successively including explicit @xmath20 contributions and finite spacing corrections in our fit formula , the @xmath11 term at the physical point changes by up to @xmath35 mev from @xmath36 mev to @xmath37mev down to @xmath38 mev",
    "in view of this , we take a conservative standpoint and give the following weighted average as our final @xmath3 @xmath11 value at the physical point : @xmath39 where the second ( systematical ) uncertainty spans all the above central values .    the right graph of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] compares our b@xmath6pt results from separate fits to lqcd data from @xmath9 and @xmath3 ensembles . also here , differences are within the spread and uncertainties of the input data but result in a slightly smaller @xmath11 value for the @xmath40 case : @xmath41 concerning the uncertainties , these two values are compatible , however , show a slight tension which we mostly trace back to the different data point distributions . on the one hand",
    ", the current @xmath9 data does not constrain the low-@xmath34 region as much as the @xmath3 data .",
    "this region is dominated by the lec @xmath17 which is the @xmath11 at leading order .",
    "consequently , we obtain by @xmath42 % different @xmath17-values with correspondingly different contributions to the total @xmath11 . on the other hand , in the @xmath9 case one direct data point @xcite of the @xmath11 at @xmath43 mev",
    "could be included in the fit .",
    "a positive outcome was that the above spread of our results with and without inclusion of @xmath20 contributions is lifted .",
    "since no such data point at low-@xmath34 is available for the @xmath3 case , a spread of @xmath44 mev remains .",
    "note that in the hb@xmath6pt formalism @xcite this spread is more than @xmath45 mev . to compare our above numbers also with phenomenology",
    ", we cite the latest value extracted from pure @xmath46-n scattering data : @xmath47 mev @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", we performed fits of the @xmath0 @xmath1 covariant b@xmath6pt with and without explicit @xmath20 contributions to lqcd nucleon mass data . even though the present data set is extensive , we spotted systematic effects coming mainly from the distribution of the data points .",
    "these systematic effects would further be reduced by new data for : a ) more @xmath9 data points in the low-@xmath34 region , b ) already one direct calculation of the @xmath11 at @xmath48 mev for the @xmath49 case .",
