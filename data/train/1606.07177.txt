    "the search for new exact solutions to the einstein field equations ( efe ) and their physical interpretation have been a fascinating pursuit since the first days of general relativity . due to the nonlinearity of the efe",
    "it is often necessary to resort to assuming some symmetries on the solution .",
    "most of the solutions that have been derived so far are discussed and classified in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive a new analytic solution of the efe admitting a @xmath0 ( i.e. , a one dimensional ) group of motions with a non - null killing vector field ( kvf ) and whose matter source is a perfect fluid obeying the ideal equation of state characterizing stiff matter .",
    "solutions in vacuum are discussed in page 271 of @xcite , while exact @xmath0 solutions with a null kvf are summarized in page 379 of the same book .",
    "senovilla and sopuerta  @xcite found some petrov type d @xmath0 solutions with a non - null kvf .",
    "these were generalized by koutras and mars  @xcite , and are also of petrov type d. see also  @xcite . ]",
    "we will use the geroch transformation to generate the new solution @xcite , show that it admits only one kvf , and demonstrate its spike crossing properties .",
    "since the spike is persisting close to the initial singularity our solution constitutes an explicit example in which the belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) locality conjecture  @xcite does not apply  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after a review about the solution - generating geroch transformation , we apply it to two seed solutions with stiff fluid  the hyperbolic friedmann - lemaitre ( fl ) solution and a spatially homogeneous but anisotropic bianchi type v solution .",
    "we will then compare these two solutions in the late - time regime .",
    "we then analyze the mathematical and physical properties of the latter solution .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion .",

    "we know that the fl seed is just a particular subclass of the bv seed and that both spacetimes tends to the milne spacetime at late times ; we now want to understand if this is also the case for the transformed metrics .",
    "we will not consider the metric tensors themselves , but a set of scalar curvature invariants that can be derived from them and some related appropriately defined hubble - normalized scalars .",

    "indeed , ( i ) the transformed solutions do not isotopize since @xmath55 asymptotes to a non - zero constant value at late times , ( ii ) the solutions approach the same vacuum solution at late times anisotropically ( in that the comoving matter is shearing ) , and ( iii ) the asymptotic late time vacuum state is not milne since its weyl tensor is non - zero .",
    "we also checked explicitly that the gauss contraint ^3 r=2- 23 ^2 + 2 ^ 2 is satisfied during all the time evolution .",
    "in this section we will discuss in more detail some of the physical and mathematical properties of the new exact solution of the efe we derived in the fourth section of this manuscript .    to look for a spiky behavior of the new metric we must consider the inhomogeneity parameter , where @xmath56 and @xmath9 are given by equations ( [ lambdab ] ) and ( [ omegab ] ) above . usually a spike occurs at the place where @xmath57 as @xmath56 becomes small . in this case",
    "spikes form along the planes @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with a spike intersection on the line @xmath60 . in ( [ omegab ] ) then spikes form along two hyperbolic cylinders @xmath61 , and do not intersect . ] as @xmath62 towards the singularity , , which is discontinuous on the intersection @xmath60 .",

    "we need three invariants such that the system of equations ( [ invariant_v ] ) yields trivial solutions for the @xmath72 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 components of @xmath71 .",

    "we then evaluate the jacobian matrix at an arbitrary point , say @xmath78 , and compute the determinant of the matrix .",
    "the determinant is non - zero , and so the system yields trivial solution for the @xmath72 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 components of @xmath71 .",

    "in contrast to previous petrov type d @xmath0 solutions with non - null kvf , the new solution presented here is of the most general petrov type i. in order to demonstrate this we simply note that the asymptotic form of the early - time attractor , which is a jacobs stiff fluid solution , is of petrov type i , and hence the new solution must also be of petrov type i.",
    "in this paper we have derived a new @xmath0 stiff fluid solution , described in terms of elementary functions .",
    "it is of mathematical interest since it is the first explicit solution to show interesting spike crossings , which completes and complements the physical discussion started @xcite where an original @xmath79 solution was found .",
    "future investigations of this new solution will deal with a deeper analysis of the spike crossing phenomenon and its relationship to the structure formation problem in late time cosmology .",
    "it is a general feature of solutions of partial differential equations that spikes occur  @xcite .",
    "spikes occur in generic solutions of the efe of general relativity  @xcite . indeed , when a self - similar solution of the efe is unstable , spikes can arise near such solutions .",

    "numerical evidence has been presented  @xcite that spikes in the mixmaster regime of @xmath79 cosmologies are transient and recurring , supporting the conjecture that the generalized mixmaster behavior is asymptotically non - local where spikes occur , leading to a violation of bkl locality at exceptional ( non - generic ) spacetime points .",
    "scalar fields are ubiquitous in the early universe in modern theories of theoretical physics . in the approach to the singularity",
    "the scalar field is dynamically massless @xcite . thus including massless scalar fields in early universe cosmology",
    "is important .",
    "the efe of a minimally coupled scalar field with a timelike gradient are formally the same as those of an irrotational stiff perfect fluid .",

    "we investigated the imprint of spikes on matter and structure formation in the massless scalar field / stiff perfect fluid models in @xcite .",
    "both the incomplete spikes and the recurring spikes , related to self - similar solutions such as the kasner solution and the fl model , may also occur at late times , and may also cause spikes that might lead to further matter inhomogeneities , albeit non - generically , which might lead to the existence of exceptional structures on large scales .",
    "permanent spikes in ltb models were studied in @xcite . in future work",
