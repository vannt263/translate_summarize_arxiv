    "an experiment reported in 1981 @xcite measured quantum noise in a resistively shunted josephson junction . the high frequency noise ( both thermal and quantum ) in the resistor",
    "is mixed down to measurable frequencies by the non - linearity of the josephson circuit .",
    "this experiment raised some important questions of principle .",
    "quantum noise is not directly measurable , but it may have measurable effects in non - equilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "the experiment has , controversially , been related to the question of `` dark energy '' @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the experiment involves a quantum langevin equation ( eq . below ) , and the status of this equation has been critically analyzed by one of us @xcite .",
    "the existence of such an equation has been demonstrated but only in a simple independent - oscillator model @xcite .    in the experiment @xcite ,",
    "a resistor @xmath0 is put in parallel with a josephson junction at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the critical current for the junction is @xmath2 and a bias current @xmath3 is applied .",
    "the voltage across the junction is @xmath4 , and noise fluctuations in this voltage are measured .",
    "the junction has capacitance @xmath5 .",
    "four different junctions were used with slightly different values of the parameters . as an example , for junction 2 , @xmath6 pf , @xmath7 ma , @xmath8 ma , @xmath9 @xmath10 , and one temperature for which details are given was @xmath11 k. the noise is measured at frequency 183 khz .",
    "the theory of the josephson circuit is particularly simple if the capacitance @xmath5 can be neglected . in @xcite",
    "a simple assumption is made about the dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "one of the motivations for this paper is to test the validity of this assumption .",
    "we find significant deviations for some values of the voltage .",
    "our results should be useful if experiments of a similar kind are performed in the future .",
    "our purpose here is to study the solutions of this langevin equation , and to derive the josephson frequency and the generalized impedances and hence predict the voltage noise strength . in the interpretation of the experiment @xcite , certain approximations were made , and we examine the validity of these approximations .",
    "we use two forms of perturbation theory , and also numerical methods .",
    "a mechanical model for the dynamics of the langevin equation ( equation below ) has been studied experimentally and theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the fundamental theoretical input @xcite is the quantum version of the nyquist fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( originally derived in @xcite ) . in the present context",
    ", it relates the current noise in the resistor at temperature @xmath1 to the conductance @xmath12 , and states @xmath13 = \\left(\\frac{2\\hbar\\omega}{r}\\right)\\coth\\left[\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2t}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath14 @xmath15 being the fourier transform of the current noise @xmath16 in the resistor , and the expectation value @xmath17 is with respect to a thermal distribution at temperature @xmath1 ( where we use units such that boltzmann s constant is 1 ) .",
    "the right hand side of has the finite limit @xmath18 as @xmath19 , and this offers the possibility to measure quantum noise .",
    "for this it is essential to have the symmetrized version of @xmath20 ; the unsymmetrized @xmath21 itself has a vanishing low - temperature limit for @xmath22 .",
    "this reflects the impossibility of getting energy directly out of the vacuum .",
    "it is , of course , essential that @xmath23 is a quantum , non - commuting , operator .",
    "the right hand side of contains the distribution function for a quantum oscillator of frequency @xmath10 at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "however , as emphasized in @xcite , this by no means implies that the resistor contains oscillators , or even that the system is bosonic .",
    "the second theoretical input is the assumed quantum langevin equation , connecting the voltage and voltage noise to the current and current noise in the shunted josephson circuit : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the josephson phase ( including noise ) and @xmath5 is the capacitance of the junction . since @xmath23 is a quantum operator , @xmath25 must be also .",
    "the status of this equation is less secure than that of ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the voltage @xmath4 across the junction is given by @xmath26 we will always assume that @xmath3 .",
    "then , in the absence of the noise @xmath23 , the solutions @xmath27 of settle down , after the decay of transients , to a periodic dependence on time , with frequency @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .",
    "the arbitrary constant @xmath31 is included in order to make explicit the infinite set of solution depending on the initial condition ( although is a second order equation , the initial value of @xmath32 is not an independent initial condition for the steady periodic solution ) .    on the right of , the current noise @xmath23 is certainly a quantum operator , but @xmath33 is presumably a classical quantity . since @xmath23 is small , we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ( classical ) solution and @xmath36 is the small quantum noise",
    ". then the latter obeys , to a good approximation , the linear quantum equation @xmath37 in which @xmath38 is a @xmath39-number coefficient .",
    "because of , there is a fourier series ( we use @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) @xmath42 with @xmath43 an integer and @xmath44 .",
    "we define a hybrid fourier integral / series by @xmath45\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath25 and @xmath46 .",

    "we assume that there is a non - zero limit @xmath52\\equiv \\frac{2e}{\\hbar } z_k.\\ ] ] so that ( by ) @xmath53 this is certainly true for @xmath54 @xcite , and also consistent with our conclusions in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we have not made explicit the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath51 , @xmath50 and @xmath55 , but it follows from , , and that @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "we define a periodic function @xmath57 associated with @xmath23 by @xmath58 and similarly for @xmath59 then , for the purpose of computing the @xmath60 defined in it is sufficient to use @xmath61 and @xmath59 .",
    "the basic problem is to obtain from and information about the voltage noise ( using ) .",
    "one approach to this problem @xcite is to simulate the current noise numerically , but it is not clear how to do this consistently with the frequency dependence in . also , the noise is supposed to be a quantum operator .",
    "our method is indirect .",
    "we first obtain the impedances @xmath60 defined in . since these are assumed to be classical quantities ( this is the consequence of the assumed existence of a quantum langevin equation with _ classical _ coefficients in it ) , to find them it is sufficient to take the noise in to be classical .",
    "having found the impedances @xmath60 , we can use ( with quantum noise ) together with to determine the strength of the ( quantum ) voltage noise .",
    "an advantage of this method is that is exactly respected .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to study the solutions of equation and , and the calculation of @xmath62 and @xmath60 .",
    "this enables us to check the validity of some of the approximations made in @xcite . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we use perturbation theory for small @xmath5 .",
    "this turns out to be a series in @xmath63 , and we are able to calculate the @xmath64 contribution to @xmath62 , and to @xmath60 but for @xmath65 only . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "we use perturbation theory in @xmath66 .",
    "again , there are only even terms , but we calculate @xmath67 contributions to @xmath62 and to @xmath60 . but this approximation is not useful for the values of @xmath33 in the experiments . in section [ sec6 ] , we give results of numerical calculations of @xmath62 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for several values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( dimensionless parameters defined in and below ) .",
    "we differ from some other numerical work @xcite in that we do not attempt to simulate the actual noise ( which should be consistent with ) , but just determine the @xmath60 factors .",
    "our conclusions are given in graphs , which may be useful in the interpretation of experiments .",
    "one particular conclusion is that , in the range @xmath72 ( with @xmath70 defined as in below ) @xmath73 decreases and @xmath68 increases . in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we show by what factors the values of @xmath74 and of @xmath75 are predicted to change between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "as we shall discuss , these ratios are new corrections to the predicted voltage noise .",
    "we conclude that the apparent quantitative agreement between theory and observation in @xcite may not be as good as it appears .",
    "certainly , our calculations should be relevant to any future repetition of this type of experiment .",
    "for another possible applications of equation , see ref . @xcite .",
    "it is useful to define the dimensionless variables @xmath78 in terms of these variables , and denoting @xmath79 by @xmath80 , equation becomes in the absence of the current noise @xmath81    in the special case when @xmath70 is negligible , this equation is easily soluble .",
    "a particularly convenient form of a solution is @xmath82 where in general @xmath83 is the natural frequency of the solutions of ( when transient decaying terms have died out ) , and @xmath84 is the value in this approximation ( @xmath85 ) : @xmath86 similarly , @xmath87 denotes the solution of when @xmath76 . in this case",

    "we note from that the quantity @xmath108 in depends upon the magnitudes of the ratios @xmath109 .",
    "this section is about the calculation of the josephson frequency ; it is not concerned with noise , so all variables are classical ones .",
    "since @xmath70 in equation has modest values in the experiments @xcite , one might expect perturbation theory in @xmath70 to be useful .",
