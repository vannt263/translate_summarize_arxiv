    "jets are remnants of hard - scattered partons , which are the fundamental objects of pqcd . at rhic",
    ", they can be used as a probe of the hot and dense matter created in heavy ion collisions  @xcite . to quantify the signals observed in heavy ion collisions in comparison to p+p collisions , it is necessary to measure the cold nuclear matter effects in systems such as d+au .",
    "there are several ways to describe cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "partonic rescattering  @xcite leads to @xmath0 broadening and to modification of jet @xmath1 spectra .",
    "nuclear parton distribution functions  @xcite influence jet @xmath1 spectra , but the effects at mid - rapidity are not expected to be very strong .",
    "this analysis is based on @xmath2 p+p and d+au data from the star experiment , recorded during rhic run 8 ( 2007 - 2008 ) .",
    "the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) detector is used to measure the neutral component of jets , and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) detector is used to measure the charged component of jets . in the case of a tpc track pointing to a bemc tower , its momentum is subtracted from the tower energy to avoid double counting ( electrons , mip and possible hadronic showers in the bemc ) . to reduce possible bemc backgrounds , the jet neutral energy fraction is required to be within @xmath3 .",
    "an upper @xmath4 cut was applied to tpc tracks due to uncertainties in tpc tracking performance at high-@xmath1 in run 8 ( under further investigation ) .",
    "the beam beam counter detector , located in the au nucleus fragmentation region , was used to select the 20% highest multiplicity events in d+au collisions .",
    "the acceptance of tpc and bemc together with experimental details ( calibration , primary vertex position cuts ) limit the jet fiducial acceptance to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the resolution parameter used in jet finding .",
    "recombination jet algorithms kt and anti - kt from the fastjet package  @xcite are used for jet reconstruction . to subtract the background , a method based on active jet areas  @xcite",
    "is applied event - wise : @xmath7 , with @xmath8 estimating the background density per event and @xmath9 being the jet active area . due to the asymmetry of the colliding d+au system ,",
    "the background is asymmetric in @xmath10 .",
    "this dependence was fit with a linear function in @xmath10 and included in the background subtraction procedure .",
    "to study detector effects , pythia 6.410 and geant detector simulations were used .",
    "jet reconstruction was run at mc hadron level ( pymc ) and at detector level ( pyge ) . to study effects of the d+au background ,",
    "a sample with added background ( pybg ) was created by mixing pyge events with 0 - 20% highest multiplicity d+au events ( minimum bias online trigger ) .",
    "azimuthal correlations of jets in di - jet events in p+p and d+au can provide information on nuclear @xmath0 broadening . to increase di - jet yield , bemc high tower ( ht ) online trigger was required ( one tower with @xmath11 ) , for both p+p and d+au . a cut @xmath12 applied for tracks and towers to reduce background and the jet finding",
    "was run with @xmath13 .    to select a clean di - jet sample two highest energy jets ( @xmath14 ) in each event were used , with @xmath15 .",
    "observed di - jet signal in d+au collisions is shown in figure  [ fig : dphi ] .",
    "distributions of @xmath16 were constructed for di - jets and gaussian widths , @xmath17 , were obtained for the two jet algorithms and two ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) @xmath20 bins .",
    "figure  [ fig : ktsimu ] shows that the widths are similar for pymc , pyge and pybg distributions , therefore detector and background effects are negligible , due to the interplay between jet @xmath1 and @xmath21 resolutions . figure  [ fig : ktdata ] shows an example of the @xmath22 distributions for data .",
    "the gaussian fit to p+p data is not ideal and the precise shape of the distribution is under study .",
    "rms widths of these distributions have therefore been checked and they agree with the sigma widths of the fits .",
    "the values extracted from the gaussian fits are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "possible nuclear @xmath0 broadening therefore seems rather small .",
    "the systematic errors on @xmath17 coming from a weak dependence on the @xmath25 cut for back - to - back di - jet selection ( varied between 0.5 and 1.0 ) and differences between the various selections ( @xmath20 range , jet algorithm ) are estimated to be @xmath26 .",
    "additional uncertainty comes from jet energy scale ( jes ) , which will be discussed in more detail in section  [ systematics ] .",
    "distributions of @xmath16 for simulation ( @xmath27 ) . ]",
    "distributions of @xmath16 for simulation ( @xmath27 ) . ]",
    "10 m 0 - 20% highest multiplicity d+au events with a minimum bias online trigger were used for this study .",
    "anti - kt algorithm was used with @xmath28 , @xmath29 cut was applied to tracks and towers .",
    "the jet @xmath1 spectrum is normalized per event and the high multiplicity of d+au events also guarantees the trigger efficiency is independent of the @xmath1 of the hard scattering .",
    "therefore , no correction related to trigger is needed for jet @xmath1 spectra .",
    "a bin - by - bin correction is used to correct for detector effects ( tracking and tower efficiency , unobserved neutral energy , jet @xmath1 resolution ) .",
    "it is based on the generalized efficiency , constructed as the ratio of pymc to pybg jet @xmath1 spectra .",
    "these correction factors are then applied to measured jet @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "as the detector effects on jet @xmath1 spectrum differ substantially depending on jet @xmath1 spectrum shape , the shapes have to be consistent between pybg and measured jet @xmath1 spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "as the jet @xmath1 spectrum is very sensitive to the jet energy scale , an additional correction was applied here to account for the lower tpc tracking efficiency in d+au compared to that from the used p+p pythia simulation .",
    "the d+au efficiency was determined by simulating single pions and embedding them at the raw detector level into real d+au minimum bias events .",
    "the tracking efficiency in the pythia simulation was then artificially lowered , prior to jet finding at pyge and pybg level , so that it matches the one obtained from d+au embedding .    to compare per event jet yield in d+au to jet cross section in p+p collisions , an input from mc glauber study is needed . in the following ,",
    "we have used @xmath30 for 0 - 20% highest multiplicity d+au collisions and @xmath31 .",
    "these factors were used to scale p+p jet cross section measured previously by the star collaboration  @xcite using mid point cone ( mpc ) jet algorithm with @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting d+au jet @xmath1 spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] together with scaled p+p jet spectrum . within systematic uncertainties",
    ", the d+au jet spectrum shows no significant deviation from the scaled p+p spectrum .",
    "the discrepancy between simulation and embedding was only discovered after the d+au spectrum was presented in the conference , and it was corrected only for these proceedings .",
    "the difference is however smaller than the combined systematic and statistical uncertainties , the conclusions therefore remain the same .",
    "the jes uncertainty dominates the uncertainties of d+au measurement and is marked by the black lines in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "it has two components : 5% on the neutral jet component ( bemc calibration uncertainty ) and 10% on the charged jet component ( uncertainty of tpc tracking efficiency in jets in d+au collisions ) .",
    "embedding of jets into real d+au events at raw detector level will allow to decrease this uncertainty in the future .",
    "as jes uncertainty is expected to be largely correlated between run 8 p+p and d+au data , we plan to measure jet @xmath1 spectrum in run 8 p+p collisions to decrease these uncertainties and be able to construct jet @xmath32 .",
    "caution is needed due to the use of different jet algorithms and different pseudorapidity acceptances in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "although neither of these effects can change our conclusion , the same algorithm and the same acceptance have to be used in p+p and d+au to construct jet @xmath32 .",
