    "properly describing the pm surface motion requires taking into account both the plasma electron and ion dynamics .",
    "the response time of electrons to the laser field is much smaller than the optical period , while ions react on a longer time scale due to their larger mass .",
    "akin to the born - oppenheimer approximation in molecular physics , this makes it possible to model the system in three steps : ( i ) we first describe the quasi - instantaneous response of electrons to the laser field , considering a given ion background ( fig.[sim1](a ) ) ; ( ii ) we then calculate the slow ion motion , resulting from the combined actions of the laser - field and of the charge separation fields it induces ( fig.[sim1](b ) ) and ( iii ) finally the influence of the slow dynamics on the fast one is included , to determine the surface motion over the entire laser pulse ( fig.[sim1](c ) ) .",
    "the derivations of all formulas and their validation by particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations are provided in the online supplementary information .",
    "qualitatively , the plasma electrons respond to the laser field as a spring , being alternatively pushed inside , and pulled outside of the ion background in each optical period  @xcite .",
    "when pulled outward , they form relativistic electron jets ( red arrow in fig.[sim1](a ) ) , that are responsible for the rom attosecond pulse emission . when pushed inward , a high - density spike is formed at the sharp surface of the electron distribution ( green arrow in fig.[sim1](a ) ) , at a position @xmath11 ( fig.[sim1](e - f ) ) . a detailed analysis of pic simulations ( see supplementary information ) shows that the position of the outgoing electron jet responsible for the emission of an attosecond pulse in each laser cycle is tied to the position of the high - density spike formed in this compression phase , and thus follows the same evolution as the laser intensity changes in time or space .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the value of @xmath11 , which can be easily determined by the balance between the pushing force exerted by the laser field , and the restoring force exerted by the ion background . in the relativistic regime",
    ", this balance leads to the following expression for the maximum inward excursion @xmath12 of electrons in a given optical period : @xmath13 \\label{xe}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the angle of incidence of the laser on the pm , and @xmath15 is the critical plasma density at the laser frequency .",
    "@xmath16 is the ion charge density at the ion - vacuum boundary ( fig.[sim1](e - f ) ) , i.e. the density from which the laser field starts pushing electrons inside the ion background . for this derivation ,",
    "the ion density gradient at the pm surface has been assumed to be exponential beyond @xmath16 , with a scale length @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 for @xmath19 ( fig.[sim1](e - f ) ) .",
    "@xmath17 is a crucial parameter of the interaction , which in particular strongly affects the hhg efficiency  @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 increases for larger values of @xmath17 in eq.([xe ] ) , because the laser field can more easily push electrons inside a smoother ion background .",
    "the electron boundary displacement @xmath12 also increases with @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] , the amplitude of the normalized vector potential of the incident laser field : the higher this amplitude , the further electrons get pushed inside the target . for a focused laser pulse ,",
    "the field envelop is a function of both time and space , @xmath21 .",
    "the spatial envelop results in an overall spatial curvature -a denting- of the plasma electron density surface .",
    "this laser - cycle - averaged curvature is clearly observed on a spatial map of electron density at @xmath22 corresponding to the laser pulse maximum ( fig.[sim1](a ) ) .",
    "it is very well reproduced by the curve @xmath23 $ ] deduced from eq.([xe ] ) and can be attributed to the spatially - inhomogenous ponderomotive force exerted by the laser field .    as for the temporal evolution",
    "@xmath11 associated to the laser pulse temporal envelop , the prediction of eq.([xe ] ) is shown as a red dashed line in fig.[sim1](d ) , in the case of a fixed ion background : electrons move back to their initial position in the falling edge of the laser pulse , due to their immediate response to the field @xmath24 ( eq.(1 ) ) and the restoring force from the ion background .",
    "however , this temporal evolution will be affected when ion motion is taken into account , because @xmath16 then becomes a slow function of time in eq.([xe ] ) .",
    "the second step of our model aims at determining @xmath25 .",
    "the charge separation induced by the laser field between the electron and ion populations leads to a quasi - electrostatic field in the plasma , which peaks around @xmath12 and tends to accelerate the ion population located around this position  @xcite .",
    "this acceleration expels the ions from this location , which results in an erosion of the ion density gradient in time .",
    "the position @xmath26 of the ion - vacuum boundary thus drifts inward during the laser pulse , and the density @xmath27 increases in time ( fig.[sim1](e - f ) ) .",
    "the so - called hole boring velocity @xmath28 of the ion surface can be calculated by writing a momentum flux balance @xcite .",
    "the reflection of the laser beam corresponds to a change in momentum of the field , which is compensated by an opposite change in momentum of the plasma particles . to determine how the light momentum is shared between electrons and ions",
    ", we use the same approach as developed independently in @xcite , i.e. we also write the energy flux balance , assuming that the absorbed laser intensity @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the plasma reflection coefficient for the laser ) is entirely carried away by electrons .",
    "the combination of these two balances leads to : @xmath31 with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are respectively the average charge state and mass number of the ions , @xmath35 is the proton mass and @xmath36 is the electron mass .",
    "the prediction of this equation for @xmath37 at the laser pulse maximum @xmath22 is shown as a blue line in fig.[sim1](b ) , and fits well the surface of the superimposed ion density map obtained from a pic simulation with mobile ions .",
    "the derivation of eq.([xpl ] ) shows that this curvature of the ion surface is induced by the spatially - inhomogeneous laser radiation pressure on the pm .",
    "the temporal evolution @xmath38 is represented in fig.[sim1](d ) by the blue line .",
    "as opposed to @xmath12 , the ion boundary displacement @xmath26 does not return to its initial value at the end of the pulse .",
    "this is because @xmath26 depends on the time integral of @xmath39 ( see eq.([xpl ] ) , where @xmath39 corresponds to the envelop of the laser field ) , meaning that it is the cumulated action of the laser field over time that is responsible for the ion dynamics .",
    "this results in a progressive change in the ion profile , which in turn affects the electrons dynamics .",
    "this coupling is included in our model in a very simple way .",
    "due to the erosion of the ion density profile , the laser field now starts pushing the electrons inside the ion background directly from @xmath38 , instead of @xmath40 initially .",
    "consequently , the position of the electron boundary @xmath41 when ion motion is taken into account is now given by @xmath42 ( see fig.[sim1](f ) ) . in this equation ,",
    "the value of @xmath11 is also affected by ion motion , because the restoring force induced by the ions initially located between @xmath43 and @xmath38 is suppressed . as explained before",
    ", this second effect is accounted for simply by using @xmath44 in eq.([xe ] ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of the electron boundary resulting from these coupled dynamics is illustrated in fig.[sim1](c ) .",
    "an excellent agreement is obtained between the pic simulation and the prediction of the full model ( black dots ) .",
    "an extensive parametric study of the surface dynamics , using hundreds of pic simulations , confirms the excellent accuracy ( @xmath45 ) of this model over a broad range of physical conditions ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "figure [ sim1](d ) uses our model to highlight the relative contributions of ion and electron dynamics in the case of the simulation of fig.[sim1](c ) . despite the brevity of the pulse ,",
    "the influence of ion motion on the position @xmath46 of the electron boundary becomes significant in the second part of the pulse ( beyond @xmath47 ) .",
    "its main effect is to prevent the electron boundary from moving back to its initial position in the falling edge of the laser pulse , which has observable consequences in experiments , as we will see later .",
    "as expected intuitively , the influence of ion dynamics on the total pm surface motion is predicted to become more and more significant as the laser pulse duration increases ( fig .",
    "[ sim2 ] ) .",
    "the laser - induced denting of the pm leads to a curvature of the wavefronts of the reflected light beam , which tends to focus this beam -including the harmonics generated upon reflection- in front of the surface @xcite .",
    "this is clearly observed in fig.[sim3 ] on the attosecond pulse train generated by the rom mechanism , which is focused at a distance @xmath48 from the surface , with a magnification ratio @xmath49 .",
    "this focusing of the beam naturally tends to increase its divergence . assuming a gaussian intensity profile of width @xmath50 for the @xmath51 harmonic in the source plane , this divergence is given by ( see supplementary information ) :",
    "@xmath53 is the pm dimensionless focusing parameter for the @xmath51 harmonic , that characterizes the effect of the pm curvature on all spatial properties of the reflected beam : @xmath54 with @xmath55 the harmonic wavelength . here",
    "@xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 ( fig.[sim3](left ) ) , i.e. it is the difference between the surface position at the center of the focal spot @xmath58 , and its position at @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 the half spatial width at @xmath61 of the laser field amplitude ) . in eq.[thetan ] , @xmath62 is the divergence that would be obtained in the absence of surface curvature , i.e. imposed by diffraction from the source plane .",
    "it can be expressed as a function of laser divergence @xmath63 .    in eq.([thetan ] ) , each term of @xmath64 corresponds to a different physical limit . if @xmath65 ( e.g. @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) , surface curvature has a negligible effect on the spatial properties , which are determined only by the beam diffraction from the source plane . on the opposite , if @xmath68 , the focusing induced by the pm imposes the beam divergence , leading to @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath53 is in principle a function of time .",
    "however , our model shows that after a fast transient of less than five laser periods only , @xmath70 and hence @xmath53 weakly vary in time ( black dots in fig.[sim1](d ) ) . as a first approximation",
    ", we therefore neglect its temporal variation in our study of the spatial properties of the reflected beam .",
    "this model for the reflected beam properties has been successfully compared with a series of 2d pic simulations ( see supplementary information ) . in the interaction conditions corresponding to the present state of the art of femtosecond lasers ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 )",
    ", it predicts @xmath73 ( 80 nm for @xmath74 nm ) and @xmath75 typically .",
    "the effect of surface curvature thus already becomes significant for harmonic orders @xmath76 .",
    "we now turn to an experimental investigation of the spatial properties of such harmonics , to validate the model , and show what insight it provides on hhg , and more generally on the physics of plasma mirrors .",
    "the experiment was performed on the uhi100 laser of iramis ( cea , france ) , that delivers 25 fs pulses with a peak power of up to 100 tw and an ultrahigh temporal contrast ( see methods section ) .",
    "this beam was focused in @xmath77-polarization to a spot size of 4 @xmath78 on a silica target , reaching an estimated peak intensity of @xmath79 @xmath2 ( @xmath80 ) , thus producing a relativistic plasma mirror .",
    "the density gradient scale length @xmath17 at the pm surface was varied by using a small controlled prepulse , intense enough to create a plasma ( @xmath81 @xmath2 ) at an adjustable delay @xmath82 ( @xmath83 @xmath84 ) before the main pulse .",
    "the value of @xmath17 was determined experimentally using time - resolved interferometry @xcite .      under these conditions ,",
    "high - order harmonics are produced in the reflected beam by the rom mechanism @xcite , and two diagnostics were used to characterize the spatial properties of the resulting harmonic beam in the far field ( see fig.[exp1](a - b ) and methods section ) .",
    "the spectrally - resolved divergence , extracted from images such as shown in fig.[exp1](a ) , is presented in fig.[exp1](c - d ) as a function of harmonic order and of the density gradient @xmath17 at the pm surface .",
    "the full lines show the results of the model .",
    "the only two unknowns of the model are the plasma reflectivity @xmath30 ( used only to calculate the ionic contribution to the surface curvature ) , and the ratio of harmonic and laser source size @xmath85 ( used to deduce the harmonic divergence from the surface curvature ) .",
    "these are however not used as free parameters to fit the data , but are directly extracted from 2d pic simulations performed in the physical conditions of the experiment ( see methods section ) .",
    "this provides @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the @xmath88 harmonic .",
    "parametric studies ( see supplementary information ) show that these values hardly change over a broad range of interaction conditions ( @xmath39 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "in addition , we note that @xmath30 hardly influences the results , since it only affects ion motion and appears in a square - root in eq.2 .",
    "these curves are in remarkable agreement with the measurements , thus validating the model and showing it can be used to gain insight on the physics involved in this experiment .",
    "note that this agreement was obtained without introducing any additional ` intrinsic phase ' @xmath89 , such as the one described by an der brgge et al @xcite .",
    "our model actually suggests that this phase is simply given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the electron denting provided by eq.([xe ] ) , and is thus implicitly included in our analysis .",
    "this expression exactly predicts the scaling of @xmath89 obtained in @xcite for normal incidence and a step - like plasma surface in the limit of ultra - relativistic intensities .",
    "comparing the measured divergences with those that would be obtained by diffraction from a flat pm for the same source size [ black dashed lines in fig.[exp1](c - d ) ] shows that the harmonic divergence is close to this limit when @xmath17 is small , but is then very significantly increased by the pm curvature , here by a factor of up to 3 , for the typical gradients that optimize the rom conversion efficiency ( @xmath92 to @xmath93 ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis provides a clear indication of the focusing of the harmonics in front of the pm , due to its surface curvature .",
    "the measurements of fig.[exp1](d ) show that this focusing increases with the gradient scale length @xmath17 , as expected from the model , since a longer gradient leads to a softer restoring force from the ion background , and hence to a larger surface denting @xmath56 .",
    "the laser pulse duration used in this experiment is so short that ion motion has little influence on the pm curvature , and hence on the harmonic divergence ( white dot on fig.[sim2 ] ) . according to fig.[sim1](d ) , it however significantly changes the temporal dynamics of the surface in the falling edge of the pulse .",
    "we now demonstrate that this can lead to observable effects in the experiment , by considering the spectral properties of the harmonics .      after a fast initial transient where the denting @xmath56 strongly varies ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the field envelop @xmath24 only leads to a weak residual drift of pm surface during the pulse ( black dots in fig.[sim1](d ) ) , with typical velocities of the order of @xmath94 according to our model .",
    "this motion appears as a slow drift on the femtosecond time scale , that combines with the fast relativistic oscillation of the plasma surface at the laser frequency responsible for hhg ( see fig.[sim1](c ) ) .",
    "this results in a doppler shift on the reflected light , which scales linearly with harmonic order @xmath95 , and thus gets measurable for large enough values of @xmath95 .",
    "since the ion dynamics affects the temporal evolution of the pm surface , it can potentially influence this doppler effect .",
    "this is confirmed by a comparison of pic simulations performed with fixed ( fig.[sim4](a ) ) and moving ions ( fig.[sim4](b ) ) . in the case of fixed ions ,",
    "the plasma surface moves inward in the rising part of the pulse , leading to a doppler redshift , and then moves outward in the falling part , leading to a doppler blueshift .",
    "if strong enough , this effect leads to harmonics with a double peak structure @xcite , clearly observed in fig.[sim4](a ) .",
    "in contrast , when ion motion is allowed in the simulation , the irreversible erosion of the ion density gradient prevents the electron boundary from moving back to its initial position when the laser intensity decreases .",
    "this naturally suppresses the doppler blueshift , and only a doppler redshift is observed , in the interaction conditions considered here .",
    "turning back to the experiment , fig.[exp2](a ) shows a zoom on the spatio - spectral distribution of the @xmath96 harmonic , measured in a typical shot .",
    "it is very similar to the pic results of fig.[sim4](b ) , and only a red shift is observed : according to the previous discussion , this is a signature of ion motion .",
    "fig.[exp2](b ) shows that the doppler shift at the center of the beam increases with the density gradient scale length @xmath17 , which is consistent with the stronger curvature of the pm for larger @xmath17 .",
    "this dependence is quantitatively reproduced by our model , when both ion and electron dynamics are taken into account using the same parameters as in fig.[exp1 ] .",
    "thus , although ion dynamics does not affect the spatial properties of harmonics in our experimental conditions , it has a clear signature in the spectral domain , which validates the ionic part of our model .",
    "we have presented a simple analytical model for the spatial properties of light beams reflected by relativistic plasma mirrors , in excellent agreement with both pic simulations and experimental results .",
    "it provides insight into the respective roles of ion and electron dynamics , and into the spatial and spectral properties of harmonics generated in the reflected beam .",
    "combined with this model , these harmonics now constitute a direct and powerful diagnostic of the femtosecond motion of the pm surface , with spatial resolution within the laser focal spot ( fig.[sim4](c ) ) .",
    "measurements schemes such as photonic streaking @xcite will potentially also provide temporal resolution within the laser pulse envelop",
    ".    this model will be instrumental in designing future applications of plasma mirrors , in particular for attosecond science .",
    "it can for instance be used to determine what laser pulse duration is required to generate isolated rom attosecond pulses using the lighthouse effect @xcite . in this perspective , as well as in most applications where the reflected beam is manipulated or used in the far - field , being able to control and minimize the attosecond beam divergence is essential  @xcite , which requires mitigating the effect of the laser - induced pm curvature .",
    "figure [ exp3 ] provides the first experimental demonstration in the relativistic regime of a very simple scheme for such a control  @xcite : by using a driving laser - beam with a slightly diverging wavefront on target , the effect of the pm curvature on the attosecond beam can be compensated , leading to a divergence close to the one that would be obtained for a flat mirror , reduced by a factor of more than 2 compared to the one obtained at best focus .    in other applications",
    ", pm will prove useful to focus the reflected beam , and boost the peak intensity of the fundamental laser frequency  @xcite or its harmonics  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved using either curved substrates , or the natural light - induced pm curvature described in this work , which typically leads to magnification factors @xmath97 for @xmath98 in the interaction regime considered here . in either case , the understanding of the laser - induced pm surface dynamics provided by this work will be essential .    the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council ( erc grant agreement no .",
