    "butcher & oemler s ( 1978,1984 ) discovery that fraction of blue galaxies in clusters increases with redshift first highlighted the significance and strength of the evolution of the cluster galaxy population over the past 4 - 5 gyr .",
    "the butcher - oemler effect has since been confirmed by many authors ( rakos , schombert 1995 ; couch et al . 1994,1998 ; margoniner , de carvalho 2000 ; margoniner et al . 2001 ; ellingson et al . 2001 ;",

    "blue and star - forming galaxies are clearly more common in intermediate redshift clusters than in their local counterparts .",
    "furthermore , the population fraction of s0 galaxies is lower in high redshift clusters ( dressler et al . 1997 ; van dokkum et al . 1998 ; fasano et al . 2000 ; jones , smail , & couch 2000 ; fabricant et al . 2000 ; also see andreon et al .",
    "1998 ; postman et al . 2004 ) and van dokkum et al . (",
    "1998 ) have identified a significantly larger fraction of merging / interacting galaxies in the cluster ms1054 - 0321 at @xmath0 .",
    "these observations suggest that environmental processes are at least partly responsible for altering the morphology and star formation rates ( sfr ) of cluster galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "there is likely more than one physical mechanism involved given the large dynamic range in density over which the morphology - density relation extends ( postman et al .",
    "1984 ; goto et al .",
    "however , it has been difficult to specify which specific physical processes are the dominant ones given a limited amount data at key epochs over the past half a hubble time .    the cluster galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is a fundamental constraint on the mass assembly history of galaxy clusters as it is related to the cluster galaxy mass function through the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "precise and accurate measurements of cluster lfs as a functions of local galaxy density , clustocentric radius , galaxy structure and color have the potential to provide insight into the role of environmental processes in determining the properties of the present - day galaxy populations .",

    "a slight change in the criterion of the separation between extended and point sources ( _ e.g. , _ using a class_star value of 0.8 instead of 0.5 as the threshold ) does not affect our results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : incompleteness ] , we show the fraction of galaxies that have a spectroscopic redshift among all galaxies in the imaging data as a function of apparent @xmath44 magnitude . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : incompleteness ] , the completeness is almost independent of magnitude in the range of @xmath56 , indicating that the spectroscopic survey is not strongly biased and has a high degree of completeness .",
    "regardless , when we measure a lf in the following sections , we correct for the incompleteness by weighting the observed counts by the inverse of the completeness .    in the following analyses ,",
    "we divide our cluster galaxy sample using various criteria in morphology , environment , and color . when measuring lfs of these subsamples , the incompleteness correction is re - computed using each subsample of galaxies , and then applied to the lfs of each subsample accordingly . as an example",

    "it can be seen that the completeness is not strongly dependent on @xmath58 color .",
    "when we construct a lf in different passbands ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , we correct the counts using the incompleteness as a function of magnitude in that passband .      because different physical mechanism that act upon galaxies in dense environments have efficiencies that vary as a function of density or position , we quantify the lf as a function of these variables in a hope of understanding the underlying processes ( see a review in treu et al .",

    "[ fig : radec ] ) , we calculate the density by dividing the area within the data region . this parameterization is similar to the one used in previous work ( e.g. , goto et al .",

    "although our local galaxy density is a two - dimensional surface density , the contamination from both foreground and background galaxies is zero because we are using spectroscopic information . however , because we do not have spectroscopic redshifts for all the members , our measured density is an underestimate .",
    "we use this density only for internal comparisons .",
    "we have chosen the 5th nearest to measure local galaxy density , but we also have confirmed that using up to the 10th nearest neighbor does not change the main results described below .      to assess dependencies of the lf on position within the cluster , we measure the projected distance to the cluster center , @xmath61 , for all spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies .",
    "we use the position of the brightest cluster galaxy ( j2000 ra : 10h 56 m 59.99s , dec : -03d 37 m 36.1s ) as the center of the cluster . using the centroid of the x - ray surface brightness distribution ( neumann & arnaud 2000 ) does not significantly change the results . the virial radius of the cluster is known to be @xmath621 mpc ( tran et al . 1999 ) . in fig.[fig : distance_density ] , we compare the clustocentric distance with the local galaxy density . the solid lines connect medians .",
    "the error bars are based on the rms in each bin . as expected",

    "the values of the best fit lf parameters do not strongly depend on our choice of the bin size in the range @xmath67 .",
    "the incompleteness correction is determined empirically by dividing the number of objects with measured redshifts in a given apparent magnitude bin by the total number of galaxies in that same bin .",
    "the total number of galaxies in a bin is taken from our sextractor catalog .",
    "the corrected number counts as a function of apparent magnitude are then converted to the corresponding absolute magnitude using a distance modulus of @xmath68 .",

    "the galaxy colors start to change significantly at around @xmath630.9 mpc or @xmath8510 - 40 mpc@xmath9 , which is the same environment where the gdr starts to change .",
    "postman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that the morphological composition of galaxies starts to change at a similar environment at @xmath51 as well .",
    "a substantial volume of evidence thus suggests there is at least one physical mechanism that begins to become important at around @xmath630.9 mpc or @xmath8510 - 40 mpc@xmath9 and plays a role in altering the luminosity , sfr , and morphology of cluster galaxies .",
    "various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain this cluster galaxy transformation .",
    "these mechanisms include ram - pressure stripping of cold gas by the intra - cluster medium ( gunn & gott 1972 ; farouki & shapiro 1980 ; kent 1981 ; fujita & nagashima 1999 ; abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ; fujita & goto 2004 ) ; galaxy harassment via high speed impulsive encounters ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ; fujita 1998 ) ; cluster tidal forces ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ; valluri 1993 ; fujita 1998 ; gnedin 2003a , b ) which distort galaxies as they come close to the centre ; interaction / merging of galaxies ( icke 1985 ; lavery & henry 1988 ; mamon 1992 ; makino & hut 1997 ; bekki 1998 ; finoguenov et al .",
    "2003 ) ; evaporation of the cold gas in disc galaxies via heat conduction from the surrounding hot icm ( cowie & songaila 1977 ; fujita 2004 ) ; and a gradual decline in the sfr of a galaxy due to the stripping of hot halo gas ( strangulation or suffocation ; larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ; bekki et al .",
    "2002 ; kodama et al .",
    "2001b ; finoguenov et al .",
    "2003 ) .    among these processes , ram - pressure stripping and the evaporation of the cold gas",
    "may be disfavored by our results . since",
    "0.9 mpc is almost the virial radius , the icm density will be too low for these mechanisms to work with any substantial efficiency ( kodama et al . 2001b ; treu et al .",
    "2003 ; also see mamon et al .",
    "2004 ; moore et al .",
    "galaxy - galaxy merging would be consistent with both of the above results .",
    "however , for galaxy - galaxy merging to be an efficient mechanism the relative velocity of the merging galaxies must be comparable with their internal velocity dispersion ( makino & hut 1997 ) . thus , such mergers would have to take place in infalling , low velocity dispersion groups or at an epoch when the cluster mass was still comparable with that on group mass scales .",
    "all we can conclude for now is that merging remains a viable explanation , but not necessarily the only explanation , for the observed trends seen in ms1054 - 0321 as a function of density and position .",
    "in an effort to gain further insight into the physical processes associated with cluster galaxy formation and evolution , we have explored correlations between the global parameters of the galaxy luminosity function and the properties of galaxies in the cluster ms1054 - 0321 at @xmath0 .",
    "our study is based on 143 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members imaged with the acs in the @xmath133 and @xmath45 filters . due to the wide field of view and high resolution imaging capability of the acs",
    ", we were able to study cluster lfs as a function of environment , color , and morphology .",
    "our key findings are summarized below .    1 .",
    "the faint - end slope of the lfs is steeper in the bluest band ( fig.[fig : lf_3mag ] ) .",
    "the lf of galaxies in the inner part of the cluster ( @xmath80 mpc ) has a flatter faint - end slope than that in the outer regions ( @xmath81 mpc ; fig.[fig : lf_distance ] ) .",
    "the corresponding trend can be seen when the lf is measured as a function of the local galaxy density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_density ] ) .",
    "the fraction of early - type galaxies is largest at the bright end of the lf and gradually decreases toward fainter magnitudes ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lf_morph ] and  [ fig : morph_ratio ] ) .",
    "4 .   the trends seen in ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) are generally in agreement with observations of local galaxy clusters showing that the cluster core regions are dominated by bright early - type galaxies .",
    "hence , a lf similar to what is seen at low redshift is well established in ms1054 - 0321 , suggesting that , on average , the galaxies in this massive cluster began their formation at redshifts considerably greater than unity .",
    "when the lf is partitioned by @xmath58 color , we find a marginally significant ( @xmath134 ) deficit of faint red galaxies ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the deficit is inferred as well when we analyze the lf as a function of morphology  a possible lack of early - type galaxies in the faintest bin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_morph ] ) .",
    "if real , these trends may suggest that faint , red , early - type galaxies have not been yet created in ms1054 - 0321 .",
    "a deficit of such galaxies has not been seen in low-@xmath119 clusters .",
    "the giant - to - dwarf ratio exhibits a strong radial dependence beginning at around the virial radius or a strong density dependence when the density increases above @xmath13530 mpc@xmath9 .",
    "the ratio is higher in the inner parts ( or higher density regions ) of the cluster ( figs .",
    "[ fig : gdr_radius ] and  [ fig : gdr_density ] ) .",
    "this environment roughly corresponds to the same location where galaxy color and the morphology start to vary significantly with position and density ( figs .",
