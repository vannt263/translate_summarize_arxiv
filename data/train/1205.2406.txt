    "the milky way ( mw ) is widely recognized as a unique laboratory to test physical mechanisms of galaxy formation in the universe as well as an underlying cosmology through observation of resolved stellar populations . in the context of galaxy formation theories based on the currently standard @xmath5cdm model , the mw is formed through accretions of smaller stellar systems like dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations have been performed to examine observable consequences of this process , implementing prescriptions of both assembly of dark matter halos and star formation within these halos .",
    "these studies generally suggest that the accreted galaxies imprint distinct substructures in both phase- and chemical abundance - space for many gyrs @xcite , demonstrating that the kinematics and chemical abundances are an important tracer of the merging history of the galaxy .",
    "kinematics and chemical composition of nearby stars have provided one of the major constraints on the formation of the galaxy ever since the landmark study of @xcite . currently available observational data on the phase - space structure of the galactic stars show signatures of such accretion events of dsphs , as evidenced by spatial distribution and stellar populations of halo globular clusters @xcite , streams / overdensities in spatial distribution of stars @xcite , kinematic substructures @xcite , and a metallicity distribution of globular clusters @xcite .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic studies based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) further advanced our view of the galaxy .",
    "the three - dimensional map out to the galactocentric distance of @xmath6 kpc provided by the sdss shows that the substructures and stellar streams are ubiquitous , suggesting that the galactic halo has formed , at least in part , through satellite accretions @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the stellar halo is divisible into two components , by studying spatial distributions , kinematics and metallicity of stars out to a several kpc from the sun based on the sdss data .",
    "although the net - rotational velocity may be subject to some uncertainty in the currently available data ( see discussions in @xcite ) , at least growing number of observations suggest that the outer region of the galactic halo contains a certain fraction of stars with extreme motions , that are difficult to account for with a single component halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these recent results highlight complex nature of the process taken place to form the galactic halo .",
    "to construct a concrete scenario for the mw formation , an important next step is examining whether the old galactic components , namely , the thick disk and the stellar halo , are chemically divisible into subcomponents and , if so , getting insights about masses , luminosities , gaseous contents or time of accretions of progenitors of each subcomponent .",
    "furthermore , it was proposed that not only stars accreted from dwarf galaxies , but also those formed `` in situ '' have played an important role in forming the current structure of the galactic halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to make constraints on a relative contribution of these processes , detailed elemental abundances of stars belonging to each component provide useful signatures in addition to their phase - space structures and overall metallicities .",
    "detailed chemical abundance patterns of individual stars have been used as a fossil record of the star forming gas cloud at the stellar birthplace , which are likely conserved longer than the phase - space structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". in particular , @xmath7-element - to - iron abundance ratios ( [ @xmath7/fe ] ) , where @xmath7 usually stands for elements including o , mg , si , ca and ti , are commonly used to characterize nucleosynthesis and chemical enrichment history of a stellar population @xcite .",
    "this is based on the theory that @xmath7-elements are mainly synthesized in massive stars and ejected in type ii supernovae ( sne ) within a short timescale , while fe is ejected both in type ii and type ia sne , for an extended period of time ( time scale of type ia sne is estimated to distribute from 0.1 gyr to more than 10 gyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "chemical enrichment of successive sne ii / ia events finally form a characteristic trend in [ @xmath7/fe ] with [ fe / h ] .",
    "the trend can depend on various environment of star formation such as an efficiency that gas is converted to stars , ability that the system can retain their enriched metals or initial mass function ( imf ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the [ @xmath7/fe]-[fe / h ] trend is , therefore , considered as a useful diagnostic to constrain chemical evolution of the structural components of the mw , including the thin disk @xcite , bulge @xcite , thick disk @xcite , and stellar halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarities and differences between these components were also investigated @xcite .",
    "studies on [ @xmath7/fe]-[fe / h ] trends further extended to the mw dwarf galaxies like relatively bright classical dwarfs @xcite and the recently discovered ultra - faint dwarfs @xcite . in particular ,",
    "based on a homogeneous analysis of @xmath7-element abundances based on medium resolution spectra , @xcite examined the trend in [ @xmath7/fe ] with [ fe / h ] of the individual dwarf mw satellites to characterize their star formation history and its relation to the global properties like stellar / dynamical mass , luminosity of these galaxies .",
    "such trend , therefore , is an important tracer of chemical enrichment in possible progenitors of the old components of our galaxy , namely , the thick disk and stellar halo .",
    "previous studies on chemical abundances of nearby stars taking into account information on kinematics provide important insights into the hierarchical formation of the mw halo @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite ( hereafter ns10 ) found the two distinct populations in the halo in terms of [ @xmath7/fe ] , namely `` low-@xmath7 '' and high-@xmath7 stars , by performing a precise differential abundance analysis for the sample stars having similar metallicities and atmospheric parameters .",
    "ns10 also found that the `` low-@xmath7 '' stars tend to have higher orbital energies .",
    "this correspondence between abundances and kinematics implies that the low-@xmath7 stars may represent accreted populations . in order to get more insights into the relation of these chemical inhomogeneity with formation history of each structural component of the mw , a homogeneous sample that includes stars having characteristic kinematics of the thick disk , inner , and outer halo components",
    "is necessary .",
    "furthermore , the [ @xmath7/fe ] ratios for these three components in a wide metallicity range allow us to examine possible trend of the [ @xmath7/fe ] with [ fe / h ] , which has a significant implication to the star formation history in progenitors of each galactic component .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , we have presented an abundance analysis of stars whose orbits reach a distance larger than 5 kpc above and below the galactic plane ( @xmath8 kpc ) and compared their abundances with those of stars having smaller @xmath9 from literature .",
    "the comparison in the abundances was not straightforward because of the possible presence of the offset in the results between different studies . in this paper , we instead adopt the same methods as much as possible for all the sample here to avoid any related systematics .",
    "the sample used in this study is selected based on their kinematics so that the sample stars span a large range in kinematic parameters .",
    "in particular , the present sample includes stars having characteristic kinematics of the thick disk , inner , and outer halo stars classified based on the recent estimates of mean of three velocity components and their dispersions from @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : sample ] describes the selection of our sample and their kinematic properties .",
    "then , section [ sec : observation ] describes observation and reduction for the new sample .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] , provides detailed procedure of the estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances .",
    "section [ sec : results ] and [ sec : discussion ] show our main results on [ @xmath7/fe ] and discuss implications on progenitors of the mw thick disk and the stellar halo .",
    "the sample stars for our high - resolution spectroscopy were selected from the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these catalogs include data on photometry , radial velocity , proper motions and metallicity estimates .",
    "space motions , galactic orbital parameters and distances for the stars in the catalogs were re - derived as described in section [ sec : orbit ] .    in the present study , the stars having [ fe / h]@xmath1 and @xmath10 mag were selected . in our previous studies",
    "@xcite , we have adopted the kinematic criteria of @xmath9 , greater than 5 kpc , in order to select mainly the stars belonging to the outer stellar halo .",
    "we have supplement this sample with the stars having the orbital parameters characteristics of the thick disk and the inner stellar halo for the observing runs in 2010 . the combined sample , which consists of stars having a wide range of metallicity and orbital parameters , is analyzed in a homogeneous manner .",
    "therefore , this sample is suitable to examine the characteristic abundance patterns of the thick disk , inner , and outer stellar halos as a function of metallicity and orbital parameters with minimal systematic errors .",
    "observations of the additional targets in 2010 are described in section [ sec : observation ] .",
    "velocity components in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , apo / peri - galactic distances ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and maximum distances above / below the galactic plane ( @xmath9 ) were calculated as in @xcite . in this calculation ,",

    "we also employ fractional contribution of each component , @xmath33 in equation ( [ eq : membership ] ) , which varies according to a given @xmath9 range @xcite .",
    "the adopted values for these parameters from @xcite are summarized in table [ tab : kinparams ] .",
    "note that these parameters may be updated by the reanalysis of @xcite , although the basic characteristics for each component have remained similar and it does not significantly affect the membership assignment in the present work .",
    "additionally , we impose that @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the stars having @xmath36 kpc , so that the star having an orbit with a low @xmath9 but a large @xmath14 is classified as an outer halo candidate . in equations ( [ eq : membership ] ) , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are normalized so that they sum up to unity .    of the observed sample stars , objects showing broad spectral lines , probably due to rapid rotation , or those turn out to be metal - rich stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath37 ) as a result of our abundance analysis are excluded from the following analysis . as a result , 97 stars remain .",

    "this choice has been made to avoid getting unusually low @xmath64 and surface gravity ( @xmath65 ) when these are constrained simultaneously using the fe excitation energies and ionization balance , likely caused by non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects on fe abundances @xcite .",

    "@xcite examined the abundance - ep trends in a lte and nlte line abundance calculations for their sample of metal - poor stars and reported that the negative trends found by lte analysis are reduced by the nlte calculation .",

    "for these three sample stars , the differences in the atmospheric structures between the atlas and the marcs model , as can be seen in figure [ fig : opma ] , result in difference in the abundance ratios comparable or much smaller than systematic errors from other sources ( e.g. , @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath71 ) .",
    "as expected , the plane - parallel geometry would not be a very good approximation for giant stars as seen in the deviation in [ /h ] by @xmath114 dex when the marcs spherical model is adopted instead of the atlas plane - parallel model for hd 215601 .",
    "such geometry effect is expected to be relatively small for lines with ew@xmath115 m as mainly used in the present work in the examination by @xcite for a wide range of @xmath64 and @xmath65 with solar - metallicity .",
    "the effect is much smaller in atmospheres with lower metallicity as examined above .",
    "furthermore , the effect tends to cancel out in part when the ratio of the two abundances of either neutral or ionized species is taken .",
    "therefore , although full ranges in atmospheric parameters are not examined here , we adopt the atlas / newodf model atmosphere , assuming that the geometry effect remains to be small in the [ x / fe ] ratios for our sample stars in order to keep homogeneity in the analysis method .",

    "for other orbital parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath9 , @xmath14 ) , significant correlation with [ x / fe ] is not clearly seen .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we first compare the results for the [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] ratios with those obtained for stars belonging to the mw dwarf satellite galaxies . finally , we discuss the implications of the present result for the formation of the mw thick disk and stellar halo .",
    "@xcite review recent data on the abundances for the mw dwarf satellites including fornax , sculptor , sagittarius and carina dsphs . in [ fe / h]@xmath126 ,",
    "the thick disk , inner , and outer halo stars in the present sample show higher [ mg / fe ] than those seen in the stars in the dsphs .",
    "for example , the sculptor dsph shows a near solar average value of the [ mg / fe ] ratio at [ fe / h]@xmath170 @xcite , while the inner and the outer halo stars at this metallicity show the average [ mg / fe ] of @xmath171 ( table [ tab : mean_dev ] ) .",
    "the difference becomes more substantial at higher metallicity , where the [ mg / fe ] decreases with metallicity in sculptor , reaching the sub - solar mean [ mg / fe ] ratio at [ fe / h]@xmath137 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : alpha_kin ] , the sample stars having either extreme retrograde orbits , high @xmath9 or @xmath14 , which are the most likely candidates of the accreted stars , do not show the [ x / fe ] ratios significantly lower than the solar values .",
    "this difference in abundance ratios between the field halo and dsph stars implies that the halo progenitors had different chemical enrichment history from surviving dsphs in terms of star formation rate , galactic wind efficiency or duration and frequency of major star formation episodes that drive chemical enrichment of these systems . in the case of sculptor ,",
    "@xcite show that the [ @xmath7/fe]- [ fe / h ] relation for their medium resolution spectroscopic sample is well reproduced by a model with a low star formation rate , low initial gas mass and the @xmath172 gyr duration of star formation which may have started more than 10 gyr ago .",
    "this scenario suggests that the chemical enrichment of the system proceeds slowly so that the overall metallicity of the system remained low when type ia sne start to enrich the system with fe @xcite .",
    "the inner and outer halo stars show modest decreasing trends in these abundance ratios likely starting at [ fe / h]@xmath173 .",
    "the trends , however , are much shallower than those seen in sculptor .",
    "this result may suggest that the possible progenitors of the inner and outer halo stars have stopped forming stars before the enrichment from type ia sne became significant .    in [ fe / h]@xmath120 , the number of stars studied for individual abundances is smaller , probably because of the relative scarcity of very metal - poor stars in the well - known classical dsphs .",
    "some of the extremely metal - poor stars in the sextans dsphs show near - solar [ mg / fe ] ratios @xcite , that are lower than the inner and the outer halo stars in the present sample . on the other hand , recently discovered ultra - faint dsphs generally show super - solar values of the [ mg / fe ] similar to the inner / outer halo stars @xcite .",
    "given that these observed dsphs show a wide range of [ mg / fe ] ratios from near - solar to @xmath174 , the scatter in the [ mg / fe ] in both the inner and outer halo stars are relatively small ( @xmath175 dex ) .",
    "a larger sample in this low metallicity range is desirable to characterize the abundance ratios and their scatter in the mw halo in comparison with the dsphs .",
    "different behavior of [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] ratios from those of [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] were previously noted for the stars in the mw dwarf satellite galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite show that the trend of the lower [ ca / fe ] and [ /fe ] than [ mg / fe ] or [ si / fe ] for red giant stars is seen in fornax dsph .",
    "they suggest that this discrepancy come from either different nucleosynthetic origins of ca and ti from those of mg and si or significant dependence of type ia sne ca and ti yields on metallicity .",
    "the latter possibility is unlikely because if the type ia sne have contributed significantly to the chemical evolution of the thick disk , the [ mg / fe ] ratios would decrease as the [ fe / h ] increases , which is inconsistent with the observed high [ mg / fe ] ratios for the thick disk stars in the present sample .",
    "if the former is mainly responsible for the low [ ca / fe ] and [ /fe ] ratios , the thick disk stars would be formed in the progenitors that have been enriched more with mg and si from hydrostatic c and o burning than with ca and ti from explosive nucleosynthesis in sne .      the constantly high [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ratios of the thick disk stars , unlike the observed dsphs , suggest that these are predominantly enriched with type ii sne @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the initial star formation in the progenitor of the thick disk stars was high enough to enrich the system to [ fe / h]@xmath176 and short enough to complete before type ia sne produce significant fe .",
    "the low [ ca / mg ] ratios observed for the thick disk stars are in qualitative agreement with those expected from the type ii sne yields integrated over progenitor stellar masses with salpeter imf in @xcite , supporting enrichment in the thick disk progenitors has occurred predominantly via type ii sne .",
    "thick disk stars in the solar neighborhood are also known to be old ( age @xmath177 gyr ) suggesting that the star formation took place at the early stage of the mw formation @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms are proposed for the origin of the halo stars , in the context of the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario .",
    "first , the halo stars could be formed through dissipative collapse of gaseous material on to the central region of the galaxy , often referred to as `` in situ '' stars @xcite .",
    "this could be achieved either via rapid collapse of primordial gas on to the galactic dark matter halo or through early major mergers of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "in such a system , high star formation rate is triggered by shocks in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and , as a result , metal enrichment proceeds primarily through type ii sne with a short time - scale comparable to the age of massive stars ( @xmath178 yr ) .",
    "thus , this process would yield stars with high [ @xmath7/fe ] . in the present study , such high-[@xmath7/fe ] stars",
    "are found both in the thick disk and the inner halo subsamples , as seen in the [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe]-[fe / h ] plots in the left panel of figure [ fig : mg_si_ca ] .",
    "this result suggests that a sizable fraction of the inner halo stars were formed out of gas enriched rapidly via type ii sne before type ia sne became a significant contributor to metals in the ism , similar to the thick disk stars .",
    "the second possibility is that the halo stars were originally formed within isolated dwarf galaxies that are later accreted to the galaxy .",
    "the accreted dwarf galaxies would be tidally disrupted as they orbit around the galaxy .",
    "the debris stars then populated the halo while kept their orbital velocity similar to their disrupted host galaxies .",
    "in this case , the stellar mass of the halo grows more slowly than the former case .",
    "chemical abundance of the halo stars , then , would reflect metal - enrichment history in their progenitor dwarf galaxy , that would have less efficient star formation history because of their shallower potential well than that of the galaxy , which makes the enriched gas easier to escape .",
    "since many of the surviving mw dwarf satellites show lower [ @xmath7/fe ] that are indicative of their lower star formation rate , it is naively expected that the halo stars would also have lower [ @xmath7/fe ] ratios if the major fraction of the halo stars have been accreted from such a system . in the present study , the lower [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] or [ ca / fe ] in [",
    "fe / h]@xmath126 than the thick disk subsample is found for both the inner and the outer halo subsamples .",
    "the lower [ @xmath7/fe ] for some of the inner and outer halo stars may indicate that the progenitors of these stars have enriched with metals via type ia sne and/or galactic winds are efficient in ejecting metals out of the system , as suggested for the mw dwarf satellites @xcite . then , the decreasing [ mg / fe ] with increasing @xmath152 seen in figure [ fig : alpha_kin ] could be interpreted as fraction of the accreted stars might increase with @xmath152 in the present sample .    even though some halo star in our sample show relatively low [ @xmath7/fe ] , that is not as significant as found in stars in the dwarf galaxies as mentioned in section [ sec : dsph ] .",
    "the difference in the [ @xmath7/fe ] ratios between the mw stellar halo and the dwarf satellites can be explained if the progenitors of the stellar halo have been accreted early on stopping its star formation , while the surviving satellites have chemically enriched for a longer time @xcite .",
    "the implication from the simulation of @xcite further suggests that the lack of large - scale gradients in the [ @xmath7/fe ] ( figure [ fig : alpha_kin ] ) supports the early accretions ( @xmath179 gyr ago ) for the mw halo .",
    "the apparent lack of the [ @xmath7/fe ] correlation with @xmath38 and @xmath180 may support the early accretion scenario .",
    "the quiescent accretion history of the mw halo for the last @xmath181 gyrs is also supported by the recent finding of @xcite that their sample of metal - rich halo stars at [ fe / h]@xmath182 , are older than @xmath181 gyrs , including relatively younger `` low-@xmath7 '' stars .",
    "@xcite suggest another origin of the halo stars ; disk stars can be dynamically heated to become halo stars via minor mergers on the disk plane . in the present sample ,",
    "the stars classified as having the intermediate kinematics between the thick disk and the inner halo stars , shown in the open blue circles in figure [ fig : mg_si_ca ] , show relatively high [ mg / fe ] ratios similar to the thick disk stars .",
    "this result suggests that the stars having moderately disk - like orbit could have been formed in a rapid star formation event like the thick disk stars .",
    "cosmological simulations of @xcite and @xcite suggest that a hybrid scenario for the halo formation is naturally expected in the hierarchical formation of the mw . more specifically",
    ", recent hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite suggest that , at a galactocentric distance grater than 20 kpc , where the halo component dominates over the bulge component , about 20% of stars may have formed in situ , while the other fraction of stars formed within satellite galaxies .    the possible boundary at which transition in the dominant progenitors ( `` in situ ''",
    ", accreted dsph , heated disk ) may occur is not very well constrained in the present study .",
    "if any , the question of whether the transition occurs sharply or mildly would be important in constraining the merging history of our galaxy .",
    "more qualitative conclusion on this issue should only be made after the sample is significantly expanded .",
    "current sample stars are all located in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath183 kpc ) , in which the fraction of the halo stars is very low .",
    "obviously , larger volumes in the halo should be investigated in order to construct a sample representative of the halo population . since",
    "high resolution spectroscopy is not efficient for a larger sample including distant objects beyond the solar neighborhood , lower resolution spectroscopy combined with a sufficient analysis scheme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be extremely useful to explore properties of the more distant halo .",
    "recently discovered substructures in the stellar halo would be possible candidates of recent accretion events , whose [ @xmath7/fe ] would give information on their progenitors .",
    "@xmath7-element alone may not be enough to constrain the chemical evolution of stellar system , since enrichment mechanisms other than type ii / ia sne are also thought to have played an important role .",
    "for example , the importance of neutron - capture elements that are synthesized via slow - neutron capture in the asymptotic giant branch stars has been emphasized in chemical evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the observation of the dwarf satellites showing significant ba enhancement .",
    "analysis of such neutron - capture elements as well as iron peak elements will be presented in the forthcoming paper ( m. n. ishigaki et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have presented the abundances of fe , mg , si , ca and ti for 97 metal - poor stars covering a wide range of metallicity ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 ) and orbital parameters , including those having the extreme outer halo kinematics . the abundances were obtained from the high - resolution spectra taken with subaru / hds using a one - dimensional lte abundance analysis code with kurucz model atmospheres .",
    "our results provide insights about differences and similarities in the [ @xmath7/fe ] ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] and the kinematics among the three presumably old galactic components , the thick disk , inner , and outer stellar halo as summarized below :    * the thick disk stars show high [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ratios than the inner and outer halo stars in their overlapping metallicity range ( [ fe / h]@xmath126 ) .",
    "the high abundance ratios for mg and si , that are predominantly synthesized in massive stars , are in good agreement with previous studies .",
    "this result suggests that the thick disk stars were formed out of gas primarily enriched by type ii sne of massive stars with little contribution of fe from type ia sne . *",
    "the inner halo stars span a wide range in [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ratios compared to the thick disk stars .",
    "the results imply that the inner halo stars have formed in various formation sites , presumably including the collapsed gas in the early galaxy or dwarf galaxies accreted early times . *",
    "the outer halo stars show similar mean [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ratios as the inner halo stars , which is lower than those of the thick disk stars .",
    "the inner and the outer halo stars together show a hint of a decreasing trend in [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] with [ fe / h ] in [ fe / h]@xmath184 .",
    "these results suggest that the contribution from type ia sne may have played some role in the chemical evolution of the outer halo progenitor .",
    "* the three subsamples show largely overlapping distributions in the [ ca / fe ] , [ /fe ] and [ /fe ] versus [ fe / h ] diagrams .",
    "the different nucleosynthesis site for these two elements from that of mg and si may explain this result .",
    "however , because of the large errors in [ /fe ] and [ /fe ] , presumably due to the nlte effects , definitive conclusions from the ti abundances can not be made in the present study . *",
    "significant correlation of the [ x / fe ] ratios with the orbital parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath9 , @xmath14 ) is not observed in the present sample , except for the decreasing [ mg / fe ] trend with the increasing @xmath152 in @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath3 .",
    "this result suggests that dwarf galaxies having low [ x / fe ] ratios have not significantly contributed to build up the present - day stellar halo .",
    "since this conclusion is drawn only from the local sample , the abundance data for a larger volume of the galaxy are desirable to evaluate the large - scale abundance gradient .",
    "more quantitative conclusions on the large - scale distribution of [ @xmath7/fe ] are expected by next - generation multi - object spectroscopic surveys that cover a larger volume of the mw thick disk and stellar halo .",

    "<S> abundances of fe , mg , si , ca and ti have been derived using a one - dimensional lte abundance analysis code with kurucz newodf model atmospheres . by assigning membership of the sample stars to the thick disk , inner or outer halo components based on their orbital parameters , we examine abundance ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] and kinematics for the three subsamples in wide metallicity and orbital parameter ranges .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the metallicity range of @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath3 , the thick disk stars show constantly high mean [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ratios with small scatter . in contrast , the inner , and the outer halo stars show lower mean values of these abundance ratios with larger scatter . the [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] for the inner and the outer halo stars also show weak decreasing trends with [ fe / h ] in the range [ fe / h]@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these results favor the scenarios that the mw thick disk formed through rapid chemical enrichment primarily through type ii supernovae of massive stars , while the stellar halo has formed at least in part via accretion of progenitor stellar systems having been chemically enriched with different timescales . </S>"
