    "the `` three - body '' problem is as old as the study of physics itself .",
    "after sir isaac newton showed ( in his _ principia _ ) that it was possible to infer the orbits of _ two _ , mutually interacting bodies using only the laws of mathematics , mankind has endeavored to derive an analytic description of the motion of _ three _ , mutually interacting particles .",
    "three - body interactions abound in natural processes as diverse as stellar evolution and thin - film growth and occur over a very wide range of energies . for the present discussion",
    ", continuum atomic scattering will be considered for three mutually interacting charged particles interacting via the infinite range coulomb potential .",
    "calculation of local distortion effects herein derived will be carried out over representative energies of between @xmath2 .    in section [ sec : notation ] , the traditional jacobi coordinates are introduced and key historical results are given . while the notation used here is not substantially different , minor errors have been corrected and additional properties and unique results have been added .",
    "a revised description of the so called local momenta , first presented in @xcite is offered in section [ sec : origin ] . while the local momenta derived here",
    "also depend upon the logarithmic gradient of a continuum state , coulomb wave - here referred to as the local distortion - the coordinate dependence is such that variations of the momenta can not be ignored in an _ a priori _ manner .",
    "the development continues in section [ sec : general ] , where a detailed discussion of the mathematical and physical properties of the local momenta is offered .",
    "appendix [ app:1f1 ] shows that the local distortion can be expressed as a damped oscillator function that is analytic over all regions , thus improving the ability to assess the possible contributions of these local effects in both the inner ( reaction - zone ) , and the outer ( asymptotic ) regions of the three - body scattering event .. ] this analysis reveals that while local distortion effects generally `` fall - off '' in the asymptotic regions , they may alter the outcome of a scattering event by rearranging particles in the reaction - zone .",
    "appendix [ app : kc5c ] demonstrates however that one may incorporate local effects while retaining the appropriate asymptotic form for the continuum state , three - body wavefunction . from this a new interpretation of the three - body scattering event",
    "emerges , wherein a two - body continuum pair acquires a local momentum by scattering off of an exact interaction potential .",
    "section [ sec : rearrange ] illustrates that generalized local momentum effects may be used to explain the observed asymmetry in the data collected in the triple - coincidence detection experiment of wiese et .",
    "al . , @xcite .",
    "the experiment considered three large , very nearly equal mass , mutually interacting , charged particles . with the appropriate total center - of - mass energy and reduced mass parameters chosen to reflect those used in the actual experiment , the predicted local effects are shown to be large enough to reproduce the observed asymmetry .",
    "this result is taken as motivation to hypothesize that the generalized local momentum be treated as a possible gauge transformation for three - body interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] this hypothesis is formalized and a semi - classical analysis reveals that while a real - valued , position dependent phase is added to the two - body continuum state wavefunction , the asymptotic form of the relevant two - body hamiltonian remains unchanged .",
    "the traditional jacobi coordinates , here denoted by @xmath3 along with their respective , congugate momenta , @xmath4 where @xmath5 will be used to indicate a particular channel representation .",
    "these coordinates are particularly well suited for the study of the motions of three mutually interacting particles because they locate the conventional reduced masses of the system .",
    "these coordinates are shown in figure [ fig : jacobi ] and the `` alpha - channel '' representation will be used unless otherwise specified .",
    "the reduced masses located by the @xmath6 coordinates are given by    [ eq : masses ] @xmath7    respectively and the other masses are defined cyclically .",
    "in addition , there are two relationships that the jacobi coordinates and their conjugate momenta obey that will be of use in the current development .",
    "these are ,    @xmath8    while ( [ eq : relationa ] ) can be `` seen '' in figure [ fig : jacobi ] , ( [ eq : relationb ] ) is more subtle and is a statement of the `` relative - velocity conservation '' for the three - body system .",
    "these relationships follow from the orthogonality of the jacobi coordinates and are easily verified using the transformation matrices for the coordinates ,    @xmath9    and for the momenta ,    @xmath10    a further consequence of these transformations is that the three - body , coulomb potential may be expressed as follows , all physical constants are retained so that the interested reader may verify explicit numerical results cited later in the text without normalization . ] : @xmath11 where the @xmath12 ( @xmath5 ) are the appropriate charge signs . moreover",
    ", the orthogonality of the jacobi coordinates can be used to show that , the three - body schrdinger equation may be written in a channel - independent way .",
    "i.e. , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 has been used , with supressed coordinate dependence , to indicate the full three - body coulomb potential of the @xmath16-channel . here",
    "@xmath17 is the total center of mass energy of three - body system .    to date",
    ", the most successful and widely used approximate solution to the three - body schrdinger equation is the paradigm `` 3c '' wavefunction proposed by redmond@xcite,@xcite and rigorously derived and tested by brauner _ _ et .",
    "the solution is valid in the asymptotic region where all particles are far apart .",
    "traditionally one denotes this region with , @xmath18 , and the solution is given by , @xmath19 where for instance , @xmath20 is the atomic sommerfeld parameter .",
    "the hyper - parabolic coordinate , @xmath21 has been introduced for notational simplicity only , and with the above definition , the wavefunction ( [ eq : redmond ] ) satisfies all incoming boundary conditions in the region @xmath18 .",
    "the overwhelming opinion in the literature is that all valid three - body wavefunctions must match smoothly with this solution in the region @xmath18 .",
    "the logarithmic phase factors in the redmond solution are present _ physically _ because of the infinite nature of the coulomb potential , and arise _ mathematically _ as the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "i.e.,@xcite    @xmath22e^{-\\frac{\\eta_{k_\\nu}\\pi}{2}}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(i\\eta_{k_\\nu})_n}{(1)_n}\\frac{(-i\\zeta_{k_\\nu})^n}{n!}\\\\ c_{\\eta_{k_\\nu}}(\\zeta_{k_\\nu})&=&\\lim_{{r_\\nu}\\to\\infty}e^{-i\\eta_{k_\\nu}\\ln\\zeta_{k_\\nu}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these `` c - functions '' provide one of the representations for the _ exact _ solution to the _ two - body _ scattering problem .",
    "that is , if one writes the two - body wavefunction as @xmath23 then substitution of this form into the two - body schrdinger equation shows that @xmath24 c_{\\eta_{k_\\alpha}}(\\zeta_{k_\\alpha})=0.\\ ] ]    while the very intuitive solution ( [ eq : redmond ] ) has been used with great success by researchers to model both atom - ion @xcite,@xcite and photo - ionization processes @xcite , a more robust solution has been sought in recent years@xcite,@xcite .",
    "particularly , a solution is sought that may be extended into the so called `` interior regions , '' where at least two of the three particles remain close to one another .",
    "it is significant to note that all of the successes of the 3c wavefunction have been achieved for _ light - ion - atom _ systems , where the asymptotic form in @xmath18 has been shown to be generally adequate .",
    "what is sought however is a more precise accounting of the intimacies of the three - body interaction for arbitrary masses and in all regions of the scattering space .",
    "because an exact solution to the atomic three - body problem does not exist , the best hope in achieving an improved wavefunction has been to improve the approximation schemes used .",
    "generally , these approximation schemes fall into two categories :    * approximating the kinetic terms of the hamiltonian ( i.e. , the eikinol approximation ) * approximating the potential terms of the hamiltonian    while these techniques would seem to be mutually exclusive , the problem is that the inseparable nature of the three - body coulomb potential makes the choice of the kinematic description impossible .",
    "research has thus continued along a fragile path and to account for approximation and/or distortion effects , two well established interpretations have emerged :    * introduce a _ local momentum _ , which depends upon the radial separation of two of the three particles through the logarithmic gradient of the continuum two - body wavefunction , and attribute the distortion to a velocity - dependent , auxilary potential .",
    ", @xcite * introduce an _ effective charge _ , which depends upon the radial separation of two of the three particles through the logarithmic gradient of the continuum two - body wavefunction , and attribute the distortion to dynamical screening of charges .",
    "cf . , @xcite    the common dependence upon the two - body solution in these two interpretations is clear and in both the dependence is derived in a rigorous , but _ a posteriori _ way , to satisfy the relevant boundary conditions in the asymptotic regions .",
    "the natural question is if this dependence can be achieved in an _ a priori _ way , utilizing only physical and mathematical intuition .    to approach an answer to this question , it is important to know that there does exist an exact solution to the continuum three - body schrdinger equation for the case when two of the particles remain close together(or equivalently if one of the particles is infinitely massive ) .",
    "the solution depends critically upon the form of the three - body coulomb potential in the region @xmath25 , where two of the particles , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are close together , while particle @xmath28 is infinitely far away from both of them .",
    "that is , one may write a description of the region @xmath25 succinctly as follows : @xmath29 clearly the region @xmath25 matches smoothly with the region @xmath18 , and to investigate the behavior of the three - body coulomb potential in this region , one may write @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the @xmath32 are the legendre polynomials of the first kind .    now in the region @xmath33",
    "the only surviving term in the expansion is for @xmath34 hence the potential has the following asymptotic form : @xmath35 the second term in this expansion is often referred to as the `` reduced charge potential , '' and the resulting form of the three - body wavefunction is separable .",
    "e.g. , the three - body schrdinger equation takes the asymptotic form , @xmath36 \\psi_{\\vec{k}_\\alpha,\\vec{q}_\\alpha}^{\\omega_\\alpha } ( \\vec{r}_\\alpha,\\vec{\\rho}_\\alpha)= { \\mathcal{e}}_t \\psi_{\\vec{k}_\\alpha,\\vec{q}_\\alpha}^{\\omega_\\alpha}(\\vec{r}_\\alpha,\\vec{\\rho}_\\alpha).\\ ] ] because the term @xmath37 couples to the kinetic term @xmath38 , the three - body hamiltonian naturally separates and if one assumes that the three - body wavefunction has the standard plane wave form , @xmath39 where the total energy of the three - body system may be written as @xmath40 for continuum scattering , then substitution into the asymptotic three - body schrdinger equation yields the following equation for @xmath41 in the region @xmath25 : @xmath42 \\phi_{\\vec{k}_\\alpha,\\vec{q}_\\alpha } ( \\vec{r}_\\alpha,\\vec{\\rho}_\\alpha)= 0.\\ ] ] therefore the exact solution in the region @xmath25 is given by , @xmath43 here the function @xmath44 is a reduced charge continuum state coulomb wave , which satisfies @xmath45 c_{\\eta_{q_\\alpha}}(\\zeta_{q_\\alpha})=0,\\ ] ] and @xmath46\\frac{m_\\alpha}{\\hbar q_\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    while equation ( [ eq : exact ] ) constitutes a rigorous solution it is not a valid solution because it does not match smoothly with the result asserted by redmond .",
    "( cf . , equation ( [ eq : redmond ] ) above . ) to see this note that the asymptotic form of ( [ eq : exact ] ) in @xmath18 would be given by @xmath47 clearly , the _ two _ logarithmic phases present in this solution can not match smoothly with the _ three _ present in the redmond solution .",
    "hence ( [ eq : exact ] ) does not constitute a valid solution in the asymptotic region @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , note that as a general wavefunction in the region @xmath18 , ( [ eq : exact ] ) may not be a good choice simply because when the two charges @xmath48 and @xmath49 are of equal and opposite charge , as in the paradigm case of electron scattering from hydrogen , the solution in @xmath50 reduces to that of a free particle .",
    "i.e. , @xmath51    these reasons make it clear that in order to extend the 3c wavefunction into the the asymptotic region , @xmath25 ( or into the interior regions for that matter ) a different approach is warranted .",
    "the current approach , refered to here as `` kinematic coupling , '' involves the introduction of an _ exact _ interaction potential given by : @xmath52 hence the three - body schrdinger equation takes the _ exact _ form : @xmath53 \\psi_{\\vec{k}_\\alpha,\\vec{q}_\\alpha } ( \\vec{r}_\\alpha,\\vec{\\rho}_\\alpha)= { \\mathcal{e}}_t \\psi_{\\vec{k}_\\alpha,\\vec{q}_\\alpha } ( \\vec{r}_\\alpha,\\vec{\\rho}_\\alpha).\\ ] ]    to remain completely general , one then asserts that the total center of mass energy may be written in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the energies associated with the continuum state , two - body clusters , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , and the term @xmath59 accounts for the remaining energy of the three - body interaction .",
    "though the definition ( [ eq : myenergy ] ) is nonstandard , it reflects the fact that because the three - body potential must remain inseparable in a completely general solution , so too must the total energy .    due to the fact that the inseparable portion of the three - body coulomb potential is now contained within the interaction potential , one can assume that the three - body wavefunction takes the form , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an _ unknown _ function , and @xmath62 and @xmath44 are the _ known _ coulomb waves defined in equations ( [ eq : cka ] ) and ( [ eq : cqa ] ) respectively .",
    "that is , the ansatz ( [ eq : mypsi ] ) incorporates the exact solution in the region @xmath25 ( cf . , equation ( [ eq : exact ] ) ) explicitly .",
    "substitution of the form ( [ eq : mypsi ] ) into the three - body schrdinger equation ( [ eq : myschrodinger ] ) yields the following result : @xmath63 where the exponential terms have been cancelled from both sides of the equation and the following vector identities have been employed : @xmath64 and @xmath65    using equations ( [ eq : cka ] ) and ( [ eq : cqa ] ) in conjunction with the definition ( [ eq : myenergy ] ) , one finds that the first two lines in this unwieldy expression are identically zero . then after dividing by the product @xmath66 , the following equation for the unknown function , @xmath61 is derived : @xmath67 \\chi_{\\vec{k}_{\\alpha},\\vec{q}_{\\alpha}}(\\vec{r}_{\\alpha},\\vec{\\rho}_{\\alpha})= { \\mathcal{e}}_i\\chi_{\\vec{k}_{\\alpha},\\vec{q}_{\\alpha}}(\\vec{r}_{\\alpha},\\vec{\\rho}_{\\alpha}),\\ ] ] is found , where    [ eq : momenta ] @xmath68    are the proposed position - dependent local momenta for this kinematic coupling model .",
    "the principle difference in this development is that the local momenta arise purely from the physical structure of the inseparable three - body schrdinger equation , and that their mathematical form implies the existence of position dependent momenta .",
    "furthermore , in the current development , the local momenta are predicted in a symmetric fashion so that both `` legs '' of the three - body interaction experience distortions which depend upon the congugate coordinates .",
    "that is , @xmath69 is congugate to @xmath70 and @xmath71 is congugate to @xmath72 .",
    "this means that the distortion that two of the particles experience does not depend explicitly upon the distance to the third particle as in @xcite , but is rather wholly attributable to a genuine three - body effect wherein a very intuitive description of the three - body scattering event arises :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the two reduced mass clusters @xmath57 and @xmath58 , initially described by the two - body waves , @xmath62 and @xmath44 respectively , scatter off of the interaction potential @xmath73 and acquire a local momenta . _",

    "e.g. , one may write : ( @xmath88 ) @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the relevant _ product charge _ and",
    "_ reduced mass _ of the pair described by @xmath84 , and @xmath92 } { ( 1+\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{r})}.\\ ] ]    the form ( [ eq : distortion ] ) shows that the local momentum is essentially a @xmath93 damped - oscillator function , and that it is analytic everywhere except possibly at @xmath94 equal to zero .",
    "interestingly , it can also be seen that the local momentum has equal radiation ( in the @xmath95 direction ) and induction ( in the @xmath96 direction ) components .",
    "this is indicative of the possibility of a tensor force in a classical treatment or of a nonconserved current density in a quantum treatment of the three - body interaction .",
    "perhaps more importantly , one sees that the local distortion depends upon not only the radial separation of the constituent particles , but also upon both the relative energy and reduced mass of the system .    in figure",
    "[ fig : variousenergies ] the _ real _ part of the distortion experienced by a electron - proton continuum pair has been plotted with various relative energies and an arbitrary scattering angle of @xmath97 .",
    "one sees immediately that the distortion `` falls off '' very quickly with increasing radial separation and even more dramatically with increased relative energy .    to see how the distortion depends upon the reduced mass of the system , observe that in figure [ fig : variousmasses ]",
    ", the _ real _ part of the distortion experienced by an electron - electron pair and a electron - proton pair have been plotted .",
    "notice that the distortion increases accordingly with increased mass , and that the sign of the distortion is different for the cases of attraction and repulsion .",
    "this very interesting point will be discussed in greater detail below , but for now note that in addition to the important physical properties of the local distortion , there are also important mathematical properties .",
    "the most important of these is that because the local distortion is essentially an oscillatory function , the existence of turning and stationary ( i.e. , maxima and minima ) points may yield much insight .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stationarypoints ] one sees that the stationary points occur quite often , so that the local distortion will very often be identically zero ! moreover , these zeroes will be very dense on a macroscopic scale and so may greatly alter the topology of a scattering event .",
    "this can be seen even more dramatically in figure [ fig : visual ] , where three - dimensional and contour plots of the local distortion have been shown .",
    "though there is no analytic form for determining the zeroes of the confluent hypergeometric function , the stationary points of the local distortion may be found by finding the nonzero roots to ( [ eq : mya ] ) .",
    "hence one ends up solving the following transcendental equation : @xmath98}(1-\\cos\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is an integer .",
    "note that if @xmath100 were a constant , ( [ eq : myconic ] ) would be the equation of a conic section with an eccentricity of 1 - parabolas .",
    "hence one sees that the stationary points of the local distortion lie ( very nearly ) along the classically forbidden `` trajectories '' for particles with positive energy ! while this may seem to be no more than coincidence , @xmath100 is in fact very nearly constant between the stationary points ( see fig . [",
    "fig : delta ] ) , and one may infer that these `` zero - distortion - trajectories '' are in fact the dominant contributions in a path - integral approach to the quantum , three - body scattering problem . indeed , from this point of view , one may argue that they must be the dominant contributions for light - ion ",
    "atom processes in the asymptotic regions , where great success has been achieved while ignoring local distortion effects .",
    "what is not clear however is how these local effects will contribute in the so called `` interior regions '' or for heavy - ion  atom processes .",
    "above it was noted that the local distortion had different signs for the attractive and repulsive cases .",
    "the real importance of this observation is that if one imagines a three - body system composed of a tightly bound continuum state pair , with an initial momentum @xmath75 , and a third , mutually interacting particle , then upon break - up the continuum pair will acquire a local momentum @xmath101 . hence the continuum pair will experience a momentum change ( or _ impulse _ ) given by @xmath102 evidently one finds , ( for @xmath88 )    [ eq : impulse ] @xmath103 } { \\hat{p}\\cdot(\\hat{p}+\\hat{r})}\\frac{1}{r}(\\hat{p}+\\hat{r})\\\\ \\vec{i}_{\\mathrm{repulsive}}&=&-|z|\\left(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\hbar}\\right ) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{2 e } } \\frac{\\left[1-\\cos(\\zeta_{p}+2\\delta_{\\eta_{p}}){}\\right ] } { \\hat{p}\\cdot(\\hat{p}+\\hat{r})}\\frac{1}{r}(\\hat{p}+\\hat{r}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equations ( [ eq : impulse ] ) imply that the two particles that are initially attracted to one another , within the continuum pair described by @xmath84 , will experience an impulse that will tend to increase their radial separation upon breakup and conversely , that two particles that are initially repelled from one another will experience an impulse that will tend to decrease their radial separation . in other words , at small values of the radial separation , opposite(same ) sign - charged particles will tend to repel(attract ) one another due to the local distortion effects !    to illustrate this point , the _ real _ part of the distortion for several different continuum pairs have been calculated and the results are shown in figure [ fig : variouspairs ] .",
    "observe that even though all of these distortion terms decrease with increasing radial separation , the magnitude of the distortion in the interior regions depends critically upon the system being studied .",
    "as was shown above in figure [ fig : variousmasses ] , the distortion effects increases dramatically with an increase in the reduced mass .",
    "specifically , note that for the case of a proton  anti - proton ( ( e ) if fig .",
    "[ fig : variouspairs ] ) or proton - proton ( ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : variouspairs ] ) , the range has been shortened accordingly , to show that the distortion in the reaction zone is dramatically changed . indeed ,",
    "for the case of the proton  anti - proton , the magnitude of the local distortion effect may be large enough and in a direction such that a kinematic rearrangement of the particles may occur .",
    "in addition , because of the dependence upon the inverse of the square - root of the relative energy , these effects will be even more pronounced at lower relative energies .",
    "this kind of phenomena can be observed in the data obtained by wiese _ et .",
    "_ , @xcite on the breakup of the excited ion @xmath104 .",
    "this highly unstable ion of hydrogen decays in a two step process , as follows : @xmath105 the data ( see figure [ fig : probability ] ) show a slight asymmetry with small increases in energy ( from @xmath106 to @xmath107 ) which can be accounted for in a direct manner by considering the local distortion effects herein derived . to see this note that during the nearly co - linear breakup of the excited @xmath108 ion the `` initial '' proton @xmath109 is emitted in the forward direction and the doubly excited @xmath110 ion",
    "is emitted in the backward direction .",
    "the subsequent breakup of this ion occurs such that a `` final '' proton @xmath111 and the nearly equally weighted @xmath112 ion are formed.@xcite at this point the @xmath112 is preferentially associated with @xmath111 .",
    "however , after the breakup , the continuum pair ( @xmath113 ) will acquire a _ local momentum _ , @xmath101 , which has a component in the @xmath95 direction .",
    "hence this gained momentum will act to increase the radial separation and will push the @xmath112 over the coulomb saddle , so that it @xmath112 will be preferentially associated with the `` initial '' proton , @xmath114 . now , because the two protons are in fact indistinguishable , one will observe an asymmetry between `` low '' and `` high '' energy scattering events . to help visualize this process , a schematic diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : explain ] . ) has been developed .",
    "further analysis shows that , as mentioned above , because the local distortion depends upon @xmath115 , as the energy is increased , a proportionately smaller number of particles will experience an impulse that is large enough to alter their final state distribution .",
    "indeed , during the breakup of the @xmath108 ion , the magnitude of the local distortion effects experienced by the ( @xmath113 ) continuum pair while in the reaction zone are many orders of magnitude larger than the effects experienced by an electron - proton continuum pair .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hpbreakup ] ) with this understanding , one may conclude in a straightforward manner , that the observed asymmetry can be attributed to local distortion effects of the three - body system .",
    "moreover , the degree of asymmetry may be predicted as follows : @xmath116 therefore , with the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction , one may write , @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the probabilities of rearrangement for the high and low energy states , respectively . that is , using the actual data ( see fig .

    ", one may take the absolute square of ( [ eq : transformpsi ] ) and show that the _ imaginary_-part of the local distortion contributes a _",

    "[ sec : rearrange ] .",
    "specifically , the magnitude of the distortion effects for large scattering angles ( corresponding to the nearly colinear breakup of the continuum pair ) in the reaction zone may cause two opposite - sign - charged particles to increase their radial separation , and appear to repel one another .",
    "conversely , two like - sign - charged particles would decrease their radial separation , and appear to attract one another .    as a last exercise ,",

    "one can however venture outside of this realm and ask what energy and/or reduced mass is needed to obtain a measurable deviation from unity . if one uses the heaviest purely atomic species , either a proton - proton ( @xmath146 ) or a proton  anti - proton ( @xmath147 ) continuum pair , and assumes that a deviation of one part in a million can be measured , then the energy scale needed is on the order of @xmath148 !",
    "the variation of the term @xmath149 at these energies is shown in figure [ fig : phasevariation ] , and illustrates that one may detect a change in the absolute square of the wavefucntion , thus altering the relevant scattering amplitude .",
    "moreover , the exceedingly small energy scale required to detect these asymptotic distortion effects in either electron(or positron ) scattering from hydrogen or in electron - electron or electron - positron ionization processes provides a precise understanding for the success achieved in these areas while ignoring local momentum effects .",
    "in the above it has been shown that a generalized , position - dependent local momenta , which depends upon the congugate coordinate through the logarithmic gradient of a continuum state coulomb wave , may provide evidence for the manifestation of genuine three - body distortion effects in the reaction zone .",
    "the form of this local momenta was derived from a consideration of the exact three - body wavefunction , for the case when two of the three , mutually interacting , particles are far apart , and it indicates that the effects do not depend explicitly upon the location of the third particle . for this reason , the effects may be viewed as a distortion of the initial two - body continuum state wavefunction of the two remaining particles .",
    "this interpretation was adopted , and it was shown that the local distortion effects could be used to provided a rigorous , physical description of the observed asymmetry in the data obtained by wiese et .",
    "al . , @xcite on the breakup of three massive coulomb particles .",
    "the degree of this asymmetry was then predicted with an error of less than @xmath150 , and it was also shown that while the distortion effects were large in the reaction zone , the asymptotic form of the relevant two - body interaction may be retained by treating the local momentum acquisition as a three - body gauge constraint .",
    "furthermore , the evidence for detecting asymptotic variations in the @xmath151 range , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasevariation ] suggest that more experimentation be focused on these low energy , heavy - ion  atom processes .",
    "indeed , these experiments may yield new insight into a mechanism by which electrical forces may contribute to the fusion process !",
    "that is , the quantum - mechanical  impulse interpretation offered here shows that two like - charged particles may in fact attract one another due to local distortion effects in the reaction zone .",
    "in addition to these findings and predictions , one may learn much by noting that by adopting the proposed three - body gauge transformation , one finds that an electron - proton continuum pair exhibited a very small amount of distortion in the reaction zone .",
    "this result provides a rigorous explanation of why the paradigm 3c wavefunction works so well for light - ion  atom scattering @xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover , the general framework shows that an electron - electron continuum pair would experience distortion effects of lesser magnitude , due to its greatly decreased reduced mass .",
    "these results can again be used to explain why qiu et .",
    "al.,@xcite achieved amazing success in modeling electron - electron photo - ionization processes , while ignoring local momentum effects .",
    "indeed , if one recalls the path - integral interpretation suggested in sec .",
    "[ sec : rearrange ] , then the success of these findings for light - ion ",
    "atom processes may be attributed to the fact that the leading contribution to the relevant cross sections are the `` paths '' along which the local distortion effects are identically zero .",
