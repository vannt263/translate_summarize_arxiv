    "almost sixty years ago , fermi , pasta and ullam  @xcite presented a puzzling study of a many  body system which contrary to the intuition does not thermalize : the phase space is not ergodically filled .",
    "they studied an one  dimensional chain of point particles coupled by springs with a small nonlinear force .",
    "the chain is clamped , _",
    "i.e. _ , the particles at the ends do not move .",
    "fermi , pasta and ullam found numerically that the energy which was put into the lowest fourier mode almost completely stayed there , even after very long times , rather than being distributed over many or all modes .",
    "an understanding was achieved in a continuum limit which leads to a kortweg  de vries equation allowing for soliton solutions .",
    "a recent review can be found in ref .",
    "some years ago , kinoshita , wenger and weiss  @xcite studied a different but related problem in a real experiment .",
    "they made a quantum newton s cradle by letting two one  dimensional bose gases collide and oscillate against each other .",
    "once more , thermalization did not take place , the two bose gases kept their shapes even after many oscillations .",
    "subsequently this lack of thermalization was attributed to the integrability of the problem .",
    "this conclusion however was challenged later on  @xcite because the system is only weakly interacting and can thus be viewed as two systems ( the centers of mass of the two bose gases ) which collide without effect on their inner structure .    on the other hand , generic many body systems are expected to thermalise .",
    "the exact mechanism of the thermalisation depends on the details of system hamiltonian and has been extensievly studied by many authors , in particular in the condensed matter literatur , see e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent work and references    thermalization in the above sense is intimately connected to _ spreading _ and _ damping_. the former is very often seen in closed many  body systems that exhibit collective and incoherent single  particle motion .",
    "energy and momentum from one distinct  in the present context collective  state is redistributed into many other states .",
    "this has to be distinguished from _ damping _ as occuring in open systems . in the latter case ,",
    "the energy leaves the system because of coupling to a large or even infinite number of external degrees of , _",
    "i.e. _ , to an external bath . in the sequel , we have in mind closed , large , but finite systems .",
    "all degrees of freedom are internal , and we always talk about spreading .    among the numerous examples for spreading of collective motion in atomic nuclei  @xcite ,",
    "the giant dipole resonance is a very well  known one .",
    "the cross section of electric dipole radiation and the spectral density of the excitations show at a certain energy a huge peak whose spreading width is orders of magnitudes larger than the mean level spacing .",
    "a simple , somehow semiclassical picture helps to catch the salient features of this effect : the neutrons may be viewed as confined to one sphere , the protons to another one . there is no relative motion of the nucleons inside these spheres .",
    "the two spheres move against each other , thereby carrying out a fully collective motion .",
    "this results in an enormous response function .",
    "a bit further away from the resonance energy , relative motion inside the spheres sets in which lowers the cross section .",
    "much further away , all motion is incoherent of single  particle type , there is no collective motion anymore , and the resonance has disappeared completely .",
    "the giant dipole resonance inspired our choice of model in the sequel , but many other forms of collective motion and the assocciated spreading exist in nuclei .",
    "recently , examples for collective motion have also been found in bose ",
    "einstein condensates  @xcite and , as already mentioned , in ref .",
    "thus , one may expect that the issue of spreading will find renewed interest in this field .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to keep in mind that systems such as nuclei are selfbound , while systems such as bose  einstein condensates need an external confining potential . here , we restrict ourselves to selfbound systems , because we want to make sure that all effects we see are due to the internal dynamics and not possibly to an external confining potential .",
    "we numerically study the interacting many ",
    "body system whose more general aspects were analytically investigated in refs .",
    "our aim is to put forward the observation that , independent of integrability or non  integrability , spreading can be present or absent . at least for closed selfbound systems",
    "this clarifies that integrability is not the decisive system feature , rather it simply is crucial how the many particles are mutually coupled .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the model is introduced and the procedure of its numerical solution are discussed .",
    "we present the results for the integrable and non ",
    "integrable cases in secs .",
    "[ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] , respectively .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "we consider two clouds of particles in one dimension with coupling within each cloud and between the two clouds .",
    "the clouds are initially separated and then released , which does or does not lead to a spreading of the initial energy and momentum over all degrees of freedom . in the integrable case ,",
    "all interactions are harmonic .",
    "we add a forth  order term to also explore a weakly non ",
    "integrable regime .",
    "we largely use the model we introduced in the previous analytical investigations  @xcite . as it turned out convenient to slightly change some conventions for the numerical study",
    ", we compile all necessary formulae defining the hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec21 ] .",
    "we discuss the collective coordinate in sec .",
    "[ sec22 ] . the numerical method and the initial conditions",
    "are explained in the secs .",
    "[ sec23 ] and  [ sec24 ] , respectively .",
    "the two clouds , labeled @xmath0 , of @xmath1 point particles each with equal masses @xmath2 , move in one dimension .",
    "their positions are denoted @xmath3 , their momenta @xmath4 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath5 the first part is the integrable hamiltonian as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath6 the term @xmath7 makes the total hamiltonian   non  integrable .",
    "the first two terms of the hamiltonian  , @xmath8 model the two harmonic clouds @xmath0 before they are coupled .",
    "we notice that this definition is equivalent to , but differs from the one in ref .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 are taken from a symmetric and positive @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 and are assumed equal for both clouds . as already pointed out ,",
    "we focus on selfbound systems . here",
    ", we find it convenient to ensure this directly by using the translation invariant differences of the positions and the positive coefficients @xmath9 in eq .  .",
    "the two clouds are coupled with an interaction @xmath12 where @xmath13 this preserves the selfboundness since we choose the coefficients @xmath14 from a symmetric and positive @xmath10 matrix @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite we introduce the control parameter @xmath16 for tuning the overall strength ratio of the interactions within the clouds and between the clouds .",
    "we order the positions and momenta in two @xmath17 component vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the @xmath1 component vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it is helpful to cast the integrable case for @xmath22 into a more compact form . defining the @xmath23 positive , symmetric interaction matrix @xmath24 with @xmath25",
    "the potential becomes a standard bilinear form and we arrive at the expression @xmath26 to fix the notation , we write down the elementary transformation to normal modes explicitly .",
    "an orthogonal matrix @xmath27 diagonalizes the interaction matrix . for convenience , we write @xmath28 where the eigenvalues @xmath29 of @xmath30 are non  negative , because the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath15 have positive entries .",
    "in the rotated coordinates @xmath31 the system hamiltonian decouples into @xmath17 non  interacting ones , @xmath32 the positive quantities @xmath33 are of course the system eigenfrequencies . the coordinates",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are not positions and momenta of the particles , rather they are weighted linear combinations and can be viewed as positions and momenta of the non  interacting composite particles which define the normal modes .",
    "the transformation also facilitates an elementary solution of the equations of motions , allowing for a crucial check of our numerics later on .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we extended the integrable model and by adding a rather general translation invariant term @xmath36 which breaks the integrability but preserves the selfboundness .",
    "for our numerical study we make the special choice @xmath37 with a strength parameter @xmath38 and the fourth  order potential @xmath39 the coefficients @xmath40 are as well taken from a positive symmetric @xmath10 matrix @xmath41 .",
    "integrable interaction preserves translation invariance and selfboundness .",
    "we aim at studying the interplay between collective and incoherent single ",
    "particle motion .",
    "body systems show a rich variety of collective excitations , particularly nuclei provide a zoo of examples  @xcite .",
    "of course the way how the system is probed determines which collective modes are excited . as we have in mind excitation in which the two clouds are simply pulled apart and then released to oscillate against each other , the natural choice for the collective coordinate in our case is the difference of the centers of mass in each cloud @xmath42 although this definition is fully equivalent to the one we used previously , we notice that the collective coordinate @xmath43 in ref .",
    "@xcite differs by a factor , _ i.e. _ , we have @xmath44 . the time evolution @xmath45 of the collective coordinate",
    "is our most important observable .",
    "the larger the typical amplitudes @xmath46 of the collective motion after some time @xmath47 , the more energy and momentum are contained in the oscillation between the two clouds .",
    "the smaller the amplitudes , the more energy and momentum are transferred to the incoherent single - particle degrees of freedom within the clouds .",
    "importantly , the collective coordinate itself describes the most basic eigenmode of the whole system , apart from the simple translation without internal excitation .      for the numerical integration of the equations of motion we found it efficient to use the velocity verlet method , see _",
    "e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite , a standard method in molecular dynamics .",
    "we employed various well  established techniques and tests to implement it in an optimal way for our system .",
    "in particular , we carefully checked that the energy is conserved even for very long times beyond those we were interested in .",
    "as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec21 ] , we compared the exact solution of the integrable model with a direct numerical integration which turned out highly useful to eliminate even subtle errors . to further test the results of our simulation we validated that our numerical sumulation remains stable under time reversal transformation .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen such that the two clouds are separated and at rest at time @xmath48 .",
    "the initial particle positions @xmath49 are taken from two uniform random distributions around the arbitrary points , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , within the intervals @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] , respectively .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "if any two particles are assigned        the same coordinate , a new random position is chosen for one of them . in all our investigations , we used mirrored initial conditions ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , the symmetry @xmath54",
    ". the initial particle momenta @xmath55 are always set to zero when we investigate the integrable case in sec .  [ sec3 ] . only in the non",
    " integrable case to be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we work with non  zero initial momenta , preserving the mirror symmetry .",
    "each particle has a mass of @xmath56 .",
    "we begin by demonstrating in sec .",
    "[ sec31 ] the presence and absence of spreading in the integrable case . in sec",
    ".  [ sec32 ] , we give a first explanation by looking at eigenfrequencies and normal modes .",
    "we study the influence of the standard deviations of the distributions for the interaction matrix elements and of the particle number in secs .",
    "[ sec33 ] and  [ sec34 ] , respectively .",
    "we chose the entries of the interaction matrices @xmath57 and @xmath15 from independent gaussian distributions with means @xmath58 and standard deviations @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the parameters for our numerical simulations are given in tab .",
    "[ results : parameter_for_integrable ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     only the parameter @xmath38 is varied to investigate the impact of different perturbation strengths .",

    "integrable perturbation.,title=\"fig : \" ]   of the non ",
    "integrable perturbation.,title=\"fig : \" ]    case corresponding to @xmath22 is also shown .",
    "obviously , non  integrability helps the spreading considerably , for the strongest perturbation , the bottleneck is reached much quicker than in all previous simulations .",
    "however , as we demonstrated in sec .  [ sec3 ] , non  integrability is not a necessary condition for spreading .",
    "high sensitivity of the trajectories to slight changes in the initial conditions is the prime signature of classical chaos  @xcite .",
    "the proper measure is the lyapunov exponent . in this spirit",
    ", we now measure the distance in phase space of system trajectories which differ only slightly in the initial conditions .",
    "we look at the collective coordinate as well as on some single  particle trajectories .",
    "when varying the initial conditions , we carefully ensure that the total energy of the system remains unchanged to carry out a comparison on equal footing . to this end , we found it convenient to realize the changes in the initial conditions by modifying the particle momenta instead of the particle positions .",
    "we recall that in the above integrable case , the initial momenta were always zero . here , in the non  integrable case , one randomly chose particle is given a fixed momentum pointing towards the origin . to preserve the mirror symmetry of the system , the same momentum in opposite direction",
    "is given to the corresponding particle of the second cloud .",
    "furthermore , we go to two spatial dimensions to better visualize the trajectories .",
    "we look at trajectories of single particles , not of normal modes . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we present two     ( top ) and @xmath60 ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( top ) and @xmath60 ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]    single  particle trajectories which only differ in the initial conditions for the integrable case with @xmath22 and for the non  integrable case in which the perturbation is moderate , @xmath60 .",
    "as expected , the two trajectories stay very close to each other in the former and depart more strongly in the latter scenario .",
    "this has to related to the considerable impact of the perturbation on spreading .",
    "we expect the motion of the collective coordinate to remain largely regular  @xcite on local time sacles . in spite of this",
    ", energy and momentum must be redistributed to the incoherent , _",
    "i.e. _ , non  collective , degrees of freedom , because the amplitude of the collective coordinate decreases the faster the stronger the perturbation . to further investigate this",
    ", we look at the strongest perturbation with @xmath61 .",
    "we compare simulations with slightly different initial conditions . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we     at larger times .",
    "the ordinate is different from the one in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] where the short  time behavior is shown . ]",
    "plot the collective coordinates for larger times , beyond the time scale displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the first deviations are seen in the first shaded region .",
    "the two curves are then again on top of each other , before they depart once more in the second shaded region .",
    "this confirms that the motion of collective coordinate remains largely regular .",
    "the single  particle trajectories , however , show a much stronger onset of chaotic motion , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .     at shorter and larger times ( top and bottom ) ,",
    "the beginning and the end of the trajectories are marked with triangles , pointing upwards and downwards , respectively . filled and open triangles correspond to the two different trajectories.,title=\"fig : \" ]   at shorter and larger times ( top and bottom ) , respectively .",
    "the beginning and the end of the trajectories are marked with triangles , pointing upwards and downwards , respectively . filled and open triangles correspond to the two different trajectories.,title=\"fig : \" ]    at short times ,",
    "the two trajectories differ only little , but at larger times of about 10 seconds , they are completely apart .",
    "the number of circulations is the same , because the energies are the same for the two trajectories .",
    "thermalization in a narrower sense refers to systems of infinitely many particles . among others",
    "convenient features , infinite systems have the advantage of infinite recurrence times , at least in non  integrable cases .",
    "nevertheless , the concepts of spreading in closed and of damping in open systems of finitely many particles are initimately related to thermalization .",
    "they are of high practical relevance , since there are very many such systems , particularly nuclei , atoms , molecules and bose  einstein condensates . in parts of the literature , spreading , damping and thermalization are not cleanly distinguished , and the term thermalization is often used as some kind of hypernym .",
    "we studied spreading in a closed , selfbound many ",
    "body system for particle numbers large enough to ensure that the recurrence times did not spoil our investigations .",
    "we presented three main result .",
    "the first one is a clarification : the phenomenon of spreading and thus of thermalization in the above discussed generalized sense is not tied to chaotic motion .",
    "we clearly showed that integrable systems show or do not show spreading .",
    "thus , chaos is not a necessary condition .",
    "we explained this by discussing the rle of eigenfrequencies and normal modes .",
    "the details of the interactions are crucial , a normal mode corresponding to the collective coordinate in question has to exist and has to be isolated from the oher eigenfrequencies and , obviously , it must be excited by the initial conditions .",
    "our second main result is the subtlety of the effects .",
    "minor modifications of the relative strength parameters or in the distributions of interaction matrix elements can have large impacts . the particle number does not necessarily change the time scale on which spreading occurs .",
    "we then turned to a non ",
    "integrable case .",
    "not surprisingly , non  integrability , _",
    "i.e. _ , the onset of chaotic motion can considerably accelerate spreading .",
    "our third main result is the different behavior of the collective coordinate and of the single particles . in accordance with our earlier analytical findings ,",
    "the former continues to move in a largely regular fashion , at least locally , while the single particles show the onset of chaoticity much stronger .",
