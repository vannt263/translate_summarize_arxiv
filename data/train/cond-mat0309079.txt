    "it is convenient to work in fourier space , so we write @xmath18 with a similar fourier expansion for @xmath19 .",
    "the fourier coefficients of the ks response function , @xmath20 , can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the normalization volume , * g * and * g* are vectors of the reciprocal lattice , and the second sum runs over the band structure for each wave vector @xmath23 of the first brilloun zone ( bz ) . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are bloch eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the ks hamiltonian of ground - state density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , and @xmath26 are the occupation numbers , with due account for spin degeneracy .    in the above fourier representation , eq .",

    "im@xmath33 is therefore a maximum . throughout this work",
    "the plasmon - energy is taken to be the energy location of the main peak of the energy - loss function .",
    "the key ingredient in the calculation of the energy - loss spectrum is the ks response function @xmath34 of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we need the ks states which we obtain within the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , in terms of a variational expansion in the lapw basis @xcite : @xmath35 the lapw functions @xmath36 are obtained dividing the unit cell into two regions : non - overlapping atomic spheres centered at nuclear sites and the interstitial region between the spheres .",
    "this allows a faithful description of the localized strong oscillations near the atomic site , where atomic - like functions are used , and the smooth behaviour of the interstitial region , where plane waves are employed .",
    "local orbitals are also introduced in order to have an accurate description of the semi - core states .",
    "the use of the symmetry properties of the crystal allows us to work with bloch states that involve momentum transfers in the irreducible brillouin zone ( ibz ) instead of those in the whole zone .",
    "if @xmath37 is a vector of the ibz , @xmath38 where r(@xmath39 ) runs over the sub - set of the point group of the crystal that generates the star of @xmath40 and @xmath41(r ) is the partial lattice displacement corresponding to the space - group operation \\{r , @xmath41(r)}.    the evaluation of the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is performed with a code that runs in parallel and scales linearly with the number of nodes used . with the matrix elements at hand we perform the sum over k - points and over the pairs of bands allowed by the occupation numbers .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eq5 ] ) using two different approximations for @xmath42 . in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , @xmath42 = 0 .",

    "it s apparent that convergence is reached for the energy range under study ( the physics of the dynamical response above the m - edge will be the subject of another publication ) ; the results shown in figs .",

    "as anticipated at the outset , the overall loss functions of these transition metals bear little resemblance to the feg model , other than the presence of a broad collective mode ; again , the essentially overdamped mode which defines the leading feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfe ] corresponds to a dielectric function whose nature is quite removed from the simple , clean , drude - like zero which defines the textbook plasmon .",
    "additional peaks around 9 ev in ti and around 6 ev in sc arise from transitions involving the @xmath0-electrons and will be discussed elsewhere .    in order to investigate the dependence on the direction of the momentum transfer , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotr ] the alda dynamic structure factor s(*q * , @xmath62 ) for ti and sc along the ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) directions for q values of the same order of magnitude . dashed and dotted lines represent @xmath63 for * q*= 3/16(001 ) and * q*= 4/16(001 ) ,",
    "respectively , in units of 2@xmath64 .",
    "the calculation along the ( 110 ) direction ( solid line ) is for * q*= 1/16(110 ) , in units of 2@xmath65 .",
    "the curves along the ( 001 ) direction are calculated with a 8 x 8 x 16 sampling over the bz and the ones in the ( 110 ) direction with a 16 x 16 x 8 sampling @xcite . as the left panel on fig .",
    "[ fig : isotr ] illustrates , for both propagation directions the plasmon peak in ti hybridizes with fine structure due to @xmath0-electron transitions ( prominent peak and shoulder at its left , respectively ) .",
    "this hybridization is more pronounced along the hexagonal plane .",
    "for this reason , the identification of a plasmon peak for larger momentum transfers along this direction becomes very ambiguous .    in recent work @xcite , schne and ekardt",
    "have reported pseudopotential - based calculations of the dynamic structure factor for sc .",
    "the intriguing aspect of their results is that they suggest that the collective mode is not realized for small wave vectors for propagation along the hexagonal plane .",
    "by contrast , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotr ] the nature of the collective - like response in sc ( and also in ti ) is , for small wave vectors , quite similar for propagation directions parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal plane .",
    "our result agrees with intuitive expectations ; on that basis we submit that it is correct .",
    "[ fig : plas ] shows the plasmon - energy dispersion for both directions within rpa ( solid symbols ) and alda ( empty symbols ) .",
    "circles and squares correspond to wave - vector transfers that are perpendicular and parallel to the hexagonal plane .",
    "as expected , the alda plasmon energy shifts to slightly smaller values compared to that of the rpa , due to a less effective electron - electron interaction .    an interesting feature in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : plas ] is that , in the small wave vector limit , rpa and alda do not yield the same result , as it occurs in the feg .",
    "indeed , in the case of the feg , the coulomb term dominates over the exchange - correlation contribution when * q * @xmath66 0 . in the case of the _ ab initio _",
    "calculation , the difference between rpa and alda arises from the inclusion of crystal local - field effects and its interplay with the exchange correlation effects : for small wave vectors , * q * in eq .",
    "( [ sqw ] ) lies in the bz and hence , the element we consider after solving the matrix equation ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath67 is the * g * = * g*= 0 element ; thus , in this case * k * = * q*.    through the inversion process there is a `` mixing '' between large wave vector arguments * k*+*g * in @xmath34 and the small wave vector * q * of the plasmon , causing a shift of the collective peak to larger energies . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned before , exchange - correlation effects cause a downwards shift , smaller than the former one , provoking thus the difference @xcite .",
    "the partial cancellation between both effects leads to a net difference between the converged , alda result , and the scalar rpa result , for the small - q plasmon dispersion curve .",
    "ti and sc show positive plasmon dispersions and disperse faster along the hexagonal axis . for @xmath68 values larger than @xmath69 , the assignment of a collective peak in the ( 110 ) direction",
    "becomes a difficult task .",
    "by contrast , this assignment is still possible along the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "this fact ratifies , once more , the importance of the underlying crystal structure .",
    "we note that for ti , the plasmon energy ( @xmath58 19 ev ) is in good agreement with the one measured in reference @xcite for @xmath70=0.7 @xmath71 along ( 001 ) .",
    "we have presented results of calculations of the dynamic response function of hcp sc and ti based on a full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method .",
    "we have found that crystal local - field effects have a non - negligible impact on the plasmon energy for small wave vectors causing an interplay between the crystal potential and the exchange - correlation effects .",
    "we have investigated the dependence on propagation direction of the dynamical - structure factor and we have shown that , contrary to a recent report @xcite , the plasmon loss is quite isotropic ; however , the lineshape of the energy loss shows considerable dependence on the direction of the wave vector transfer : along the hexagonal plane , the identification of a dispersion relation for the plasmon energy beyond the small wave vector limit , becomes more difficult due to hybridization with the fine structure originated by @xmath0-electron transitions .",
