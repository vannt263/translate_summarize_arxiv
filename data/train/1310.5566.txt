    "these topological defects play an important role in magnetization reversal processes and magnetization dynamics of pma materials@xcite and , also , in the physics of phase transitions in 2d modulated phases.@xcite however , the experimental study of these topological defects in pma materials has been hindered by the problems to control their nucleation in extended samples since they usually occur within very disordered labyrinthine configurations .",

    "when perpendicular magnetic anisotropy @xmath3 becomes smaller than magnetostatic energy ( @xmath4 with @xmath5 the saturation magnetization ) , weak stripe domains are nucleated in the system@xcite above a critical thickness . in this case , the equilibrium domain configuration consists of a small out - of - plane oscillation of the magnetization of amplitude @xmath6 around an average in - plane magnetization @xmath2 that is aligned with the stripe direction due to the bloch character of the domain walls in between up and down domains ( see sketch in fig.1(a)).@xcite from a macroscopic point of view , coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane magnetization components gives rise to an in - plane pseudo - uniaxial anisotropy term called rotatable anisotropy@xcite since in - plane magnetization rotations imply a global reconfiguration of the whole stripe pattern .",

    "recently , experiments in weak pma magnetic lateral multilayers@xcite have shown an intrinsic coupling between topological defects occurring within the in - plane and out - of - plane magnetization configurations ( 1/2 vortices and 1/2 disclinations ) that could be of use to control the nucleation of topological defects in the magnetic stripe domain pattern .",
    "briefly , a magnetic lateral multilayer ( mlm ) is a continuous magnetic film with a lateral modulation of some relevant magnetic property e.g. @xmath9,@xcite exchange bias@xcite or anisotropy.@xcite pma lateral multilayers ( pma - mlm ) can be fabricated by introducing a periodic thickness modulation@xcite through a nanostructuration process since the equilibrium stripe domain configuration is very sensitive to thickness variations.@xcite lateral changes in sample thickness impose lateral changes in the period of magnetic stripe domains @xmath1 , in the amplitude of the out of plane oscillation @xmath10 and , also , in the average in - plane magnetization component @xmath2 ( see sketch in fig .",
    "therefore , the continuous film breaks up in a set of linear parallel regions with different equilibrium magnetic stripe domain configurations coupled through magnetostatic and exchange interaction to their neighbors .",
    "then , in the same way as the periodic magnetic stripe domain pattern in a continuous film is equivalent to a 2d crystal , the configuration of magnetic stripe domains in a pma - mlm can be considered analogous to a strained superlattice made up of alternating layers of material with different lattice parameter.@xcite thus , `` misfit '' between magnetic stripe domains at the different thickness regions becomes an essential parameter to understand the physics of this system .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the consequences of the pma - mlm fabrication process are to create an in - plane shape anisotropy and , also , to introduce `` edges '' within the continuous layer in which topological defects could be nucleated ( e.g. 1/2 vortices in the in - plane magnetization or grain boundaries within the magnetic stripe pattern ) . a good control of the essential parameters needed for nucleation of these topological defects would open the route to understand defect interactions on an individual basis ( in contrast with previous statistical studies in disordered patterns@xcite ) and , also , to study the physics of nucleation and propagation of the observed fractional topological defects ( coupled 1/2 disclination -1/2 vortex ) which is interesting for magnetic logic devices.@xcite however , in ref .",

    ": in the sample with a larger lateral period @xmath48 m , the effect of patterning is to separate the sample into a set of independent linear regions that switch by the propagation of head - to - head domain walls along them whereas in the sample with the smaller lateral period @xmath47 m , coupling between the different regions dominates and magnetization reversal is more coherent .          the behavior of pma - mlm s is much more complex when a magnetic field is applied in - plane and perpendicular to the nanostructured lines , and very interesting confined labyrinthine configurations appear within the stripe domain pattern due to the competition between the different anisotropy terms acting on the system .",

    "the samples have been saturated first with @xmath49 koe applied in - plane perpendicular to the patterned lines ; then , the field has been reduced to zero ( figs .",

    "4(e - h ) ) .",
    "all the samples present a similar remanent stripe domain configuration ( figs .",
    "4(a - d ) ) : stripes at the thick regions remain perpendicular to the lines ( i.e. along the direction of the last saturating field , as is the usual case in pma materials due to rotatable anisotropy ) but stripes at the thin regions have rotated away from the field direction towards the in - plane easy axis defined by the shape anisotropy created by the artificial thickness modulation .",
    "it can be seen that a number of `` misfit '' dislocations have been generated at the interfaces ( see insets in figs .",
    "4(a - b ) ) . due to the differences in equilibrium @xmath8 and stripe orientation in thick and thin regions ,",
    "stripe periods projected along the interface are also different ( see sketch in fig .",
    "thus , there are extra stripes that terminate on the interface and misfit dislocations are created . actually , since this happens on a periodic basis , the array of equispaced misfit dislocations can be considered analogous to a low angle grain boundary within the magnetic stripe pattern .",
    "then , upon applying a reverse perpendicular magnetic field ( figs .",
    "4(e - g ) ) , the rotation process continues within the thin regions until stripe domains become aligned to the nanostructured lines .",
    "however , in the pma - mlm s with @xmath51 m , stripe domains within the thick regions are still perpendicular to the nanostructured lines so that a set of 90@xmath52 boundaries has been induced within the magnetic stripe domain pattern of these pma - mlm .",
    "the configuration of these boundaries is quite different from the low angle boundaries observed in the remanent mfm images .",
    "the 90@xmath52 boundaries are decorated by high burgers vectors dislocations and dissociated 1/2 disclination pairs .",

    "4(f ) for a dissociated disclination pair made up of a + 1/2 disclination ( `` dead end '' ) and a -1/2 disclination ( `` branch '' ) that is equivalent to a dislocation with @xmath53 .",
    "the typical size of the observed disclination pairs is in the range @xmath1 to @xmath54 .",
    "these higher energy topological defects are needed to relieve the large mismatch in between the projected stripe periods at both sides of the boundary due to their almost perpendicular orientation.@xcite it is interesting to mention that it has been shown that + 1/2 disclinations in the magnetic stripe domain pattern are coupled to half vortices in the the closure domain structure for in - plane magnetization , that appears along the magnetization reversal process of the thick lines.@xcite    finally , it must be noted that a different behavior is found in the stripe domain configuration at coercivity for pma - mlm(0.5 ) ( fig.4(h ) ) : the whole stripe domain pattern in both thin and thick regions has rotated away from the applied field direction and is now aligned with the nanostructured lines .",
    "thus , the stripe configuration becomes much simpler without the high angle boundaries present in the larger lateral period mlm s .",
    "these different behaviors as a function of lateral multilayer period can be seen in more detail in fig .",
    "5 in which the field dependence of stripe domain orientation relative to the patterned lines is shown for pma - mlm(1.4 ) and pma - mlm(0.5 ) during a hard axis hysteresis loop ( squares and circles correspond to stripes in the thin and thick regions respectively ) .",
    "the angular orientation data have been extracted from the fast fourier transforms ( fft ) of a series of consecutive mfm images taken during the hard axis magnetization reversal process .",
    "briefly , topography images recorded simultaneously with the mfm signal are used as a mask to divide each image in two , corresponding to the thin and thick regions .",
    "then , the fft of each image is used to obtain the angular orientation of stripe patterns within each kind of patterned lines in a precise way.@xcite for the pma - mlm with wider lateral multilayer period ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) , stripe domains in the thin regions start close to the negative perpendicular orientation at negative fields ( which corresponds to the saturated state for in - plane magnetization in this hard axis loop ) and , then , perform a continuous rotation towards the positive perpendicular direction as the hard axis field intensity increases . these rotations within the stripe pattern",
    "are directly linked to the rotation that in - plane magnetization performs under the applied field torque.@xcite it is interesting to note the small overshoot that appears in this rotation process up to @xmath55 before the stripe domain orientation stabilizes close to @xmath56 for large positive hard axis fields , which is the typical behavior in stoner - wolfarth rotation processes under an applied field slightly misaligned with the uniaxial anisotropy hard axis ( by @xmath57 here ) . at the same time",
    ", stripes in the thick regions retain their original perpendicular orientation during the whole measured field range ( except for a possible @xmath58 indetermination ) . on the other hand , for pma - mlm(0.5 ) ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) , both thin and thick regions start close to negative saturation ( i.e. close to @xmath59 ) at negative fields but with a 30@xmath52 angular difference . then , as the positive hard axis field increases , stripes in both kinds of regions begin to rotate towards the easy axis , reducing the angular distance between them .",
    "once they reach @xmath60 , the stripe domains in the whole sample become coupled and rotate in unison for the rest of the hard axis hysteresis loop until they reach the positive saturation orientation @xmath61 .",
    "we may summarize the results of the mfm characterization in two points : first , the nucleation of high angle grain boundaries within the magnetic stripe domain pattern occurs mainly along hard axis magnetization reversal processes . in this geometry ,",
    "rotation of the in - plane magnetization component becomes the preferred magnetization reversal mode in the thin regions .",
    "due to the coupling between in - plane magnetization and stripe domains , the hard axis field acts as a handle to rotate the magnetic stripe domains in selected areas .",
    "thus , grain boundaries are nucleated within the magnetic stripe pattern at the limit between different thickness regions .",
    "second , in the pma - mlm s with larger lateral period @xmath51 m , grain boundary angle increases up to @xmath62 at the hard axis coercivity and 1/2 disclination pairs are observed .",
    "a more coherent behavior appears in pma - mlm(0.5 ) both along the easy axis and hard axis magnetization reversal processes .",
    "this indicates the stronger role of coupling between neighboring lines as the structural period @xmath0 is reduced down to values comparable to the magnetic stripe period @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic characterization of pma - mlm s has shown different possibilities to control stripe domain configuration making use of the coupling between in - plane magnetization and stripe patterns in weak pma films .",
    "now , in order to understand the observed experimental conditions for topological defect nucleation and their dependence on lateral multilayer geometrical parameters , we must consider the interplay between the different energy terms involved in the system .    a first approach to analyze the magnetization rotation in the thin regions during a hard axis reversal process in the larger period pma - mlm s can be made using a simplified model for in - plane magnetized mlms.@xcite in this case , only dipolar and zeeman energy terms related to in - plane magnetization components are considered ( @xmath22 in the thin lines and @xmath24 in the thick lines ) : the effective shape anisotropy created by the flux discontinuities that appear at the interface between thin and thick lines due to the lateral modulation of the in - plane magnetization,@xcite and the zeeman energy of @xmath63 , assuming that @xmath24 is fixed at @xmath62 . in this framework ,",

    ". a more complete analytical model should also take into account the energy density associated to the stripe domain pattern @xmath69 , exchange and magnetostatic energy terms associated to in - plane magnetization components @xmath70 , and the coupling between in - plane and out - of plane magnetization components , that takes the form of a rotatable anisotropy .",
    "regarding @xmath69 , it has been shown that the magnetic energy of the stripe domain pattern can be written as the effective elastic energy@xcite of a 2d crystal in terms of the deformations relative to the equilibrium periodic stripe domain configuration at a given field .",
    "within this framework , pma - mlm s can be considered as the 2d equivalent of strained superlattices since their stripe domain pattern is composed of alternating regions with different equilibrium stripe period , @xmath71.@xcite then , we may write their effective elastic energy as@xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the effective bulk elastic modulus of the stripe domain pattern within each region ; @xmath74 is the elastic strain in region @xmath75 due to the difference between the equilibrium @xmath71 and its actual value @xmath8 so that @xmath76 ; finally , @xmath77 stands for the energy of the grain boundaries between stripe domains in thin and thick regions .",
    "@xmath77 depends on the misfit strain @xmath78 between the stripe domain patterns at both sides of the boundary , @xmath79 since @xmath80 is the stripe pattern period at each region , projected along the grain boundary plane . for small enough @xmath78 , the grain boundary can be considered as an array of equispaced misfit dislocations with burgers vector modulus @xmath81 located at @xmath82 distance ( see sketch in fig .",

    "as @xmath29 goes down to zero , the amplitude of this out - of - plane oscillation increases and the in - plane magnetization component @xmath92 is reduced . as a consequence ,",

    "the first thing that can be noticed in fig.7(a ) is that , starting from pma - mlm(2 ) , the magnetostatic energy term , normalized by @xmath123 , increases as @xmath0 is reduced . on the other hand , both @xmath124 , which is proportional to @xmath77 , and @xmath89 decrease as the small @xmath0 region",
    "is approached ( figs .",
    "7(b - c ) ) .",
    "this implies that the system prefers to minimize these last two interaction terms as @xmath0 is reduced at the expense of adopting a less favorable configuration for the magnetostatic energy term .",
    "this can be seen in more detail in fig .",
    "7(d ) in which we have plotted the ratio @xmath122 vs. @xmath0 in order to compare it with the conditions that minimize each of these interaction terms . first",
    ", the magnetostatic energy term will be zero if @xmath125 , i.e. @xmath126 , which is calculated using the remanent magnetization values of the control films with thickness @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "second , grain boundary energy should be minimum if @xmath127 , which corresponds to @xmath128 .",
    "finally , exchange energy will be minimized if @xmath129 so that @xmath130 .",
    "it is seen that whereas pma - mlm(2 ) is close to fulfilling the magnetostatic coupling minimum conditions , the ratio @xmath122 departs towards lower values as soon as @xmath0 is reduced .",
    "then , when the strongly coupled regime of pma - mlm(0.5 ) is reached , the condition to minimize @xmath78 is fulfilled .",
    "this is probably a size effect since patterned line width @xmath131 m is comparable to stripe domain period @xmath132 m .",
    "thus , misfit dislocations can not be accommodated within the pma - mlm and stripe domains at the thin and thick regions become locked in a zero misfit configuration .",
    "the results of the analysis of the different energy terms involved in these pma - mlm s show three different regimes as a function of lateral multilayer period .",
    "first , there is a large @xmath0 regime , in which rotatable anisotropy ( which is a bulk energy term ) dominates and the pma - mlm s behave as continuous unpatterned films with their stripe domain patterns oriented along the last saturating field direction independently of its orientation relative .",
    "this regime would be favored both for large @xmath0 and small difference between @xmath22 and @xmath24 , i.e. for small thickness modulations , which would explain the absence of rotations found within the stripe patterns of pma - mlm s with @xmath133 nm and 0.5 @xmath26 m @xmath134 m in ref . .",
    "second , there is an intermediate @xmath0 regime , in which shape anisotropy induced by the thickness modulation overcomes rotatable anisotropy only in the thin regions and , thus , thin and thick regions switch independently during a hysteresis process .",
    "this is the most interesting regime to study topological defects in the magnetic stripe domains , since variable angle grain boundaries and disclinations are nucleated at the interfaces , coupled to domain walls for in - plane magnetization .",
    "finally , there is a small @xmath0 regime , in which coupling between thin and thick regions becomes strong enough to overcome rotatable anisotropy in the thick patterned lines and the film switches as a whole during the magnetization reversal process , under the effect of the in - plane uniaxial anisotropy induced by the lateral thickness modulation . in this regime ,",
    "misfit strain within the magnetic stripe domain pattern is minimized .",
    "this is related with the similar size of patterned line width @xmath131 m and stripe domain period @xmath132 m .",
    "thus , misfit dislocations and disclination pairs needed to nucleate variable angle grain boundaries in the stripe domain pattern become too large to fit within the interfaces between thin and thick regions since their size is of the order @xmath1 - @xmath54 , as observed in the mfm characterization .    in summary",
    ", the previous analysis has shown that the essential physical ingredients needed for controlled nucleation of topological defects within the magnetic stripe domain configuration are : first , the existence of localized `` misfit strains '' in the stripe pattern created by the local changes of @xmath1 due to the nanofabricated thickness modulation ; second , the competition between rotatable anisotropy and shape anisotropy induced by nanopatterning that allows local rotations of stripe domains due to their coupling with @xmath92 and , third , the use of large enough lateral geometrical features in comparison with the relevant topological defects to avoid size effects that would inhibit defect nucleation .",
    "in summary , the different regimes of magnetization reversal in weak pma - mlm s have been studied as a function of lateral multilayer period @xmath0 , both experimentally and with the aid of an analytical model , in order to establish the conditions for controlled topological defect nucleation within their magnetic stripe patterns . at @xmath51 m ,",
    "lateral patterning induces different reversal processes in the thin and thick regions so that they switch independently during easy axis and hard axis hysteresis loops : domain walls are created within the in - plane magnetization configuration coupled to variable angle grain boundaries and disclinations within the stripe domain patterns .",
    "this process is driven by the interplay between shape anisotropy induced by the periodic thickness modulation and the different values of rotatable anisotropy in the thin and thick regions . on the other hand ,",
    "as the lateral period is reduced down to @xmath135 m a strongly coupled regime is found in which the pma - mlm switches as a whole and misfit strain within the magnetic stripe pattern is minimized .",
