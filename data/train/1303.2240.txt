    "the interplay of short and long range interactions in a physical phenomenon leads to the existence of coherent structures that may  play an important role in the determination of the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of real materials .",
    "that is why highly sophisticated nonlinear _ lattice models _ taking account of long - range interactions have been extensively used to investigate the complex behaviour of many materials , from crystalline solids to rubber - like elastomers .",
    "these models lead to major achievements in the study of those phenomena where inherent characteristic lengths are a fundamental ingredient of the mechanical behaviour , such as fracture mechanics or nano - structures ( carbon nanotubes or bio - polymers ) .",
    "the mathematical models of atomic lattices involve large nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations and their treatment requires an enormous computational effort .",
    "moreover , it is hard to conceive that such equations may be amenable to a simple , yet detailed , mathematical analysis . on the other hand , _ standard continuum theories _  which assume that the lattice parameter is equal to zero  are more appealing than their discrete counterparts because they provide a powerful synthetic tool of analysis , description , and prediction .",
    "their weakness is that they become all but useless at short wavelengths ( a well - known example of this flaw is recalled below . ) hence the quest for _ quasi - continuum models _ , which generalize standard continuum mechanics to incorporate characteristic material lengths .",
    "a well - known example of quasi - continuum model is the so - called _ strain - gradient elasticity theory _ , which incorporates higher derivatives of the displacement .",
    "this theory is clearly connected with the higher terms in the naive ( taylor ) expansion in terms of small @xmath0 of a lattice . to reveal this connection ,",
    "let us consider the vibration of a single 1-d lattice , via the following hamiltonian @xmath1 ,   \\label{i1}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the displacement from equilibrium of the @xmath3th particle , @xmath0 is the equilibrium inter - particle distance , and @xmath4 is the inter - particle potential .",

    "mindlin @xcite introduced phenomenological strain - gradient theories of continuum mechanics in the early 1960s ; green and rivlin @xcite extended them to include strain - gradients of any order ; and toupin and gazis @xcite established a rigorous correspondence between strain - gradient theories and atomic lattices .",
    "equation presents an example of this connection .",
    "this equation is actually quite popular in all those applications of continuum mechanics where inherent characteristic lengths of materials may not be neglected , even though it is associated with several unpleasant problems .",
    "for instance , because of the presence of a fourth - order space derivative term , additional boundary conditions are required .",
    "also , the initial - value problem for is ill - posed .",
    "indeed , the associated dispersion relation is @xmath10 in the linear case , where @xmath11 is the speed of sound , @xmath12 is the frequency , and @xmath13 is the wave number .",
    "clearly here , instability develops at short wavelengths ( when @xmath14 ) .",
    "rosenau @xcite overcame this problem by starting from the exact dispersion relation for the linear discrete system , that is @xmath15 to deduce a regularizing expansion in the parameter @xmath0 , @xmath16 it is clear that equations and are equivalent at large wavelengths ( small @xmath13 ) , but not at short wavelengths ( large @xmath13 ) , where the latter remains bounded .",
    "now rewrite the continuum limit of as @xmath17 , \\quad \\text{where } \\quad d \\equiv \\partial_{x } ,   \\label{i8 } \\quad l_a \\equiv 1 + \\frac{h^2}{12 } d^2 + \\frac{h^4}{360 } d^4 + \\ldots\\ ] ] then observe that @xmath18 is an invertible schroedinger operator , with @xmath19 applying the operator @xmath20 to both sides of gives , up to @xmath8 , the equation @xmath21_{xx } + \\frac{h^2}{12 } u_{xxtt}.   \\label{i11}\\ ] ] in the linear limit , this equation possesses the ( bounded ) dispersion relation . also , the cauchy problem for this equation is well - posed and we do not require additional boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "rubin , rosenau , and gottlieb @xcite elaborated a phenomenological 3d counterpart to the regularization procedure of rosenau , by modifying the cauchy stress tensor @xmath22 and the free energy @xmath23 to include dispersive effects , while keeping the other thermomechanical entities ( the entropy , the internal production of entropy , and the entropy flux ) unchanged .",
    "destrade and saccomandi @xcite , @xcite recently showed that the material model of rubin , rosenau , and gottlieb falls within the theory of simple materials , which is a theory where the cauchy stress tensor depends only on the history of the deformation gradient .",
    "the consequence is that it is possible to introduce inherent characteristic lengths without having to introduce exotic concepts such as the concept of _ hyperstress _ , necessary to deal with strain - gradient theories .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a general treatment for the propagation of large amplitude transverse bulk waves in the framework of a phenomenological theory . hence we aim at generalizing the celebrated study of gorbacheva and ostrovsky @xcite , which presented results for the continuum limit of a one - dimensional lattice with elastic bonds under longitudinal stress .",
    "their results were obtained only for a special law of the elastic bond and for a single progressive wave ( in a continuum kdv limit of the lattice ) .",
    "here we consider a _",
    "general constitutive law _ for the strain - energy of the material and we also consider the possibility of _ nonlinear dispersion_. thus we expect to be able to extend the results of gorbacheva and ostrovsky to murnaghan s materials , to ogden s materials , and to many other popular phenomenological response functions .",
    "focusing on incompressible solids , and using the methods developed by destrade and saccomandi @xcite @xcite , we present the governing equations in section 2 and derive in section 3 a single complex wave equation for finite - amplitude transverse principal waves , valid for any dispersive solid . in section 4",
    "we specialize the equation to the case of a strain - hardening power - law solid , and discuss the influence of polarization , dispersion , pre - stretch , and strain - hardening .",
    "we find some exotic solutions such as pulses or kinks with infinite or even compact support .",
    "however the analysis soon reveals that these localized solutions are the exception rather than the rule .",
    "the analysis is exact and does not rely on regularized expansions .",
    "when we do perform such an expansion ( section 5 ) we recover , within an appropriate asymptotic limit , a `` vector modified korteveg - devries equation '' ( mkdv ) .",

    "note that is of the same form as when @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; here the first equality means that the material is _ non - dissipative _ , and the second makes the model compatible with the laws of thermodynamics , see fosdick and yu @xcite for details ( if we let @xmath45 , then we have the possibility to include dissipation as in the classical navier - stokes theory , but we do not pursue that alley here . ) the coincidence between and the model of rubin et al .",
    "is completed once we identify the dispersion material function @xmath46 with the derivative of the helmholz free energy @xmath23 which they introduced to model dispersion : @xmath47    now we restrict our attention to homogeneous , isotropic , compressible elastic solids .",

    "<S> we present a phenomenological approach to dispersion in nonlinear elasticity . a simple , thermomechanically sound , constitutive model is proposed to describe the ( non - dissipative ) properties of a hyperelastic dispersive solid , without recourse to a microstructure or a special geometry . as a result </S>",

    "<S> we show that for incompressible dispersive power - law solids and forth - order elasticity solids , solitary waves can however only exist in the case of linear transverse polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the influence of pre - stretch and hardening . </S>",
    "<S> we provide links with other ( quasi - continuum , asymptotic ) theories ; in particular , an appropriate asymptotic multiscale expansion specializes our exact equations of motion to the vectorial mkdv equation , for any hyperelastic material . </S>"
