    "if an object at cosmological distance is lensed into multiple images , the light travel time for individual images differs . for variable sources ,",
    "the differences are observable as time delays .",
    "the delays are of order @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lens mass and @xmath3 is the image separation ( in radians ) .",
    "as @xcite first pointed out , the effect provides an independent way of measuring @xmath4 .",
    "time - delay measurements have made much progress over the past decade and now at least 15 are available ( details below ) .",
    "while eq .",
    "( [ delay - order ] ) provides the order of magnitude , to determine the precise factor relating time delays and @xmath4 one has to model the mass distribution .",
    "an observed set of image positions , rings , magnification ratios , and time delays is generically reproducible by many different mass models .",
    "this results in a large model - dependent uncertainty on the inferred hubble parameter , even with perfect lensing data . to appreciate how serious this",
    "model - dependence is , compare the models of b0957 + 561 by @xcite and @xcite : the results are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , both at @xmath7 confidence ; the more general models in the latter paper yield _ larger _ error - bars .",
    "alternatively , consider the nice summary in fig .",
    "12 of @xcite of published @xmath8 estimates and uncertainties from individual lenses . among the lenses shown , b1608 + 656 has all three of its independent time delays measured , b1115 + 080 has two delays measured , whereas the others have one each .",
    "one would expect these two best - measured lenses to be the best constrained . yet",
    "b1608 + 656 has the largest error - bars on @xmath8 and b1115 + 080 the second - largest .",
    "this suggests that in the less - constrained lenses the real uncertainties are much larger , but have been underestimated because the fewness of constraints did not force sufficient exploration of model - dependence .    a general strategy for dealing with the non - uniqueness problem is to search through a large ensemble of models that can all reproduce the observations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will follow such a strategy , simultaneously modeling 10 time - delay lenses coupled by a shared hubble parameter .",
    "the basic method is the same as in @xcite and the accompanying _ pixelens _ code , but a number of refinements have been made .",
    "table  [ tablobs ] summarizes the lenses we have used . by ` type ' we mean the image morphology @xcite : ad = axial double , i d = inclined double , sq = short - axis quad , lq = long - axis quad , iq = inclined quad . in b0957",

    "each model in the ensemble consists of 10 pixelated mass maps and a shared value of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to reproducing all the observed image positions and time delays , the mass maps are required to satisfy a prior .",
    "errors in the image positions and time delays are assumed negligible , since they are much smaller than the range of models that reproduce the data . the details and justification of the prior",
    "are given in section  2 of @xcite , but basically the mass maps have to be non - negative and centrally concentrated with a radial profile steeper than @xmath24 , since the lenses are galaxies . with one exception the mass maps are required to have @xmath25 rotation symmetry ; only b1608 + 656 is allowed to be asymmetric , because the lens is known to contain two galaxies .",
    "a constant external shear is allowed for the lenses where the morphology show evidence of external shear ( all except b1608 + 656 , b1104181 , b2149274 ) .",
    "the lensing galaxies in b0957 + 561 and j0911 + 055 have cluster environments , but we have not treated these lenses differently . a concordance cosmology with @xmath26 is assumed .",
    "we have not included magnification ratios as a constraint , for two reasons : first , optical flux ratios may be contaminated by microlensing @xcite and differential extinction ; second , even tensor magnifications that is , relative magnifications along different directions inferred from vlbi maps are very weakly coupled with time delays @xcite , because magnification measures the local second - derivative of the arrival time .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions are available for some of the lenses , but we do not attempt to incorporate them , because current methods for doing so depend on strong assumptions about the mass distribution @xcite .",
    "there are five additional candidates we have postponed modeling .",
    "b1830211 has a time delay measurement @xcite but the lens position is uncertain @xcite .",
    "b0909 + 532 @xcite also has an uncertain galaxy position . for b0435122 @xcite and j1131 - 123 @xcite our preliminary modeling appeared to imply asymmetric lenses , whereas the image morphologies suggest fairly symmetric lenses .",
    "finally , j1650 + 425 had its time delay measured @xcite as this paper was being peer - reviewed .",
    "we remark that while _ pixelens _ in scientific terms is essentially the same as in @xcite , it has undergone several technical improvements .",
    "the key parameter in the code s performance is the total number of pixels ( not pixels per lens ) say @xmath27 .",
    "the memory required scales as @xmath28 and the time scales as @xmath29 .",
    "the maximum usable @xmath27 is in practice dictated not by time or memory but by the accumulation of roundoff error .",
    "our earlier paper attempted only 3 or 4 lenses at a time , going up to @xmath30 .",
    "after improving the control of roundoff error _",
    "pixelens _ can now go up to @xmath31 and beyond without difficulty .",
    "meanwhile improving the memory management and implementing multi - threading ( which parallelizes the computation if run on a shared - memory multi - processor machine ) and newer hardware have more than compensated for the @xmath29 increase in arithmetic .",
    "we have previously done two different tests of the general method . in @xcite",
    "the algorithm is tested by feeding time delays sampled from a model ensemble back into _",
    "pixelens _ and then recovering the model @xmath4 .",
    "this showed that any biases introduced by the ensemble - generating process have affected @xmath4 by less than 5% , but did not test the prior .",
    "@xcite presented a blind test where one author simulated data using simple model galaxies and a secret fictional value of @xmath8 , and the other author recovered that value within uncertainties using an ancestor of _ pixelens_. that provided a basic test of the whole procedure , including the prior , but still assumed that the models chosen by the first author for the test were representative of real lensing galaxies . a similar",
    "test using current galaxy - formation simulations is desirable but technically formidable ; however , we carry out a simple version of such a test below .",
    "our @xmath4 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ pg ] and may be summarized as @xmath32 at 68% confidence and @xmath33gyr at 90% confidence .",
    "this estimate neglects measurement errors in the time delays .",
    "however , we have verified by repeating the analysis with perturbed time delays that the effect of measurement errors is very small .",
    "astrometric errors are also very small .    fig .",
    "[ pg ] is consistent with the analogous figs .  8 and 11 in @xcite , which derive from 2 time - delay quads and 4 doubles considered separately . but",
    "the constraints do not improve as much as simple @xmath34 would predict .",
    "in fact , the uncertainties are far from gaussian , and some lensing configurations are much more useful than others .",
    "@xcite discuss this point in more detail and conclude that a 5% uncertainty on @xmath4 is possible using 11 lenses , provided the lenses all have favorable configurations .",
    "[ mass ] shows ensemble average mass distributions for the 10 lenses .",
    "notice that some lenses , especially b1115 + 080 , b1104181 , and b1520 + 530 , have twisting isodensity contours and/or radially - dependent ellipticities , features that are not included in parametrized models .",
    "the lens galaxies have varying amounts of dark matter .",
    "this follows from @xcite who compare the total - mass profiles of 18 lensing galaxies , including 6 from the present sample , with stellar - mass profiles from population - evolution models .",
    "( the work assumed @xmath35gyr which is well within our uncertainties , and hence the results are valid for the models here . ) from their table  1 we see that out to @xmath36 , b1520 + 530 is mainly stars , b1115 + 080 , b1608 + 656 , and b2149274 have significant non - stellar mass , while j0951 + 263 and b1104181 are dominated by dark matter .",
    "we now address a simplified version of the question : are our lens models typical of current galaxy - formation simulations ?    the details of gas dynamics , star formation , agn formation , and feedback on galaxy scales are still uncertain . with this caveat in mind",
    ", we consider a single high resolution galaxy , extracted from an @xmath37-body cosmological simulations and then resimulated using the treesph gasoline code @xcite including gas cooling , star formation , supernova feedback and uv background .",
    "the galaxy is an e1 or e2 triaxial elliptical with dominated by stars in the inner region but overall @xmath38 dark matter @xcite .",
    "orienting this galaxy randomly and ray - tracing with random sources @xcite we generated about 500 quads and 10000 doubles , and calculated time delays for each of these .    as eq .",
    "( [ delay - order ] ) suggests , time delays generated from a single galaxy will range over a factor of only a few , and can not be directly compared with the observed time delays , which range over a factor of 40 .",
    "we therefore consider a dimensionless form of the time - delay @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the lens - centric distances ( in radians ) of the first and last images to arrive , @xmath42 is the observed time delay between them , and @xmath43 is the usual distance factor in lensing .",
    "this factors out the dependence of the time delay on cosmology ( through @xmath8 and @xmath43 ) and on the scale of the lens ( through @xmath44 ^ 2 $ ] ) , leaving @xmath39 dependent only on the shape and steepness of the lens and on the source position with respect to the caustics @xcite .",
    "[ varphi ] shows the histograms of @xmath39 in our lens - model ensembles .",
    "the quads all peak around 2 , while the doubles mostly peak around 58 ; the exceptions are b0957 + 561 peaking around 3 and b1104181 peaking around 2 .",
    "since b0957 + 561 is in a cluster , it is plausible that the mass profile is unusually shallow , thus reducing the time delay through the well - known steepness degeneracy .",
    "the low value for b1104181 is more puzzling .",
    "[ andrea ] is simpler , showing the probability distributions of @xmath39 for doubles and quads generated by the single simulated galaxy .    figs .",
    "[ varphi ] and [ andrea ] are not quite equivalent , but we can think of both as derived from an underlying @xmath45 .",
    "each histogram in fig .",
    "[ varphi ] weights this probability distribution by observation selection effects and by the _ pixelens _ prior , and then marginalizes over galaxies while holding the lensing observables fixed . fig .",
    "[ andrea ] marginalizes over lensing observables ( separately for doubles and quads ) while holding the galaxy fixed .",
    "bearing this difference in mind , the simulated galaxy appears typical of our lens models .",
    "the most noticeable difference is the absence of observed quads with @xmath39 close to zero ; but that is an expected observational selection effect , because very short time delays are unlikely to be measured .",
    "we conclude that the _ pixelens _ prior , as far as this preliminary experiment can reveal , is consistent with galaxy - formation simulations .",
    "further comparisons with simulated galaxies and fine - tuning of the prior are desirable in future work .",
    "we have expressed our main result ( fig .",
    "[ pg ] ) preferentially in terms of @xmath4 rather than @xmath8 because the former appears more naturally in lensing theory .",
    "but it is interesting to continue with @xmath4 in comparing with other techniques , because @xmath4 has a simple interpretation quite generally : it is @xmath46 or the doubling - time for metric distances at the current expansion rate . coincidentally ,",
    "in the concordance cosmology ( @xmath47 ) @xmath4 also equals the expansion age of the universe , within uncertainties .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 estimates can be immediately compared with globular - cluster ages , such as in @xcite .      1 .",
    "@xmath48 from @xcite , who combine several different indicators calibrated using cepheids ; 2 .",
    "@xmath49 from @xcite , using snia distances calibrated using cepheids ; 3 .",
    "@xmath50 from @xcite , using the cmb fluctuation spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the hubble parameter appears in very different guises in different techniques .",
    "the distance - ladder methods measure the local cosmological expansion rate , independent of the global geometry .",
    "by contrast , in the cmb , @xmath4 is one parameter in a global cosmological model .",
    "lensing is different again : here one assumes a global geometry and then measures a single scale parameter .",
    "the same is true of sunyaev - zeldovich and x - ray clusters .",
    "the latter technique has made significant progress recently @xcite but thus far still relies on strong assumptions : spherical symmetry of the cluster potential and hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas . in principle",
    ", lensing time delays can determine the global geometry as well @xcite but the amount of data needed is not observationally viable yet .    whether lensing time delays can get the uncertainties in the hubble parameter down to",
    "the 5% level is an open question .",
    "maybe galaxy - lens models can be constrained enough to determine @xmath4 to better than 5% , thus making lensing the preferred method @xcite ; or maybe the approach is best used in reverse , inputting @xmath4 to constrain galaxy structure @xcite .",
    "fortunately , either outcome is worthwhile , and the basic technique will be the same .",
    "so whether the optimists or the pessimists are right , the usual cliches of `` more data ! '' [ time - delay measurements ] and `` more theory ! '' [ lens models ] are both apt .",
