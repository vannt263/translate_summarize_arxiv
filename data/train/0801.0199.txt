    "bill lawvere s 1973 milestone paper `` metric spaces , generalized logic , and closed categories '' helped us to detect categorical structures in previously unexpected surroundings .",
    "his revolutionary idea was not only to regard individual metric spaces as categories ( enriched over the monidal - closed category given by the non - negative extended real half - line , with arrows provided by @xmath3 and tensor by @xmath4 ) , but also to expose the purely categorical nature of the key concept of the theory , cauchy completeness . the first step to this end was to disregard metric conditions that actually obscure the categorical intuition .",
    "in fact , once one has dropped the symmetry requirement it seems much more natural to regard the metric @xmath5 of a space @xmath6 as the categorical hom and , given a cauchy sequence @xmath7 in @xmath6 , to associate with it the pair of functions @xmath8 lawvere s great insight was to expose these functions as pairs of adjoint ( bi)modules whose representabilty as @xmath9 is facilitated precisely by a limit @xmath10 for @xmath7 .",
    "hence , a new notion of completeness for categories enriched over any symmetric monoidal - closed category @xmath0 was born .",
    "also in the enriched category context it is often referred to as cauchy completeness .",
    "but since lawvere s brilliant notion entails no sequences at all , just the representability requirement for bimodules , this name seems to be far - fetched and , contrary to popular belief , was in fact not proposed in his paper .",
    "hence , here we use _ l - completeness _ instead .    in the first part of this paper",
    "we give a quick introduction to @xmath0-category theory ( see @xcite ) in the special case of a commutative unital quantale @xmath0 , focussing on the themes of l - completion and _ l - separation_. we are not aware of an explicit prior occurrence of the latter notion , and both themes are treated with the help of a new closure operator that arises most naturally in the 2-category @xmath11 , as follows .",
    "call a @xmath0-functor @xmath12 _ l - dense _ if @xmath13 implies @xmath14 for all @xmath0-functors @xmath15 ; the _ l - closure _ of a subobject @xmath16 of @xmath6 is then the largest subobject @xmath17 of @xmath6 for which @xmath18 is l - dense . for l - separated @xmath0-categories ,",
    "l - dense simply means epimorphism .",
    "the l - separated reflection of a @xmath0-category @xmath6 is its image under the yoneda functor @xmath19 , and its l - completion is the l - closure of that image in @xmath20 .",
    "the main part of the paper is devoted to a substantial generalization of the first part which , however , without the reader s recalling of the more familiar @xmath0-category context , may be hard to motivate , especially in view of the considerable additional `` technical '' difficulties .",
    "the quantale @xmath0 gets augmented by a _ topological theory _",
    "@xmath21 which now entails also a set - monad @xmath2 and a @xmath2-algebra structure @xmath22 on @xmath0 , with suitable compatibility conditions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while a @xmath0-category @xmath6 comes with a @xmath0-relation @xmath23 ( given by a function @xmath24 ) , @xmath1-categories come with a @xmath0-relation @xmath25 making @xmath6 a lax @xmath2-algebra . for @xmath2 the ultrafilter monad and @xmath26",
    ", @xmath27 provides barr s @xcite relational description of the category of topological spaces ( which , in turn , was based on manes @xcite description of compact hausdorff spaces ) ; for the same monad but with @xmath0 the lawvere half - line , one obains lowen s approach spaces @xcite , as shown by clementino and hofmann @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-to-@xmath1 generalization must necessarily entail the provision of a yoneda functor for a @xmath1-category @xmath6 .",
    "but what is @xmath28 supposed to be in this highly asymmetric context ?",
    "fortunately , this problem was solved in @xcite : the underlying set of @xmath29 is @xmath30 , provided with a suitable @xmath1-structure .",
    "this structure needs to be considered in addition to the free @xmath2-algebra structure on @xmath30 , leading to the surprising fact that the @xmath1-equivalent of the yoneda functor of the the familiar @xmath0-context has now two equally important facets . once one has fully understood this `` technical '' part of the general theory , it is in fact rather straightforward to extend the @xmath0-categorical results on l - completion and l - separation to @xmath1-categories , again with the help of the l - closure .",
    "we could therefore often keep the proofs in the @xmath1-context quite short , especially when no new ideas beyond the initial `` yoneda investment '' are needed .",
    "completeness of @xmath0-categories and the induced topology was also investigated by flagg @xcite ( who called them @xmath0-continuity spaces ) .",
    "an alternative approach to the categories of interest in this paper was presented by burroni @xcite .",
    "throughout the paper we consider a commutative and unital quantale @xmath31 . hence , @xmath0 is a complete lattice with a commutative binary operation @xmath32 and neutral element @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 preserves suprema , for all @xmath35 .",
    "consequentely , @xmath0 has an `` internal hom '' @xmath36 , given by @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
