    "the rich variety of galaxies in the local group ( lg ) provides an opportunity to study in detail the formation and evolution of the most common types of galaxies in the universe .",
    "one remarkable open question related to the evolution of dwarf galaxies is : are dwarf ellipticals and spheroidals the evolved descendants of previous star - forming dwarfs ?",
    "this hypothesis can be tested through the metallicity - luminosity relation for lg dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the key problem with this relation is that there are large uncertainties in the [ o / fe ] assumed for non star - forming galaxies @xcite . a way to address",
    "this problem is by deriving the chemical abundances of a significant sample of lg dwarf galaxies using emission - line objects , such as pne , which are present from early- to late - type galaxies .",
    "in fact pne and  regions have been used to address this issue by a few groups @xcite .",
    "our motivation for this paper is to contribute to such a study by discussing new spectroscopic data for ngc  147 from the gemini telescope .",
    "ngc  147 , together with ngc  205 and ngc  185 , is one of the three brightest dwarf companions of m31 . at variance with ngc  185 ,",
    "ngc  147 is gas and dust free .",
    "the amount of  in ngc  205 and ngc  185 is significantly higher than in ngc  147 , in which the  column density is at least a factor of 10 lower than in the other two galaxies .",
    "the dust clouds that are prominent in ngc  205 and ngc  185 are also lacking in ngc  147 @xcite .",
    "ngc  147 and ngc  185 have similar star formation histories and are dominated by their old stellar populations , while ngc  205 shows several peculiarities , including a younger population @xcite .",
    "the stellar metallicity of ngc  147 is relatively well known .",
    "based on deep v and i photometry of the central regions , @xcite has shown that ngc  147 is moderately metal - poor ( [ fe / h]=@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) .",
    "its colour - magnitude diagram indicates the presence of old red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , as well as some stars formed at intermediate epochs , like asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars about 5  gyr old . using rgb colours , @xcite give two slightly different metallicities for the inner ( up to 1.5@xmath8 from the centre ) and outer ( from 1.5 to 4@xmath8 ) fields of the galaxy , namely @xmath9 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "they point out that there is a weak tendency of increasing metallicity with galactocentric radius in the outer field . @xcite",
    "also stress the presence of an agb population with an age of several gyrs , and the absence of main sequence stars with m@xmath10 @xmath111 , suggesting that the star formation in ngc  147 ceased at least 1  gyr ago . on the other hand , @xcite used a four - colour photometry to analyse the late - type stellar content of this galaxy and that of ngc  185 , separating agb stars of different chemistry ( o- and c - rich , i.e. , m- and c - type stars ) . from the mean rgb colour indices ,",
    "they conclude that the metallicity of ngc  147 is [ fe / h]=@xmath12 and that of ngc  185 is [ fe / h]=@xmath13 .    in summary , following the above arguments and the work by @xcite , while ngc  147 and ngc  185 are very similar in terms of their stellar content , star formation history and absolute luminosity , their metallicity is different .    in this paper , we present the determination of chemical abundances in ncg  147 using pne .",
    "these data allow us to address some aspects of the chemical evolution of the galaxy , its consequences for the luminosity - metallicity relation of the lg dwarfs , as well as the properties of the pne themselves .",
    "in fact , it appears that ngc  147 and ngc  185 also have different pne populations : pne in ngc  185 are systematically brighter than those in ngc  147 @xcite . note that lower limits for the o / h abundances of the pne in ngc  185 and ngc  205 were determined by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the multi object spectroscopy ( mos ) data and their reduction are discussed in section  2 . in section  3",
    ", we present the derivation and analysis of the pne physical parameters and chemical abundances .",
    "these are then discussed in sect .  4 using different relationships , and in sect .",
    "5 they are compared with the stellar metallicity and the age - metallicity relation .",
    "section  6 is devoted to the luminosity - metallicity relation for dwarf spheroidals and irregulars .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section  7 .",
    "seven of the nine pne identified in ngc  147 from narrow band photometry by @xcite were observed spectroscopically using the gemini multi - object spectrograph north ( gmos - n ) .",
    "the pre - imaging needed to build the mos mask was also obtained with gmos - n on august 14 , 2005 .",
    "images were taken using a narrow - band   filter and a broad - band continuum filter r , whose central @xmath14 and @xmath15 are 655/6.9 nm and 657/83 nm , respectively .",
    "the exposure times were 2@xmath16300s in  and 2@xmath1660s in r. the seeing was @xmath110.7  arcsec .",
    "these images were used to produce a continuum - subtracted image to determine the position of the long - slits and to create a mos mask containing seven pne .",
    "in addition , a new pn was identified with the gmos pre - imaging and consequently inserted in the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the identification of the original 7 pne in the mos mask are those given by @xcite in their table  1 , and named pn1 to pn7 .",
    "the coordinates of the new pn , called pn 10 , are : r.a.=00 33 11.87 , dec=+48 28 11.7 ( j2000.0 ) . figure  [ gmos_im ] shows the image of ngc  147 , marking the position of the 8 pne studied in this work .",
    "the gmos - n in its spectroscopic mode was used in two different nights to obtain the pn spectra .",
    "the  red \" spectra were taken on october 31 , 2005 with the r400 + 5305 grating , in two exposures of 1800s each .",
    "as for the  blue \" spectra , data were obtained on december 3 , 2005 , with the b600+g5303 grating , in 2@xmath162800s exposures . in both configurations",
    "the slits widths were 1  arcsec , and the pixel binning was 2@xmath162 ( spectral@xmath16spatial ) .",
    "the spectral and spatial resolutions were : 0.3  nm and 0@xmath17.094  pix@xmath18 , respectively , with b600 and 0.8  nm and 0.@xmath17134  pix@xmath18 with r400 .",
    "the seeing during the `` blue '' and `` red '' spectroscopic observations was @xmath110.5  arcsec and @xmath110.7  arcsec , respectively .",
    "a cuar calibration was obtained with the b600+g5303 grating , but the only cuar exposure taken with r400 + 5305 was not good enough to be used for wavelength calibration .",
    "because of that , we have calibrated all the  red \" spectra using a list of skylines .",
    "this method gives a satisfactory wavelength calibration , thanks to the large number of skylines in the red part of the spectra .",
    "an exposure of the spectroscopic standard star g191b2b was taken with each configuration around the date of the observation of the spectra , and these exposures were applied in the flux calibration of our data .",
    "data were reduced using the gemini gmos data reduction script and longslit tasks , both being part of the iraf package .",
    "the selected slit length varies from one pn to another according to the field crowdedness . also , different slit distances from the bisector of the mask in the north - south direction correspond to a different wavelength coverage . typically , the ",
    "blue \" spectra covered a spectral range from 300350  nm to 570650  nm . in the case of the  red \" spectra , they covered from 500 - 620  nm to 9201050  nm .",
    "note that there is some wavelength overlap between the  blue \" and  red \" spectra . as an intense emission line was not always found in the overlap zone , we used the spectra of pn3 which contains the  line in both  red \" and  blue \" spectra to obtain a scale factor of 0.8 for all pne .",
    "this scale factor was applied to the fluxes measured in the  red \" spectra in order to get the fluxes reported in table  1 .",
    "in fact , from our previous experience with multi - object spectroscopy , we have noticed that differences of the scale factors are generally small , amounting to about 5 - 10% .",
    "we have also evaluated which is the error that we are adding to the measured fluxes due to the uncertainty in the matching .",
    "this error amounts to about 7% , which can be considered a characteristic measure of the uncertainty on the scale factors .",
    "note that in pn5 only the fluxes of the  495.9  nm and 500.7  nm lines were measured , so that this pn does not appear in the following analysis .",
    "errors in the fluxes were calculated taking into account the statistical error in the measurement of the fluxes , as well as systematic errors of the flux calibrations , background determination , and sky subtraction .",
    "table  2 shows the estimated percentage errors for a range of line fluxes ( relative to = 100 ) in each pn . here , and throughout the paper , quoted uncertainties are 1-@xmath19 errors .",
    "the observed line fluxes were corrected for the effect of the interstellar extinction using the extinction law by @xcite with @xmath20=3.1 .",
    "we used  as a measurement of the extinction , which is defined as the logarithmic difference between the observed and de - reddened  fluxes .",
    "since the  blue \" part of the spectra , which contains also the and  lines , is affected by larger uncertainties , the  was determined comparing only the observed balmer i()/i ( ) ratio with its theoretical value , 2.85 @xcite . for the higher signal to noise spectrum of pn4",
    ", whose  line was lost in the gap between two ccds , the i()/i ( ) was used to compute the extinction .",
    "the values of  and their 1-@xmath19 errors are shown in the last row of table  1 .",
    "is related to e(b - v ) through the following relation : = 0.4 r@xmath21 e(b - v ) , where r@xmath21=3.7 .",
    "the average value of the extinction of the pne @xmath11@xmath22=0.07@xmath60.07 gives e(b - v)=0.05@xmath60.10 , which is comparable with the reddening value e(b - v)=0.173 derived by @xcite toward ngc  147 , from dust infrared emission features .",
    "patchiness of dust and gas toward ngc  147 @xcite might be the reason of appreciable variations of the reddening throughout the galaxy area .",
    "the extinction - corrected intensities ( given in the middle column of table  1 ) were then used in order to obtain the densities and temperatures for each pn .",
    "as we can see in table  1 , @xmath23671.6,673.1 , usually used as an electron density estimator , was measured only in pn4 , pn6 and pn10 ( and an upper limit is given for pn1 ) . as for the temperature estimation , we were able to use the i(@xmath14495.9+@xmath14500.7)/i(@xmath14436.3 ) ratio , giving , for all the pne but pn10 ( also note that only an upper limit is given for pn6 ) . in the particular case of pn4 , two other temperature estimators were also used , namely i(@xmath14654.8+@xmath14658.3)/i(@xmath14575.5 ) for  and i(@xmath14372.6+@xmath14372.9)/i(@xmath14732.0 + 733.0 ) for .",
    "the derived electron densities and temperatures , and their errors , are listed in the upper part of table  3 .",
    "this is the first direct determination of the physical parameters of emission line objects in ngc  147 , which prevents us to perform any external comparison .",
    "chemical abundances were derived from the emission - line intensities using the ionization correction factors ( icf ) method .",
    "the icf were computed following the prescriptions by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the  436.3  nm emission line was measured with a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio in five pne , namely pn1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 7 . there ,  could be directly determined . in one case ,",
    "pn6 , we could estimate an upper limit to the  436.3  nm emission line , and consequently an upper limit to .    for pn  10",
    ", we could not measure this temperature diagnostic emission line , and therefore we could not derive its chemical abundances . finally , as noted before , in the spectrum of pn5 ,",
    "only the   doublet 495.9,500.7  nm could be detected , preventing any further analysis . in pn4 ,",
    "was used in computing chemical abundances with the icf method for ions which are ionized twice or more times , and  for singly ionized species .",
    "the icf method was applied to the six pne with an electron temperature measurement .",
    "formal errors on the icf abundances were computed taking into account the uncertainties in the observed fluxes , in the electron temperatures and density , and in the , as done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ionic and total abundances , as well as the ionization correction factors , are reported in table  4 .",
    "pne were also modelled using the photoionization code cloudy 95.06 @xcite .",
    "the complete procedure is described in @xcite . here",
    "we remind the most important parameters and assumptions .",
    "the input parameters for cloudy are _ i _ ) the energy distribution , _ ii _ ) the luminosity of the central star , _ iii _ ) the nebular geometry , _ iv _ ) the hydrogen density , n@xmath24 , and _ v _ ) the chemical abundances . at the large distance of ngc  147 ,",
    "pne are not resolved and we assumed the most simple geometry of spherical symmetry with constant density .",
    "the energy distribution of the central star was set to that of a blackbody ( bb ) .",
    "in fact , as described by @xcite , the model atmospheres by @xcite give similar results in terms of chemical abundance determinations .",
    "dust grains were added to the models , since they have an important effect , particularly on the temperature structure of the pne ( see , for instance , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this effect depends on the type of grain ( graphite and/or silicate ) , the grain abundances , and the grain - size distribution , being more relevant in the inner regions of the nebula ( see * ? ? ?",
    "dust type and size distribution adopted are those typical of galactic pne , with ism gas - phase depletion due to grains following @xcite .",
    "the bb temperature t@xmath25 was derived using ambartsumian s method @xcite , i.e. using the ( @xmath14468.6)/h i(@xmath14486.1 ) line flux ratio , or the ( [ o iii]@xmath14495.9+[oiii]@xmath14500.7)/@xmath14468.6 line ratio method @xcite .",

    "in addition , we made some tests varying the density by @xmath61000  @xmath28 with both the icf and cloudy methods , obtaining negligible changes in the computed abundances .",

    "subsequently , chemical abundances were varied to match the observed and predicted intensities within 5% for the lines brighter than   and 10% for the other lines . as explained above , we considered dust in our modeling .",
    "this inclusion came from the necessity of finding a good agreement between the empirical and cloudy temperatures .",
    "the abundances of c , o and fe ( the most important coolants ) were also slightly modified to refine the match with the empirical t@xmath29 .",
    "it is clear from table  3 that the model t@xmath29 is similar to the empirical one , with the exception of pn4 . in the latter case",
    ", we have three different empirical measurements of the electron temperature .",
    "our simple model with uniform density is not capable of reproducing the empirical temperatures , likely because of different conditions in different zones of the nebula .",
    "we therefore decided to reproduce just the the average of  and .",

    "[ o / fe ] is larger in dsphs than in dirs , reflecting the higher gas consumption rate of the  and therefore a substantially different star formation history .",
    "the [ o / fe]=0.44 of ngc  147 , computed adopting [ fe / h]=-1 by @xcite and solar abundances of iron and oxygen by @xcite , point in this direction .    in conclusion ,",
    "the offset in the luminosity - metallicity relationship indicates a faster enrichment of dsphs , and together with the different average abundance ratios [ o / fe ] highlights different star formation histories for these two classes of galaxies .",
    "using the icf method as well as cloudy photoionization modelling , we have analyzed new gemini mos data for the pne of ngc  147 , one of the most remarkable dwarf spheroidal companions of andromeda .",
    "the physical parameters and the elemental abundances of he , o , n , ne , ar and s , for the six brightest pne identified in this galaxy by @xcite have been determined .",
    "we find that , adopting the definition in the galaxy , there are no type  i pne in the ngc  147 , an expected result , since type  i pne are typically associated to younger and massive progenitors , while the predominant stellar population in this galaxy is old .    from the literature ,",
    "the comparison of the near - ir photometry of the agb stars in the three brightest m31 dwarf companions shows that ages of 1 and 0.1  gyr are predicted for the most recent star formation in ngc  185 and ngc  205 , respectively , while the last event that formed stars in ngc  147 occurred some 1 to 3  gyr ago @xcite . in terms of the stellar metallicity ,",
    "the three galaxies have similar median photometric abundances : [ fe / h]=-1.11@xmath60.08 ( ngc  185 ) ; -1.06@xmath60.04 ( ngc  205 ) ; and -1@xmath60.03 ( ngc  147 ) @xcite .",
    "our determination of the oxygen abundance for the pne of ngc  147 , is comparable ( within the uncertainties ) to those of ngc  185 and ngc  205 .",
    "the o / h abundance converts to [ fe / h]@xmath40=-0.97 , which is similar to the stellar metallicity of ngc  147 .",
    "this similarity between intermediate - age pne population and the old stellar population of the galaxy implies that no significant chemical enrichment has occurred during a long period of time .",
    "finally , the luminosity - metallicity for the dwarf galaxies of the local group is analyzed .",
    "we conclude that the location in the luminosity - metallicity diagram of dsphs exclude their formation from present - time dirs , and together with the abundance ratio [ o / fe ] points to different star formation histories for these two classes of galaxies .",
    "we would like to thank m. richer , the referee of this paper , for his valuable comments and suggestions which significantly improved the paper .",
    "we acknowledge m. perinotto for using his program to perform a fast evaluation of the chemical abundances that we then compared with our own evaluation .",

    "<S> the location in the luminosity - metallicity diagram of dsphs does not exclude their formation from old dwarf irregular ( dirs ) galaxies , but it does exclude their formation from the present time dirs , since the differences between their metallicities are already present in their older populations . </S>",
    "<S> the offset in the luminosity - metallicity relationship indicates a faster enrichment of dsphs , and together with the different average abundance ratio [ o / fe ] demonstrates the different star formation histories for these two types of galaxies .    </S>",
