    "coincide with the isgur  wise function @xmath9 , which describes the long - distance physics associated with the light degrees of freedom in the heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "this function is normalized to unity at zero recoil , corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "corrections to this limit can be calculated using the heavy - quark effective theory @xcite , and are suppressed by powers of @xmath11 or @xmath12 , where we use @xmath13 generically for @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "detailed calculations of these corrections lead to @xmath16 @xcite , @xcite@xcite and @xmath17 @xcite , so that an accurate determination of @xmath3 can be obtained by extrapolating the differential decay rates to @xmath10 . to reduce the uncertainties associated with this extrapolation , constraints on the shape of the form factors are highly desirable . a suitable framework to derive such constraints",
    "is provided by a dispersion technique proposed some time ago @xcite@xcite , and has been applied to heavy - meson form factors more recently @xcite@xcite .",
    "this method is based on first principles : the analyticity properties of two - point functions of local currents and the positivity of the corresponding spectral functions .",
    "analyticity relates integrals of the hadronic spectral functions to the behavior of qcd two - point functions in the deep euclidean region via dispersion relations .",
    "positivity guarantees that the contributions of the states of interest to the spectral functions are bounded above .",
    "the constraints on the relevant form factors , given their analyticity properties , then follow from these bounds .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we generalize this method to fully exploit spin symmetry in the doublets of the ground - state @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons . by taking into account all contributions related by heavy - quark symmetry ,",
    "this generalization increases the constraining power of the method considerably .",
    "we investigate all spin  parity channels ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) relevant for @xmath24 transitions .",
    "this gives us four inequalities and thus four allowed domains for the parameters which describe the form factors of interest .",
    "the optimal constraints are obtained by taking the intersection of these domains . although these different channels were also investigated recently by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , we bring a number of improvements to their analysis and exploit the dispersive techniques with a somewhat different emphasis .",
    "first , we include the contributions of the @xmath25 poles to the relevant polarization functions .",
    "since these contributions are positive , they reduce the domain available to the contributions of the @xmath26 states and therefore increase the constraints on the corresponding form factors . as a second improvement",
    ", we include the short - distance and @xmath2 corrections to the heavy - quark limit in the relations between form factors , thereby eliminating the leading uncertainties in these relations .",
    "we further discuss the role of remaining uncertainties and show how their inclusion is necessary to avoid overinterpreting the results of the dispersive method .",
    "in addition , instead of requiring rather complicated kinematical functions and the knowledge of the singularity structure of individual form factors , we introduce single - parameter descriptions that are simple , low - order power - series expansions in kinematical variables , and accurate to 2% over the full semileptonic domain .",
    "thus , these parametrizations will be very useful for reducing the uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath3 from experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the derivation of the unitarity inequalities , which are the basis of the dispersive bounds on form factors discussed in section  [ sec:3 ] . in sections  [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ]",
    ", we derive model - independent bounds on the heavy - meson form factors using expansions in different kinematical variables .",
    "we present a new method for including corrections to the heavy - quark limit , which fully takes into account the uncertainties in their calculation . we find that these uncertainties have a significant effect on the bounds and , ultimately , limit the accuracy of the dispersive approach .",
    "we also derive simple , one - parameter descriptions of the form factors in the semileptonic region .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of our results are discussed in section  [ sec : more ] , where the reader not interested in the technical details of our work can find a summary of our parametrizations for the @xmath0 form factors .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : ccl ] .",
    "the paper also comprises an appendix , where we give the definitions of form factors and details of our calculations .",
    "we start with the vacuum polarization tensor @xmath27 and a similar expression for the correlator of two axial currents with invariant functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where the subscripts indicate the spin  parity quantum numbers of the intermediate states contributing in the various channels .",
    "the invariant functions satisfy subtracted dispersion relations , which we write as ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31      = \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\int\\limits_0^\\infty\\!\\mbox{d}t\\ ,      \\frac{t\\,\\mbox{im}\\pi_{0^\\pm}(t)}{\\big(t+q^2\\big)^2 } \\ , ,      \\nonumber\\\\     \\chi_{1^\\pm}(q^2 ) & = & \\frac 12 \\left ( -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^2 }      \\right)^2 \\left[-q^2\\,\\pi_{1^\\pm}(q^2 ) \\right ]      = \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\int\\limits_0^\\infty\\!\\mbox{d}t\\ ,      \\frac{t\\,\\mbox{im}\\pi_{1^\\pm}(t)}{\\big(t+q^2\\big)^3 } \\ , .",

    "@xmath34 are given by unitarity relations .",
    "in the case of the vector correlator , we have @xmath35 and a similar relation holds for the axial correlator . the spectral functions , which are sums of positive terms , are bounded below by the contributions of the two - particle states @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , which are related through crossing symmetry to the matrix elements relevant for semileptonic decays . combining this lower bound with the qcd result for the correlators , we derive constraints on the form factors in the semileptonic region .",
    "these constraints are further improved by using heavy - quark symmetry to relate the matrix elements associated with these different contributions .",
    "note that , when extending the number of hadron states in the unitarity sum , there is , in principle , a danger of double counting if particles which decay via strong interactions are included . in our case , @xmath40 accounts partially for the two - particle state @xmath41 , which therefore must not be included separately .",
    "( @xmath42 is stable with respect to strong decays , since @xmath43 . )",
    "to further increase the constraining power of the dispersive method , we take into account the single - particle contributions of the first two vector @xmath44 and pseudoscalar @xmath25 mesons .",

    "these contributions are determined in terms of the masses and leptonic decay constants of these states , whose values can be calculated rather accurately using quark models . in table  [ tab : masses ] , we collect the masses and decay constants of all @xmath25 mesons below the threshold for @xmath45 production , as predicted by the model of ref .",
    "note that the scalar and axial states , as well as some of the vector and pseudoscalar states , have non - vanishing orbital angular momentum and therefore vanishing decay constants . although this conclusion is strictly only valid in the context of quark models , we expect orbitally excited states to have much smaller decay constants than s - wave states , and take the conservative approach of neglecting their contributions to the various spectral functions .",
