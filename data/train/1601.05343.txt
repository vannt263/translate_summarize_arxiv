    "of the 230 millisecond pulsars ( msps ) currently known in the galactic disk , 30% have been discovered in previously unidentified sources of gamma rays detected by the -lat instrument @xcite .",
    "while only around 10% of all known pulsars rotate at millisecond rates , msps make up half of all pulsars observed to emit gamma rays @xcite .",
    "the lat source catalogs have been instrumental in the search for new msps , providing spectral data to aid in distinguishing possible msps from other gamma - ray - emitting objects , such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "once an msp is discovered in a radio search and a phase - connected timing solution is available , the sparse gamma - ray photons are folded using the radio ephemeris in order to glimpse gamma - ray pulsations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while it was possible to search for radio pulsars in gamma - ray sources prior to the era ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the small positional uncertainty of lat gamma - ray sources has enabled single - pointing radio searches .",
    "overall , the search for msps in the galactic disk has been made extremely efficient by employing -lat data in selecting radio search targets .    before 2013",
    ", no msps had been discovered using the 305-m arecibo radio telescope in puerto rico .",
    "in contrast , the green bank ( gbt ) , parkes , nanay , giant metrewave ( gmrt ) , and effelsberg telescopes had been used to discover dozens of new msps using the 1fgl and 2fgl catalogs @xcite as guides . in this work",
    ", we present the first six msps discovered in unidentified lat sources using the arecibo telescope , along with preliminary orbital parameters gleaned from radio timing .",
    "we then quantitatively discuss the relative sensitivities  both in the flux density and acceleration regimes  between the -lat msp searches conducted at arecibo and those done at the gbt and parkes .",
    "all but two of the 34 candidates observed came directly from early versions of the third -lat catalog ( 3fgl , also known as the 4-year catalog ) , which was later published by @xcite .",
    "the two remaining sources were detected with the lat but were below the significance threshold required for inclusion in the final catalog .",
    "while lat source lists contain @xmath11000 unidentified gamma - ray emitters , several constraints dramatically limit the number of sources appropriate for our searches .",
    "every source had to be located within the declination range of arecibo ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "justification for picking the 327-mhz receiver over l - band , for example , was two - fold .",
    "first , the target source error circles were required to fit within arecibo s beam , allowing for single , long - duration pointings .",
    "the 327-mhz system , with a relatively large @xmath3 , was the best choice .",
    "second , pulsars have steep spectra , and therefore are brighter at such a relatively low frequency .",
    "very few pulsars are known to be variable in gamma rays @xcite ; thus , only non - variable lat sources were selected .",
    "also , each of the selected sources had a spectral energy distribution consistent with those of known gamma - ray pulsars , which typically have exponentially cut - off power - law spectra @xcite . because it is difficult to characterize lat sources amid the galaxy s diffuse gamma - ray background ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and because the effects of dispersion , scattering , and synchrotron emission inhibit radio pulsar observations at low frequency along the galactic plane , only sources with @xmath4 were considered .",
    "after whittling the list down , we obtained the 34 sources in table  [ tab : survey ] .",

    "each of the sensitivity curves has been scaled to 327 mhz using an assumed msp spectral index of @xmath100 @xcite . as an example of their relative power , for spin period @xmath101ms the arecibo searches are as sensitive at @xmath102pc@xmath103 as",
    "the gbt surveys are for @xmath104pc@xmath103 . for identical low dms ,",
    "the arecibo surveys are about twice as sensitive as the gbt searches . in other words , integration time at the gbt",
    "would have to be quadrupled to reach comparable raw sensitivities to arecibo  but such an increase in integration time would have deleterious consequences for the detectability of compact binaries .",
    "we list the radio flux densities for all discovery observations in table  [ tab : results ] ( these were obtained from an application of the radiometer equation and we estimate they have @xmath105 uncertainty ) .",
    "we see by comparison to figure  [ fig : sens ] that psrs  j0251 + 26 and j1824 + 10 could only have been discovered with arecibo .",
    "parkes could only have detected .",
    "this only considers raw telescope sensitivity ; it does not take into account sensitivity to high acceleration ( discussed later ) , which further emphasizes the utility of large telescopes .",
    "for a discussion of selection effects related to interstellar scintillation and eclipses , see @xcite .",
    "why has the arecibo survey turned up such a large proportion ( 5/6 ) of highly accelerated interacting binaries , compared to the fractions found in other -lat surveys ? though small - number statistics is a possible explanation , the result can likely be attributed to the arecibo telescope s very large gain , coupled with the relatively short integration times used , and the multiple - observation strategy used to search each good target .",
    "an integration time of just 15 minutes at arecibo yields a minimum detectable flux density that is substantially lower than the longer integrations elsewhere ( see figure  [ fig : sens ] ) .",
    "the population of -lat msps contains a disproportionately large number of interacting binary systems for reasons that are currently poorly understood . for a time , it was thought that a tendency for intrabinary shocks to produce high - energy radiation could bias -lat searches towards discovering these systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more recent analyses , however , have found little evidence to support this claim @xcite .",
    "the bias is likely due in part to previous surveys biases against finding binaries due to eclipses and acceleration .",
    "the use of modern acceleration search techniques ( as implemented within ` presto ` in our case ; ransom 2001 ) was essential for the detection of the five compact msp systems .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have explored the detectability of binary pulsar systems , the latter having expanded the former s work to include eccentric binaries .",
    "@xcite provide a quantitative measure of the loss of power due to acceleration by way of an `` efficiency factor '' , @xmath106 . squaring this value",
    "gives a ratio of the power in the m@xmath107 harmonic , which includes degradation due to acceleration @xmath108 and jerk @xmath109 , to the power that would be present were the acceleration zero .",
    "three such @xmath106 terms were reformulated in @xcite .",
    "the first , @xmath110 , describes the ratio that would be found in a `` standard '' pulsar search in which acceleration is not searched over .",
    "the term @xmath111 describes the power that would be recovered in a constant acceleration search ( like the ones we performed ) , and will be employed here .",
    "it is formulated as follows : @xmath112dt}\\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the integration time of the observation , @xmath113 is the pulsar s line - of - sight velocity , and @xmath114 is its angular spin frequency .",
    "a modern search algorithm yields values of acceleration @xmath115 and velocity @xmath116 that maximize @xmath117 . here ,",
    "@xmath118 for a system with constant acceleration .",
    "the final term , @xmath119 , describes the power ratio recovered in a search over velocity , acceleration , and jerk .",
    "such search algorithms are currently being developed , but have not yet been implemented .",
    "using software provided by @xcite , we calculated values of @xmath120 for during a 15-minute integration , such as at arecibo .",
    "we then recalculated these values using the integration times for surveys at the gbt and parkes to compare the detectability of this fast - spinning , highly accelerated binary pulsar by the four different surveys .",
    "results are given in table  [ tab : gamma ] .",
    "as expected , the power recovered in successively higher harmonics decreases for each of the four surveys .",
    "the value of @xmath120 in the first harmonic is a reasonable proxy for binary detectability ; that is , the higher the fraction of power that is recovered in an acceleration search , the more likely one is to detect the msp in a given observation . for , with a large and rapidly changing acceleration ,",
    "15-minute observations are significantly better at recovering power from a range of harmonics than longer integrations . comparing @xmath111 in the first harmonic between the 15-minute arecibo observation and the next - longest ( 32-minute gbt ) observation shows that arecibo yields a signal that is more than twice the strength of the gbt s ( not considering differences in telescope gain and system temperature ) .",
    "the difference becomes even more dramatic for successively longer observations . while longer integration times improve sensitivity , the effect is only proportional to the square root of the observation length , while telescope gain is a directly proportional parameter .",
    "one strategy to combat the effects of acceleration ( useful for relatively bright msps ) is to take a long observation and apply acceleration searches to small subsections of the data , as well as searching the entire observation .",
    "the characteristics of the arecibo telescope give it a two - fold advantage over similar instruments .",
    "first , it has a significantly better raw sensitivity than both the gbt and parkes for similar -lat source searches .",
    "we are therefore able to detect _ fainter _",
    "systems , even in the absence of considerations relating to binary systems .",
    "second , its large gain allows for short observations , which in turn increases its sensitivity to _ highly accelerated _ binaries , of which there are many among the source population .",
    "short observations also allow us to split observing time over multiple epochs , rather than integrating for a long time at a single epoch , further increasing our ability to combat eclipses and scintillation .",
    "though its declination range is limited , the arecibo telescope s raw sensitivity firmly establishes its indispensability as an msp - finding resource .",
    "h.  thankful cromartie would like to thank the nsf , fernando camilo , the staff of the arecibo observatory , and its resident scientists for the opportunity to pursue this research , and for an experience that compelled her to continue in astrophysics .",
    "the arecibo observatory is operated by sri international under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation ( ast-1100968 ) , and in alliance with ana g. mndez - universidad metropolitana , and the universities space research association .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",

    "<S> five of the six pulsars are in interacting compact binaries ( period @xmath0 8.1 hr ) , while the sixth is a more typical neutron star - white dwarf binary with an 83-day orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> this is a higher proportion of interacting binaries than for equivalent -lat searches elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that arecibo s large gain afforded us the opportunity to limit integration times to 15 minutes , which significantly increased our sensitivity to these highly accelerated systems . </S>",
