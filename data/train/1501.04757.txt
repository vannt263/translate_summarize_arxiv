    "almost forty five years ago , alder and wainwright @xcite reported , from a molecular dynamics simulation study , the observation of an asymptotic power law decay of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) of a tagged particle in a fluid at equilibrium . at long times",
    ", the vacf decays as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "they also proposed a simple hydrodynamic explanation , suggesting that the power law decay is due to the slow relaxation of the velocity vortex that is generated by the motion of the tagged particle in the fluid .",
    "theoretical analysis of this effect have been carried out since then using kinetic theory @xcite and also more phenomenological mode coupling theories @xcite .",
    "one of the main implications of the long time tails is that the time independent navier - stokes transport coefficients , as defined by the green - kubo relations , do not exist in two - dimensional systems , outside the limit of dilute gases , where the long time - power law tails disappear .",
    "granular gases have attracted a lot of attention in recent years , not only because of the rich phenomenoly they exhibit , but also because they are considered as a proving ground for kinetic theory and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the methods used for elastic molecular fluids have been extended to the case of particles colliding inelastically @xcite . in particular , hydrodynamic equations to navier - stokes order",
    "have been derived with formal green - kubo like expressions for the transport coefficients , both for dilute @xcite and dense granular gases @xcite .",
    "the low density expressions have been evaluated numerically by using the direct monte carlo simulation method @xcite and a satisfactory agreement has been found with the results obtained by the chapmann - enskog procedure applied to the inelastic boltzmann equation in the first sonine approximation @xcite . note that in the low density limit considered in these works , algebraical decay of the correlation functions are not expected , by analogy with molecular gases .",
    "we are not aware of any numerical evaluation of the formal expressions of the transport coefficients for dense granular gases , aside from the self - diffusion coefficient in a three dimensional system @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is not known whether the green - kubo like expressions for the transport coefficients of granular gases do actually exist beyond the low density limit in two - dimensional systems .",
    "due to dissipation in collisions , isolated granular gases ( or with periodic boundary conditions ) do not have an equilibrium gibbs state , but rather there is a time - dependent homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) .",
    "the navier - stokes transport coefficients of a granular gas are expressed as averages over the distribution function corresponding to the hcs @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is a relevant question to know whether time correlation functions computed in this state exhibit slow decaying long time tails .",
    "studying the existence of hydrodynamics in a two - dimensional molecular system can appear as a rather formal and academic issue .",
    "nevertheless , the situation is quite different when dealing with granular fluids . to reach and maintain them in a steady state ,",
    "a permanent energy supply is necessary .",
    "the usual experimental procedures are either by means of an external field or by injecting energy through the boundaries .",
    "the price to be paid is that the system becomes highly inhomogeneous .",
    "recently , a new possibility is being explored .",
    "the idea is to place a granular gas between two large parallel horizontal plates separated by a distance larger than one particle diameter , but smaller than two , in such a way that the system is actually a granular monolayer @xcite . to keep the system fluidized",
    "the horizontal plates are vibrated . then , the two - dimensional dynamics obtained by projecting the motion of the grains on an horizontal plane is observed .",
    "experiments show that the behavior of the projected system resembles that of a ( two - dimensional ) fluid . developing a self - consistent hydrodynamics for it seems an interesting and promising topic .",
    "of course , this requires the investigation of the decay of the fluctuations and correlations in the two - dimensional system .",
    "actually , an experimental setup very similar to the one described above has been already used to measure velocity correlations on the hydrodynamic scale in a two - dimensional granular gas @xcite .",
    "long time tails in granular gases have already been studied .",
    "kumaran @xcite considered sheared granular flows and reported the suppression of the power - law long time tail .",
    "also , the tail of the velocity correlation function has been analyzed in the stationary state generated by submitting the grains to an external noise force or thermostat @xcite .",
    "although the results are interesting , it is worth to remark that the possible relationship of this kind of forces with real experiments has not been established , and that the results depend strongly on the specific form of the used force @xcite .",
    "the case of an isolated granular gas has been investigated by ahmad and puri @xcite , by means of very extensive molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "although their results for the velocity autocorrelation function in the two - dimensional case seem to suggest the existence of a power - law long time tail of exponent @xmath2 , when time is measured by the number of collisions per particle , they can not be considered as conclusive , and no comparison with theoretical predictions is carried out . in ref .",
    "@xcite , several current autocorrelation functions have been investigated also in freely evolving granular fluids . using a mode - coupling theory",
    "it is found , in particular , that the vacf has a long time decay of the same form as in molecular systems , when again time is measured by the number of collisions per particle .",
    "moreover , extensive molecular dynamics simulation results are presented , and it is claimed that they are consistent with the theory , although again no quantitative comparison is carried out , other than the identification of a time region in which the behavior of the correlation function follows the power law predicted by the theory for the asymptotic long time limit . in the last two studies ,",
    "very large systems are considered , actually infinite in the theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that the hcs is highly unstable . in practice",
    ", this means that the state of the system departs from the hcs very soon , developing velocity vortices and later on strong density inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "consequently , the physical meaning of the vacf becomes rather uncertain after a very short period of time .",
    "in particular , there is no reason to expect it to be related in a simple way with the self - diffusion coefficient of the simulated system , if this coefficient exists .    in this paper , the decay of the velocity autocorrelation function in a granular gas in the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs )",
    "will be addressed .",
    "both in the theory and in the simulations only systems in that state will be considered , although the effects of the shearing instability as it is approached will be taken into account .",
    "therefore , in the systems analyzed here , the relationship between the vacf and the self - diffusion coefficient through a green - kubo formula is well established @xcite .",
    "although this implies the limitation to finite systems , it is possible to extrapolate the results and identify scaled behaviors that are independent from the size . in particular",
    ", this happens with the existence of a time window for which the vacf has an algebraic decay that is correctly predicted by a mode - coupling theory , not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ s2 ] , the definition of the self - diffusion coefficient in a granular gas in the hcs , and the steady - state representation of the latter , are summarized .",
    "it is important to stress that the existence of the steady representation is not an approximation , but an _ exact _ consequence of a change of variables . in particular ,",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient is also determined by the vacf in the steady representation . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , the mode - coupling theory of ernst , hauge , and van leeuwen @xcite is rederived for a finite granular gas with periodic boundary conditions in the hcs .",
    "the peculiarity of the hydrodynamic fluctuations , playing a fundamental role in the theory , and the effects of the shearing instability , are analyzed in sec .",
    "the existence of a time scale over which the vacf has a power law decay in time is shown in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] , where it is also discussed the exponential decay occurring in the asymptotic long time limit , due to the finite size of the system . in sec .",
    "[ s6 ] , the method used to take into account finite size effects when comparing molecular dynamics simulation results and theoretical predictions is described .",
    "the power law tails from the simulations are identified in sec .",
    "both , the power law and its amplitude are shown to be in quite good agreement with the mode - coupling predictions .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ s8 ] contains a short discussion of some relevant conceptual issues addressed in the paper , as well as some indications of possible extensions of the reported work .",
    "@xcite , the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath3 of a granular gas of @xmath4 inelastic hard spheres or disks of mass @xmath5 in the hcs is identified from the diffusion equation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number density of tagged particles at position @xmath8 and time @xmath9 .",
    "the formal expression of @xmath3 is given in terms of the vacf by the green - kubo formula @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the velocity of a tagged particle at time @xmath9 , and the angular brackets denote average with an initial distribution corresponding to the hcs of the system . upon deriving the above expression",
    ", it is assumed that the system remains in the hcs in the time interval between @xmath12 and @xmath9 .",
    "since all the particles of the system are mechanically equivalent , the vacf can be actually computed by using any of the @xmath4 particles in the system .",

    "then , it follows that the long time behavior of the thermal velocity @xmath23 of a granular gas in the hcs is given by @xmath24 in this expression , a modified cooling rate coefficient , @xmath25 which does not depend on time , has been introduced .",
    "it is convenient to change to a new time scale in which the intrinsic time dependence of the hcs can be scaled out in some way .",
    "this allows to formally eliminate one of the two time explicit dependencies of the vacf in eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) , making the theoretical analysis simpler and more direct @xcite .",
    "moreover , a direct molecular dynamics simulation of an freely evolving granular gas , as described by the dynamics in the actual phase space variables , has the limitation that the typical velocity of the particles becomes very small rather soon and , therefore , numerical inaccuracies become very large .",
    "this is a very serious difficulty when the interest is focused on the long time behavior of a property of the system , as it is the case here . to circumvent this problem , the dynamics of a system of inelastic hard spheres or disks in the hcs",
    "is exactly mapped onto the dynamics around a steady state @xcite .",
    "this is done by defining a new time scale @xmath26 by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two arbitrary constants .",
    "consistently , the velocity @xmath30 of a particle @xmath31 in the new time scale is given by @xmath32 the particle dynamics consists now of an accelerated streaming between collisions , @xmath33 @xmath34 while the collision rule in the new variables is the same as in the original ones , as a consequence of the linearity of the transformation given by eq .",

    "( [ 2.2 ] ) , becomes simpler in the steady representation , specially when the initial time is chosen such that the asymptotic steady state has already been reached .",

    "the coefficient of restitution has been always taken as @xmath161 , while the number density has been varied in the interval @xmath162 .",
    "the maximum and minimum density values in the interval correspond to densities studied by alder and wainwright in their seminal paper @xcite , so it is possible a direct comparison with their results for elastic systems . simulations with different numbers of particles in the range @xmath163 have been carried out for each density , modifying accordingly the size @xmath56 of the system . by estimating the critical wave number for the shearing instability of the hcs , @xmath111 , using the transport coefficients and the cooling rate obtained by means of the revised enskog theory for inelastic hard disks @xcite , it is found that in all the simulations considered , the minimum wave number allowed , @xmath123 , is significantly larger than @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , it was always checked in the simulations that the system remained homogeneous and with no appreciable velocity vortices .",
    "this latter condition is specially relevant in the present context , since the fluctuations of the transversal velocity play a dominant role in the long time , hydrodynamic behavior of the vacf .",
    "attention has also been paid to consider times such that the particles do not interact with their images in other cells . to avoid it , erpenbeck and",
    "wood @xcite suggested to consider times smaller than the time a sound wave takes to travel a distance equal to the linear size of the system @xmath56 .",
    "this criterium is adopted in most studies of the vacf , see for instance @xcite , and has also been used here .    in the simulations , the steady representation of the hcs discussed in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] has been used .",
    "although it is not relevant for the results presented below , let us mention that the value of the parameter @xmath29 was chosen such that , if the enskog theory were exact , the value of the steady temperature , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ 2.16 ] ) , would be the same as the initial one @xmath164 .",
    "in all the simulations , the applied procedure was as follows .",
    "the system was prepared in an initial spatially homogeneous state , with a gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "this initial state was allowed to evolve with the modified dynamics and periodic boundary conditions , until a steady state was reached .",
    "then , the vacf was measured .",
    "the results were averaged over several trajectories , typically a few hundreds .    as already pointed out , the prediction about the existence of a hydrodynamic period over which the vacf exhibits a power law decay in the @xmath26 time scale , and the specific form of this decay , do not involve the size of the system , aside from requiring it to be smaller than the critical size for the shearing instability , as it can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ 5.8 ] ) . nevertheless , when computing the vacf from md simulations , there are two main ( related ) reasons for which the finite size of the system must be taken into account to compare numerical results with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the first reason is due to conservation of the total momentum of the system @xcite , that implies that a given particle is actually moving in a fluid with a non - zero average velocity .",
    "the second cause is the difference between the ensemble in which the theory is developed and the one used in the simulations @xcite .",
    "both effects have been analyzed and quantified for molecular systems in equilibrium , but the arguments used in this case are not easy to extend to the present intrinsic non - equilibrium system with the particles submitted to an effective acceleration .",
    "then , an heuristic view will be adopted .",
    "it will be assumed , as it is the case in elastic systems , that both effects scale with @xmath165 to leading order , and the proportionality constant will be determined from the simulations themselves .",
    "of course , the simulations also provide a test , _ a posteriori _ , of whether the leading dependence on @xmath4 is indeed the assumed one .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the results obtained for the decay of the vacf in a system with density @xmath166 and different values of the number of particles @xmath4 are shown .",

    "this is not true , since an infinite system of inelastic hard spheres or disks can not exist in the hcs , because it is very unstable .",
    "what has been done is to take into account the conceptual differences between theory and md simulations , due to the use of different physical conditions as indicated above , realize that they scale with the inverse of the number of particles , and eliminate those differences to carry out a fair comparison .",

    "actually , the theoretical prediction for the amplitude of the tail for an inelastic system with @xmath161 is indistinguishable from the theoretical prediction for a system of elastic hard disks .",
    "however , the different physical nature of the states considered in both cases must be kept in mind .",

    "using mode - coupling theory , an approximate expression for the hydrodynamic , long time , part of the relaxation of the vacf of a finite granular gas in the hcs has been derived . the analysis parallels in several aspects",

    "first , the correlation function considered here corresponds to the modified dynamics defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) , in which the particles are submitted to an acceleration , as a consequence of a change in the original time scale . the new time scale measures the average number of collisions per particle , and plays a crucial role for the study of response functions in non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the self - diffusion transport coefficient of the granular gas can be expressed in terms of a one - time vacf computed in a steady state only in the modified dynamics .",
    "then , it is the time behavior of the correlation function in the modified dynamics the one relevant for computing the transport coefficient by means of the green - kubo expression .",
    "another important difference between molecular systems at equilibrium and granular gases in the hcs lies in the meaning of taking the thermodynamic limit in the md simulations . at a theoretical level ,",
    "the hcs can be considered and analyzed at arbitrary size , density , and value of the coefficient of normal restitution , and this legitimates its use as a reference homogeneous state . on the other hand , in the simulations",
    "a very serious limitation shows up due to the shearing instability . at fixed density , as the coefficient of normal restitution decreases , the size of the system for which the hcs remains stable decreases rather fast . at moderate densities ,",
    "only granular gases of inelastic hard spheres or disks with a very small number of particles can be simulated in the hcs .",
    "this limitation is specially severe when the interest is on the long time behavior of a given property , as it is the case here . actually , it is quite difficult to reach the time window for which the velocity - autocorrelation function has a power law decay for values of the restitution coefficient not very close to one .    to illustrate the effect of approaching the instability , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the vacf of a system in the hcs with @xmath191 is shown at three different times as a function of the inverse of the number of particles @xmath4 .",

    "the measured slope now is @xmath196 , which is two times the value for @xmath161 and the same density . on the other hand , for @xmath197 , a departure from the linear dependence",
    "is clearly observed .",
    "we expect this behavior to be due to the proximity of the instability and the presence of large fluctuations of the transversal velocity field , as predicted by the factor of @xmath198 in the addends in eq .",
    "( [ 4.18 ] ) .",
    "all the results reported in the figure correspond to states in which all the hydrodynamic fields were observed to stay homogeneous .",

    "the values of the slopes of the three lines are very close . ]    in two - dimensional molecular systems , it was realized that the analysis similar to the one reported in this paper , is internally inconsistent .",
    "the reason is that it is assumed in the derivation that a finite self - diffusion constant @xmath203 exists .",
    "but the asymptotic @xmath204 long - time tail of the vacf implies that the green - kubo expression for the self - diffusion coefficient diverges as @xmath205 .",
    "it is worth to mention that more refined mode - coupling theories using a time - dependent expression for the self - diffusion coefficient have led to the prediction that the @xmath204 decay corresponds to intermediate times , while a slightly faster decay , namely as @xmath206 is expected at later times .",
    "nevertheless , this has never been confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the view adopted here , and consistent with the results reported , is that the influence of the time tail on the _ observed _ value of the self - diffusion coefficient remains negligible over a time scale going well into the time scale in which the @xmath155 tails can be observed . on this scale , @xmath203 , given by the green - kubo expression ,",
