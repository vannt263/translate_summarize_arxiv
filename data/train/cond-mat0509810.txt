    "this results in an exponential arrhenius factor @xmath8 for the transition rate .",
    "the classical transition rate decreases rapidly with decreasing the temperature . at low temperature",
    "the above - described transport crosses over into the weakly temperature dependent quantum tunneling .",
    "a tunneling transition rate is essentially governed by the exponentially small and temperature  independent factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 describes the classical action for the motion through the inverted potential barrier .",
    "the strong sensitivity of the tunneling exponent against particle mass makes quantum tunneling more favorable for light particles as electrons , while the motion of heavy nuclei is classical down to temperatures of order of kelvin .",
    "however , for @xmath11k quantum tunneling displays itself in the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of atomic systems .",
    "one impressive example is amorphous solids , in which the low temperature properties are governed by the two - level systems ( tls s ) .",
    "these tls s are made of atoms or groups of atoms , experiencing a tunneling motion between pairs of energy minima separated by potential barriers @xcite .",

    "the quantity @xmath1 is exponentially sensitive to external and internal parameters of the system .",
    "this results in a logarithmically uniform distribution of tunneling amplitudes for various tls s @xmath15 this distribution of tls s leads to the universal temperature and time dependencies for various physical characteristics of amorphous solids , thus making \" glassy  behavior very easily recognizable .",
    "for instance , this includes the logarithmic relaxation in time of the specific heat @xcite and the non - equilibrium dielectric susceptibility @xcite .",

    "we hope that understanding the nuclear quadrupole interaction effects in glasses , which are sensitive to the internal tls structure , will help to resolve this question .",
    "recent experimental investigations of amorphous solids at very low temperatures have revealed a number of qualitative deviations from the predictions of the standard tunneling model eq .",
    "( [ eq : tlsmain ] ) .",
    "in particular , it is demonstrated in several works @xcite that , for @xmath6mk , the expected logarithmic temperature dependence of the dielectric constant breaks down and the dielectric constant becomes approximately temperature - independent .",
    "this result conflicts with the logarithmically uniform distribution eq .",

    ", one can assume that the distribution of tls s has a low - energy cutoff at @xmath17mk .",

    "these times ( a week or longer ) require much smaller tunneling amplitudes @xcite than @xmath18mk ( remember that the tls relaxation time is inversely proportional to its squared tunneling amplitude ) .",
    "we suggest the explanation of this controversial fact by using the recent model of wrger , fleischmann , and enss @xcite who proposed that the nuclear quadrupole interaction affects the properties of tls s at low temperatures by the mismatch of the nuclear quadrupole states in different potential wells ( see fig .",

    "this is very similar to the electronic spin tunneling suppression by the nuclear spin interaction in magnetic molecules @xcite .",
    "the significance of the nuclear quadrupole interaction has recently been proven experimentally in glycerol glass @xcite .",
    "this interaction helps to understand the anomalous magnetic field dependence of dielectric properties in entirely non - magnetic dielectric glasses @xcite .",
    "we show that an effective tunneling amplitude of tls having an energy less than its nuclear quadrupole interaction is remarkably reduced due to the mismatch of tls nuclear quadrupole states in its two energy minima , similarly to the polaron effect .",
    "consequently the spectrum of tls tunneling amplitudes @xmath1 possesses a pseudogap below the nuclear quadrupole interaction energy @xmath19 .",
    "dielectric and acoustic susceptibilities of glasses become temperature indepedent for temperatures belonging to this pseudogap because there is no tls with @xmath20 to contribute .",
    "thus our model explains the experimental observations .",
    "in addition , we predict that the application of a strong external magnetic field will reduce the mismatch of different nuclear quadrupole states and thus restore the logarithmic temperature dependence of tls susceptibilities . according to our theory dielectric glasses having no nuclear quadrupole interaction",
    "should obey the predictions of the tunneling model , which mostly agrees with the experiment .",
    "since a low temperature dielectric constant and a speed of sound in glasses have a similar physical nature they should have a similar behavior at low temperatures .",
    "therefore the saturation in the logarithmic temperature dependence of a sound velocity should be seen at @xmath21mk in materials possessing non - vanishing nuclear quadrupole moment .",
    "the situation with sound velocity measurements is , however , more complicated because it is more difficult to perform the low - temperature measurements for a sound velocity then for a dielectric constant .",
    "there exists a few measurements that we discuss together with the measurements of the dielectric constant .",

    "@xcite +    the experimental data indicating the strong changes in low temperature dielectric and , probably , acoustic properties are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the saturation in a temperature dependence of the dielectric constant below the temperature @xmath324 takes place in all materials containing na , k , al or ba which have relatively high quadrupole moments ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the high saturation temperature observed in bao - al@xmath288o@xmath323-sio@xmath288 is most likely due to large values of the ba and al quadrupole moments compared with the other elements in table 1 .",
    "the absence of the low temperature saturation in the dielectric constant of mylar is in the full agreement with the theory .",
    "indeed , mylar is an organic polymer composed of c , h and o atoms , for which the most stable isotopes have vanishing nuclear quadrupole moments . similarly according to the most recent experimental data @xcite",
    "there is no saturation in the temperature ependence of the sound velocity in @xmath36sio@xmath288 having no nuclear quadrupole interaction .",
    "a saturation in the low temperature dependence of the dielectric constant has also been observed in sio@xmath68 which poses a puzzle .",
    "one possible explanation is that unpaired electrons may be present in this material @xcite .",
    "they act like nuclear quadrupole moments in that aspect .",
    "the problem of interpretation of the acoustic experiment @xcite is a knotty one .",
    "if the same two - level systems control the acoustic and dielectric behaviors of the glasses , the saturation should take place below the same @xmath324 both for the dielectric constant and for the sound velocity @xcite .",
    "on one hand , there is no saturation in the logarithmic temperature dependence in @xmath339sio@xmath288 having no nuclear quadrupoles in agreement with the theoretical expectations .",
    "it is difficult , however , to understand the absence of any deviations from the standard tunneling model for the sound velocity measurements in bk7 down to @xmath18mk ref .",
    "although the major contribution to the dielectric constant and the sound velocity can be due to different subsets of tls s possessing either larger dipole moments or stronger elastic coupling to lattice vibrations @xcite , there must be some amount of tls s containing quadrupole nuclei and contributing to both dielectric and acoustic properties .",
    "these tls s should lead to an anomalous acoustic behavior .",
    "one possible explanation of the absence of any saturation effect is that the measurements have been made for @xmath340mk , while @xmath341mk ( see table 2 ) .",
    "an extension of acoustic measurements in bk7 to lower temperatures should help to clarify the puzzling situation .",
    "in this work we have considered various aspects of the effect of the nuclear quadrupole interaction on the low temperature properties of glasses .",
    "the significance of this interaction has been pointed out by wrger , fleischmann and enss @xcite . in the present paper",
    "this interaction has been employed to characterize the resonant dielectric susceptibility of amorphous solids at ultra - low temperatures @xmath6mk where major deviations from the predictions of the tunneling model are observed .",
    "the analysis of the typical interaction parameters shows that the nuclear quadrupole interaction is strong enough to explain these deviations . to our knowledge the materials having no nuclear quadrupole interaction and no unpaired electrons , i. e. the organic polymer mylar @xcite , and @xmath85-sio@xmath288 ref .",
    "@xcite do not show the deviations from the logarithmic temperature dependence of a dielectric constant or a sound velocity down to the lowest temperatures accessible experimentally around @xmath342mk .",
    "these results support our theory .",
    "our theory uses the fact that the nuclear quadrupole interaction is generally different in the right and left wells of a two - well tunneling system .",
    "therefore , it affects the coherent coupling between the wells .",
    "the overall quadrupole interaction effect is governed by the relative magnitude of two parameters , i.e. @xmath343 which is the characteristic nuclear quadrupole interaction strength of tls s consisting of @xmath22 atoms and the tunneling matrix element @xmath1 between the left and right wells . when @xmath2 , the nuclear quadrupole interaction can be neglected . at smaller tunneling amplitude",
    "@xmath3 the effective tunneling coupling is reduced exponentially due to the small overlap between different nuclear spin eigenstates in different wells .",
    "this is similar to the polaron effect and we use this similarity in order to suggest a solvable toy model based on the replacement of the nuclear spins with oscillators .",
    "the resonant dielectric constant is determined by the contribution of all resonant tls s with a characteristic tunneling amplitude of order of energy , which varies from the thermal energy to some characteristic maximum value @xmath344 .",
    "the deviations from the standard tunneling model are observed at temperatures comparable with the nuclear quadrupole interaction , i.e. , for @xmath345 .",
    "they show up as a temperature - independent plateau due to the breakdown of coherent tunneling in the energy range @xmath346 , where resonant tls s do not exist .",
    "therefore , tls s with tunneling amplitudes belonging to this domain do not contribute to the resonant dielectric constant .",
    "note that the hypothesis of the breakdown of coherent tunneling below @xmath347 has been proposed by enss and hunklinger @xcite assuming , however , that it is due to the interaction between tls s .",
    "our work suggests the valuable realization of their hypothesys .",
    "the results agree qualitatively with a number of low - temperature dielectric measurements made by different groups . to obtain quantitative agreement for the temperature at which the plateau forms , we have to assume that the relevant two - level systems consist of , at least , four atoms @xmath348 .",
    "this assumption agrees qualitatively with the tls model based on the renormalization group theory @xcite and is in line with molecular dynamics studies of glasses @xcite .    at very low temperatures @xmath267 ( @xmath349 )",
    "the plateau in the resonant dielectric constant should go over into a logarithmic temperature dependence characterized by the same slope @xmath350 as found at high temperatures , i.e. , for @xmath351 .",
    "therefore , it is worth while attempting an experimental observation of this behavior .",
    "it is unclear whether it is possible to perform measurements at such low temperatures at present .",
    "a comparison of the measurements with the theory can be used to estimate the number @xmath22 of tunneling atoms involved into single tls because the logarithmic width of the plateau @xmath352 is approximately equal @xmath22 .",
    "the nuclear quadrupole interaction should affect the sound velocity since it enters its resonant part in the same manner as to the resonant dielectric susceptibility . although it is clear from available experiments that there is a difference in the nature of tls s contributing to dielectric and acoustic properties , there are observed correlations between the two responses both in the hole burning and non - equilibrium dielectric measurements @xcite .",
    "we propose to extend acoustic measurements of glasses possessing atoms with nuclear quadrupole moments to lower temperatures in order to search deviations in the temperature dependence of a sound velocity .",
    "the most promising candidates are those materials in which the plateau in the dielectric constant is seen , including bk7 , @xmath333 k - sio@xmath288 and bao - al@xmath288o@xmath323-sio@xmath288 glasses ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we have also analyzed the dependence of the resonant dielectric constant on the external magnetic field .",
    "we show that a high magnetic field @xmath353 t affects nuclear spins stronger than the nuclear quadrupole interaction and therefore will restore coherent tunneling .",
    "this is because the nuclear spin states in the right and left wells get aligned parallel to the field .",
    "we have performed the model calculations of the dielectric constant in a magnetic field by combining numerical simulations for the behavior of a single spin affected by both a quadrupole interaction and an external field .",
    "the experimental verification of our theory can be made measuring the dielectric constant in the strong external magnetic field , which should eliminate the temperature independent plateau and restore the logarithmic temperature dependence .",
    "to our knowledge , most of experimental studies of the magnetic field effect on the dielectric constant have been performed at relatively high temperatures , i.e. , for @xmath354mk ref .",
    "these studies show certain similarities and also distinctions compared to our predictions .",
    "the major changes in the dielectric constant are observed at @xmath355mk .",
    "the application of magnetic field leads to an increase in the dielectric constant in agreement with expectations . at a certain magnetic field",
    "the dielectric constant of the standard tunneling model is restored .",
    "however , the change in the dielectric constant does not show a monotonous dependence on the magnetic field strength .",
    "a relatively strong effect is observed at very small fields ( for @xmath356mk and @xmath357 t ) .",
    "so , the behavior of the system is more complicated in this temperature range .",
    "perhaps , the relaxational contribution to the dielectric constant is still significant there .",
    "then , both the phonon - stimulated relaxation @xcite and the interaction - induced relaxation @xcite of tls s could be affected by an external magnetic field and our analysis would not be applicable .",
    "the experiments at lower temperatures @xmath355mk can test the model proposed here and can be used to characterize the internal structure and nuclear quadrupole interaction for a single tls .",
