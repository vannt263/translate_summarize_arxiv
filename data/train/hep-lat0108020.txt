    "one of the main goals of lattice qcd is to understand from first principles low - energy phenomenology as a consequence of chiral symmetry .",
    "recent advances in the formulation of chiral fermions on the lattice hold great promise for studying chiral symmetry of qcd at finite lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "neuberger s overlap fermion  @xcite , derived from the overlap formalism  @xcite , is such a chiral fermion on the lattice and has been implemented numerically to study the chiral condensate  @xcite , quark mass  @xcite , renormalization constants  @xcite , and short - distance current correlators  @xcite and to check chiral symmetry  @xcite and scaling  @xcite .",
    "however these studies are limited to small volumes due to the large numerical cost associated with approximating the matrix sign function . in this paper , we shall study physical observables , such as the pseudoscalar meson masses and pion decay constants , close to the physical @xmath10 quark mass .",
    "as such , we need to work on a lattice which is at least 3 times larger than the compton wavelength of the pion with the smallest mass in order to alleviate finite volume effects .",
    "we work on a @xmath0 lattice with @xmath11 as determined from the pion decay constant @xmath3 .",
    "this gives the lattice size @xmath12 and the smallest pion mass is @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the lattice size is @xmath14 times the compton wavelength of the lowest - mass pion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows",
    ". we will give the numerical details of the calculation in sec .",
    "2 . in sec .  3",
    ", we shall discuss the effect of the zero modes in the meson propagators . in view of the fact that the scalar condensate receives a contribution from the zero modes ( which goes away in the infinite volume limit ) through the generalized gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gor ) relation , the pseudoscalar correlator",
    "should also be contaminated by the zero modes .",
    "we have observed the effect of the zero modes in the pseudoscalar propagator at small quark mass . after clarifying the zero mode issue",
    ", we proceed to calculate the non - perturbatively determined renormalization constant @xmath1 from the axial ward identity and the pion decay constant @xmath3 .",
    "we find that @xmath3 is free of the quenched chiral log singularity and has a small error in the chiral limit .",
    "thus , it is a good quantity to set the lattice scale .",
    "we present the results in sec .  4 . in sec .  5 , we explain our effort in searching for the predicted quenched chiral logs .",
    "we see the chiral logs in the pseudoscalar masses , the pseudoscalar matrix element @xmath15 , and the @xmath16 ratio at very small quark masses .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "for neuberger s overlap fermion  @xcite , we adopt the following form for the massive dirac operator  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 so that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the matrix sign function and @xmath21 is taken to be the hermitian wilson - dirac operator , i.e. @xmath22 . here @xmath23 is the usual wilson fermion operator , except with a negative mass parameter @xmath24 in which @xmath25 .",
    "we take @xmath26 in our calculation which corresponds to @xmath27 .",
    "the massive overlap action is so defined so that the tree - level renormalization of mass and wavefunction is unity .",
    "the bare mass parameter   times the bare mass in @xcite . ] , @xmath28 , is proportional to the quark mass without an additive constant which we have verified numerically in a previous study  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the optimal rational approximation  @xcite to approximate the matrix sign function .",
    "the inversion of the quark matrix involves nested do loops in this approximation .",
    "it is found that it is cost effective to project out a relatively few eigenmodes with very small eigenvalues in the operator @xmath29 in order to reduce the condition number and speed up the convergence in the inner do loop  @xcite . at the same time , this improves chiral symmetry relations such as the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation  @xcite .",
    "however , it is shown  @xcite that the density of these small eigenmodes grows as @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the lattice spacing . as a result , it is very costly and impractical to work on large volumes with the lattice spacings currently used .",
    "there are simply too many small eigenmodes to be projected out .",
    "for this reason , we explore other options to clear this hurdle .",
    "we have tested the tree - level tadpole - improved lscher - weisz gauge action  @xcite and find that the density of these small eigenvalue modes is decreased to a point where it becomes feasible to go to large volumes with a lattice size 4 times the compton wavelength of the lightest pion .",
    "we further find that the anisotropic action  @xcite requires projection of more small eigenvalues in @xmath29 in order to achieve the same convergence in the inner loop than does the isotropic one .",
    "thus , we decide to use the isotropic action .",
    "we also find that using the clover action with either sign requires the projection of more small eigenvalue modes .",
    "therefore we use the wilson action for @xmath21 in the neuberger operator . on a @xmath0 lattice with @xmath32 tree - level tadpole - improved lscher - weisz gauge action , we project out 85 small eigenmodes . beyond these eigenmodes ,",
    "the level density becomes large . as a result ,",
    "the number of conjugate gradient steps is about 345 for the inner loop and about 300 for the outer loop .",
    "while the number for the inner do loop seems to be fairly independent of the lattice volume , the number for the outer do loop is about a factor of 2 larger than those for the wilson gauge action on small volumes  @xcite .",
    "since the conjugate gradient algorithm accommodates multiple masses with a minimum overhead , we calculated 16 quark masses ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 which are listed in table 1 together with the number of configurations for each mass .    .quark",
    "mass @xmath35 and number of gauge configurations are listed .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we see that @xmath4 obtained from @xmath36 is consistent with those determined from @xmath37 . combining all the fits from @xmath37 and @xmath36",
    ", @xmath4 appears to span the range from 0.15 to 0.4 which is consistent with that predicted from the quenched @xmath38 loop in the chiral perturbation theory in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] )  @xcite , although it tends to be on the high side .",
    "we note that the general behavior of our data is close to what are observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but our @xmath4 is about three to six times larger than theirs .    to alleviate the apprehension that the apparent singular behavior of @xmath36 may be caused by certain unknown boundary effect on the source in our lattice with fixed boundary condition , we consider the ratio of @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ f_p_g_pp ] ) and @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ f_pi ] ) @xmath39 this should cancel out the boundary effect on the source .",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath40 as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "we see from fig . 11",
    "that the singular behavior is still visible in @xmath41 which confirms that the chiral log singularity is indeed present in @xmath15 .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the chiral properties of the pseudoscalar meson on a quenched lattice with overlap fermions .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath0 with lattice spacing @xmath42 set by the pion decay constant @xmath3 .",
    "this gives a physical size of 3.0 fm which is about 4 times the compton wavelength of the lowest mass pion .",
    "we first clarified the role of the zero modes in the pseudoscalar meson propagator in association with the generalized gell - mann - oakes - renner relation .",
    "we find that the zero mode contribution to the pseudoscalar meson propagators extends to a fairly long distance in the time separation and it is imperative to avoid it since it is a finite volume effect .",
    "otherwise , one might be led to wrong conclusions about the behavior of the pion mass and decay constants near the chiral limit .",
    "for example , if one fits the pion mass by choosing a time window which straddles over the kink in fig .",
    "2 , one will find that the pion mass squared does not approach zero at the chiral limit with a linear extrapolation in the quark mass .",
    "interpreting it as due to the quenched chiral log , one may fit it with a chiral log form and obtain a positive @xmath4 which can be misleading . in view of the fact that the quenched chiral log fit of @xmath37 from data obtained from the shorter time range of @xmath43 as plotted in fig .",
    "5 has a much smaller @xmath4 than the present study and is consistent with that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , it would be useful to clarify that the shifted real modes ( the ` would be ' zero modes ) in the wilson action are not responsible for the observed quenched chiral logs in @xmath37 and @xmath36 in this case .",
    "due to the chiral symmetry of the overlap fermion , we obtain the non - perturbative renormalization constant @xmath44 from the axial ward identity .",
    "we find it to be fairly independent of @xmath45 which is an indication that the @xmath2 error is small .",
    "the renormalized pion decay constant @xmath3 has a positive slope with respect to @xmath45 . with a small error ( 1.6% ) and devoid of the complication of the quenched chiral log",
    ", @xmath3 is an ideal physical observable to set the scale of the lattice .",
    "we studied extensively the issue of quenched chiral log .",
    "we have clearly seen the quenched chiral log both in the pseudoscalar meson masses with equal quark masses and their pseudoscalar decay constants .",
    "various fits give @xmath4 to be in the range of 0.15 to 0.4 which is in accord with that estimated from the double @xmath46 propagator approximation of the quenched @xmath38 loop which predicts it to be @xmath47 .",
    "we finally have a reliable tool in the overlap fermion to study the chiral symmetry properties of hadrons at low energies including the quenched chiral logs .",
    "one should go to different lattice spacings to study the continuum limit in the future .",
