    "the statistical analysis of spectra aims at a comparison of the spectral fluctuation properties of a given physical system with theoretical predictions like those of random  matrix theory ( rmt ) , those for integrable systems , or interpolations between these two limiting cases .",
    "specific problems arise whenever the spectra under consideration involve a relatively small number of levels .",
    "this is the situation in the analysis of spectra of nuclei in the ground ",

    ", one usually deals with sequences of levels of the same spin and parity containing only 5 or 10 levels .",
    "several or many such sequences are then combined to obtain an ensemble of statistically relevant size .",
    "the sequences forming the ensemble may involve levels of different spin ",
    "parity and/or levels from different nuclei .",
    "the resulting data set is typically analysed with regard to the nearest  neighbor spacing ( nns ) distribution only . in view of the shortness of the individual sequences , correlations between spacings of levels are not investigated .    in the present paper",
    ", we address two problems which arise in the analysis of such data .",
    "first , we ask whether a fit to a histogram of the nns distribution is the optimal way to analyze the data .",
    "we compare this method with the method of bayesian inference which has been successfully used to analyze the statistical properties of coupled microwave resonators  @xcite .",
    "second , for a reliable analysis , one has to  unfold  the individual sequences .",
    "this yields a new data set with mean level spacing unity .",
    "then , one combines these level sequences to form a larger ensemble of spacings suitable for the statistical analysis .",
    "how big is the statistical error due to this unfolding procedure ?",
    "we answer this question for two extreme cases where the spacings are taken from a spectrum without ( with ) the long  range rigidity typical for chaotic systems , respectively .    in section  [ nns ] , we give a brief summary of the nns distribution and of spectral analyses using it . in section  [ baye ]",
    ", we give a short account of bayesian inference tailored to the problems just mentioned . in section",
    "[ anal ] , we address the above  mentioned two problems .",
    "section  [ summ ] contains a summary and our conclusions .",
    "the canonical ensembles of random  matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite are classified according to their symmetries . here , we focus attention on systems which are invariant under time reversal and under space rotations .",
    "such systems are represented by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices .",
    "the nns distribution of levels of the goe is well approximated by wigner s surmise  @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the spacing of neighboring levels in units of the mean level spacing .",
    "rmt was introduced originally to describe the spectral fluctuation properties of complex quantum systems .",
    "later , it has been conjectured   @xcite that rmt also applies to quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic .",
    "this conjecture has enormously widened the range of applications of rmt  @xcite and has led to a juxtaposition of rmt and of the theoretical description of quantum systems which are integrable in the classical limit .",
    "the latter possess a nns distribution which is generically given by the poisson distribution , @xmath2    there also exist intermediate situations . examples are ( i ) mixed systems where the motion in some parts of classical phase space is regular and in other parts , chaotic , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ; ( ii ) pseudointegrable systems which possess singularities and are integrable in the absence of these singularities , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ; ( iii ) fully chaotic systems where a conserved symmetry is dynamically broken , or is ignored .",
    "here we focus attention on case ( iii ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for a system with strictly conserved symmetry is block  diagonal .",
    "each block is characterized by a quantum number ( or a set of quantum numbers ) of the symmetry under consideration and may be separately considered as a member of a goe .",
    "symmetry breaking is modelled by introducing off ",
    "diagonal blocks that couple diagonal blocks with different quantum numbers .",
    "the resulting spectrum differs from goe predictions .",
    "such modelling has been useful in the following cases .",
    "( i ) isospin mixing in nuclear spectra and reactions  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) isospin mixing in the low  lying states of @xmath3al  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the gradual breaking of a point  group symmetry ( which is statistically fully equivalent to the breaking of a quantum number like isospin ) in an experiment with monocrystalline quartz blocks  @xcite .",

    "the statistical analyses relating to some of these cases can be found in refs .",

    "ignoring a conserved symmetry leads to a superposition of several goe spectra and to spectral fluctuation properties which are similar to those of the cases considered above .",
    "very strong mixing of states possessing different symmetries leads to a goe distribution , and the superposition of many goe spectra leads to a nns distribution which is poissonian .",
    "thus , there is a variety of physical situations that give rise to level fluctuations which are intermediate between the goe and the poisson cases .",
    "we attempt to describe the nns distribution in all these intermediate situations by a one  parameter family of functions interpolating between expressions  ( [ 0 ] ) and ( [ p ] ) .",
    "this family is defined in section  [ prop ] .",
    "we are aware of the fact that our procedure can not be exact .",
    "arguments will be given to justify its use but it remains an approximation .",
    "the bayesian analysis of the nns distribution proceeds in three steps .",
    "( i ) we propose a probability distribution @xmath4 for the observed spacings @xmath1 of nearest neighbors .",
    "this function depends parametrically upon the parameter @xmath5 which measures the deviation from goe statistics .",
    "it is our aim to determine @xmath5 from the data .",
    "( ii ) we determine the posterior distribution @xmath6 for the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "( iii ) we deduce the optimum value of @xmath5 together with its statistical error .",
    "the three steps are outlined in the three subsections which follow .      to construct @xmath4",
    ", we consider a spectrum @xmath7 containing levels of the same spin and parity .",
    "( in practice , we usually deal with a set of spectra but consider only a single one in the present section .",
    "the generalisation to a set of spectra is considered in section  [ 4.2 ] ) .",
    "the levels in @xmath7 may , however , differ in other conserved quantum numbers which are either unknown or ignored .",
    "the spectrum @xmath7 can then be broken up into @xmath8 sub ",
    "spectra @xmath9 of independent sequences of levels , with @xmath10 . the fractional level number of @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 let @xmath14 denote the nns distribution for the sub  spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that each of the distributions @xmath15 is given by the goe and has unit mean level spacing . to an excellent approximation ,",
    "the @xmath16 s are then given by wigner s surmise  ( 1 ) .    the construction of the nns distribution @xmath17 for the superposition spectrum @xmath7 ( with unit mean level spacing ) from the @xmath15 s was explicitly carried out by rosenzweig and porter  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath4 approaches the nns of the goe .",
    "this is why we refer to @xmath5 as to the chaoticity parameter .",
    "we use @xmath24 as defined above for the analysis of the data .",
    "our model for @xmath24 has been constructed with case ( iii ) of section  [ nns ] in mind , even when the symmetries are only weakly broken . in that case , the distribution  ( [ 10 ] ) is not accurate for very small spacings because @xmath24 differs from zero at @xmath25 while the symmetry ",
    "breaking interaction lifts all degeneracies .",
    "however , this defect should not affect the spacing distribution beyond the domain of very small spacings .",
    "the magnitude of this domain depends on the ratio of the strength of the symmetry  breaking interaction to the mean level spacing .    for the other cases of intermediate situations mentioned in section  [ nns ]",
    ", our model may not be the best choice .",
    "the experimental nns distributions of mixed systems ( case ( i ) ) are frequently analyzed using brody s interpolation formula  @xcite , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a fit parameter and @xmath28 ^{\\gamma + 1}$ ] , although eq .",

    "we take the experimental @xmath35 to be statistically independent .",
    "this assumption does not apply in general .",
    "indeed , the goe produces significant correlations between subsequent spacings .",

    "3 of  @xcite , but a useful approximation .",
    "in the present section we address the unfolding procedure for a large number of short sequences of level spacings .",
    "we do so for two cases : we study short sequences of levels that do not ( do ) possess the rigidity of goe spectra .",
    "this is done in subsections  [ surr ] ( [ 4.2 ] , respectively ) .",
    "we show that unfolding leads to an overestimation of the chaoticity parameter in the first but not in the second case .",
    "thus , long  range order is important for a reliable unfolding . in subsection  ( [ expl ] )",
    "we comment on this point .",
    "short sequences that lack goe rigidity are taken from what we call the surrogate ensemble , a set of statistically independent spacings obtained with the help of a random  number generator . with this ensemble",
    "we also test ( in section  [ test ] ) the method of statistical analysis defined in section  [ baye ] .      to obtain the uniform surrogate ensembles , we generate a set of random numbers @xmath51 from a distribution with unit density between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "one obtains @xmath58 in this way we generate three surrogate ensembles of 50 , 100 , and 200 spacings , respectively .    in each ensemble",
    "these spacings are statistically independent , have mean spacing unity , and follow the distribution eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the expression `` uniform ensemble '' refers to the uniform statistical properties of the spacings .",
    "a spectrum constructed from a sequence of such spacings lacks the rigidity of goe spectra .    the value @xmath59 is referred to as the `` true '' value of @xmath5 .",
    "it is checked in section  [ test ] below whether a statistical analysis of short sequences of spacings does reproduce this value .",
    "we use the three surrogate ensembles to compare two methods of statistical inference : ( i ) we fit the conditional distribution  ( [ 10 ] ) to a histogram of the spacings and ( ii ) we use the bayesian method .",
    "\\(i ) the bin size for the histograms was taken once equal to 0.2 and once equal to 0.3 .",
    "we determine the chaoticity parameter @xmath5 for each of the six histograms by a chi  squared fit to the nns distribution  ( [ 10 ] ) .",

    "( [ 12 ] ) , we have neglected these correlations .",
    "our results indicate that such correlations are immaterial for the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "we determine the impact of unfolding the sequences in the goe ensemble .",
    "let @xmath60 be a sequence of levels taken from the uniform composite goe ensemble .",
    "we construct an intermediate sequence @xmath61 by folding @xmath60 with the function of eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are as in section  [ 4.1.3 ] .",
    "the intermediate sequence is unfolded with the help of formula  ( [ 26 ] ) ( for 3parameter unfolding ) or ( [ 26a ] ) ( for 2parameter unfolding ) .",
    "this yields an unfolded sequence @xmath64 .",

    "the results are given in tab .",
    "[ tab:3 ] .",
    "we conclude the following :    \\(i ) inferring @xmath5 after 2parameter or 3parameter unfolding produces statistically indistinguishable results .",
    "this confirms the insensitivity of the final ensemble of spacings to the form of the unfolding function , a hypothesis which has always been implicitly made in previous analyses .",
    "it is indeed a condition for the validity of the statistical analysis of spectral fluctuations .",
    "we do not investigate this point further because the insensitivity is known from previous studies .",
    "\\(ii ) in the unfolded goe ensembles , the true value of @xmath5 is correctly inferred ( within the error given by the analysis ) .",
    "it seems that the rigidity of the spectrum of the uniform goe ensemble guarantees that the unfolding procedure only weakly alters the fluctuation properties of the nns . in the next subsection ,",
    "we offer an explanation for this somewhat surprising fact .      in our analysis",
    ", we have separated the unfolding procedure ( which was done first ) from the procedure of inferring @xmath5 . however , unfolding a sequence of levels amounts to inferring the parameters @xmath65 of eqs .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 26a ] ) by way of a fit .",
    "the fit does not determine the value of @xmath65 precisely .",
    "rather , it is itself a procedure of statistical inference and  speaking in terms of bayesian statistics  it produces a distribution of @xmath65 .",
    "we have disregarded this fact .",
    "instead we have used the best  fit ",
    "value of @xmath65 in the subsequent estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "a more satisfactory procedure would be the following : one starts from the distribution @xmath66 of the spacings @xmath67 conditioned by the chaoticity parameter @xmath5 and the parameters @xmath68 for all the sequences contained in the composite ensemble ( surrogate or goe ) .",
    "hence , @xmath69 now is the distribution of the raw data before applying any transformation .",
    "the posterior distribution of @xmath5 is determined after integration over the @xmath65 . in this way one would not consider @xmath65 as given",
    "; rather one would infer @xmath5 after projecting the distribution of all unknown parameters unto the subspace of the interesting one .",
    "in fact , the integration over the uninteresting parameters is somewhat more complicated because it touches the question of a possible `` marginalisation paradox '' .",
    "details are discussed in chap .",
    "12 of @xcite .    at any rate ,",
    "one expects that @xmath5 is determined with smaller error when @xmath70 is given than when @xmath70 is integrated over .",
    "for the example of a simple gaussian model this is demonstrated in appendix [ app3 ] .",
    "we have not performed the integration over the uninteresting parameters @xmath70 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "nobody has taken such a course so far .",
    "this is probably because the method would require a considerable effort  especially for a composite ensemble where @xmath70 is high  dimensional .",
    "we conjecture that the integration over @xmath70 would yield error intervals for @xmath5 that would cover the true value in both cases , the case of the surrogate ensemble and the case of the goe ensemble .",
    "this would mean that in the case of the goe ensemble and under the simplifying assumption that @xmath70 is known , we have found reasonable error intervals .",
    "in the case of the surrogate ensemble , our simplification seems to fail and we have obtained incorrect ( i.e. , too small ) error intervals . our hypothesis can be made plausible by comparing two spectra containing the same number of levels .",
    "one of the spectra displays long  range stiffness , the other , local clustering of levels .",
    "the first spectrum allows for a clearer separation between fluctuations and secular variations than the second one because local clustering may be confused with a secular variation . the fitting procedure would react to this difference and in the first case ascribe a smaller error to @xmath70 than in the second case",
    "in the present paper we have tested the reliability of a statistical analysis of spectral information contained in many short sequences of levels . we have used three uniform surrogate ensembles with known chaoticity parameter @xmath71 containing 50 , 100 and 200 spacings , respectively .",
    "the surrogate ensembles are due to a random  number generator , with spacings that are free of the rigidity of chaotic quantum spectra .",
    "the goe ensembles were constructed from one long experimental spectrum with chaotic quantum behaviour , unit mean level spacing , and known chaoticity parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the spectrum was cut into short sequences .",
    "the sequences were made statistically independent by disregarding a sufficient number of levels between them .",
    "we constructed three uniform composite goe ensembles with 50 , 100 , and 200 spacings , respectively .",
    "( we believe that these ensembles simulate usual experimental cases ) . in both cases ( the surrogate ensembles and the goe ensembles ) , the method of bayesian inference reproduces the true value @xmath59 within the relevant error .",
    "we have investigated the reliability of the unfolding procedure for composite ensembles of levels consisting of many short sequences .",
    "this was done by folding sequences of levels constructed from both , the uniform ensembles and the goe ensembles , with a monotonically increasing function of energy .",
    "the resulting sequences were then unfolded with the help of a different unfolding function .",
    "the nns distributions obtained in this way were combined to form unfolded ensembles .",
    "the resulting chaoticity parameters were determined and compared to the known true value @xmath59 .",
    "the chaoticity parameter @xmath5 inferred from the unfolded surrogate ensembles is too large by about 15% for the ensembles containing 50 and 100 spacings , and by about 7% for the one containing 200 spacings .",
    "these discrepancies are statistically significant .",
    "we have shown that the overestimate is due to the occurrence of many sequences containing a small number of levels each and would be alleviated if a few long sequences were available instead .",
    "generically , however , unfolded surrogate ensembles provide a bias towards full chaoticity .",
    "this is not the case for the goe ensembles where the true value @xmath59 is correctly inferred within the statistical error .    in section  [ expl ] , we have suggested an explanation for the fact that unfolded sequences of levels without long  range rigidity significantly overestimate the chaoticity parameter @xmath5 while unfolded sequences of levels that do obey the long  range order of goe spectra yield correct estimates of @xmath5 .    to obtain the present results ,",
    "we have used the one  parameter conditional distribution of section  [ prop ] in order to interpolate between regular and chaotic systems .",
    "other models of the nns distribution  which we could have used as well  are expected to lead to similar conclusions because ( i ) the bayesian method is by definition free from binning the observable and ( ii ) the explanation in section  [ expl ] is independent of the specific conditional distribution of section  [ prop ] .",
