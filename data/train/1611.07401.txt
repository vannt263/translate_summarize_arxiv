    "why do you read this proceeding of the meeting of a national astronomical society ? probably because of the same reason as for me to write it : because we love music .",
    "do you remember when did your interest in space sciences start ? and in music ?",
    "the first author ( jac ) is an astronomer because he watched _",
    "stars wars _ and _ the empire strikes back _ when he was four years old , and since then he has always wanted to `` explore '' other worlds , in  situ or , more realistically , from the ground with state - of - the - art instruments and telescopes of all sizes .",
    "his interest in music came later , when he was already a teenager .",
    "the first compact disc that he ever bought was _ the songs of distant earth _ ( 1994 ) , but he had already all the mike oldfield s discography in cassette .",
    "the lyrics of one of the oldfield s songs , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvzg9sio704[``saved by a bell '' ] in his album _ discovery _ ( 1984 ) , read like this : +    _ would you like to look through my telescope ? + the milky way s a fine sight to see .",
    "+ all around our universe , we try so hard to view + what s new .",
    "_    make a trip down to sagittarius + and take a spin by some nebula .",

    "we re hoping to meet a shooting star .",
    "+ i can see there s going to be a message from afar .",
    "+ how close we are .",
    "+    at one point , jac was suggested to listen to _ dilogos tres _ , a daily programme on world music , ambient and new age in radio  3 ( the spanish analogue to bbc radio  1 , 2 and 3 , but with no classical music ) . after being hooked on it",
    ", he  started listening the following programme in the radio dayparting , _ el ambig _ , and later the following one , and when he  started the grade of physics he  did not know how to study without listening music of any style ( radio  3 , radio  clsica or his own cassettes and cds ) .",
    "his passion for music was so intense that every chapter of his phd thesis @xcite started with a piece of lyrics , such as claude bertout had done it for his review on t  tauri stars with the leonard cohen s poem `` another night with telescope '' @xcite : + _ i know the stars + are wild as dust + and wait for no man s discipline + but as they wheel + from sky to sky they rake + our lives with pins of light . + _    in the meantime , enrique morente , antonio arias ( aa ) and a few great musicians in spain challenged the flamenco with a breaking album , https://play.spotify.com/album/3d9njfydhcxchmliuah63l[_omega_ ] ( 1996 ) , which has been played in concerts all over the world ( new york , ciudad de mxico , buenos aires , paris , marseille , cannes , bastia , antwerp and the whole spain ) . afterwards , enrique morente went on mixing the most traditional flamenco roots with other influences , while aa , as the leader of the rock band lagartija nick , started exploring new concepts , sometimes with astronomical inspiration and even lyrics .",
    "for example , in the homonymic album _",
    "lagartija nick _",
    "( 1999 ) , he composed songs on pulsars , ether , spheres traveling in space , a moon base , selenography , the experience of astronauts in space , hal  9000 and even light pollution ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xendubjbrm8[``azora  67 '' ] ) : + _ demasiada luz , demasiada luz too much light , too much light + la luz ensucia el cielo light messes the sky + mi cielo est vaco con demasiada luz my sky is empty with too much light + la luz oculta estrellas light hides stars + mi cielo est vaco con demasiada luz my sky is empty with too much light + _    in 2007 , jac published an outreach paper in astronoma , the spanish counterpart of sky & telescope or sterne und weltraum , on examples of musical astronomy and astronomical music @xcite . just afterwards , the paths of jac , a professional astrophysicist expert in stars , brown dwarfs , planets and instrumentation , and aa , a professional musician , composer , vocalist , bassist and guitarist , merged into a single astro - musical project , dubbed @xmath0united*sounds*of*cosmos * @xcite .",
    "we are far from being pioneers in the use of music for education and outreach of astronomy . for example , carl sagan et  al .",
    "@xcite or andrew fraknoi @xcite already set up other comprehensive lists of astro - musical examples when some of the authors of this contribution had not been born yet .",
