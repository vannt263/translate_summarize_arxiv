    "most quantitative trading nowadays is done on short horizons , ranging from a day ( or a few days ) down to micro- and even nanoseconds .",
    "most commercially available multi - factor risk models , majority of whose users are institutions with long holding horizons such as mutual funds and pension funds , contain longer horizon risk factors unsuitable for quantitative trading strategies ( kakushadze and liew , 2015 ) .",
    "factor models with fewer factors such as size ( smb ) , value ( hml ) and momentum ( wml ) , including the 3-factor model by fama and french ( 1993 ) , are also geared toward explaining longer horizon returns .    in this note , to fill the apparent vacuum in the literature , we propose a 4-factor model for overnight returns . for such short horizons",
    "longer horizon factors such as value and growth are not relevant ( kakushadze and liew , 2015 ) .",
    "the question then is , what is relevant and how to construct such factors ?",
    "the fundamental principle we anchor on is what we refer to as  horizon decoupling principle \" . in a nutshell ,",
    "what happens at time horizon @xmath4 is not affected by what happens at time horizon @xmath5 , if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are vastly different . in terms of returns , this decoupling can be restated as the returns for long - term horizons @xmath4 being essentially uncorrelated with the returns for short - term horizons @xmath5 .",
    "the horizon decoupling principle greatly simplifies searching for relevant risk factors for overnight returns .",
    "we can immediately discard any factors based on longer horizon quantities such as value and growth ( ( basu , 1977 ) , ( fama and french , 1992 , 1993 ) , ( lakonishok _ et al _ , 1994 ) , ( asness and stevens , 1995 ) , ( haugen , 1995 ) , ( liew and vassalou , 2000 ) ) , which change essentially quarterly .",
    "however , even for other factors such as size ( banz , 1981 ) , momentum ( ( jegadeesh and titman , 1993 ) , ( asness , 1995 ) ) , liquidity ( ( scholes and williams , 1977 ) , ( asness , _ et al _ , 2001 ) , ( pastor and stambaugh , 2003 ) , anson ( 2013/14 ) ) and volatility ( ang _ et al _ , 2006 ) , care is needed in defining them .",
    "let us take , _",
    "e.g. _ , size .",
    "normally , it is defined as a logarithm of market cap .",
    "however , market cap is a product of price and shares outstanding . while price changes daily , shares outstanding on average change much less frequently and have little predictive power for overnight returns .",
    "this forces the size factor for overnight returns to be defined via a logarithm of _",
    "price_. we discuss this and other points in relation to other risk factors in more detail below .",
    "what we end up with is a 4-factor model .",
    "all 4 factors are constructed based on intraday price and volume data and are analogous to size ( price ) , volatility , momentum and liquidity ( volume ) .",
    "historical regressions _ a la _ fama and macbeth ( 1973 ) suggest that our 4 factors have sizable serial t - statistic and appear to be relevant predictors for overnight returns .",
    "the remainder of this note is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss relevant ( to overnight returns ) risk factors and give their explicit definitions .",
    "section 3 contains concluding remarks .",
    "tables contain results of our historical regressions , which we discuss in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "some legalese is included at the end of section [ sec3 ] .",
    "since , according to the horizon decoupling principle , we should not use any long horizon factors , barring any betas ( see below ) , we are left with 4 candidate factors : size , momentum , liquidity and volatility .",
    "let us discuss them one - by - one .",
    "some notations first .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 is the stock price for the stock labeled by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of stocks in our universe .",
    "in actuality , the price for each stock is a time - series : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where the index @xmath12 labels trading dates , with @xmath13 corresponding to the most recent date in the time series .",
    "if no confusion arises , we will sometimes omit the index @xmath12 .",
    "we will use superscript @xmath14 ( unadjusted open price ) , @xmath15 ( unadjusted intraday high price ) , @xmath16 ( unadjusted intraday low price ) , @xmath17 ( unadjusted close price ) , @xmath18 ( open price fully adjusted for splits and dividends ) , and @xmath19 ( close price fully adjusted for splits and dividends ) , so , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath20 is the unadjusted close price .",
    "@xmath21 is the unadjusted daily volume ( in shares , not dollars ) .",
    "also , we define the overnight return as the close - to - next - open return : @xmath22 note that both prices in this definition are fully adjusted .",
    "we wish to construct a factor model of the form @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the number of risk factors , @xmath25 are the @xmath24 factor returns , @xmath26 are the residuals , and @xmath27 are the factor betas .",
    "note that we do not have an intercept in ( [ reg ] ) because we include the intercept in @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ , for a given date @xmath12 , the @xmath28 matrix @xmath27 contains a column equal the unit @xmath9-vector .",
    "this will be the first column in @xmath27 .",
    "we will denote each such column by @xmath29 ( without the index @xmath30 ) , where \\{name } stands for the name by which we refer to the corresponding factor :  int \" for the intercept ,  prc \" for price ( analog of size ) ,  mom \" for momentum ,  hlv \" for intraday high and low based volatility , and  vol \" for volume ( analog of liquidity ) . here",
    "we wish to construct all factors without using any long horizon fundamental data or intraday tick data , only daily open , high , low , ( adjusted ) close and volume .",
    "the intercept plays the role of  market beta \" : @xmath31 any other non - unit beta typically is too noisy , especially for such short horizons . to remove the noise , one would have to compute correlations of individual stock returns with the market return based on time series looking back many days , which would defy the purpose here as we wish to construct short horizon factors .",
    "neutrality w.r.t .",
    "@xmath32 is simply dollar neutrality , which is approximate market neutrality .",
    "size is essentially a logarithm of market cap ( before any cross - sectional normalization  see below ) .",
    "however , market cap @xmath33 is a product of price @xmath6 and shares outstanding @xmath34 . while price changes daily , shares outstanding @xmath34 on average change much less frequently and have little predictive power for overnight returns . and @xmath35 as risk factors , and confirmed that shares outstanding do not add value . ] since @xmath36 , and since @xmath35 does not add value , we focus on @xmath37 . to be precise , as the analog of the size factor beta for overnight returns , we will take @xmath38 _",
    "i.e. _ , on date @xmath12 we use the previous day s adjusted close .",
    "more precisely , in historical regressions we will use two versions of this factor beta , one defined by ( [ size ] ) , and another one via @xmath39 _ i.e. _ , on date @xmath12 we use the previous day s unadjusted close .",
    "it is more natural to use ( [ size ] ) and this is what should be used in any practical application assuming the splits and dividends are known on the ex - date before the computation is performed .",
    "however , to preemptively pacify any concerns that the regressions we discuss below somehow  look \" into the future by using adjusted previous close , we use both versions .",
    "not surprisingly , ( [ size ] ) works better .",
    "however , ( [ size1 ] ) also works well .",
    "the truth lies in between , closer to the results corresponding to ( [ size ] ) . )",
    "are 100% out - of - sample . however , in practice data providers sometimes can miss dividends for some stocks and fix the adjusted close retroactively , so in this sense the results based on ( [ size ] ) may not be 100% out - of - sample . while ( [ size1 ] ) is an overkill , it is 100% out - of - sample as it relates to adjustments as none are applied . ]",
    "there are various ways of defining the momentum factor beta . _",
    "e.g. _ , one can take a @xmath40-day moving average of close - to - close returns , _ etc .",
    "_ generally , the returns from the dates further and further into the past have lower and lower correlations with our overnight returns . here",
    "we define the momentum beta as follows : @xmath41 _ i.e. _ , this is simply the previous day s open - to - close return .",
    "there are various ways of defining the intraday volatility .",
    "a simple definition is given by ( before any cross - sectional normalization ",
    "see below ) @xmath42 averaging over the last @xmath40 days is necessary to smooth out the noise .",
    "unlike the  market beta \" , however , because we are dealing with a variance - like quantity here ( as opposed to a correlation - like quantity ) , looking back @xmath40 days is fine here as the high - low intraday swings are much more stable compared with correlation - based betas , which vary dramatically day - to - day with little out - of - sample stability . for our model",
    "we use @xmath43 ( these are trading days , so this corresponds to 1 month ) .",
    "also , note that ( [ hlv ] ) actually is logarithmic intraday volatility .",
    "taking the intraday volatility itself as a factor beta would have the effect of interfering with the intercept beta ( and the resulting t - statistic are worse ) .",
    "let us mention alternative definitions of @xmath44 : @xmath45 such variations are all fine and have minor pros and cons but do not make it or break it ( see below ) . )",
    "should not be referred to as  hlv \" , but we will use this name anyway . ]",
    "we find that the definition ( [ hlv ] ) works rather well .",
    "typically , liquidity is defined ( before any cross - sectional normalization ",
    "see below ) as a log of the average daily dollar volume ( addv ) , which we denote via @xmath46 : @xmath47 while the price can change substantially over multiple days @xmath40 , it is the volume @xmath48 that causes the most change in this expression .",
    "let us approximate it as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath40-day moving average volume .",
    "note that @xmath51 .",
    "however , since we already have the log - of - price based factor beta ( _ i.e. _ , prc ) , , then vol should also use @xmath52 and adjusted volume  see below . ]",
    "it is the @xmath53 piece that could make a difference here .",
    "therefore , we define the volume (  liquidity \" ) factor beta as follows ( before any cross - sectional normalization  see below ) @xmath54 again , averaging over @xmath40 days is necessary here to smooth out the noise .",
    "note that @xmath55 in ( [ avg.vol ] ) is unadjusted , so it jumps during splits .",
    "this can be taken care of by adjusting the volume : @xmath56 this takes care of the splits , and also inadvertently  adjusts \" the volume for dividends .",
    "however , such  adjustments \" are small and do not affect much .",
    "the  in - sample \" issue mentioned above as it relates to using adjusted prices is very minor here as it is lost in all the noise in the volume . in regressions below we use @xmath43 .",
    "the factor betas that are expected to have normal distributions , namely , hlv ( [ hlv ] ) ( also , ( [ hlv1 ] ) and ( [ hlv2 ] ) ) and vol ( [ vol ] ) ( also , ( [ vol1 ] ) ) , are then normalized by conforming them to a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the unnormalized factor beta , as it is done in ( kakushadze and liew , 2015 ) .",
    "factor betas mom ( [ mom ] ) and prc ( [ size ] ) ( also , ( [ size1 ] ) ) are not normalized .",
    "before we can run our regressions , we need to select our universe . here",
    "we are building a factor model for short horizon ( overnight ) returns .",
    "it is clear that such a factor model is not expected to work for stocks that do not trade or trade just a little for days on at a time , _",
    "i.e. _ , our factor model , by its very nature , is expected to work for actively traded , liquid stocks .",
    "we wish to keep our discussion here as simple as possible , so we select our universe based on addv @xmath46 ( with @xmath43  see ( [ addv ] ) ) by taking top 2000 tickers .",
    "however , to ensure that we do not inadvertently introduce a universe selection bias , we do not rebalance the universe daily .",
    "instead , we rebalance monthly , every 21 trading days , to be precise . _",
    "i.e. _ , we break our 5-year backtest period ( see below ) into 21-day intervals , we compute the universe using addv ( which , in turn , is computed based on the 21-day period immediately preceding such interval ) , and use this universe during the entire such interval .",
    "the bias that we do have , however , is the survivorship bias . we take the data for the universe of tickers as of 9/6/2014 that have historical pricing data on http://finance.yahoo.com ( accessed on 9/6/2014 ) for the period 8/1/2008 through 9/5/2014 .",
    "we restrict this universe to include only u.s .",
    "listed common stocks and class shares ( no otcs , preferred shares , _ etc .",
    "_ ) as of 9/6/2014 .",
    "however , it does not appear that the survivorship bias should be a significant effect .",
    "we are not looking at simulated p&l , in ( [ reg ] ) ( _ i.e. _ , do mean - reversion  see ( kakushadze , 2015a ) for details ) , which are directly affected by the survivorship bias .",
    "] but at the serial t - statistic of the factor returns @xmath25 ( see below ) , which are affected by the survivorship bias only indirectly ( as @xmath25 do not carry the stock index @xmath8 ) , and on general grounds such second order effects are expected to be lost in all the noise , especially that our regressions are daily , while our addv - based universe rebalancing is monthly .",
    "let us also mention that the addv - based universe selection is by no means optimal and is chosen here for the sake of simplicity . in practical applications ,",
    "the factor model should be computed based on the actual trading universe of liquid stocks , which typically is carefully selected based on market cap , liquidity ( addv ) , price and other criteria . for such",
    ", more optimal universes , the results of the regressions are expected to be even better",
    ". however , the addv - based universe selection suffices for our purposes here .",
    "next , we run the cross - sectional regressions ( [ reg ] ) for each date over the period of 5 years . ,",
    "and @xmath13 is 9/5/2014 ( see the beginning of this section ) .",
    "] this gives the residuals @xmath26 and factor returns @xmath25 .",
    "we are after the factor return serial t - statistic _ a la _ fama and macbeth ( 1973 ) .",
    "these are given in table [ table1 ] for the top-2000-by - addv universe ( see previous subsection ) for the 4 factors prc , mom , hlv and vol together with int . in table [ table1 ]",
    "we give the annualized t - statistic for the prc factor defined both using adjusted ( [ size ] ) and unadjusted ( [ size1 ] ) close .",
    "next , we combine int , prc , mom , hlv and vol and run the regressions on these 5-column factor betas . the results are given in table [ table2 ] for the top-2000-by - addv universe .",
    "these results show sizable t - statistic for the 4 factors prc , mom , hlv and vol .",
    "we then expand the universe to top-3000-by - addv and top-4000-by - addv in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the overall median f - statistic drops when we go to top-4000-by - addv .",
    "the dramatic increase in the t - statistic for mom is due to the fact that open - to - close mean - reversion based on overnight returns on paper appears to  work \" exceptionally well for the lower liquidity stocks with addv between top-3000 and top-4000 . for these stocks mom has very high t - statistic , and it is also higher for vol , , @xmath57 and 8.19 for int , mom and vol , respectively .",
    "] so these two factors overwhelm prc and hlv in the 4-factor model , albeit the latter have sizable t - statistic on their own ( _ i.e. _ , when individually combined with int ) .      as an additional check ,",
    "we ran the regressions ( [ reg ] ) on a 14-factor model comprised of 10 bics sectors-[table3 ] have bics sector data . those tickers without bics",
    "sector data have been excluded from the regressions reported in table [ table4 ] , where the top-2000-by - addv universe therefore is based on this somewhat smaller subset of tickers.[foot.bics ] ] as factors plus prc , mom , hlv and vol .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table4 ] and further indicate that prc , mom , hlv and vol are statistically relevant predictors for overnight returns .",
    "notice how adding these 4 factors significantly improves sector factor t - statistic ( columns 1 and 2 _ vs. _ 3 in table [ table4 ] ) .",
    "also , note that the intercept is not added separately as it is already subsumed in the sector betas .",
    "if the stock labeled by @xmath8 belongs to the sector labeled by @xmath58 ; otherwise , @xmath59 .",
    "each stock belongs to one and only one sector .",
    "this implies that @xmath60 for each @xmath8 , so a linear combination of sector betas is the intercept.[foot.sec ] ]      as one final check that our 4 factors are relevant predictors for overnight returns , we ran a simulation for an intraday mean - reversion alpha in four different incarnations .",
