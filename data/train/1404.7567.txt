    "a system of coupled oscillators provides abundant examples of dynamical behaviors including synchronization phenomena @xcite . among them , collective synchronization emerging from coupled phase oscillators has been widely investigated not only for globally coupled systems but also for complex network systems @xcite .",

    "the appearance of the ott - antonsen ansatz  @xcite has considerably facilitated theoretical investigations on interacting groups of noiseless nonidentical phase oscillators with global sinusoidal coupling .",
    "in addition , interacting groups of globally coupled phase oscillators as well as a system of globally coupled phase oscillators have been experimentally realized using electrochemical oscillators  @xcite , discrete chemical oscillators  @xcite , and mechanical oscillators  @xcite .",
    "to study the phase synchronization between macroscopic rhythms , we recently formulated a theory for the collective phase description of macroscopic rhythms emerging from coupled phase oscillators for the following three representative cases : ( a ) phase coherent states in globally coupled noisy identical oscillators  @xcite , ( b ) partially phase - locked states in globally coupled noiseless nonidentical oscillators  @xcite , and ( c ) fully phase - locked states in networks of coupled noiseless nonidentical oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the theory enables us to describe the dynamics of a macroscopic rhythm by a single degree of freedom called the collective phase . accordingly , different mathematical treatments were required for the physical situation in each case .",
    "the keystone of the collective phase description method for each case is the following : ( a ) the nonlinear fokker - planck equation  @xcite , ( b ) the ott - antonsen ansatz  @xcite , and ( c ) the laplacian matrix  @xcite . here",
