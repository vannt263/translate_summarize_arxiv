    "the interacting one - dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) has intrigued physicists since the pioneering work of tomonaga@xcite . through the collective effort of many of them , and especially due to the advancement of the bosonization technique@xcite , a large number of its properties have been discovered .",
    "the past two decades have witnessed an experimental effort to identify and study , using various probes , quasi - one - dimensional systems . among the materials",
    "studied one finds organic compounds such as polyacetylene@xcite and the bechgaard salts@xcite as well as several families of inorganic quasi - one - dimensional materials@xcite ( for example , the transition metal bronzes ) .",
    "the edge states in the quantum hall effect constitute yet another realization of one - dimensional interacting systems@xcite .",
    "progress made in nanoscale fabrication techniques have made it possible to artificially define one - dimensional channels in two - dimensional electronic heterostructures@xcite .",
    "most recently , experimental evidence has emerged for the existence of stripe phases in doped antiferromagnets , such as the copper - oxide high temperature superconductors@xcite . in these phases the doped holes segregate into quasi - one - dimensional metallic regions embedded in a predominantly antifferomagnetic background .    in recent years angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has matured into a powerful experimental method for probing the single particle properties of strongly correlated systems .",
    "arpes measurements on the bechgaard salts@xcite , the transition metalchalcogenides @xcite , the blue bronzes@xcite and the cuprates@xcite have provided evidence in favor of correlated one - dimensional physics although full agreement with the predicted theoretical picture is still lacking .",
    "the zero temperature correlation functions of the gapless tomonaga - luttinger liquid , and in particular the single hole spectral function which is measured by arpes , have been calculated previously for the spinless@xcite as well as for the spinfull case@xcite .",
    "extending these results to finite temperatures is desirable on the following grounds .",
    "first , real experiments are carried out at finite temperatures and should be contrasted with theoretical predictions relevant for such conditions .",
    "secondly , the tomonaga - luttinger liquid is a quantum critical system which consequently exhibits scaling behavior .",
    "it is a rare example where not only the scaling exponents but indeed the entire scaling functions can be computed explicitly . in section",
    "ii we obtain the scaling form of the single hole spectral function and the spin dynamic structure factor of the spinfull tomonaga - luttinger liquid . closed form analytical expressions are derived for a number of special cases .",
    "these results complement previous numerical evaluations of the finite temperature spectral functions @xcite and allow for easy investigation of their properties in few limits which are of physical interest .",
    "integrals of these spectral functions are considered as well .",
    "when backward scattering of electrons becomes relevant the 1deg develops a spin gap and is described by the luther - emery liquid@xcite ( umklapp processes may create a charge gap ) . while the spectrum of the luther - emery liquid can be readily derived at the special `` free fermion '' point @xmath0 , the evaluation of electronic correlation functions there is non - trivial due to their highly non - local form in terms of the pseudo- fermions .",
    "several authors have made progress in this direction , see refs .",
    "[ voitref],[wiegmannref ] , and in section iii we extend and correct their study and obtain exact expressions for the single hole spectral function at the free fermion point for temperatures much smaller than the spin gap .",
    "some technical details are relegated to appendices .",
    "the tomonaga  luttinger model embodies the low energy and long wavelength physics of the 1deg .",
    "it is composed of two branches of left @xmath1 and right @xmath2 moving massless dirac fermions constructed around the left and right fermi points of the 1deg .",
    "we will consider the case where the fermions carry spin @xmath3 and denote by @xmath4 their spin polarization . in the absence of backward scattering and umklapp",
    "processes the hamiltonian density is given by @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the noninteracting fermi velocity and @xmath8 with being the pauli matrices . despite its appearance , the last term in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) does not break the @xmath9 spin symmetry , since @xmath10 ; the @xmath11 term is the only term which breaks this symmetry .    in order to compute the single particle properties of the model one uses the bosonization identity@xcite @xmath12 \\ ; , \\ ] ] which expresses the fermionic fields in terms of self - dual fields @xmath13 obeying @xmath14=-i\\pi\\delta_{\\eta,\\eta'}\\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}{\\rm sign}(x - x')$ ] .",
    "the klein factors @xmath15 are responsible for reproducing the correct anti - commutation relations between different fermionic species and @xmath16 is a short distance cutoff that is taken to zero at the end of the calculation . here and throughout the paper we consider the limit where the size of the system @xmath17 is taken to infinity and correspondingly ignore terms of the order @xmath18 ( for a discussion of finite size effects in the finite temperature case see refs .",
    "[ mattsson97ref]-[eggert97ref ] ) .",

    "we note , however , that spin - rotation invariance dictates @xmath28 and consequently @xmath29 .      the bosonized expression for the fermion field operators ( [ bidentity ] ) and the fact that the theory reduces to that of free bosons make it straightforward to derive expressions for the space - time response functions ( which we denote with a tilde ) .",
    "we will focus on the finite temperature single hole green function @xmath30 we compute this green function , rather than the more usual time ordered or retarded green functions , because it includes only the one - hole states .",
    "this fact makes it relevant to arpes whose cross section is directly proportional to the fourier transform of @xmath31 .",
    "other green functions can be easily obtained from it , since for the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) @xmath32 .",
    "we will also consider the @xmath33 component of the transverse spin dynamic structure factor , which is measured by polarized neutron scattering @xmath34 where @xmath35 and the @xmath36 are the pauli matrices .    the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is a quantum critical system .",
    "it also exhibits spin - charge separation .",
    "this implies a scaling form for the response functions with separate spin and charge pieces .",
    "specifically one finds@xcite @xmath37 where we introduced the thermal lengths ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 and the exponents @xmath40 defined so that @xmath41 for noninteracting fermions . since the spin and charge sectors are formally invariant under separate lorentz transformations the functions @xmath42 also spilt into right and left moving parts @xmath43 where @xmath44^{-\\gamma } \\ ; .\\ ] ] similarly , for the spin correlation function one finds@xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 here we introduced the exponents @xmath47    we note that the perpendicular component of the spin dynamic structure factor @xmath48 is obtained from the result for the transverse part ( [ scalesr ] ) after multiplying it by an overall factor of @xmath3 and using the exponents @xmath49 instead of ( [ betadef ] ) .",
    "this holds true also for the spectral functions calculated in the following subsections . of coarse , in the spin rotation invariant",
    "case @xmath50 .",
    "it is a general feature of the field - theoretic approach to this problem that relatively simple expressions are obtained for the space - time dependent correlation functions . for comparison with experiments , however , we are typically interested in the fourier transform of these correlation functions . conceptually , this is simple , and indeed , to evaluate the fourier transform , we need only to perform a two dimensional integral .",
    "however , it is not generally simple to carry out this calculation analytically .",
    "below we consider the cases where this can be done .    as we noted before , the critical nature of the model leads to a scaling form for the spectral functions .",
    "a simplifying feature introduced by the spin - charge separation is the ability to express these scaling functions as a convolution of spin and charge parts @xmath51}\\tilde g^<_{\\eta}(x , t;t ) \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\frac{a}{(2\\pi)^3 v_c}\\left(\\frac{a}{\\lambda_{t , c}}\\right)^{2\\gamma_c- \\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\frac{a}{\\lambda_{t , s}}\\right)^{2\\gamma_s-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\\\ \\nonumber & \\times&\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } dq\\ , d\\nu\\ , g_c(q,\\nu)\\,g_s ( \\tilde k - rq,\\tilde\\omega-\\nu ) \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the velocity ratio @xmath52 , define the scaling variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 , the fourier transform of @xmath56 , is evaluated in appendix a , where some of its properties are listed as well .",

    "we also define the fourier transform with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "this has the effect of making @xmath62 positive outside the fermi surface and negative inside ; thus giving the same expression for the spectral function of left and right moving holes .",
    "here we would like to note the non - commutativity of the limits @xmath67 and @xmath68 in calculating the zero temperature dc response of the system . due to the scaling form of the spectral functions taking the zero temperature limit",
    "first gives a result which is determined by the @xmath69 behavior of the scaling functions , while it is the @xmath70 behavior which is relevant in case @xmath62 or @xmath71 is set to zero from the outset .",
    "further analytic progress in calculating the spectral functions can be achieved in the following cases :      since there is no symmetry between the charge and spin sectors , we generally expect that the spin and charge velocities are different .",
    "this greatly complicates the explicit calculation of the fourier transforms , as the model is not `` lorentz invariant '' under transformations that involve both the spin and charge sectors .",
    "such an invariance is restored if @xmath73 . in this case",
    "the correlation functions have the same form as those of a related model of spinless electrons , for which the zero temperature spectral functions have been calculated by luther and peschel @xcite .",
    "the major simplification that follows directly from the fact that the charge and spin velocities are equal is that the two - dimensional fourier transform reduces to a product of two one - dimensional transforms - one for the right moving piece and one for the left moving piece .",

    "there is no mixing between left and right moving spin excitations . as a result",

    "there are severe kinematic constraints on @xmath64 that make it non - vanishing , in the zero temperature limit , only in a wedge in @xmath85 plane defined by the lines @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 . while @xmath29 reflects a symmetry of the problem it is unlikely that @xmath82 ( @xmath89 ) is realized in any interacting system .",
    "however , if the effective interactions are not too strong then @xmath90 may be small .",
    "for instance , for the hubbard model@xcite , even in the @xmath91 limit , @xmath92 .",
    "for such systems we expect ( [ gk00 ] ) to be qualitatively correct with the exception of the behavior of @xmath64 outside the above mentioned wedge .",
    "in contrast to the result for @xmath89 the @xmath93 support of @xmath64 , for non - zero @xmath90 , extends up to the line @xmath94 with @xmath95 . nevertheless , if the mixing between left and right moving charge excitations ( i.e @xmath90 ) is small the amplitude of @xmath64 outside the wedge is small and its gross features resemble the @xmath89 result .    the customary way to present arpes data",
