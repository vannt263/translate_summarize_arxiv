    "plichko ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) noticed that if @xmath2 is not a hilbert space the maximal argument applied to the dual space gives another auerbach basis , which means that in a finite dimensional banach space there always exist two different auerbach bases ( here we identify bases which differ only by permutation or multiplication by scalars of absolute value one ) .",
    "motivated by this result peczyski stated the conjecture that any @xmath3-dimensional banach space admits at least @xmath3 different auerbach bases . in this paper",

    ". therefore we immediately get a corollary    any @xmath3-dimensional convex body has at last @xmath8 different systems of conjugate affine diameters .    our method of proof consists of the study of critical values of determinant function . in section [ section2 ]",

    "finally in section [ section6 ] we show that the set of norms for which the morse theory applies is open and dense in a suitable topology .",
    "therefore the estimation of the number of auerbach bases given by the second part of theorem [ auerbach ] holds for a generic norm . in section 7",
    "we apply the methods developed in the previous sections to estimate the number of so called auerbach simplices which could be treated as another analog of auerbach bases for non - symmetric bodies .",
