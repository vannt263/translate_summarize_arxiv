    "the shift in the probe spectrum after switching on the pump field can be used to extract the strength of the interaction for given average number of pump polaritons .",
    "it is clear that for larger negative detuning the shift is much smaller than the zero detuning case , as here the polaritons are much more photonic and weakly interact .",

    "significant exception appeared for large negative detuning , as here lower branch polaritons of long wave lengths are much more photonic than excitation and they are weakly interact via the kinematic interactions .",
    "polaritons in this regime can be treated as interacting photons , where the issue of superfluidity of photons is proposed for such a system .",
    "different optical nonlinear processes are treated and presented as a tool for observing physical properties of the system . here",

    "the blue shift in the probe spectrum found to be proportional to the kinematic interaction strength .",
    "furthermore , for identical counter propagating pump fields , we derived the steady state average number of photons for various parameters . in this case",
    "we extracted the atom - atom correlation of two separated atoms in the lattice that indicates possible significant long range interaction mediated by the cavity photons . for finite external pump - polariton detuning we got optical bistability behavior in the average number of polaritons as a function of the external pump intensity .",

    "the polariton is half excitation and half photon . for large negative detuning",
    "the lower branch becomes more photonic and the upper one more excitation , and for large positive detuning the opposite the lower branch becomes more excitation and the upper one more photonic .",

    "things are drastically changed for large negative detuning , as now the lower branch around small wave numbers becomes more photonic and in the off - resonance case the scattering become finite and drops down with increasing the negative detuning .    the polariton for large negative detuning is weakly scattered in the limit of @xmath288 , where the absolute value of the scattering amplitude is @xmath289 in the limit of large negative detuning the parabolic assumption holds and the contribution of the upper branch is negligible . here",
    "the polaritons are weakly scattered from the vacancy .    as the defect potential is relatively a deep square well potential of depth @xmath1 and width @xmath0 ,",
    "the scattering is the same as that from a square barrier potential of height @xmath1 and width @xmath0 .",
    "namely , we have the known result that for deep potentials the appearance of bound states is immaterial as the probability to hit a resonance is very small .",
