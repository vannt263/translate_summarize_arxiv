    "atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are now widely used for studies of many - body physics  @xcite and as bright sources for atom optics and interferometry  @xcite . since the first demonstrations of condensation in magnetic @xcite and optical @xcite traps , the development of experimental setups for bec production has generally taken two parallel routes . on one hand ,",
    "some applications require ever more complex setups ; these , for example , include multi - species experiments  @xcite , single - particle detection  @xcite or hybrid systems combining neutral atoms and ions  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there has also been a continuing effort to design simple and inexpensive machines that are still suitable for many experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a particularly simple apparatus , built exclusively from off - the - shelf components , and our cooling procedure for production of @xmath0 becs . while being compact and consisting of a single vacuum chamber for both laser and evaporative cooling ( see fig .",

    "@xcite , we reliably produce quasi - pure becs of @xmath4 atoms in @xmath2s . using the same setup , we also explored condensation in an optically plugged quadrupole trap  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we study the plugging laser power requirements for a range of plug - laser wavelengths and show that it is possible to achieve condensation using as little as @xmath3mw of plug power .",
    "this opens the possibility of implementing this approach using inexpensive diode lasers .",
    "recently , we have used this apparatus ( in the hybrid - trap configuration ) to demonstrate bose - einstein condensation in a uniform optical - box potential  @xcite .",

    "all coils except 9 and 10 are paired ( only one coil per pair is shown ) . ]",
    "bec production in a single - chamber vacuum system is subject to two contradicting requirements : while a higher @xmath0 vapour pressure facilitates loading of the magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , a lower background gas pressure increases the lifetime and evaporation efficiency during later cooling stages .",
    "condensation is achieved by carefully balancing these two requirements . in our experiments",
    "this balance is improved by using isotopically pure @xmath0 vapour sources ( purchased from alvatec ) .",

    "a quartz cell by triad technology allows optical access via two @xmath5 ( top and bottom ) and eight @xmath6 anti - reflection coated windows .",
    "the vacuum is maintained by a single @xmath7 ion pump .",
    "after moderate baking of the system , at @xmath8 for a week , we achieve magnetic trap lifetimes of over @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0 pressure typically reduces this to about @xmath10 .",
    "the magnetic quadrupole field for both the mot and the magnetic trap is created by an anti - helmholtz pair of 16-turn water - cooled coils wound from 4  mm copper tubing (  7 \" in fig .  [",

    "these create an axial gradient of @xmath11 when carrying @xmath12 .",

    ", we achieve rabi frequencies above @xmath18 using @xmath19 of rf power .      magneto - optical trapping of @xmath0 requires two laser frequencies of its @xmath20 line ( near @xmath21 .",
    "we use two grating - stabilised external - cavity diode lasers ( dl pro from toptica photonics ) .",

    "we use large diameter ( @xmath6 ) beams which do not need to be realigned for months .",
    "the light for optical pumping and absorption imaging of the atoms is derived from the cooling light . the pumping and imaging beams",
    "are controlled by additional aoms and enter the chamber via the  back \" viewport ( 5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacuum ] ) .",
    "the optical - dipole - trap ( odt ) beam used for the hybrid trap is derived from a @xmath26 ytterbium fiber laser ( ylr-20-lp from ipg photonics ) . after passing through an aom ,",
    "the beam is focused by a concave - convex pair of lenses , allowing the adjustment of both waist size and position .",
    "we typically use a beam waist of @xmath27 and a maximum power of @xmath28 at the atoms .",
    "higher powers lead to excessive atom losses , which can be attributed to two - photon transitions  @xcite ; these transitions are caused by the large linewidth of the trapping laser ( @xmath29 in our case ) .",
    "the focal point is positioned approximately a beam waist below the zero of the magnetic quadrupole field .",

    "sapphire laser ( coherent mbr-110 ) in order to explore a range of plug wavelengths and powers .",
    "however , since we show that as little as @xmath33 of plug power is sufficient to achieve quantum degeneracy , in future experiments the plug light could be generated using a simple diode laser .    the plug beam is focused to a waist of @xmath34 and aligned to overlap with the zero of the magnetic quadrupole field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams ] .",
    "we image the atoms with a collimated , circularly polarised beam , resonant with the @xmath35 transition .",
    "the imaging efficiency was calibrated to account for the deviations of the absorption cross - section from the theoretical value , primarily due to imperfections in the polarisation of the imaging light .",

    "@xmath36 was measured by extrapolating the non - saturation slope of the thermal component to the condensation point as described in @xcite .",
    "we found an imaging efficiency of @xmath38 , which lies in the range typical of other experiments @xcite .",

    "typically , we load the mot to @xmath41 atoms in @xmath42 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath43s of loading are sufficient to produce becs with @xmath44 atoms . in daily operation ,",
    "mot atom numbers are deduced from the intensity of fluorescence light collected on a photodiode , which was calibrated using absorption imaging .    following the initial loading stage , we compress the mot by increasing @xmath45 to @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and then detune the cooling light to @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( cmot , @xcite ) .",
    "we found that these steps reduce the temperature and improve transfer into the magnetic trap .",
    "these steps are followed by @xmath50 of optical molasses during which the magnetic field is switched off and the cooling - light detuning of @xmath48 is maintained . this cools the cloud to @xmath51 .",

    "the atoms are then captured in a magnetic potential by suddenly turning on the quadrupole field with @xmath59 ( matching the gradient of the cmot ) and then ramping @xmath45 to @xmath60 over @xmath61 .",

    "we verified the parameters of the model ( such as beam waist ) by measuring trapping frequencies and comparing them with theoretical predictions .",

    "fits to the thermal and condensed components are indicated . ]      during the initial evaporation stage in the compressed trap ( * i * in figs .",
    "[ fig : sequence ] and [ fig : nt ] ) , we ramp the rf frequency linearly from @xmath17 to @xmath71 in @xmath72 .",
    "we achieve a 30-fold increase in the peak phase space density , with an evaporation efficiency @xmath73/{\\rm d}[\\ln{n}]=2.1 $ ] .    at the end of this stage",
    "the cloud typically contains @xmath74 atoms at @xmath75 .      in stage",
    "* ii * the magnetic field gradient is decompressed to just below the gravity - compensating value , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the atom mass , @xmath78 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath79 is the bohr magneton . from this point on ,",
    "the atoms are supported against gravity by optical forces only , while the confinement along the odt axis is dominated by the magnetic forces  @xcite .",
    "note that the odt beam is on from the beginning of the magnetic trapping ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence ] ) , but initially does not have a dominant role .",
    "we decompress @xmath45 to @xmath60 over @xmath80 while keeping the rf frequency constant , then decompress further to @xmath81 while sweeping the rf frequency linearly to @xmath82 in @xmath83 ; this provides a good gain in phase - space density despite the weak magnetic confinement .",
    "finally , the magnetic field is decompressed from @xmath84 to @xmath85 . in this step",
    "we sweep the field gradient according to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and the sweep duration is @xmath88 .",
    "this changes the rf - limited trap depth approximately linearly with time , with the approximation being exact in the case of no odt and @xmath89 .    at the end of this stage",
    "we typically have @xmath90 atoms at @xmath91 .      for @xmath92",
    ", evaporation is no longer driven by the rf field . instead , the trap depth is limited by the potential height at a saddle point vertically below the magnetic - field zero @xcite .",
    "evaporation can thus be forced efficiently by lowering the odt power , @xmath68 , albeit at the cost of a small reduction in the trapping frequencies .",
    "we ramp @xmath68 exponentially to its final value , @xmath93 , with a time constant of @xmath94 and total ramp duration of @xmath95 .",
    "( both parameters have been optimised empirically . )",
    "we achieve an evaporation efficiency of @xmath96 , leading to condensation at @xmath97 .    at the critical point , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . at this point ,",
    "the trapping frequency is about 30  hz along the odt axis and about 90  hz radially .",
    "lowering the odt power further results in quasi - pure condensates of @xmath100 atoms .",
    "the lifetime of the quasi - pure bec is @xmath101 , consistent with the expected 3-body losses @xcite .",
    "our experiments with the optically plugged quadrupole trap were performed before we could introduce the isotopically pure @xmath0 vapour sources into the setup . for this reason",
    "the atom numbers in the hybrid and plugged traps can not be directly compared .",
    "the @xmath102 abundance of @xmath0 in the natural isotopic mixture means that for the same background pressure , hence the same mot loading time and cloud lifetime in the magnetic trap , the mot loading rate is about 4 times smaller .",
    "the collisional rate , which determines the efficiency of evaporative cooling , is then also correspondingly lower . as a result of these effects",
    ", we could produce only smaller becs , containing up to @xmath103 atoms .",
    "our goal here , however , was not to maximise the atom number , but to investigate the minimal requirements on the plug - laser power",
    ". the improvements brought about by using isotopically pure @xmath0 sources should equally increase the degenerate sample size in plugged - trap experiments .    in the first plugged - trap experiment , @xmath43w of 532 nm",
    "laser power was used  @xcite , while later it was shown that by reducing the plug size this requirement can be reduced to @xmath104w  @xcite . here",
    "we show that bringing the laser wavelength closer to the atomic resonance can reduce this value to as little as @xmath3mw .      in these experiments ,",
    "the laser - cooling stage was essentially the same as in sec .",
    "[ sec : mot ] , except that the optimisation of the rubidium pressure for best bec production resulted in @xmath105 atoms being loaded into the mot .",
    "the atoms were then loaded into the plugged quadrupole trap with an axial gradient of @xmath106 .",
    "the strong magnetic confinement compensates for the smaller initial atom number and allows the initiation of evaporative cooling .",
    "rf evaporation started at @xmath107 .",
    "after holding @xmath67 constant for @xmath108 , we swept it linearly to @xmath109 in @xmath72 . at this point",
    "the cloud was sufficiently dense for the losses due to three - body recombination to become relevant  @xcite .",
    "we thus decompressed the trap to @xmath110 in @xmath111 .",
    "the rf frequency was then swept exponentially from @xmath112 to @xmath113 in @xmath114 .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     in the above cooling sequence , the plug laser beam was on from the moment the atoms were loaded into the quadrupole magnetic trap .",
    "however , its efficiency in preventing majorana losses depends on its power and wavelength . reducing the beam detuning from the atomic resonance increases both the optical dipole forces and the spontaneous light scattering , thus allowing smaller powers to be used , but at the cost of more heating and shorter lifetimes .    to study this effect quantitatively , we varied the plug - laser wavelength in the range @xmath115 and the beam power , @xmath116 , in the range @xmath117mw - @xmath118 , while keeping the beam geometry fixed .",

    "nm we achieve condensation for @xmath120mw ; increasing @xmath116 beyond 300  mw leads to only a slow increase in the atom number . at @xmath121 nm , as little as 70  mw of plug power is sufficient for condensation .",
    "note , however , that in this case one should use the minimum necessary laser power , since increasing @xmath116 further actually has adverse effects due to the increased spontaneous light scattering .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : plug](b ) we plot the number of atoms at the end of the evaporation versus the peak value of the repulsive potential created by the plug beam .",
    "we see that the threshold potential is in fact the same for a range of wavelengths .",
    "this also shows that ( for this range of wavelengths ) the spontaneous light scattering is not relevant for powers up to the threshold value . only for higher peak potentials we see that longer wavelengths ( closer to resonance ) lead to lower atom numbers due to the spontaneous scattering .",
