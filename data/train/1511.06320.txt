    "risk - based solvency frameworks ( such as solvency  ii or the swiss solvency test  ( sst ) ) assess the financial health of insurance companies by quantifying the capital adequacy through calculating the solvency capital requirement . roughly speaking",
    ", companies can use their own economic capital models ( internal models ) for calculating the available capital amounts ( net assets ) after one year provided the internal model is approved by the insurance supervisor . the random variable given by the capital amount after one year",
    "is required to be acceptable with respect to a prescribed risk measure .",
    "since key market players are organized in groups , the question of setting appropriate solvency requirements for groups becomes highly relevant , and the quantification of risks for a group of different legal entities ( agents ) is an essential aim of regulators .",
    "the main feature of the group setting is the possibility of intragroup transfers ( igt ) that may alter financial positions of individual agents .",
    "section  [ sec : sol - groups ] surveys fundamental ideas in this relation that have been already mentioned in  @xcite and are intensively discussed in the financial industry .",
    "a key question is to what extent igts should be taken into account for the purpose of risk assessment .",
    "the choice and admissibility of igts may influence the risk assessment .",
    "these admissible transfer instruments range from the free movement of capital between the agents ( unconstrained approach ) to the case when no transfers are allowed at all ( strictly granular risk assessment ) . in between",
    ", we consider allowing transactions that prohibit transfers that render the giver bankrupt or those originating from a bankrupt agent .",
    "one might consider imposing some safety margins or taking into account fungibility issues , see section  [ sec : restr - transf ] .",
    "our aim is to provide a unified framework in order to explicitly describe such transfers and the relevant risk measures .",
    "so far the idea of using random closed sets ( most importantly random cones ) to describe multiasset portfolios is well established , see @xcite .",
    "we show that a similar approach may be used to describe the sets of admissible igts .",
    "the key idea of our approach is to regard the group as acceptable if there exists an admissible transfer that renders acceptable the individual positions of all agents . the family of vectors representing the capital amounts added to ( or released from ) each agent that make the group acceptable serves as a risk measure for the group",
    "this idea is similar to the risk assessment of multiasset portfolios from @xcite and @xcite , while the main difference is the non - conical dependence of the set of admissible transfer instruments from the current capital position . as a result",
    "we end up with the new possibility to explicitly translate realistic ( non - conical ) transfer constraints in a quantitative risk management framework that assesses genuine intragroup diversification benefits .",
    "section  [ sec : set - valu - portf ] recalls major concepts related to random closed sets , their selections , thereby following and extending some results from @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : admissible - crti ] introduces the random sets of admissible igts .",
    "furthermore , it formulates and analyses the relevant capital requirements in terms of set - valued risk assessment of the relevant random sets of admissible positions . since the family of admissible igts typically depends to a large extent on the level of distress a group",
    "is faced with , this dependence creates non - conical and non - linear effects .",
    "section  [ sec : gran - cons - tests ] recasts the classical granular and consolidated approaches into our setting .",
    "we show that , under some canonical assumptions , the granular approach can be obtained by restricting the set of igts in the _ unconstrained solvency test _ ,",
    "i.e.  in the test without any constraints on igts . in the coherent case",
    ", the latter corresponds to the consolidated solvency approach , which is frequently used in practice .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the unconstrained solvency test in important non - coherent cases .",
    "various restrictions of transfers are discussed in section  [ sec : restr - transf ] .    section  [ sec : uneq - plac - agents ] deals with the setting of unequally placed companies , where some companies possess the capital of others and so simple",
    "addition of capital amounts would lead to double counting .",
    "it is shown that this setting can be naturally incorporated in our set - valued framework .    separating the financial outcome after a certain period from the ( possibly restricted ) transfers between the companies ( or in other applications between portfolios ) can lead to diversification effects that are _ different _ from the usual case of convex risk measures , since not all of them work in the same direction , see section  [ sec : divers - effects ] .    in section  [ sec : num - examples ]",
    "we discuss the computation of the relevant sets , give inner and outer bounds which can be easily implemented and discuss some numerical examples .",
    "our setting differs from studies of systemic risk , where the individual acceptability of each agent does not suffice for the acceptability of the whole financial network , see @xcite . while , in common with the studies of systemic risks in @xcite , our approach involves inverting a set - valued risk measure , it does not rely on considering an equilibrium in the system of agents .",
    "a very basic but key observation for market regulators is that it is not in the obligation of an insurance group but of individual legal entities to pay for claims of policy holders .",
    "this basic observation can become particularly relevant under stress . in view of that",
    ", it has often been emphasized in the literature that risk assessment and capital requirements for groups of companies should take place on an individual basis , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this means that each legal entity is requested to set aside the capital necessary to make its risk acceptable .",
    "this approach is often called _ legal entity approach_.    the legal entity approach appears in two basic variants :  stand - alone and granular . in the _ stand - alone _ solvency assessment , the capital amounts ( net assets ) of each legal entity are modeled separately and regarded as random variables on a probability space that might differ between the legal entities .",
    "all other group members are considered as third parties , i.e.  are treated in the same way as non - members of the group .",
    "the _ granular _ approach aims at developing a _ joint _ model for all legal entities in a group .",
    "the existence of the group has an impact on the legal entities , meaning that effects of the group on individual entities should constitute a part of the model .",
    "these effects result from certain igts and ownership relations within the group and should hence be taken into account in the model .",
    "typical examples are reinsurance agreements , financial guarantees , and intragroup loans . while the whole collection of capital positions for all involved legal entities is modeled as a random vector , the granular approach assesses each of its components separately and these depend on the igts chosen by the group .",
    "in particular note that in this _ existing _ solvency test the capital requirement is _ not _ given by a _",
    "single figure_.    as opposed to the stand - alone approach , the granular approach relies on joint modeling of the capital amounts and igts so that the information on other entities and the random variables describing their capital positions flows directly and consistently into the modeling of any particular component . in other words ,",
    "the granular approach relies on the modeling of each particular component on a richer probability space .",
    "this may lead to _ different marginal distributions _ between the stand - alone and the granular approach .",
    "hence , it seems to be almost impossible to suitably model on a stand - alone basis the particularly dangerous situation where several group members simultaneously run into problems .",
    "mathematically speaking , consider @xmath0 legal entities whose terminal capital positions are described by the vector @xmath1 . since the main point of this paper is to separate the financial positions after the relevant time period from the set of admissible igts we will later assume that @xmath2 is the capital position of all agents _ without _ any igts .",
    "it is assumed that the risks of the legal entities are evaluated using monetary risk measures , namely the risk measure @xmath3 for the @xmath4th legal entity .",
    "the individual risks of each legal entity after igts build the vector @xmath5 where the position @xmath6 represents the capital positions after igts .",
    "it is regarded acceptable if @xmath7 for all @xmath4 , meaning that @xmath8 , where the inequality between vectors is understood coordinatewisely and so means that @xmath9 has all non - positive components .",
    "intragroup transactions can be used for increasing the `` diversification '' of risks within the group , and so they _ can _ be in the interest of all policy holders , see e.g.  @xcite , if they are applied in _ reality_. in particular , igts may be used to offset the risks of some , e.g.  poorly performing , legal entities , while not necessarily immediately diminishing the disposable assets of other legal entities .",
    "since the igts can reduce the solvency capital requirements , it is important that they are not of a purely hypothetical nature .",
    "thus , they have to be",
    "_ realistic _ in situations when they are needed .",
    "the family of feasible transfers depends on whether or not the group is in a stressed situation , i.e.  they are particularly exposed to _ fungibility risks _ , as is well - known in practice .",
    "furthermore , note that not all policy holders ( of different legal entities within a group ) have the same interests .",
    "hence , igts have to be `` sufficiently balanced '' with respect to the interests of all _ policy holders_. it is important to note that igts have a general potential for being misused .",
    "thus , even if transfers are based on legally binding and enforceable contracts , it is still possible that the corresponding transfers are not realistic , not sufficiently in line with the interests of some policy holders , etc .",
    ", so that other / further restrictions may have to be taken into account .",
    "the decision about the restrictions , which are finally taken into account in a concrete solvency framework is a political and legal but not mathematical question , therefore it is not addressed in this paper .",
    "however , what we provide here is a tool to translate restrictions into a quantitative risk management framework .",
    "it becomes increasingly popular in practice to regard the group as acceptable if the random variable @xmath10 is acceptable with respect to a prescribed risk measure .. ] this approach is called the _ consolidated solvency test_. it is a frequently discussed interpretation that the classical consolidated approach _",
    "implicitly _ assumes full fungibility of capital between all different legal entities of the group , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "filipovi and kupper @xcite and filipovi and kunz @xcite made an important step towards understanding intra group diversification and quantifying regulatory schemes being sandwiched between the granular approach without any admissible igts , in the following called _ strictly granular _ , and the consolidated solvency tests .",
    "concrete examples are based on dividend payments and reinsurance contracts and are described by some random transfer instruments ( linearly independent random variables ) @xmath11 , so that the terminal risk profile of each agent is given by @xmath12 where the transferred amounts @xmath13 belong to a specified ( feasible ) subset of @xmath14 and satisfy the clearing condition @xmath15 it is assumed in  @xcite that the group aims to minimise the aggregate required group capital @xmath16 subject to the feasibility and clearing conditions on the weights @xmath17 .",
    "apart from the mentioned independency assumption , @xcite assume a single currency setting , absence of transaction costs , that the weights are deterministic numbers and that the admissible transfers are restricted to be a linear combination of fixed instruments without explicit fungibility constraints that depends on the level of distress a group is exposed to .",
    "fungibility constraints on possible dividend payments are considered in the very concrete bottom - up group diversification analysis presented in  @xcite .",
    "the natural link between admissible igts and the minimization problem of the total required capital of the group , which is emphasized in  @xcite , relates this work to the extensive literature on _ optimal risk sharing _ , see e.g.  @xcite and the literature cited therein . for optimization under restriction to certain so - called cash invariant sets we refer to  @xcite , partially based on  @xcite , for portfolios of risk vectors ( including the influence of dependence on the risk of a portfolio ) see  @xcite .    in the interest of brevity ,",
    "the main focus of this paper concerning the granular approach is on the task to directly include concrete admissibility constraints for igts in a solvency framework without restricting the analysis to concretely given contracts , and we leave to agents the task of choosing specific igts from the family of admissible ones .    from a practical perspective , groups may not necessarily aim to minimize the total capital requirement , since some legal entities may have different placements or roles within the group ( like subsidiaries and head offices ) , some may be reluctant to commit own capital in order to compensate the losses of other legal entities or may do this only given certain conditions ( that are random ) , etc . in view of this , the total required capital for the group may not serve as a right utility for the group , or at least the agents might seek to minimize the total required capital only under additional constraints that do not seem to be reflected in the literature so far .",
    "the consolidated solvency approach is based on the acceptability of the random variable in  ( [ eq : def - d ] ) , where the group is simply considered as if it were one `` legal entity '' .",
    "it is the default case in solvency  ii . since july 2015",
    "the default case of the sst is also based on this approach .",
    "however the regulator may impose additional requirements concerning availability and fungibility of capital within the group and also impose capital add - ons in case of seriously restricted fungibility that is not reflected in the models . in view of that , it is essential to derive a proper and mathematically well - founded way of describing transfer possibilities within the group and to find and to derive a framework which allows to _ adequately _ include fungibility constraints into the consolidated framework .    by translating the consolidated test into the unconstrained solvency test in the subadditive case ,",
    "we show that no fungibility constraints are taken into account in the risk - measurement .",
    "we also suggest a framework that represents fungibility constraints in a solvency test via simply and explicitly restricting the set of admissible transfers .",

    "fixed transaction costs , each recipient surrenders a fixed amount @xmath425 , so that @xmath426 this provides an example of a non - convex set of igts that also does not depend on @xmath2 .    a particularly important case of transaction costs relates to the case where agents operate in different currencies",
    ". then transfers between the currencies are subject to transaction costs and may also involve random exchange rates . in this case , it is also problematic to consider the total risk , since there is no natural reference currency to express the risks of all agents .",
    "we leave this setting for future work .",
    "most financial groups exhibit some hierarchical structures , namely there are parent and subsidiary agents , and even cross - holdings between different members of the same group often exist . for simplicity",
    ", consider the case of two agents : the first agent with capital @xmath78 is a subsidiary and the second one with capital @xmath294 is a holding ( or parent ) .",
    "the parent company owns an option on the ( full ) available capital of the subsidiary , e.g.  via liquidation , i.e.  the parent has a long position in the derivative with payoff @xmath427 .",
    "assume that the parent has no other assets or liabilities , so that her capital is @xmath428 .    in this case , adding capital amounts would incur double counting of the positive part of @xmath78 . such double counting",
    "is typically excluded in previous works on optimal risk sharing , see  @xcite . in our framework , it is possible to avoid double counting by adjusting the random set of attainable positions .    in view of the fact that a parent company ultimately has the legal right to get the ( full ) capital from the subsidiary , without an additional contract the parent can add the positive part of the capital of the subsidiary to its assets , and hence , to its capital .",
    "consequently the subsidiary acquires the corresponding short position , which has to be considered in the risk calculation of the subsidiary , so that its consistent capital becomes @xmath429 , where @xmath430 is the so - called limited liability put option .",
    "thus , the net capital of the subsidiary is never strictly positive , for instance , the subsidiary would never be acceptable , except in cases where the capital of the subsidiary after taking into account the participations is concentrated at zero , which might happen , if the subsidiary were `` long only '' in assets while being completely financed by equity .    for the capital position @xmath431 , in",

    "assume that the risks of the both group members are assessed using the same coherent risk measure @xmath135 .",
    "thus , in the strictly granular setting , the total risk amounts to @xmath434    allowing for igts , for any state of the world one has to fix the transfer from the parent to the subsidiary , which is the only feasible transfer direction .",
    "for this , the parent obtains a loan @xmath266 secured upon @xmath428 , and we do not take into account any fungibility difficulties that might occur in this relation . from this loan a random amount @xmath62 is due to be transferred to the subsidiary at the terminal time . if @xmath435 , then the transferred amount is immediately recovered and the loan is repaid , while if @xmath436 , then the parent recovers @xmath437 .",
    "the set @xmath150 of attainable positions is characterized by @xmath395 given by @xmath438 for all possible transfers @xmath62 , which are random variables taking values in @xmath439 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding `` total risk '' becomes @xmath440 in view of the subadditivity of the risk measure . in the hypothetical case of an unlimited credit line , the equality , and thus , the optimal transfer is achieved if @xmath441 .",
    "the policy holders of a parent could benefit from the investment in the subsidiary without directly affecting reserves of the policy holders of the subsidiary , if the parent sells the subsidiary at the terminal time to a third party . since this strategy needs a buyer in a potentially stressed market it is possibly , from the initial time point of view , recommendable not to fully take into account this possibility in a prudent regulation .",
    "filipovi  and kunz  @xcite present a bottom - up approach to analyse intragroup diversification in a very concrete setting with given distributions and choice of predefined igts . for a rather recent similar analysis ,",
    "see also  @xcite .",
    "the key property of coherent risk measures is their subadditivity that corresponds to the fact that diversification decreases risk .",
    "the non - linear feature of the igts brings new features to the diversification effects .",
    "for example , in many cases , e.g.  in the ntbcase , @xmath442 where both @xmath187 and @xmath443 are @xmath0-dimensional vectors of capital values . then the diversification of assets and liabilities narrows the range of admissible igts . on the other side ,",
    "there exists a classical benefit from diversification effects .",
    "a similar situation arises in the diversification effects for systemic risks , see @xcite .    in order to understand the diversification effects in the group setting ,",
    "consider the one - dimensional case from the point of view of the group .",
    "let @xmath187 and @xmath443 be two @xmath33-integrable random variables and let @xmath135 be a univariate coherent @xmath37-risk measure . define @xmath444 to be a random vector in @xmath445 and let @xmath273 .",
    "in view of the subadditivity of @xmath135 the total risk of @xmath2 with the igts given by @xmath251 equals @xmath446 , while if @xmath447 , then the total risk becomes @xmath448 .",
    "thus , the classical diversification benefit can be phrased as the advantage that corresponds to increasing the set of admissible igts from @xmath449 to @xmath272 , in other words , from altering the strictly granular approach to the unconstrained one .",
    "related to that , it should be stressed that a solvency test should never include unrealistic transfers , since otherwise the solvency test tends to underestimate the real risks a group is faced with .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that classical diversification compares @xmath448 with the risk of a particular selection of @xmath285 , namely that of @xmath450 .",
    "the classical concept of diversification is inherent for a single agent , who might have several business units with unrestricted capital flows between them . in case of groups ,",
    "we see two basic effects :    * _ consolidation _ that amounts to increasing the set of admissible igts ; * _ granularization _ that corresponds to restricting the family of admissible igts .",
    "in particular , a merger of two legal entities removes all fungibility barriers between them , as in the case of unconstrained approach , and so is a simple example of consolidation . on the contrary",
    ", a split may lead to some additional restrictions in capital transfers that can be viewed as granularization .    consider the group @xmath1 and assume that the first agent splits its operation into two subsidiaries so that @xmath451 .",
    "the effect of such granularization on the total risk depends on the set of admissible transfers between the two created subsidiaries and between them and the rest of the group .",
    "for instance , the total risk is retained if the two subsidiaries are considered on the unconstrained basis .",
    "consider a single agent with terminal capital @xmath6 that is split into @xmath286 , so that @xmath452 .",
    "the total risk after such granularization under a coherent risk measure @xmath135 lies between @xmath453 in the unconstrained case and @xmath454 in the strictly granular setting .",
    "if two groups are merged , a classical question is , whether or not also some of the legal entities ( like two life- or non - life companies ) should also be merged . consider two groups @xmath455 and @xmath456 .",
    "their merge creates a new group @xmath2 with @xmath457 legal entities , so that one has to specify the family @xmath458 of admissible igts .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath459 and @xmath460 , meaning that the families @xmath461 and @xmath462 of admissible igts within each of two primary groups are admissible after the merge .",
    "still the larger group may be allowed to transfer capital between the components of @xmath187 and @xmath443 . in view of this , @xmath463 note that the coherence of components of @xmath50 is not needed for this .",
    "hence , if two groups are merged without any merger of the legal entities we can expect ( e.g.  if the above assumptions are satisfied ) the total risk to be subadditive . however , if we start to merge also legal entities , the situation is less clear due to reverse effects from  .",
    "thus , in the context of risk assessment for groups , the diversification advantage can be formulated as follows .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ granularization does not diminish the risk , while consolidation does not increase the risk .",

    "the calculation of the group risk requires finding @xmath71 such that the selection risk measure of @xmath160 contains the origin .",
    "this is a serious computational problem , that can be solved by means of multicriterial optimization algorithms , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , bounds on the group risk can be obtained as follows , see theorem  [ cor : lower - bound ] .      in the following ,",
    "assume that @xmath50 has all identical coherent components . in case of two agents , the calculation of the superset for the group risk",
    "can often be simplified by the following proposition .",
    "it suffices to show that if @xmath468 for the three above mentioned @xmath133 , then the inequality holds for all @xmath469 . without loss of generality",
    "assume that @xmath470 .",
    "the condition means that @xmath471 is the segment with two end - points @xmath472 and @xmath473 , where @xmath474 are two non - negative random variables that might depend on @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath475 if @xmath476 , then @xmath477 the coherency of the risk measure yields that the risk of @xmath478 is acceptable if both @xmath479 and @xmath480 are .",
    "the case of @xmath481 is similar .    in the following",
    "we choose the ntb  restrictions for two agents , possibly with safety margins , where proposition  [ prop : convex - combination ] clearly applies . in case of a fixed safety margin @xmath482",
    ", the group risk is a subset of @xmath483 note that the last inequality defines a half - plane corresponding to the unconstrained setting . in the case of zero safety margin ,",
    "the first two inequalities are superfluous , and so the superset from proposition  [ prop : bounds ] does not differ from the group risk in the unconstrained setting . indeed , if @xmath484 , then without loss of generality we can assume the equality , so that @xmath485",
    ". then the first inequality in requires @xmath486 or , equivalently , @xmath487 which always holds , since @xmath488 .    in order to obtain a subset of @xmath169 , choose the selection @xmath464 as the point of @xmath206 that is nearest to the diagonal line @xmath489 .",
    "then @xmath490 if @xmath491 . if @xmath492 , then @xmath493 in case @xmath494 , @xmath495 if @xmath496 , and @xmath497 if @xmath498",
    ". thus , @xmath499 is acceptable if @xmath500 the inner approximation in is obtained as the set of all @xmath501 such that the above inequalities hold with @xmath286 replaced by @xmath502 , where @xmath482 denotes the fixed safety margin .",
    "an upper bound for the total risk is obtained by finding the minimum of @xmath503 that satisfy these inequalities .",
