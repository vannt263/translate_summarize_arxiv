    "6 , the simulated average sum rate of the x - duplex system versus self interference with different levels of transmit power is depicted . in the weak self interference region , fd achieves a higher sum rate than hd . as self interference increases ,",
    "the average sum rate of fd mode significantly decreases and performs worse than the hd mode .",
    "the average sum rate of x - duplex relay system is always better than fd and hd mode .",
    "the performance of x - duplex decreases quickly with the self interference increases , and is most obvious at high snr . when the self interference is perfectly cancelled , the average sum rate of x - duplex is twice that of hd mode .",
    "7 illustrates the outage probability of xd - pa subject to the total power constraint .",
    "the performance of the x - duplex relay system with uniform power allocation , is illustrated for comparison . according to this figure ,",
    "the outage probability performance of x - duplex relay system can be improved with adaptive power allocation compared with equal power allocation .",
    "the diversity order of xd - pa is between one and two .",
    "the performance of fd with power allocation is also plotted for comparison and the diversity order of fd - pa is between @xmath163 and one .",
    "it can observed that the diversity order of x - duplex is higher than fd with pa at high snr , which coincide with the analysis in section iii e.    .,width=384 ]      the system model of hybrid fd / hd relaying  @xcite , rams scheme  @xcite and x - duplex in this paper can be classified into three categories according to the deployment of antennas at the relay : ( a ) separated antenna without antenna selection [ 21 ] , ( b ) separated antenna with antenna selection [ 20 ] , ( c ) shared antenna in this paper .",
    "the major differences between these three categories can be summarized as follows :    _ structure and implementation : _ in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , the number of antennas at the relay are two , two and one , respectively .",
    "the connection between the antenna and rf chain is fixed in ( a ) , however it is flexible in ( b ) and ( c ) . in ( a ) and ( b ) , as",
    "the channels between the source and two antennas at relay may be different in practical scenarios , we need to determine which antenna is selected as tx antenna , and the other as rx antenna . in ( a ) , the decision is made at deployment time and the configuration of each antenna is fixed . in ( b ) , as each antenna can be configured as tx or rx antenna , the deployment of antennas is simpler compared with ( a ) .",
    "however , the decision system could be more complex as two antennas can be adaptively configured according to instantaneous channel information and thus more operating modes need to be considered compared with ( a ) . in [ 20 ] , there are two fd modes where two antennas are configured as tx / rx or rx / tx . in a shared antenna relay system ( c ) , since tx / rx share one single antenna , there will be no tx / rx selection process involved as there is only one channel between the source and relay .",
    "_ performance : _ compared with ( a ) , the system in ( b ) can provide an additional spatial diversity gain at the destination and improve the performance with efficient utilization of two antennas . specifically , considering one relay , the system in ( b ) achieves twice of the diversity order at low to medium snrs and a lower error floor at high snrs compared with the fixed antenna configuration ( a ) operating at fd mode [ 20 ] . comparing ( c ) and ( a ) , one shared antenna can operate the same way as two separated fixed antennas .",
    "the shared antenna can exploit antenna resources more efficiently compared with fixed antennas .",
    "thus , ( c ) is more suitable to be deployed into small equipments , such as mobile phone , small sensor nodes .",
    "the performance of x - duplex relaying system in ( c ) is the same as that of hybrid fd / hd switching in ( a ) .    _",
    "complexity : _ in ( a ) and ( c ) , the csis of three channels , including the channel from source to relay , the channel from relay to destination and the self interference channel , need to be measured and sent to the decision node for decision through feedback channels , which requires @xmath173 feedback overhead . in ( b ) , the csis of 5n channels , including 2n channels from the source to n relays for two antenna modes at relay , n self - interference channel at n relays , and 2n channels from n relays to the destination for two antenna modes at relay , requires the feedback overhead of @xmath174 . from this perspective , the complexity of ( a ) and ( c ) is the same and smaller than that of ( b ) where more csis need to be estimated and transmitted .",
    "in this paper , we investigated a x - duplex relay for the af relay network , in which the relay is equipped with a shared antenna . by adaptively configuring the antenna connection with two rf chains ,",
    "the x - duplex relay system can achieve a better performance than both hd and fd schemes and eliminate the performance floor of fd caused by the residual self - interference .",
    "we also designed the xd - pa subject to the total power constraint to further improve the performance .",
    "asymptotic expressions of the cdf , outage probability , average ser performance , and average sum rate were derived .",
    "the analytic results were validated by computer simulations .",
    "both analysis and simulations demonstrated the superiority of the x - duplex relay over both fd and hd schemes .",
    "the fd mode s end - to - end sinr is given in ( 7 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath175 is mentioned in @xcite @xmath176 the cdf of the end - to - end sinr is expressed as @xmath177    the integral in ( [ fxx ] ) does not possess a closed - form solution in the scope of our knowledge .",
