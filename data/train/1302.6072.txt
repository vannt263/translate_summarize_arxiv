    "atomic gases composed of closed - shell diamagnetic atoms are optically isotropic .",
    "this means that the speed of light traversing the gas sample is independent of the polarization of the light .",
    "external fields , like the electric or the magnetic fields , strongly modify refractive properties of gases leading to the optical anisotropy of the gas in the field . the optical birefringence of the refractive index of isotropic gases in the electric field was first observed by john kerr in 1875 @xcite .",
    "kerr discovered that the refractive coefficient of a gas changes depending on the polarization of light with respect to the direction of the external static electric field .",
    "he found that the difference between the refractive coefficients for the light with parallel and perpendicular polarizations with respect to the field vector , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , is proportional to the square of the electric field @xmath3 : @xmath4 where the proportionality constant has been referred to as the kerr constant . in 1955",

    "buckingham and pople @xcite modified the expression for the cotton - mouton constant in the spirit of the modified definition of the kerr constant , i.e. essentially by taking the limit of the above expression to the zero magnetic field .",
    "it was observed experimentally that at very low gas number densities @xmath7 the kerr constant @xmath8 depends linearly on @xmath7 , and the proportionality coefficient is proportional to the atomic second hyperpolarizability . at higher pressures departure from the ideal gas law is observed , and it was shown that terms quadratic , cubic , and higher in @xmath7 contribute to @xmath8 @xcite . for dilute gases the quadratic term is dominant , and",

[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the second cotton - mouton virial coefficient as a function of the temperature @xmath23 in the range from 4 k to 323 k is reported in table [ tab4 ] and graphically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . as inspection of table [ tab4 ] and",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that the cotton - mouton virial coefficient is a smooth function of the temperature slowly increasing with @xmath23 . at all temperatures considered in the present paper @xmath188",
    "is negative .",
    "also reported in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are the contributions to @xmath188 from @xmath168 and @xmath167 . similarly as in the case of the kerr virial coefficient at low temperatures the contribution from @xmath168 largely dominates .",
    "only around 200 k @xmath168 and @xmath167 become equal , and at room temperature @xmath167 is larger , although not dominant .    in table",
    "[ tab4 ] we also report the classical term and the sum of the semiclassical expansion through the second order . similarly as in the case of the kerr virial coefficient the classical expression works well up to the temperatures of @xmath189100 k or higher . at lower temperatures",
    "quantum effects start to play the game , but still the semiclassical expansion effectively takes into account quantum effects at temperatures as low as 40 k. indeed , at @xmath190 k the error of the semiclassical result with respect to the full quantum result is only 4% . at still lower temperatures",
    "it diverges very fast .",
    "for instance , at @xmath191 k the semiclassical result overestimates ( in the absolute value ) the quantum result by 51% , and at 15 k its absolute value is almost three times larger .",
    "there were a few measurements of the cotton - mouton effect in helium-4 gas @xcite in the temperature range between 285 k and 300 k , i.e. close to the room temperature , and at relatively low gas number densities ( the pressure of 1 atm , and gas number density of the order of @xmath192 atoms per @xmath193 ) .",
    "measurements in refs .",
    "@xcite were performed for a single gas pressure , assuming that a linear dependence of the cotton - mouton effect on the gas density is fulfilled . also in these experiments",
    "the uncertainty of the measurements was relatively high , of the order of 20% , which precluded observation of any fine effects due to the interatomic interactions .",
    "the most accurate experimental data for the cotton - mouton effect in helium were reported in ref .  @xcite . although the precision of measurements was much higher than in the previous experiments it was only possible to observe the linear term in the virial expansion ( [ cvir ] ) . on the basis of our results",
    "we predict a contribution of the cotton - mouton virial coefficient to the cotton - mouton constant @xmath9 between 3.7 ppm at the room temperature to 14.8 ppm at @xmath194 k for the largest gas number density considered in ref .",
    "thus , it seems that similarly as in the case of the kerr effect , experimental observation of the effect of interatomic interactions on the cotton - mouton constant for helium gas will be very challenging .",
    "the results reported in the present paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "theory of the birefringence of the refractive index in atomic diamagnetic dilute gases in the presence of static electric ( optical kerr effect ) and magnetic ( cotton - mouton effect ) fields was formulated , and virial expansions of the kerr and cotton - mouton constants as power series in the gas number density @xmath7 were derived . it was shown that both virial coefficients can rigorously be related to the difference of the fourth derivatives of the thermodynamic ( pressure ) virial coefficient with respect to the strength of the non - resonant optical fields with parallel and perpendicular polarizations and with respect to the external static ( electric or magnetic ) field .",
    "explicit quantum - statistical expressions for the second kerr and cotton - mouton virial coefficients valid both in the low and high temperature regime in terms of the collision - induced electric and magnetic properties , and eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the field free hamiltonian describing relative nuclear motion of two interacting atoms were derived .",
    "our quantum - statistical expressions are significantly different from the approximate expressions reported by rizzo and collaborators @xcite .",
    "semiclassical expansion of the second kerr virial coefficient as a power series in @xmath127 was derived , and explicit expressions for the first and second quantum corrections to the classical expression were reported .",
    "the consecutive terms in the semiclassical expansion were expressed as one - dimensional integrals involving the boltzmann factor @xmath195 and some functions depending on the potential , collision - induced properties , and their derivatives with respect to the interatomic distance @xmath139 .",
    "both the second kerr and cotton - mouton virial coefficients are smooth functions of the temperature .",
    "the kerr virial coefficient monotonically decreases with the temperature and around the room temperature it crosses zero and becomes negative .",
    "the cotton - mouton virial coefficient is also a monotonic function of the temperature . in the range of temperatures considered in the present paper",
    "it is always negative and slowly increases with @xmath23 .",
    "semiclassical expansions through the second order are shown to diverge at low temperatures . however , for helium gas they account for all major quantum effects up to the temperatures of @xmath18950 k. at @xmath196 k the errors of the semiclassical expansion of the kerr and cotton - mouton virial coefficients with respect to the quantum results are 0.7% and 1.7% , respectively .",
    "the simplest pad approximant greatly improves the convergence , and effectively sums up the divergent series at temperatures as low as 20 k. in the temperature range where the semiclassical expansion is valid , the semiclassical and full quantum results agree better , than the approximate results according to ref . @xcite and present quantum results . 5 .   despite many efforts , neither the kerr nor cotton - mouton virial coefficients could be measured for the helium gas thus far .",
    "based on the present numerical results , estimates of the temperature range for which the effects could be observed were reported .",
    "they mostly concern very low temperatures that are not easily accessible to the gas phase experiments .",
    "it seems that experimental data for other light atomic gas like neon are necessary to judge the importance of the quantum effects on the optical birefringence at very low temperatures .",
