    "minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) is the most economic extension that can solve the naturalness problem associated with the higgs sector of the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "it is an economical description since it is based on the particle spectrum and gauge structure of the sm .",
    "whether it is supersymmetric or not , if the gauge structure is extended to include new factors or embedded in a larger group then there necessarily arise novel particle spectra and phenomena that can be tested via collider experiments or astrophysical observations .",
    "the simplest gauge extension of the mssm would be to expand its gauge group by an additional abelian factor  to be hereon called @xmath4 invariance .",
    "the most direct motivation for such an extra group factor is the need to solve the @xmath1 problem of the mssm @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mass term of the higgsinos @xmath5 involves a dimensionful parameter @xmath1 which is completely unrelated to the soft supersymmetry breaking sector containing the mass parameters in the theory .",
    "for consistent electroweak breaking , the soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters must lie at the electroweak scale , and there is no clue whatsoever why @xmath1 should be fixed to this very scale . for naturalizing the @xmath1 parameter",
    "a viable approach is to associate @xmath1 to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a new scalar @xcite @xmath6 where the chiral superfield @xmath7 replaces the bare @xmath1 parameter in ( [ superpot - mssm ] ) via @xmath8 with @xmath9 being a yukawa coupling . for the new superpotential not to contain a bare @xmath1 term like ( [ superpot - mssm ] ) it is obligatory that the u(1)@xmath0 charges of the all superfields sum up to zero by gauge invariance @xmath10 clearly , @xmath11 .",
    "these conditions guarantee that a bare @xmath1 term as in ( [ superpot - mssm ] ) is forbidden completely , and @xmath1 parameter is deemed to arise from the vev of @xmath12 via ( [ mu - def ] ) .    every single term in the superpotential satisfies u(1)@xmath0 gauge invariance conditions like ( [ u(1)gauge - inv ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are additional non - trivial constraints necessary to make such models anomaly free , especially when the concerning u(1)@xmath3 model deviates from the authentic e(6 ) structures .",
    "the anomalies can be cancelled either by introducing family non - universal charges @xcite or by importing novel matter species ( mimicking those of guts such as e(6 ) ) ( see the second reference in @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we shall assume that anomalies are cancelled by additional matter falling outside the reach of lhc experiments .",
    "the @xmath1 problem detailed above is not the only motivation for introducing an extra u(1 ) .",
    "indeed , such extra gauge factors , typically more than a single u(1 ) , arise in effective theories stemming from supersymmetric guts and strings @xcite . in such models , the u(1 )",
    "charges of fields are fixed by the unified theory .",
    "these models are phenomenologically rich and theoretically ubiquitous in superstring theories and guts descending from so(10 ) and e(6 ) groups @xcite .",
    "the e(6 ) breaking pattern @xmath13 gives rise to the @xmath14 model at low energies .",
    "each arrow in this chain corresponds to spontaneous symmetry breakdown at a specific energy scale . here , by construction",
    ", @xmath15 is a light @xmath4 invariance broken near the @xmath16 scale whereas the other orthogonal combination @xmath17 is broken at a much higher scale not accessible to lhc experiments .",
    "the angle @xmath18 designates the breaking direction in @xmath19 space and it is a function of the associated gauge couplings and vevs that realize the symmetry breaking .",
    "many other models can be constructed from the combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 models leading to a solution for @xmath1 problem ( an exception is the @xmath21 model ( @xmath22 ) where the singlet @xmath12 acquires vanishing u(1)@xmath0 charge ) @xcite .",
    "the extra u(1 ) gives rise to a number of phenomena not found in the mssm : its gauge boson @xmath23 and gauge fermion @xmath24 cause anomalies in various mssm - specific processes @xcite .",
    "another point as important as these phenomena concerns the higgs sector : the higgs sector of such models differ from those of the sm and mssm not only by the presence of extra higgs states but also by the modifications in the masses and couplings of the higgs bosons @xcite ( for phenomenological consequences of an extra singlet on the masses , couplings and decay widths of higgs bosons the reader can refer to @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the dependencies of the higgs masses on the model parameters are different than in the mssm , and the little hierarchy problem of the mssm seems to be largely softened in such models @xcite .    at the wake of lhc experiments ,",
    "it is convenient to study the higgs boson masses in u(1)@xmath0 models",
    ". apart from various mass and coupling ranges favored by the models , the existing bounds from the lep and tevatron experiments can guide one to more likely regions of the parameter space .",
    "the lep experiments @xcite have ended with a clear preference for the lightest higgs boson mass : @xmath25 the knowledge of the higgs mass has recently been further supported by the tevatron results @xcite which state that the lightest higgs boson can not have a mass in the range @xmath26 it is clear that lep bound influences the parameter spaces of the sm , mssm and its extensions like nmssm and u(1)@xmath0 models .",
    "the reason is that the lep range is covered by all these models of electroweak breaking .",
    "however , it is obvious that the tevatron bound has almost no impact on the mssm parameter space within which @xmath27 can not exceed @xmath28 .",
    "for the same token , however , the tevatron bounds can be quite effective for extensions of the mssm whose lightest higgs bosons can weigh above @xmath29 .",
    "this is the case in nmssm not explored here and in u(1)@xmath0 models @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall analyze u(1)@xmath0 models in regard to their higgs mass predictions and constrained parameter space under the lep as well as tevatron bounds by assuming that the higgs boson searched by d@xmath30 and cdf corresponds to that of the u(1)@xmath0 models .",
    "in course of the analysis , we shall consider the u(1)@xmath0 model achieved by low - energy considerations as well as by high - energy considerations ( the gut and stringy u(1)@xmath0 models mentioned above ) . in each case",
    "we shall scan the parameter space to determine the bounds on the model parameters by imposing the bounds from direct searches .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii below we discuss certain salient features of the u(1)@xmath0 models in regard to collider bounds on @xmath31 . sec",
    "iii is devoted to a detailed analysis of the u(1)@xmath0 models selected . in sec .",
    "iv we conclude .",
    "in this section we provide a brief overview of the fundamental constraints on u(1)@xmath0 model .",
    "first of all , the u(1)@xmath0 model is known to generate the neutrino masses in the correct experimental range via dirac type coupling .",
    "the scalar field @xmath12 responsible for generating the @xmath1 parameter also generates the neutrino dirac masses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the same model offers a viable cold dark matter candidate via the lightest right - handed sneutrino , and accounts for the pamela and fermi lat results for positron excess for a reasonable set of parameters @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no reason for insisting that the neutralino sector offers a cdm candidate .",
    "our focus in this work is on the higgs sector to which neutrino sector gives no significant contribution .",
    "an important point which concerns the anomalies .",
    "a generic u(1)@xmath0 model suffers from triangular anomalies and hence gauge coupling non - unification . in the e(6)-motivated models , by construction , all anomalies automatically cancel out when the complete e(6 ) multiplets are included . for a generic u(1)@xmath0 , with minimal matter spectrum ,",
    "cancellation is nontrivial .",
    "one possibility is to introduce u(1)@xmath0 models with family - dependent charges @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that anomalies are cancelled by heavy states ( beyond the reach of lhc ) weighing near the tev scale .",
    "we shall follow this possibility .",
    "the higgs sector of the model , as mentioned before , involves the singlet higgs @xmath12 and the electroweak doublets @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "all of them are charged under u(1)@xmath0 gauge group .",
    "the higgs fields expand around the vacuum state as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 span the charged sector involving the charged goldstone eaten up by the @xmath37 boson as well as the charged higgs boson .",
    "the remaining ones span the neutral degrees of freedom : @xmath38 are scalars and @xmath39 are pseudoscalars . in the vacuum state",
    "@xmath40 the @xmath37 , @xmath41 and @xmath23 bosons all acquire masses",
    ". however , the neutral gauge bosons @xmath41 and @xmath23 exhibit nontrivial mixing @xcite .",
    "the two eigenvalues of this mixing matrix @xcite give the masses of the physical massive vector bosons ( @xmath42 ) where @xmath43 must agree with the experimental bounds on the @xmath41 boson mass in the mssm ( or sm ) .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath44 @xcite must be a few @xmath45 for precision measurements at lep experiments to be respected .",
    "this puts a bound on the @xmath46 boson mass . in particular , in generic e(6 ) models @xmath47 must weigh nearly a @xmath16 or more according to the tevatron measurements @xcite .    due to the soft breaking of supersymmetry , the higgs boson masses shift in proportion to particle  sparticle mass splitting under quantum corrections .",
    "though all particles which couple to the higgs fields @xmath12 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 contribute to the higgs boson masses , the largest correction comes from the top quark and its superpartner scalar top quark ( and to a lesser extent from the bottom quark multiplet ) . including top and bottom quark superfields , the superpotential takes the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are top and bottom yukawa couplings .",
    "clearly @xmath53 .",
    "this superpotential encodes the dominant couplings of the higgs fields which determine the @xmath54term contributions .",
    "effective potential proves to be an efficient method for computing the radiative corrections to higgs potential .",
    "in fact , the radiatively corrected potential reads as @xmath55 where the tree level potential is composed of @xmath54term , @xmath56term and soft  breaking pieces @xmath57 with @xmath58\\,,\\\\ & & v_d   = \\frac{g^2}{8 }   \\left(|h_u|^2 - |h_d|^2 \\right ) + \\frac{g_2 ^ 2}{2 } \\left ( |h_u|^2 |h_d|^2 - |h_u \\cdot h_d|^2 \\right ) + \\frac{{g^\\prime_y}^2}{2 } \\left ( q_{h_u }    & & v_{soft } = m_{h_u}^2 |h_u|^2 + m_{h_d}^2 |h_d|^2 + m_s^2|s|^2 + ( h_s a_s s h_u \\cdot h_d + h.c.)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the contributions of the quantum fluctuations in ( [ total - pot ] ) read as @xmath59\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the usual supertrace which generates a factor of @xmath61 for squarks and @xmath62 for quarks .",
    "@xmath63 is the renormalization scale and @xmath64 is the field - dependent mass matrix of quarks and squarks ( we take @xmath65 ) .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from top quark ( and bottom quark , to a lesser extent ) multiplet .",
    "the requisite top and bottom quark field - dependent masses read as @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the mass - squareds of their superpartners follow from @xmath68 where @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "for instance , the entries of the stop mass - squared matrix read to be @xmath71    insertion of the top and bottom mass matrices into ( [ deltav ] ) generates the full one - loop effective potential .",
    "radiatively corrected higgs masses and mixings are computed from the effective potential @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall perform a numerical analysis of higgs boson masses in order to determine the allowed regions under the lep and tevatron bounds . our results , with a sufficiently wide range for each parameter ,",
    "can shed light on the relevant regions of the parameter space to be explored by the experiments at cern . in the following",
    "we will first discuss the parameter space to be employed , and then we shall provide a set of figures each probing certain parameter ranges in the u(1)@xmath0 models considered .",
    "in course of the analysis , we shall partly scan the parameter space and partly analyze certain parameter regions which best exhibit the bounds from the higgs mass measurements .",

    "we thus call all the models we investigate as ` unconstrained u(1)@xmath0 models ' , or , uu(1)@xmath0 models , in short",
    ".    we shall be dealing with four different uu(1)@xmath3 models :    * uu(1)@xmath0 from e(6 ) supersymmetric gut : the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath20 models .",

    "we use the same symbols but mutate them by giving up the typically - assumed value @xmath78 ( obtained by one - step gut breaking ) , and changing it in the range @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "the motivation behind this mutation of the e(6)-based u(1)@xmath0 groups is that one - step gut breaking is too unrealistic to follow ; the gut group is broken at various steps as indicated in ( [ e6-break ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , large values of @xmath81 may be inadmissibly large for perturbative dynamics , and we shall note this feature while interpreting the figures . despite this , however , by varying the @xmath81 we will treat e(6)-based models as some kind of specific uu@xmath3 models in which we can probe the impact of different @xmath82 values on the lightest higgs mass .    unlike the e(6)-based models , we adopt the value of @xmath81 from one - step gut breaking in analyzing the @xmath77 model . in @xmath77 model , by the need to cancel the anomalies , we assume that there exist an unspecified sector of fairly light chiral fields , and normalization of the charge and other issues depend on that sector @xcite",

    "our shading convention is the same as in fig .",
    "the inputs are selected as : @xmath157 to @xmath158 with increments 200 gev in @xmath74 and @xmath20 models . in @xmath77 and @xmath73 models we scan @xmath159 from 0.5 to @xmath158 with increments 100 gev .",
    "these inputs are also used in the following figure . in any panel of the figures we observe a hierarchy such that largest @xmath159 value corresponds to the largest @xmath27 value ( topmost data lines ) which is fixed at @xmath109.,height=434 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is possible to read out certain likely ranges for stop and higgs boson masses , which will be key observables in collider experiments like lhc and ilc .",

    "i. e. _ below @xmath166 .",
    "contrary to model @xmath77 , e(6)-based models @xmath74 and @xmath20 allow the @xmath167 mass to be more confined , _",

    "i. e. _ when heavier higgs bosons decouple from @xmath180 one expects the mass hierarchy @xmath181 .",
    "it is thus convenient to analyze the model in regard to its higgs mass spectra to determine in what regime the model is working . to this end",
    ", we depict variations of @xmath27 with @xmath177 , @xmath182 and @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for quantifying the analysis",
    "we define the ratios @xmath183 , @xmath184 which are , respectively , shown by gray and black dots in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , shown in the leftmost column are variations of @xmath27 with @xmath177 ( black dots ) and with @xmath175 ( grey dots ) .",
    "it is clear that , the @xmath77 and @xmath74 models are well inside the decoupling regime for the parameter ranges considered . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath73 models , especially the @xmath73 model , are far from their decoupling regime . in this regime",
    ", the lightest higgs can weigh well above its lower bound .",
    "one notices that , @xmath172 and @xmath170 bosons exhibit no sign of degeneracy in the @xmath73 model .",
    "the variations of @xmath27 with @xmath182 and @xmath47 are shown in the middle column of fig .",
    "one observes that grand behavior is similar to those in the first column .",
    "one , however , makes the distinction that @xmath27 depends violently on @xmath182 and @xmath47 in @xmath77 and @xmath73 models while it stays almost completely independent for @xmath20 and @xmath74 models .",
    "all the properties summarized above are quantified in the third column wherein @xmath27 is plotted against @xmath178 and @xmath179 . the degree to which @xmath185 measure close to unity give a quantitative measure of how close the parameter values are to the decoupling regime .",
    "one notices that they differ significantly from unity in @xmath73 and @xmath20 models . in summary",
    ", @xmath175/@xmath177 ratio drops to @xmath186 in @xmath73 model .",
    "this is also true for @xmath187 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that @xmath178 and @xmath179 behave very similar in most of the parameter space .",
    "this figure depicts the heavy model dependency of neutral higgs masses .",
    "experiments at the lhc and ilc will be able to measure all these higgs boson masses , couplings and decay modes @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath73 and @xmath20 ( especially @xmath20 ) model yield lightest of @xmath188 among all the models considered .",
    "in course of collider searches , these two models will be differentiated from the others by their relatively light heavy - higgs sector .",
    "in this work we have studied the lightest higgs boson mass in uu(1)@xmath0 models against various model parameters and particle masses .",
    "the model possesses a number of distinctive features not found in the mssm : the presence of the heaviest higgs boson @xmath171 ( in addition to @xmath170 and @xmath172 present in the mssm , all studied in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) as well as the @xmath111 dependencies of the sfermion masses ( studied in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . concerning lep higgs measurements , it is known that , bounds on the lightest higgs boson in u(1)@xmath3 extensions are similar to that of the mssm , but its upper bound is relaxed @xcite . we have found rather generically that the lep bounds constrain all four models we have considered .",
    "the tevatron bounds , on the other hand , become effective for the @xmath77 model , primarily .",
    "these are felt also by the @xmath20 and @xmath74 models ( to a lesser extent than the @xmath77 model ) ; however , the @xmath73 model yields fundamentally light @xmath180 boson whose mass never nears the tevatron forbidden band .",
    "nevertheless , one concludes from the remaining three models that , the tevatron bounds generically divide all model parameters in two disjoint ranges : those pertaining to low - mass domain and those to high - mass domain .",
    "for instance , the higgsino yukawa coupling @xmath9 , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , requires large ( close to unity ) values to elevate @xmath27 above the tevatron s upper limit _",
    "i. e. _ @xmath189 .",
    "this kind of restriction is seen also for other parameters , especially , the u(1)@xmath0 gauge coupling @xmath81 ( which needs to take large values close to @xmath190 to push @xmath27 in the tevatron territory in the models stemming from e(6 ) breaking ) .    in any case ,",
    "at least for the parameter ranges considered , one achieves at the firm conclusion that the tevatron bounds can rule out certain portions of the parameter space ( as can be seen specially from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . of course",
    ", this is in accord with the case whether @xmath27 is lying above or below the tevatron exclusion limits .",
    "for instance , if @xmath191 or higher then higgsino yukawa coupling should be larger than @xmath192 , for @xmath193 or lower than this , yukawa coupling of the singlet should be @xmath96 or smaller according to our @xmath77 model .",
    "besides this we observe that , certain uu@xmath3 models such as the @xmath73 model can be the first one to be ruled out since its @xmath27 prediction is well below the tevatron exclusion limits , even with a unrealistically enhanced ( close to unity ) gauge coupling @xmath117 .",
    "concerning the stop masses , we found that @xmath77 and e(6)-borrowed @xmath194 models are highly sensitive to tevatron ( and any other collider bound ) than in the mssm due to the fact that @xmath111 determines not only the @xmath154 ( as in the mssm ) but also the @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( unlike the mssm ) entries of the stop and sbottom mass - squared matrices . according to the model @xmath77",
    ", rule - outs of stop searches can help to determine whether the lightest higgs boson is lying below or above the tevatron higgs mass measurements .",
    "interestingly , low values of @xmath147 can help to narrow down the range of @xmath27 . on the contrary , e(6)-based models can serve for the same aim , but with the opposite behavior .",
    "this is another important signature of the model - dependence surviving in uu(1)@xmath0 models .",
    "another interesting aspect observed within the models considered is that each model can predict a sensible splitting among @xmath175 and @xmath177 at varying order again in a model dependent fashion . in our examples , their masses are generally larger than 500 gev , and hence , decoupled from the lightest higgs ( especially in @xmath77 and @xmath74 models ) .",
    "additionally , their mass splittings can be as large as tens of gevs in any model ( much larger in @xmath73 and @xmath20 models ) .",
    "these observations also hold for splittings between @xmath167 and @xmath195 masses .",
    "the results found above , though unavoidably carry a degree of model dependence , can be directly tested at the lhc ( and at the ilc with much higher precision ) .",
    "measurements of the higgs mass at the lhc , if turn out to prefer large values like @xmath196 or above , can be interpreted as preferring extensions of the mssm like uu(1)@xmath0 models .",
    "depending on the future exclusion limits , one might find more regions of parameter space excluded .",
    "for instance , if the tevatron exclusion band widens down to @xmath197 border smaller and smaller values of @xmath9 and @xmath198 become relevant .",
    "this limit also forces the remaining heavy higgs bosons to decouple from the light spectrum .",
    "the plots presented in the figures are sufficiently ranged to cover possible developments in future exclusion limits ( which may come form continuing analysis of the tevatron data or from the early lhc data ) .",
