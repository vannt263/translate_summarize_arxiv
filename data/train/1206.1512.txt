    "in spectral graph theory one uses spectral analysis to study the interplay between the topology of a graph and the dynamical processes modelled through the graph @xcite .",
    "in fact , various dynamical processes in disciplines ranging from physics , biology , information theory , and chemistry to technological and social sciences are modelled with graph theory .",
    "therefore , graph theory forms a unified framework for their study @xcite .",
    "in particular , one associates a certain matrix to a graph ( e.g.  the adjacency matrix , the laplacian , the google matrix ) and studies the connection between the spectral properties of this matrix and the properties of the dynamical processes governed through them .",
    "we mention some studies in this context : the stability of synchronization processes @xcite , the robustness and the effective resistance of networks @xcite , error - correcting codes @xcite , etc .",
    "these examples illustrate how spectral graph theory relies to a large extent on the capability of determining spectra of sparse graphs .",
    "it is thus important to develop mathematical methods which allow to derive in a systematic way exact analytical as well as numerical results on spectra of large graphs . for an overview of analytical results on the spectra of infinite graphs we refer to the paper of mohar and woess @xcite .",
    "recently , the development of exact results for large sparse graphs has been reconsidered using ideas from statistical physics of disordered systems . in this approach one",
    "formulates the spectral analysis of graphs in a statistical - mechanics language using a complex valued measure @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is given as the free energy density of this measure , which can be calculated using methods from disordered systems such as the replica method @xcite , the cavity method @xcite or the super - symmetric method @xcite .",
    "this approach is exact for infinitely large graphs that do not contain cycles of finite length . in recent",
    "works the cavity method has been generalized to the study of spectra of graphs with a community structure @xcite and spectra of small - world graphs @xcite .",
    "the replica and cavity methods have also been used to derive the largest eigenvalue of sparse random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "although the cavity method is heuristic , it has been considered in a rigorous setting for undirected sparse graphs using the theory of local weak convergence  @xcite . however , for directed sparse graphs the asymptotic convergence of the spectrum to the resultant cavity expressions has not been shown @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies have shown the asymptotic convergence of the spectrum of highly connected sparse matrices to the circular law @xcite and have proven the asymptotic convergence of the spectrum of markov generators on higly connected random graphs @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , do not concern finitely connected graphs .    in this work",
    "we extend the statistical - mechanics formulation , in particular the cavity method for the spectra of large sparse graphs which are locally tree - like @xcite , to large sparse graphs with many short cycles .",
    "such an extension is relevant because cycles do appear in many real - world systems such as the internet @xcite .",
    "we derive a set of resolvent equations for graph ensembles that contain many cycles of finite length .",
    "these equations are exact for infinitely large ( un)directed husimi graphs @xcite and solving them constitutes an algorithm for determining the spectral density of these graphs .",
    "first , we show how this algorithm determines the spectra of irregular husimi graphs up to a high accuracy , well corroborated by numerical simulations .",
    "then we derive novel analytical results not only for the spectra of undirected regular husimi graphs , but also for the spectra of directed regular husimi graphs .",
    "in particular , we show that the boundary of the spectrum of directed husimi graphs composed of cycles of length @xmath0 , is determined by a hypotrochoid with radii @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the radius of the fixed circle and @xmath3 of the moving circle ) .",
    "not many analytical expressions for the spectra of directed sparse random graphs and non - hermitian random matrices are known ( besides some exceptions , see @xcite ) .",
    "a short account of some of our results on regular graphs has appeared in @xcite .",
    "networks appearing in nature are usually modelled with theoretical ensembles of graphs .",
    "these ensembles consist of randomly constructed graphs with certain topological constraints on their connectivity .",
    "model systems allow for a better understanding of the properties of the more complex real - world systems @xcite .    in this work we consider simple graphs @xmath4 of size @xmath5 consisting of a discrete set of vertices @xmath6 and a set of edges @xmath7 .",
    "simple graphs are uniquely defined by their adjacency matrix @xmath8 , with elements @xmath9_{ij } = a_{ij}\\in \\left\\{0,1\\right\\}$ ] for @xmath10 and @xmath9_{ii } = 0 $ ] for @xmath11 .",
    "we have @xmath12 when @xmath13 and zero otherwise .",
    "an undirected edge is present between @xmath14 and @xmath15 when @xmath16 , a directed edge is present from @xmath14 to @xmath15 when @xmath12 and @xmath17 , while @xmath18 indicates that there is no edge present between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we define graph ensembles through a normalized distribution @xmath19 for the adjacency matrices @xmath8 . selecting a graph from the ensemble corresponds with drawing randomly an adjacency matrix from the distribution @xmath19 .",
    "we always consider ensembles of infinite graphs , for which @xmath20 .",
    "this is implicitly assumed throughout the whole paper .",
    "below , we first define random graphs which are locally tree - like .",
    "their spectral properties have been considered in several studies @xcite .",
    "second , we define ensembles of graphs with many cycles : the cacti or husimi graphs @xcite .      ensembles of random graphs with only certain constraints on the vertex degrees are locally tree - like .",
    "some well - studied examples with these characteristics are the ensemble of @xmath21-regular graphs ( also called bethe lattices ) and the ensemble of irregular erds - rnyi graphs @xcite . for undirected graphs ,",
    "these ensembles can be formally defined as follows :    * @xmath21-regular graphs with fixed connectivity @xmath21 : @xmath22 with @xmath23 the degree of the @xmath14-th vertex .",
    "figure [ cavities1a ] presents a sketch of a bethe lattice . * erds - rnyi graphs with mean connectivity @xmath21 : @xmath24 in this ensemble",
    "the degrees fluctuate from vertex to vertex within the graph .",
    "the distribution of vertex degrees converges to a poissonian distribution with mean @xmath21 in its asymptotic limit @xmath25 .",
    "ensembles of directed graphs can be defined similarly by leaving out the symmetry constraints in the definitions eqs  ( [ eq : ensemble1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ensemble2 ] ) and by taking into consideration the difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , we define a @xmath21-regular ensemble of directed graphs by the constraint @xmath28 for any @xmath14 , with the indegree defined as @xmath29 and the outdegree as @xmath30 .",
    "the erds - rnyi and the @xmath21-regular ensemble have the local tree property , i.e.  the probability to encounter a cycle of finite length in the local neighbourhood of a vertex becomes arbitrary small for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the local tree property of random graphs is an important characteristic which has allowed to determine the spectra of sparse graphs in previous works @xcite .",
    "this property is illustrated in figure [ cavities1a ] for the bethe lattice : cycles only appear at the leaves of the tree , where the vertex constraints have to be satisfied such that their typical length is of the order @xmath32 .",
    "next , we define graph ensembles which contain many short cycles and are , therefore , not locally tree - like .",
    "a cycle of length @xmath0 is defined by a set of nodes @xmath33 with an edge connecting each pair @xmath34 , for @xmath35 .",
    "the set of all @xmath0-tuples is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "we define the following ensembles which are very similar to the husimi graphs in @xcite :    * @xmath37-regular husimi graphs with fixed connectivity @xmath21 and fixed cycle length  @xmath0 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes now the number of @xmath0-cycles of @xmath8 incident to the @xmath14-th vertex . in figure [ cavities1 ] we show the typical local neighbourhood of an undirected ( 4,2)-regular husimi graph .",

    "the first factor gives a weight @xmath43 to each randomly drawn cycle of length @xmath0 , the second factor is the constraint which makes the graph undirected and the last factor is a constraint which takes into consideration that each edge must belong to exactly one cycle of length @xmath0 .",
    "we remark that in our notation of husimi graphs the mean cycle connectivity @xmath21 is the average number of cycles of length @xmath0 connected to a certain vertex , while @xmath44 denotes the mean degree of each vertex .",
    "note that for @xmath45 the ensembles of husimi graphs introduced here reduce to the corresponding ensembles of random graphs which are locally tree - like ( discussed in the previous subsection ) .",
    "as before , we can define as well directed ensembles of husimi graphs by removing the symmetry constraint @xmath46 and taking into consideration the possible difference beween @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , for a regular husimi graph we set the mean vertex indegree and the mean vertex outdegree equal to @xmath44 . in figure [ cavities1 ] we present the neighbourhood of a vertex in a directed ( 3,2)-regular husimi graph .",
    "husimi graphs are not locally tree - like since they are composed of cycles , but they do have an infinite - dimensional character . indeed , the local neighbourhood of a vertex contains different branches which are only connected by cycles of order @xmath32 , see figures [ cavities1a ] and [ cavities1 ] .",
    "this property allows us to present an exact spectral analysis .",
    "in this section we show how to determine the spectral properties of undirected graphs with cycles . for regular graphs , our approach , briefly presented in @xcite , consists of four steps .",
    "first , we write the spectrum in statistical mechanics terms using a complex measure",
    ". then we use the infinite - dimensional nature of the graphs to derive a closed expression in the submatrices of the resolvent .",
    "next , we simplify the resolvent equations to the specific case of regular undirected husimi graphs . finally , we solve the resultant algebraic expressions to find analytical expressions for the spectra of regular husimi graphs .",
    "we define the resolvent of a real symmetric matrix @xmath8 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath49 identity matrix and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . from the resolvent",
    "we can determine the asymptotic density @xmath53 of the real eigenvalues @xmath54 of an ensemble of matrices @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath55 .",
    "\\label{eq : specres}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have left out ensemble averages since we assume that the spectrum self - averages in the limit @xmath31 to a deterministic value .",
    "a common method in statistical physics is to write the resolvent elements and the spectrum as averages over a certain complex - valued measure @xmath56 @xcite . indeed , when defining the normalized gaussian function @xmath57 the diagonal elements @xmath58_{ii } = g_{i}$ ] are given by @xcite @xmath59 with @xmath60 the average with respect to @xmath61 . in this formalism",

    "we employ the cavity method to determine the spectral properties of locally tree - like graphs @xcite .",
    "we construct a matrix @xmath65 ( and its corresponding resolvent @xmath66 ) through deletion of the @xmath14-th column and the @xmath14-th row in @xmath8 .",

    "[ app : treestruct ] we report the essential steps in deriving these resolvent equations .",

    "this forms the basis for the kikuchi approximation @xcite . for husimi graphs the kikuchi approximation gives us the resolvent equations : @xmath74 with @xmath75 and with @xmath76 the set of all @xmath77-tuples @xmath78 which form a cycle of length @xmath0 with the node @xmath14 .",
