    "having a phase transition between a low - density gas of localized doubly occupied or empty lattice sites to a high - density fluid of unbound doubly occupied or empty lattice sites is quite analogous to the well - known liquid - gas transition which lies also in the ising universality class .",

    "a description in terms of critical exponents is not sufficient unless the pressure is tuned to its critical value . instead",
    ", the usage of a scaling theory was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "while such an approach is extremely general and can be applied to any universality class , it was shown in ref.@xcite that the expansivity data of ref.@xcite is in fact consistent with 2d ising criticality : within the scenario of two - parameter scaling , the gibbs free energy can be written as @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is a universal scaling function which only depends on the universality class , @xmath3 and @xmath53 are the two ( suitably normalized ) scaling variables , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are their corresponding rg eigenvalues .",
    "these are the two relevant eigenvalues of the underlying universality class and determine all critical exponents .",
    "for example , @xmath56 or @xmath57 ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) . conventionally , @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be thought of as temperature- and pressure - like quantities , but more generally there are also linear mixing terms such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in fact , very close to the transition hooke s law of elasticity breaks down and one should expect compressive strain to enter linearly the scaling variables instead of pressure , see below and ref.@xcite .",
    "the appearance of the mixing terms is a consequence of the experimental fact that the first - order transition line ending in the critical point @xmath62 is not parallel to the @xmath14 axis , see fig.[schematic - pd ] .",
    "while the linear mixing terms turn out to be important for a quantitative description of the expansivity data @xcite , let us for simplicity focus here on the much simpler case of no mixing . for the @xmath63 ising universality class , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "having one integer - valued rg eigenvalue , logarithmic corrections to scaling should be expected @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the scaling ansatz for the @xmath63 ising universality class requires a correction term and reads @xcite @xmath66 differentiating twice with respect to @xmath3 and setting @xmath53 equal to zero one then obtains the well - known logarithmic divergence of the specific heat @xmath67 . assuming no mixing terms , the singular part of the thermal expansivity is given by @xcite @xmath68 as a consequence , the grneisen ratio @xmath69 diverges for @xmath70 as @xcite @xmath71",
    "let to emphasize here that the true divergence of the grneisen parameter is a consequence of neglecting linear mixing terms .",
    "including such mixing terms effectively leads to a saturation of the grneisen parameter at a very large value .",
    "it was estimated in ref.@xcite that the crossover scale for the d8-br crystals is of order 0.1bar and thus for most practical purposes beyond experimental resolution .",
    "the smallness of this crossover scale can be related via the clausius - clapeyron equation to comparatively small entropy differences between the metallic and insulating phases .",
    "the grneisen ratio is also known to diverge at a quantum critical point @xcite .    in the case",
    "@xmath72 there is no divergence in the specific heat , implying that the specific heat is bounded and can safely be replaced by a constant .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the universality class of unconventional criticality for which @xmath73 and @xmath31 . in this case both the expansivity and the specific heat",
    "stay finite such that there is no divergence of the grneisen ratio .",
    "still , there is no reason to expect the expansivity to be proportional to the specific heat , i.e.  grneisen scaling breaks down.@xcite    to describe the expansivity of the @xmath0-et salts away but close to criticality , i.e.  for @xmath74 , we can express the singular part of the expansivity in terms of derivatives of the scaling function @xmath52 .",
    "differentiating eq.([eq : fising ] ) with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath53 , one obtains @xcite @xmath75 with the scaling function @xmath76 given by @xmath77 even though the 2d ising model can be solved exactly , there is no known exact expression for the scaling function @xmath52 and hence no exact expression for @xmath76 .",

    "however , at first glance , the present thermal expansion findings appear to fit in the model proposed by lee _",
    "@xcite , which we described briefly at the end of the introduction .",
    "according to this model , spin pairing on the fermi surface generates a spontaneous breaking of the lattice symmetry , giving rise to a phase transition at finite temperature , which in turn is coupled to a lattice distortion . in other words , upon cooling , the spin entropy has to be ( partially ) frozen . the only way for this , without long - range magnetic ordering , is to introduce a lattice distortion .",
    "this process presents some similarities with a classical spin - peierls transition , where the formation of a singlet state requires that the spin entropy of the triplet state goes to zero by introducing a lattice distortion . in the present case , the amount of entropy in the temperature range 0.3k @xmath111 @xmath14 @xmath111 1.5k corresponds to only a few percent of @xmath112ln2 @xcite , indicating therefore that only a minor part of the total number of spins contribute to the spin - liquid phase .",
    "interestingly enough , the shape of the transition at 6k ( fig.[te - spinliquidlowt ] ) resembles the shape of the anomaly in the thermal expansion coefficient associated with the spin - peierls transition for the quasi-1d organic conductors ( tmttf)@xmath1x ( x = pf@xmath113 and asf@xmath113 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the sharp lattice distortion at @xmath105 @xmath7 6k seems to be associated with a real phase transition and not with a crossover , as proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , thermal expansion measurements along the second in - plane _ b_-axis revealed striking anisotropic in - plane lattice effects @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , along the in - plane _ b_-axis ( see fig.[te - spinliquidlowt ] ) a negative anomaly is observed at @xmath105 @xmath7 6k , indicating that below @xmath105 a lattice expansion ( shrinkage ) along the _ c_-axis ( _ b_-axis ) occurs .",
    "the observed distinct in - plane anisotropy implies that the hopping integral terms @xmath3 and @xmath21 are strongly affected .",
    "it remains to be seen whether @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath11 is in fact in a spin - liquid state for @xmath114 . in this sense , thermal expansion measurements at very low temperatures along the _",
    "a_- , _ b_- and _ c_-axes are required in order to achieve a better understanding of the physics of this exciting material .",
    "such experiments will reveal , for example , whether below 1.3k @xmath15/@xmath14 behaves linearly and remains finite as @xmath14 @xmath115 0 , as observed in specific heat measurements @xcite or if @xmath15/@xmath14 decreases exponentially . as already mentioned at the end of the introduction , it was more recently reported @xcite that the thermal conductivity of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath11 is described by an activated behavior with a gap @xmath116 @xmath7 0.46k .",
    "the latter results are at odds with the specific heat measurements performed by s.  yamashita _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . based on such results",
    ", one can see that a full picture of the fundamental aspects of the spin - liquid phase in @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath11 is still incomplete and requires further investigations .",
    "in this review , we have addressed one of the central questions in the field of strongly correlated electron systems , whether lattice degrees of freedom play a role for several physical phenomena , among them the mott mi transition . of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x family",
    "have been revealed as model systems for the study of the latter phenomena .",
    "the main findings discussed in this review are summarized below .    at the mott metal - to - insulator transition temperature @xmath117 = 13.6k , accompanied by a striking anisotropy . while huge effects are observed along the in - plane _",
    "a_-axis , along which the polymeric anion chains are aligned , an almost zero effect is observed along the second in - plane _",
    "c_-axis , along which the polymeric anion chains are linked via br - n weak contacts .",
    "still more amazing is the observation of pronounced lattice effects along the out - of - plane _ b_-axis .",
    "these findings provide strong evidence that the mott transition for the present class of materials can not be fully understood in the frame of a purely 2d electronic triangular dimer model .",
    "even though there is still an ongoing debate about the universality class and possible crossover scales of the mott transition , the scaling theory reviewed here can be used with any universality class .",
    "candidates suggested for the mott transition in the @xmath0-et salts are unconventional criticality @xcite , 2d ising @xcite , and a crossover to landau criticality @xcite .",
    "it was explicitly shown that the thermal expansivity data for the @xmath0-d8-br salt is consistent with 2d ising criticality @xcite , which of course does not provide a proof of this universality class .",
    "finally , the experimentally observed critical exponent @xmath33 was also argued to be due to subleading quantum effects preceding an asymptotic critical regime @xcite .    in order to achieve a better understanding of the mott transition in the present material , thermal expansion measurements",
    "were taken under although by means of thermal expansion measurements one has access to the macroscopic behavior of the sample studied , the strong anisotropic lattice effects observed , marked by a negative thermal expansion above @xmath6 , enable us to draw some conclusions at the microscopic level .",
    "hence , a model within the rigid - unit - mode scenario , taking into account the low - energy vibration modes of the cyanide ligands of the polymeric anions cu[n(cn)@xmath20]br@xmath25 , was proposed to describe the negative thermal expansion above the @xmath6 @xmath7 77k . in this model ,",
    "low - energy vibration modes of the cyanide groups of the polymeric anion chains become frozen upon cooling down to @xmath6 , shrinking thus the _ a _ lattice parameter upon warming the system above @xmath6 .",
    "we have here presented a phenomenological description of the mott metal - insulator transition within a scaling theory .",
    "while transport measurements revealed unconventional critical exponents , it would be desirable to have direct access to thermodynamic quantities .",
    "in particular , we hope that future expansivity measurements under pressure might give rise to a better understanding .",
    "we have also examined in this review thermal expansion measurements on the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath119cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath23 salt , a system which is as a candidate for the realization of a spin - liquid ground state .",
    "measurements taken along the in - plane _",
    "c_-axis reveal some interesting aspects , which can be of extreme importance for a wider understanding of the physical properties of this material .",
    "for example , the absence of the so - called glass - like transition in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath119cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath23 is in line with the above - mentioned model within the rigid - unit modes scenario .",
    "while the anion cu[n(cn)@xmath20]br@xmath25 is arranged in form of chains weakly linked via br - n contacts , the anions cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath100 are arranged in a 2d network fashion , so that the cyanide groups are confined between the cu atoms and therefore the vibration modes associated with the cyanide groups can not propagate along the structure as it occurs , for example , in fully deuterated salts of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath119cu[n(cn)@xmath20]br , cf.the discussion above .",
    "a negative thermal expansion is observed 14 @xmath111 @xmath14 @xmath111 50k .",
    "in addition , the thermal expansion coefficient reveals a huge anomaly , indicative of a phase transition at @xmath14 = 6k , coinciding nicely with a hump in the specific heat , which has been assigned to a crossover to the quantum spin - liquid state .",
    "last but not least , during the preparation of the final version of this article , a theoretical treatment for the thermal expansivity of the charge - transfer salts of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath119x family based on electronic correlations was proposed by kokalj and mckenzie @xcite .",
    "these authors consider both the dependence of the system entropy on the hubbard parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath21 and the dependence with temperature of the double occupancy and bond - orders to describe the thermal expansion of these materials .",
