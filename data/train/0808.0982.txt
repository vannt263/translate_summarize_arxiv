    "the aim of this work is to identify new @xmath0-discrete painlev equations .",
    "what exactly are the discrete painlev equations ( d - p ) ? one could state that a d - p is a second - order , nonautonomous integrable mapping having one of the celebrated painlev equations for a continuous limit .",
    "this description does not quite capture the whole story , so let s look at some important notions about discrete painlev equations .",
    "although some discrete painlev equations were found _ avant la lettre _ , the first steps were made by brzin and kazakov @xcite who found an equation ( now known as d - p@xmath3 ) and computed its continuous limit , the continuous painlev i. the definition of _ singularity confinement _",
    "@xcite was maybe the most important step in the evolution of the field : it is the discrete analogue of the painlev property and describes the behaviour of singularities throughout the evolution of a discrete equation :    consider a difference equation with independent variable @xmath4 and dependent variable @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is such that it gives rise to a singularity for @xmath6 , then there exists a @xmath7 such that the singularity is confined to @xmath8 and @xmath9 depends only on @xmath10    using only this criterion of singularity confinement , discrete analogues for ( continuous ) p@xmath11 , p@xmath12 and p@xmath13 were identified @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it s striking that in the analogue of p@xmath14 we see the independent variable @xmath4 entering the equation only in an exponential way : @xmath15 with @xmath16 constants .",
    "therefore , it is considered to be a so - called _",
    "@xmath0-discrete _ equation as the nature of the equation is multiplicative rather than additive like , e.g. , d - p@xmath17 @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath16 constants .",
    "this equation shows an odd - even dependence through the factor @xmath20 when @xmath21 . in this case",
    "we can introduce new variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 that lead to the system @xmath24 with @xmath25",
    ". this system is known as @xmath26d - p@xmath3 , an _",
    "asymmetric _ discrete painlev equation .",
    "a list of a few important discrete painlev equations was compiled by peter clarkson , and can be found in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for an overview of discrete painlev equations .",
    "the link between orthonormal polynomials and discrete painlev equations is well established ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . given a positive measure @xmath27 on a set @xmath28 and assuming all the moments for @xmath27 exist , i.e. @xmath29 , we denote with @xmath30 the set of orthonormal polynomials with respect to @xmath27 : @xmath31 these orthonormal polynomials are unique if we choose the leading coefficient to be positive .",
    "orthonormal polynomials satisfy a three - term recurrence relation of the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 . here",

    "@xmath35 as the coefficients showing up in the fourier expansion of @xmath36 : @xmath37    if we write @xmath38 , we can find @xmath39 by comparing the leading coefficients of both sides of the recurrence relation . since we chose to take positive leading coefficients",
    ", @xmath34 will be positive as well .    during the last few decades ,",
    "many generalizations of well - known weight functions have been shown to give rise to discrete painlev equations for the recurrence coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    as far as we can see , the very first appearance of a d - p was in the context of orthogonal polynomials , when shohat @xcite found a nonlinear recurrence relation for the recurrence coefficients , which is now known as d - p@xmath3 .",
    "fokas , its and kitaev found the connection of d - p@xmath40 to freud weights in @xcite .",
    "nijhoff @xcite found a @xmath0-discrete painlev equation in the context of orthogonal polynomials : he considered a @xmath0-generalization of the hermite polynomials on the exponential lattice and found non - linear recurrences of order @xmath412 .",
    "a second order recurrence relation was found by the third author @xcite which he called q - p@xmath40 .",
    "we will study a slight extension of this freud weight to recover asymmetric @xmath0-painlev equations .",
    "in particular we consider in section 3 the weight @xmath42 on the @xmath0-exponential lattice @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "we will show that @xmath45 and @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 which we will call q - p@xmath48 .",
    "the case @xmath49 was already obtained in @xcite . in section 4",
    "we consider the more general weight @xmath50 we show that @xmath51 now satisfies @xmath52 in section 5 we relate these equations to @xmath1-@xmath0-p@xmath13 . in section 6 we show a stable method of computing the recurrence coefficients .",
    "we consider orthogonal polynomials on the exponential lattice @xmath53 the orthonormality condition with respect to a weight @xmath27 on @xmath54 is , @xmath55 the @xmath0-integral is defined as the sum @xmath56 the @xmath0-difference operator @xmath57 will play an important role in our results : @xmath58 we will consider even weights @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that the orthonormal polynomials @xmath60 associated with the weight @xmath27 will satisfy the symmetry property @xmath61 the orthonormal polynomials of even degree will be even , those of odd degree will be odd .",
    "the recurrence relation will then take the form @xmath62 i.e. , all coefficients @xmath35 are equal to zero .",
    "+ we will use the following technique ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to identify @xmath0-discrete painlev equations :    * given an even weight @xmath27 , let @xmath60 denote the orthonormal polynomials with respect to @xmath27 . *",
    "find the fourier expansion of the polynomial @xmath63 .",
    "* compare the coefficients of this polynomial and its fourier expansion .",

    "this limit relation is the only reason for the presence of the ( constant ) denominator in @xmath27 .",
    "so this weight can be called a @xmath0-analogue of the modified freud weight @xmath72 .",
    "it is easy to check that this weight satisfies the pearson equation @xmath73 let @xmath60 be the orthonormal polynomials associated to @xmath27 as in . because of we can put @xmath74 , and we have the following    [ lemma : gammaquotienten]for orthogonal polynomials with an even weight one has @xmath75    these two equations can be obtained by comparing , respectively , the @xmath76 and @xmath77 terms in the recurrence relation .",

    "the resulting painlev equations for even and odd @xmath4 will have a very similar structure .",

    "now we perform a shift in the summation index of the first sum , so that it contains the expression @xmath90 , and we apply the pearson equation on this . we can recognize all sums as @xmath0-integrals , and we obtain @xmath91 from now on we have to make a distinction based on the parity of @xmath4 . +",
    "since @xmath88 is odd , we know from that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are odd polynomials , hence @xmath94 and @xmath95 are polynomials , and the orthogonality relations imply that the first and the third integral in vanish . to obtain the value of the second integral ,",
    "we write @xmath96 as a linear combination of the orthonormal polynomials @xmath97 : an easy calculation shows that @xmath98 using lemma  [ lemma : gammaquotienten ] and the orthonormality relations we obtain - .",
    "+ the second integral in can be computed in exactly the same way as in the previous case . however , this time the contributions of the first and the third integral do not vanish . for the third integral , we need to write @xmath99 as a linear combination of the orthonormal polynomials @xmath97 .",
    "this can be done because @xmath4 is odd , and hence @xmath60 is an odd polynomial .",
    "this yields @xmath100 as for the first integral in , we can use the orthogonality relations to write @xmath101 which is the same as the third integral in . combining these results with lemma  [ lemma : gammaquotienten ]",
    "we obtain - .",

    "comparing coefficients of @xmath77 and @xmath102 in these structure relations and using lemma  [ lemma : gammaquotienten ] gives @xmath103 and @xmath104 for even @xmath4 , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 for odd @xmath4 .",
    "the aim is to obtain a painlev - type recurrence relation between @xmath107 , @xmath34 and @xmath108 .",
    "hence to get rid of the @xmath109 in and , we replace @xmath4 by @xmath110 .",
    "keep in mind that this changes the parity of @xmath4 .",
    "the sum @xmath111 that arises in this way , should then be seen as @xmath112 , where we can use and respectively to write these sums as a function of @xmath107 , @xmath34 and @xmath108 only .",
    "these manipulations yield the following recurrence relations:@xmath113this is a @xmath0-deformation of the discrete painlev i equation @xmath114-@xmath115 , which in its most general form is given by @xmath116 indeed , if we take @xmath117 and we let @xmath0 tend to 1 , we get @xmath118 putting @xmath51 , we can factorize the equations : we obtain @xmath119 if we write @xmath120 and @xmath121 , substituting @xmath4 by @xmath122 resp .",
    "@xmath123 in , we get @xmath124 this set of equations could therefore be called a set of asymmetric @xmath0-discrete painlev i equations ( @xmath1-q - p@xmath40 ) . however , in the next section we will obtain a more general form of it .",
    "concerning the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath34 as @xmath4 tends to infinity ( with fixed @xmath0 ) , it follows easily from that @xmath34 tends to 0 , and that @xmath125 or , equivalently , @xmath126the set of equations has the singularity confinement property : if @xmath127 , then a singularity occurs for @xmath128 but this singularity does not propagate infinitely : e.g. for @xmath4 even , putting @xmath129 we obtain @xmath130 so the singularity is confined to @xmath131 ; furthermore @xmath132 depends on the value @xmath133 before the singularity .",
    "the same holds for odd @xmath4 : @xmath134 there are two ( one for each parity ) more critical cases that might give rise to singularities , namely when @xmath135 . running the singularity analysis gives , for even @xmath4 , @xmath136 the coefficient of @xmath137 however , is @xmath138 itself as @xmath133 satisfies @xmath139 or , after substituing @xmath140 , @xmath141 so there is no singularity to confine . one could hope to use the recurrence relations ( [ eq : painleve_y_evenodd ] ) to compute the recurrence coefficients .",
    "given @xmath142 , it would be nice to show that there is a unique solution to which is positive for all @xmath143 .",
    "the existence of such a solution is clear since @xmath144 satisfies the given recurrence relations and is obviously positive for @xmath143 .",
    "its uniqueness however can only be expected based on numerical experiments , but we have no proof of it yet .",
    "the method used in section  [ section : stable ] is probably the key to proving this uniqueness . using and the @xmath0-binomial theorem ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath145 the knowledge of @xmath146 and @xmath147 and the recurrence relation allow us to compute the @xmath140 recursively .",
    "however , this turns out to be an unstable method .",
    "we computed @xmath140 to a certain accuracy for some particular choices of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ fig ] we plotted the values of @xmath148 , calculated with an accuracy of 200 digits , with parameters @xmath149 . for this choice of parameters , the computed values seem to satisfy the limit behaviour as stated in up to @xmath150 , but for larger @xmath4 the sensibility of the non - linear equations on the initial values destroys this behaviour .",
    "this is why section  [ section : stable ] will be devoted to a more stable way of computing the recurrence coefficients .     from with @xmath151 , @xmath152 , with an accuracy of 200 digits .",
    "the odd - even dependence is clearly visible.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this section we consider a generalization of the previous case : let the weight be given by @xmath153 with @xmath154 . this weight satisfies the pearson equation @xmath155 if @xmath156 then @xmath157{1-q^4}x\\right)\\rightarrow|x|^\\alpha e^{-x^4 - 2ax^2}\\qquad { \\rm as } \\ : q\\rightarrow 1,\\ ] ] so this weight is a @xmath0-analogue of the freud weight @xmath158 .",
    "obviously the choice @xmath159 gives us the case considered in the previous section .",
    "the choice @xmath160 leaves us with a @xmath0-analogue of the weight @xmath161 , which was already studied in @xcite in the case @xmath162 .",
    "[ lemma : c : structure_relation]for even @xmath4 , the orhogonal polynomials @xmath60 for the weight @xmath27 in satisfy the following structure relation : @xmath163 with @xmath164 @xmath165 for odd @xmath4 , the polynomials @xmath60 satisfy @xmath166 with @xmath167 @xmath168    the proof follows the same steps as the proof of lemma  [ lemma : structure_relation ] .",
    "the only difference is that in the pearson equation , the quartic polynomial @xmath169 has now got to be replaced by @xmath170 .",
    "performing the same manipulations as in the previous section leads us to a recurrence relation satisfied by the @xmath34 : @xmath171 putting again @xmath51 we obtain a @xmath0-discrete painlev i equation , of which is a special case : @xmath172 we can rewrite these equations into a more familiar form for asymmetric discrete painlev equations : denoting @xmath173 and @xmath174 we get @xmath175 besides @xmath0 , this set of equations contains the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath176 , and it is the most general form of the asymmetric @xmath0-discrete painlev i equations we obtain .",

    ". it is interesting to notice that these modifications w.r.t .",
    "the previous section survive in the limit case @xmath177 : if we put @xmath178 and we let @xmath0 tend to 1 , we obtain @xmath179 which is still an instance of the discrete painlev i equation . here",
    "@xmath180 and @xmath176 are related as in .",
    "the introduction of the additional parameter @xmath176 has no influence on the limit behaviour of the recurrence coefficients @xmath34 : still holds . to show this we distinguish the following cases .",
    "we only mention the proof for even @xmath4 , the odd @xmath4 case being analogous .    *",
    "@xmath159 is the case from the previous section . *",
    "@xmath181 : for even @xmath4 , gives @xmath182 so @xmath183 and @xmath184 is bounded .",
    "denoting @xmath185 , gives the quadratic equation @xmath186 .",
    "this equation has a negative solution @xmath187 which we can reject , and a positive solution @xmath188 .",

    "@xmath160 : then the result follows immediately from .",
    "once more , the singularity confinement property is fulfilled : taking @xmath129 for an even @xmath4 , one finds that @xmath128 and @xmath196 are @xmath197 , @xmath198 is @xmath138 and @xmath199+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\epsilon).\\ ] ] now it is not obvious that the constant term is nonzero : if @xmath200 then this is not yet a proof that the singularity confinement property holds . for odd",
    "@xmath4 a similar argument yields @xmath201+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\epsilon)\\ ] ] and a problem could arise if @xmath202 .",
    "however ( consider the case @xmath4 is even , the odd @xmath4 case being completely analogous ) the zero at @xmath132 gives rise to singularities in @xmath203 , but the singularity vanishes in @xmath204 .",
    "moreover , for the same reasons as above , this @xmath204 can only be zero if @xmath205 ( which is nonzero since @xmath206 and @xmath207 , the case @xmath159 being considered in the previous section ) , while the computation gave @xmath208 .",
    "so this assures us that even in the worst case , the singularity is confined to @xmath209 . again , as in section  [ section : nog_geen_c ] , there are no singularities arising from @xmath210 due to fine cancellations .",
    "+ concerning the use of the recurrence relations to compute the recurrence coefficients @xmath34 of the orthogonal polynomials , we now start with @xmath142 and @xmath211 the same remark as in the previous section holds : this method is unstable , as is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we refer to section  [ section : stable ] for a stable computation method .     from with @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , with an accuracy of 200 digits.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we restricted ourselves to the choice @xmath215 , with the case @xmath160 being a limiting case where the painlev equations give explicit expressions for e.g. @xmath140 .",
    "however , numerical experiments strongly suggest that also for @xmath216 ( in which case the weight @xmath217 is still positive on @xmath218 $ ] ) , the results on the limit behaviour still hold , and the singularity confinement property is still valid as well . even for @xmath219 , where for small @xmath4 we observe that @xmath140 can be negative",
    ", we still observe that @xmath140 is bounded and oscillating , however the even and odd subsequences do not tend to @xmath220 and 1 respectively anymore , but to @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing that the obtained recurrence relations can be seen as a limiting case of the set of asymmetric discrete painlev equations @xmath1-q - p@xmath223 .",
    "this set can be found as the discrete painlev equation connected to the affine weyl group @xmath224 in sakai s classification(see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or as @xmath1-q - p@xmath223 in @xcite .",
    "the equations are @xmath225 @xmath226 with @xmath227 .",
    "consider this system with the particular choice of parameters @xmath228 then , letting @xmath229 tend to 0 , we obtain as a limit the set of equations .",
    "a more stable way for computing the recurrence values is by writing as a system of quadratic equations in @xmath230 and @xmath231 , in the same way as we obtained : @xmath232 computing the discriminants and opting for their positive roots ( as we know , the @xmath233 and @xmath234 are related to the recurrence coefficients which are positive ) in the expression of @xmath233 and @xmath234 , we find @xmath235 with @xmath236 we now define an operator @xmath237 , acting on the space of double non - negative rows : @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 the solution of the equation which comes from our recurrence coefficients , denoted by @xmath241 , now coincides with a fixed point of this operator @xmath237 . we know that @xmath242 ( inequalities should be interpreted termwise : as holding between any two elements on corresponding positions ) . unleashing",
    "the operator @xmath237 ( on any inequality we will use ) reverses inequalities .    if @xmath243 , then @xmath244 .",
    "it is not hard to check that all partial derivatives of @xmath245 and @xmath246 are negative in the region where we need them .",
    "which region this is , depends on the parameter @xmath176 .",
    "we now construct the following sequence by repeatedly applying @xmath237 to @xmath247 .",
    "this sequence has increasing subsequence @xmath248 and decreasing subsequence @xmath249 .",
    "we denote their limits by @xmath250 and @xmath251 , respectively . by continuity of @xmath237",
    "we get that @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "furthermore , any fixed point @xmath254 with positive components has to obey @xmath255 .",
    "if one is able to show that @xmath256 , one proves there is only one fixed point , which necessarily coincides with the solution of the discrete painlev equation coming from the recurrence coefficients .",
    "we did not find this proof ( yet ) , but numerical experiments strongly suggest that indeed @xmath257 .",
    "this would also be enough to prove the uniqueness of positive solutions to or with @xmath142 , as mentioned in section  [ section : nog_geen_c ] .",
