    "manufacturing arrays of three dimensional nanoscale islands is a field of intense research , with many potential optoelectronic applications ( quantum dots ) @xcite .",
    "the production of these structure represents a difficult challenge .",
    "one possible way to proceed is by spontaneous formation @xcite of coherent ( i.e.  dislocation free ) strained islands in heteroepitaxy : this approach represents an elegant and simple way to produce quantum dots . for instance , when growing a layer of ingaas on gaas(001 ) @xcite or of sige on si(001 ) @xcite , spontaneous formation of three dimensional coherent islands is observed after depositing a few layers .",
    "however , our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to island formation from strained layers is still incomplete , and even the equilibrium properties of such structures are not well understood @xcite .",
    "a flat strained layer is _ unstable _ @xcite against island formation .",
    "the driving force of this instability is the elastic energy gain due to the relaxation of the stress at the top of the islands . basically , the elastic energy gain for the creation of islands is proportional to the volume @xmath0 of the islands ( per unit area of an island ) .",
    "the surface energy loss , on the other hand , scales with the volume as @xmath1 .",
    "hence it is clear that , above some critical volume , the growth of the island will be energetically favored . in this simple description ,",
    "the equilibrium state of the system consists in a single very big island .",
    "experiments , however , reveal a different behavior . regularly spaced islands with a narrow size distribution @xcite are observed on the substrate , sometimes above a thin wetting layer . to explain the difference between the simple argument and the observations , several authors have suggested that the density of islands is fixed by the kinetics of the growth process @xcite . however , some systems of islands are not affected by reasonable annealing @xcite .",
    "either the driving force becomes very small so that the system never reaches its equilibrium state , or there is a stable or a metastable state corresponding to a given island density .",
    "indeed , shchukin et al .",
    "@xcite have argued that coherent arrays of tridimensional islands may be thermodynamically stable , when taking into account elastic energy , facets energy , surface stress and the contribution of the edges .    in this paper",
    ", we study the equilibrium properties of a bidimensional strained layer . our aim is to gain an understanding of the structure by using a minimal model , with the simplest possible ingredients . to describe the energetics of the layer",
    ", we only take into account surface energies , interactions between islands , and the elastic energy of the substrate and the strained layer .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that the islands grow on a wetted surface so that our analysis is also relevant to the stranski - krastanov growth mode .",
    "some of the terms that contribute to the energy can not be computed analytically , or only with uncontrolled approximations .",
    "when this is the case , we use simulation of a simple model ( lennard - jones interactions ) to investigate the approximations done in the analytical calculation .    minimizing the total energy of an array of islands , we find that , using only these simple ingredients , stable arrays of islands are predicted in a range of parameter values . the size and density of the islands at equilibrium and the height of the wetting layer are also obtained .    in the first part of the paper ,",
    "we define the system we study , and the model used in the simulations . in the second part",
    ", we will precisely review all the terms that enter the energy calculation .",

    "the distance between the islands is @xmath9 .",

    "these studies show that the shape factor depends essentially of the aspect ratio @xmath18 of the island , and only weakly of the ratios between elastic constants .",

    "@xcite shows that `` huts '' of germanium on silicon(001 ) disappear during the growth and simultaneously `` domes '' appear .",

    "it is interesting that nontrivial stable configurations are nevertheless obtained , showing that surface stress is not an essential ingredient in island formation .",

    "<S> we investigate the equilibrium properties of arrays of coherent strained islands in heteroepitaxial thin films of bidimensional materials . </S>",
    "<S> the model we use takes into account only three essential ingredients : surface energies , elastic energies of the film and of the substrate and interaction energies between islands via the substrate . using numerical simulations for a simple lennard - jones solid </S>",
    "<S> , we can assess the validity of the analytical expressions used to describe each of these contributions . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analytical expression is obtained for the total energy of the system . minimizing this energy , </S>",
    "<S> we show that arrays of coherent islands can exist as stable configurations . even in this simple approach </S>",
    "<S> , the quantitative results turn out to be very sensitive to some details of the surface energy .    </S>",
