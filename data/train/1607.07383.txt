    "to play billiards in a euclidean polygon , the rules are as follows : an infinitesimal ball travels along a straight line ( geodesic ) at constant speed , and when it hits a side of the polygon then it changes its direction so the angle of incidence agrees with the angle of reflection .",
    "the path followed by such a ball is called a _",
    "billiard trajectory_.    it also makes sense to play billiards in a hyperbolic polygon , as here we also have well - defined meanings of geodesics and angles of incidence and reflection . to our knowledge , the first instance where such a dynamical system was considered is in an article by e. artin @xcite written in german ( see @xcite for an english translation ) . using continued fractions , he constructs dense bi - infinite billiard trajectories in half of the fundamental polygon of the modular surface .",
    "in fact , there are many striking connections between geodesics on the modular surface , their symbolic coding via cutting sequences and number theory such as binary quadratic forms and continued fractions ( see @xcite for a well known classical reference and also , e.g. , @xcite for very recent developments ) .     which are cyclically related to @xmath0 .",
    "their billiard sequences are @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : cycrelillus],width=415 ]    a billiard trajectory is said to be _ closed _ if after a finite time it returns to the same point with the same direction .",
    "a natural setting is to consider closed billiard trajectories in ideal hyperbolic polygons where all vertices lie on the boundary at infinity .",
    "a key piece of information of a billiard trajectory in such an ideal hyperbolic polygon is its _ billiard sequence _ obtained by recording the order of the sides where the ball hits the boundary . unlike the euclidean case , where there may be uncountably many closed billiard trajectories , although they are homotopic , with the same billiard sequence , in the hyperbolic case there is at most one ( which is a consequence of the fact that the curvature is strictly negative ) . in a polygon with @xmath4-sides , there are @xmath4 different _ anti - clockwise enumerations _ of the polygon s sides with labels @xmath5 . for each such labelling of the polygon ,",
    "a closed billiard trajectory @xmath6 gives rise to a finite sequence of these numbers , which we call the billiard sequence of @xmath6 with respect to this labelling .",
    "two billiard trajectories in a given ideal polygon are said to be _ cyclically related _ if , under different anti - clockwise enumerations of the polygon s sides , they yield the same billiard sequences .",
    "figure [ fig : cycrelillus ] illustrates this concept : our hyperbolic polygon there is an ideal quadrilateral in the poincar unit disc @xmath7 and the original closed billiard trajectory has the finite billiard sequence @xmath0 .",
    "a closed billiard trajectory has a well - defined _ hyperbolic length_. given two different ideal hyperbolic @xmath4-gons with anti - clockwise labellings of their sides , we can compare billiard trajectories in both polygons with the same billiard sequences . for closed billiard trajectories with a given billiard sequence , it is interesting to ask for which polygons this length is minimised .",
    "a first conjecture may be that the minimising polygon is the regular polygon , i.e. , the polygon whose symmetry group is the full dihedral group .",
    "however , it is easy to see that this is actually not the case .",
    "indeed , there are many billiard sequences for which we can find polygons whose corresponding trajectories have arbitrary small lengths . therefore , we consider _ families of all cyclically related _ closed billiard trajectories in a polygon and their averaged lengths . a conjecture in @xcite states for _ ideal _ hyperbolic polygons that the _ average length function _ of any family of cyclically related closed billiard trajectories is uniquely minimised by the regular polygon .",
    "note that in a regular polygon , cyclically related billiard trajectories are just rotations of each other about the centre of the polygon and that all of them have the same length .",
    "the aim of this paper is to confirm this conjecture , that is , to prove the following result :    [ thm : main ] in anti - clockwise labelled ideal hyperbolic polygons with @xmath8 sides , the _ average length function _ of any family of cyclically related closed billiard trajectories corresponding to a given billiard sequence is uniquely minimised by the regular polygon .",
    "let us roughly outline the strategy of proof : firstly , we associate to every polygon a hyperbolic surface by gluing two oppositely oriented copies of the polygon pointwise along corresponding sides .",
    "note that the surface is noncompact and has @xmath4 cusps .",
    "we refer to this surface as a _ billiard surface_. then every even - sided closed billiard trajectory in the polygon lifts to a pair of closed geodesics of the same length in the corresponding surface and every odd - sided closed billiard trajectory lifts to one closed geodesic in the surface of twice the length of the original billiard trajectory . in short , billiard trajectories in the polygon",
    "correspond to geodesics in the billiard surface .",
    "this allows us to rephrase the conjecture as a result on the length of closed geodesics in billiard surfaces .",
    "in order to apply powerful results of teichmller theory and the _ weil - petersson metric _ , we consider the billiard surfaces as points in _ teichmller space _ and we call the subspace of all billiard surfaces the _ billiard space_. specifically , we use the results of wolpert that geodesic length functions are strictly convex with respect to the weil - petersson metric of teichmller space , and of kerckhoff that summed length functions of filling curves are proper .    introducing a weil - petersson isometry of teichmller space ( the so called _ flip map _ ) which fixes the billiard space pointwise , we show that the billiard space is a geodesically convex subset of teichmller space with respect to the weil - petersson metric .",
    "the average length function of a family of cyclically related closed billiard trajectories corresponds to a geodesic length function of a filling family of closed curves in teichmller space . by the above mentioned results",
    ", the geodesic length function becomes minimal in a unique point in teichmller space and it only remains to show that this minimising point in teichmller space corresponds to the billiard surface associated to the regular polygon .    the following five sections of this paper follow essentially the arguments of proof described above . in appendix",
    "a , we briefly discuss an analogous problem in the euclidean setting : here the polygons are rectangles of area one and the unique minimizing billiard table turns out to be the unit square .",
    "* acknowledgement : * the authors gratefully acknowledge the inspiring and helpful discussions with andreas knauf and joan porti concerning the strategy of proof .",
    "they also thank andy hayden for numerous general detailled discussions concerning the topic and many aspects of the proof .",
    "np greatly enjoyed the hospitality of the tu dortmund and the isaac newton institute , cambridge , while he was working on certain parts of this article .",
    "in this section , we prove a particular property of the connected components of the complement of a union of all rotations of a closed billiard trajectory in a regular hyperbolic polygon .",
    "let us first introduce this property for families of curves , which is called _ filling _ , in full detail .",
    "this definition for polygons is guided by the desire that the lift of a family of filling curves in the corresponding billiard surface ( which will be introduced later ) is also filling .",
    "note that , for finite volume riemann surfaces , a family of curves is called filling if each connected component of their complement is an open topological disc or a disc with one puncture corresponding to one of the cusps of the surface . since the main result of this section ( proposition [ prop - fill ] below ) holds both for compact and ideal regular polygons ,",
    "we formulate it in this generality .",
    "let us first introduce some basic notation .",
    "[ dfn : hyppoly ] let @xmath9 be a ( closed ) hyperbolic @xmath4-gon .",

    "let @xmath12 $ ] denote the ( geodesic ) side of @xmath9 with endpoints @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where indices are taken modulo @xmath4 .",
    "we use the convention that each side contains both its endpoints .    henceforth , we only consider hyperbolic polygons @xmath15 with interior angles equal to the fixed value @xmath16 ( compact case ) or @xmath17 ( ideal case ) .",
    "such a polygon gives rise to a tessellation of @xmath7 via repeated reflections and to a natural projection map from @xmath7 to @xmath9 .",
    "then the projection of every oriented bi - infinite geodesic in @xmath7 can be viewed as a billiard trajectory in @xmath9 , as long as the geodesic in @xmath7 is not completely contained in the union of the boundaries of the tiles in this tessellation .",
    "conversely , given a billiard trajectory in @xmath9 with a start point , it can be _ unfolded _ to a bi - infinite geodesic in @xmath7 by reflecting the billiard table along its sides instead of the trajectory , whenever it hits the boundary .",
    "note that this viewpoint allows us to define billiard trajectories of @xmath9 even in the case when they hit the vertices @xmath13 of @xmath9 .",
    "we also like to mention for the sake of simplicity that , if there is no danger of misinterpretation , we often do not distinguish between billiard trajectories and geodesics given as arc - length parametrized curves and their geometric representation as subsets of polygons or surfaces .",
    "an _ arc _ @xmath18 of a closed billiard trajectory in @xmath9 is a closed geodesic arc whose interior lies in @xmath9 and whose endpoints lie on @xmath19 .",
    "note that an endpoint of @xmath18 may be a vertex of @xmath9 , but such a vertex must lie in @xmath7 .",

    "this means that @xmath67 and @xmath73 intersect in @xmath22 by lemma [ lem - interlace ] .",
    "hence @xmath25 and @xmath74 intersect .",
    "applying powers of @xmath23 we see that @xmath29 and @xmath75 intersect , thus proving that @xmath6 is arcwise connected .",
    "secondly , suppose that every arc of @xmath25 connects adjacent sides of @xmath22 .",
    "every such arc has to connect interior points of the adjacent sides of @xmath22 for , otherwise , we would be in the first case . using lemma [ lem - intersect ] , we can find consecutive arcs @xmath67 and @xmath76 of @xmath25 meeting @xmath77 in three successive sides . to be precise ,",

    "note that because @xmath67 and @xmath76 are geodesic arcs , their only intersection point is their common endpoint .",
    "they therefore form an m - shaped curve . now consider @xmath81 , with endpoints",
    "@xmath82 $ ] , @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "if the sets @xmath85 and @xmath86 have a point in common , then @xmath25 and @xmath74 intersect , and so @xmath6 is connected as above .",
    "thus , we may assume these two sets are disjoint .",
    "it suffices to show that certain endpoints of these arcs interlace and so , using lemma [ lem - interlace ] , the corresponding arcs intersect .",
    "if @xmath34 denotes the natural anti - clockwise order on @xmath30\\cup[x_i , x_{i+1}]$ ] , then it is easy to show :    1 .   if @xmath87 then @xmath88 interlace , and so @xmath67 and @xmath73 intersect ; 2 .   if @xmath89 then @xmath90 interlace , and so @xmath76 and @xmath91 intersect ; 3 .",
    "if @xmath92 and @xmath93 then @xmath94 interlace , and so @xmath76 and @xmath73 intersect .",
    "the cases ( a)-(c ) are illustrated in figure [ fig - interlace ] .",
    "we observe that , since @xmath79 and @xmath95 then condition ( c ) is precisely the condition that both ( a ) and ( b ) fail . therefore these three cases exhaust all possibilities .",
    "the argument then follows as in the first case .",
    "this shows that @xmath6 is arcwise connected .",
    "since @xmath22 is topologically a disc every connected component @xmath96 of @xmath97 is a topological disc .",
    "if every point of @xmath98 lies in @xmath6 , then we have case ( a ) of definition [ def - fill ] .",
    "so suppose that @xmath98 contains a point of @xmath77 that is not contained in @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath98 contains a non - empty topological arc of @xmath77 both of whose endpoints lie in @xmath6 ( note this arc is not necessarily contained in just one side of @xmath22 ) .",
    "we claim that @xmath98 can contain at most one such topological arc in @xmath77 .",

    "therefore we can find a jordan arc @xmath103 from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ( that is from @xmath77 to itself ) in @xmath96 ( except for its end points ) so that the two connected components of @xmath104 each contains a point of @xmath6 , namely @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this contradicts the connectedness of @xmath6 .",
    "hence @xmath96 can contain at most one topological arc of @xmath77 in its boundary .",
    "recall , we are assuming such an arc exists , or else we are in case ( a ) of definition [ def - fill ] .",

    "in particular , @xmath6 does not pass through the vertex @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath6 is preserved by the symmetry map @xmath23 , we see that @xmath6 does not pass through any vertex of @xmath106 .",
    "since @xmath6 intersects the sides @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath12 $ ] and does not contain their endpoints , it must contain points of both their interiors .",
    "in particular , @xmath105 does not contain @xmath31 or @xmath14 .",
    "hence we are in case ( c ) of definition [ def - fill ] .",
    "finally , suppose that the interior of @xmath105 contains points from at least three sides of @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath105 is connected , this means it contains a whole side of @xmath22 , which contradicts the fact that , by symmetry , each side of @xmath22 intersects @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the only possibilities for @xmath98 are ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) from definition [ def - fill ] as required .",
