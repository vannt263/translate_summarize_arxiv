    "due to their occurrence in a wide variety of circumstances , systems consisting of a large number of coupled oscillators with different natural oscillation frequencies have been the subject of much scientific interest@xcite .",
    "examples where the study of such systems is thought to be relevant are synchronous flashing of fireflies@xcite and chirping of crickets@xcite , synchronous cardiac pacemaker cells@xcite , brain function@xcite , coordination of oscillatory neurons governing circadian rhythms in mammals@xcite , entrainment of coupled oscillatory chemically reacting cells@xcite , josephson junction circuit arrays@xcite , etc .",
    "the globally - coupled , phase - oscillator model of kuramoto@xcite exemplifies the key generic feature of large systems of coupled oscillators .",
    "in particular , kuramoto considered the case where the distribution function of oscillator frequencies was monotonically decreasing away from its peak value , and he showed that , as the coupling strength @xmath7 between the oscillators is increased through a critical coupling strength @xmath8 , there is a transition to sustained global cooperative behavior . in this state",
    "@xmath9 a suitable average over the oscillator population ( this average is often called the ` order parameter ' ) exhibits steady macroscopic oscillatory behavior . for @xmath10 a stimulus may transiently induce macroscopic oscillations , but the amplitude of these coherent oscillations ( i.e. , the magnitude of the order parameter ) decays exponentially to zero with increasing time@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider the kuramoto model in the parameter range @xmath10 , and we demonstrate that ` echo ' phenomena occur for this system .",
    "the basic echo phenomenon can be described as follows : a first stimulus is applied at time @xmath4 , and the response to it dies away ; next , a second stimulus is applied at a later time , @xmath5 , and its response likewise dies away ; then at time @xmath11 ( also possibly at @xmath12 , for @xmath13 ) an echo response spontaneously builds up and then decays away .",
    "an illustrative example is shown in fig .  1 , which was obtained by     and @xmath5 lead to direct system responses which rapidly decay away followed by echo responses that can arise at times @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the ` response ' plotted on the vertical axis is the magnitude of the complex valued order parameter , eq .",
    "see sec .",
    "iv for details of this computation . ]    numerical simulation ( see sec .",
    "iv for details ) . in order for this phenomenon to occur ,",
    "the system must have two fundamental attributes , nonlinearity and memory .",
    "nonlinearity is necessary because the response seen in fig .",
    "1 is not the same as the sum of the responses to each of the individual stimulus pulses in the absence of the other pulse ( which is simply the decay that occurs immediately after the individual stimuli , without the echo ) .",
    "memory is necessary in the sense that the system state after the decay of the second pulse must somehow encode knowledge of the previous history even though the global average of the system state , as represented by the order parameter , is approximately the same as before the two pulses were applied .",
    "echo phenomena of this type , occurring in systems of many oscillators having a spread in their natural oscillation frequencies , have been known for a long time .",
    "the first example was the ` spin echo ' discovered in 1950 by hahn@xcite , where the distribution of frequencies resulted from the position dependence of the precession frequency of nuclear magnetic dipoles in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "[ the spin echo forms the basis for modern magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . ] subsequently , echoes for cyclotron orbits of charged particles in a magnetic field have been studied for the cases in which the distribution in frequency was due to magnetic field inhomogeneity@xcite , relativistic dependence of the particle mass on its energy@xcite , and doppler shifts of the cyclotron frequency@xcite .",
    "another notable case is that of plasma waves , where the frequency distribution results from the doppler shift of the wave frequency felt by charged particles with different streaming velocities@xcite .",
    "although echo phenomena are well - known in the above settings , they have so far not received attention in the context of the kuramoto model and its many related situations .",
    "it is our purpose in the present paper to investigate that problem .",
    "two possible motivations for our study of echoes in the kuramoto model are that they provide increased basic understanding of the model and also that they may be of potential use as a basis for future diagnostic measurements of related systems ( see sec .",
    "v ) .    in what follows , sec .",

    "iii and numerically simulated in sec .",

    "v will provide a discussion of the implications of the results obtained .",
    "we consider the basic kuramoto model supplemented by the addition of a @xmath16-correlated noise term @xmath17 and two impulsive stimuli , one at time @xmath4 , and the other at time @xmath5 , @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath23 . in the above",

    "consider the example of a population of many fireflies , and imagine that the stimuli at @xmath4 and at @xmath5 are external flashes of light at those times , where the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) represent the intensity of these flashes .",
    "we hypothesize that a firefly will be induced by a stimulus flash to move its flashing phase toward synchronism with the stimulus flash .",
    "thus a firefly that has just recently flashed will reset its phase by retarding it , while a firefly that was close to flashing will advance its phase .",
    "the amount of advance or retardation is determined by the ` reset function ' , @xmath34 .",

    "we shall be considering only the case @xmath10 for which @xmath107 .",

    "( 16 ) is of constant magnitude in time , but , as time @xmath108 increases , it oscillates more and more rapidly as a function of @xmath115 . because of this increasingly rapid variation in @xmath115 , the contribution of this term to @xmath116 decays in time ( see appendix i ) , and it does so at the same time - asymptotic rate as the contribution from the second more rapidly exponentially decaying contribution in eq .",
    "thus the order parameter magnitude decays away , but the distribution function @xmath93 can still have a component ( the first term in eq .  ( 16 ) ) due to the pulse that has not decayed away .",
    "a similar conclusion applies for @xmath117 provided that @xmath69 is substantially less than the damping for the second term in eq .",
    "this is the source of the ` memory ' referred to in sec .  i. it is also worth noting that the first term in eq .",
    "( 16 ) can be thought of as the manifestation of the continuous spectrum of the kuramoto problem , discussed in detail in ref .",
    "thus the echo phenomenon that we derive subsequently can be regarded as an observable macroscopic consequence of the continuous spectrum , where by ` macroscopic ' we mean that the effect can be seen through monitoring of the order parameter without the necessity of other more detailed knowledge of the distribution function .",
    "it is also of interest to consider @xmath118 for @xmath119 . from eq .  (",

    "the above equation is linear in @xmath131 and is driven by several inhomogeneous terms appearing on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 23 ) that are quadratic in first order quantities .",
    "since we are interested in the components of @xmath131 that result in echoes , and since , by our previous discussion , we expect that the echoes depend on the presence of _ both _ stimulus delta functions ( i.e. , the delta function @xmath132 of strength @xmath133 and the delta function @xmath134 of strength @xmath135 ) , we are interested in the component of @xmath131 that is proportional to the product @xmath136 for @xmath137 . we denote this component @xmath138 , where the subscript @xmath139 stands for ` echo ' . from eq .",

    "@xcite shows that the order parameters ( or parameter ) , see eq .",
