    "describing a fluid flow , one labels particles of the fluid by means of lagrangian coordinates @xmath0 .",
    "one supposes , that any lagrangian coordinates @xmath1 label the same fluid particle all the time . applying laws of newtonian dynamics to any fluid particle , one obtains hydrodynamic equations for the fluid flow in the lagrangian representation ( in the lagrangian coordinates ) .",
    "the lagrangian representation is sensitive to the correct labeling of the fluid particles in the sense , that there are situations , when in different time moments the same lagrangian coordinates @xmath1 describe different fluid particles . for instance , if two like gas beams , consisting of noninteracting molecules , pass one through another , the particle labeling changes after `` collision '' of the two beams .",
    "the picture is shown in the figure , which describes world lines of gas particles in the space - time .",
    "the solid lines shows gas particle with the same labeling @xmath1 , whereas dashed lines show world lines of real gas molecules .",
    "in this example a violation of the fluid particle labeling after `` collision '' is evident .",
    "the stream lines , represented by solid lines , do not describe motion of real fluid particles .",
    "is it important ?",
    "can we observe stream lines of a fluid ?",
    "let us imagine that we introduce several flecks of dust in one of gas flows and follow their motion .",
    "we suppose that the size of flecks is larger , than the size of gas molecules , and any fleck interacts with many gas molecules .",
    "then we may think , that any fleck of dust moves along stream line of the fluid .",
    "as far as collision of any fleck of dust with gas molecules is random , the flecks of dust after `` collision '' appear in both gas beams , although before the `` collision '' they were placed only in one of them . on the other hand ,",
    "it is generally assumed , that flecks of dust moves together with the gas , and any fleck moves along the stream line of the fluid .",
    "observation of flecks of powder is a usual method of the stream lines investigation .",
    "the hydrodynamic description of a fluid is valid at the supposition , that one stream of a fluid can penetrate into the other one only to the depth of the mean length of collision path . in this case",
    "the interfusion of different streams of a fluid will be infinitesimal .",
    "however , such a small interfusion will take place , and this interfusion may appear to be essential for the shape of stream lines .",
    "such a physical phenomenon as turbulence can be discovered only , if one traces the irregular behavior of stream lines . in other words , for observation of turbulence a displacement of fluid particles is important , but not only their velocities .",
    "the velocities are important only as a source of displacement .",
    "a motion of the inviscid barotropic fluid is described by the euler equations    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the fluid density , @xmath4 is the fluid velocity , @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath6 is the fluid internal energy per unit mass .",
    "stream lines are described by a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "one supposes that fluid particles move along the stream lines @xmath7 , which are defined by the equation    @xmath8    where @xmath4 is a solution of the euler equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) .    the euler system ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) is a closed system of differential equations , which may be solved independently of equations ( a1.3 ) .",
    "the euler system is a system of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "it is difficult for solution .",
    "the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ a1.3 ] ) is simpler , than the euler system .",
    "besides , it can be solved only after solution of the euler system ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) .",
    "it is a reason , why researchers investigate mainly the euler system .",
    "the system of equations ( [ a1.3 ] ) for the stream lines remains usually outside the region of consideration as some triviality .",
    "however , the euler system ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) and equations ( a1.3 ) are dynamic equations of one dynamic system , and they should be considered together . this dynamic system will be referred as the complete hydrodynamic system .",
    "the euler equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) are not dynamic equations of a wholesome dynamic system , because the can not be deduced from a variational principle , whereas dynamic equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) , ( [ a1.3 ] ) can .",
    "it seems , that dynamic equations do not influence on the solution of dynamic equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) . in reality , it is true only for irrotational flows . in vortical",
    "flows a situation changes . in",
    "the vortical flows an interfusion appears .",
    "the interfusion is not so large as in figure with colliding gas beams .",
    "this interfusion is infinitesimal .",
    "it is conditioned by different velocities of adjacent fluid volumes .",
    "this infinitesimal interfusion influences on the shape of stream lines and on the labeling of the fluid particles , although it does not influence on quantities @xmath9 , which are solution of the euler system ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) .    in the case of the euler representation of hydrodynamic equations ,",
    "the fluid particle labeling is not necessary .",
    "the four hydrodynamic euler equations are obtained as a result of the conservation laws of the energy and momentum . however , in this case the conservation law of the angular momentum is not used , and one can not be sure , that the system of four euler equations for barotropic fluid describes completely rotational degrees of freedom of molecules and those of fluid particles .",
    "the rotational degrees of freedom may be essential in turbulent flows , where close consideration of rotational degrees of freedom may appear to be essential .",
    "in this paper we try to take into account interfusion , which appears in the rotational flows of the barotropic fluid .",
    "influence of interfusion manifests itself in labeling of the fluid particles by means of the lagrangian coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "this change of labeling is not important for solution of euler equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) , which form a closed system of differential equations .",
    "however , this change of labeling may appear to be important for such physical phenomena , where the shape of stream lines is essential ( such as turbulence ) .",
    "we consider connection between the labeling and the interfusion on the formal mathematical level .",
    "we shall consider the euler dynamic equation for inviscid barotropic fluid    we are interesting in the question , whether the labeling , generated by the equation ( [ a1.3 ] ) is an unique possible way of labeling . to solve this problem",
    ", we shall consider the lagrangian coordinates @xmath1 to be dependent dynamic variables .",
    "the eulerian coordinates @xmath11 are considered to be independent dynamic variables .",
    "thus , we consider dynamic system , described by seven dependent dynamic variables @xmath12 * * , * * which are functions of four independent variables @xmath11 .",
    "note that system of dynamic equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) is a closed system of dynamic equations .",
    "however , the dynamic system , described , by four dependent variables @xmath9 is not a wholesome dynamic system in the sense , that dynamic equations ( a1.1 ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) can not be obtained from some a variational principle .    to obtain dynamic equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) from the variational principle @xcite , one needs to add so - called lin constraints @xcite .",
    "this conditions have the form @xmath13it is easy to see , that characteristics of the linear differential equation ( [ b1.3])@xmath14coincide with the equation ( [ a1.3 ] ) .",
    "vice versa , any integral of the equation system ( [ a1.3 ] ) is a solution of the equation ( [ b1.3 ] )",
    ". the lin constraints ( [ b1.3 ] ) are interesting in the relation , that independent dynamic variables in ( [ b1.3 ] ) are the same , as in the dynamic equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) .",
    "hence , dynamic equations ( a1.1 ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) and dynamic equations ( [ b1.3 ] ) may be considered as dynamic equations of one dynamic system .",
    "it is rather difficult to consider system of equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) , ( [ a1.3 ] ) as a dynamic equations of a dynamic system , because independent variables are different in equations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.2 ] ) and ( [ a1.3 ] ) .",
    "let us note that the quantities @xmath1 may be considered to be the generalized stream function ( gsf ) , because @xmath1 have two main properties of the stream function .",
    "gsf @xmath1 labels stream lines of a fluid .",
    "some combinations of the first derivatives of any @xmath1 satisfy the continuity equation identically.@xmath15where @xmath16 is the 4-vector of flux .",
