    "the phenomenon of quantum teleportation ( qt ) has been experimentally demonstrated in quantum optics @xcite . but as is well known , this protocol can teleport only _ information _",
    "( i.e. , quantum mechanical information or quantum states ) and not _ physical objects_. thus , this protocol can not teleport energy because that requires a physical entity to act as an energy carrier .",
    "for example , electricity is transported over power transmission lines by electromagnetic waves that act as the carrier .",
    "recently , however , one of the authors proposed a quantum protocol termed quantum _ energy _ teleportation ( qet ) that avoids the problem by using classical information instead of energy carriers @xcite . in this counterintuitive protocol , the counterpart of the classical transmission lineis a quantum mechanical many - body system in the vacuum state ( i.e. , a correlated system formed by vacuum state entanglement @xcite . )",
    "the key lies using this correlated system ( hereinafter , the quantum correlation channel ) to exploit the zero - point energy of the vacuum state , which stems from zero - point fluctuations ( i.e. , nonvanishing vacuum fluctuations ) originating from the uncertainty principle .",
    "this energy , however , can not be conventionally extracted @xcite as that would require a state with lower energy than vacuum  a contradiction .",
    "in fact , no local operation can extract energy from vacuum , but must instead inject energy ; this property is called passivity @xcite . according to qet , however , if we limit only the _ local _ vacuum state instead of all the vacuum states , the passivity of the local vacuum state can be destroyed and a part of the zero - point energy can in fact be extracted .    as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , a qet system to transfer energy from subsystem a to b consists of four elements : ( i )  a quantum correlation channel , ( ii ) a local measurement system for subsystem a defined on the quantum correlation channel , ( iii ) a classical channel for communicating the measurement result , and ( iv ) a local operation system for subsystem b. essentially , qet can be regarded as quantum feedback protocol implemented via local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the procedure is as follows : first , we measure the local field fluctuations at subsystem a. the obtained result includes information about local fluctuations at subsystem  b because of the vacuum state entanglement via the quantum correlation channel @xcite .",
    "this is because the kinetic energy term in the field hamiltonian generates the entanglement and provides partial correlation between local vacuum fluctuations .",
    "thus , owing to passivity of the vacuum state , the measurement causes some energy ( @xmath0 ) to be injected into subsystem a. next , the obtained result is communicated to subsystem b via a classical channel .",
    "since the measurement performed at subsystem a is _ local _ , subsystem b remains in a local vacuum state .",
    "as mentioned above , if a good local operation is performed at subsystem b using the information gained at subsystem a , it will be possible to extract some amount of the zero - point energy of subsystem b , @xmath1 .",
    "thus , this protocol only gives permission  to use the otherwise unavailable energy at b. if we define `` teleportation '' as a process of transferring energy to a remote location without a physical energy carrier , we can say that energy is teleported by this protocol .",
    "although the validity of this protocol has been confirmed _ mathematically _ , its _ physical _ significance remains questionable : what type of physical system is necessary for implementing qet ?",
    "what is the composition of the quantum correlation channel ? can significant amounts of energy be teleported ?",
    "unfortunately , all past proposals for experimental verification of qet can not teleport sufficient amounts of energy to be measured with present technology @xcite . here , we discuss a more realistic possible implementation and estimate the order of the teleported  energy using reasonable experimental parameters .",
    "verification of qet in a realistic system requires the following : ( i ) a dissipationless system , ( ii ) a quantum correlation channel with a macroscopic correlation length , ( iii ) detection and operation schemes for well - defined fluctuations in the vacuum state , and ( iv ) a suitable implementation of locc .    to this end",
    ", we consider a quantum hall ( qh ) system as a potential candidate .",
    "the qh effect is observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems in semiconductors subjected to a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the qh system satisfies requirement ( i ) because the qh effect does not offer any resistance .",
    "further , in this system , quasi - one - dimensional channels called edge channels appear at the boundary of the 2d incompressible region of the qh system ( i.e. , qh bulk ) .",
    "such an edge channel can behave as a _",
    "chiral _ luttinger liquid @xcite , along which electric current flows in a unidirectional manner .",
    "this attribute is indicative of the chirality of the edge channel .",
    "moreover , in experiments , the edge channel shows power - law behaviors and does not have a specific decay length @xcite , preferable for fairly long - distance teleportation .",
    "thus , an edge channel satisfies requirement ( ii ) .",
    "furthermore , an edge channel can be universally characterized by charge fluctuations described by a gapless free boson field in the vacuum state , independently of the detailed structures of the qh bulk state .",
    "therefore , the target zero - point fluctuation is the fluctuation of the charge density wave ( i.e. , a magnetoplasmon @xcite ) propagating in a unidirectional manner along an edge channel ) .",
    "this implies that owing to the coulomb interaction , a conventional capacitor can be used as a sensitive probe and control method for detecting and manipulating zero - point fluctuations of vacuum .",
    "given these facts , it can be said that ( iii ) is satisfied .",
    "lastly , for a qh system , semiconductor nanotechnology can be used to design on - chip locc , thus satisfying requirement ( iv ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , element ( i ) , i.e. , the quantum correlation channel , is the left - going edge channel @xmath2 . to produce the vacuum state",
    ", @xmath2 should be connected to an ideal electric ground , and experiments should be performed at low temperatures  on the order of millikelvin ( mk ) .",
    "regions a and b , physically corresponding to subsystems a and b , respectively , are defined by fabricating micrometer - scale metal gate electrodes ( i.e. , a microscopic capacitor ) on @xmath2 .     and",
    "@xmath3 are formed at the boundaries of qh bulk regions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the red and blue arrows indicate the directions of propagation of charge waves.,width=325 ]    element ( ii ) , used for local measurement of the zero - point fluctuations ( i.e. , charge fluctuations ) , comprises a metal gate electrode fabricated on @xmath2 at region a as well as an amplifier and a switch .",
    "the input resistance @xmath4 of the amplifier and capacitance @xmath5 between @xmath2 and the gate electrode at region a constitute an rc circuit .",
    "when the switch is turned on , the information on the charge fluctuations in @xmath2 is imprinted on the quantum voltage fluctuations of the electric circuit via the coulomb interaction and then enhanced by the amplifier . here",
    ", the on - chip electrical circuit serves the function of the voltmeter shown in the schematic in fig .",
    "as explained later , we can assume that this rc circuit and amplifier can operate fast enough , and the circuit can be considered as performing a positive operator valued measure ( povm)-type measurement @xcite . the amplified signal @xmath6 ( i.e. , measurement result ) is transferred through a classical channel ( element ( iii ) ) , which corresponds to an electric wire .",
    "element ( iv ) , used for the local operation , includes another edge channel @xmath7 placed such that @xmath7 and @xmath2 approach each other at region b. it also consists of a metal gate electrode fabricated on @xmath7 at region g and a measurement instrument such as a picoammeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the experimental procedure is a follows : first , we cool down the entire system , except the measurement instruments , to the lowest temperature possible ( on the order of several mk ) to achieve the vacuum state .",
    "next , we turn on the switch only for a period of @xmath8 .",
    "when a voltage signal @xmath6 arrives at region g , it excites a charge wave packet on @xmath7 via capacitive coupling . because of the chirality of the edge channel",
    ", the charge wave packet travels in a unidirectional manner along @xmath7 , carrying energy @xmath9 toward region b , where the wave packet interacts with the zero - point fluctuation of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the energy carried by the wave packet changes from @xmath9  to @xmath10 . finally , we measure the signal with the picoammeter connected to @xmath7 and thereby estimate the energy carried by the wave packet .",
    "this is a unit cycle of a single - shot measurement .",
    "we may repeat this single - shot measurement a sufficient number of times to generate meaningful statistics .",
    "finally , we can use the results to estimate the average energy @xmath11 carried by the wave packets . to verify that qet is actually occurring",
    ", we must also perform a control experiment in which region g is disconnected from the classical channel and instead connected to a signal generator to excite wave packets _ independently _ of @xmath6 .",
    "if wave packets are created by the signal generator ( i.e. , no information about @xmath6 is communicated ) , they will inject energy into @xmath2 because of the passivity of the vacuum state @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath12 will be negative .",
    "however , in our system , since wave packets explicitly depend on @xmath6 , passivity is disturbed and @xmath11 can take a positive value ; in other words , positive energy is extracted from the zero - point fluctuations of @xmath2 . finally ,",
    "if @xmath11 is larger in qet  experiment than in the control , we can conclude the qet theory is valid ",
    "energy is teleported  from a to b without physical carriers to transport that energy . in what follows",
    ", we prove this argument theoretically and estimate @xmath1 by setting the experimental parameters @xmath13k@xmath14 @xcite ; @xmath15  ff ; and @xmath16  m / s @xcite , were @xmath17 is the group velocity of a charge density wave .",

    "here we discuss the chiral field of the edge channels .",
    "details on the treatment of the chiral field can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "let us start the detailed discussion with a model of the edge channel @xmath2 . the chiral field operator @xmath20 satisfies a commutation relation , @xmath21   = i\\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi } \\partial_{x}\\delta(x - x^{\\prime})$ ] .",
    "the energy density operator of @xmath20 is written as@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the landau level filling factor of @xmath2 and @xmath24 denotes normal ordering , which makes the expectation value of @xmath25 to be zero for the vacuum state @xmath26 ; @xmath27 .",
    "the free hamiltonian of @xmath2 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenvalue of the vacuum state vanishes : @xmath29 .",
    "if the vacuum state is not entangled , the two - point correlation function of @xmath30 with @xmath31 is exactly zero .",
    "however , this entangled vacuum state provides a nontrivial correlation : @xmath32 this correlation function can be calculated by using creation and annihilation operators of the free field . taking region a for @xmath33   $ ] ,",
    "we adopt the rc - circuit - detector model proposed by fve _",

    "the coupled hamiltonian of @xmath2 and the rc circuit can be directly diagonalized , enabling analytical estimation of various physical quantities @xcite .",

    "now , we estimate the corresponding measurement operators @xcite of this voltage measurement .",
    "clearly , this is difficult to achieve with sufficient accuracy with a microscopic model .",
    "however , after the amplification of the quantum noise of the voltage @xmath38 , the signal becomes macroscopic and classical .",
    "thus , we may estimate the measurement operators of the macroscopic system comprising subsystem a , the amplifier , and the electric wire by reducing the measurement to the pointer - basis proposed by von neumann @xcite .",
    "for this , let us begin with a gedankenexperiment in which a high - speed voltage meter is connected to the amplifier .",
    "thus , the position of the meter pointer instantaneously shifts according to the signal strength .",
    "assume that the pointer shift is equal to eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in the same manner as that used by von neumann @xcite , we can treat the macroscopic system including this voltage meter with quantum mechanics , even though the meter is macroscopic and classical",
    ". the readout of the meter pointer can be , therefore , treated as a kind of quantum measurement , which can be described by measurement operators @xmath56 @xcite with the output value of @xmath57 .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) can be reproduced by a macroscopic measurement hamiltonian given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the conjugate momentum operator of @xmath39 .",

    "now , let us turn to the edge channel @xmath7 and discuss how wave packets can be excited at g ( i.e. , how to send the measurement result to b ) .",
