    "recently a number of systems which can be effectively reduced to a two - level systems [ 1 - 4 ] have been examined as candidates for quantum computing hardware .",
    "these include e.g. ion traps , nuclear spins in molecules , charge and flux states of superconducting circuits .",
    "maintaining the coherence of quantum device is a major challenge - the device should be maximally decoupled from the environment to avoid decoherence and thus the loss of quantum information .",
    "in addition to further work on existing systems new candidates for qubits can be investigated .",
    "we are considering the mesoscopic ring made of a metal , semiconductor or toroidal carbon nanotube .",
    "persistent currents ( pc ) in small nonsuperconducting rings threaded by a magnetic flux are a manifestation of quantum coherence in a submicron system .",
    "if the ring circumference @xmath0 is smaller than the phase coherence length @xmath1 the electron wave function may extend coherently over @xmath0 even in the presence of elastic scatterers [ 5,6 ] .",
    "in other words a normal loop with @xmath2 has a nontrivial ground state with a circulating pc .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that quantum tunneling between states with nearly equal energies and opposite persistent currents in clean mesoscopic nonsuperconducting quasi 1d ring with a barrier can lead to a formation of a qubit .",
    "we argue that at low t such ring can be effectively reduced to a two - state system with two external control parameters .",
    "quantum tunneling between the states leads to the quantum superposition of two opposed current states .",
    "the problem of the qubit decoherence is also discussed .",
    "let us consider the mesoscopic metallic or semiconducting quasi @xmath3 ring of radius @xmath4 ( @xmath5 in the presence of static magnetic flux @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the applied magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the ring .",
    "mesoscopic systems are expected to behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics if they are separated well from the external degrees of freedom .",

    "we can see from fig .  1 that at @xmath17 ( and all integral @xmath23 ) , if the number of electrons in the ring @xmath25 then the level at the fs is doubly degenerate and occupied by a single electron only .",
    "the same situation happens at half integral @xmath23 , for @xmath26 .",
    "because the energy spectrum is periodic with period @xmath27 , we can restrict our considerations to the neighborhood of the two degeneracy points @xmath17 ( for @xmath28 and @xmath29  ( for @xmath30 .",
    "the electron at the fs behaves there as a particle in a double well potential , where the states in each well correspond to pc of opposite sign .",
    "it follows from ( [ dwa ] ) that with increasing magnetic field the ground state will change from angular momentum @xmath31  to one with higher @xmath32 .",
    "we now introduce to the ring an energy barrier of finite length @xmath33 and height @xmath34 ( positive or negative ) . in this case",
    "the tunneling occurs which mixes the states from both sides of the barrier . at the degeneracy",
    "points the eigenstates which are superposition of states with different winding numbers can be formed .",
    "this causes the splitting of the initial energy levels ( fig .  2 ) .",

    "one of them is the ring in which the small fragment of a convex arc have been deformed to form a concave one @xcite .",
    "one can produce such a mechanical deformation by pressing .",
    "another possibility to form the barrier is the local point - like electric gate close to the ring .",
    "the electric potential of the gate forms the barrier , the height of which can be modified by the gate voltage .",

    "the barrier height and therefore the mixing term @xmath54 can be adjusted to the required value . to make the barrier more local we can use atomic force microscope or scanning tunneling microscope .",
    "additionally one can regulate the barrier height by the change of the potential of the tip .",
    "the other possibility is to place the single wall carbon nanotube in the plane of the ring perpendicular to it and apply the voltage to it .",
    "another realization of such system can be obtained by using a toroidal carbon nanotube ( cn ) .",
    "it is known that the defect free metallic cn behaves like real 1d wire @xcite .",
    "this is due to the small ( two ) number of channels available close to the fs .",
    "the fs consists of two points where the two bands cross .",
    "the properties of an ideal toroidal cn depend on the position with respect to the honeycomb lattice of two circles : circumference of cn and circumference of the torus , defining chiral and twist vectors @xmath89 respectively @xcite . in our model",
    "we assume that only one electron occupies the fs which is doubly degenerate . in cn - s which are metallic in both vectors : @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are integers , there are four accessible states at the fs .",
    "if however a cn is metallic only in the chiral direction @xmath94 and not metallic in twist direction @xmath95 , we obtain the required structure by applying a flux @xmath96 , in the direction parallel to the torus symmetry axis .",
    "the dispersion relation of cn @xcite is different from that of quasi 1d ring .",
    "however , in the neighborhood of the fermi points both relations become similar i.e. linear in @xmath23 and producing opposite currents @xcite . because the states close to the fs are well separated from the excited states the system can also be treated as a two - level system . as an example we consider the metallic armchair cn ( @xmath97 ) having the radius @xmath98 and the width @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the energy gap between the first unoccupied state and the state at the fs is @xmath100 .",
    "the current of an electron at the fs can be roughly approximated by    @xmath101    the current amplitude@xmath102 is inversely proportional to @xmath4 but independent of the toroid width .",
    "one obtains @xmath103 or equivalently the magnetic flux @xmath104 for the assumed parameters .",
    "the mixing term @xmath54 is again due to the potential barrier along the toroidal cn .",
    "it can be obtained by a non smooth junction of both its ends by e.g. a fulleren molecule @xcite or by simply leaving a small gap between the ends .",
    "alternatively , one can replace a fragment of a toroidal nanotube with the one of similar circumference but different conductivity properties ( e.g. @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) @xcite . finally , to obtain a system described by ( [ hsigma ] )",
    "one can apply a real magnetic field perpendicular to the torus symmetry axis close to the degeneracy point @xmath107",
    "@xcite@xmath108    in our model calculations we have made simplifying assumptions that the ring is quasi @xmath3 and its energy states ( [ dwa ] ) are single particle states .",
    "however the presented considerations are also valid with some modificationsfor the mesoscopic metallic or semiconducting ring with very small thickness @xmath109 , @xmath110  i.e. with a few transverse channels @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the nanoscopic , semiconducting , defect - free quasi @xmath3 rings in which the electronic states are in the true quantum limit have been already realized @xcite .",
    "the change in the ground state angular momentum numbered by @xmath32 has been observed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the ring .",
    "they also found that the single particle states are a quite accurate basis for a description of the many particle states .",
    "similar findings have been also obtained for cn tori @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is also supported by persistent current measurements @xcite on ballistic semiconducting rings with a few transverse channels .",
    "it was found that the measured current is of the same order as the current amplitude of noninteracting electrons @xmath111 .",
    "this means that electron - electron interaction in real quantum rings is not so strong . for weakly interacting electrons we can consider the effect of the interaction @xcite by a barrier renormalization .",

    "the interaction parameter @xmath117 can be expressed in terms of the luttinger liquid stiffness constant @xmath118 ( @xmath119 is the plasmon velocity ) : @xmath120\\ ] ] for weakly interacting electrons ( @xmath121 ) @xmath122 and",
    "the effect of the interactions is small .",
    "thus the idea of the formation of flux qubit on mesoscopic ring is still valid for the interacting electrons .",
    "till now we neglected the electron spin .",
    "the orbital magnetic moments minot , @xcite in small ring structures are an order of magnitude larger than spin moments and usually the orbital states are successively populated with spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "neglecting the small spin splitting in the magnetic field our picture with spin included does not change qualitatively but more possibilities occur .",
    "if the number of electron is @xmath123 the tunneling can take place at @xmath124 .",
    "for other values of @xmath125 tunneling can take place at @xmath17 and/or @xmath126    flux qubit proposed by us is based on the similar idea as the flux qubit built on superconducting ring @xcite .",
    "also the measurement of the flux state can be performed by a separate squid magnetometer inductively coupled to it in a similar way as in a superconducting case .",
    "two or more qubits can be coupled by means of the flux that the circulating current generate .",
    "the quality of an effective information retrieval devices depends on the conditions of its coherence .",
    "the question is to what extent the device behaves quantum mechanically when placed in noisy environment generated by various fluctuations or measurement .",
    "thus the important constraints on the device are dephasing effects due to various decoherence sources .",
    "below we discuss and estimate some of the main decoherence sources .",
    "there is a natural question how the typical values of phase coherence length @xmath127 , which is of the order of @xmath128 @xcite translate into an applicability of mesoscopic rings as the qubit with relatively long decoherence times .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath129 and that @xmath130 . under these conditions",
    "the currents running in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium are genuinely persistent @xcite .",
    "the finite decoherence time of the current is due to the interaction with the outside world and leads to the persistence of the currents on a time scale much longer than the coherence time @xmath131 .",
    "we also assume that a system is put in a shield , that screens it from the unwanted radiation .",
    "thin mesoscopic quantum rings are the systems with relatively small number of degrees of freedom comparing with other solid state devices based on superconducting rings .",
    "however they are still able to accommodate various intrinsic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "thermal motion of any charge carriers is a source of thermal fluctuations related to the electronic nyquist noise . at low t the weak electron - phonon coupling",
    "gives some decrease of the current amplitude but it does not lead to substantial level shifting and broadening .",
    "the effect of thermal noise on the equilibrium statistics of persistent currents has been studied in a semi - classical regime in @xcite .",
    "the qubit can also decohere by spontaneous emission of photons .",
    "it follows from general considerations that this effect is small for the qubit size smaller than the radiated wavelength ( qubit is then an inefficient antenna)@xcite . taking for our qubit",
    "e.g. @xmath67 we estimated @xmath132 and for @xmath133 @xmath134 - thus the radiation is not a serious source of decoherence .",
    "the coupling between the magnetic moments of the current loops and those of nuclear spins can also be a reason of decoherence .",
    "however it may be considerably reduced by aligning the spins or by applying the compensating pulse sequences @xcite .",
    "we also estimated the dephasing from the unwanted dipol - dipol coupling @xcite .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath135 if the qubits are at the distance of @xmath136 .",
    "because our basic states are flux states , the qubit will be sensitive to a flux noise but relatively insensitive to a charge noise .",
    "thus we expect that magnetic degrees of freedom in quantum rings should have longer decoherence times than charge degrees of freedom .",
    "the fluctuations in the barrier and in the magnetic field necessary to get the degeneracy of the states for @xmath137 can be also the source of decoherence . however the system for @xmath138 is naturally bistable requiring no external bias .",
    "the most important class of fluctuations comes from the inductive coupling of the qubit to the measuring apparatus which is often a dc squid .",
    "it can be analyzed along the treatment developed for superconducting flux qubit @xcite which can be generalized to related systems .",
    "we assume that the measurement is performed with the same device as in @xcite .",
    "the flux qubit coupled to the squid is an effective dissipative two state or spin - boson system .",
    "there are two time scales related to the effect of environment .",
    "the first is the characteristic relaxation time of populations to approach an equilibrium gibbs - like form .",
    "the second is the decoherence time after which coherences become negligible @xcite .",
    "the relaxation @xmath139 and dephasing @xmath140 rates obtained using the spin - boson model for the system at temperature @xmath141 are @xcite @xmath142 and @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a spectral density function characterizing fully the environment and @xmath145 is the ohmicity parameter . the impedance @xmath146 of the dc squid is a source of thermal voltage fluctuations @xmath147 of the statistics governed by the nyquist theorem .",
    "this fluctuations are related via current - voltage characteristics to the current fluctuations @xmath148 and then inherited by the inductively coupled qubit @xcite : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the fluctuation of the magnetic flux due to the measuring device .",
    "it leads in our case to the following spectral density @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the mutual inductance coefficient , @xmath153 is the qubit level spacing .",
    "@xmath154,@xmath155 are the currents in the qubit and squid respectively .",
    "the effect of fluctuations on the tunneling term @xmath156 can be included in a similar way .",
    "however the effect of such fluctuations is relatively weak .    in these formulas a dimensionless factor @xmath157 is a measure of the coupling of the qubit and the measuring squid .",
    "its magnitude @xmath158 has been estimated for the superconducting qubit @xcite . in our case as the size of the nonsuperconducting ring is smaller , the coupling constant @xmath159 is also smaller .",
    "for the ring with @xmath160 ( toroidal nanotube ) we estimated @xmath161 . assuming the same parameters for the measuring device as in @xcite we obtain @xmath162 and @xmath163 .    in the nonsuperconducting flux qubit",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is relatively small in comparison to the superconducting devices .",
    "on one hand it limits significantly the number of decoherence mechanisms but on the other hand as the system is normal one can not expect the suppression of some fluctuations as in the superconducting case .",
    "therefore because the state of the mesoscopic ring is not completely stable , some random fluctuations of the current are expected ; actually some modifications of the aharonov - bohm oscillations on a time scale of @xmath164 have been observed @xcite .",
    "finally , small size of the qubit helps to reduce the influence of the environment @xcite what is significant for the effective engineering . we can estimate the influence of various decoherence sources but it is impossible to determine the real decoherence time with certainty , except by measurement .",
    "the qubit level spacing sets @xcite the fastest operation time to @xmath165 .",
    "thus the quality factor is of the order of @xmath166 .",
    "our model could in principle be tested on quantum rings investigated in fuhrer,@xcite after the application of the effective field @xmath76 i.e. when one introduces a controllable potential barrier .",
    "the extended discussion of the effective engineering of the decoherence for the nonsuperconducting flux qubit is postponed to further publication .",
    "the advantage of microscopic quantum systems ( atoms , spins ) for the qubit formation is that they can be easily isolated from the environment .",
    "the disadvantage is that the integration of many qubits into complex circuit is a difficult task . from that point of view",
    "solid state devices like charge and flux qubits built on superconducting rings are easier to integrate in a quantum computer using standard circuit technology",
    ". however the large number of degrees of freedom makes it more difficult to maintain the coherence .",
    "the proposed flux qubit built on normal quantum ring is on the border line between these two structures .",
    "the small number of degrees of freedom together with the small size of the qubit helps to decouple it from the environment .",
    "the proposed qubit can be addressed , manipulated , coupled to each other and read out.the quality factor giving the number of quantum logic operations is of the order of @xmath166 .",
