    "500  @xmath1 m away from the laser spot .",
    "the remote pl is attributed to the recombination of ixs transported by the saw at the edges of the ste , where the sudden reduction of the vertical field @xmath0 creates a potential barrier blocking the ix transport @xcite .  as the ixs",

    "we observe a slight broadening of the pl profile as well as the development of a tail with increasing transport distances .",
    "these features , which will be addressed in details elsewhere,@xcite are attributed to trapping sites along the transport path induced by potential fluctuations , which capture ix and delay their propagation .",

    "the saw - driven long - range ix flow can be efficiently controlled by the exat transistor placed on the transport path . the exat electrode configuration ( cf .",
    "[ exat](a ) ) is similar to the exciton optoelectronic transistor introduced in refs.@xcite . here",
    ", the voltage applied to the gate electrode ( g ) creates ( via the qcse ) a tunable energy barrier , which controls the acoustically driven ix flow between the source ( s ) and the drain ( d ) electrodes .",

    "note that the negative @xmath24i@xmath25 values around the excitation spot are due to the ix extraction by the saw and their transport along the saw propagation direction . in the on state ( fig .",

    "the numerical analysis of the ix transport across the exat described in the sm show that the effect of the source , gate and drain edges on the exciton flow are negligible when the exat is in the on state .",

    "this question is relevant since the remote pl in ix transport experiments under a single ste can also be induced by the recombination of one type of carrier transported along the semiconductor channel with carriers of opposite polarity injected from the contacts ( as for the ix bright spots reported in @xcite ) . in order to address this issue",
    ", we have determined the absolute sensitivity of the setup , which is defined as the photon flux required for a given count rate measured on the ccd camera detecting the pl .",
    "the sensitivity calibration was carried out using a reference laser beam reflected on a metal film deposited on the sample surface . knowing the reflectance of the metal , it is possible to estimate the absolute reflected flux of photons .",
    "the ratio between the photon flux collected by the microscope objective in front of the sample and the ccd count rate gives the required calibration coefficient .",
    "the number of photons generated via the recombination of ixs was determined from the measured ccd count rate by taking into account the collection angle ( which depends on the refractive index of the sample layers and on the numerical aperture of the objective lens ) and the transmission of the semi - transparent metal electrodes .",
    "if the pl signal comes from the recombination of one type of carriers transported by the saw with carriers of opposite polarity electrically injected from the electric contacts , we expect the contact current to be given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the detected photon flux and @xmath28 the electron charge .",
    "if the measured current is much less than @xmath29 , then at most of the electrons or holes forming the ixs must have been transported along the dqw structure by the saw . for the experimental conditions of fig .",
    "2b , where the laser beam is placed on the drain electrode , the measured photon flux in the source of the exat would require a source current @xmath30  na .",
    "this current is two orders of magnitude larger than the measured source current ( of 0.5  na ) under the same illumination conditions , showing that both electrons and holes must have been transported by the saw .",
