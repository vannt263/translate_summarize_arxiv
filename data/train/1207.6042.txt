    "gaia is an esa ( european space agency ) all sky astrometric , photometric , and spectroscopic survey mission aimed at measuring parallaxes , proper motions , radial velocities , and astrophysical parameters of @xmath010@xmath3 stars ( @xmath01% of the galactic stellar population ) down to magnitude g@xmath020 , extracted from @xcite . ] , corresponding to v@xmath02025  mag , depending on spectral type .",
    "the astrometric accuracy is expected to be 514  @xmath4as for bright stars ( v@xmath512  mag ) , and to reach @xmath0300  @xmath4as down to v@xmath020  mag .",
    "radial velocities will be measured for stars brighter than v@xmath017  mag , depending on spectral type , and their precision will range from 1  km  s@xmath6 for the bright stars down to 1520  km  s@xmath6 for the faintest stars , bluer stars having higher uncertainties . the updated science performances of gaia can be found on the gaia esa webpage .",
    "the expected launch will be in august 2013 , from the esa launch site at kourou in french guiana .",
    "gaia will operate for approximately 5 years , with a possible 1 year extension , and the final catalogue is expected to be published 3 years after mission completion , while a set of intermediate releases is presently being defined .    ,",
    "height=264 ]    although the primary scientific goal of gaia is the characterization of the milky way , its scientific impact will range from solar system studies to distant quasars , from unresolved galaxies to binaries , from supernovae to microlensing events , from fundamental physics to stellar variability .",
    "the wide variety of scientific topics is illustrated by almost 900 papers in ads ( astrophysics data system , of which more than 200 refereed ) to date , on a diversity of subjects , from the description of various mission components ( including software , pipelines , data treatment philosophy ) to simulations of the expected scientific harvest in many diverse areas . some papers",
    "summarize the expected science results ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no single paper can be complete in this respect , given the huge range of possibilities opened by gaia .",
    "three main instruments can be found on board gaia , the af ( astrometric field ) , consisting of 62 ccds illuminated with white light , which will provide astrometric measurements and integrated gaia g - band magnitudes ( hereafter g ) ; the bp ( blue photometer ) and rp ( red photometer ) , consisting of two strips of 7 ccds each and providing prism dispersed , slitless spectra at a resolution of r=@xmath7@xmath020100 , covering the passbands shown in figure  [ fig_bands ] and also providing integrated bp and rp magnitudes ( hereafter g@xmath8 and g@xmath9 ) and the g@xmath8g@xmath9 colour , which will be fundamental for chromaticity corrections of the astrometric measurements ; and the rvs ( radial velocity spectrograph ) , providing r@xmath011000 spectra in the calcium triplet region ( 84708740   ) projected onto 12 ccds",
    ". the mission output will thus be accurate positions , proper motions and parallaxes , low resolution bp / rp spectra , integrated g , g@xmath8 , and g@xmath9 magnitudes and the g@xmath8g@xmath9 colour , plus medium resolution rvs spectra and radial velocities for stars brighter than v@xmath017  mag .",
    "a classification of all observed objects will be performed on the basis of bp / rp and rvs spectra and  when possible  their parametrization will be performed as well , which for stars will provide t@xmath10 , log@xmath11 , e(b  v ) , [ fe / h ] , and [ @xmath12/fe ] .",
    "although gaia is in principle a self - calibrating mission , some gaia measurements need to be tied to existing absolute reference systems , and many gaia algorithms need to be trained .",
    "thus extensive theoretical computations and observing campaigns are being carried out .",
    "to make a few examples : radial velocity standards that are stable to 1  km  s@xmath6 are being obtained @xcite ; extended libraries of observed and theoretical spectra @xcite are being established ; the ecliptic poles  that will be repeatedly observed in the initial calibration phase of gaia observations ",
    "are being observed to produce catalogues of magnitudes and high - resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "also , the selection and analysis of reference stars ( and galaxies , quasars , asteroids , solar system objects and so on ) for the training of gaia algorithms is being carried on by different groups .",
    "this paper is the first of a series , which will present different aspects of the survey and of its data products .",
    "the series will include technical papers on the instrumental characterization , data papers presenting flux tables , photometric measurements , and lightcurves of our spss candidates , and scientific follow - up papers based on survey data and , when needed , on additional data .",
    "this paper presents the ongoing observational survey aimed at building the grid of spectrophotometric standard stars ( spss ) for the absolute flux calibration of gaia spectra and integrated magnitudes .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : the gaia external calibration model is briefly illustrated in section  [ sec - model ] ; the selection criteria and a list of candidate spss are presented in section  [ sec - spss ] ; the observing campaigns and facilities are described in section  [ sec - survey ] ; a description of the data treatment principles and methods can be found in section  [ sec - reds ] ; and a set of preliminary results is presented in section  [ sec - res ] .",
    "calibrating ( spectro)photometry obtained from the usual type of ground based observations ( broadband imaging , spectroscopy ) is not a trivial task , but the procedures are well known ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and many groups have developed sets of appropriate standard stars for the more than 200 photometric known systems , and for spectroscopic observations .    in the case of gaia , several instrumental effects ",
    "much more complex than those usually encountered  redistribute light along the sed ( spectral energy distribution ) of the observed objects .",
    "the most difficult gaia data to calibrate are the bp and rp slitless spectra , requiring a new approach to the derivation of the calibration model and to the spss grid needed to perform the actual calibration .",
    "some important complicating effects are :    * the large focal plane with its large number of ccds makes it so that different observations of the same star will be generally on different ccds , with different quantum efficiencies , optical distorsions , transmissivity and so on .",
    "therefore , each wavelength and each position across the focal plane has its ( sometimes very different ) psf ( point spread function ) ; * tdi ( time delayed integration ) continuous reading mode , combined with the need of compressing most of the data before on - ground transmission , make it necessary to translate the full psf into a linear ( compressed into 1d ) lsf ( line spread function ) , which of course adds complication into the picture ; * in - flight instrument monitoring is foreseen , but never comparable to the full characterization that will be performed before launch , so the real instrument  at a certain observation time  will be slightly different from the theoretical one assumed initially , and this difference will change with time ; * finally , radiation damage ( or cti , charge transfer inefficiencies ) deserves special mention , for it is one of the most important factors in the time variation of the instrument model @xcite .",
    "it has particular impact onto the bp and rp dispersed images because the objects travel along the bp and rp ccd strips in a direction that is parallel to the spectral dispersion ( wavelength coordinate ) and therefore the net effect of radiation damage can be to alter the sed of some spectra .",
    "several solutions are being implemented to mitigate cti effects , but the global instrument complexity calls for a new approach to spectra flux calibrations .    a flux calibration model",
    "is currently implemented in the photometric pipeline , which splits the calibration into an _",
    "internal _ and an _ external _ part .",
    "the internal calibration model @xcite uses a large number of well behaved stars ( internal standards ) , observed by gaia , to report all observations to a _ reference _ instrument , on the same instrumental relative flux and wavelength scales .",
    "once each observation for each object is reported to the internal reference scales , the absolute or _ external _",
    "calibration @xcite will use an appropriate spss set to report the relative flux scale to an absolute flux scale in physical units , tied to the calibration of vega ( see also section  [ sec - spss ] ) .",
    "alternative approaches where the internal and external calibration steps are more inter - connected are being tested to maximise the precision and the accuracy of the gaia calibration @xcite .",
    "the gaia calibration model was also described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the final flux calibrated products will be : averaged ( on all transits  or observations ) white light magnitudes , g ; integrated bp / rp magnitudes , g@xmath8 and g@xmath9 ; flux calibrated bp / rp spectra ; rvs spectra and integrated g@xmath13 magnitudes , possibly also flux calibrated @xcite . the g@xmath8g@xmath9 colour will be used to correct for chromaticity effects in the global astrometric solution . only for specific classes of objects , epoch spectra and magnitudes",
    "will be released , with variable stars as an obvious example .",
    "the external calibration model contains  as discussed  a large number of parameters , requiring a large number ( about 200 ) of calibrators . with the standard calibration techniques @xcite , the best possible calibrators are hot , almost featureless stars such as wd or hot subdwarfs .",
    "unfortunately , these stars are all similar to each other , forming an intrinsically degenerate set .",
    "the gaia calibration model instead requires to differentiate as much as possible the calibrators , by including smooth spectra , but also spectra with absorption features , both narrow ( atomic lines ) or wide ( molecular bands ) , appearing both on the blue and the red side of the spectrum . an experiment described by @xcite shows that the inclusion of just a few m stars with large molecular absorptions in the gaia spss set can improve the calibration of similarly red stars by a factor of more than ten ( from a formal error of 0.15  mag to an error smaller than 0.01  mag ) .",
    "45  deg from the ecliptic poles ( roughly where gaia is observing more often ) are shaded in grey .",
    "our _ pillars _ are shown as three four - pointed stars , the _ primary spss candidates _ as six - pointed stars , and the _ secondary spss candidates _ as five - pointed stars .",
    "the stars size is proportional to the spss brightness , ranging from v@xmath08 ( largest symbols ) to 15  mag ( smallest symbols ) , approximately . ]    in conclusion , the complexity of the instrument reflects in a complex calibration model , that requires a large set of homogeneously calibrated spss , covering a range of spectral types .",
    "no such database exists in the literature , and new observations are necessary to build it .",
    "the gaia photometric calibration model implies specific needs as it comes to _ (",
    "i ) _ the selection criteria of the spss candidates and _ ( ii ) _ the characteristics of their flux tables ( i.e. , their calibrated spectra ) . the derived formal requirements @xcite define both the spss grid and the observing needs and can be summarized as follows :        * spectral resolution r=@xmath14 , i.e. , they should oversample the gaia bp / rp resolution by a factor of 45 at least ; * wavelength coverage : 330010500   , corresponding to the full coverage of the bp and rp spectrophotometers ; * large sample ( approximately 200300 stars ) , covering different spectral types , although a large fraction should consist in hot stars , as featureless as possible ; * magnitude range 9@xmath5v@xmath515  mag : when observed by gaia they should ensure an end - of - mission s / n@xmath0100 over most of the wavelength range , without saturating ; * typical uncertainty on the absolute flux , with respect to the assumed calibration of vega @xcite of @xmath03% , excluding small troubled areas in the spectral range ( telluric bands residuals , extreme red and blue edges ) , where it can be somewhat worse ; * very homogeneous data treatment and quality , i.e. , the spss flux tables should have @xmath01% internal precision ; * photometric stability within @xmath15  mmag , necessary to ensure the above accuracy and precision .    the calspec @xcite and the @xcite databases are very good starting points ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for further references ) , but new observations are needed .",
    "it is clear that if we add the requirements deriving from a ground - based campaign to the above ones , it becomes very difficult to assemble the grid in a relatively short time .",
    "therefore we decided to proceed in steps .",
    "the link between vega and our spss will be ensured by three _ pillars _",
    "( section  [ sec - pillars ] ) ; these will enable to calibrate the _ primary spss _",
    "( section  [ sec - primaries ] ) , our ground - based calibrators spread over the whole sky .",
    "the primary spss will in turn enable to calibrate our _ secondary spss _",
    "( section  [ sec - secondaries ] ) , which constitute the actual gaia grid , together with the eligible _ primaries_. the basic principles of our calibration strategy were first outlined by @xcite .",
    "the sky distribution of our candidates is shown in figure  [ fig_sky ] , while the magnitude and spectral type distributions are shown in figure  [ fig_hist ] .",
    "more details on the selection criteria , sources , and candidate lists can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our three pillars are the calspec pillars and were selected from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they are the da ( pure hydrogen atmosphere ) white dwarfs ( wd ) named g  191-b2b , gd  71 , and gd  153 , three well known and widely used standards .",
    "a fourth star from @xcite , hz  43 , was excluded from our list because it is member of a binary system .",
    "its companion , a dme star @xcite , at a distance of @xmath03@xmath15 , is brighter longward of @xmath07000  @xcite , and therefore not usable in our ground - based campaign , where the actual seeing ranges from @xmath00.5 `` up to @xmath162 '' in some cases and the slit width is 10``-12 '' for our spectra .",
    "the flux calibrated spectra of the _ pillars _ , available in the calspec database , are tied to the revised vega flux , and their flux calibrations are based on the comparison of wd model atmosphereserg @xmath17 s@xmath6 @xmath6 at 5556   . ] and spectra obtained with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) aboard hst .",
    "the _ pillars _ are in the temperature range @xmath18  k and the fos spectrophotometry agrees with the model fluxes to within 2% over the whole uv - visible range . in addition , the simulated b and v magnitudes of the data agree to better than 1% with the landolt photometry @xcite .",
    "some of the most recent literature measurements for the three _ pillars _ are listed in table  [ tab_pillars ] .",
    ".pillars[tab_pillars ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "[ sec - rej ]    we discuss in the following sections some preliminary results of our survey : a few interesting cases of problematic candidates are described , and a list of notable rejected spss candidates can be found in table  [ tab_rej ] ; two stars showed variability larger than @xmath15  mmag in our short - term constancy monitoring .",
    "identification problems are common , especially when large databases are automatically matched ( as done within simbad , for example ) , and when stars have large proper motions .",
    "we found our first case when a discrepancy became evident between the ltt  377 literature spectrum @xcite and our observed spectrum , which was more consistent with an f type rather than the expected k spectral type .",
    "we contacted the simbad and eso staff , because their sites reported the information from @xcite as well , and we concluded that the eso standard was not ltt  377 , but another star named cd  -34  241 , of spectral type f. this was confirmed by older literature papers like @xcite , where ltt  377 was identified as cd  -34  239 , and by literature proper motions and coordinates .",
    "we could trace back the error to @xcite , where the wrong association was probably done for the first time , and then propagated down to simbad and eso .",
    "the correct identification of both stars is shown in figure  [ fig_ids1 ] ( left panel ) and [ fig_wd1148 ] were created with the eso skycat tool and images from the digitized sky survey .",
    "skycat was developed by eso s data management and very large telescope ( vlt ) project divisions with contributions from the canadian astronomical data center ( cadc ) . ] .",
    "we decided to keep both stars in our candidates lists ( see tables  [ tab_primaries ] and [ tab_secondaries ] ) .",
    "a similar case was wd  0204 - 306 for which we obtained an unexpectedly red spectrum .",
    "we traced literature identifications back to @xcite , who correctly identified wd  0204 - 306 as associated with lp  885 - 23 ( an m star ) in a binary system , with a separation of 73 \" . at some point",
    ", the two stars got confused and in simbad wd  0204 - 306 ( a white dwarf ) was cross - identified with lp  885 - 23 ( an m star ) . given the reported distance between the two stars , we identified wd  0204 - 306 as lp  885 - 22 , as shown in figure  [ fig_ids1 ] . also in this case , having observations of both stars , we kept both in our _ secondary spss candidates_. the mistake was reported to the simbad staff and now the database is corrected .",
    "a more critical example was wd  1148 - 230 ( figure  [ fig_wd1148 ] ) , having very different coordinates in the @xcite catalogue ( coming from * ? ? ? * and reporting r.a.=11:50:38.8  h and dec=23:20:34  deg ) and in simbad .",
    "the simbad coordinates were from the 2mass catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reporting r.a.=11:50:06.09  h and dec=23:16:14.0  deg ) .",
    "magnitudes were also significantly different . unlike in the previous cases ,",
    "we had insufficient literature information to confirm one or the other identification , so we decided to reject this spss candidate , although we suspect that the mistake resides in the simbad automatic association between wd  1148 - 230 by @xcite and the 2mass catalogue .",
    "finally , we report on the case of wd  2256 + 313 , which was reported to have v=13.96  mag @xcite , but when observed in san pedro mrtir appeared to be much fainter than that ( and of uncertain spectral type , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , possibly with v@xmath1615  mag , so was removed from our candidates list .      in a few cases candidates that appeared relatively isolated on the available finding charts turned out to be in a crowded area where no aperture photometry or reliable wide slit spectroscopy could be performed from the ground , or showed previously unseen companions .",
    "generally , stars with high proper motion could appear isolated in some past finding chart , but later moved too close to another star to be safely observed from the ground .",
    "one example of candidate which appeared relatively isolated judging from the @xcite finding charts , but turned out to be in a crowded field when observed at san pedro mrtir was wd  1911 + 135 , that was promptly rejected , together with wd  1943 + 163 and wd  2046 + 396 .",
    "examples of candidates showing the presence of previously unknown and relatively bright companions were wd  0406 + 592 and wd  2058 + 181 ( figure  [ fig_crowd ] ) .",
    "these stars do not have a particularly high proper motion , and appeared easy to identify on the corresponding finding charts , so we did not expect them to show close visual companions , when observed from the tng and san pedro mrtir , respectively . both stars were rejected .",
    "our auxiliary campaign started giving results as far as the short - term constancy monitoring ( 12  h ) is concerned .",
    "the ability of one lightcurve to detect magnitude variations is measured using the spread of reference star s magnitude differences .",
    "these appear as 1 , 2 , and 3  @xmath19 limits in figure  [ fig_var ] , where we present the differential lightcurves our only _ confirmed _ variable star .    1 , 2 , and 3",
    "@xmath19 variations are marked with dotted lines . ]",
    "star 1740346 , one of the currently used calspec standards and one of our _ primary spss _ candidates , showed variability with an amplitude of 10  @xmath1  0.8  mmag in b band when observed with bfosc@cassini in loiano , on 1 september 2010 ; with dolores@tng , on 31 september 2009 ; and with bfosc@cassini , on 26 may 2009 .",
    "the variability period is 50  min , approximately , thus showing properties typical of @xmath2  scuti variables .",
    "a preliminary determination of 1740346 parameters can be found in @xcite , using literature data and stellar models , resulting in a mass of @xmath01.3  m@xmath20 , an effective temperature of @xmath08300  k , and a distance of @xmath0750  pc .",
    "these parameters are also compatible with a @xmath2  scuti type star .",
    "we are gathering detailed follow - up observations and a complete characterization of star 1740346 will be the subject of a forthcoming paper ( marinoni et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the differential lightcurve is presented in figure  [ fig_var ] ( top panel ) .",
    "we have described a large ( more than 400 nights ) ground - based survey which started in 2007 and is expected to end in 20132014 , aimed at building a grid of spss for the flux calibration of gaia spectra and magnitudes . the technical complexity of gaia requires a large ( @xmath0200 ) set of spss flux tables , calibrated in flux with high precision ( @xmath01% ) and accuracy ( @xmath03% with respect to vega ) , and covering a range of spectral types .",
    "spss candidates need to be monitored for constancy ( within @xmath15  mmag ) to ensure the quoted precision in the final calibration .",
    "we discussed the adopted calibration strategy , the selection requirements and a list of candidate spss .",
    "a brief overview of the adopted data reduction and analysis procedures was also presented , and more details will be discussed in a series of future papers dealing with all technical aspects , data products , photometric catalogues , flux tables , and lightcurves .",
    "some preliminary results were presented , showing the data quality , a few problematic cases of candidate spss that were rejected because of identification problems , close companions , and variability . in particular , we detected a new variable star , a calspec standard which is most probably a @xmath2 scuti variable ; follow - up observations for its characterization are ongoing .",
    "all data products will be eventually made public together with each gaia data release , within the framework of the dpac ( data processing and analysis consortium ) publication policies . at the moment",
