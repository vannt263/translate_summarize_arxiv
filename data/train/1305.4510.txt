    "a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 quantizes quark dynamics in directions transverse to @xmath1 , leading to discretized landau levels .",
    "the quarks do not explicitly depend on transverse momenta , and may be regarded as quasi - two dimensional .",
    "an energy splitting between levels is @xmath2 , and each level has a degeneracy proportional to @xmath3 . in particular",
    ", the degeneracy in the lowest landau level ( lll ) allows more quarks to stay at low energy for larger @xmath1 , so more effects on non - perturbative dynamics @xcite .",
    "they affect chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , gluon polarization ( or sea quark effects ) @xcite , and also meson structures @xcite and their dynamics @xcite .",
    "quenched @xcite as well as full lattice calculations @xcite show that the chiral condensate depends linearly on @xmath4 at @xmath5 .",
    "this likely indicates the mass gap of a quark in the lll to be nearly @xmath1-independent at large @xmath1 @xcite , unlike the qed case with the electron mass gap of @xmath6 .",
    "this linear rising behavior and deviations from chiral effective model predictions start to occur at @xmath7 @xcite , beyond which non - perturbative methods at microscopic level seem to be required .",
    "the landau level quantization is only an approximate concept , because gluons couple to different landau levels . at small @xmath8 ,",
    "the different landau levels are close in energies , and are easily mixed by soft gluons accompanying large @xmath9 . in this situation , we should instead use effective theories for hadrons , regarding @xmath10 as a small expansion parameter @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the landau levels are widely separated at large @xmath11 , and then discussions based on the landau levels are supposed to be the useful starting point .",
    "there is an expansion parameter , @xmath12 , and because each of the landau levels has a characteristic spatial wavefunction in transverse directions , there naturally arise @xmath1-dependent _ form factor effects _ , with which soft gluons decouple from the hopping process of a quark from one to another _",
    "orbital _ level . this feature can be used to set up a framework , designed to analyze perturbative effects separately from non - perturbative ones .",
    "our ultimate goal will be to understand non - perturbative phenomena at strong @xmath1 , and for this purpose it is most important to study quarks in the lll by applying some non - perturbative methods .",
    "but for such analyses , we need to prepare renormalized parameters which concisely summarize effects from all higher landau levels ( hlls ) , plus effective operators made of the lll fields . they are generated from diagrams having the lll fields as external legs ( we will impose some particular gauge fixing that will be also used in non - perturbative analyses for consistent treatments ) .",
    "below we present the first step / part of such a program .",
    "most of the computations can be done within perturbation theory , thanks to the aforementioned form factor effects .",
    "the perturbative framework is convenient to write down the renormalized parameters at finite @xmath1 , because we can easily relate them to the @xmath13 ones for which many perturbative results are available @xcite . in this way all the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences can be handled .",
    "meanwhile , a coupling within the same _ orbital _ levels is exceptional and is beyond the scope of the perturbative framework : the lll and the first landau level with spin anti - parallel to that of the lll can couple via soft gluons , because these landau levels actually belong to the same orbital level , @xmath14 . but even in that case , a semi - perturbative framework is applicable : because a quark in the first landau level is hard , operator product expansion ( ope ) can be used to deal with soft gluons @xcite , in terms of local matrix elements of gluonic operators with perturbative coefficients of @xmath15 .",
    "the results for the ope will be presented elsewhere .    as a first step of our program",
    ", we shall compute 1-loop perturbative contributions from all higher _ orbital _ levels to the renormalized quark self - energy of the lll , that will be the input for non - perturbative analyses . in the renormalization procedure",
    ", it is essential to separate the lll intermediate states to avoid large logarithms associated with the dimensional reduction , @xmath16 @xcite . unlike the @xmath13 case",
    ", such an infrared ( ir ) enhancement can not be removed by simply imposing the renormalization condition at large external momenta .",
    "this is part of the reason to use a renormalization group ( rg ) approach of the wilsonian type in which we integrate out only hard modes .",
    "our results should be also insensitive to the magnetic catalysis whose main actors are quarks in the lll .",
    "our usage of the rg differs from the previous rg studies in its motivation . in the previous studies",
    ", the rg methods were used to investigate the non - perturbative aspects of qed or the 4-fermi interaction models for qcd @xcite , which were intended to capture some _ universal _ aspects of fermions in strong magnetic fields . there",
    "the rg was mainly applied to non - perturbative lll dynamics of such models .",
    "in contrast , our present study is _ not _ for non - perturbative aspects : considering difficulties in the first principle treatments of non - perturbative gluon dynamics , we will _ not _ apply the rg to the lll dynamics to which the non - perturbative gluons couple in a vital way .",
    "we shall only investigate when and how the lll dominance over the hlls can be a good description , by applying the rg only to the hlls and hard gluons .",
    "the virtue of our approach is that , as far as @xmath4 is large enough , the method of rg can be combined with systematic ( semi-)perturbative treatments of qcd in a model - independent way . even within perturbative treatments ,",
    "a number of interesting conclusions can be derived . in particular",
    ", it is possible to examine the range of @xmath4 where the perturbation theory is safely applied , and , within such a domain , one can argue when higher orbital contributions are negligible .",
    "remarkable outputs in this work is that the higher orbital levels cease to strongly affect the lll already at a rather small value , @xmath17 , due to small @xmath9 appearing in the functional integration of the higher orbital levels . beyond such value of @xmath4",
    ", the lowest orbital level approximation for non - perturbative phenomena seems to be well justified .",
    "by adding the quark - gluon coupling , @xmath48 is still a good quantum number , but the landau level index @xmath47 is not . again expanding quark fields in the ritus bases , a gluon field is convoluted with a form factor function , @xmath49 the form factor naturally arises because each orbital level has a characteristic spatial wavefunction in transverse directions .",
    "it decides which gluons , soft or hard , are relevant for each process .",
    "the phase factor has a property @xmath50 under exchanges @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which will be frequently used in the computation .",
    "there are four types of vertices : the first two conserve spins and couple only to @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 and the others flip spins and couple only to @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 note that the spin flipping vertices couple fields with @xmath59 and @xmath60 components .",
    "in particular , @xmath56 kicks out fields in the lll to the hlls , so processes involving @xmath56 are suppressed by @xmath61 .",
    "thus only @xmath62 and @xmath53 become relevant at low energy .    for later convenience ,",
    "we discuss properties of @xmath63 . its general form is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the generalized laguerre polynomial , and the complex variables are @xmath66 we are interested in the coupling between the lll and hlls , and we frequently use the relation @xmath67 with @xmath68 .    these expressions suggest that , for a hopping between different orbital levels , @xmath36 and @xmath69 , we have to convolute the form factor function accompanying powers of transverse momenta , @xmath70 or @xmath71 , which dies out for small @xmath72 ( see fig.[fig : formfactor ] ) .",
    "these powers suppress the ir contributions of the gluon propagator , so for @xmath73 we can avoid soft gluons and apply weak coupling methods for hard gluons .",
    "this observation is the base for our perturbative framework .     which will be used in the quark self - energy calculations .",
    "there the form factor is convoluted with the gluon propagator .",
    "the location of the maximum is @xmath74 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the form factor suppresses the soft gluons , and this effect becomes stronger at larger @xmath76 . ]",
    "now we use the feynman rules in the ritus bases to compute the higher orbital level contributions to the lll quark self - energy . to deal with the uv divergence arising from summation of all higher orbital levels , we use the renormalized perturbation theory with counter terms which are determined in the @xmath13 case . since the lll kinetic term does not have @xmath77 , we will use the self - energy expression at @xmath13 for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the renormalized and bare self - energies , respectively ) , @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are counter terms at scale @xmath84 to force the renormalized self - energy to vanish at @xmath85 ( renormalization condition ) .",
    "it is implicit that @xmath86 depends on @xmath84 only through renormalized parameters , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , etc . for the self - energy at finite @xmath1",
    ", we must use the same counter terms as the @xmath13 case . replacing the counter terms by @xmath89 through ( [ rvac ] ) ,",

    "one might wonder why we also split the vacuum piece into @xmath14 and the others .",
    "indeed , this is not a mandatory step .",
    "however , by adjusting the phase space for each of @xmath13 and @xmath100 terms explicitly , trivial @xmath1-dependence coming from phase space mismatch can be avoided for each term , and we can extract out genuine @xmath1-dependent contributions for each phase space .",
    "this helps qualitative interpretations .",
    "also , it becomes easier to see which renormalization scale should be taken to avoid the logarithmic enhancement typical in perturbation theory ( see eq.([deltasigma ] ) ) .",

    "<S> a wilsonian renormalization group approach is applied , in order to include effects of the higher landau levels for quarks into a set of renormalized parameters for the lowest landau level ( lll ) , plus a set of operators made of the lll fields . </S>",
    "<S> most of the calculations can be done in a model - independent way with perturbation theory for hard gluons , thanks to _ form factors _ of quark - gluon vertices that arise from the ritus bases for quark fields . as a part of such renormalization program , we compute the renormalized quark self - energy at 1-loop , including effects from all higher _ orbital _ levels . </S>",
    "<S> the result indicates that the higher orbital levels cease to strongly affect the lll at a rather small magnetic field of @xmath0 . </S>"
