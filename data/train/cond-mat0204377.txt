    "this explains a continuous interest in its properties .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian reads @xmath6 here @xmath7 @xmath8 are annihilation ( creation ) operators of an electron with spin @xmath9 , @xmath10 in the wannier representation at the lattice site @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 is the hopping integral between different lattice sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath0 is the intrasite coulomb repulsion .",
    "the bloch conduction band energy @xmath17 is given by    @xmath18    in the following we restrict ourselves to the simple cubic ( sc ) lattice and assume that    @xmath19 then    @xmath20    the hopping parameter @xmath3 is simply related to the bandwidth @xmath21 of the bloch band ( 2 ) , e. g. @xmath22 for the sc lattice@xmath23 the interplay between the two model parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath24 is decisive for the properties of the model resulting in strong electron correlations , leading to band magnetism ( see e.g. refs [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] for a review ) , insulator - to - metal transition ( see e.g. refs [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] and papers cited therein ) and high-@xmath25 superconductivity ( negative @xmath0-model , see e.g. ref . [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the hubbard model very often plays also a role of a submodel for many other more complicated models ( as e.g. anderson model ( see ref . [ 6 ] ) , s - f model ( see refs [ 7,8 ] ) and so on ) .",
    "especially interesting , but difficult to handle are the properties of the hubbard model in such a regime of the model parameters where the bandwidth @xmath21 is comparable to the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 . in a large number of papers [ 9 - 30 ] the authors tried to solve this model using many sophisticated methods .",
    "the exact solution , however , does not exist till now .",
    "many authors tried to change the situation in this field by introducing the expansion parameter @xmath2 @xmath26 .",
    "this idea ( cf refs [ 31,32 ] ) consists in replacing  difficult physics  connected with the model by",
    " difficult mathematics  obtained by a laborious expansion with respect to @xmath27 different methods connected with this problem have been applied as e.g. the perturbation expansion ( see refs [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] ) , canonical transformation ( see refs [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ) or ab initio derivations ( see refs [ 25 ] , [ 28 - 30 ] ) .",
    "most of the methods , leading to the @xmath28 model ( or generalized @xmath1 model ) are also summarized in refs [ 27 ] , [ 4 ] .",
    "the goal of the present paper is just to show that we can take another , nonperturbative way . in the first step we divide the crystal lattice into a set of interacting dimers . in other words",
    ", we can rewrite the hubbard hamiltonian ( 1 ) for the sc lattice ( see fig .",
    "1 ) in the equivalent form:[multiblock footnote omitted ]    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    the indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 enumerate the dimers and @xmath33 is the dimer hamiltonian .",
    "the second term in ( 4 ) describes the hopping between nearest dimers in the @xmath34-direction , the third one represents the hopping between nearest dimers ( ( @xmath35)-plane ) and between different dimer planes ( see fig .",
    "the equivalent form of the hubbard hamiltonian ( 4 ) is especially suitable because we can apply in the following the exact solution of the dimer problem ( 5 ) . in the next step",
    "we express the construction operators @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) as linear combinations of the transition operators between different dimer states .",
    "this , in turn , allows to find the exact dimer representation of the whole hamiltonian ( 4 ) .",
    "the space of the dimer eigenvectors consists , however , of two subspaces .",
    "one of them corresponds to the lowest lying energy levels , the second one contains the levels with energies which in the large @xmath0 limit take on large , positive values .",
    "these levels in a reasonable temperature range can not be occupied by electrons and therefore we can exclude them from further considerations .",
    "it is interesting to note that this approch , without any additional assumptions , applied to the dimer hamiltonian ( 5 ) produces the analogy of the well known @xmath1 model ( cf refs [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] ) .",
    "a similar approach can be applied to the hamiltonian ( 4 ) , describing the crystal as a whole . by eliminating from the considerations the unoccupied dimer energy levels in the large @xmath0 limit ( it is the only assumption ) with the use of the projection technique we can find in a straightforward way the final form of the hamiltonian in this limit without using perturbation expansion or canonical transformation .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian , obtained in this way , is very complicated .",
    "it , however , explicitly shows all possible magnetic , nonmagnetic or more complex competitive interaction processes very deeply hidden in the original hamiltonian written in the site representation ( 1 ) .",
    "it is the aim of this paper just to reveal these important but normally invisible elementary interactions .",
    "one important advantage might be that a given approach to the unsolvable hubbard problem can be tested with respect to the types of neglected interaction processes .",

    "the subspace , belonging to @xmath46 and @xmath47 is 1-dimensional ( @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "there are , however , two 2-dimensional subspaces corresponding to @xmath52 ( as e.g. @xmath53 @xmath54 etc . ) and two 2-dimensional subspaces corresponding to @xmath55 ( as e.g. @xmath56 @xmath57 etc . ) .",
    "the subspace , belonging to @xmath58 consists of one 4-dimensional subspace ( as e.g. @xmath59 @xmath60 etc . ) and two 1-dimensional subspaces ( @xmath61 @xmath62 ) .",
    "the complete set of the eigenvalues @xmath63 and eigenvectors @xmath44 of the hubbard dimer is given in the appendix a. it allows to express the dimer hamiltonian ( 5 ) in the equivalent form    @xmath64    the next important step in our calculations is the possibility to express the annihilation operators @xmath65 as linear combinations of transition operators between dimer states @xmath66 this procedure can easily be performed when acting with the annihilation operators on the basis vectors ( 6 ) and using the reciprocal relations to ( a.1 ) . in this way we can obtain the dimer representation of the annihilation ( creation ) operators , given in appedix b. after this operation we can insert so prepared @xmath38 @xmath67 into the hubbard hamiltonian ( 4 ) to obtain the hubbard model in the dimer representation for the sc lattice .",
    "this representation will be used later to derive the hubbard hamiltonian in the large @xmath0 limit ( see sec .",
    "looking at the eigenvalues ( a.1 ) of the hubbard dimer it is easy to see that for large @xmath0 @xmath68 the energies @xmath69 and @xmath70 take on large , positive values , producing in the partition function the terms which can practically be neglected .",
    "it means that the mentioned energies are not occupied in the reasonable temperature range ( @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 ) and can be excluded from our considerations .",
