    "all studies of snr maps assume classic mhd and test - particle theory of acceleration . though they neglect effects of the back - reaction of the efficiently accelerated particles , they are able to explain general properties of the distribution of the surface brightness in radio , x - rays and @xmath0-rays .",
    "this is because the classic theory , in contrast to the non - linear one , is able to deal with oblique shocks , that is vital for synthesis of snr images .    at present , the theory which considers effects of accelerated particles on the shock and on acceleration itself is developed for the initially quasi - parallel shocks only .",

    "i , we introduced a method to derive an aspect angle of ismf from the radio brightness of snr . in paper ii , we synthesized radio and ic @xmath0-ray maps and concluded that coincidence of the position of the @xmath0-ray and radio limbs is not a common case in theoretical models , because different parameters are dominant in determintion of the radio and @xmath0-ray brightness variations . on the other hand , radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray observations @xcite",
    "show that radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray limbs coincide in sn 1006 .",
    "as discussed in paper ii , such coincidence might be attributed to a combination of obliquity dependences of magnetic field and properties of emitting particles , as well as orientation versus the observer .    in the present paper",
    ", we make a step forward extending our model of non - thermal leptonic emission of sedov snrs in uniform medium to the x - ray band .",
    "we also derive brightness profiles for representative parameters which are suited for the comparison with adiabatic snrs .",

    "the use of analytical solutions allows us to reduce the computational time considerably .",
    "we follow @xcite also in calculation of the evolution of the distribution function @xmath1 of relativistic electrons downstream of the shock ( see appendix [ xmaps : app2 ] for details ) .",
    "the ismf orientation versus observer is described by the aspect angle @xmath2 , an angle between ismf and the line of sight .",
    "let us define also the obliquity angle @xmath3 as the angle between ismf and the normal to the shock , and the azimuth angle @xmath4 in the projection plane which is measured from the direction of the component of ismf in the plane of the sky ( see fig .  1 in paper ii ) .",
    "the compression factor for ismf at the shock front @xmath5 is modulated from unity at parallel shock to @xmath6 at perpendicular one ( where @xmath0 is the adiabatic index ) , in agreement with @xcite .    at the shock ,",

    "the variation of the distribution @xmath1 over the surface of the snr and its evolution downstream of the shock are calculated as described by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we synthesize the synchrotron and ic emission , considering each of the three cases of variation of electron injection efficiency with the shock obliquity ( quasi - perpendicular , isotropic , and quasi - parallel particle injection ) and each of the three alternatives for time and spatial dependence of @xmath8 ( time - limited , loss - limited and escape - limited with a gyrofactor @xmath17 as a parameter ; it is a ratio of the mean free path of a particle to its gyroradius ) .",
    "both the synchrotron and the ic losses are included as channels for the radiative losses of relativistic electrons , though the ic losses are quite small comparing to synchrotron due to large mf considered .",
    "the surface brightness is calculated by integrating emissivities along the line of sight within the snr .",
    "the emissivity of electrons is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the photon energy and @xmath20 is the spectral distribution of synchrotron or ic radiation power of electron .",

    "the pattern of synchrotron x - ray brightness of snr is in general similar to the radio one . in most cases , the bright x - ray limbs or other features",
    "are located in the same azimuth as in the radio images .",
    "the only differences appear due to radiative losses which modify downstream distribution of the electrons emitting in x - rays ( thus the features of brightness are radially thinner ) and due to variation of @xmath8 over the snr surface . in the radio",
    "( see fig .  4 in paper ii ) as also in the x - ray band , the remnant shows two symmetric bright lobes ( for @xmath22 ) in all the injection models with the maxima in surface brightness coincident in the two bands .",
    "the maxima are located at perpendicular shocks in the quasi - perpendicular and isotropic models ( i.e. where @xmath21 is higher ) , and at parallel shocks in the quasi - parallel model ( i.e. where emitting electrons are only presented ) .",

    "in the case of quasi - perpendicular injection , the morphology is bilateral ( two lobes ) for large aspect angles ( @xmath23 , i.e. the component of ismf in the plane of the sky is larger than that along the line of sight ) and almost ring - like for low aspect angles ( @xmath24 ; see fig .",

    "this happens because the non - thermal x - ray emission originates from a very thin shell behind the shock making the effect of limb brightening in x - rays more important than in the radio band .",
    "in addition , we note that centrally bright x - ray ( and radio ) snrs are expected to be much fainter than bilateral snrs ( see lower panels in fig .  [ xmaps : fig3 ] ) and consequently much more difficult to be observed . the above considerations may affect the statistical arguments generally invoked against the quasi - parallel injection ( i.e. the fact that this model produces morphology which is not observed ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
