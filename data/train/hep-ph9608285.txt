    "the core of the standard model @xcite of particle physics is easily displayed in a single figure , here figure 1 .",
    "there are gauge groups @xmath0 for the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the gauge bosons associated with these groups are minimally coupled to quarks and leptons according to the scheme depicted in the figure .",
    "the non - abelian gauge bosons within each of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 factors also couple , in a canonical minimal form , to one another . the @xmath3 group is spontaneously broken to the @xmath4 of electromagnetism .",
    "this breaking is parameterized in a simple and ( so far ) phenomenologically adequate way by including an @xmath0 @xmath5 scalar ` higgs ' field which condenses , that is has a non - vanishing expectation value in the ground state .",
    "condensation occurs at weak coupling if the bare ( mass)@xmath6 associated with the higgs doublet is negative .",
    "the fermions fall into five separate multiplets under @xmath7 , as depicted in the figure .",
    "the color @xmath1 group acts horizontally ; the weak @xmath2 vertically , and the hypercharges ( equal to the average electric charge ) are as indicated .",
    "note that left- and right - handed fermions of a single type generally transform differently .",
    "this reflects parity violation .",
    "it also implies that fermion masses , which of course connect the left- and right - handed components , only arise upon spontaneous @xmath3 breaking .",
    "only one fermion family has been depicted in figure 1 ; of course in reality there are three repetitions of this scheme . also not represented are all the complications associated with the masses and cabibbo - like mixing angles among the fermions .",
    "these masses and mixing angles are naturally accommodated as parameters within the standard model , but i think it is fair to say that they are not much related to its core ideas  more on this below .    with all these implicit understandings and discrete choices ,",
    "the core of the standard model is specified by three numbers  the universal strengths of the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions . the electromagnetic sector , qed , has been established as an extraordinarily accurate and fruitful theory for several decades now .",
    "let me now briefly describe the current status of the remainder of the standard model .",
    "-.50 in 0.75 in    some recent stringent tests of the electroweak sector of the standard model are summarized in figure 2 . in general",
    "each entry represents a very different experimental arrangement , and is meant to test a different fundamental aspect of the theory , as described in the caption .",
    "there is precisely one parameter ( the mixing angle ) available within the theory , to describe all these measurements .",
    "as you can see , the comparisons are generally at the level of a per cent accuracy or so . over all",
    ", the agreement appears remarkably good , especially to anyone familiar with the history of weak interactions .",
    "it is so good , that if the small but significant residual discrepancies in the branching ratios @xmath8 and @xmath9 survive further scrutiny , one will certainly prefer to interpret them as an indication of some peculiar additional physics , rather than as a breakdown of the fundamental principles behind the @xmath3 theory . indeed , there are some reasonably attractive concrete possibilities along these lines @xcite .",
    "-.7 in 0.75 in    some recent stringent tests of the strong sector of the standard model are summarized in figure 3 @xcite .",
    "again a wide variety of very different measurements are represented , as indicated in the caption .",
    "a central feature of the theory ( qcd ) is that the value of the coupling , as measured in different physical processes , will depend in a calculable way upon the characteristic energy scale of the process .",
    "the coupling was predicted  and evidently is now convincingly measured  to decrease as the inverse logarithm of the energy scale : asymptotic freedom .",
    "again , all the experimental results must be fit with just one parameter  the coupling at any single scale , usually chosen as @xmath10 .",
    "as you can see , the agreement between theory and experiment is remarkably good .",
    "the accuracy of the comparisons is at the few per cent level .",
    "-.65 in = 3.5 in    let me emphasize that these figures barely begin to do justice to the evidence for the standard model .",
    "several of the results in them summarize quite a large number of independent measurements , any one of which might have falsified the theory .",
    "for example , the single point labeled ` dis ' in figure 3 describes literally hundreds of measurements in deep inelastic scattering with different projectiles and targets and at various energies and angles , which must  if the theory is correct  all fit into a tightly constrained pattern .",
    "the central theoretical principles of the standard model have been in place for nearly twenty - five years . over this interval",
    "the quality of the relevant experimental data has become incomparably better , yet no essential modifications of these venerable principles has been required .",
    "let us now praise the standard model :    @xmath11 the standard model is here to stay , and describes _ a lot_.    since there is quite direct evidence for each of its fundamental ingredients ( _ i.e_. its interaction vertices ) , and since the standard model provides an extremely economical packaging of these ingredients , i think it is a safe conjecture that it will be used , for the foreseeable future , as the working description of the phenomena within its domain .",
    "and this domain includes a very wide range of phenomena  indeed not only what dirac called `` all of chemistry and most of physics '' , but also the original problems of radioactivity and nuclear interactions which inspired the birth of particle physics in the 1930s , and much that was unanticipated .",
    "@xmath11 the standard model is a _ principled _ theory .",
    "indeed , its structure embodies a few basic principles : special relativity , locality , and quantum mechanics , which lead one to quantum field theories , local symmetry ( and , for the electro weaksector , its spontaneous breakdown ) , and renormalizability ( minimal coupling ) .",
    "the last of these principles , renormalizability , may appear rather technical and perhaps less compelling than the others ; we shall shortly have occasion to re - examine it in a larger perspective . in any case , the fact that the standard model is principled in this sense is profoundly significant : it means that its predictions are precise and unambiguous , and generally can not be modified ` a little bit ' except in very limited , specific ways .",
    "this feature makes the experimental success especially meaningful , since it becomes hard to imagine that the theory could be approximately right without in some sense being exactly right .",
    "@xmath11 the standard model _ can be extrapolated_.    specifically because of the asymptotic freedom property , one can extrapolate using the standard model from the observed domain of experience to much larger energies and shorter distances .",
    "indeed , the theory becomes simpler  the fundamental interactions are all effectively weak  in these limits .",
    "the whole field of very early universe cosmology depends on this fact , as do the impressive semi - quantitative indications for unification and supersymmetry i shall be emphasizing momentarily .",
    "just because it is so comprehensive and successful , we should judge the standard model by demanding criteria .",
    "it is clearly an important part of the truth ; the question becomes : how big a part ?",
    "critical scrutiny reveals several important shortcomings of the standard model :    @xmath11 the standard model contains scattered multiplets with peculiar hypercharge assignments .    while little doubt can remain that the standard model is essentially correct , a glance at figure 1 is enough to reveal that it is not a complete or final theory .",
    "the fermions fall apart into five lopsided pieces with peculiar hypercharge assignments ; this pattern needs to be explained .",
    "also the separate gauge theories , which are quite mathematically and conceptually similar , are fairly begging to be unified .",
    "@xmath11 the standard model supports the possibility of strong p and t violation @xcite .",
    "there is a near - perfect match between the necessary ` accidental ' symmetries of the standard model , dictated by its basic principles as enumerated above , and the observed symmetries of the world .",
    "the glaring exception is that there is an allowed  gauge invariant , renormalizable  interaction which , if present , would induce significant violation of the discrete symmetries @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the strong interaction .",
    "this is the notorious @xmath14 term .",
    "@xmath14 is an angle which _ a priori _ one might expect to be of order unity , but in fact is constrained by experimental limits on the neutron electric dipole moment to be @xmath15 . this problem can be addressed by postulating a sort of quasi - symmetry ( peccei - quinn @xcite symmetry ) , which roughly speaking corresponds to promoting @xmath14 to a dynamical variable  a quantum field .",
    "the quanta of this field @xcite , _ axions _ , provide an interesting dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "other possibilities for explaining the absence of strong @xmath12 and @xmath13 violation have been proposed , but they require towers of hypotheses which seem ( to me ) quite fragile .",
    "i would like to emphasize , since it came up at the conference , that in no way should the absence of strong @xmath12 and @xmath13 violation be taken as evidence against qcd itself . for practical purposes",
    ", one can take the @xmath14 parameter to be fixed phenomenologically .",
    "one finds it to be very small  and is done with it !",
    "@xmath11 the standard model does not address family problems .",
    "there are several distinct ` family problems ' , ranging from the extremely qualitative ( digital ) to the semi - qualitative ( some very small numbers and distinctive patterns ) to the straightforward but most challenging goal of doing full justice to experience by computing ( analog ) experimental numbers with controlled , small fractional errors :    why are there three repeat families ?",
    "rabi s famous question regarding the muon ",
    "`` who ordered _ that _ ? ''  still has no convincing answer .",
    "how does one explain the very small electron mass ?",
    "the dimensionless coupling associated with the electron mass , that is its strength of yukawa coupling to the higgs field , is about @xmath16 .",
    "it is almost as small as the limits on the @xmath14 angle ( suggesting , perhaps , that strong p and t violation is just around the corner ? ) .",
    "this question can of course be generalized  all the fermion masses , with one exception , are sufficiently small to beg qualitative explanation .",
    "the exception , of course , is the @xmath17 quark .",
    "it is a fascinating possibility that roughly the observed value of @xmath17 quark mass at low energies might result after running from a wide range of fundamental couplings at a high scale @xcite .",
    "if so , one would have a satisfactory qualitative explanation of the value of this parameter .",
    "why do the weak currents couple approximately in the order of masses ?",
    "that is , light with light , heavy with heavy , and intermediate with intermediate .",
    "why are the mixings what they are  small , but not miniscule ? the same , for the cp violating phase in the weak currents ( parameterized invariantly by jarlskog s @xmath18 ) @xcite ?  and , by the way , are we sure that @xmath19 ? and so on ...    @xmath11 the standard model does not allow non - vanishing neutrino masses .",
    "this is the only entry on my list that has a primarily _ experimental _ motivation . at present",
    "there are three quite different experimental hints for non - vanishing neutrino masses : the solar neutrino problem @xcite , the atmospheric neutrino problem @xcite , and the los alamos oscillation experiment @xcite .",
    "the standard model in its conventional form does not allow non - zero neutrino masses .",
    "however i would like to mention that only a very minimal extension of the theory is necessary to accommodate such masses .",
    "one can add a complete @xmath20 singlet fermion @xmath21 to the model .",
    "@xmath21 can be given , consistent with all symmetries and with the requirement of renormalizability , a majorana mass @xmath22 .",
    "note especially that such a mass does not violate @xmath3 .",
    "likewise , @xmath21 can have a yukawa coupling to the to the ordinary lepton doublets through the higgs field .",
    "then condensation of the higgs field activates the `` see - saw '' mechanism @xcite to give a small mass for the observed neutrinos ; with @xmath23 a range of experimentally and perhaps cosmologically interesting neutrino masses can be accommodated .",
    "@xmath11 gravity is not included in the standard model .",
    "this really represents ( at least ) two logically separate problems .",
    "first there is the ultraviolet problem , the notorious non - renormalizability of quantum gravity .",
    "this provides an appropriate context , in which to introduce the modern perspective toward the whole concept of renormalizability .",
    "suppose that one were naive , and simply added the einstein lagrangian for general relativity to the standard model , of course coupling the matter fields appropriately ( minimally ) . following feynman and",
    "many others one could derive , formally , the perturbation series for any physical process",
    ". one would find , however , that , the integrals over closed loops generally diverges at the high - energy ( ultraviolet ) end .",
    "indeed the graviton coupling has , in units where @xmath24 , dimensions of @xmath25 so that in expanding about flat space one must take @xmath26 in order to obtain a properly normalized quadratic kinetic term for @xmath27 . ] . here",
    "@xmath28 is a measure of the stiffness of space - time .",
    "thus higher and higher order terms will , on dimensional grounds , introduce higher and higher factors of the ultraviolet cutoff to compensate .",
    "however if we fix ( by notional experiments ) the couplings at a given scale @xmath29 and calculate corrections by only including energy - momenta between the scale @xmath30 of interest and @xmath31 , the successive terms in perturbation theory will be accompanied by positive powers of @xmath32 and will be small .",
    "thus we can , for example , consistently set all non - minimal couplings to zero at any chosen energy - momentum scale well below the planck scale .",
    "they will then be negligible for all practically accessible scales . for different choices of the scale they will be different , but since they are negligible this hardly matters .",
    "this procedure is , in practice , the one we always adopt  and the standard model peacefully coexists with gravity , so long as we refuse to consider @xmath33 .",
    "however from this perspective a second problem looms larger than ever .",
    "the energy ( and negative pressure ) density of matter - free space , the notorious cosmological term , occurs as the coefficient @xmath34 of the identity term in the action : @xmath35 .",
    "it has dimensions of ( mass)@xmath36 , and on phenomenological grounds we must suppose @xmath37 .",
    "the question is : where does such a tiny scale come from ?",
    "what is so special about the present state of the universe , that the value of the effective @xmath34 for it , which one might naively expect to reflect contributions from much higher scales , is so effectively zeroed ?",
    "there may also be problems with forming a fully consistent quantum theory even of low - energy processes involving black holes @xcite .",
    "finally i will mention a question that i think has a rather different status from the foregoing , although many of my colleagues would put it on the same list , and maybe near the top :    the standard model begs the question `` _ why _ does @xmath3 symmetry break ? '' .",
    "to me , this is an example of the sort of metaphysical question that could easily fail to have a meaningful answer .",
    "there is absolutely nothing wrong , logically , with the classic implementation of the higgs sector as described earlier .",
    "nevertheless , one might well hunger for a wider context in which to view the existence of the higgs doublet and its negative ( mass)@xmath6  or a suitable alternative .",
    "each of the deficiencies of the standard model mentioned in the previous section has provoked an enormous literature , literally hundreds or thousands of papers .",
    "obviously i can not begin to do justice to all this work . here",
    "i shall concentrate on the first question , that of deciphering the message of the scattered multiplets and peculiar hypercharges . among our questions",
    "this one has so far inspired the most concrete and compelling response  a story whose implications range far beyond the question which inspired it .",
    "given that the strong interactions are governed by transformations among three color charges  say rwb for red , white , and blue  while the weak interactions are governed by transformations between two others  say gp for green and purple  what could be more natural than to embed both theories into a larger theory of transformations among all five colors ? this idea has the additional attraction that an extra u(1 ) symmetry commuting with the strong su(3 ) and weak su(2 ) symmetries automatically appears , which we can attempt to identify with the remaining gauge symmetry of the standard model , that is hypercharge . for while in the separate su(3 ) and",
    "su(2 ) theories we must throw out the two gauge bosons which couple respectively to the color combinations r+w+b and g+p , in the su(5 ) theory we only project out r+w+b+g+p , while the orthogonal combination ( r+w+b)-@xmath38(g+p ) remains .",
    "georgi and glashow @xcite originated this line of thought , and showed how it could be used to bring some order to the quark and lepton sector , and in particular to supply a satisfying explanation of the weird hypercharge assignments in the standard model .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the five scattered su(3)@xmath39su(2)@xmath39u(1 ) multiplets get organized into just two representations of @xmath40 .",
    "it is an extremely non - trivial fact that the known fermions fit so smoothly into @xmath40 multiplets .",
    "@xmath41 : 2 different color labels ( antisymmetric tensor )    @xmath42    @xmath43 : 1 anticolor label    @xmath44 # 1    in all the most promising unification schemes , what we ordinarily think of as matter and anti - matter appear on a common footing . since the fundamental gauge transformations do not alter the chirality of fermions , in order to represent the most general transformation possibilities one should use fields of one chirality , say left , to represent the fermion degrees of freedom . to do this , for a given fermion , may require a charge conjugation operation .",
    "also , of course , once we contemplate changing strong into weak colors it will be difficult to prevent quarks and leptons from appearing together in the same multiplets .",
    "generically , then , one expects that in unified theories it will not be possible to make a global distinction between matter and anti - matter and that both baryon number @xmath45 and lepton number @xmath46 will be violated , as they definitely are in @xmath40 and its extensions .    as shown in figure 4",
    ", there is one group of ten left - handed fermions that have all possible combinations of one unit of each of two different colors , and another group of five left - handed fermions that each carry just one negative unit of some color .",
    "( these are the ten - dimensional antisymmetric tensor and the complex conjugate of the five - dimensional vector representation , commonly referred to as the `` five - bar '' . )",
    "what is important for you to take away from this discussion is not so much the precise details of the scheme , but the idea that _ the structure of the standard model , with the particle assignments gleaned from decades of experimental effort and theoretical interpretation , is perfectly reproduced by a simple abstract set of rules for manipulating symmetrical symbols_. thus for example the object rb in this figure has just the strong , electromagnetic , and weak interactions we expect of the complex conjugate of the right - handed up - quark , without our having to instruct the theory further .",
    "if you ve never done it i heartily recommend to you the simple exercise of working out the hypercharges of the objects in figure 4 and checking against what you need in the standard model  after doing it , you ll find it s impossible ever to look at the standard model in quite the same way again .    although it would be inappropriate to elaborate the necessary group theory here , i ll mention that there is a beautiful extension of @xmath40 to the slightly larger group @xmath47 , which permits one to unite all the fermions of a family into a single multiplet @xcite .",
    "in fact the relevant representation for the fermions is a 16-dimensional spinor representation .",
    "some of its features are depicted in figure 5 .",
    "the 16th member of a family in @xmath47 , beyond the 15 familiar degrees of freedom with a standard model family , has the quantum numbers of the right - handed neutrino @xmath21 as discussed above .",
    "this emphasizes again how easy and natural is the extension of the standard model to include neutrino masses using the see - saw mechanism .    0.75 in -.15 in @xmath48 @xmath49    @xmath50 @xmath51",
    "we have seen that simple unification schemes are successful at the level of _ classification _ ; but new questions arise when we consider the dynamics which underlies them .",
    "part of the power of gauge symmetry is that it fully dictates the interactions of the gauge bosons , once an overall coupling constant is specified .",
    "thus if su(5 ) or some higher symmetry were exact , then the fundamental strengths of the different color - changing interactions would have to be equal , as would the ( properly normalized ) hypercharge coupling strength .",
    "in reality the coupling strengths of the gauge bosons in su(3)@xmath39su(2)@xmath39u(1 ) are observed not to be equal , but rather to follow the pattern @xmath52 .",
    "fortunately , experience with qcd emphasizes that couplings `` run '' .",
    "the physical mechanism of this effect is that in quantum field theory the vacuum must be regarded as a polarizable medium , since virtual particle - anti - particle pairs can screen charge .",
    "thus one might expect that effective charges measured at shorter distances , or equivalently at larger energy - momentum or mass scales , could be different from what they appear at longer distances .",
    "if one had only screening then the effective couplings would grow at shorter distances , as one penetrated deeper insider the screening cloud .",
    "however it is a famous fact @xcite that due to paramagnetic spin - spin attraction of like charge vector gluons @xcite , these particles tend to _ antiscreen _ color charge , thus giving rise to the opposite effect ",
    "asymptotic freedom  that the effective coupling tends to shrink at short distances .",
    "this effect is the basis of all perturbative qcd phenomenology , which is a vast and vastly successful enterprise , as we saw in figure 3 .    for our present purpose of understanding the disparity of the observed couplings ,",
    "it is just what the doctor ordered .",
    "as was first pointed out by georgi , quinn , and weinberg @xcite , if a gauge symmetry such as su(5 ) is spontaneously broken at some very short distance then we should not expect that the effective couplings probed at much larger distances , such as are actually measured at practical accelerators , will be equal .",
    "rather they will all have have been affected to a greater or lesser extent by vacuum screening and anti - screening , starting from a common value at the unification scale but then diverging from one another at accessible accelerator scales .",
    "the pattern @xmath52 is just what one should expect , since the antiscreening or asymptotic freedom effect is more pronounced for larger gauge groups , which have more types of virtual gluons .",
    "the marvelous thing is that the running of the couplings gives us a truly quantitative handle on the ideas of unification , for the following reason . to fix the relevant aspects of unification ,",
    "one basically needs only to fix two parameters : the scale at which the couplings unite , which is essentially the scale at which the unified symmetry breaks ; and their value when then unite . given these ,",
    "one calculates three outputs : the three _ a priori _ independent couplings for the gauge groups su(3)@xmath39su(2)@xmath39u(1 ) of the standard model .",
    "thus the framework is eminently falsifiable .",
    "the miraculous thing is , how close it comes to working ( figure 6 ) .",
    "= 3.5 in -0.75 in 0.50 in    the unification of couplings occurs at a very large mass scale , @xmath53 . in the simplest version",
    ", this is the magnitude of the scalar field vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks su(5 ) down to the standard model symmetry su(3)@xmath39su(2)@xmath39u(1 ) , and is analogous to the scale @xmath54 for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the largeness of this large scale mass scale is important in several ways .",
    "@xmath55 it explains why the exchange of gauge bosons that are in su(5 ) but not in su(3)@xmath39su(2)@xmath39u(1 ) , which re - shuffles strong into weak colors and generically violates the conservation of baryon number , does not lead to a catastrophically quick decay of nucleons .",
    "the rate of decay goes as the inverse fourth power of the mass of the exchanged gauge particle , so the baryon - number violating processes are predicted to be far slower than ordinary weak processes , as they had better be .",
    "@xmath55 @xmath56 is significantly smaller than the planck scale @xmath57 at which exchange of gravitons competes quantitatively with the other interactions , but not ridiculously so .",
    "this indicates that while the unification of couplings calculation itself is probably safe from gravitational corrections , the unavoidable logical next step in unification must be to bring gravity into the mix .",
    "@xmath55 finally one must ask how the tiny ratio of symmetry - breaking mass scales @xmath58 required arises dynamically , and whether it is stable .",
    "this is the so - called gauge hierarchy problem , which we shall discuss in a more concrete form a little later .    the success of the gqw calculation in explaining the observed hierarchy @xmath52 of couplings and the approximate stability of the proton is quite striking .",
    "in performing it , we assumed that the known and confidently expected particles of the standard model exhaust the spectrum up to the unification scale , and that the rules of quantum field theory could be extrapolated without alteration up to this mass scale  thirteen orders of magnitude beyond the domain they were designed to describe .",
    "it is a triumph for minimalism , both existential and conceptual .",
    "however , on further examination it is not quite good enough .",
    "accurate modern measurements of the couplings show a small but definite discrepancy between the couplings , as appears in figure 6 . and heroic dedicated experiments to search for proton decay did not find it @xcite ; they currently exclude the minimal su(5 ) prediction @xmath59 by about two orders of magnitude .    given the scope of the extrapolation involved ,",
    "perhaps we should not have hoped for more .",
    "there are several perfectly plausible bits of physics that could upset the calculation , such as the existence of particles with masses much higher than the electroweak but much smaller than the unification scale . as virtual particles",
    "these would affect the running of the couplings , and yet one certainly can not exclude their existence on direct experimental grounds .",
    "if we just add particles in some haphazard way things will only get worse : minimal su(5 ) nearly works , so the generic perturbation from it will be deleterious .",
    "this is a major difficulty for so - called technicolor models , which postulate many new particles in complicated patterns .",
    "even if some _ ad hoc _ prescription could be made to work , that would be a disappointing outcome from what appeared to be one of our most precious , elegantly straightforward clues regarding physics well beyond the standard model .",
    "fortunately , there is a theoretical idea which is attractive in many other ways , and seems to point a way out from this impasse .",
    "that is the idea of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is a symmetry that extends the poincare symmetry of special relativity ( there is also a general relativistic version ) . in a supersymmetric theory",
    "one has not only transformations among particle states with different energy - momentum but also between particle states of different _",
    "spin_. thus spin 0 particles can be put in multiplets together with spin @xmath60 particles , or spin @xmath60 with spin 1 , and so forth .",
    "supersymmetry is certainly not a symmetry in nature : for example , there is certainly no bosonic particle with the mass and charge of the electron . more generally if one defines the @xmath61-parity quantum number @xmath62 which should be accurate to the extent that baryon and lepton number",
    "are conserved , then one finds that all currently known particles are @xmath61 even whereas their supersymmetric partners would be @xmath61 odd .",
    "nevertheless there are many reasons to be interested in supersymmetry , and especially in the hypothesis that supersymmetry is effectively broken at a relatively low scale , say @xmath63 1 tev . anticipating this for the moment ,",
    "let us consider the consequences for running of the couplings .",
    "the effect of low - energy supersymmetry on the running of the couplings was first considered long ago @xcite , well before the discrepancy described above was evident experimentally .",
    "one might have feared that such a huge expansion of the theory , which essentially doubles the spectrum , would utterly destroy the approximate success of the minimal su(5 ) calculation .",
    "this is not true , however .",
    "to a first approximation since supersymmetry is a space - time rather than an internal symmetry it does not affect the group - theoretic structure of the calculation .",
    "thus to a first approximation the absolute rate at which the couplings run with momentum is affected , but not the relative rates .",
    "the main effect is that the supersymmetric partners of the color gluons , the gluinos , weaken the asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction .",
    "thus they tend to make its effective coupling decrease and approach the others more slowly .",
    "thus their merger requires a longer lever arm , and the scale at which the couplings meet increases by an order of magnitude or so , to about 10@xmath64 gev .",
    "also the common value of the effective couplings at unification is slightly larger than in conventional unification ( @xmath65 _ versus _",
    "@xmath66 ) .",
    "this increase in unification scale significantly reduces the predicted rate for proton decay through exchange of the dangerous color - changing gauge bosons , so that it no longer conflicts with existing experimental limits .    upon more careful examination",
    "there is another effect of low - energy supersymmetry on the running of the couplings , which although quantitatively small has become of prime interest .",
    "there is an important exception to the general rule that adding supersymmetric partners does not immediately ( at the one loop level ) affect the relative rates at which the couplings run .",
    "this rule works for particles that come in complete su(5 ) multiplets , such as the quarks and leptons ( which , since they do nt upset the full su(5 ) symmetry , have basically no effect ) or for the supersymmetric partners of the gauge bosons , because they just renormalize the existing , dominant effect of the gauge bosons themselves .",
    "however there is one peculiar additional contribution , from the supersymmetric partner of the higgs doublet .",
    "it affects only the weak su(2 ) and hypercharge u(1 ) couplings .",
    "( on phenomenological grounds the su(5 ) color triplet partner of the higgs doublet must be extremely massive , so its virtual exchange is not important below the unification scale .",
    "_ why _ that should be so , is another aspect of the hierarchy problem . )",
    "moreover , for slightly technical reasons even in the minimal supersymmetric model it is necessary to have two different higgs doublets with opposite hypercharges .",
    "the net effect of doubling the number of higgs fields and including their supersymmetric partners is a sixfold enhancement of the asymmetric higgs field contribution to the running of weak and hypercharge couplings .",
    "this causes a small , accurately calculable change in the calculation . from figure 7",
    "you see that it is a most welcome one . indeed , in the minimal implementation of supersymmetric unification",
    ", it puts the running of couplings calculation right back on the money @xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in -.75 in 0.65 in    since the running of the couplings with scale is logarithmic the unification of couplings calculation is not terribly sensitive to the exact scale at which supersymmetry is broken , say between 100 gev and 10 tev .",
    "( to avoid confusion later let me specify that at this point what i mean by the scale at which supersymmetry is broken is the characteristic mass splitting between supersymmetric partners in a minimal extension of the standard model .",
    "later we shall use the term in a different sense , as referring to the largest splitting between supersymmetric partners in the entire world - spectrum ; this could be much larger , and indeed in popular models it almost invariably is .",
    "this ambiguous terminology is endemic in the literature ; fortunately , the meaning is usually clear from the context . )",
    "there have been attempts to push the calculation further , in order to address this question of the supersymmetry breaking scale , but they are controversial . for example , comparable uncertainties arise from the splittings among the very large number of particles with masses of order the unification scale , whose theory is poorly developed and unreliable .",
    "superstring theory suggests @xcite many possible ways in which the simple calculation described here might go wrong ; if we take the favorable result of this calculation at face value , we must conclude that none of them happen .    in any case",
    ", if we are not too greedy the main points still shine through :    @xmath11 if supersymmetry is to fulfill its destiny of elucidating the hierarchy problem in a straightforward way , then the supersymmetric partners of the known particles can not be much heavier than the su(2)@xmath39u(1 ) electroweak breaking scale ,  they should not be beyond the expected reach of lhc .",
    "@xmath11 if we assume this to be the case then the meeting of the couplings takes place in the simplest minimal models of unification , to adequate accuracy , without further assumption .",
    "this is a most remarkable and non - trivial fact .",
    "the preceding result , taken at face value , has extremely profound implications :    @xmath11 quantum field theory , and specifically its characteristic vacuum polarization effects leading to asymptotic freedom and running of the couplings , continue to work quantitatively up to energy scales many orders of magnitude beyond where they were discovered and established .",
    "i would like to emphasize also some negative implications of this : there are things that might have , but do _ not _ , happen .",
    "it might have happened that the known particles are some complicated composites of more elementary objects , or that many additional strong couplings appeared at higher energies ( technicolor ) , or that additional dimensions became dynamically active , or that particle physics simply dissolved into some amorphous mess .",
    "unless figure 7 is a cruel joke on the part of mother nature , none of this happens , or at least the complications are in a strong , precise sense walled off from the standard model and the dynamical evolution of its couplings .",
    "@xmath11 supersymmetry , in its virtual form , has already been discovered .",
    "this provides , in my opinion , a very good specific reason to be hopeful about the future of experimental particle physics at the high - energy frontier .",
    "@xmath11 you will notice that we have made progress in uniting the gauge bosons with each other , and the various quarks and leptons with each other , but not the gauge bosons with the quarks and leptons .",
    "it takes supersymmetry  perhaps spontaneously broken  to make this feasible .",
    "@xmath11 supersymmetry was invented in the context of string theory , and seems to be necessary for constructing consistent string theories containing gravity ( critical string theories ) that are at all realistic .",
    "@xmath11 most important for our purposes , supersymmetry can help us to understand the vast disparity between weak and unified symmetry breaking scales mentioned above .",
    "this disparity is known as the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "it actually raises several distinct problems , including the following . in calculating radiative corrections to",
    "the ( mass)@xmath6 of the higgs particle from diagrams of the type shown in figure 8 one finds an infinite , and also large , contribution . by this",
    "i mean that the divergence is quadratic in the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "no ordinary symmetry will make its coefficient vanish .",
    "if we imagine that the unification scale provides the cutoff , we find that the radiative correction to the ( mass)@xmath6 is much larger than the final value we want .",
    "( if the higgs field were composite , with a soft form factor , this problem might be ameliorated . following",
    "that road leads to technicolor , which as mentioned before seems to lead us far away from our best source of inspiration . ) as a formal matter one can simply cancel the radiative correction against a large bare contribution of the opposite sign , but in the absence of some deeper motivating principle this seems to be a horribly ugly procedure .",
    "now in a supersymmetric theory for any set of virtual particles circulating in the loop there will also be another graph with their supersymmetric partners circulating .",
    "if the partners were accurately degenerate , the contributions would cancel .",
    "otherwise , the threatened quadratic divergence will be cut off only at virtual momenta such that the difference in ( mass)@xmath6 between the virtual particle and its supersymmetric partner is relatively negligible .",
    "thus we will be assured adequate cancelation if and only if supersymmetric partners are not too far split in mass  in the present context , if the splitting is not much greater than the weak scale .",
    "this is ( a crude version of ) the most important _ quantitative _ argument which suggests the relevance of `` low - energy '' supersymmetry .",
    "-.75 in = 3.5 in    @xmath11 supersymmetric field theories have many special features , which make them especially interesting , and perhaps promising , phenomenologically .",
    "i can not be very specific about this here , both because there are as yet no canonical models and because the subject is excessively technical , but let me just mention some appropriate concepts : radiative @xmath3 breaking associated with the heavy top quark ; doublet - triplet splitting mechanisms ; approximate flat directions for generating large mass hierarchies .",
    "supersymmetric models also have additional mechanisms for neutral flavor - changing processes and cp violation , which in generic models are dangerously large , but in appropriate models can be suppressed down to a level which is interesting  but not _ too _ interesting  experimentally .",
    "theoretical control over the many new parameters that arise even in minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model is not adequate to guide one through a bewildering number of choices that substantially affect the predictions for observable phenomena .",
    "recently a class of models that potentially enjoy much greater predictive power has been identified @xcite .",
    "the leading idea of these models is that the fundamental breaking of supersymmetry occurs in a `` hidden sector '' and is characterized by a scale @xmath67 .",
    "this breaking is supposed to be conveyed to our observable sector , including the minimal supersymmetric standard model , by a specific , highly symmetric interaction term ) having the quantum numbers @xmath68 under @xmath40 .",
    "these fields are assumed to acquire supersymmetry breaking masses through their couplings to a standard model singlet field @xmath69 which develops vacuum expectation values along its scalar as well as its @xmath70components .",
    "explicit models where this occurs dynamically have been constructed @xcite .",
    "typically these models contain the superpotential couplings @xmath71 which generates a non  supersymmetric spectrum for the @xmath72 fields through @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath72 fields , through their standard model gauge interactions , induce susy breaking masses for the r - odd scalars @xmath74 ) and gauginos ( @xmath75 . ] .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the situation in a class of models , commonly referred to as supergravity models , that has been much more popular . in supergravity models",
    "the fundamental symmetry breaking scale is @xmath76 , and the hidden sector communicates with the observable sector by gravitational - strength interactions .",
    "a decisive phenomenological difference between these classes of models arises because of the different role played by the gravitino @xmath77 , which is essentially the nambu - goldstone fermion of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking .",
    "its mass is generically given as @xmath78 , whereas its couplings to ordinary matter scale as @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "in supergravity models the gravitino is massive and very weakly coupled , and although it could be significant cosmologically , it plays no very direct role in ordinary phenomenology . in the messenger models with a ( relatively ) much lower supersymmetry breaking scale the gravitino is exceedingly light , and although its couplings are very feeble they can be such as to cause the next lightest , photino - like particle @xmath80 to decay via @xmath81 within a distance that might be difficult to resolve experimentally @xcite . generically , then , in these models one will find that pair - production of supersymmetric ( r - odd ) particles will lead eventually , perhaps after a cascade of decays , to final states containing @xmath82 and missing energy @xcite .",
    "the recent observation @xcite of a dramatic event with a final state containing hard @xmath83 and missing transverse energy by the cdf collaboration therefore lends special interest to these models .",
    "one can work out the consequences of a minimal implementation of a low - energy messenger model for supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "outstanding features of this model include : generic production of final states including @xmath82 and missing energy ; clean separation of scales in the r - parity odd spectrum , with the squarks and gluinos much heavier than the electroweak gauginos and sleptons ; and very small mixing of the @xmath3 neutralinos with higgsinos and with each other .",
    "many specific features are predicted in terms of very few parameters , so that the model could be rigorously tested , or eliminated , with quite a small amount of relevant data .",
    "if the cdf @xmath83 event represents a first indication , such data is not far beyond current reach .    of course in insisting upon an absolutely minimal model we may be over reaching .",
    "some apparent difficulties with the minimal model are removed upon careful treatment of coupling renormalization and proper inclusion of d - terms ; nevertheless , one must remain open to such possibilities as different overall mass scales for the sleptons as against the gauginos , or additional contributions to the parameters of the higgs sector .",
    "finally let me briefly mention another possibility for physics capable of generating the cdf @xmath83 event , which if nothing else might serve as a useful foil .",
    "if there were heavy pion - like particles whose decay modes were dominantly @xmath84 and @xmath85 , their production and decay could induce many of the same final states as we have analyzed above , including the cdf event .",
    "the missing energy in this event would be carried off by neutrinos ; but in other cases one might have @xmath86 without significant missing energy , so that this alternative will be readily distinguishable @xcite .",
    "these considerations are meant mainly to illustrate how very important it is , in our present state of ignorance , to obtain some guidance from experiment .",
    "a few informative events could re - shape our ideas on particle physics and cosmology in fundamental ways .",
    "for example , if something like the minimal messenger model of supersymmetry breaking were established , we would learn that the lightest r - odd particle is the gravitino , and that it is extremely light . in that case",
    "planned experiments to detect a cosmological background of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) would be doomed to frustration .",
    "now i would like to draw out from this discussion of particle physics some morals for cosmology .",
    "@xmath11 it makes good sense to extrapolate toward the _ very _ early universe .    as figure 3 shows us in hard data , the strong coupling runs toward a small effective value at high energy .",
    "figure 6 , and especially figure 7 , emphasize why the seductive assumption that in crucial respects particle physics remains simple and weakly coupled up to extraordinarily high energies is very hard to resist , because it leads to a strikingly successful account of the unification of couplings .",
    "thus fundamental particle physics becomes profoundly simpler ( though superficially more complex ) toward the earliest moments of the big bang .",
    "the scale for the running of inverse couplings , once they are large , is logarithmic .",
    "this feature naturally connects mass scales identifiable in particle physics experiments with exponentially ( in the inverse couplings ) larger scales .",
    "numerically , as we have seen , one is lead in this way close to the planck scale .",
    "thus there is direct , though of course extremely limited , evidence that quantum field theory at weak coupling governs the interactions of the known particles up to energies ( temperatures , densities ) nearly as high as one could reasonably hope .",
    "@xmath11 cosmic phase transitions happened .",
    "since qcd and asymptotic freedom are firmly established , we can say with complete confidence that the effective low - energy degrees of freedom in the strong interaction  hadrons with confined color and spontaneously broken chiral symmetry  are quite different from the fundamental colored quark and gluon degrees of freedom which manifest themselves at high temperature .",
    "the transition between them must be accompanied by a rapid crossover and perhaps by a phase transition .",
    "indeed , the existence of a phase transition can be rigorously established in models closely related to real - world qcd , such as the variant of qcd where the @xmath87 or the pure - glue theory .",
    "the nature of the transition , perhaps surprisingly , seems to depend sensitively upon the spectrum of light quarks .",
    "the behavior of qcd at high temperatures is in principle , and to some extent in practice , calculable . the qcd crossover or transition that occurred during the big bang is even in some rough sense _",
    "reproducible _ , and will be approximated in future relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "similarly , since the electroweak @xmath88 breaking pattern is firmly established , there is an excellent chance that another phase transition , associated with @xmath3 restoration at high temperature , occurs .",
    "it is not guaranteed that there is a strict phase transition , since there is no gauge - invariant order parameter for the higgs phase , though at weak coupling one certainly expects a sharp transition .",
    "one of the most interesting projects for future accelerators , which has have important implications for cosmology , will be to map out the relevant parameters so that we can characterize this crossover or transition .",
    "these ` established ' examples encourage one to speculate about the possibility of phase transitions associated with unification , or perhaps occurring in some hidden sector .",
    "cosmological phase transitions have many possible consequences for the history of the universe and for observational cosmology , including :    _ defects _ of all sorts , including textures , strings , and monopoles that could persist even to the present day .",
    "truly stable domain walls must be avoided or inflated away , but appropriately long - lived ones could be important in the prior evolution of the universe .",
    "_ inflation _ , if one gets trapped in a metastable condition by a barrier or by weakness of the relevant coupling that drives the transition .",
    "_ gravity waves _ , if the scale of the transition is high or if the transition is sufficiently violent .",
    "_ baryogenesis _ , under the same qualitative conditions . of course",
    ", baryogenesis does not require a phase transition .",
    "it will be fascinating to discover which , if any , of these possibilities is realized by the electroweak transition .",
    "there is also a great opportunity , if one can establish compelling , sufficiently detailed models for unification , or a hidden sector , or ... , to examine their cosmological implications . in particular , as was repeatedly emphasized in these dialogues , we need better models of , or alternatives to , inflation .",
    "@xmath11 we have specific , credible dark matter candidates , notably the lightest r - odd particle ( lsp ) and the axion .",
    "@xmath11 we have rich material for fantasies .",
    "i will leave to each of you the joy of choosing his or her own favorite fantasies from among the many we have heard , or of inventing new ones .",
    "i would however like briefly to conclude by alluding a circle of ideas which though it can be made to sound quite fantastic i think is actually deeply implicit in much current thinking about particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the axion is perhaps the most well - motivated and studied exemplar of a family of related fields including familons , dilatons , and moduli fields that in one way or another embody the idea that what we ordinarily consider ` constants ' might not be fundamental parameters fixed in the very formulation of the laws of nature , but rather can be considered usefully as dynamical entities . in a theory with only one fundamental , dimensional , parameter , such as superstring theory appears to be , there is clearly a sense in which all dimensionless couplings are dynamical variables .",
    "they might nevertheless behave effectively as constants either if it costs a very large energy - density to excite them at all ( _ e.g_. massive fields ) or if ordinary matter couples very weakly to long - wavelength fluctuations of the field ( _ e.g_. stiff light fields with derivative couplings ) .    in the latter case",
    "one might anticipate long - range forces mediated by the exchange of the field @xcite .",
    "i believe that experiments to look for such forces are among the most fundamental which can presently be attempted .",
    "they address in a concrete way the question : are the constants of nature uniquely determined to be what we observe by dynamical laws , or are they ` frozen accidents ' imprinted at the big bang ? or are they presently relaxing towards some more favorable value to about 1 gev , then relaxes towards the dynamically favored , approximately p and t conserving , value . ] ?",
    "note that although a rapidly ( on cosmological time scales ) oscillating field represents non - relativistic matter , a sufficiently slowly varying field might appear as a contribution to the effective cosmological term .    if these ideas are along the right lines , it could be misguided to seek a unique lorentz - invariant ` vacuum ' state as a model for our present world .",
    "one might instead be required , at a fundamental level , to seek the boundary conditions for particle physics from cosmology ( and _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "one could then hope that some single simple , attractive _ ansatz _ would form the basis of both cosmology and particle physics , and truly unify these fundamental sciences .",
    "is it plausible ?",
    "i think that recent developments in string theory , especially in its application to the theory of black holes , are quite encouraging in this regard . in that context one primarily deals with spatially inhomogeneous but essentially stationary ( in time ) configurations .",
    "great insight has been achieved by modeling extremal black holes and other solitons as extended singular surfaces ( d - branes ) @xcite where the conditions for string propagation are modified . a central point worth emphasizing that there is no obvious singularity in directly physical quantities , because there are no pointlike physical objects within the theory capable of probing and resolving the singular mathematical structure directly . at large distances",
    "one has physics which appears to a local observer to be building toward a field - theoretic soliton and spatial geometry with a singular core , but the crisis dissolves into something that can not be described in terms of ordinary fields and spatial geometry .",
    "it ought to be possible to examine the analogous situation for pseudo - singularities occuring at an initial ` time '  which of course would wind up _ not _ being physical time . in this way",
    ", it might be possible to retain the advantages of simplicity and uniqueness inherent in a mathematically singular initial condition , while avoiding any associated physical pathology .",
    "it is conceivable to me that even a very simple initial condition might suffice to generate a region of the universe of sufficient complexity to be identified with our own .",
    "indeed , by analogy with the black hole case one might expect that the ( mathematically ) singular time - origin would look , at sufficient distance so that familiar space - time - matter notions apply , like a sort of universal heat pulse  which perhaps could be identified as the trigger for a hot big bang .",
    "as guth and linde have emphasized to us , such a quasi - thermal starting point can lead , through inflation , to an extremely rich and structured dynamics , including generically the possibility that different spatial regions are governed by different ` laws of physics '  specifically differing with respect to the values of the sorts of moduli fields mentioned above , but also conceivably differing even with respect to effective spatial dimension , gauge groups and family structures , supersymmetry breaking ( or not ) mechanism , and so forth .",
    "physics would then give an essentially historical  but not vague ",
    "account of the world we observe : an account highly constrained but perhaps far from determined by fundamental symmetry and consistency principles .",
    "this would be similar to how biology is constrained , but not determined , by physics .",
    "of course , this meta - proposal for a wave function  or rather initial condition  of the universe is based on quite different physical considerations from that of hartle - hawking @xcite , and probably contradicts it : in particular there is no appeal to euclidean procedures , and the arrow of time is manifest .",
    "my overarching perception , coming out of this set of dialogues , is that the doors to several new worlds are ajar . on the cosmological side",
    ", we can look forward especially to new observational results on the microwave anisotropy .",
    "these will heavily impact the classic questions of homogeneous cosmology ( including the values of hubble parameter @xmath27 , the spatial curvature of the universe , and the cosmological term @xmath34 ) as well as theoretical ideas about primordial fluctuations .",
    "the semi - phenomenological approach to particle physics , emphasized in the body of this talk , leads us to anticipate that there is a wealth of accessible new phenomena whose broad outlines ( i believe ) we can confidently foresee , and whose details will be richly informative on fundamental questions . and there is today rapid ferment in the ` high theory ' of particle physics and quantum gravity , with results of striking novelty and mathematical depth emerging .",
    "the challenge remains , to connect these results with concrete phenomena .",
    "perhaps cosmology offers our best hope for this .",
    "we see narrow shafts of light emerging from behind each door .",
    "in each case , we do not know what is on the other side  whether it is a beautiful habitable world , a labyrinth , or a jungle .",
    "the doors may be heavy , and require elaborate machinery to move them , but we must , and will , push through .",
    "i would like to thank keith dienes for supplying figures 6 and 7 , and especially chris kolda for valuable assistance in the preparation of this manuscript .",
