    "in 2015 september , the advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory (;",
    "@xcite ) made the first direct detection of an astrophysical gravitational - wave ( ) signal that turned out to be from a merger .",

    "some of the most promising astrophysical sources of are also expected to produce broadband emission and neutrinos .",
    "this has created exciting new opportunities for joint broadband observations and multi - messenger astronomy .    in a event , a tight binary comprised of two , two , or a and a experiences a runaway orbital decay due to gravitational radiation . in a binary",
    "including at least one  a or merger  we expect signatures due to energetic outflows at different timescales and wavelengths .",
    "if a relativistic jet forms , we may observe a prompt short lasting on the order of one second or less , followed by x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows of hours to days duration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rapid neutron capture in the sub - relativistic ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) is hypothesized to produce a or macronova , an optical and near - infrared signal lasting hours to weeks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "eventually , we may observe a radio blast wave from this sub - relativistic outflow , detectable for months to years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , several seconds prior to or tens of minutes after merger , we may see a coherent radio burst lasting milliseconds ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in short ,",
    "a binary can produce radiation over a wide range of wavelengths and time scales . on the other hand , in the case of a stellar - mass",
    ", the current consensus is that no significant counterpart emission is expected except for those in highly improbable environments pervaded by large ambient magnetic fields or baryon densities .",
    "the first campaign to find counterparts triggered by low - latency event candidates was carried out with the initial ligo and virgo detectors and several astronomy facilities in 2009 and 2010 @xcite . in preparing for advanced detector operations ,",
    "the ligo and virgo collaborations worked with the broader astronomy community to set up an evolved and greatly expanded follow - up program .",
    "seventy - four groups with access to ground- and space - based facilities joined , of which 63 were operational during .",
    "details of the 2009 to 2010 follow campaign and changes for o1 are given in section  1 of the supplement @xcite .",
    "after years of construction and commissioning , the advanced ligo detectors at livingston , louisiana , and hanford , washington , began observing in 2015 september with about @xmath0 times the distance reach ( @xmath1 times the sensitive volume ) of the earlier detectors .",
    "a strong event was identified shortly after the pre - run calibration process was completed .",
    "deep analysis of this event , initially called g184098 and later given the name gw150914 , is presented in @xcite and companion papers referenced therein . in this paper",
    "we describe the initial low - latency analysis and event candidate selection ( section  [ s : detection ] ) , the rapid determination of likely sky localization ( section  [ s : skymaps ] ) , and the follow - up observations carried out by partner facilities ( sections  [ s : emfollow ]  and  [ s : limits ] ) . for analyses of those observations , we refer the reader to the now - public  circulars and to a number of recent papers .",
    "we end with a brief discussion of counterpart detection prospects for future events .",
    "as configured for , four low - latency pipelines continually search for transient signals that are coincident in the two detectors within the @xmath2ms light travel time separating them .",
    "(; @xcite ) and (; @xcite ) both search for unmodeled bursts @xcite .",
    "gstlal @xcite and (;",
    "@xcite ) search specifically for binary mergers using matched filtering . because waveforms can be precisely computed from general relativity , gstlal and are more sensitive to signals than the burst search pipelines are .",
    "all four detection pipelines report candidates within a few minutes of data acquisition .",
    "ligo conducted a series of engineering runs throughout advanced ligo s construction and commissioning to prepare to collect and analyze data in a stable configuration .",

    "the rest of was to be used to calibrate the detectors , to carry out diagnostic studies , to practice maintaining a high coincident duty cycle , and to train and tune the data analysis pipelines .",
    "calibration was complete by september  12 and was scheduled to begin on september  18 . on 2015",

    "no candidates were reported at this time by the low - latency gstlal and pipelines , ruling out a or merger .    although the candidate occurred before officially began , the ligo and virgo collaborations decided to send an alert to partner facilites because the preliminary estimate satisfied our planned alert threshold of 1month@xmath4 . although we had not planned to disseminate real - time notices before the formal start of",
    ", most of the computing infrastructure was in place .",
    "basic data quality checks were done within hours of gw150914 ; both interferometers were stable and the data stream was free of artifacts @xcite .",
    "a sky map was available 17 minutes after the data were recorded , and a sky map was available after 14hr .",
    "after extra data integrity checks and an update to the server software , these two sky maps were communicated to observing partners in a circular nearly two days after the event occurred ( gcn  ) .",
    "mass estimates were not released in this initial circular , and observers may have assumed the event was associated with a system or a burst ( e.g. , from a nearby core - collapse ; ) .",
    "the knowledge that gw150914 was consistent with a inspiral and merger was only shared later on october  3 ( gcn  ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeline ] shows the chronology of the detection alerts and follow - up observations .",
    "the data were re - analyzed offline with two independent matched - filter searches using a template bank that includes both binary and mergers .",
    "the waveform was confirmed to be consistent with a merger and this information was shared with observers about three weeks after the event ( gcn  ) .",
    "the was evaluated with the data collected through 20 october , reported to be less than 1 in 100 years ( gcn  ; @xcite ) , and ultimately determined to be much lower .",
    "the final results of the offline search are reported in @xcite .",
    "we produce and disseminate probability sky maps using a sequence of algorithms with increasing accuracy and computational cost . here , we compare four location estimates : the prompt and localizations that were initially shared with observing partners plus the rapid localization and the final localization from lalinference .",
    "all four are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] .        performs a constrained estimate of the reconstructed signal on a sky grid @xcite weighted by the detectors antenna patterns @xcite and makes minimal assumptions about the waveform morphology . with two detectors ,",
    "this amounts to restricting the signal to only one of two orthogonal polarizations throughout most of the sky .",
    "performs bayesian inference assuming the signal is a sinusoidally modulated gaussian @xcite . while this assumption may not perfectly match the data , it is flexible enough to produce reliable localizations for a wide variety of waveforms , including signals @xcite",
    ". produces sky maps by triangulating the times , amplitudes , and phases on arrival supplied by all the pipelines @xcite .",
    "was not available promptly because the low - latency searches were not configured for ; the localization presented here is derived from the offline search .",
    "lalinference performs full forward modeling of the data using a parameterized waveform which allows for spins and detector calibration uncertainties @xcite .",
    "it is the most accurate method for cbc signals but takes the most time due to the high dimensionality .",
    "we present the same lalinference map as @xcite , with a spline interpolation procedure to include the potential effects of calibration uncertainties .",
    "the and lalinference maps were shared with observers on 2016  january  13 ( gcn  ) , at the conclusion of the run . since gw150914 is a event , we consider the lalinference map to be the most accurate , authoritative , and _ final _ localization for this event .",
    "this map has a 90% credible region with area 630 deg@xmath5 .",
    "all of the sky maps agree qualitatively , favoring a broad , long section of arc in the southern hemisphere and to a lesser extent a shorter section of nearly the same arc near the equator .",
    "while the majority of s probability is concentrated in the southern hemisphere , a non - trivial fraction of the 90% confidence region extends into the northern hemisphere .",
    "the lalinference sky map shows much less support in the northern hemisphere which is likely associated with the stronger constraints available with full waveforms .",
    "the localization also supports an isolated hot spot near @xmath6 , where the detector responses make it possible to independently measure two polarization components . in this region",
    ", cwb considers signals not constrained to have the elliptical polarization expected from a compact binary merger .",
    "quantitative comparisons of the four sky maps can be found in section 2 of the supplement @xcite .",
    "the main feature in all of the maps is an annulus with polar angle @xmath7 determined by the arrival time difference @xmath8 between the two detectors .",
    "however , refinements are possible due to phase as well as amplitude consistency and the mildly directional antenna patterns of the ligo detectors @xcite .",
    "in particular , the detectors antenna patterns dominate the modulation around the ring for un - modeled reconstructions through a correlation with the inferred distance of the source @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] , the algorithms all infer polar angles that are consistent at the @xmath9 level .",
    "twenty - five participating teams of observers responded to the alert to mobilize satellites and ground - based telescopes spanning 19 orders of magnitude in wavelength . observations and archival analysis started shortly after the candidate was announced , two days after the event was recorded .",
    "most facilities followed tiling strategies based on the and sky maps .",
    "some groups , considering the possibility of a merger or core - collapse , selected fields based on the areal density of nearby galaxies or targeted the ( e.g. , @xcite ) . had the nature of the signal been promptly available , most groups would not have favored local galaxies because s range for mergers is many times larger than that for . fig .",
