    "gamma - ray blazars are characterized by high variability on different timescales . at energies above 30 mev",
    ", variability has been detected on timescales from one day ( e.g. pks  1622@xmath4297 , @xcite ) to one month ( e.g. pks  0208@xmath4512 , @xcite ) .",
    "the flat  spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) ( pks  2251@xmath5158 ; @xmath6 ) was detected by egret in 1992 during an intense flaring episode @xcite when the blazar flux ( @xmath7mev ) was observed to vary within the range @xmath8photons@xmath9s@xmath10 . in 1995 ,",
    "a 2-week egret campaign detected a flux @xmath11 of its historical maximum @xcite .",

    ", it reached @xmath14mag @xcite and it was detected by integral at a flux level of @xmath15photons@xmath9s@xmath10 in the 3200  kev energy band @xcite .",
    "the radio flux began increasing right after the optical flare , and reached a maximum about a year later @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at that time no high instrument was operational .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , simultaneous observations of fsrqs by means of high - energy instruments are crucial to precisely locate the inverse compton peak and to constrain the physical mechanisms operating in agn flares .    in july 2007 , showed significant activity with strong optical flaring episodes ( g. tosti , 2007 , private communication ) , reaching @xmath16magkani/1m / index.html ] .",
    "this time , the recently launched agile satellite was performing its science performance verification phase ( svp ) and devoted a week to the observation of , joining a multi - frequency campaign reacting to the enhanced optical activity    the agile satellite , a mission @xcite of the italian space agency ( asi ) devoted to high - energy astrophysics , is currently the only space mission capable of observing cosmic sources simultaneously in the energy bands 1860  kev and 30  mev  50  gev .",
    "the satellite was launched on 2007 april 23 by the indian pslv - c8 rocket from the satish dhawan space center shar , sriharikota . the agile equatorial orbit ( average height",
    "540 km , inclination angle 2.5 degrees ) is ideal for high - energy observations because of its low - background environment .",
    "after the post - launch commissioning phase ( 2007 may - june ) , agile started its svp .    in this letter we present an analysis of the agile data obtained during the observations .",
    "preliminary results were communicated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results of a multiwavelength campaign on and the theoretical modelling will be presented in a forthcoming paper . throughout this paper",
    "the quoted uncertainties are given at the 1@xmath0 level , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the agile satellite ( m.  tavani et al .  2008a , in preparation ) has a 3-axis attitude stabilization with fixed solar panels . because of the solar panel constraints",
    ", agile must mantain the instrument axis oriented at 90@xmath17 from the sun at all times .",
    "thus , the locus of allowed pointings forms a great circle in the sky . the agile scientific instrument ( m.  tavani et al .  2008b , in preparation ) is very compact and combines four active detectors yielding broad - band coverage from hard x - rays to gamma - rays .",
    "gamma - ray detection is obtained by the combination of a silicon tracker , a mini - calorimeter and an anticoincidence system ; these three detectors form the agile gamma - ray imaging detector ( grid ) .",
    "the silicon tracker @xcite and the on - board trigger logic ( a.  argan et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) are optimized for imaging in the 30  mev  50  gev energy band . a non - imaging csi detector ( mini  calorimeter , mcal ) is positioned under the silicon tracker and is sensitive in the 0.4100  mev energy band @xcite",
    ". a co - aligned coded - mask hard x - ray imager ( sa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ensures simultaneous coverage in the 1860  kev energy band .",
    "a segmented anti - coincidence system ( acs ) made of a plastic shield surrounds all active detectors @xcite .",
    "table  [ 3c454:tab : tab1 ] provides the relevant parameters for both agile imaging detectors ( agile - grid and super - agile ) as computed on the basis of on ground calibrations , grid beam tests , and extensive monte - carlo simulations .    a crucial part of the grid event processing is provided by the on - board data handling unit ( @xcite ; a.  argan et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "the on - ground data processing handles the grid and super - agile data through dedicated software developed by the instrument teams and integrated into an automatic pipeline system at the asi science data center ( asdc ) .",
    "the reduction software runs both at the asdc and at the instrument institutes .",
    "the svp is aimed at testing and optimizing the overall scientific performance of the instrument , including in - flight calibrations . at the time of writing ,",
    "the svp has just been completed , and only a partial analysis of the in - flight calibration data is available , therefore we restrict our analysis to the e@xmath18mev energy range .",
    "however , the successful observations and tests carried out during the commissioning phase allow us to reliably process the data and obtain preliminary scientific results .",
    "at the epoch of the optical flare ( 2007 july 1921 ) the closest pointing position allowed by the solar panel constraints ranged within 35@xmath1740@xmath17 from the source .",
    "because of the remarkably large ( @xmath19sr ) field of view ( fov ) of the grid and the successful detection of the vela pulsar at @xmath20 off - axis obtained during the svp , agile could reliably study despite its large off - axis position .",
    "the observation were performed between 2007 july 24 14:30 ut and 2007 july 30 11:40 ut , for a total pointing duration of @xmath21 days .",
    "level1 agile - grid data were analyzed using the agile standard analysis pipeline .",
    "a first step aligns all data times to terrestrial time ( tt ) and performs preliminary calculations . in a second step , an ad - hoc implementation of the kalman filter technique ( a.  giuliani et al . , 2008 in preparation )",
    "is used for track identification and event direction reconstruction in detector coordinates .",
    "subsequently , a quality flag is assigned to each grid event : ( g ) , ( p ) , ( s ) , and ( l ) , depending on whether it is recognized as a event , a charged particle event , a single - track event , or if its nature is uncertain , respectively .",
    "then , an agile log - file is created , containing all the information relevant to the computation of the exposure and live - time .",
    "a third step creates the agile event files , excluding events flagged as particles .",
    "this step also reconstructs the event direction in sky coordinates .",
    "once the above steps are completed , the agile scientific analysis package can be run .",
    "counts , exposure , and galactic background maps are created with a bin - size of @xmath22 , for @xmath23mev . to reduce the particle background contamination we selected only events flagged as confirmed events ( ` filtercode=5 ` ) , while all events collected during the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) were rejected ( ` phasecode=18 ` ) .",
    "we also rejected all the events whose reconstructed directions form angles with the satellite - earth vector smaller than 80@xmath17 ( ` albrad=80 ` ) , reducing the earth albedo contamination by excluding regions within @xmath24 from the earth limb .",
    "the most recent versions ( ` build-12 ` ) of the calibration files , which will be publicly available at the asdc site , and of the diffuse emission model @xcite were used .    since",
    "a complete analysis of the in - flight calibration is not available , yet , we adopted the following procedure for the flux determination .",
    "we ran the agile maximum likelihood procedure ( alike ) on the whole observing period , in order to obtain a value for the average flux .",
    "we ran alike both on and on a long ( @xmath25days ) set of observations of vela pulsar taken at approximately 23@xmath17 off - axis . since monte - carlo simulations show that the effective area and the point - spread function are similar for off - axis angles in the 25@xmath1735@xmath17 range , we estimated the flux according to @xmath26 where the terms with the alike superscript are derived by alike , while those with the 3eg superscript come from the third egret catalog @xcite .",
    "super - agile observed for a total on - source net exposure time of 250 ks .",
    "the source was observed at an off - axis position varying from @xmath27 to @xmath28 along the sa @xmath29coordinate and from @xmath30 to @xmath31 along the @xmath32coordinate , due to the sun constraints on the agile pointing .",
    "this implies that the source could be observed only by two of the four sa detectors , with imaging capability in only one direction ( @xmath32 ) and an exposed area of about 1/8 of the on - axis value ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the geometry of the fov of the super - agile detector ) .",
    "figure  [ 3c454:fig : map ] shows a gaussian - smoothed counts map ( @xmath33 ) in galactic coordinates integrated over the whole observing period , using the selections described in   [ 3c454:dataanal ] .",
    "the source detection significance is 13.8-@xmath0 as derived from a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "the source detected by the agile  grid is fully consistent with the radio position of , as shown in figure  [ 3c454:fig : contour ] .",
    "the solid curve represents the agile error circle taking into account both statistic and systematic uncertainties , the dot - dashed curve represents the 95% maximum likelihood contour level , while the dotted curve is the third egret catalog 95% error circle ( radius @xmath34 ) .",
    "whilst the agile 95% maximum likelihood contour level has a semi - major axis @xmath35 and a semi - minor axis @xmath36 , the overall agile error circle has a radius @xmath37 .",
    "the distance between the radio position ( square ) and the agile 95% maximum likelihood contour level barycentre ( star ; @xmath38,@xmath39 ) is @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the egret 95% error circle corresponds to the sum of all the pointings towards the source ( vp1234 , april 1991 - october 1995 ) . during this period egret",
    "accumulated 467 counts above 100  mev , while agile , during its 1-week pointing , accumulated 107 counts above 100  mev . the much larger period over which the egret source location was derived explains the relative sizes of the egret and agile error circles . figure  [ 3c454:fig : lcagile ] , panel ( a ) , shows the light - curve at 1-day resolution for photons above 100  mev .",
    "we notice that is detected at a 4-@xmath0 level during almost the whole period on a 1-day timescale ; this clearly indicates strong flaring activity .",
    "the average flux above 100 mev for the whole period is @xmath41 .",
    "the spectral analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the average flux as well as the daily values of the six days were derived according to @xcite .",
    "first , the entire period was analyzed to determine the diffuse gas parameters and then the source flux density was estimated independently for each of six 1-day periods with the diffuse parameters fixed at the values obtained in the first step .",
    "the average flux above 100 mev for the whole period is the highest ever detected from this source , as shown in figure  [ 3c454:fig : lcagile ] , ( b ) .",
    "fitting the grid fluxes to a constant model ( the weighted mean of the 1-day average flux values ) yields @xmath42 for 5 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) ; therefore we can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 97.7% ( @xmath43 ) level .",
    "a more robust assessment of the source behaviour will be possible when the calibrations are finalized .",
    "however , an indication can be seen of a quick flux decay towards the end of the observation .",
    "the source was not detected ( above 5-@xmath0 ) by the super - agile iterative removal of sources ( iros ) applied to the @xmath32 image , in the 2060  kev energy range .",
    "an upper limit to the observed count rate was obtained by a study of the background fluctuations at the position of the source and a simulation of the source and background contributions with iros . assuming a power law spectral shape with photon index @xmath44 ( extrapolated from the spectral fit of the simultaneous swift 0.3 - 10 kev data , whose analysis will be presented elsewhere )",
    ", we find a 3-@xmath0 upper limit of @xmath3 on the average flux from , allowing for a 50% systematic error to take into account the early status of the calibration of the super - agile response .",
    "in this paper we presented the first blazar detection by agile .",
    "previous egret observations and detections of were carried out in different observational conditions ( off - axis angle between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; typical viewing period duration 8 days , with a single long observation lasting approximately 19 days , @xmath45 off - axis ) .",
    "a significant flare was detected in 1992 january - february with a peak level of @xmath47 photons  @xmath9  s@xmath10 followed by a 2-week decreasing trend @xcite .",
    "subsequent egret detections in 1992 april - may confirmed the flux level near @xmath48 photons  @xmath9  s@xmath10 while an observation during 1995 november - december detected a significantly lower flux , near @xmath49 photons  @xmath9  s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the agile detection therefore shows the highest flux ever detected from .",
    "it is remarkable that a fsrq such as is quite active in the high - energy domain over a timescale of 2 decades .",
    "it is at the moment unclear what determines the jet activity and the high - energy emission from the environment close to the massive black hole of . in the egret era , nine blazars were observed to reach a flux ( in units of @xmath50 above 100  mev ) between 100200 , two ( 3c  279 and 1622@xmath4297 ) between 200300 , and two ( 0528@xmath5134 and 1622@xmath4297 ) between 300350 .",
    "thus , our detection of is comparable to the highest fluxes detected so far .    the agile detection of supports the idea that a special class of blazars shows significant activity on timescales of decades that clearly distinguishes them from other blazar candidates that share similar radio , optical , or x - ray properties , but show no emission .",
    "what determines such behaviour , observed in , 3c  279 and similar blazars , is currently unclear .",
    "@xcite find that radio jets of strong blazars seem to have significantly faster median apparent speeds , @xmath51 , than blazars with no emission , @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that sources have larger doppler factors than blazars with no emission .",
    "recently , @xcite found that blazar radio jets appear to have more compact vlba structure than blazars with no emission , contrary to earlier results @xcite wherein the authors reported no clear differences in the jet morphology between loud and quiet blazars . because of its large field of view and relatively flat sensitivity in the energy range , agile can ,",
    "for the first time , simultaneously monitor a large number of known and candidate blazars , both in and in the hard x - ray energy bands .",
    "this will make it possible to study in detail the apparent dichotomy in the blazar population between loud and quiet sources .",
    "moreover , blazar light - curves can now be monitored on timescales of the order of 3 weeks , allowing us to perform long - term variability studies both in the high - energy range , and correlated with the optical band .",
    "this will be crucial in investigating correlations and time delays between optical flares and emission .",
