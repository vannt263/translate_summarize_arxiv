    "the floer cohomology associated to a generic time - dependent hamiltonian on a compact symplectic manifold is a version of morse cohomology for the symplectic action functional on the loop space @xcite .",
    "the cochains in this theory are formal combinations of fixed points of the time - one hamiltonian flow while the coboundary operator counts hamiltonian - perturbed pseudoholomorphic cylinders . when well - defined , floer cohomology is independent of the choice of hamiltonian and can be used to estimate the number of fixed points as in the conjecture of arnold .    in order to construct the theory one must compactify the moduli spaces of floer trajectories by allowing pseudoholomorphic spheres , and",
    "unfortunately because of the multiple cover problem these moduli spaces can never be made regular in certain circumstances . in algebraic geometry",
    "there is now an elegant approach to this counting issue carried out in a sequence of papers by behrend - manin @xcite , behrend - fantechi @xcite , kresch @xcite , and behrend @xcite , based on suggestions of li - tian @xcite .    in symplectic geometry several approaches to solving these transversality issues have been proposed .",

    "see also pardon @xcite for an algebraic approach to constructing virtual fundamental chains .",
    "these approaches have in common that the desired perturbed moduli space should exist _ for abstract reasons_.    on the other hand , it is very useful to have perturbations _ with geometric meaning _ whenever possible .",
    "for example , in the case of toric varieties , fukaya et al @xcite have pointed out that the _ general structure _ of the invariants is not enough to see that the floer cohomology of lagrangian torus orbits is well - defined , and one has to choose a perturbation system adapted to the geometric situation @xcite .",
    "an approach to perturbing moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves based on _ domain - dependent almost complex structures _ was introduced by cieliebak - mohnke @xcite for symplectic manifolds with rational symplectic classes and further developed in ionel - parker @xcite and gerstenberger @xcite .",
    "it was extended by wendl @xcite in genus zero to allow insertions of deligne - mumford classes .",
    "domain - dependent almost complex structures can be made suitably generic only if one does not require invariance under automorphisms of the domain .",
    "thus in order to obtain a perturbed moduli space , one must kill the automorphisms .",
    "this can be accomplished by choosing a _ stabilizing divisor _ : a codimension two almost complex submanifold meeting any pseudoholomorphic curve in a sufficient number of points .",
    "_ approximately _ almost complex submanifolds of codimension two exist by a result of donaldson @xcite ; the original almost complex structure can be perturbed so that the donaldson submanifolds are _ exactly _ almost complex @xcite .",
    "if the symplectic manifold admits a compatible complex structure which makes it a smooth projective variety , then donaldson s results are not necessary since the existence of suitable divisors follows from results of bertini and clemens @xcite .",
    "we treat hamiltonian floer cohomology as a special case of lagrangian floer cohomology . for a pair of lagrangians , results of borthwick - paul - uribe ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.12 ) in the khler case , and auroux - gayet - mohsen @xcite more generally , imply the existence of stabilizing divisors in the complement of each lagrangian such that each holomorphic disk meets the divisor at least once . we show that by gluing together moduli spaces of floer trajectories ( pearled in the sense of biran - cornea @xcite ) , one obtains a moduli space of floer trajectories with the expected boundary .",
    "the moduli space of perturbed trajectories has the structure of a _ cell complex_. in the case of certain lagrangians fixed by an anti - symplectic involution ( in particular , hamiltonian perturbations of the diagonal ) this leads to a well - defined notion of floer cohomology over the rationals .",
    "the main result is the following .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact connected symplectic manifold with symplectic form @xmath1 with @xmath2 \\in h^2(x,{\\mathbb{q}})$ ] rational .",

    "[ introthm ] for a comeager subset of a set of domain - dependent almost complex structures , the moduli spaces of perturbed floer trajectories of index one and two have the structure of cell complexes with the expected boundaries .",
    "the floer coboundary operator @xmath6 is well - defined and satisfies @xmath7 .",
    "we do not prove here any results about independence of floer cohomology from the choice of almost complex structures and hamiltonian perturbations or its relation with singular cohomology .",
    "we sketch the idea in the proof that the floer operator has vanishing square .",
    "the standard idea of proof rests on the idea that _ broken _ floer trajectories are the ends of a compact one - dimensional manifold with boundary .",
    "one takes a broken floer trajectory and using the gluing construction constructs a one - dimensional family of floer trajectories .",
    "moving away from the original broken trajectory one expects , by compactness , to reach an end of the moduli space corresponding to another broken trajectory . in our setting , there are additional boundary components coming from the bubbling of disks with boundary in the lagrangians . using a symmetry argument using anti - symplectic involutions , one shows that the total contribution from these configurations is zero .",
    "we thank mohammed abouzaid , eleny ionel , tom parker , nick sheridan , sushmita venugopalan , and chris wendl for helpful discussions .",
    "in order to see that the floer coboundary operator is well - defined and has the expected properties , one constructs a compactification of the moduli space of stable trajectories which allows the formation of _ bubbles_. the domains of these maps are nodal curves of genus zero ( in the sense of complex geometry ) equipped with strip - like coordinates on a subset of the components . there are morphisms between moduli spaces of these curves of different combinatorial type , first studied by knudsen @xcite and behrend - manin @xcite , which will play a key role in the construction of the perturbations .",
