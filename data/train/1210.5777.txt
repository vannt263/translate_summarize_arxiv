    "let @xmath8 denote this collection of canonical paths ( also known as a routing ) and define    @xmath9 note that in the definition of @xmath10 , the _ bottleneck number _ of @xmath11 , the maximum is taken over directed edges and so is to be distinguished from the related concept of the _ edge - forwarding index _ of @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we distinguish directed and undirected edges by adorning the former with an arrow , and if @xmath12 is an undirected edge connecting vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we write @xmath13 . throughout this paper",
    ", the term _ path _ refers to a sequence of vertices where successive terms are connected by an edge .",
    "repeated vertices are allowed , but no edge may appear more than once .",

    "a simple random walk on @xmath18 begins at some vertex @xmath19 and then proceeds by moving to a neighboring vertex chosen uniformly at random .",
    "this defines a markov process @xmath20 with state space @xmath2 , transition probabilities @xmath21 and stationary distribution @xmath22 this markov chain is irreducible and reversible , thus the operator @xmath23 defined by @xmath24(x)=\\sum_{y\\in x}k(x , y)\\phi(y)\\ ] ] is a self - adjoint contraction on @xmath25 with real eigenvalues @xmath26    whose corresponding eigenfunctions are orthogonal with respect to the inner product @xmath27    it is of interest to estimate @xmath28 as this quantity can be used to bound the _",
    "r_-step distance to stationarity .",
    "for example , when @xmath23 is reversible with respect to @xmath29 , letting @xmath30 denote the distribution of @xmath31 given that @xmath32 , we have the classical bound on the total variation distance to stationarity @xcite @xmath33 more generally , consideration of the jordan normal form of the transition matrix shows that the exponential rate of convergence of any ergodic markov chain is governed by the second largest eigenvalue ( in magnitude ) . because one can often ensure that @xmath34 - by adding holding probabilities , for example - much of the research has focused on bounding @xmath35 .    in the above setting , diaconis and stroock @xcite",
    "give the poincar inequality @xmath36 and the cheeger inequality @xmath37 these inequalities are corollaries of results that hold for all irreducible , reversible markov chains and are based on geometric techniques ( derived by their namesakes ) for bounding the spectral gap of the laplacian on a riemannian manifold .",
    "both ultimately rely on the variational characterization of the eigenvalues of the discrete laplacian @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the dirichlet form @xmath41^{2}\\pi(x)k(x , y)\\ ] ] and @xmath42,\\phi - e_{\\pi}[\\phi]\\right\\rangle _ { \\pi}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{x , y\\in x}[\\phi(x)-\\phi(y)]^{2}\\pi(x)\\pi(y)\\ ] ] is the variance of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath29 , @xmath44=\\left\\langle \\phi,1\\right\\rangle _ { \\pi}$ ] being the corresponding expectation .",
    "this characterization follows easily from the courant - fischer theorem @xcite and the properties of @xmath23 .",
    "the use of canonical paths in this framework originated in the work of jerrum and sinclair on approximating the permanent of a @xmath45-@xmath46 matrix @xcite . for the purposes of this exposition",
    ", we will only be considering the aforementioned inequalities for random walks on graphs , but it should be noted that they are both overestimates of the more general poincar and cheeger bounds . also , observe that the variational characterization immediately gives lower bounds on @xmath35 by evaluating the rayleigh quotient at any nonconstant @xmath43 .",
    "the interested reader is encouraged to consult @xcite for the general bounds , their proofs , and the derivation of these particular cases for random walk on a graph .    though both inequalities are valid for any choice of @xmath8 , their utility hinges upon a clever selection of canonical paths .",
    "in particular , one seeks to minimize @xmath47 for poincar and @xmath10 for cheeger .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that the poincar bound is often superior , regardless of the choice of @xmath8 , but it was left as an open question whether this is always the case .",
    "a little algebra shows that this is equivalent to asking whether @xmath48 for all choices of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to better understanding eigenvalue estimates for simple random walk on connected graphs , knowledge of the conditions under which the preceding inequality holds is of interest in its own right .",
    "for example , bounds relating standard graph theoretic quantities with measures of bottlenecking may be useful in applications involving network management or optimal distribution .",
    "jason fulman and elizabeth wilmer @xcite have shown that poincar beats cheeger for simple random walk on trees , for which there is only one choice of canonical paths .",
    "they also show that for any vertex transitive graph , such as the cayley graph of a group with a symmetric generating set , and any collection of paths @xmath49 one has the inequality @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "thus poincar beats cheeger for random walk on vertex transitive graphs whenever @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , this implies that the poincar bound is superior in these graphs when the paths are taken to be geodesics .    for more background and examples ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other useful references include @xcite . by way of a counterexample",
    ", we answer the question posed by diaconis and stroock in the negative . moreover , we extend the work of fulman and wilmer by providing more general criteria for the poincar bound to prevail .",
    "consider the case when @xmath18 is a complete graph on @xmath53 vertices . then @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "now let @xmath17 be a hamiltonian path with initial vertex @xmath19 and terminal vertex @xmath56 , and define a routing @xmath8 by letting @xmath5 be the unique ( length 1 ) oriented geodesic from @xmath6 to @xmath7 for each @xmath57 and letting @xmath58",
    ". then @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the conjectured inequality is thus @xmath61 because this fails when @xmath62 , there are infinitely many graphs where cheeger beats poincar for some choice of canonical paths , hence the poincar bound is not uniformly superior to the cheeger bound .",
    "observe that since the left hand side is @xmath63 and the right hand side is @xmath64 , the inequality can not be salvaged by adjusting constants .",
    "also , this particular choice of paths is kind of an overkill in that the argument actually shows that if one path in @xmath8 has length greater than @xmath65 and the rest are geodesics , then we still get a counterexample . at the other extreme ,",
    "observe that when @xmath53 is odd , we can take the long path , @xmath17 , to be an eulerian cycle with an edge deleted , and when @xmath53 is even , we can take @xmath17 to be an eulerian cycle on a subgraph on @xmath66 vertices with an edge deleted .",
    "these constructions show that counterexamples appear in all complete graphs on @xmath67 vertices .",
    "let us now examine the case of a complete graph on @xmath68 vertices a little closer .",
    "the transition probabilities are given by @xmath69 so it is easy to see that @xmath18 has @xmath46 as a simple eigenvalue and its only other eigenvalue is @xmath70 with multiplicity @xmath66 .",
    "the preceding analysis shows that if we take @xmath8 as above , then the poincar bound is @xmath71 and the cheeger bound is @xmath72 neither bound is remotely sharp , but cheeger certainly comes out on top for @xmath53 sufficiently large .",
    "if we take @xmath8 to be the unique set of geodesics , in which case @xmath73 , then we obtain a poincar bound of @xmath74 the corresponding cheeger bound is @xmath75 because @xmath76 and @xmath10 are small as they can be in this case , these are the best possible bounds .",
    "thus even though we have an example where cheeger beats poincar ( on a vertex transitive graph ) , it involves a choice of paths that yields terrible bounds while the best possible choice of paths gives an ideal poincar bound that is much better than the optimal cheeger bound .",
    "perhaps then the relevant question is whether the best possible poincar bound is always better than the best possible cheeger bound . if the poincar v. cheeger conjecture is stated in terms of optimal bounds , then one can stipulate that the paths do not have repeated vertices as allowing them to contain cycles can only increase the bottleneck number and the longest path length .",
    "however , the counterexample shows that this restriction alone does not guarantee that the poincar bound is uniformly better than the cheeger bound .",
    "moreover , for an arbitrary graph , there is no reason to suspect that the optimal poincar bound is realized by a choice of paths which gives the optimal cheeger bound since a choice of paths which minimizes @xmath47 need not minimize @xmath10 ( and vice versa ) , so this question is more involved than asking when @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , it seems that a resolution of this issue would require some characterization of the collections of canonical paths that yield the best bounds , which is probably both the most important and the most difficult problem associated with these path - based eigenvalue inequalities .",
    "for example , if @xmath77 denotes the edge - forwarding index of @xmath11 , which is defined just like the bottleneck number but in terms of undirected edges , then it is known @xcite that the problem of determining whether a given integer upper - bounds the minimum of @xmath77 over all minimal , symmetric , and consistent routings @xmath8 is np - complete when @xmath78 .    at this point",
    ", we observe that the construction of the counterexample involved a choice of canonical paths with one exceptionally long path and many shorter paths .",
    "this is no coincidence . for any choice of paths , @xmath8",
    ", there are @xmath79 oriented edges counting multiplicity .",
    "since there are a total of @xmath80 oriented edges in the graph , the pigeonhole principle implies @xmath81 . in terms of the average path length , @xmath82",
    ", we get the inequality @xmath83 .",
    "( note that we are including the @xmath53 empty paths in this average . )",
    "this shows that a sufficient condition for poincar to beat cheeger is that @xmath84 . because @xmath85 , it follows that poincar beats cheeger whenever @xmath86",
    "this idea was used implicitly in @xcite , but the author feels that it is significant enough to be stated directly as    for any simple connected graph @xmath18 , if @xmath8 is a set of canonical paths that satisfies @xmath86 , then hence the poincar bound is superior to the cheeger bound for this choice of paths .",
    "thus in order for the cheeger inequality to prevail , the longest path length must exceed the average path length considerably . when attention is restricted to geodesic paths",
    ", this shows that poincar beats cheeger whenever the mean distance is at least one eighth of the diameter .",
    "in addition to providing a nice general criterion , this observation shows that poincar beats cheeger along geodesics for a larger class of graphs than just those which are vertex transitive .",
    "recalling the inequality @xmath81 where @xmath79 , one sees that @xmath87 is minimized when @xmath8 is taken to be a collection of geodesics .",
    "this choice also minimizes @xmath76 , though there could be other choices of canonical paths not consisting entirely of geodesics for which @xmath88 .",
    "this suggests that geodesic paths are often a good starting point for finding optimal bounds .",
    "of course @xmath89 is only a lower bound for @xmath10 and there are often many choices for @xmath8 such that all paths are geodesics , so this is in no way a sufficient criterion for optimization .",
    "indeed , one can sometimes reduce @xmath10 without increasing @xmath76 by taking a slight detour in traveling between certain vertices .",
    "a little thought will show that this is the case in the following graph .",
    "still , for the reasons indicated above and the fact that geodesics are often among the more obvious choices for canonical paths , it would be interesting to know more about when poincar beats cheeger along geodesics and when geodesic routings yield optimal bounds ( as in the case of complete graphs ) .",
    "all of the examples in @xcite and @xcite used geodesic paths , but the above graph shows that this is not always the best choice .",
    "in this section , we show that if @xmath8 is taken to be the set of canonical paths along any spanning tree of any simple connected graph , then the poincar bound is strictly better than the cheeger bound .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath90 for such @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the inequality is strict whenever the graph has more than two vertices , or equivalently , when @xmath91 .",
    "since every connected graph has at least one spanning tree , this will show that there is always a choice of paths for which poincar beats cheeger .",
    "to begin , let @xmath0 be a simple connected graph on @xmath92 vertices and let @xmath93 be any spanning tree for @xmath18 .",
    "then we can define @xmath94 to be the ( unique ) set of paths along @xmath93 .",
    "we will show that poincar beats cheeger for such routings by first dealing with the case where @xmath76 is large and then using the results of @xcite to handle the remaining case .",
    "we note at the outset that as there is only one connected graph with @xmath95 and it is easily verified that @xmath96 in this case , we can assume throughout that @xmath91 .",
    "now let us say that that a routing is subordinate with respect to a path @xmath97 if for all @xmath98 with @xmath99 , @xmath100 . with this terminology",
    ", we can dispense with the large @xmath76 case using the following lemma .    if @xmath8 is subordinate with respect to a longest path @xmath17 and @xmath101 , then @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 because if @xmath104 , then for all @xmath105 @xmath100 , so there are @xmath106 initial vertices and @xmath107 terminal vertices of paths through a central edge of @xmath17 . consequently ,",
    "if @xmath108 ( thus @xmath109 ) , then @xmath110    since a spanning tree routing is subordinate with respect to each of its paths , lemma 1 shows that if @xmath94 is the set of canonical paths along a spanning tree @xmath93 of @xmath111 then the poincar bound is strictly better than the cheeger bound whenever @xmath108 .",
    "we now note that for any connected graph @xmath18 on @xmath53 vertices , we must have @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath113 , @xmath18 is a tree and there is only one choice of canonical paths . in this case , every path is subordinate with respect to the longest path , which has length @xmath114 , so the first line in the proof of lemma 1 shows that @xmath115 since @xmath91 whenever @xmath116 , we see that if @xmath18 is a graph on @xmath116 vertices with @xmath113 , then @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , we can assume henceforth that @xmath117 .",
    "for the remaining case , we appeal to theorem 4 in @xcite , the proof of which is included for completeness .",
    "let @xmath93 be a tree with @xmath53 vertices having maximal degree @xmath118 and bottleneck number @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath120    since @xmath93 is a tree with @xmath53 vertices , @xmath93 has @xmath66 edges , and for any oriented edge @xmath12 , the number of pairs of vertices @xmath121 with @xmath122 is of the form @xmath123 , @xmath124 where deletion of edge @xmath12 cuts @xmath93 into two components of size @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "because @xmath123 is increasing in @xmath125 for @xmath124 , it is enough to show there exists an edge @xmath127 whose removal divides @xmath93 into two components , the smaller of which has size at least @xmath128 .",
    "given such an edge , we have @xmath129    thus we need only to demonstrate the existence of @xmath127 .",
    "to this end , note that if there is an edge which cuts @xmath93 into two pieces of equal size , then we may take this edge to be @xmath127 .",
    "otherwise , the deletion of any edge divides @xmath93 into two pieces of size @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively , where @xmath130 . in this case",
    ", we can orient the edges by directing each edge from its endpoint in the component of size @xmath125 to its endpoint in the component of size @xmath126 . because there are @xmath53 vertices and @xmath66 edges , there must exist a vertex @xmath131 with indegree @xmath45 . since @xmath132 , there must be some edge leaving @xmath131 whose deletion cuts @xmath93 into two components , the smaller of which has size at least @xmath128 . calling this edge @xmath127",
    "establishes the result .",
    "now by lemma 1 , we can assume that @xmath133 . also , since @xmath91 implies there are at least 3 vertices in @xmath18 ( and thus in @xmath93 ) , the maximal degree of the vertices in @xmath93 is @xmath118 . because @xmath134 , lemma 2 shows that @xmath135 therefore , since @xmath136 , thus @xmath137 , and we may assume also that @xmath117 , we have @xmath138    we record the above result as    for any simple connected graph @xmath18 , if @xmath8 is taken to be the set of paths along any spanning tree of @xmath18 , then @xmath90 for this choice of @xmath8 . if @xmath18 has at least 3 vertices , then the inequality is strict .",
    "since every connected graph has at least one spanning tree , we have the immediate corollary    for every simple connected graph , there is a choice of canonical paths such that the poincar bound is strictly better than the cheeger bound .",
    "it is worth pointing out that since trees are acyclic , these results also do not depend on whether repeated vertices are allowed . of course , the above construction of @xmath8 is certainly not optimal as it inflates both the bottleneck number and the longest path length by precluding certain combinations of paths .",
    "moreover , different choices of spanning trees can yield different bounds .",
    "for instance , in the complete graph on @xmath139 vertices , two possible choices for @xmath93 are a hamiltonian path or the geodesics emanating from some vertex @xmath19 . in the first case",
    ", we get the poincar bound @xmath140 and the cheeger bound @xmath141    while in the second case , the poincar bound is @xmath71 and the cheeger bound is @xmath142",
    "we have established that poincar is not uniformly superior to cheeger for all simple connected graphs and cheeger is not uniformly superior to poincar for any simple connected graph . strictly speaking ,",
    "this resolves the question put forth by diaconis and stroock , but it would be nice to know whether the best possible poincar bounds are always better than the best possible cheeger bounds . a more complete characterization of the choice of canonical paths for which poincar beats cheeger would likely prove helpful in settling this question .",
    "lemma 1 and theorems 1 and 2 offer partial results in this direction and subsume all previous findings , but the matter is still far from being resolved . perhaps examining the case of geodesic routings more closely would shed some light on these issues .",
    "also , since every connected graph can be obtained by adding edges to a spanning tree or deleting edges from a complete graph , it may be possible to obtain related results using surgery methods in conjunction with the above analyses of these extreme cases .",
    "lastly , and probably of greatest practical importance , one would like to know more about how to find routings which yield the best bounds .",
