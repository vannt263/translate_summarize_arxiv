    "fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , denoted @xmath0 with @xmath1 , is a stochastic process characterized by the following three properties :    gaussianity ;    self - similarity with parameter @xmath2 ;    stationarity of the increments .",
    "by self - similarity , it is meant that the law of @xmath3 scales as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes equality of finite - dimensional distributions . by stationarity of the increments , it is meant that the process @xmath6 has the same distribution for any time - shift @xmath7 .",
    "it may be shown that these three properties actually characterize fbm in the sense that it is the _ unique _ ( up to a constant ) such process for a given @xmath1 .",
    "fbm plays an important role in both theory and applications , especially in connection with long - range dependence @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in the multivariate counterparts of fbm , called operator fractional brownian motions ( ofbms ) . in the multivariate context ,",
    "an ofbm @xmath8 is a collection of random vectors , where the symbol @xmath9 denotes transposition .",
    "it is also gaussian and has stationary increments .",
    "moreover , as is standard for the multivariate context , in this paper , we assume that ofbms are _ proper _ , that is , for each @xmath10 , the distribution of @xmath11 is not contained in a proper subspace of @xmath12 .",
    "however , self - similarity is now replaced by    ( ii@xmath13 ) operator self - similarity .    a proper multivariate process @xmath3 is called ( strictly ) operator self - similar ( o.s.s . ) if it is continuous in law for all @xmath10 and the expression ( [ e : s.s . ] ) holds for some matrix @xmath2 . here , the expression @xmath14 is defined by means of the convergent series @xmath15 operator self - similarity extends the usual notion of self - similarity and was first studied thoroughly in @xcite ; see also section 11 in @xcite and chapter 9 in @xcite .",
    "the theory of operator self - similarity runs somewhat parallel to that of operator stable measures ( see @xcite ) and is also related to that of operator scaling random fields ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ofbms are of interest in several areas and for reasons similar to those in the univariate case . for example , ofbms arise and are used in the context of multivariate time series and long - range dependence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another context is that of queueing systems , where reflected ofbms model the size of multiple queues in particular classes of queueing models and are studied in problems related to , for example , large deviations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "partly motivated by this interest in ofbms , several authors consider constructions and properties of ofbms .",
    "maejima and mason @xcite , in particular , construct examples of ofbms through time domain integral representations . mason and xiao @xcite study sample path properties of ofbms .",
    "bahadoran , benassi and dbicki @xcite provide wavelet decompositions of ofbms , study their sample path properties and consider questions of identification .",
    "becker - kern and pap @xcite consider estimation of the real spectrum of the self - similarity exponent .",
    "a number of other works on operator self - similarity are naturally related to ofbms ; see , for example , @xcite , section 11 , and references therein .    to the reader less familiar with ofbms",
    ", we should note that the multivariate case is quite different from the univariate case .",
    "for example , consider an ofbm @xmath3 whose exponent @xmath2 has characteristic roots @xmath16 with positive real parts . by using operator self - similarity and stationarity of increments ,",
    "one can argue , as in the univariate case , that @xmath17 and the symbol @xmath18 denotes the adjoint operator .",
    "however , in contrast with the univariate case , it is _ not _ generally true that @xmath19 and hence the ofbm is not characterized by @xmath2 and a matrix @xmath20 .",
    "another important difference is that the self - similarity exponent of an operator self - similar process is generally not unique .",
    "the latter fact has been well known since the fundamental work of hudson and mason @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall it , together with some related results , in section [ ss : o.s.s._processes ] .    in this work ,",
    "we address several new and , in our view , important questions about ofbms . in view of ( [ e : ofbm - cov ] ) and ( [ e : ebh(t)bh(s)*_neq_ebh(s)bh(t ) * ] ) , since the covariance structure of an ofbm can not be determined in general , we pursue the characterization of ofbms in terms of their integral representations ( section [ s : integral_repres_ofbm ] ) . in the spectral domain , under the mild and natural assumption that the characteristic roots of @xmath2 satisfy @xmath21",
    "we show that an ofbm admits the integral representation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a matrix with complex - valued entries , @xmath24 denotes its complex conjugate , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a suitable multivariate complex - valued gaussian measure . in the time domain and",
    "when , in addition to ( [ e:0<re(hk)<1_intro ] ) , we have @xmath28 the ofbm admits the integral representation @xmath29 where @xmath30 are matrices with real - valued entries and @xmath31 is a suitable multivariate real - valued gaussian measure . the representation ( [ e : ofbm - repres - time ] ) is obtained from ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) by taking the fourier transform of the deterministic kernel in ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) .",
    "we shall provide rigorous arguments for this step by using primary matrix functions .",
    "( even in the univariate case , very often this step is unjustifiably taken as more or less evident . ) on a related note , but from a different angle , the representations  ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) and ( [ e : ofbm - repres - time ] ) always define gaussian processes with stationary increments that satisfy ( [ e : s.s .",
    "] ) for a matrix @xmath2 .",
    "we shall provide sufficient condition for these processes to be proper ( see section  [ s : properness ] ) and , hence , to be ofbms .",
    "subclasses of the representations ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) and ( [ e : ofbm - repres - time ] ) were considered in the works referenced above .",
    "maejima and mason @xcite consider ofbms given by the representation ( [ e : ofbm - repres - time ] ) with @xmath32 . mason and xiao @xcite take ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) with @xmath33 .",
    "bahadoran _ _ et al.__@xcite consider ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) with @xmath23 having full rank and real - valued entries .",
    "( such ofbms , for example , are necessarily time - reversible ; see theorem [ t : time - revers_ofbm ] and also remark [ r : example_proper_with_deficient_rank_a ] . )",
    "we would again like to emphasize that , in contrast with these works , the representations ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) and ( [ e : ofbm - repres - time ] ) characterize _ all _ ofbms ( under the mild and natural conditions ( [ e:0<re(hk)<1_intro ] ) and ( [ e : re(hk)_neq_1/2_intro ] ) ) .    in particular , the representations ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) and",
    "( [ e : ofbm - repres - time ] ) provide a natural framework for the study of many properties of ofbms . in this paper",
    ", we provide conditions in terms of @xmath23 in ( [ e : ofbm - repres - sp ] ) ( or @xmath30 in ( [ e : ofbm - repres - time ] ) ) for ofbms to be time - reversible ( see section [ s : time_reversibility ] ) .",
    "time - reversibility is shown to be equivalent to the condition ( [ e : ebh(t)bh(s)*_neq_ebh(s)bh(t ) * ] ) and hence , in view of ( [ e : ofbm - cov ] ) , corresponds to the situation where the covariance structure of the ofbm is given by @xmath34 ) , and will be largely absent from this paper .",
    "furthermore , in this paper , we also discuss some additional properties of ofbms which are of independent interest .",
    "first , we prove that ofbms have a rigid dependence structure among components , which we call the _ dichotomy principle _",
    "( section [ s : dicho ] ) .",
    "more precisely , under long - range dependence ( in the sense considered in section [ s : dicho ] ) , we show that the components of the increments of an ofbm are either independent or long - range dependent , that is , they can not be short - range dependent in a non - trivial way .",
    "since , in the univariate case , the increments of fbm are often considered representative of all long - range dependent series , this result raises the question of whether ofbms are flexible enough to capture multivariate long - range dependence structures .",
    "second , we also discuss the notion of operator brownian motions ( obms ) and related questions ( section [ s : obm ] ) .",
    "obms are defined as having independent increments and are known to admit @xmath35 as an exponent .",
    "we also show , in particular , that an ofbm with @xmath35 does not necessarily have independent increments and hence is not necessarily an obm .",
    "( in contrast , in the univariate case , @xmath36 necessarily implies brownian motion . )    in summary , the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ s : preliminaries ] , we provide the necessary background for the paper and some definitions . in section [",
    "s : integral_repres_ofbm ] , we construct integral representations for ofbms in the spectral and time domains .",
    "section [ s : properness ] furnishes sufficient conditions for properness .",
    "section [ s : time_reversibility ] is dedicated to time - reversibility .",
    "the dichotomy principle is established in section [ s : dicho ] and the properties of obms are studied in section [ s : obm ] .",
    "appendices [ ss : ft][a : jordan_form ] contain several important technical results used throughout the paper , as well as some proofs .",
    "we begin by introducing some notation and considering some preliminaries on the exponential map and operator self - similarity that are used throughout the paper .      in this paper , the notation and terminology for finite - dimensional operator theory will be preferred over their matrix analogs . however , whenever convenient , the latter will be used .",

    "it is enough to `` guess '' the form of the spectral representation and to verify that it gives self - similarity and stationarity of the increments ( and hence , immediately , fbm ) . in the multivariate case",
