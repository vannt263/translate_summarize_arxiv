    "stern s diatomic sequence @xmath0 is a particularly well studied sequence ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein , as well as @xcite ) .",
    "the first section is devoted to showing that this sequence is _",
    "interesting_. in particular , we shall look at the following properties .",
    "* @xmath1 is a bijection between the positive natural numbers and the positive rational numbers , * @xmath2 extends to a continuous strictly increasing function on @xmath3 $ ] known as `` conway s box function '' ( it s inverse is @xmath4 , minkowski s question - mark function ) , * it shares a number of similarities to the fibonacci sequence ; in particular , it has a binet type formula .",
    ".1 in the remaining three sections are devoted to three analogues of stern s sequence :    * we replace addition by another binary operation ; in particular , we define @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "this sequence is related to stern s sequence and arises from certain sphere packings .",
    "it has apparently not appeared before in the literature .",
    "* we replace the complementary indexing sequences @xmath7 and @xmath8 by another pair of complementary sequences ; in particular , let @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 form a specific pair of complementary beatty sequences .",
    "this sequence has been extensively studied as @xmath12 is the number of ways @xmath13 can be represented as a sum of distinct fibonacci numbers . * the known binet type formula for stern s sequence @xcite is written in terms of the sequence @xmath14 ( : = the number of terms in the binary expansion of @xmath13 ) .",
    "we replace @xmath14by @xmath15(:= the number of terms in the zeckendorf representation of @xmath13 ) . this new sequence ,",
    "apparently not studied before , is an integer sequence with several interesting ( and several conjectural ) properties .",
    "consider the following  diatomic array \" @xcite formed as a variant of pascal s triangle ; each entry is either the value directly above or else the sum of the two above it . @xmath16",
    "the word  diatomic \" is used here since every entry of the diatomic array gets its value from either one or two entries above and gives that value to three entries below , hence has  valence \" 4 or 5 ( hence the diatomic array models a kind of crystalline alloy of two elements ) .",
    "ignoring the right most column and reading the numbers as in a book , we get stern s diatomic sequence : @xmath17 the sequence is thus defined by the recurrence @xmath18 we define @xmath19 to be 0 ( the value consistent with @xmath20 ) .",
    "perhaps the most celebrated property of this sequence is that every positive rational number is represented exactly once as @xmath21 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we rephrase this fact as a theorem .",
    "every ordered pair of relatively prime positive integers appears exactly once in the sequence @xmath22 .    for an ordered pair ,",
    "consider the process of subtracting the smallest from largest ( stop if equal ) .",
    "for example , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . by the definition of stern s sequence ,",
    "@xmath25 every relatively prime pair appears ( if not , then there is an ordered pair not on the list with lowest sum .",
    "apply the process ; the result has lower sum and so is @xmath26 for some @xmath13 and so the original pair is either @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) .",
    "every relatively prime pair appears _ exactly _ once since , if not , then there exist @xmath29 with @xmath30 and such that @xmath31 is as small as possible . applying",
    "the process to both implies @xmath32 and thus @xmath33 which is impossible",
    ".    one can then rewrite any sum over relatively prime pairs in terms of stern s sequence . as an example",
    ", we rephrase the riemann hypothesis .",
    "first note that @xmath34 is an explicit bijection from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "then the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to @xmath37 briefly why this is so : the mbius function can be written as @xmath38 and so the left hand side is really just merten s function @xmath39 .",
    "the connection between merten s function and the riemann hypothesis is well - known ; see for example @xcite .",
    "minkowski s question mark function was introduced in 1904 as an example of a  singular function \" ( it is strictly increasing yet its derivative exists and equals 0 almost everywhere ) .",
