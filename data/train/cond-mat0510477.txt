    "first - principles studies illustrating the effect of technologically relevant semiconductor surfaces such as inas,@xcite gaas@xcite and si(100 ) on the electronic properties of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) have been published recently . in the case of si(100 ) , the study was focused on determining the lowest - energy structural configuration and modifications to the electronic structure of a metallic ( 6,6 ) swnt as a result of its interaction with this surface .",
    "this calculation was performed for a nanotube in the proximity to an either clean@xcite or selectively hydrogen - passivated@xcite si(100 ) surface where the nanotube axis was parallel to the trench between adjacent si dimer rows .",
    "remarkably , there have been no studies of this system for _ semiconducting _ tubes , in different geometrical configurations , nor on the dependence of the properties of the hybrid system against nanotube diameter .",
    "these are relevant issues to be addressed , as experimental techniques permitting the ultra - clean deposition of swnts onto doped si(100 ) and other semiconductor surfaces in ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) at room temperature have been reported.@xcite as contaminant - free atomistic manipulation becomes more feasible , the promise of molecular systems with tunable electronic and mechanical properties becomes a reality .",
    "it is clear that near - term applications for carbon nanotubes in electronic and opto - electronic devices would benefit from their integration with conventional semiconductor platforms such as si or gaas . in this direction , rectifying carbon nanotube - silicon heterojunction arrays have been demonstrated,@xcite and semiconductor heterostructures of gaas / alas and gaas / mnas have been used as electrical contacts to individual swnts.@xcite recent experiments@xcite showing the existence of two preferential directions for the growth of swnts on silicon surfaces indicate that there is a non - negligible interaction between the swnt and its substrate .",
    "one relevant issue which remains to be addressed is the nature of the mechanical and electronic properties of the semiconductor - nanotube interfaces .",
    "the subject of this work is the interaction between the unpassivated si(100 ) surface and semiconducting carbon nanotubes using density functional theory ( dft).@xcite those studies are complemented with additional calculations on metallic nanotubes of comparable diameter .",
    "we study nanotubes that are in parallel or perpendicular orientations relative to the si dimer row direction . we have found a striking and somewhat counter - intuitive reduction of the semiconducting gaps for these hybrid systems which are composed of two semiconductors .",
    "the nanotubes presented in this study have diameters between 5 and 12  .",
    "this work was comprehensive in order to find robust properties on these hybrid systems ; in particular those independent of diameter and chirality as experiments do not have fine control of these variables yet .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] discusses the theoretical approximations employed and the structural configurations considered in this study . in section [ sec : results ] we show the resulting atomic configurations of the combined si(100)-swnt system , which have marked trends depending on the original electronic character of the swnts involved ( metallic or semiconducting ) .",
    "results from voronoi and hirshfield population analysis@xcite are also provided and show electronic charge being transferred from the nanotubes to the silicon slab .",
    "the resulting band structures at equilibrium , as well as the projected density of states ( pdos ) over the atomic species involved are reported also .",
    "the pdos indicates a clear hybridization of the bands between surface and nanotube states .",
    "this hybridization is further confirmed by depicting wavefunctions near the electronic gaps .",
    "finally , we present the change in energy prior to the force minimization procedure , as the nanotubes are rotated about their axes in close proximity to the si(100 ) surface .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our calculations in the local density approximation@xcite ( lda ) were performed with the siesta code.@xcite the exchange - correlation potential employed is the one parameterized by perdew - zunger,@xcite based on the ceperley - alder data.@xcite core electrons are replaced by norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials.@xcite for greater variational freedom , a double-@xmath0 basis set for @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals , and a single-@xmath0 basis set for @xmath3 orbitals was constructed using the prescription of junquera _ _ et al.__@xcite to ensure the flexibility in our basis sets , their parameters were optimized by means of the simplex algorithm @xcite on graphite and diamond for the carbon basis , while the silicon basis was optimized only in the diamond structure .",
    "as the hydrogen atoms only served to passivate dangling bonds , the hydrogen basis was not optimized .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : table1 ] , the lattice constants obtained from the optimized bases compare well with previous theoretical estimates .",
    ".[tab : table1]lattice constants obtained with our bases , to exemplify the flexibility of our basis set . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to determine the best angular ` starting ' structure a chiral nanotube has to be rotated about its axis .",
    "chirality precludes a highly symmetric configuration , potentially with the lowest energy , from being easily visualized .",
    "the energies as a function of @xmath4 with no atomic relaxation were obtained , and the difference of those energies with respect to the energy of a system where the tubes and surface are 10  apart are reported ( this is called the energy gain and it is not an adsorption energy as the structures are not fully relaxed ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , where the lower curves ( red squares ) refer to swnts in the perpendicular configuration .",
    "the upper curves ( blue triangles ) refer to the swnts in the parallel configuration . for our chiral tubes ,",
    "the range of angles is given by @xmath5 , where gcd@xmath6 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this range gives the maximum angular freedom that the nanotubes will have before the position of their carbon atoms becomes periodic .",
    "notice the almost complete independence on @xmath4 for this energy for all semiconducting tubes , due to their weaker bonding as compared with metallic nanotubes .",
    "the ( 6,2 ) nanotube with the smallest studied diameter shows the most pronounced oscillations .",
    "this is due to its close proximity to the si(100 ) surface that can greatly modify its energy as carbon and silicon atoms are brought closer to each other as a result of the tube s rotation about its own axis .",
    "the distinctive trend for the metallic tube indicates an optimal configuration in which an extra bond ( for a total of eight bonds ) might form when full relaxation is performed .",
    "all the previous results shown in this paper were obtained at @xmath9 . despite the fact that the metallic tube might not be in optimal angular configuration ,",
    "our results are the first to date to show distinctively different trends for semiconducting and metallic nanotubes .",
    "in fact , once the metallic tube is in its optimal configuration , the trends provided here will only be accentuated .    in the previously studied cases ( refs .  ) , the highly symmetric atomic arrangement of the achiral ( 6,6 ) swnt with respect to the underlying surface silicon atoms results in optimal angular configurations in which @xmath10 is a function of @xmath4 .",
    "we consider that in a more general setting , chirality precludes such a highly symmetric configuration from occurring : the relative position of carbon atoms closest to the surface with respect to surface silicon atoms becomes a complicated function of the chiral angle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we observe a small energy dependence per unit length ( of the order of 100 mev /  ) against the tube s angle of rotation @xmath4 .",
    "this justifies the angular sweeping at fixed @xmath10 for our chiral swnts .",
    "it is also apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] that the metallic nanotube displays an energy dependence on the angle of rotation twice as large as the semiconducting swnts .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that metallic tubes stay closer to the surface in comparison to semiconducting nanotubes of the same diameter .",
    "this could also be influenced by the different surface reconstruction we employed .",
    "the prominent difference in the adsorption energies presented in table [ tab : tableae ] suggests a mechanism for the separation between semiconducting and metallic nanotubes in solid phase over this diameter range , provided they are always adsorbed in configurations with the greatest energy gain .",
    "experimental techniques for nanotube separation to date rely on the chemistry and dipole moments of samples _ in solution_.@xcite",
    "we have studied semiconducting swnts adsorbed on the si(100 ) surface .",
    "we used the results from the ( 9,3 ) swnt , which compare well to previous published results for metallic swnts@xcite as a test bed for our choice of exchange - correlation potential and surface reconstruction .",
    "semiconducting swnts of the diameter range studied are placed at an almost constant distance to the surface .",
    "those tubes are 0.5  closer to the surface when they are above and aligned with the trench between adjacent dimer rows , in comparison with any other configuration in which the trench and the tube axis do not align .",
    "we found a weak angular dependence on the adsorption energy of the system , and we believe this dependence will be further lowered as the length of the nanotube s unit cell increases , due to the loss of symmetry in the relative positions of the carbon atoms in the swnt closest to the si(100 ) surface atoms . for the ( 9,3 ) swnt , we found in agreement with refs .   that it remains metallic in either configuration , but the weak angular dependence tells us it will remain at an almost fixed height @xmath10 , independent of its angular orientation .",
    "we also found a smaller adsorption energy for semiconducting swnts in comparison to metallic swnts of similar diameter , consistent with weaker bonding .",
    "the electronic properties of these hybrid systems will vary in a qualitative way according to the relative orientation of the swnt ( parallel , perpendicular ) with respect to the surface , but we find from our calculations that the system composed of semiconducting tubes on the semiconducting si(100 ) surface displays dramatically smaller gaps in comparison with the isolated semiconducting systems that compose it , in both studied configurations .",
    "this reduction of the semiconducting gap can be ascribed to the modification of the band structure due to the surface reconfiguration , electronic charge transfer from the nanotubes and the resulting band hybridization from carbon states at energies where the gap appears for isolated tubes , as the pdos indicates .",
    "the hoes for the hybrid systems can be extended , located predominately over either the silicon slab or the swnt , or be localized at the interface between the swnt and the si(100 ) forming a one - dimensional conduction channel . in contrast , the lues tend to be more localized towards the surface when semiconducting nanotubes are brought into proximity .",
    "currently , experimental results on this system are starting to emerge.@xcite we hope that the results provided in this paper motivate further experimental work in the area , as the properties described in here might be useful for electronic as well as opto - electronic applications .",
    "systematic studies as the one presented here are truly necessary in order to assess robust properties of this hybrid system against properties that might appear for a given choice of chiral angles and geometrical configuration . in our case",
    ", the gap reduction appears for both configurations , and the bonding lengths are found to be consistently larger for semiconducting nanotubes in comparison with metallic ones .",
    "this implies a reduced absorption energy for semiconducting nanotubes on this surface . in turn",
    ", this might serve to mechanically attach metallic nanotubes and release semiconducting ones by suitable heating under dry conditions.@xcite",
