    "the nuclear shell - model , describing a nucleus as a system of nucleons moving in a mean field , describes many basic features of nuclear structure .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known , that the strong components of a realistic model for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction induce correlations into the nuclear wave function , which are beyond this mean field description . in particular",
    "one has to consider the two - nucleon short - range correlations , induced by the repulsive components of the nn interaction , and the tensor correlations which are mainly due to the strong tensor components of the pion exchange contribution to the nn interaction .",
    "a detailed investigation of these correlations should provide insight into the structure of the interaction of two nucleons in a nuclear medium .",
    "therefore it has always been a great challenge of nuclear physics to develop experiments and theoretical models , which explore these correlations .    photoinduced",
    "two - nucleon knockout experiments like ( @xmath3,nn ) or ( e , e@xmath1nn ) reactions seem to be a powerful tool for such investigations since the probability that a real or virtual photon is absorbed by a pair of nucleons should be a direct measure for the correlations between these nucleons .",
    "such triple coincidence experiments have been made possible by the progress in accelerator and detector technology and first measurements of the exclusive @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c reaction have been performed at nikhef in amsterdam  @xcite and mami in mainz  @xcite .",
    "first investigations on these data  @xcite indicate that resolution of discrete final states provides an interesting tool to disentangle and thus separately investigate contributions of one - body currents , due to short - range correlations , and two - body isobar currents .",
    "in particular , clear signatures for short - range correlations have been obtained for the transition to the ground state of @xmath2c .",
    "this result gives rise to the hope that a similar separation between two - body currents and correlations is possible also in the ( e , e@xmath1pn ) reaction .",
    "this would be of particular interest as tensor correlations will predominantly be present in the wave function of a @xmath4 pair .",
    "thus ( e , e@xmath1pn ) experiments would complete the information on nn correlations .",
    "it is obvious that such experiments are more difficult as they require a triple coincidence measurement with a detection of a neutron . a proposal for the experimental study of the exclusive @xmath0o(e",
    ", e@xmath1pn)@xmath2n reaction has been recently approved in mainz  @xcite .",
    "this first experiment will demonstrate the feasibility of triple coincidence experiments including neutrons with high resolution and will serve as exploratory study for the investigations of @xmath5 correlations .",
    "also the theoretical analysis of the @xmath4 data is a bit more involved than the analysis of the @xmath6 data since the contribution of the correlations to the @xmath4 knockout has to compete with a significant contribution from pion exchange currents  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one has to treat the tensor correlations appropriately .",
    "it is the aim of this investigation to employ correlated many - body wave functions , which are derived from a realistic nn interaction , in a calculation of ( e , e@xmath1pn ) cross sections which accounts for the contribution of one- and two - body parts in the nuclear current operator .",
    "the correlated wave functions are determined in the framework of the coupled cluster method , which is also often referred to as the @xmath7 method  @xcite , using the so - called @xmath8 approximation .",
    "this approach is similar to the evaluation of the two - body spectral function in terms of the brueckner @xmath9-matrix as it has been used e.g.  in the analysis of the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pp)@xmath2c reaction  @xcite .",
    "the argonne v14 potential  @xcite has been used for the nn interaction .",
    "after this introduction we will shortly review the coupled cluster method in section 2 and discuss some features of the correlated wave functions derived in this scheme .",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements for the one- and two - body current contributions and the resulting cross sections are described in section 3 .",
    "after the discussion of the numerical results for the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pn)@xmath2n reaction in section 4 , we will summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "the basic features of the coupled cluster method have been described already in the review article by kmmel et al .",
    "more recent developments and applications can be found in  @xcite . here",
    "we will only present some basic equations , which are necessary to describe the approach we have used to determine the correlated nuclear wave functions to be used in the calculation of cross sections for the exclusive @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pn)@xmath2n reaction .",
    "the many - body wave function of the coupled cluster or @xmath7 method can be written @xmath10 the state @xmath11 refers to the uncorrelated model state , which we have chosen to be a slater determinant of harmonic oscillator functions with an oscillator length @xmath12=1.72 fm , which is appropriate for the description of our target nucleus @xmath0o .",
    "this choice leads to small amplitudes for the operator @xmath13 .",
    "the linked @xmath14-particle @xmath14-hole excitation operators can be written @xmath15 here and in the following the sum is restricted to oscillator states @xmath16 which are unoccupied in the model state @xmath11 , while states @xmath17 refer to states which are occupied in @xmath11 . for the application discussed here",
    "we assume the so - called @xmath8 approximation , i.e.  we restrict the correlation operator in ( [ eq : exps ] ) to the terms with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "one may introduce one- and two - body wave functions @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the operator antisymmetrizing the product of one - body wave functions . using these definitions",

    "the cross sections calculated with the one - body and @xmath101 currents are of about the same size , whereas those calculated with seagull and pion - in - flight are much smaller .",
    "the @xmath101-current is therefore important in all the three relative states , in particular at large values of the recoil momentum , while the one - body current gives a more meaningful contribution to @xmath109 and @xmath116 knockout and at low values of @xmath93 .",
    "the cross section has been calculated for the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pn)@xmath2n reaction leading to the ground state and the first excited @xmath117 and @xmath118 states in the residual nucleus @xmath2n .",
    "the calculations account for correlation effects , using correlated wave functions calculated in the framework of the coupled cluster method , mec contributions and the effects of final state interaction of the outgoing nucleons with the residual nucleus . as an example we consider the so - called super - parallel kinematics with a value for the energy ( @xmath119 = 215 mev ) and momentum transfer ( @xmath120 = 316 mev / c ) which is appropriate for experiments to be performed at mami in mainz .",
    "the cross sections for ( e , e@xmath1pn ) are about an order of magnitude larger than corresponding cross sections for ( e , e@xmath1pp ) reactions .",
    "this enhancement is partly due to the importance of mec , the pion seagull contribution in particular , and partly due to the enhanced importance of correlation effects in @xmath4 pairs as compared to @xmath6 pairs .",
    "the relative importance of the mec contribution as compared to the correlation effects depends on the final state of the residual nucleus .",
    "this is similar to the observations made for ( e , e@xmath1pp )  @xcite .",
    "the calculated cross sections are rather sensitive to details of the nuclear correlations considered and in particular to the presence of the tensor component .",
    "in fact , a correlation function without this component gives quite different results for the calculated cross sections .",
    "also the choice of the structure amplitudes is important and produces a sensible effect in the shape and size of the cross sections .",
    "this means that an accurate determination of the spectral density and therefore of the overlap wave functions is required in order to predict in a satisfactory and reliable way the experimental yields .",
    "this will hopefully enable us to disentangle the effects of the mec contributions from those of the nuclear correlations .",
    "these observations support the efforts to complete our knowledge on nuclear correlations obtained from ( e , e@xmath1pp ) reactions by corresponding experiments on ( e , e@xmath1pn ) .",
