    "the whirlpool galaxy , m51 or ngc5194 , is one of the classical grand - design spiral galaxies .",
    "the two spiral arms of m51 can be traced through more than 360  in azimuthal angle in numerous wavebands .",
    "m51 is probably perturbed by a recent encounter with its companion galaxy ngc5195 .",
    "such interactions usually result in enhanced star formation , either localized or global , as tidal forces and density waves compress the interstellar medium . in m51",
    "this may have resulted in two systems of density waves @xcite .",
    "m51 was the first external galaxy where polarized radio emission was detected @xcite and one of the few external galaxies where optical polarization has been studied @xcite . @xcite and @xcite found that the lines of the regular magnetic field in m51 have a spiral shape , but their resolution was too low to determine how well the field is aligned with the optical spiral arms .",
    "@xcite realized that , at wavelengths of @xmath9  cm , only polarized emission from a foreground layer reaches the observer because of faraday depolarization , and the faraday rotation measures obtained at the longer wavelengths are much smaller than those at shorter wavelengths .",
    "@xcite observed a fractional polarization at @xmath10 of around @xmath11 in the optical disc , increasing to @xmath12 at large radii , and faraday rotation measures of a similar magnitude to those found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the global magnetic field of m51 using radio data at four frequencies and found that the average orientation of the fitted magnetic field is similar to the average pitch angle of the optical spiral arms measured by @xcite .",
    "@xcite represented the magnetic field in the disc of m51 as a superposition of periodic azimuthal modes , with about equal contribution from the axisymmetric @xmath13 and the bisymmetric @xmath6 ones .",
    "their fit contains a magnetic field reversal at about 5  kpc radius which extends over a few kpc in azimuth .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found evidence for an axisymmetric magnetic field in the halo of m51 ( visible at @xmath14 and @xmath3 ) with a reversed direction ( inwards ) with respect to the axisymmetric mode of the disc field ( outwards ) .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that the magnetic field of m51 is strong and partly regular , with some interesting properties .",
    "however , some of their results may be affected by the low angular resolution which was limited by the effelsberg single - dish data at @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , no correction for missing large - scale structure could be applied to the vla @xmath4 polarization data because no single - dish map was available at that time .    here",
    "we present a refined analysis based on new data with higher resolution and better sensitivity .",
    "our new surveys of m51 in total and linearly polarized @xmath16 and @xmath4 radio continuum emission combines the resolution of the vla with the sensitivity of the effelsberg single - dish telescope .",
    "the new maps are of comparable resolution to the maps of the co(10 ) emission @xcite and mid - infrared dust emission @xcite and are of unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "the shape of the spiral radio arms and the comparison to the arms seen with different tracers were discussed in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the spiral shocks in m51 are strong and regular @xcite and offer the possibility to compare arm  interarm contrasts of gas and the magnetic field .",
    "we analyse our new data to try to separate the contribution to the observed polarized emission from regular ( or mean ) magnetic fields and anisotropic random magnetic fields produced by compression and/or shear in the spiral arms .",
    "the new high - resolution polarization maps allow us for the first time to investigate in detail the interaction between the magnetic fields and the shock fronts .",
    "results from the barred galaxies ngc  1097 and ngc  1365 showed that the small - scale and the large - scale magnetic field components behave differently , i.e. the small - scale field is compressed significantly in the bar s shock , while the large - scale field is hardly compressed @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted as a strong indication that the large - scale field is coupled to the warm , diffuse gas which is only weakly compressed .",
    "we investigate whether a similar decoupling of the regular magnetic field from the dense gas clouds is suggested by the observed arm ",
    "interarm contrast in m51 .",
    "the basic parameters we adopt for m51 are : centre s right ascension @xmath17 and declination ( j2000 ) @xmath18 @xcite ; distance 7.6 mpc , @xcite , thus @xmath19 ; position angle of major axis @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is north ) and inclination @xmath22 ( @xmath21 is face - on ) @xcite .",
    "the inclination is measured from the galaxy s rotation axis to the line - of - sight , viewed from the northern end of the major axis , and its sign is important for the geometry of the model discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : b ] .",
    "m51 was observed in october 2001 at @xmath23 with the vla in the compact d configuration and in august 2001 at @xmath24 in the c configuration .",
    "two pointings of the array , at the northern and southern parts of the galaxy , were required to obtain complete coverage of m51 at @xmath23 .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated and imaged using standard aips procedures and vla calibration sources .",
    "after initial examination of the data and the flagging of bad visibilities , self - calibration was used .",
    "after correction for the pattern of the primary beam the two pointings at @xmath23 were mosaiced using the aips task ` ltess ` .",
    "the calibrated @xmath24 c - array uv - data were combined with existing @xmath24 d - array data @xcite .    a new @xmath3 map in total power and polarization is presented in fig .  [ fig:20 ] , based on the c - array data of @xcite combined with d - array data of @xcite .",
    "all of the observations were re - reduced for this work , the two data sets were combined and then smoothed to a resolution of @xmath25 to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the resulting maps at @xmath3 contain information on all scales down to the beamsize as the primary beam of the vla at @xmath3 in the d - array is @xmath26 , about twice the size of m51 on the sky .",
    "different weighting schemes were used in the final imaging of the data to produce maps with either high resolution ( natural weighting ) or high signal - to - noise ( uniform weighting ) and for a compromise between the two extremes ( robust weighting , obtained by setting the parameter ` robust=0 ` in the aips task ` imagr ` ) .",
    "maps of the stokes parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 were produced in each case .",
    "the optimum number of iterations of the clean algorithm used to produce the images was determined individually for each map . following slight smoothing ,",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 maps were combined to give the polarized intensity @xmath30 , using a first - order correction for the positive bias @xcite .",

    "noises in total and polarized emission , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : arminter ]    we wish to investigate the effect of magnetic field compression in the large - scale shocks associated with the spiral arms .",
    "in particular , how the regular and random magnetic field components are changed by the shocks and whether shock compression of isotropic random magnetic fields can produce enough anisotropic field to account for most of the polarized emission as inferred in sections  [ sec : dp ] and [ sec : b ] .",
    "we have carefully examined the azimuthal variations in the various maps at different radii : these emission profiles clearly demonstrate that there is not a simple azimuthal behaviour of any of the measured quantities .",
    "one can not identify `` typical '' arm to interarm contrasts .",
    "so we have used a mask to separate arm ( pixels in the mask set to @xmath33 ) and interarm ( mask pixels set to @xmath34 ) regions in each of the maps and hence calculate the average contrast over a wide radial range .",
    "we combined the co map of @xcite with the hi map of @xcite to produce a map of the total neutral gas density at @xmath35 resolution , assuming a constant conversion factor @xmath36 . the arm ",
    "interarm mask was determined by making a wavelet transform , using the mexican hat wavelet with a linear scale of about @xmath37 , of this map .",
    "this scale was selected by examining a range of transform maps : a @xmath37 scale wavelet produces transform coefficients that are continuously positive along spiral arms and continuously negative in interarm regions .",
    "also , @xmath37 seems reasonable as a typical width of the spiral arms in m51 .",
    "this mask was used to separate the arm and interarm components of each of the maps listed in table  [ tab : arminter ] , over the radial range @xmath38 , and then the average arm and interarm values were determined .",
    "in addition to the data in table  [ tab : arminter ] we also separated the rotation measures shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rm:15 ] into arm and interarm components .",
    "we calculated the average magnitude @xmath39 and standard deviation @xmath40 of @xmath41 and found that @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the interarm and @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the arms .",
    "this may indicate that the regular magnetic field is stronger in the interarm regions than in the arms .",
    "however , the interpretation is difficult as the @xmath41 distribution depends on the signal - to - noise ratio , which tends to be higher in the arms .",
    "the contrast in the neutral gas column density ( 2h@xmath46 + hi ) is compatible with what might be expected from compression by a strong adiabatic shock , @xmath47 where the superscripts @xmath48 and @xmath49 refer to downstream and upstream of the shock front .",
    "we note that the scale height of the gas layer @xmath50 is not expected to be much affected by the spiral pattern @xcite ; hi observations in the milky way suggest @xmath51@xmath52 in the outer milky way @xcite .      explaining the arm ",
    "interarm contrast in the observed radio intensity is a long - standing problem .",
    "@xcite argued that their @xmath3 observations of m51 are consistent with the density wave theory of @xcite .",
    "they assumed that both cosmic ray number density and the tangential magnetic field increase in proportion to the gas density at the spiral shock . the resulting arm ",
    "interam contrast in radio intensity , after taking into account of the telescope beamwidth , is expected to be of order @xmath53 or more .",
    "@xcite , using observations at a higher resolution , found that the shape of cross - sectional profiles across the radio intensity arms is not compatible with the density wave theory and concluded that the synchrotron emitting interstellar medium is _ not _ compressed by shocks and decouples from the molecular clouds as it traverses the arms .",
    "thus there is clearly a discrepancy between the physically appealing theory of @xcite and observations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that only a moderate increase in synchrotron emission in spiral arms is expected due to the parker instability : rather than being strongly compressed the regular magnetic field rises out of the disc , in loops with a scale of 5001000  pc .",
    "however , the substantial random component of the magnetic field in m51 may supress the instability or reduce it to a simple uniform buoyancy @xcite .",
    "furthermore we do not observe the periodic pattern of enhanced faraday rotation along the spiral arms that would be expected from the vertical magnetic fields at the loop footpoints ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rm:15 ] ) .    in this section",
    "we reconsider this question with additional emphasis on the polarized intensity . in sect .",
    "[ subsec : cr ] , we consider how shock compression affects the emission of cosmic - ray electrons at a _ fixed _ frequency .",
    "the effect of the modest observational resolution on the arm ",
    "interarm contrasts is discussed in sect .",
    "[ subsec : beam ] . in sect .",
    "[ subsec : comp ] we consider the case of compression of an isotropic random magnetic field and conclude that this may be the dominant origin of the arm ",
    "interam contrast in radio intensity only in the inner galaxy . finally , in sect .",
    "[ subsec : decomp ] we show how the decompression of an isotropic random magnetic field as it leaves the spiral arm affects the arm  interarm contrast .",
    "assuming that magnetic field is parallel to the shock front of the spiral density wave and is frozen into the gas , its strength increases in proportion to the gas density , @xmath54 , as appropriate for one - dimensional compression .",
    "the ultrarelativistic gas of cosmic rays , whose speed of sound is @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the speed of light , is not compressed in the arms .",
    "however , compression of magnetic field will affect the cosmic rays ( including the electron component ) because @xmath57 is an adiabatic invariant @xcite , where @xmath58 is the component of the particle momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field and @xmath59 is the particle lorentz factor .",
    "more precisely , only the part of the lorentz factor related to the particle velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field should be included , but we ignore this detail for a rough estimate . in terms of the larmor radius @xmath60 , one can write @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the electron charge , to obtain another form of the adiabatic invariant , @xmath63 , i.e.magnetic flux through the electron s orbit remains constant .",
    "for @xmath54 , we then obtain @xmath64 and @xmath65 , or @xmath66 .",
    "thus , compression of magnetic field leads to an increase in the lorentz factor of the cosmic - ray electrons , @xmath66 .",
    "if the initial range of the lorentz factors is @xmath67 , compression transforms it into @xmath68 such that @xmath69 . of course , the total number density of cosmic - ray particles does not change because the cosmic - ray gas is not compressed . adopting a power - law spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of relativistic electrons per unit volume in the range @xmath72 , the total number density of the particles follows as @xmath73 , where we have assumed that the energy spectrum is broad enough to have @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "however , the energy of each cosmic - ray particle increases as @xmath76 : the energy shifts along the energy ( or @xmath59 ) axis , and @xmath77 i.e. , the number density of particles with given @xmath59 increases with @xmath78 .",
    "now we can estimate the effect of compression on the synchrotron emissivity observed at a fixed frequency , @xmath79 and fixed frequency interval @xmath80 .",
    "denoting @xmath81 the arm ",
    "interarm contrast in @xmath82 we have @xmath83 since @xmath84 .",
    "note that the lorentz factor of the electrons which radiate at a fixed frequency @xmath85 reduces as @xmath86 increases , @xmath87 ; this also leads to an increase in the number of cosmic - ray electrons radiating at a given frequency after compression since @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "with @xmath90 and the arm - interarm density contrast of about four , the number of cosmic - ray electrons with a given @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath91 , and the synchrotron intensity in the spiral arms would then be 50100 times stronger than between the arms .",
    "there are other reasons to expect enhanced synchrotron emission in the arms as supernova remnants , sites of cosmic ray acceleration , are localized in the arms .",
    "however , table  [ con ] clearly shows that such an enormous contrast is not observed .",
    "it is plausible that cosmic rays are rather uniformly distributed in galactic discs and only weakly perturbed by the spiral arms ( section 3.10 of * ? ?",
    "* ) . during their lifetime within the galaxy , @xmath92 ,",
    "the cosmic ray particles become well mixed over distances of order @xmath93@xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the cosmic ray diffusivity .",
    "this scale exceeds the width of spiral arms , so diffusion can significantly reduce the arm - interarm contrast , but it can hardly result in the almost uniform distribution of cosmic rays which would explain the low contrasts in table  [ tab : arminter ] . anyway , even assuming that the cosmic ray intensity is the same within the ams and between them , the compression of magnetic field by a factor of four would result in an enhancement of the synchrotron emissivity by a factor 16 for @xmath96 , and this is already larger than what is observed . note that although the contrast in total radio emission given in table  [ tab : arminter ] includes the thermal radio emission , this is concentrated in the arms as can be seen in h@xmath97 images @xcite and so the actual contrast in synchrotron emissivity will be lower than the contrast in total radio emissivity .",
    "one factor that can help to explain the lower than expected arm - interam contrast in total radio emission ( which for simplicity we assume to be all synchrotron emission ) is the possibility that the compressed region is narrow compared to the width of the spiral arms . given",
    "the complex processes that take place as gas passes through the arms , such as the formation of molecular clouds and star formation , it is plausible that shock compression is followed by a decompression before the gas leaves the arms . then , if the compressed region is narrower than the telescope beam the observed contrast between the arm and interarm will be reduced .",
    "we can estimate the width of the compressed region that is compatible with the observations in table  [ con ] using @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the observed arm - interam contrast in total radio emission in the inner spiral arms ( which we assume to be all synchrotron emission to make a conservative estimate ) , @xmath100 is the expected contrast due to compressive effects in an adiabatic shock , @xmath101 is the beamwidth at our highest resolution and @xmath102 is the width of the compressed region .",
    "using the values of the parameters just quoted we obtain @xmath103 .",
    "@xcite showed that the ridge of strongest polarized emission ( tracing the peak of the compressed magnetic field ) is generally shifted upstream of the ridge of strongest co emission ( tracing the highest neutral gas density ) in m51 .",
    "we can assume that this shift is due to a spiral - shock triggering the formation of molecular clouds .",
    "the dense clouds will fill only a small fraction of the volume occupied by the ism and may become decoupled from the magnetic field threading the diffuse ism during their formation , as originally suggested in the case of m51 by @xcite , by @xcite for barred galaxies and with a plausible mechanism for the separation outlined in @xcite .",
    "we expect that the expansion of the compressed magnetic field will begin once the clouds have formed .",
    "thus after a time @xmath104 the ridge in strong radio emission will begin to decay . if we estimate the magnetic field strength to be @xmath105 ( sect .",
    "[ sec : spx ] ) then an alfvn wave will propagate over the compressed distance @xmath106 if the density , of the compressed diffuse gas in which the clouds are embedded , is @xmath107 .",
    "this density is not implausible if the upstream diffuse gas density is @xmath108 .",
    "so one possible explanation for the observed low arm - interam contrast in total radio emission , compared to that expected from a simple consideration of cosmic ray energies , is that the compressed region is narrower than the beam . in this case",
    "we estimate that the ridge in compressed magnetic field , along the upstream edge of the spiral arm , will be a few tens of parsecs wide .",
    "this possibility can be tested using higher resolution observations .",
    "the cosmic rays are not the only source of the arm - interam contrast in radio emission though : next we consider the effect of a large - scale shock on the regular and random components of the magnetic field .",
    "we consider compression of a partially ordered magnetic field by the spiral shock .",
    "we assume that the random magnetic field upstream of the shock is statistically isotropic but one - dimensional compression makes it anisotropic and so it contributes to the polarized radio emission but not to faraday rotation .",
    "we assume that both the spiral arms and the field lines of the large - scale magnetic field are logarithmic spirals with the pitch angles @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively . an acceptable estimate is @xmath111 , where negative values correspond to a trailing spiral .",
    "the formulae required to calculate the compression of a magnetic field with both regular and isotropic random components and the associated total and polarized synchrotron emission and faraday rotation are derived in appendix  [ cpomf ] . using these equations",
    "we now consider two cases that encompass the range of observed contrasts in polarized emission in m51 : the inner spiral arms , where there is a strong arm ",
    "interarm contrast in polarization of at least @xmath112 , and the average contrast of @xmath113 which is more representative of the greater radii .",
    "the upstream ratio of random to regular magnetic field strength @xmath114 and the increase in gas density @xmath115 , in regular field @xmath116 and in random field @xmath117 fields due to the shock are fixed and then the consequential increases in nonthermal @xmath118 and polarized @xmath119 emission across the shock are calculated .    firstly the inner arms . here",
    "we can obtain a reasonable match with the maximum observed arm ",
    "interarm contrasts @xmath99 ( assumed to be mostly synchrotron emission ) and @xmath120 ( a lower limit due to weak interarm intensity at @xmath121 resolution ) . with the parameters @xmath122 , i.e. the regular field",
    "is not increased by the shock  this can be justified , for example , if the regular magnetic field becomes detached from dense clouds as they form @xcite  and @xmath123 we obtain expected arm ",
    "interarm contrasts in synchrotron emission of @xmath124 and polarized emission of @xmath125 . if @xmath126 then the expected increase in polarization becomes much larger .",
    "for example , for @xmath127 we obtain @xmath128 : since we only have a lower limit on the observed @xmath119 we can not rule out this possibility . we conclude that in the innermost spiral arms ( @xmath129 ) anisotropic random magnetic fields produced by compression of the interstellar gas in the spiral arms can account for the observed increases in total and polarized radio emission .",
    "now for the average arm  interarm contrasts . here ,",
    "since the average contrast in polarization is @xmath130 , this requires no increase in regular magnetic field in the arm and also no anisotropy of the random magnetic field , but simultaneously we require a small increase in synchrotron emission @xmath131 .",
    "this is not possible in our model ; it is also unlikely to happen when galaxies contain strong spiral density waves .",
    "the closest we can come is to set @xmath122 coupled with a weak upstream random field @xmath132 and strong compression of the random field @xmath133 to produce the required contrast in total emission .",
    "then we can obtain arm ",
    "interarm contrasts of @xmath134 in total synchrotron emission and @xmath135 in polarization .",
    "however , @xmath132 is strongly contradicted by the equipartition estimates of the various field strengths in sect .",
    "[ sec : spx ] , which likely overestimate the strength of the regular field as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : dp ] and [ sec : b ] .    to summarise this subsection : enhancement of the regular and random magnetic field components parallel to a large - scale spiral shock can _ partly _ account for the observed arm - interam contrasts in radio emission but no single set of parameters is compatible with the full range of the observations .      finally , we consider the _ decompression _ of an isotropic field as the magnetized gas flows from a high density to a low density region .",
    "this decompression also leads to the generation of an anisotropic random magnetic field , as the field component parallel to lines of constant density increases while the perpendicular component is unaffected , similar to the compressive case .",
    "but decompression will also help to lower the arm - interam contrast in nonthermal emission , thus alleviating one of the difficulties encountered in the previous subsection , if the random field in the arms is ( partly ) isotropized : this can readily occur due to turbulence being driven by star formation activity and the expansion of supernova remnants .",
    "first consider the case of straightforward compression .",
    "let us define the @xmath136-direction as perpendicular to the shock and the @xmath137-direction as parallel : so only @xmath137-components of the magnetic field are affected by the shock . thus @xmath138 and @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 refer to upstream and downstream and @xmath142 is the total random field .",
    "now the plane - of - sky component of the random field is @xmath143 so we obtain @xmath144 for an adiabatic shock , where @xmath145 .",
    "so we expect adiabatic compression in a simple , plane parallel shock to produce a contrast in nonthermal emission @xmath146 , in the case that the cosmic rays are smoothly distributed .",
    "this is a simplified version of part of the calculation described above and in detail in appendix  [ cpomf ] .",
    "now consider the case of decompression .",
    "we follow a similar calculation but here @xmath147 which leads to @xmath148 in this case the arm is the upstream region so the expected arm - interam contrast in nonthermal emission is @xmath149 which is close to the average contrast observed ( table  [ con ] ) .      in sect .",
    "[ sec : dp ] and [ sec : b ] we have shown that much of the polarized emission detected across the disc of m51 must come from anisotropic random fields . combined with the problem described in sect .",
    "[ subsec : comp ] above , of how isotropic random fields can be compressed in a spiral shock but not produce an increase in polarized emission , we are led to the view that anisotropic random fields are already present in interarm regions , perhaps as a result of enhanced localised shear or decompression .",
    "@xcite showed that the orientation of the magnetic field in m51 varies in azimuth by @xmath150 and in the interarm generally has a different pitch angle to the co spiral arm , only becoming well aligned with the co arm at its location . in this case compression of the already anisotropic field in the spiral shock",
    "will only weakly amplify the random field and hence lead to a weak change in polarized emission .",
    "we conclude that the roughly constant average polarized emission across the arms and interam region can not be easily explained with simple models of shock compression of magnetic field , if one simultaneously considers the weak contrasts that are observed in the total emission .",
    "the arm - interarm contrast in the radio emission probably results from a complex interplay of compression _ and _ decompression of the dominant random field , occurring as the ism undergoes phase changes on its passage through the arms .",
    "in addition the thickness of the compressed regions compared to the width of the beam likely plays a role .",
    "* polarized emission ( @xmath151 ) is present throughout most of the disc of m51 . in some regions the strongest @xmath151 coincides with the location of the strong spiral arms as seen in co emission . in other regions @xmath151",
    "is concentrated in the interarm region , forming structures up to @xmath152 in size , reminiscent of the @xmath153-scale magnetic arms observed in ngc  6946 @xcite .",
    "the origin of these magnetic arms is still unknown . *",
    "the observed polarization angles trace spiral patterns with pitch angles similar to , but not always the same as , the gaseous spiral arms .",
    "the apparently ordered large - scale magnetic field responsible for the well aligned polarization angles does not produce a systematic pattern in faraday rotation , leading us to conclude that a large fraction of the polarized emission is caused by anisotropic small - scale magnetic fields ( where small - scale refers to sizes smaller than the beam , typically @xmath154@xmath155 ) : anisotropic random fields , whose anisotropy is caused by a large scale process and so is aligned over large distances , can produce well ordered polarization angles but a random faraday rotation distribution . *",
    "faraday depolarization , caused by faraday dispersion due to turbulent magnetic fields , leads to strong depolarization of the @xmath3 polarized emission from the disc . from the observed fluctuations in faraday depolarization we were able to estimate a typical of a turbulent cell as @xmath156 . *",
    "fourier filtering followed by averaging in sectors is necessary to reveal the contribution of the regular ( or mean ) magnetic field to the observed polarization signal .",
    "this allowed us to fit a model of the 3d regular magnetic field of m51 to the observations of polarization angles at @xmath157 . due to the strong depolarization at @xmath158 we were able to identify two different regular magnetic field patterns . in the thermal disc the regular field can be described as a combination of @xmath5 azimuthal modes , with the @xmath13 mode being the strongest : this combination can be the result of the strong two - armed spiral pattern modifying a dynamo generated @xmath13 mode ( the easiest to excite according to mean - field galactic dynamo theory ) .",
    "the pitch angle of the @xmath13 mode is similar at all radii . in the halo the observed polarization angles at @xmath158 ,",
    "whose emission from the thermal disc is heavily depolarized , reveal a @xmath6 azimuthal geometry for the regular magnetic field .",
    "the origin of this halo field is unclear . *",
    "interarm contrast in gas density and radio emission was compared to a model where a regular and ( isotropic ) random magnetic field is compressed by shocks along the spiral arms .",
    "we found that where a strong arm ",
    "interarm contrast in @xmath151 is observed , in the inner arms @xmath159 , amplification of the random magnetic field by compression can successfully explain the data , provided that the regular magnetic field is not significantly increased .",
    "this constraint is similar to that obtained for two barred galaxies in @xcite , where it was proposed that the regular magnetic field de - couples from molecular clouds as they rotate and collapse .",
    "we were unable to explain the average arm ",
    "interarm contrast in total and polarized radio emission , typical for much of the galaxy at @xmath7 , by a model involving shock compression of magnetic fields .",
    "even when the regular magnetic field is not compressed some increase in @xmath151 in the arms is expected from compression of the random field , whereas the average arm  interarm contrast in @xmath151 is about one : this problem could be resolved if the random field is isotropic in the arms and becomes anisotropic due to decompression as it enters the interam .",
    "alternatively , the compressed region of magnetic field may be sufficiently narrow ( with a width of about @xmath160 ) , as might occur if the molecular clouds are de - coupled from the synchrotron emitting gas , to reduce the arm  interarm contrast by the required degree .",
