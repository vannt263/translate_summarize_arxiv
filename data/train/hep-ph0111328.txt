    "the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) in 1964 together with the observed hubble expansion of the universe had established hot big bang cosmology @xcite as a viable model of the universe .",
    "the success of the theory of nucleosynthesis in reproducing the observed abundance pattern of light elements together with the proof of the black body character of the cmbr then imposed hot big bang as the standard cosmological model .",
    "this model combined with grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite of strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions provides an appropriate framework for discussing the very early stages of the universe evolution .    despite its great successes , the standard big bang ( sbb ) cosmological model had a number of long - standing shortcomings .",
    "one of them is the so - called horizon problem .",
    "the cmbr which we receive now has been emitted from regions of the sky which never communicated causally before sending light to us .",
    "the question then arises how come the temperature of the black body radiation from these regions is so finely tuned as the measurements of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) @xcite show .",
    "another issue is the flatness problem .",
    "the present universe appears almost flat .",
    "this requires that , in its early stages , the universe was flat with a great accuracy , which needs some explanation .",
    "also , combined with guts which predict the existence of superheavy magnetic monopoles @xcite , the sbb model leads @xcite to a cosmological catastrophe due to the overproduction of these monopoles .",
    "finally , the model does not explain the origin of the small density perturbations required for the structure formation in the universe @xcite and the generation of the observed @xcite temperature fluctuations in the cmbr .",
    "inflation @xcite offers an elegant solution to all these problems of the sbb model .",
    "the idea behind inflation is that , in the early universe , a real scalar field ( the inflaton ) was displaced from its vacuum value .",
    "if the potential energy density of this field happens to be quite flat , the roll - over of the field towards the vacuum can be very slow for a period of time . during this period ,",
    "the energy density is dominated by the almost constant potential energy density of the inflaton . as a consequence ,",
    "the universe undergoes a period of quasi - exponential expansion , which can readily solve the horizon and flatness problems by stretching the distance over which causal contact is established and reducing any pre - existing curvature in the universe .",
    "it can also dilute adequately the gut magnetic monopoles .",
    "moreover , it provides us with the primordial density perturbations which are necessary for explaining the large scale structure formation in the universe @xcite as well as the temperature fluctuations observed in the cmbr .",
    "inflation can be easily incorporated in guts .",
    "it occurs during the gut phase transition at which the gut gauge symmetry breaks by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a higgs field , which also plays the role of the inflaton .",
    "after the end of inflation , the inflaton enters into an oscillatory phase about the vacuum .",
    "the oscillations are damped because of the dilution of the field energy density caused by the expansion of the universe and the decay of the inflaton into ` light ' matter .",
    "the radiation energy density generated by the inflaton decay eventually dominates over the field energy density and the universe returns to a normal big bang type evolution .",
    "the cosmic temperature at which this occurs is historically called ` reheat ' temperature although there is actually neither supercooling nor reheating of the universe @xcite .    an important disadvantage of the early realizations of inflation",
    "is that they require tiny coupling constants in order to reproduce the cobe measurements on the cmbr . to solve this ` naturalness ' problem ,",
    "the hybrid inflationary scenario has been introduced @xcite .",
    "the basic idea was to use two real scalar fields instead of one that was normally used .",
    "one field may be a gauge non - singlet and provides the ` vacuum ' energy density which drives inflation , while the other is the slowly varying field during inflation .",
    "this splitting of roles between two fields allows us to reproduce the temperature fluctuations of the cmbr with ` natural ' ( not too small ) values of the relevant parameters in contrast to previous realizations of inflation .",
    "hybrid inflation , although initially introduced in the context of non - supersymmetric guts , can be ` naturally ' incorporated @xcite in supersymmetric ( susy ) guts .",
    "unfortunately , the gut monopole problem reappears in hybrid inflation .",
    "the termination of inflation , in this case , is abrupt and is followed by a ` waterfall ' regime during which the system falls towards the vacuum manifold and starts performing damped oscillations about it .",
    "if the vacuum manifold is homotopically non - trivial , topological defects will be copiously formed @xcite by the kibble mechanism @xcite since the system can end up at any point of this manifold with equal probability .",
    "so a cosmological disaster is encountered in the hybrid inflationary models which are based on a gauge symmetry breaking predicting the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "one idea @xcite for solving the monopole problem of susy hybrid inflation is to include into the standard superpotential for hybrid inflation the leading non - renormalizable term .",
    "this term can not be excluded by any symmetries and , if its dimensionless coefficient is of order unity , can be comparable with the trilinear coupling of the standard superpotential ( whose coefficient is @xmath0 ) .",
    "actually , we have two options .",
    "we can either keep @xcite both these terms or remove @xcite the trilinear term by imposing an appropriate discrete symmetry and keep only the leading non - renormalizable term .",
    "the pictures which emerge in the two cases are quite different .",
    "however , they share an important common feature .",
    "the gut gauge group is already broken during inflation and thus no topological defects can form at the end of inflation . consequently",
    ", the monopole problem is solved .",
    "a complete inflationary scenario should be followed by a successful ` reheating ' satisfying the gravitino constraint @xcite on the ` reheat ' temperature , @xmath1 , and generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) . in hybrid inflationary models , it is @xcite generally preferable to generate the bau by first producing a primordial lepton asymmetry @xcite which is then partly converted into baryon asymmetry by the non - perturbative electroweak sphaleron effects @xcite . actually , in many specific models , this is the only way to generate the bau since the inflaton decays into right handed neutrino superfields .",
    "the subsequent decay of these superfields into lepton ( antilepton ) and electroweak higgs superfields can only produce a lepton asymmetry .",
    "successful ` reheating ' can be achieved @xcite in hybrid inflationary models in accord with the experimental requirements from solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations and with ` natural ' values of parameters .",
    "we will start with an introduction to the salient features of the sbb model @xcite and a summary of the history of the early universe in accordance to guts .      for cosmic times @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the planck scale ) after the big bang",
    ", the quantum fluctuations of gravity cease to exist .",
    "gravitation can then be adequately described by classical relativity .",
    "strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions , however , require relativistic quantum field theoretic treatment and are described by gauge theories .",
    "an important principle , on which sbb is based , is that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .",

    "this is the well - known hubble law asserting that all objects run away from each other with velocities proportional to their distances and is the first success of sbb cosmology .",

    "is called the ` last scattering surface ' since the cmbr observed now has been emitted from it .",
    "the particle horizon size at @xmath145 was @xmath149 and expanded until now to become equal to @xmath150 mpc .",
    "the angle subtended by this ` decoupling ' horizon at present is @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the sky splits into @xmath152 patches which never communicated causally before sending light to us .",
    "the question then arises how come the temperature of the black body radiation from all these patches is so accurately tuned as the results of cobe @xcite require .",
    "the present energy density of the universe has been observed @xcite to be very close to its critical energy density corresponding to a flat universe ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) implies that @xmath153 is proportional to @xmath154 , for matter dominated universe .",
    "thus , in the early universe , we have @xmath155 and the question arises why the initial energy density of the universe was so finely tuned to be equal to its critical value .",
    "this problem arises only if we combine the sbb model with guts @xcite which predict the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "as already indicated , according to guts , the universe underwent @xcite a phase transition during which the gut gauge symmetry group , @xmath105 , broke to @xmath112 .",
    "this breaking was due to the fact that , at a critical temperature @xmath156 , an appropriate higgs field , @xmath111 , developed a non - zero vev . assuming that this phase transition was a second order one , we have @xmath157 , @xmath158 , for the temperature dependent vev and mass of the higgs field respectively at @xmath159 ( @xmath160 is an appropriate higgs coupling constant ) .",
    "the gut phase transition produces monopoles @xcite which are localized deviations from the vacuum with radius @xmath161 , mass @xmath162 and @xmath163 at their center ( @xmath164 with @xmath165 being the gut gauge coupling constant ) .",
    "the vev of the higgs field on a sphere , @xmath166 , with radius @xmath167 around the monopole lies on the vacuum manifold @xmath168 and we , thus , obtain a mapping : @xmath169 .",
    "if this mapping is homotopically non - trivial the topological stability of the monopole is guaranteed .",
    "monopoles can be produced when the fluctuations of @xmath111 over @xmath170 between the vacua at @xmath171 cease to be frequent .",
    "this occurs when the free energy needed for @xmath111 to fluctuate from @xmath172 to zero in a region of radius equal to the higgs correlation length @xmath173 exceeds @xmath53 .",
    "this condition reads @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the difference in free energy density between @xmath170 and @xmath176 .",
    "the ginzburg temperature @xcite , @xmath177 , corresponds to the saturation of this inequality .",
    "so , at @xmath178 , the fluctuations over @xmath170 stop and @xmath179 settles on @xmath168 . at @xmath177 ,",
    "the universe splits into regions of size @xmath180 , the higgs correlation length at @xmath177 , with @xmath111 being more or less aligned in each region .",
    "monopoles are produced at the corners where such regions meet ( kibble mechanism @xcite ) and their number density is estimated to be @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is a geometric factor .",
    "the ` relative ' monopole number density then turns out to be @xmath183 .",
    "we can derive a lower bound on @xmath184 by employing causality .",
    "the higgs field @xmath111 can not be correlated at distances bigger than the particle horizon size , @xmath185 , at @xmath177 .",
    "this gives the causality bound @xmath186 which implies that @xmath187 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of monopoles , after @xmath177 , is governed by @xcite @xmath188 where the first term in the rhs ( with @xmath130 being an appropriate constant ) describes the dilution of monopoles by their annihilation with antimonopoles , while the second term corresponds to their dilution by hubble expansion .",
    "the monopole - antimonopole annihilation proceeds as follows .",
    "monopoles diffuse towards antimonopoles in the plasma of charged particles , capture each other in bohr orbits and eventually annihilate . the annihilation is effective provided that the mean free path of monopoles in the plasma does not exceed their capture distance .",
    "this holds for @xmath189 .",
    "the overall result is that , if the initial relative monopole density @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) , the final one @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "this combined with the causality bound yields @xmath194 .",
    "however , the requirement that monopoles do not dominate the energy density of the universe at nucleosynthesis gives @xmath195 and we obtain a clear discrepancy of about ten orders of magnitude .      for structure formation @xcite in the universe , we need a primordial density perturbation , @xmath196 , at all length scales with a nearly flat spectrum @xcite .",
    "we also need an explanation of the temperature fluctuations of the cmbr observed by cobe @xcite at angles @xmath197 which violate causality ( see sect.[subsec : horizon ] ) .",
    "let us expand @xmath198 in plane waves @xmath199 where @xmath17 is a ` comoving ' vector in 3-space and @xmath200 is the ` comoving ' wave vector with @xmath201 being the ` comoving ' wave number ( @xmath202 is the ` comoving ' wave length and the physical wave length is @xmath203 ) . for @xmath204 , the time evolution of @xmath205",
    "is described by the newtonian equation @xmath206 where the second term in the left hand side ( lhs ) comes from hubble expansion and the third is the ` pressure term ' ( @xmath207 is the velocity of sound given by @xmath208 ) .",
    "the rhs corresponds to the gravitational attraction .    for the moment ,",
    "put @xmath209=0 ( static universe ) .",
    "there exists then a characteristic wave number @xmath210 , the jeans wave number , given by @xmath211 and having the following property . for @xmath212",
    ", pressure dominates over gravitational attraction and the density perturbations just oscillate , whereas , for @xmath213 , attraction dominates and the perturbations grow exponentially .",
    "in particular , for ` matter ' , @xmath214 and all scales are jeans unstable with @xmath215    now let us take @xmath216 . since the cosmological expansion pulls the particles apart , we get a smaller growth : @xmath217 in the matter dominated case . for ` radiation ' ( @xmath218 ) , we get essentially no growth of the density perturbations .",
    "this means that , in order to have structure formation in the universe , which requires @xmath219 , we must have @xmath220 at the ` equidensity ' point , since the available growth factor for perturbations is given by @xmath221 .",
    "the question then is where these primordial density perturbations originate from .",
    "inflation @xcite is an idea which solves simultaneously all four cosmological puzzles and can be summarized as follows .",
    "suppose there is a real scalar field @xmath111 ( the inflaton ) with ( symmetric ) potential energy density @xmath222 which is quite flat near @xmath170 and has minima at @xmath223 with @xmath224 . at high enough @xmath53 s , @xmath170 in the universe due to the temperature corrections to @xmath222 . as @xmath53 drops , the effective potential approaches the @xmath53=0 potential but a little potential barrier separating the local minimum at @xmath170 and the vacua at @xmath225 still remains",
    "at some point , @xmath111 tunnels out to @xmath226 and a bubble with @xmath227 is created in the universe .",
    "the field then rolls over to the minimum of @xmath222 very slowly ( due to the flatness of the potential ) . during this slow roll - over ,",
    "the energy density @xmath228 remains essentially constant for quite some time .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath229 gives the energy momentum tensor @xmath230 which during the slow roll - over takes the form @xmath231 .",
    "this means that @xmath232 , i.e. , the pressure is negative and equal in magnitude with the energy density , which is consistent with ( [ eq : continuity ] ) .",
    "as we will see , @xmath12 grows fast and the ` curvature term ' , @xmath233 , in ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) diminishes .",
    "we thus get @xmath234 which gives @xmath235 , @xmath236 .",
    "so the bubble expands exponentially for some time and @xmath12 grows by a factor @xmath237 between an initial ( @xmath238 ) and a final ( @xmath239 ) time .",
    "the inflationary scenario just described , known as ` new ' @xcite inflation ( with the inflaton starting from zero ) , is not the only realization of the idea of inflation .",
    "another possibility is to consider the universe as it emerges at @xmath240 .",
    "we can imagine a region of size @xmath241 ( the planck length ) where the inflaton acquires a large and almost uniform value and carries negligible kinetic energy",
    ". under certain circumstances , this region can inflate ( exponentially expand ) as @xmath111 rolls down towards the vacuum .",

    "the static solution which corresponds to the top ( saddle point ) of this potential barrier is called sphaleron @xcite and is given by @xmath820 where @xmath821 , @xmath822 is the radial unit vector in 3-space and the 3-vector @xmath823 consists of the pauli matrices .",
    "the functions @xmath824 , @xmath825 , which can be determined numerically , tend to zero as @xmath826 and to 1 as @xmath827 .",
    "the mass ( static energy ) of the sphaleron solution is estimated to be @xmath828 and lies between 10 and 15 tev .    at @xmath829",
    "the tunneling from @xmath768 to @xmath800 is utterly suppressed @xcite by the factor @xmath830 . at high @xmath53 s , however , thermal fluctuations over the potential barrier are frequent and the tunneling rate is @xcite enhanced . for @xmath831 ( @xmath156 is the critical temperature of the electroweak transition ) , this rate is calculated @xcite by expanding around the sphaleron .",
    "we find @xmath832 for a second order electroweak transition , @xmath833 , @xmath834 . we can then show that @xmath835 for @xmath53 s between @xmath836 and @xmath837 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath838 , where the sphaleron ceases to exist , it was argued @xcite that we still have @xmath835 .",
    "the overall conclusion is that non - perturbative baryon and lepton number violating processes are in equilibrium in the universe for @xmath839 .",
    "note that @xmath656 is conserved by these processes .",
    "given a primordial lepton asymmetry , one can calculate @xcite the resulting @xmath840 . in mssm",
    ", the @xmath754 instantons produce the effective operator @xmath841 and the @xmath842 instantons the operator @xmath843 where @xmath788 and @xmath844 are the quark and lepton @xmath754 doublets , @xmath845 and @xmath846 the up and down type antiquark @xmath754 singlets , @xmath847 the higgs @xmath754 doublet which couples to down type quarks , @xmath268 and @xmath466 the gluons and @xmath466 bosons , and tilde denotes the superpartner .",
    "these interactions as well as the usual mssm interactions are in equilibrium at high @xmath53 s .",
    "the equilibrium number density of an ultrarelativistic particle species @xmath848 is given by @xmath849 where @xmath268 is the number of internal degrees of freedom of the particle , @xmath625 its chemical potential and @xmath850 or 1 for bosons or fermions .",
    "for each interaction in equilibrium , the algebraic sum of the @xmath625 s of the particles involved is zero .",
    "these constraints leave only two independent chemical potentials , @xmath851 and @xmath852 .",
    "the baryon and lepton asymmetries are then expressed @xcite as @xmath853 @xmath854 where @xmath855 is a known @xcite function .",

    "in particular , the non - vanishing gaugino mass implies @xmath858 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bla ] ) then gives @xcite @xmath859 equating @xmath860 with the primordial @xmath861 , we get @xmath862 , for @xmath863 .",
    "note that it is crucial to generate a primordial @xmath860 and not only a @xmath840 ( and @xmath861 ) since otherwise the final @xmath840 will vanish .",
    "this is another reason which disfavors the creation of the bau via the decay of superheavy color ( anti)triplets since their interactions usually conserve @xmath656 .",
    "we have summarized the shortcomings of the sbb model .",
    "we have then shown how they are resolved by inflationary cosmology which suggests that the universe , in its early stages , underwent a period of exponential expansion driven by an almost constant ` vacuum ' energy density .",
    "this may have happened during the gut phase transition at which the higgs field which breaks the gut gauge symmetry was displaced from the vacuum .",
    "this field ( inflaton ) could then , for some time , roll slowly towards the vacuum providing the ` vacuum ' energy density .",
    "inflation generates the primordial density perturbations which are necessary for the large scale structure formation in the universe and the observed temperature fluctuations of the cmbr . after the end of inflation",
    ", the inflaton performs damped oscillations about the vacuum and eventually decays into light particles ` reheating ' the universe .",
    "the early realizations of inflation required ` unnaturally ' small coupling constants .",
    "this problem was solved by the so - called hybrid inflationary scenario which uses two real scalar fields instead of one that was customarily used .",
    "one of them provides the ` vacuum ' energy density for inflation while the other one is the slowly rolling field .",
    "hybrid inflation arises ` naturally ' in many susy guts .",
    "however , the cosmological disaster from the overproduction of gut monopoles , which was avoided in earlier inflationary models , reappears in hybrid inflation .",
    "we have constructed two ` natural ' extensions of susy hybrid inflation which do not suffer from the monopole problem .",
    "we have shown that successful ` reheating ' satisfying the gravitino constraint on the ` reheat ' temperature takes place after the end of inflation in all three versions of hybrid inflation we have considered here .",
