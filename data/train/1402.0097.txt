    "silica ( sio@xmath1 ) is the most commonly used substrate for graphene - based devices , and while it offers many advantages , there are also several drawbacks .",
    "graphene supported on sio@xmath1 exhibits an electron mobility that is 10 times lower than that of the structure suspended in vacuum@xcite , owing to the interfacial charge impurities,@xcite surface roughness,@xcite and surface optical phonons@xcite of the silica substrate .",
    "further , the roughness of the silica surface results in nanometer - scale ripples@xcite in graphene .",
    "hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) is a iii - v compound similar to graphite and consists of equal numbers of boron and nitrogen atoms ; it is a chemically and thermally stable dielectric material with an optical band gap of @xmath26 ev.@xcite since graphene devices on hbn have a much higher carrier mobility@xcite than devices on sio@xmath1 , the lack of surface dangling bonds , small roughness , and slight lattice mismatch@xcite with graphene mean that high - quality graphene devices could be realized using a few - layer hbn film as an insulating substrate .",
    "monolayer hbn , also known as `` white graphene , '' can be peeled off from bulk hbn by mechanical cleavage,@xcite although chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) is generally used to produce large - area hbn sheets.@xcite recently , a graphene monolayer was directly grown on a cvd - grown hbn film@xcite ; the monololayer grown in this manner enabled superior electronic properties as compared to those in the case of graphene transferred to the hbn film . however , growing hbn sheets via cvd leads to the introduction of native defects.@xcite    more recently , van der waals ( vdw ) heterostructures , comprising graphene and other two - dimensional atomic crystals such as hbn , mos@xmath1 , and ws@xmath1 , have been produced and examined in this emerging research field of condensed matter physics.@xcite these heterostructures are expected to show new physics . although the vdw interaction is much weaker than covalent bonding , it is sufficiently strong to maintain the stacking of two - dimensional atomic crystals .",
    "thin hbn layers can serve , not only as good substrates , but also as protective covers for graphene.@xcite another attractive topic is the vertical devices or tunneling heterostructures composed of graphene and few - layer - thick crystals of hbn or transition metal dichalcogenide.@xcite these devices constitute a new type of electronic devices .",
    "the interfacial coupling in the vdw heterostructures could be enhanced through different phenomena , for instance , interfacial contamination by adsorbates and native defects @xcite . at such a contaminated interface ,",
    "localized gap states originating from the vacancies or intercalated metal atoms could cause electronic scattering near the fermi level ( @xmath3 ) of the graphene sheet .    in this paper ,",
    "we report a first - principles study of the structural and electronic properties of a graphene / hbn heterostructure containing defects .",
    "we consider metal impurity atoms on the hbn sheet as extrinsic defects and vacancies in hbn as intrinsic defects .",
    "the electronic structure is calculated to determine the energies of the defect states ; the results show that the interlayer coupling is enhanced in the presence of the defects .",
    "the defect - mediated interfacial coupling leads to residual electronic scattering in graphene / hbn heterostructures containing defects such as vacancies and adsorbed impurity atoms .",
    "this in turn may be the origin of charge doping and residual electronic scattering in graphene .",
    "we adopted the vdw - corrected density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite to investigate the structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of a graphene / hbn heterostructure . to examine the effects of an impurity metal atom",
    ", we included a li , k , cr , mn , co , or cu atom between the hbn and graphene sheets in our model . to examine the coulomb interaction and/or the orbital hybridization of the intercalated atom , we introduced metal atoms ( li , k , cr , mn , co , and cu ) . the ionic or covalent bonding can enhance the interlayer coupling between graphene and hbn .",
    "in particular , an alkali metal , such as li and k , can easily donate an electron to the sheets .",
    "we compared the li and k atoms with regard to the dependence of the metal atom radius on the deformation and the amount of donated charge . because of the presence of _ d _ orbitals , 3_d _ transition metal atoms may have strong coupling to the graphene and hbn layers .",
    "in addition , as the transition metal atoms may cause a spin magnetic moment , we considered cr , mn , and co atoms as magnetic dopants .",
    "copper surfaces have been used for the cvd growth of graphene and hbn sheets . if the cu atoms or nanoclusters are not completely removed from the hbn or graphene sheet after the growth",
    ", the graphene / hbn heterostructure may contain copper impurity atom(s ) at the interface .",
    "thus , we also considered cu as an impurity . during the cvd growth of the hbn sheet , monovacancies and triangular defect structures such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 defects",
    "can be formed@xcite [ @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is a multi - vacancy in which one nitrogen ( boron ) and three boron ( nitrogen ) atoms are missing ] .",
    "thus , we considered four different vacancy structures in hbn : a single boron vacancy ( @xmath6 ) ; a single nitrogen vacancy ( @xmath7 ) ; and the two triangular vacancies , @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "our supercell was an orthorhombic cell containing a graphene sheet and an hbn sheet .",
    "the cell size was 17.18 @xmath8 14.96 @xmath8 25.00 @xmath9 , with the vacuum region being about 22   thick .",
    "all the model systems were relaxed until the residual atomic forces were less than 0.02 ev@xmath10@xmath11 . to describe the interaction between the electrons and ions , we used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with a functional form proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite an energy cutoff of 400 ev and a @xmath12-centered 3 @xmath8 3 @xmath8 1 @xmath13-point sampling were employed to calculate the total energy and to obtain fully relaxed geometries .",
    "we used a grid of 6 @xmath8 6 @xmath8 1 @xmath13-points to plot the density of states and charge densities .",
    "the vdw interaction was also considered to precisely describe the structural properties between the two layers . in the calculations",

    "a hubbard @xmath17 term was added to the dft functional ( i.e. , the gga+@xmath17 method ) .",
    "we consider the most stable stacking configuration among three inequivalent configurations@xcite in the absence of any defects [ figure 1(a ) ] .",
    "the most stable structure is realized with bernal ( ab ) stacking of the hbn and graphene sheets , in a manner similar to that of graphite , where the nitrogen atom is located above the center of the graphene hexagons , as shown in figure 1(a ) . in the fully optimized (",

    ", the electron donations of the 3@xmath15 transition metal atoms depend on the @xmath18 values . as @xmath18 increases , the amount of donated electron _ decreases _ slightlyfor the cr and cu atoms . electron configurations of cr and cu are [ ar]@xmath19@xmath20 and [ ar]@xmath21@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "this observation implies that the localization of the 3@xmath15 electrons prevents the electron donation from the impurity atom to the sheets .",
    "in contrast , the amount of donated electron _ increases _",
    "slightly for the co atom ( [ ar]@xmath22@xmath23 ) with increasing @xmath18 values . on the other ,",
    "the mn atom ( [ ar]@xmath19@xmath23 ) does not exhibit any monotonic change with increasing @xmath18 values .",
    "for the spin magnetic moment , all the transition metal atoms that we consider show increasing magnetic moments as @xmath18 increases .",
    "figure 3 shows the total dos of the sandwich structures and the pdos for each value of @xmath18 . for @xmath24 ev , except in the case of the cu impurity , the 3@xmath15 states of the transition metals with majority spin lie between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ev . the mn and co atoms , in particular , have strong peaks very close to @xmath3 for the spin - down electron .",
    "in addition , the co atom gives rise to magnetic impurity states .",
    "these results are similar to those previously reported for mn and co adsorption on graphene.@xcite near the fermi level , the pdos of co originates mainly from the @xmath27 orbital , while that of mn originates from the @xmath28 orbitals . as @xmath18 increases , the occupied 3@xmath15 states move deeper inside the valence band .",

    "if we assume that the neighboring n atoms form an equilateral triangle , then their dangling bonds ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) can be weakly coupled and produce three localized energy eigenstates ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ) .",
    "@xmath41 denotes electronic states of dangling bonds . in spite of the disconnection of @xmath34 electrons of three n atoms , their energy levels are not much affected by the vacancy",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath34 electrons are localized at the n sites in a perfect hbn . in the case of the @xmath7 defect , however , the lowest unoccupied level is composed of @xmath34 electrons at the b site . thus , both @xmath34 and @xmath32 electrons should be considered as gap states : @xmath42 here , @xmath38 is the lowest - energy defect state , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are degenerate states with a higher energy .",
    "it has been reported@xcite that the @xmath6 defect lowers its symmetry from @xmath43 to @xmath44 via the jahn  teller distortion , and therefore , the degeneracy disappears and an energy splitting of the occupied degenerate defect states occurs .",
    "figures 4(b ) and 4(c ) show that @xmath6 produces four localized defect states : a , b , b@xmath31 , and a@xmath31 .",
    "state b is located at @xmath3 but it has @xmath32-bonding characteristics .",
    "therefore , this state has negligible hybridization with the graphene states with @xmath34-bonding characteristics .",
    "states b@xmath31 and a@xmath31 are around @xmath141 ev in the conduction band .",
    "the localized states b and b@xmath31 would be at the same energy level if there were no interaction between the graphene and hbn sheets . because of an exchange splitting of @xmath21 ev , the spin - degenerate state ( @xmath39 ) is separated into two .",
    "thus , the partial charge densities of state b for the spin - up electron and state b@xmath31 for the spin - down electron have the practically identical shape .",
    "electron transfer takes place from graphene to hbn , and the fermi level decreases in energy.@xcite our bader charge analysis also supports electron donation ( @xmath20.5 @xmath30 ) from graphene to hbn .",
    "in fact , the spin magnetic moment of @xmath21.5 @xmath45 induced by @xmath6 is associated with this electron transfer . according to huang _",
    "et al._,@xcite the spin magnetic moment induced by @xmath6 is 1.0 @xmath45 in the absence of graphene . in the absence of the graphene monolayer",
    ", we found that there were one and two unoccupied defect levels of the spin - up and spin - down electrons , respectively , above the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of hbn , which have @xmath32-bonding characteristics , as shown in figure 4(d).@xcite in the presence of the interaction with graphene , the charge ( @xmath20.5 @xmath30 ) transferred from graphene increases the spin magnetic moment ( 1.0 @xmath45 @xmath46 1.5 @xmath45 ) in hbn and account for the partially occupied state b and the two unoccupied defect levels that correspond to states b@xmath31 and a@xmath31 in figure 4 .",
    "the lowest defect state @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is located inside the valence band ( state a ) , while @xmath40 corresponds to state a@xmath31 .    in the case of a nitrogen monovacancy ( @xmath7 ) , the b ",
    "n bonds around @xmath6 have shorter lengths of 1.41  , and in contrast to @xmath6 , @xmath7 does not produce a spin magnetic moment . for a bare hbn sheet , @xmath7 has a total spin magnetic moment of 1 @xmath45 .",
    "since about one electron is donated from hbn to graphene , the fermi level increases in energy and graphene becomes @xmath0-doped .",
    "interestingly , the electron transfer cancels the spin magnetic moment .",
    "three localized states can be distinguished clearly in the dos : one around @xmath3 and two around 1.4 ev that are nearly degenerate .",
    "this is reflected in the large difference in the peaks c and d of the pdos .",
    "since the @xmath7 defect preserves the symmetry of @xmath43 and the energy degeneracy is not broken,@xcite state c corresponds to @xmath38 and state d to a linear combination of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the absence of graphene , one spin - up",

    "these two energy levels for spin - up and spin - down are related to peak c in figure 5(b )",

    "[ fig6 ] ]    we now turn our attention to two smallest triangular defect structures : @xmath4 and @xmath5 . after geometry optimization ,",
    "the distance between two boron atoms in @xmath4 decreases to 1.94   [ figure 6(a ) ] , whereas the surrounding b ",
    "n bonds become slightly weaker and their lengths increase to 1.50  .",
    "the geometrical structure of the hbn sheet in the graphene / hbn heterostructure is very similar to that of a free - standing hbn sheet in the case of a @xmath4 vacancy.@xcite for the @xmath5 defect , in contrast , the distance between two nitrogen atoms decreases to 1.65  , as displayed in figure 6(b ) , and the surrounding b ",
    "n bonds become slightly weaker , increasing in length to 1.52  .",
    "the dos in figure 6(c ) shows that the @xmath4 defect creates a localized state , corresponding to peak e , deep inside the conduction band , which is a bonding state of the three boron pairs , as shown in the partial charge density in figure 6(e ) .",
    "the @xmath5 defect induces one localized state ( f ) in the valence band and two localized states ( g and h ) in the conduction band .",
    "state f is an antibonding state of the three nitrogen pairs .",
    "the dos in figure 6(d ) shows that peak g is broader than peak h , indicating that state g has a stronger interaction with the graphene states , which is in agreement with the partial charge densities in figure 6(f ) .",
    "both of our model structures for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 defects are spin - unpolarized , and notably , there are no dangling bonds in these triangular defects after the geometry reconstruction . in addition , the defect states ( states e to h ) are relatively far from @xmath3 , which is in sharp contrast to the monovacancy cases ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 result in the deep levels b and c , respectively , which are close to @xmath3 .",
    "the electrical properties of graphene may be extremely sensitive to the environment .",
    "therefore , any external contamination easily degrades the conductance of graphene .",
    "although tremendous efforts have been made to prevent contamination at the interfaces , it is very difficult to completely remove the contamination . in the present study ,",
    "we have studied the influence of extrinsic defects , such as metal impurities , or intrinsic defects , such as vacancies , on the structural and electronic properties of the graphene / hbn heterostructure .",
    "we found that a single boron ( nitrogen ) vacancy in the hbn layer creates @xmath47-doped ( @xmath0-doped ) graphene and that metal atom impurities may increase the energy of the fermi level of graphene .",
    "boron and nitrogen monovacancies as well as mn and co impurity atoms produce deep levels due to gap states ( near the fermi level ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath4 and @xmath5 defects are expected to contribute less than monovacancies ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) to electronic scattering in the deposited graphene since their localized defect states are quite far from @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the graphene / hbn system with extrinsic contamination or intrinsic vacancy defects could exhibit poor performance since the imperfections impair the electrical conductivity due to residual scattering in applications such as field effect transistors .",

    "<S> hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) , a remarkable material with a two - dimensional atomic crystal structure , has the potential to fabricate heterostructures with unusual properties . </S>",
    "<S> we perform first - principles calculations to determine whether intercalated metal atoms and vacancies can mediate interfacial coupling and influence the structural and electronic properties of the graphene / hbn heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> metal impurity atoms ( li , k , cr , mn , co , and cu ) , acting as extrinsic defects between the graphene and hbn sheets , produce @xmath0-doped graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider intrinsic vacancy defects and find that a boron monovacancy in hbn acts as a magnetic dopant for graphene , whereas a nitrogen monovacancy in hbn serves as a nonmagnetic dopant for graphene . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the smallest triangular vacancy defects in hbn are unlikely to result in significant changes in the electronic transport of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> our findings reveal that an hbn layer with some vacancies or metal impurities enhances the interlayer coupling in the graphene / hbn heterostructure with respect to charge doping and electron scattering . </S>"
