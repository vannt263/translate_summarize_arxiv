    "sources that are good candidates for detection in the 50 - 100  gev regime in the 1fhl catalog appear similar in their gev properties to 1fhl  j1507.0 - 6223 , the _ fermi _ counterpart of hess  j1507 - 622  .",

    "for the purpose of this work , the subsample of the 1fhl that are good candidates for detection at energies above 50 - 100  gev and lack an identification is selected as source sample .",
    "the advantage of using the 1fhl catalog is the fact that it provides a homogeneous sky coverage .",

    "on the one hand source detection might be affected by the presence of galactic diffuse emission . on the other hand ,",
    "since there is some indication of sources clustering around the galactic plane , it could actually be expected to find an excess of sources at low galactic latitudes ( and also in the direction of the super - galactic north pole ) .",

    "[ sec : gal ] and [ sec : super ] is applied to unidentified sources in the 1fhl that were not flagged to be good candidates for detection above 50 - 100  gev .",
    "it would be expected that detection efficiency for theses sources is biased in a comparable way as for the sample of sources defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] .",
    "again , sources with galactic latitudes in between @xmath1  were excluded ( see sec .",

    "as a result , the location of these sources with respect to the super - galactic plane is compatible with a homogeneous distribution .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the indication of an inhomogeneous distribution found for the sample of sources given in tab . [ tab_sources ]",
    "is introduced by an inhomogeneous detection efficiency of _",
    "fermi_.    additionally , it is investigated if there is any correlation between the galactic latitude and the super - galactic latitude of the sources in fig .",
    "[ figure : corr ] . as a result",
    ", no evidence of an obvious correlation is found .",
    "the reason for the deficit of sources in the direction of the super - galactic north - pole is not know at the moment .    finally , the same procedure as in sec .",
    "[ sec : gal ] and [ sec : super ] is applied to the sample of 36 high - energy neutrino events detected by icecube @xcite . as a result of this investigation a @xmath3 of 0.143 ( galactic plane ) and 0.103 ( super - galactic plane )",
    "is found and thus the distribution of events is consistent with a homogeneous distribution for both cases .    to conclude , there are moderately significant indications that sources from the sample defined in sec .",

    "for this section it is assumed that the inhomogeneous distribution of sources with respect to the galactic and super - galactic plane is not a statistical fluctuation but rather reflects the true distribution of sources .",
    "the discussion in this section is based on the hypothesis that some of the sources located in the vicinity of the galactic plane from the sample defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] are of similar origin as hess  j1507 - 622 .",
    "it has to be noted that at the moment its not clear whether such a connection exists .",
    "the extended nature of hess  j1507 - 622  in the vhe gamma - ray range would favor a galactic origin .",
    "hess  j1507 - 622  is likely located at multiple - kpc distance as indicated by its compact appearance @xcite and its considerably absorbed potential x - ray counterpart @xcite . for the following discussion",
    "it is assumed that some of the sources in the sample defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] are located at a comparable distance .",
    "the typical flux above 10gev of theses sources is about @xmath4  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6 @xcite , resulting in a luminosity of about @xmath7  ergs@xmath6 , with @xmath8 being the typical distance to these objects . assuming ic up - scattering of cmb photons by highly energetic electrons as the dominating radiation mechanism ( cooling time of electrons with energy of 300gev of about @xmath9  years , * ? ? ? * ) then the energy in electrons would be about @xmath10  erg .",

    "finally , if it is assumed that @xmath11 such sources exist in the galaxy and their typical age is about @xmath12years ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion on hess  j1507 - 622  ) , then the typical rate for their formation would be @xmath13  yr@xmath6 for the galaxy or 100  gpc@xmath14yr@xmath6 ( assuming a density of milky way - type galaxies of 0.01  mpc@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "firstly , and more generally , here the implications of a source population connected to the super - galactic plane is explored .",
    "the typical distance of galaxies that form the super - galactic plane is a few tens of mpc @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath11 such sources their volume density would be roughly @xmath15  mpc@xmath14",

    "these energy requirements are very challenging for galactic type sources but can easily be accommodated by active galactic nuclei . in principle the energetics would be reduced if the emission is significantly beamed ( as it is the case for example for bl  lac type objects ) .    in this extragalactic scenario",
