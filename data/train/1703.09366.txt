    "photonic crystals are artificial periodic structures in which electromagnetic waves ( photons ) can be manipulated in an analogous way to the electrons in semiconductors @xcite . in particular",
    ", photonic crystals can be used as devices for confinement and light curving @xcite as well as a single frequency filter and a cavity for nanolasers @xcite . unlike the conventional optical fibers ( where the light propagates by successive total reflections leading to a significant loss of energy ) , in the so - called photonic fibers the light follows a practically loss - free path .    the discovery of topological insulators ( ti ) @xcite has rekindled interest in existence of nontrivial topological phases in optical systems . in particular ,",
    "photonic counterparts of quantum hall edge states have been predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite in systems with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in this paper we introduce an exactly solvable model of the photonic topological insulator ( pti ) and discuss its unusual properties .",
    "in particular , an explicit expression for the pti band structure ( spectrum ) @xmath3 with ti induced gap parameter @xmath4 has been obtained , leading to the gap dependent effective photon mass @xmath5 .",
    "recall that the electromagnetic response of an ordinary ( nontopological ) insulator is described by the maxwell action @xmath6 leading to conventional macroscopic fields describing electric polarization and magnetization @xmath7    @xmath8    what would be the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator ( ti ) ? the novel property of the ti is that it has a conductive surface .",
    "it means that for an incident electric field , a surface current will arise inducing a magnetic field in the material , that is magnetizing it . in other words , in the ti an electric field induces a magnetization .",
    "likewise , the magnetic field induces a dielectric polarization in the ti .",
    "these two phenomena result in appearance of the so - called magneto - electric effects .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that similar effects occur in axion like systems @xcite .",
    "thus , from the electrodynamic point of view , we can consider a ti as an axionic medium @xcite and , by analogy , add the following topological term to the conventional maxwell action @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath11 is a phenomenological model parameter that characterizes the topological phase of ti . with the introduction of the above axionic term , we arrive at the constitutive relations describing the macroscopic properties of the ti , namely :    @xmath12    @xmath13    to model a periodic photonic crystal , we assume that the above - introduced parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are periodic with a spacial period equal to @xmath17 , that is :    @xmath18",
