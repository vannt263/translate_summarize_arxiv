    "the most interesting collective effects in systems of excitons are the anticipated exciton bose condensation and superfluidity ( see refs .  1 - 7 and references therein ) . recently a number of publications reported on the detection of bose condensation and superfluidity of excitons in cu@xmath9o based on observations of changes in exciton luminescence spectra@xcite and ballistic transport of excitons,@xcite which have been discussed in literature.@xcite observations of condensation of indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells under strong magnetic fields",
    "have also been reported ( see ref .  15 , a theoretical discussion in refs .",
    "16 - 18 , and references therein ) . in this connection ,",
    "the detailed investigation of coherent exciton properties , whose detection could be used to reveal exciton bose condensation , seems to be important .",
    "if a system of excitons is in a bose condensed state , the mean values of the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the exciton with zero momentum in the ground state are not zero : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the ground state of the excitonic system with the average number of excitons @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the annihilation operator of an exciton with zero momentum , and @xmath14 is the number of excitons in the condensate .",
    "equation  ( 1 ) clearly shows that , as a result of the recombination ( generation ) of an exciton with zero momentum , a system of bose - condensed excitons transfers to the ground state , that differs from the initial one in the average number of excitons with momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the recombination of excitons with zero momentum leads to the appearance of a peak ( the so - called condensate peak ) in the excitonic luminescence spectrum at frequency @xmath16/\\hbar$ ] , where @xmath17 is the energy of the ground state of the excitonic system .",
    "if the exciton - exciton interaction is nonvanishing , then , in addition to the mean values defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , products of two annihilation ( creation ) operators of excitons with opposite momenta averaged over the ground state of the bose - condensed excitonic system ( the so - called anomalous averages ) are not zero : @xmath18    the unusual optical properties inherent in bose - condensed state of interacting excitons due to nonvanishing anomalous means  ( 2 ) are considered in this paper .",
    "it will be shown that due to the interaction with the electromagnetic field , the coherent recombination ( or generation ) , i.e. , the simultaneous recombination ( or creation ) of two excitons with opposite momenta , corresponding to anomalous averages  ( 2 ) is possible . in such processes , the occupation numbers of excitons with @xmath0 are unchanged , and the final state of excitons differs from the initial one only in the average number of excitons with zero momentum .",
    "in particular , after the two - exciton recombination , the average number of condensate excitons is reduced by two .",
    "the coherent two - exciton recombination can contribute , for example , to the stimulated two - photon emission or to raman light scattering ( rls ) by bose - condensed excitons .",
    "rls can also be accompanied by the coherent generation of two excitons . in these processes ,",
    "the momentum of the exciton - photon system is not conserved : the recoil momentum , equal to the change in the momentum of the electromagnetic field , is transferred to phonons or impurities.@xcite in this paper we consider the processes in which the recoil momentum is transferred to two optical phonons .",
    "such processes seem to be most probable in the excitonic system in cu@xmath9o crystal , which is one of most interesting crystals in view of the observation of exciton bose condensation .",
    "in fact , the radiative recombination accompanied by the transmission of the recoil momentum to one optical phonon is typical for excitons in cu@xmath9o.@xcite using the energy and momentum conservation laws , one can prove that , in a defect - free crystal , the coherent recombination of two excitons is possible only if the recoil momentum is transferred to two phonons .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the occupation numbers of optical phonons are small , therefore , it is most probable that the recoil momentum is transferred to two phonons generated in the process . if the phonon dispersion is negligible and the incident light frequency @xmath2 , a line in the spectrum of the stimulated two - phonon emission at @xmath5 and an anti - stokes component in the rls spectrum at @xmath6 should appear . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath1 is the optical phonon frequency .",
    "both these lines correspond to the coherent two - exciton recombination : the energy of the initial state of the system is higher than the energy of its final state by @xmath19 , where @xmath4 is the frequency corresponding to the recombination of an exciton with zero momentum . if @xmath7 , the rls spectrum should contain the anti - stokes component at @xmath6 , which corresponds to the coherent two - exciton recombination , and the stokes component at @xmath20 due to the coherent generation of two excitons .",
    "the stimulated emission of two photons is impossible in this case .",
    "the appearance of the lines at frequencies @xmath21 is possible only if the excitons are in the bose - condensed state , and after a transition to the normal state these lines should disappear .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 the stimulated two - photon emission with the coherent two - exciton recombination accompanied by the transmission of the recoil momentum to phonons",
    "is considered .",
    "the diagram technique is used to obtain the cross sections of two - photon processes involving the coherent two - exciton recombination ( or generation ) at finite temperatures .",
    "this approach allows one to express the appropriate elements of the @xmath22-matrix in a natural manner in terms of anomalous green s functions of bose - condensed excitons .",
    "the cross section of the stimulated two - photon emission with the coherent phonon - assisted two - exciton recombination is obtained , and its temperature dependence is studied .",
    "it turns out that this dependence can be nonmonotonic under certain conditions .",
    "namely , in a certain temperature interval below @xmath23 the cross section of the stimulated two - photon emission can increase with the growth of temperature and can become even higher than it is at @xmath24 .",
    "the causes of this unusual temperature dependence is investigated .",
    "section  3 is dedicated to rls accompanied by the coherent processes of two - exciton recombination or generation . in section  4",
    "the possibility of the experimental observation of the lines at frequencies @xmath21 corresponding to the stimulated two - photon emission and rls is analyzed .",
    "our numerical estimates for excitons in cu@xmath9o indicate that a spectral line at @xmath5 corresponding to the stimulated optical phonon - assisted two - exciton recombination can be detected and , therefore , can be used to reveal exciton bose condensation .",
