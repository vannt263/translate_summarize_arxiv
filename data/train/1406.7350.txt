    "<S> this suggests that the observed splitting is most likely due to quasiparticle tunneling across the qubit junctions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the transition frequency @xmath60 is periodic with periodicity 1 for each @xmath49 , @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> when quasiparticles are present on the three islands , the gate charges are given by @xmath61 , @xmath44 , with @xmath62 a random offset charge corresponding to a slowly varying background of trapped charges and @xmath63 the number of quasiparticles trapped on island @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> for most values of the offset charges , a change in the quasiparticle numbers on one or more islands will induce a change in @xmath38 comparable with the maximum modulation @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we discuss a model for the dynamics of quasiparticle tunneling in the pcq . due to the large size of island 3 , the changes in energy induced by changes in @xmath64 , and hence by the change of quasiparticle number on this island , are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we only consider the dynamics of @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the following , connected with quasiparticle tunneling events through junctions m1 , 12 , and 23 ( see fig .  [ fig1]b ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4]a : the only allowed processes are those accompanied by a change in qubit energy for m1 and 13 tunneling and those that maintain the qubit energy for 12 tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> the same type of selection rules were predicted in  @xcite for a pcq with three josephson junctions .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the selection rules for tunneling processes , we consider the block formed by islands 1 and 2 separately from the rest of the circuit . within this block </S>",
    "<S> , fast exchanges of quasiparticles can take place . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a quasiparticle in this block undergoes transitions between the islands at a rate in excess of 100 mhz , assuming that the quasiparticle energy does not exceed the superconducting gap by more than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption on the energy is reasonable given the temperature at which experiments are performed . </S>",
    "<S> quasiparticles transitions within this block are fast and therefore one peak is observed in spectroscopy due to motional narrowing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling of quasiparticles between this block and the neighbouring conductors ( m and 3 ) is a slow process which is observed spectroscopically . </S>",
    "<S> the measured tsf rate is therefore attributable to tunneling of quasiparticles between the block formed by island 1 and 2 and the rest of the circuit . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal equilibrium tunneling rate of quasiparticles between the block 12 and the neighboring junctions is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b , assuming a superconducting gap of 220  @xmath74ev . </S>",
    "<S> while at zero temperature transitions between block 12 and the neighbouring islands are forbidden , the rate is finite at finite temperatures due to the energy dependence of coherence factors  @xcite , resulting in a finite value of the transition rate ( see supplementary information material ) .    while at low temperatures the calculated rate is significantly lower than the measured rate , at high temperatures the calculated rate is in reasonable agreement with the measured rate . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the presence of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in the circuit , as previously identified in phase , charge , and transmon qubits  @xcite and recently in a fluxonium qubit  @xcite . at the lowest temperatures </S>",

    "<S> the measured quasiparticle tunneling rate is consistent with this density of quasiparticles and an effective temperature of quasiparticles in the range @xmath77 ( see supplementary information material ) . </S>",
    "<S> optimization of decoherence of superconducting flux qubits will have to be addressed both through large values of the @xmath58 ratio , to reduce dephasing , and through suitable shielding techniques to reduce the nonequilibrium quasiparticle density  @xcite , to reduce the role of quasiparticles in energy relaxation .     * </S>",
