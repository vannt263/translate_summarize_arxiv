    "in recent years , research related to the einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) entanglement in continuous - variable quantum information processing has become increasingly vital since it can be shared by two distant communicating parties and is used as the crucial resource for important applications such as quantum teleportation and superdense coding @xcite . compared to discrete variable entangled states , continuous variable entanglement such as epr entanglement @xcite",
    "is generated efficiently by a pair of squeezed light beams and utilized with expeditiousness in measurement of quantum states which is a critical step in quantum communication protocols @xcite .",
    "a device that is used to produce epr - like entangled states is a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) , which contains a cavity with a @xmath1 nonlinear crystal inside . via a strong undepleted coherent beam pumped to the crystal , two ingoing signals in vacuum state",
    "interact with two modes of the cavity separately , and generate two output beams which are squeezed in quadrature - phase amplitudes and considered as epr entanglement @xcite .",
    "epr entanglement between the two outgoing fields is measured by the two - mode squeezing spectra of the fields .",
    "a strong epr entanglement is denoted by a high degree of two - mode squeezing . as a quantum system in reality",
    "is sensitive to its external environment , it undergoes unwanted interaction with an external electromagnetic field as a `` heat bath '' @xcite .",
    "therefore the strength of epr entanglement generated by such an open system can be degraded due to transmission losses and decoherence , which leads to limited communication distance .",
    "thus methods to enhance epr entanglement are of interest to improve the quality of quantum communication .",
    "coherent feedback is a feedback loop which directly connects quantum optical components without employing any measurement apparatus in the loop @xcite .",
    "our previous work @xcite presents a dual - nopa coherent feedback scheme comprised by two nopas as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual - nopa - cfb ] .",
    "each nopa @xmath2 in the figure is simply denoted by a block with four inputs and two outputs .",
    "@xmath3 contains two modes @xmath4 and @xmath5 . ingoing signal @xmath6 and amplification loss @xmath7 interact with mode @xmath4 ; similarly @xmath8 and amplification loss @xmath9 interact with mode @xmath5 .",
    "the output @xmath10 of @xmath11 is connected to the input @xmath12 to @xmath13 , and the outgoing signal @xmath14 from @xmath13 is the input to @xmath11 .",
    "epr entanglement is generated between outputs @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a more detailed description of the nopa will be given in section [ sec : nopa ] .",
    "epr entanglement generated from a dual - nopa coherent feedback network where two nopas are placed at two endpoints ( alice and bob ) separately is compared to that of a single nopa located in the middle ( at charlie s ) , at a location between alice s and bob s , in @xcite .",
    "when amplification losses are neglected , under the same values of configuration parameters such as transmission losses , decay rates and pump power , the coherent feedback network improves epr entanglement between two outgoing fields in terms of increasing the level of two - mode squeezing that can be achieved over the single nopa , see @xcite .",
    "also , with the same setting of decay rates and when losses are neglected , the coherent feedback network requires less pump power to generate the same degree of two - mode squeezing compared to the single nopa .",
    "thus the coherent feedback scheme has improvement in epr entanglement generation .",
    "based on the above facts , we consider a system consisting of two nopas connected in a coherent feedback loop with a static passive linear network which is denoted by a @xmath0 complex unitary matrix @xmath17 , as shown in fig . [ fig : system ] .",
    "the passive linear network can be assembled by several static linear optical devices , such as beamsplitters and phase shifters , of which the transformation functions are @xmath18 unitary matrices @xcite .",
    "the epr entanglement between the continuous - mode fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 is of interest . the coherent feedback network in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual - nopa - cfb ] corresponds to a special case where @xmath17 takes on a particular value that will be given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scfb ] ) in section [ sec : system - model ] .",
    "epr entanglement is quantified by the amount of two - mode squeezing between the two fields at the frequency @xmath21 rad / s .",
    "the two - mode squeezing will be given by a certain nonnegative - valued function @xmath22 of the matrix @xmath17 ( to be defined in section ii - b ) , and strong epr entanglement corresponds to a small value of this function .",
    "thus , the aim of the paper is to optimize the two - mode squeezing by finding a local minimum ( denoted by @xmath23 ) of the real - valued function @xmath22 subject to the constraint that @xmath17 is unitary , which can be solved by a modified steepest descent algorithm on a stiefel manifold as proposed in @xcite , with @xmath24 as an initial point . via the decomposition of @xmath23 into the product of @xmath25 two - level unitary matrices",
    "@xcite , we can then find the configurations of optical devices that realizes the passive linear network @xmath23 .",
