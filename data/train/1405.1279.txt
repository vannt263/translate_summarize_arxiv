    "human societies have been successfully described within the framework of complex networks , where nodes and links denote individuals and their dyadic relationships , respectively  @xcite .",
    "as individuals are embedded in social networks , their positions in such networks strongly influence their behaviors  @xcite as well as self - evaluations  @xcite and subjective well - being  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the comparison to friends , colleagues , and peers enables individuals to adopt and transmit opinion , information , and technologies  @xcite , e.g. , for the competitiveness  @xcite . thus understanding positional differences between individuals is crucial to understand the emergent collective dynamics at the community or societal level  @xcite .",
    "topological structures of social networks have been known to be heterogeneous , characterized by broad distributions of the number of neighbors or degree  @xcite , assortative mixing  @xcite , and community structure  @xcite .",
    "one of interesting phenomena due to topological heterogeneities is the friendship paradox ( fp ) .",
    "the fp states that your friends have on average more friends than you do  @xcite .",
    "the paradox has been shown to hold in both offline and online social networks  @xcite .",
    "examples include friendship networks of middle and high school students  @xcite and of university students  @xcite , scientific collaboration networks  @xcite , and facebook and twitter user networks  @xcite .",
    "the paradox can be understood as a sampling bias in which individuals having more friends are more likely to be observed by their friends .",
    "this bias has important implications for the dynamical processes on social networks , e.g. , for efficient immunization  @xcite and for early detection of contagious outbreaks  @xcite or of natural disasters  @xcite .",
    "the paradox implies that your friends and neighbors tend to occupy more important or central positions in social networks than you do .",
    "the importance or centrality of individuals is not determined only by their topological positions in networks , but also influenced by their attributes .",
    "individuals can be described by various attributes like gender , age , cultural preferences , and genetic information  @xcite .",
    "this requires us to study the interplay between topological structure and node attributes of social networks .",
    "the friendship paradox has been also considered for arbitrary node attributes  @xcite , which is called generalized friendship paradox ( gfp )  @xcite .",
    "note that if the degree of node is considered as the attribute , the gfp reduces to the fp .",
    "the gfp can be formulated at the individual and network levels .",
    "the gfp holds for a network if the average attribute of nodes in the network is smaller than the average attribute of their neighbors .",
    "the gfp holds for a node if the node has lower attribute than the average attribute of its neighbors .",
    "the gfp at both levels has been observed in the coauthorship networks  @xcite . while the gfp at the network level accounts for the average behavior of the network",
    ", the gfp at the individual level can provide more detailed understanding of the centrality of individuals , and of their subjective evaluations of attributes .",
    "it is obvious that these individual properties can not be fully revealed in the network level analysis , especially when the individuals are heterogeneous , e.g. , in terms of broad distributions of degree and attribute .",
    "the origin of the gfp at the network level has been clearly shown to be rooted in positive degree - attribute correlations  @xcite .",
    "in other words , high attribute individuals are more likely to be observed by their friends as high attribute individuals have more friends . however , the role of degree - attribute correlations at the individual level is far from being fully understood . in order to investigate the role of various correlations for the gfp at the individual level , we first analyze a solvable model to characterize the paradox holding probability of nodes for the uncorrelated case .",
    "then we numerically study the correlated model of networks with tunable degree - degree and degree - attribute correlations . by calculating the paradox holding probabilities for the entire range of correlations ,",
    "we show that the relevance of degree - attribute correlation to the paradox holding probability may depend on whether the network is assortative or dissortative .",
    "this result is compared to the gfp at the network level .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper by summarizing the results .",
    "the generalized friendship paradox ( gfp ) holds for a network if the average attribute of nodes in the network is smaller than the average attribute of their neighbors . for a network of @xmath0 nodes ,",
    "let us denote a degree and an attribute of node @xmath1 as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the average degree and average attribute are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the average attribute of neighbors @xmath6 is obtained as @xmath7 where a node @xmath1 with degree @xmath2 has been counted @xmath2 times by its neighbors .",
    "then the gfp holds for a network if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath8 by the straightforward calculation , one gets @xmath9 where the degree - attribute correlation is given by @xmath10 since standard deviations of degree and attribute , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are positive in any non - trivial cases , the positive @xmath13 leads to the gfp at the network level .",
    "thus , the origin of gfp at the network level is rooted in positive correlation between degree and attribute  @xcite .",
    "the gfp at the network level has been observed in the coauthorship networks of physical review journals ( pr ) and of google scholar profiles ( gs ) for several attributes such as the number of publications by each author  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the negative @xmath13 can lead to the opposite tendency , implying that your friends have on average lower attribute than you do .",
    "this can be called anti - gfp .      in order to investigate the gfp at the individual level , we study an uncorrelated solvable model .",
    "the gfp holds for a node @xmath1 if the node has lower attribute than the average attribute of its neighbors , precisely if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the set of @xmath1 s neighbors .",

    "the value of @xmath39 is upper bounded by the probability that when two numbers are drawn from @xmath20 , both numbers are not smaller than @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "even when one neighbor has an attribute less than @xmath17 and the other has an attribute more than @xmath17 , it is likely that the average of them exceeds @xmath17 due to the broadness of @xmath20 .",
