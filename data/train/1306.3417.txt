    "high - energy neutrinos provide the `` smoking - gun '' signal of cosmic - ray ( cr ) acceleration  @xcite , and their detection with the icecube observatory has long been anticipated  @xcite . in 2012 ,",
    "the icecube collaboration announced the detection of two pev shower events observed during the combined ic-79/ic-86 data period  @xcite .",
    "a recent follow - up analysis  @xcite of the same data uncovered a spectrum of 26 additional events at lower energies .",
    "these new data are consistent with an isotropic neutrino background ( inb ) flux of @xmath7 ( per flavor ) around pev  @xcite , in agreement with the conventional waxman - bahcall bound  @xcite .",
    "a break / cutoff at @xmath8  pev is suggested for hard spectra with spectral indices of @xmath9 , since no events were found at higher energies where the effective area is larger especially due to the glashow resonance at 6.3  pev  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the icecube signal is unknown . among extragalactic neutrino sources , jets and cores of active galactic nuclei ( agn )  @xcite and @xmath1-ray burst ( grb ) jets  @xcite have been widely studied , where the photohadronic ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) reaction is typically the main neutrino generation process . on the other hand , large scale structures with intergalactic shocks ( igss ) and agn  @xcite , and starburst galaxies ( sbgs )  @xcite",
    "may significantly contribute to the inb mainly via the hadronuclear ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) reaction .",
    "it is crucial to discriminate @xmath0 and @xmath10 scenarios to identify the neutrino sources . in this work",
    ", we consider the @xmath0 origin and show that it can be tested with the multimessenger approach in the next several years .    recently",
    ", _ fermi _ improved limits on the diffuse isotropic @xmath1-ray background ( igb ) by @xmath11 times compared to egret  @xcite , so the known connection between the inb and the igb  @xcite leads to stronger constraints on neutrino emission .",
    "although @xmath10 emission , especially cosmogenic signal , has been the main interest  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath0 sources have not been explicitly studied .",
    "there is an important difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath10 cases . in @xmath10 scenarios ,",
    "secondary spectra typically have a strong energy dependence ( rising at @xmath12  gev energies ) due to the threshold and dominance of resonant channels .",
    "in contrast , the approximate feynman scaling of @xmath0 reactions leads to power - law secondary spectra stretching from gev energies , following the initial cr spectrum .",
    "hence , normalization of the neutrino spectrum at pev energies has immediate consequences on @xmath1-ray spectra at lower energies , giving us powerful constraints on @xmath0 scenarios .",
    "the new icecube data show that the total inb flux is _ comparable _ to the diffuse igb flux  @xcite .",
    "this enables us to obtain the allowed range in viable @xmath0 scenarios for the first time .",
    "our conclusion that the @xmath0 sources _ must _ have @xmath2 implies that the @xmath0 origin can be tested by ( a ) determining @xmath6 by icecube , ( b ) resolving sources by _ fermi _ and understanding the diffuse igb , and ( c ) observing more individual sources with tev @xmath1-ray telescopes , especially the future cherenkov telescope array ( cta )  @xcite .",
    "our results are insensitive to redshift evolution and even remain valid for galactic sources when we regard the observed neutrino flux as isotropic .",
    "we briefly discuss specific sources with a neutrino break / cutoff around pev . throughout this work ,",
    "we use @xmath13 and cosmological parameters with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we generally consider @xmath0 neutrinos produced inside the sources , which more specifically include galaxy clusters ( gcs ) and star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) . for the @xmath0 reaction at sufficiently high energies ,",
    "the typical neutrino energy is @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the proton energy in the cosmic rest frame and @xmath19 is the typical source redshift .",
    "neutrinos around a possible @xmath20  pev break come from protons with energies close to the _ second / iron knee _  @xcite .",
    "note that the neutrino energy is less for nuclei with the same energy , since the energy per nucleon is lower .",
    "the energy per nucleon should exceed the _ knee _ at @xmath21  pev .    given the differential cr energy budget at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the inb flux per flavor",
    "is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath24(e_pq_{e_p})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25  gyr and @xmath26 is the redshift evolution factor  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 efficiency is @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 at @xmath5  pev  @xcite , @xmath30 is the typical target nucleon density , @xmath31 $ ] is the duration that crs interact with the target gas , @xmath32 is the cr injection time and @xmath33 is the cr escape time .",
    "the @xmath0 sources we consider should also contribute to the igb .",
    "as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , their generated igb flux is @xmath34(e_pq_{e_p}),\\ ] ] which is related to the inb flux _ model independently _ as @xmath35 given @xmath36 , combing eq .",
    "( 5 ) and the upper limit from the _ fermi _ igb measurement @xmath37 leads to @xmath38{[\\ln(2 e_{\\nu}/{100~{\\rm gev}})]}^{-1}$ ] . using @xmath39 as the measured inb flux at @xmath40  pev  @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath41.\\ ] ] surprisingly , the _ measured _ ( all flavor )",
    "inb flux is comparable to the _ measured _ diffuse igb flux in the sub - tev range , giving us new insights into the origin of the icecube signal ; source spectra of viable @xmath0 scenarios must be quite hard .",
    "numerical results , considering intergalactic electromagnetic cascades  @xcite and the detailed _ fermi _ data  @xcite , are shown in figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "we derive the strong _ upper _ limits of @xmath2 , consistent with eq .",
    "in addition , we first obtain the _ minimum _ contribution to the 100  gev diffuse igb , @xmath42%@xmath4% , assuming @xmath43 . here , the igb flux at @xmath5  gev is comparable to the generated @xmath1-ray flux ( see fig .",
    "3 ) since the cascade enhancement compensates the attenuation by the extragalactic background light , enhancing the usefulness of our results .",
    "also , interestingly , we find that @xmath0 scenarios with @xmath44 explain the `` very - high - energy excess ''  @xcite with no redshift evolution , or the multi - gev diffuse igb with the star - formation history , which may imply a common origin of the inb and igb .",
    "scenarios explaining the _ measured _ inb flux , which is indicated by the shaded area with arrows . with no redshift evolution , the inb ( dashed ) and corresponding igb ( solid ) are shown for @xmath45 ( thick ) and @xmath46 ( thin ) .",
    "the shaded rectangle indicates the icecube data  @xcite . the atmospheric muon neutrino background  @xcite and the diffuse igb data by _",
    "fermi_/lat  @xcite are depicted .",
    "[ fig1 ] , width=288 ]     ( thick ) and @xmath47 ( thin ) with the star - formation history  @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] , width=288 ]     ( thick ) and @xmath47 ( thin ) with the redshift evolution of @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "the generated @xmath1-ray spectra ( dotted ) before electromagnetic cascades are also shown .",
    "[ fig3 ] , width=288 ]    importantly , our results are insensitive to redshift evolution models . in fig .  3",
    ", we consider the different redshift evolution .",
    "but the result is essentially similar to those in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "in figs .  1 - 3 , the maximum redshift is set to @xmath52 , while we have checked that the results are practically unchanged for different @xmath53 .",
    "this is because @xmath26 in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) is similar and cancels out in obtaining eq .  ( 5 ) .",
    "this conclusion largely holds even if neutrinos and @xmath1 rays are produced at very high redshifts .",
    "interestingly , our results are applicable even to _ unaccounted - for _ galactic sources , since the diffuse igb is a residual isotropic component obtained after subtracting known components including diffuse galactic emission .",
    "if we use the preliminary _ fermi _ data , based on the unattenuated @xmath1-ray flux in fig .  3 , only @xmath54 is allowed .",
    "note that such powerful constraints are not obtained for @xmath10 scenarios .",
    "first , @xmath10 reactions are typically efficient only for sufficiently high - energy crs , so the resulting @xmath1 rays can contribute to the igb only via cascades  low - energy pionic @xmath1 rays do not directly contribute and the differential flux is reduced by their broadband spectra , as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "more seriously , in @xmath10 sources like grbs and agn , target photons for @xmath10 reactions often prevent gev - pev @xmath1 rays from leaving the source , so the connection is easily lost  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , synchrotron cooling of cascade @xmath55 may convert the energy into x rays and low - energy @xmath1 rays , for which the diffuse igb is not constraining .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 sources considered here are transparent up to @xmath56  tev energies  @xcite .",
    "we arrive at the following implications for @xmath0 scenarios : ( a ) the spectral index should be hard , @xmath2 , consistent with the present icecube data .",
    "however , future observations in the sub - pev range can reasonably determine @xmath6 in several years  @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 as suggested in  @xcite , the icecube signal will support the @xmath10 origin whether the inb is galactic or extragalactic .",
    "( b ) the minimum contribution to the diffuse igb is @xmath42%@xmath4% .",
    "resolving more sources and understanding the igb can tighten the constraints .",
    "it is widely believed that unresolved blazars account for @xmath58% of the diffuse igb at @xmath59  gev  @xcite , which gives @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61%@xmath62% of the diffuse igb comes from them , @xmath0 scenarios are disfavored .",
    "better modeling of specific @xmath0 sources is also useful .",
    "for example , some predictions of @xmath1 rays from sfgs account for @xmath63% of the diffuse igb with @xmath64  @xcite , where it is difficult for the sfgs to explain the measured inb .",
    "( c ) intrinsic @xmath1-ray spectra of individual sources , if detected , should be hard as well .",
    "when @xmath0 sources like sfgs and igss significantly contribute to the diffuse igb , as required , deeper @xmath65  tev observations by , e.g. , cta will find more known @xmath1-ray sources like sbgs or may detect sources like gcs that have not been firmly established as @xmath1-ray sources .",
    "these also give us crucial clues to more specific scenarios .    in figs .",
    "1 - 3 , broken power - law spectra ( with @xmath66 above the break at @xmath67  pev ) are used .",
    "importantly , our results are valid even without the break / cutoff , since they are essentially determined by @xmath68  pev emission .",
    "viable scenarios must have sufficient cr energy budget and @xmath0 efficiency . using @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is the total budget ) , for a power - law cr spectrum , eq .",
    "( 2 ) becomes @xmath71q_{\\rm cr}/{10}^{45}~{\\rm erg}~{\\rm mpc}^{-3}~{\\rm yr}^{-1})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 ( at @xmath76  pev ) and @xmath77 is the cr spectral index .",
    "here , we show that large scale structures and sfgs can explain the icecube signal  @xcite within uncertainty .",
    "note that @xmath0 scenarios require @xmath2 even if the break / cutoff is absent . on the other hand ,",
    "as independently indicated in  @xcite , the break / cutoff is favored for such hard spectra due to significantly larger effective areas at multi - pev energies  @xcite , so it is interesting to discuss its origin .",
    "agn including radio galaxies are located in large scale structures containing gcs and galaxy groups .",
    "radio galaxies with the jet luminosity of @xmath78  @xcite are promising cr accelerators , leading to the cr budget of @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the density of gcs and @xmath81 is the cr energy fraction . as shown in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , they accelerate protons up to the maximum energy of @xmath82  eev , overcoming various energy losses .",
    "then , crs leaving agn produce @xmath0 neutrinos in large scale structures  @xcite .    in addition , during cosmological structure formation , large scale structures generate powerful igss on mpc scales  @xcite .",
    "strong shocks are expected around the virial radius @xmath83 ( at @xmath22 )  @xcite .",
    "the accretion luminosity is @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath85  @xcite , the cr energy budget is @xmath86 . using the typical shock radius @xmath87 , shock velocity @xmath88 and magnetic field @xmath89  @xcite , we have @xmath90  @xcite that can exceed 100  pev .    while crs are injected by multiple agn and/or igss for @xmath91  a few  gyr , the confined crs produce neutrinos with hard spectra ( even after @xmath92 for an igs ) . for 100  pev protons to be confined in gcs",
    ", the coherence length of @xmath93 is needed . assuming the kolmogorov turbulence with @xmath94  kpc  @xcite , we have the cr diffusion time , @xmath95 , which gives @xmath96 from @xmath97 .",
    "the confinement of crs with @xmath98  pev can lead to hard spectra at @xmath99  pev , while crs with @xmath100 escape into extracluster space , making neutrino spectra steeper at @xmath101 .    using typical intracluster densities @xmath102  @xcite , with a possible enhancement factor @xmath103  @xcite ,",
    "we get @xmath104 .",
    "then , we achieve @xmath105 , which can explain the inb flux  @xcite .",
    "a neutrino break naturally arises from @xmath97 . or",
    ", it may come from a broken power - law cr injection spectrum  @xcite that has been suggested to explain crs above 100  pev  @xcite .",
    "sfgs contain many supernova ( sn ) remnants that are promising cr accelerators .",
    "their cr budget is @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "the star - formation rate is @xmath107 for main - sequence galaxies ( msgs ) and @xmath108 for sbgs  @xcite . at the sedov radius @xmath109 ,",
    "the proton maximum energy is @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the ejecta energy and velocity .",
    "sn shocks or their aggregation can achieve the _ knee _ energy when @xmath113 is high enough  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the galactic cr spectrum is dominated by heavy nuclei above the _ knee _ , so sfgs can not explain the inb at @xmath65  pev unless crs are accelerated to higher energies in other galaxies .",
    "but higher values @xmath114  mg indicated in sbgs  @xcite , potentially give @xmath115  pev .",
    "also , @xmath116  pev is expected for powerful supernovae ( sne ) including hypernovae and trans - relativistic sne  @xcite .",
    "their fraction is typically a few percent of all sne , but we note that they could be more common at higher redshifts and may contribute to the inb .",
    "nearby sbgs like m82 and ngc 253 have a column density of @xmath117 and a scale height of @xmath118  pc  @xcite , while high - redshift starbursts in submillimeter galaxies have @xmath119 and @xmath120  pc  @xcite , implying @xmath121 .",
    "high - redshift msgs have @xmath122 and @xmath123  kpc  @xcite , implying @xmath124 . at low energies ,",
    "crs are confined in the starburst - driven wind ( with its velocity @xmath125 ) and advection governs escape , @xmath126 .",
    "comparing with the pionic loss time @xmath127 gives @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , crs are significantly depleted by meson production during their advection  @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "the diffusive escape becomes important  @xcite .",
    "the confinement of 100  pev protons requires the critical energy of @xmath129 , leading to @xmath130 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient at @xmath131 is @xmath132 , below which @xmath133 ( for @xmath134 ) .",
    "then , we have limits of @xmath135 at 100  pev and @xmath136 for @xmath137 in the kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the diffusion time is @xmath138 , giving @xmath139 ( for @xmath140 ) or @xmath141 ( for @xmath142 ) .",
    "if proton calorimetry largely holds  @xcite , msgs and sbgs may have @xmath143 , sufficient for the inb flux  @xcite .",
    "a break could come from @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "but we may simply expect a pev cutoff due to @xmath146 for @xmath115  pev ( e.g. , by hypernovae ) , where the locally observed crs above @xmath5  pev would have different origins .",
    "a crucial step towards revealing the origin of the icecube signal is the discrimination between @xmath0 and @xmath10 scenarios . for @xmath0 scenarios , combing the new icecube and recent _",
    "fermi _ data leads to strong _ upper _ limits on @xmath6 and _ lower _ limits on the diffuse igb contribution .",
    "the results are largely independent of source models , redshift evolution and the existence of a multi - pev neutrino break / cutoff .",
    "they are the first strong constraints with the _ measured _ neutrino and @xmath1-ray fluxes .",
    "further multimessenger studies in the near future can test the @xmath0 scenarios by ( a ) determining @xmath6 by sub - pev neutrino observations with icecube , ( b ) improving our knowledge of the sub - tev diffuse igb , and ( c ) observing a number of the bright individual sources that should have hard spectra , by tev @xmath1-ray observations especially with cta .",
    "also , icecube may detect nearby gcs via stacking  @xcite , giving another test of the igs scenario , while it seems difficult to see individual sfgs  @xcite .",
    "we considered the origin of a possible break / cutoff , which is favored by the present data since @xmath0 scenarios require @xmath2 .",
    "if it is real , it may provide clues to sources of observed crs .",
    "neutrino sources are not necessarily related to such sources due to the low maximum energy , severe cr depletion and intervening magnetic fields .",
    "but , as suggested in @xcite , some models for observed crs can have soft spectra of escaping crs at @xmath59  pev and hard neutrino spectra below pev .",
    "our results are useful for constructing specific source models . for example , if the inb is explained by hypernovae in sfgs , contributions from normal sne should not violate the igb .",
    "if @xmath0 scenarios are ruled out by ( a)-(c ) in near future , @xmath10 scenarios like grb and agn models will be supported  ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "agn jet models  @xcite have difficulty since target photons in the infrared - to - optical range typically lead to @xmath147  pev neutrinos , whereas agn core models  @xcite might work .",
    "grb inner jet models predict a neutrino break at @xmath148  pev due to the strong meson and muon cooling  @xcite and potentially give contributions of @xmath149  @xcite , but constraints from stacking searches by icecube suggest @xmath150  @xcite so other possibilities , e.g. , low - power grbs  @xcite , may be favored .",
    "multimessenger tests for these sources , though much more model dependent , should be studied .",
