    "the diffractive dis ( ddis ) is a semi - inclusive process @xmath1 , in which proton scatters elastically .",
    "such processes create an important part ( up to about 10 per cent ) of the hera events .",
    "the fundamental description of ddis is based on the leading twist contribution in which the large scale is set by the negative four - momentum transfer @xmath0 from the electron to the proton , carried by the virtual photon .",
    "the proton structure functions @xmath2 are expressed in terms of diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) due to the collins factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "the dependence of dpdfs on the hard scale @xmath0 is governed by the dglap evolution equations .",
    "although the leading twist description of ddis is successful i would like to point out in this presentation , that the dglap fits fail to describe the ddis cross - section hera data below @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , the problem that can be attributed to the negligence of the higher twist contributions .",
    "the @xmath5-integrated ddis cross - section for the process @xmath6 reads : @xmath7\\sigma_r^{d(3)}(\\beta , q^2,\\xi)\\ ] ] where the invariants @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the invariant mass squared in photon - proton scattering , and @xmath13 is the invariant mass of the hadronic state @xmath14 . the reduced - cross - section can be expressed in terms of the diffractive structure functions @xmath15 , whereas the structure functions @xmath16 are related to transversally and longitudinally polarized @xmath17 - proton cross sections @xmath18 .    in the analysis @xcite",
    "the zeus diffractive data were fitted within nlo dglap approximation .",
    "a satisfactory good description was found only for @xmath19 gev@xmath4 .",
    "however , fits rapidly deteriorate with decreasing @xmath20 and @xmath0 reaching 100 percent effect at the minimal @xmath21 gev@xmath4 and @xmath22 . in the recent paper @xcite we confirmed this result (",
    "see fig . 1 , left panel , solid curve ) and found that the relative deviation from the dglap predictions exhibit , power like , @xmath23 dependence , which is characteristic for higher twist effects .",

    "our estimate of the ht contribution is based on the colour dipole model . in this approach",
    "the @xmath25 process is factorized into an amplitude of photon fluctuation into the partonic debris and then scattering of these states off the proton by the multiple gluon exchange .",
    "we take into account the contributions from the fluctuation of the photon into a colour singlet quark - antiquark pair @xmath26 and into @xmath26-gluon triple .",
    "the @xmath5-integrated @xmath25 cross section @xmath27 . assuming an exponential @xmath5-dependence of diffractive cross - section , one finds for the @xmath26 component @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a diffractive slope , @xmath30 and the first sum runs over the three light flavours .",
    "the second sum of ( [ diff_cross_sec_qq ] ) means summation over massless ( anti)quark helicities @xmath31 in the case of longitudinal photons whereas for transverse photons there is an additional average over initial photon polarizations @xmath32 .",
    "the squared photon wave functions can be found , e.g. @xcite and we use the gbw parametrization for the dipole - proton cross section @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath33 component of @xmath17 is calculated at @xmath34 and in the soft gluon approximation ( the longitudinal momentum carried by a gluon is much lower then carried by the @xmath26 pair ) .",
    "this approximation is valid in the crucial region of @xmath35 or @xmath36 , where the deviations from dglap are observed .",
    "the correct @xmath37-dependence is then restored using a method described in @xcite . with these approximations",
    "one obtains : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 denote the relative positions of quark and antiquark @xmath41 , quark and gluon @xmath42 in the transverse plain .",
    "the form of @xmath43 follows from the good - walker picture of the diffractive dissociation of the photon @xcite .",
    "the twist decomposition of ( [ diff_cross_sec_qq ] ) is performed through the taylor expansion in the inverse powers of @xmath44 whereas that of ( [ cross_sec_qqg ] ) using mellin transform technic @xcite . from fig .",
    "1 ( right panel ) , where we compare selected results with data , one can draw the the conclusions that a combination of the dglap fit , twist-4 and twist-6 components of the model gives a good description of the data at low @xmath0 much better then a pure dglap fit extrapolation",
    ". inclusion of the higher twists terms improves the overall fit quality in the low @xmath0 region ( fig . 1 , left panel , dashed curve ) . nevertheless , it is important to stress that a truncation of the twist series ( up to twist-6 ) is require to have a good description of the data .",
    "we also compare our prediction with a recent h1 lrg measurement of dpdfs @xcite which is given in fig .",
    "2 ( left panel ) .",
    "although we keep the parameters obtained in the fit of zeus data the inclusion of ht corrections leads to better description of h1 data in compare to pure extrapolated dglap fits .",
    "the dashed curve ( the lowest ) shows the extrapolated h1 2006 dpdf fit b @xcite and the same fit with twist-4 contribution added ( long - dashed line ) , and with both twist-4 and twist-6 corrections ( solid curve ) from the mss model @xcite .",

    "2 ( right panel ) clearly shows that the ht contributions do not lead to better description of data in compare to a pure dglap fits ( see @xcite ) at low value of @xmath0 .",
