    "fission of charged atomic clusters occurs when repulsive coulomb forces , arising due to the excessive charge , overcome the electronic binding energy of the cluster @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of the cluster fission is in a great deal similar to the nuclear fission phenomena .",
    "experimentally , multiply charged metal clusters can be observed in the mass spectra when their size exceeds the critical size of stability , which depends on the metal species and cluster charge @xcite . for clusters above critical size , simple evaporation of neutral species is the dominant fragmentation channel , while below the critical size , fission into two charged fragments is more probable . at a low temperature",
    "fissioning clusters can be metastable above a certain size , because of the existence of a fission barrier .",
    "initially , theoretical studies of cluster stability were based on pure energetic criteria that only involved the energies of the initial and the final states @xcite .",
    "later , a simple one center liquid drop model ( ldm ) , which was initially suggested by lord rayleigh in 1882 @xcite and later widely used in nuclear physics , was adapted to charged metal clusters @xcite . in this model ,",
    "one introduces the `` fissility parameter '' , @xmath3 , which is proportional to the ratio of the coulomb to surface energy of charged spherical liquid drop @xcite .",
    "the fissility parameter distinguishes the situations when cluster is unstable , metastable , or stable .",
    "the investigation of the rayleigh instabilities in multiply charged sodium clusters has been done in @xcite , where reasonable agreement with experimental data was found .    in spite of the fact that the simple ldm qualitatively describes the fission process it fails to reproduce experimental data in full detail .",
    "this happens because the ldm does not take into account shell effects .",
    "it has been shown that the shell effects are important in nuclear fission @xcite and even more important in fission of metal clusters @xcite .",
    "one can describe the shell effects in metal clusters using the shell correction method ( scm ) , originally developed in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this method was adapted for metal clusters in @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric two - center - oscillator shell model ( atcosm ) , introduced in @xcite for nuclear fission is quite successful in prediction of the fission barriers .",
    "this model was also applied for the description of metal cluster fission @xcite .",
    "although atcosm method uses single electron model potential it has the significant advantage in comparison to other models allowing one simple shape parametrization and an independent variation of deformations in the parent and daughter clusters @xcite .",
    "the microscopic description of energetics and dynamics of metal cluster fission process based on molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations has been performed in @xcite using the local - spin - density - functional method .",
    "this method is , however , strongly restricted by the cluster size , because of computational difficulties , and thus is usually applied to the small metal clusters with the number of atoms @xmath4",
    ".    fission process of metal clusters can be also simulated on the basis of the jellium model , which does not take into account the detailed ionic structure of the cluster core .",
    "jellium model considers the electrons in the usual quantum mechanical way , but approximates the cluster core potential by the potential of the homogeneous positively charged background and , therefore , is better applicable for lager cluster sizes ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) .",
    "most of the electronic structure calculations of the jellium metal clusters have been performed using self - consistent kohn - sham local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "the lda jellium calculations for metal cluster fission can be grouped @xcite into two categories according to the fragment shape parametrization , namely , the two - intersected - spheres jellium @xcite and variable - necking - in parametrization @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the cluster shape parametrization must be flexible enough to account for the majority of effects generated by the shell structure of the parent and daughter clusters , which in general have not spherical but deformed shapes @xcite .    the important feature of the lda method consists in the fact that it takes into account many - electron correlations via the phenomenological exchange - correlation potential ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) .",
    "however , so far , there has not been found the unique potential , universally applicable for different systems and conditions . as a result",
    "there is a `` zoo of potentials '' @xcite valid for special cases .",
    "these potentials , of course , do exist in principle as unique quantities but are not actually understood , so they can not serve as a satisfactory basis for achieving a physical interpretation .",
    "alternatively , one can develop direct _ ab initio _",
    "methods for the description of electronic properties of metal clusters .",
    "it can be achieved by using the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation and by the construction on its basis the systematic many - body theories such as the random phase approximation with exchange @xcite , many - body perturbation theory or the dyson equation method @xcite . based on fundamental physical principles these models can be refined by extending the quality of the approximations , while the physical meaning of the effects included are clearly demonstrated and thus give more accurate characteristics of metal clusters than lda .",
    "originally , the hartree - fock model for the metal cluster electron structure has been worked out in the framework of spherically symmetric jellium approximation in @xcite .",
    "it is valid for the clusters with closed electronic shells that correspond to magic numbers ( 8 , 20 , 34 , 40 , ... ) . on the basis of the hartree - fock approach",
    "the dynamic jellium model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this model treats simultaneously the vibrational modes of the ionic jellium background , the quantized electron motion and the interaction between the electronic and the ionic subsystems .",
    "in particular , the dynamic jellium model allows to describe the widths of electron excitations in metal clusters beyond the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the open - shell two - center jellium hartree - fock approximation valid for metal clusters with arbitrary number of the valence electrons has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the two - center jellium hf method treats the quantized electron motion in the field of the spheroidal ionic jellium background in the spheroidal coordinates .",
    "this method has been generalized and adopted to study of the metal clusters fission process in our recent work @xcite , where barrier for the symmetric fission cannel @xmath2 was calculated .    in the present work we investigate the role of the exchange and correlation effects in metal cluster fission process on the basis of both the hartree - fock and lda methods .",
    "both symmetric and asymmetric fission channels for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 parent clusters are considered .",
    "comparison of results of the two approaches allows us to illustrate the importance of the exchange component of the many - electron interaction in the fission process and make important conclusion about the relative role of the two different channels of the reaction .",
    "the atomic system of units , @xmath7 , has been used throughout the paper , unless other units not - indicated .",
    "according to the main postulate of the jellium model , the electron motion in a metallic cluster takes place in the field of the uniform positive charge distribution of the ionic background . for the parametrization of the ionic background during the fission process we consider the model in which the initial parent cluster having the form of the ellipsoid of revolution ( spheroid ) splits into two independently deformed spheroids of smaller size @xcite",

    "the radii @xmath24 and @xmath25 are functions of the distance @xmath26 between the centers of mass of the two fragments .",
    "they are so determined that the total volume inside the two spheroids equals the volume of the parent cluster @xmath27 .",
    "the ions charge density @xmath28 is kept uniform including the overlapping - spheroids region , @xmath29    here @xmath30 is the ionic charge density inside the cluster and @xmath31 is the total charge of the ionic core .",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath32 of the ionic background can be determined from the solution of the corresponding poisson equation : @xmath33      the hartree - fock equations can be written out explicitly in the form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath34    the first term here represents the kinetic energy of electron @xmath35 , and @xmath36 its attraction to the cluster core .",
    "the hartree - fock potential @xmath37 represents the average coulomb interaction of electron @xmath35 with the other electrons in the cluster , including the non - local exchange interaction , and @xmath38 describes the single electron energy .",
    "according to the density functional theory ( dft ) , the ground state energy is a minimum for the exact density of the functional of the density of the system @xcite . a self - consistent method for calculation of the electronic states of many - electron systems was proposed by kohn and sham @xcite .",
    "this method leads to the kohn - sham lda self consistent equations , which are similar to the hartree equations : @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the hartree potential , which represents the direct coulomb interaction of electron @xmath35 with the other electrons in the cluster , but does not take into account the non - local exchange effects , while @xmath41 is the phenomenological density dependent local exchange - correlation potential . in the present work we use the gunnarsson and lundqvist model @xcite for the lda electron exchange - correlation energy density @xmath42 , which reads as @xmath43    here",

    "we have minimized the total energy of the system over the parent and daughter fragments deformations with the aim to find the fission pathway corresponding to the minimum of the fission barrier .",
    "we have also used the assumption of continuous shape deformation during the fission process .",
    "the deformation of the cluster fragments changes drastically the fission energetics in comparison with what follows from the two - intersected spheres model . in the framework of the two - center deformed jellium hartree - fock approximation ,",
    "the parent cluster @xmath5 becomes unstable towards the asymmetric channel @xmath0 .",
    "the lda simulations with deformation of the daughter fission fragments take into account the decrease of the total energy of the system ( see figure [ fig : bar-10asym]b ) .",
    "in particular , this results in the appearance of the local minimum in the energy curve at @xmath99 a.u . , corresponding to the formation of the super deformed asymmetric prolate shape of the parent @xmath5 cluster before the scission point a. the latter is located at @xmath100 a.u .",
    "the allowance for deformation of the parent cluster and the fission fragments reduces the lda fission barrier up to the value @xmath101 ev , which is in rather poor agreement with the result of atcosm @xmath102 ev .",
    "it is necessary to note that the shape of the cluster fragments in atcosm has been parametrized by two spheroids of revolution connected by a smooth neck @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the oblate shape of @xmath74 fragment is formed at the initial stage of fission process , for separation distances before the scission point . moreover , in the vicinity of the scission point , where the interaction between the two daughter fragments @xmath74 and @xmath76 is strong , the oblate @xmath74 fragment is even more deformed than a free one .",
    "this means that it is more favourable for two fragments to split at shorter distances rather than to be connected by a smooth neck , making the system more prolate .",
    "this fact explains why using of necking type of shape parametrization , leads to the higher barrier as compare to our parametrization .    , but for the asymmetric channel @xmath1 ]",
    "comparison of the asymmetric @xmath1 and symmetric @xmath2 fission channels of the parent @xmath6 cluster is a subject of particular interest , because there have to be a competition between these two channels involving magic cluster ions @xmath76 and @xmath91 . in @xcite",
    "it was noticed that namely in fission of the @xmath6 cluster a magic fragment other than @xmath76 becomes the favoured channel .",
    "figure [ fig : bar-18asym ] shows fission barriers for the asymmetric channel @xmath1 .",
    "we have started from the initial configuration corresponding to oblate shape of the parent @xmath6 cluster with the deformation parameter @xmath104 .",
    "the oblate deformation reduces the total energy of the cluster @xmath6 by @xmath105 ev for the hf and by @xmath106 ev for the lda model in comparison with the spherical case .",
    "we have minimized the total energy of the system over the deformation parameters of the parent and daughter fragments during the fission process for any separation distance @xmath26 .",
    "the evolution of the fragment shapes is shown on top of the figure for both hf and lda models .",
    "the daughter fragment @xmath83 has an oblate shape with deformation parameter @xmath107 , while @xmath76 is spherical , i.e. @xmath108 .    the total energy as a function of the fragment separation distance has a maximum ( marked by vertical arrow a for hf , and a@xmath109 for lda ) , arising due to the alteration of the electronic configuration @xmath78 @xmath110 @xmath79 .",
    "these maxima on the energy curves define the fission barrier hights , being equal to @xmath111 ev for hartree - fock and @xmath112 ev for lda .",

    ", located beyond the scission point @xmath114 a.u .",
    "we have marked the scission point by vertical arrow b , both for hf and lda .",
    "this minimum means that a quasistable state of the supermolecule @xmath115 can be created during the fission process .",
    "however , the appearance of the minimum and thus the stability of the super molecule is rather sensitive to the model chosen for the description of exchange and correlation inter - electron interaction .",
    "this is already clear from the fact that such a minimum does not appear in the hf simulations ( see figure [ fig : bar-18asym ] ) .",
    "the atcosm model calculation gives the value of the fission barrier @xmath116 ev , which is inconsistent with the hf and lda results derived in our model .",
    "such a difference can be explained as a result of variable - necking - in type of the shape parametrization , which has been used in @xcite . in the case of asymmetric @xmath1 channel ,",
    "the parent as well as one of the daughter fragments have an oblate shape , therefore shape parametrization model with prolate - like additional neck is not natural , and results in increasing the fission barrier .    , but for the symmetric channel @xmath2 ]    figure [ fig : bar-18sym ] shows the dependence of total energy @xmath51 on separation distance @xmath26 for the symmetric channel @xmath2 .",
    "the parent cluster changes its shape from oblate to prolate one on the initial stage of the fission process ( @xmath118 a.u . )",
    "this transition is accompanied by the first re - arrangement of the electronic configuration ( marked by vertical arrow a for hf and a@xmath109 for lda ) .",
    "this process has the barrier @xmath119 ev and @xmath120 ev . on the next stage of the reaction the prolate deformation develops resulting in the highly deformed cluster shape , as it is shown on top of figure [ fig : bar-18sym ] . at the distance @xmath121 ( marked by vertical arrow b for hf , and b@xmath109 for lda ) the electronic configuration reaches its final form being the same as in the spherical @xmath91 products . in this case , the variable - necking - in type of fragments shape parametrization used in atcosm does not brake the symmetry of the fragments and therefore the agreement between the two overlapped spheroids hf or lda models and atcosm variable - necking - in approach is much better than in the case of asymmetric fission channel .",
    "indeed , the total fission barrier for the symmetric channel @xmath2 is equal to @xmath119 ev and @xmath120 ev in the two - center jellium hartree - fock and lda models respectively .",
    "these values are in a good agreement with the atcosm result @xmath102 ev @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tab : barrier ] we have summarized the results of the hf and lda barrier heights calculations for the considered fission channels and compared them with the results of atcosm @xcite and md simulations @xcite .    [ tab : barriers ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the height of the fission barrier for @xmath5 cluster in the two - center deformed jellium lda model is @xmath122 ev lower than its value following from the md simulations @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations performed in @xcite also were based on the density - functional theory , but included full ionic structure of the cluster .",
    "since both methods apply the same form of the density functional @xcite , the discrepancy in the fission barrier heights can be attributed to the manifestation of the influence of the cluster ionic structure in the fission process .",
    "one can expect that the influence of the detailed ionic structure has to decrease with the growth cluster size , making the jellium model approach more and more accurate .",
    "however , we also want to notice here that different schemes of md simulations @xcite lead to somewhat different fission barrier heights ( see table [ tab : barriers ] ) .    for the @xmath6 cluster ,",
    "we report a very good agreement of the heights of fission barriers derived in the jellium lda model and md @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that md simulations predict the asymmetric channel @xmath1 to be a little more favourable , however the jellium lda model says in favour of the symmetric path @xmath2 .",
    "although , in both models the difference in the heights of symmetric and asymmetric fission barriers is rather small , being equal to @xmath123 ev .",
    "finally , let us compare the results obtained in the hf and lda models .",
    "the hartree - fock model takes into account the exchange inter - electron interaction the most exactly , but it neglects many - electron correlations , playing quite a significant role in metal cluster energetics .",

    "such a difference between the total energies of the hf and lda jellium clusters is a result of the manifestation of many - electron correlation interaction .",

    "figure [ fig : cor-10sphere ] shows the difference between the lda and hf total cluster energies @xmath126 as a function of fragments separation distance for the fission channel @xmath0 . for illustrative purposes we use here the two overlapping sphere parametrization to dismiss the effect of the clusters fragment shape alteration along the fission pathway , which can be different in the hf or lda schemes of calculation .",
    "it is seen from figure [ fig : cor-10sphere ] that the difference between the lda and hf total energies @xmath126 does not change significantly for separation distances below the scission point , in spite of the strong deformation of the parent cluster . in the narrow region of @xmath26 ,",
    "nearby the scission point the value @xmath126 increases and it becomes constant again above the scission point .",
    "such a behavior is in a great deal similar , at least qualitatively , to the all considered fission channels .",

    "the many - electron correlation interaction between electrons belonging the two different cluster fragments vanishes , which results in the increase of the total energy of the system .    in spite of the fact that many - electron correlations reduce significantly the total energy of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 jellium clusters in comparison with the hf values ,",
    "the difference in heights of the fission barriers obtained in the hf and lda models is only about @xmath127 ev . from the analysis carried out above one",
    "can conclude that many - electron correlations do not influence significantly on the height of the fission barrier if the latter arises well below before the scission point . in the cases",
    "when the barrier is created nearby or above the scission point , accounting for many - electron correlations becomes essential .",
    "for example , many - electron correlations play the crucial role for the @xmath0 fission channel . in this case",
    "the hf model predicts qualitatively wrong barrierless scenario of the fission . in the contrary , the agreement between the hf and lda models is much better for both symmetric and asymmetric fission channels of the @xmath6 cluster .",
    "note also that the hf model , predicts the asymmetric fission channel @xmath1 to be more favourable in comparison with the symmetric one .",
