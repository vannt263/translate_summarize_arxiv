    "in recent years it has become clear that a better understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence in stellar convective zones is important for several reasons .",
    "it is now widely believed that the anisotropy of turbulence plays a key role in governing the transport of angular momentum in the convective zones of stars and therefore in determining their differential rotation ( rdiger , 1989 ) .",
    "more accurate knowledge of the anisotropy could therefore constrain the theories of differential rotation , which at present involve a large number of free parameters . furthermore , it is possible to show ( petrovay , 1990 ) that the intriguing morphological properties of solar and stellar convection found in recent numerical simulations ( stein and nordlund , 1989 , nordlund and dravins , 1990 ) can be predicted on the basis of sufficiently general convection theories if the anisotropy is known . from its influence on differential rotation and on the morphology of convection",
    "it follows that the anisotropy of turbulence is important in understanding the dynamo mechanism ( brandenburg _ et al .  , 1991 , petrovay , 1991 ) . finally , some current theories of stellar convection ( e.   g.   xiong , 1980 ) rely on the assumption that the anisotropy of turbulence remains moderate throughout the convective layer , while other formalisms ( canuto 1989 , 1990 ) include the anisotropy as a free parameter to be specified .",
    "all this suggests that a method to compute the anisotropy of turbulence that is simple enough to be applicable in practice while it still retains the essential physical ingredients of the problem could be very useful in several astrophysical areas . _",
    "it seems to be plausible to treat _ homogeneous anisotropic turbulence as a first step .",
    "despite the fact that homogeneous anisotropic turbulence is `` to some extent a non - problem '' ( leslie 1973 ) , in the sense that any process generating ( anisotropic ) turbulence relies on the presence of an inhomogeneity on the large scales while the turbulence becomes isotropic on the small scales , it has been widely recognized that the study of this subject is of high importance for several reasons .",
    "first , it is expected that with increasing @xmath3 wavenumber the turbulence tends to homogeneity faster than to isotropy ( leslie 1973 ) , so there exists a wavenumber - regime where the model applies .",
    "secondly , in certain flows ( e.  g.   in grid turbulence sufficiently far from the grid ) the homogeneous anisotropic approximation may be valid even on the scale of the energy - containing eddies .",
    "thirdly , and perhaps most importantly , the study of homogeneous and anisotropic turbulence may be an important intermediate step towards the fully general case of inhomogeneous anisotropic turbulence .",
    "_    as efforts to tackle the problem of anisotropic turbulence on the basis of two - point closure models like the dia did not bear much fruit owing to the intimidating complexity of the equations , canuto _ et al .",
    "( 1990 ) propose that , to begin with , simpler heuristic models should be used , followed by the construction of more complex models ( in analogy with the historical development of the theory of homogeneous isotropic turbulence ) .",
    "_    the measure of anisotropy is usually characterised by quantities like @xmath4 or @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are `` characteristic scales '' of the turbulence ( e.   g.   macroscales or correlation lengths ) in different directions , @xmath9 is the turbulent velocity and @xmath10 is a preferred direction ( e.  g.   due to gravity ) . in contemporary practice values of these quantities",
    "are often `` guessed '' on the basis of their values for the most unstable mode in linear stability analysis .",
    "turbulent values for the diffusivities are sometimes used in the analysis as an attempt to take the nonlinear interaction of modes into account .",
    "it is however rather uncertain whether the anisotropy computed in this way represents the anisotropy of the turbulence correctly , not only because nonlinear mode interactions may be expected to distort the shape of the spectrum shifting the maximum , but also because quantities like ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) are defined as _",
    "averages over all wavenumbers , weighted e.  g.   by @xmath11 the velocity covariance spectral function ( or its trace @xmath12 ) , and not as values for the single mode corresponding to the maximum of @xmath13 . the difference is highlighted in figure 1 ( for the sake of clarity in one dimension ) .",
    "depending on how sharply peaked @xmath13 is , the `` typical '' @xmath0 value may be similar to or totally different from the location of the maximum of @xmath13 .",
    "_    in fact , for the case of low prandtl number convective turbulence in numerical experiments the value of the @xmath14 parameter defined in ( 2 ) is found to be very nearly constant at a moderate value of @xmath15 for a range of the @xmath16 parameter covering several orders of magnitude ( chan and sofia , 1989 ) .",
    "( ra is the rayleigh number , @xmath17 the prandtl number , @xmath18 the gravity acceleration , @xmath19 the volume expansion coefficient , @xmath20 the superadiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath21 the thermodiffusion coefficient with @xmath22 the density , @xmath23 the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath24 the temperature and @xmath25 the microscopic ( radiative + conductive ) energy flux .",
    "] , @xmath26 the layer depth , usually identified with the @xmath27 pressure scale height . )",
    "this is in contrast with the anisotropy of the most unstable mode in linear stability analysis which grows indefinitely with increasing @xmath2 ( canuto , 1990 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "canuto ( 1990 ) has shown that if molecular diffusivities are replaced by turbulent ones in the linear analysis , the anisotropy of the most unstable mode , though still quite high and slowly increasing with @xmath2 , will be seriously reduced .",
    "this was the first theoretical result indicating that nonlinear interactions of modes have the potential to limit the anisotropy of turbulence .",
    "the present paper proposes a method to derive the measure of the anisotropy as well as other bulk quantities in a consistent ( though approximate ) way .",
    "section 2 contains the general description of the method .",
    "this model is then applied to the astrophysically relevant case of low prandtl number convective turbulence in section 3 .",
    "the results , summarized in section 4 , agree with the above mentioned numerical simulations .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "the model presented below is a generalization of the giss model developed by canuto , goldman and chasnov ( 1987 , hereafter cgc ) .",
    "the giss model is a single - point closure scheme belonging to the class of `` turbulent viscosity approach '' models ; it has been shown to compare well with experiments and dia results ( see cgc ) .",
    "we suppose that @xmath28 is a `` smooth '' function , i.  e.   that the spectrum of the allowed modes is not discrete . in cases of astrophysical interest ,",
    "for which this model was primarily developed , this is often a reasonable approximation as the studied turbulent regions here form parts of much larger systems ( e.  g.   stars ) and so the eigenmodes populate the @xmath0-space densely enough .",
    "the assumption may also be reasonably valid in some laboratory experiments ( e.  g.   grid turbulence ) .",
    "however , for systems with a discrete and sparsely populated mode spectrum the present approach can not be applied .    in its principal axis frame",
    "the velocity covariance spectral function takes the form @xmath29 for each @xmath30 component we have an @xmath31 source function or growth rate , supposed to be known from the linear stability analysis .",
    "( the dissipation rate is also supposed to be built into @xmath32 . )",
    "so we can form an @xmath33 source tensor function in such a way that in the principal axis frame of @xmath34 the form of @xmath33 is @xmath35 the total energy input per unit time into a given @xmath0 mode is then @xmath36 .",
    "( @xmath37 . )",
    "the basic equation of the model expresses the equality of the energy fed into a given @xmath38 volume of the @xmath0-space with the energy transferred away from that volume : @xmath39 @xmath40 being the complement of @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath41 transfer term is to be determined by the closure . in the turbulent viscosity",
    "approach the r.   h.   s.   of equation ( 6 ) is taken to be the product of the total vorticity of modes in @xmath38 with the turbulent viscosity .    in the case of isotropy equation ( 7 ) for a continuous manifold of spheres centered on the origin of the coordinate frame uniquely determines @xmath34 , once @xmath42 is specified . in the case of anisotropy , however , we need several ( in general three ) such intersecting manifolds of surfaces .",
    "equivalently , one may take a continuous manifold of curves originating from a common @xmath43 starting point and covering the @xmath0-space .",
    "this manifold defines a `` curvilinear polar coordinate frame '' with coordinates @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( @xmath44 is the length along each curve measured from @xmath43 , the @xmath45 and @xmath46 `` angles '' effectively index the curves ) . now in equation ( 7 ) we may choose for @xmath38 a `` curvilinear cone '' with angle @xmath47 centered around the @xmath48 stretch of the @xmath49 curve . taking the @xmath50 limit and using the notation @xmath51 as defined by @xmath52 we get @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total vorticity along the @xmath55 stretch of the curve .    according to the turbulent viscosity concept @xmath56",
    "can be written in the form of an integral of independent contributions . on a purely dimensional basis @xmath57",
    "@xmath58 being a characteristic timescale of the turbulence .",
    "the giss model closure is @xmath59 ( @xmath60 where ko is the kolmogorov constant ) .",
    "equation ( 11 ) shows that in order to solve the system of equations along a given path , the value of @xmath61 must be known along all the other paths .",
    "how can we avoid this awkward recursion ?",
    "suppose that our choice of the integration paths is so fortunate that the behaviour of @xmath62 is very similar ( or even identical ) for all @xmath49 paths .",
    "in the case of this `` fortunate '' choice we will call the paths _ cascade lines .",
    "equation ( 11 ) can now be written as @xmath63 i.  e.   the integration over the angles could be replaced by a @xmath64 factor and the recursion has disappeared .",
    "the method of finding the cascade lines ( i.  e.   such a fortunate choice of paths ) will be discussed in the next subsection . _    now the equations ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) can be transformed into a more convenient form , following the treatment in cgc with slight modifications .    differentiating ( 9 ) with respect to @xmath44 and using the notation",

    "were @xmath72 and @xmath73 known , equations ( 16)(18 ) would determine @xmath74 @xmath75 , and therefore @xmath76 .",
    "on the basis of the original integral form of the equations the initial condition is @xmath77    for @xmath78 and @xmath51 , the asymptotic behaviour in the limits @xmath79 and @xmath80 is known ( for incompressible turbulence ) . in the intermediate regimes",
    "interpolation formulas may be used .",
    "these , and the choice of the cascade lines will be discussed in the next subsection .      in the isotropic case",
    "the cascade lines may obviously be chosen as straight lines starting from the origin ( figure 2a ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath81 is in this case exactly identical for the different cascade lines . in the anisotropic case , however , this choice is not appropriate anymore .",
    "if , for instance , tr@xmath82 has a sharp peak in a certain regime of the @xmath0-space , marked by a dashed outline in figure 2 ( a quite common case in physical processes generating turbulence ) the energy input along paths crossing this regime will greatly exceed the input along other paths , so the @xmath81 values will be very different for different paths at large @xmath44 . on the other hand , one might expect that a choice of the cascade lines that follows the general structure of the @xmath83 function defining the problem ( like the one sketched in figure 2b ) will lead to a much more balanced distribution of the energy input between different paths .",
    "these considerations lead us to specify the cascade lines the following way .",
    "let the lines be the streamlines of a @xmath84 vector field .",
    "as for large @xmath3-s we expect isotropy , and therefore radial cascade lines , we can put rot@xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath84 is now equated to the source function : @xmath87    an equally defensible approach would be to put @xmath88 on the basis that it is the total energy input that determines the shape of @xmath13 .",
    "as however no formula can in general ensure that @xmath81 will be _ exactly identical for every path and equation ( 22 ) would involve much more numerical work ( as using it coupled to the equations ( 16)(18 ) some kind of iterative solution would be necessary for @xmath61 ) , it is more economic to use equation ( 20 ) . nevertheless , alternative choices of the cascade lines can be used to check the dependence of the results on this particular choice .",
    "_    physically we expect that with increasing @xmath3 wavenumber the turbulence becomes more and more isotropic .",
    "this property enables us to find the asymptotic form of @xmath89 and @xmath90 for large @xmath3 values .    for @xmath51",
    "we simply expect @xmath91 as @xmath92 ; while at points in the immediate neighbourhood of @xmath43 we expect @xmath93 for truly 3-dimensional anisotropy and @xmath94 for axially symmetric turbulence ( i.  e.   with only one preferred direction ) . in the intermediate regime",
    "we may simply use an arbitrary interpolation formula describing the `` quenching '' of the anisotropy towards large @xmath3-s : @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 is a numerical factor which must be order of unity as @xmath98 is basically the single important `` length scale '' in @xmath0-space .    in order to be able to find a similar formula for @xmath78 we must restrict ourselves to incompressible flows for which @xmath34 has only two nonzero independent components , say @xmath99 ( cf .",
    "batchelor , 1953 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath78 will take the form @xmath100 and in the @xmath92 limit @xmath101 while in the neighbourhood of @xmath43 where ( in the framework of the present model ) all the energy in the modes comes directly from the energy input by the instability generating the turbulence we have @xmath102 .",
    "our interpolation formula will be @xmath103    the precise functional form of these interpolation formulas is physically not too relevant , the sole important parameter that influences the values of the bulk properties is the @xmath97 quenching parameter .      to summarize what was said above , the recipe to compute @xmath13 for homogeneous anisotropic incompressible turbulence goes as follows .",
    "starting from the @xmath33 source function defining the problem one solves the @xmath104 poisson - equation for the @xmath105 cascade potential ; physically we expect @xmath106 as @xmath92 , so the boundary condition at large @xmath3 values may be chosen as @xmath107 now taking the gradient of @xmath105 one can compute a desired number of cascade lines starting from the @xmath43 maximum site of @xmath105 .",

    "the resulting @xmath13 can then be used to compute the integrals defining the bulk quantities characterising the turbulence , among them the anisotropy parameters such as ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) .",
    "let us derive e.  g.   the expression for the @xmath14 parameter defined in equation ( 2 ) .",

    "an assumption inherent in applying equation ( 6 ) to describe",
    "the flow is that the energy cascade has a preferred direction ; this will lead to a spurious `` hole '' in @xmath13 around @xmath43 where @xmath13 goes to zero ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this `` hole '' is narrow enough for its effect on the bulk quantities not to be serious ; it basically corresponds to the lack of backscatter in the isotropic giss model . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that some cascade lines may actually run towards _ decreasing @xmath3 values ( cf .",
    "figure 2b ) means that the anisotropic model _ does contain some backscatter ",
    "an improvement with respect to the isotropic case ! _ _    the approximation in equation ( 12 ) has the effect that the asymptotically isotropic behaviour of @xmath13 at large @xmath3 values is not strictly guaranteed anymore .",
    "as the bulk properties of the turbulence are mainly determined by the energy - containing eddies at low @xmath3 values , this inconsistency is not expected to cause serious errors in the bulk quantities .",
    "( yet a quenching of the resulting @xmath13 function with the same @xmath97 parameter as in equation ( 22 ) may be used to correct this flaw . )    altogether the method described here seems to be appropriate for a first approximative derivation of the values of the bulk quantities , most notably the anisotropy itself , in a homogeneous , anisotropic , incompressible turbulent flow .",
    "for the numerical implementation of the method we nondimensionalize every quantity by choosing @xmath114 : @xmath115 etc . in order to simplify the notation ,",
    "the tildes will be omitted from here on , but we must remember that all the formulae below refer to the nondimensional quantities .",

    "after computing the resulting cascade lines , the ( 38)(42 ) giss equations were integrated along each cascade line with the euler - cauchy method .",

    "this result is in agreement with numerical experiments but it is in contradiction with earlier theoretical expectations based on linear stability analysis . it remains to be seen how the inhomogeneity ( nonlocality ) of turbulence will influence these results , but it appears that the assumption of near isotropy is not the main factor limiting the validity of present - day convection theories .",
    "_    the computations show that the resulting @xmath163 convective flux is practically insensitive to the value of the @xmath97 quenching parameter , unless @xmath164 .",
    "the physical reason for this is that the flux is predominantly determined by the low wavenumber energy - containing eddies , so details of the quenching at higher wavenumbers do not have serious effects on it .",
