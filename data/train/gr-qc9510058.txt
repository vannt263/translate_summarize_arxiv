    "a realistic cosmic string has structure on a length scale defined by the phase transition at which it is formed . in the case of a gut string",
    "this corresponds to a radius of order @xmath10 cm .",
    "as this radius is so small , one often models the true string space - time by an idealized space - time where the string core has zero thickness and the curvature is represented by a 2-dimensional delta - function .",
    "the idealized model for an infinitely long straight static cosmic string space - time is the manifold @xmath11 with conical metric @xmath12 where the angular range is @xmath13 , corresponding to a deficit angle of @xmath14 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall assume the standard case of positive deficit angle , so that @xmath15 ; for gut strings @xmath16 .    in studying the behaviour of various types of fields and waves far from such a string ,",
    "it is sometimes erroneously taken for granted that one can always ignore the details of the interior structure of the string and approximate the effect of the string by this idealized model with regularity conditions placed at the conical singularity .",
    "this paper presents two calculations involving fields propagating around and interacting with a cosmic string for which this is not true .",
    "these calculations have , instead , the remarkable feature that the quantity calculated , even at very large distances from the string , depends on details of the interaction inside the string core",
    ".    we shall start by treating a ` realistic ' or ` true ' cosmic string having a core of finite thickness with a definite radius @xmath17 ( but assumed for simplicity to be infinitely long , straight and static ) .",
    "this corresponds to a space - time metric taking the standard conical form with given deficit angle outside the radius @xmath17 , but matching onto a smooth model core metric inside this radius ( see eq .",
    "( [ ds2 ] ) below ) .",
    "the first calculation involves a non - minimally coupled _ quantum _",
    "linear scalar field @xmath18 : we shall obtain an approximate formula for the renormalized vacuum expectation value @xmath2 for such a field far from the string and a similar formula for the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 .",
    "the second calculation concerns a _ classical _ electrostatic field at large distances from a _ superconducting _ cosmic string : in this case the string is additionally characterized by a non - vanishing function within the core representing the ` local photon mass term ' responsible for making it superconducting @xcite .",
    "we shall obtain an approximate formula for the self - force on a test charge far from the string due to the presence of such a string .",
    "( as we shall see , this self - force arises as the sum of two terms : a small repulsive term previously calculated by smith @xcite and linet @xcite which depends on the deficit angle and a typically much larger attractive term which depends on the `` scattering length '' of the local photon mass term and is independent of the deficit angle . )",
    "both calculations presented here involve calculating green functions @xmath19 for equations of the schematic form @xmath20 and both involve calculating ( suitably renormalized ) coincident - point values of such green functions . in the calculation of @xmath2 , @xmath21 represents the laplace - beltrami operator for the ( euclideanized ) 4-dimensional string space - time metric , while @xmath22 represents a non - minimal coupling term @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ricci scalar of the same metric . in the calculation of the self - force",
    ", @xmath21 represents the laplace - beltrami operator for the 3-dimensional spatial metric of the string at a fixed time while @xmath22 represents the local photon mass term regarded as a function on that 3-dimensional space . for both calculations presented here",
    ", the sensitivity to the core structure can be traced back to the potential term @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ generic ] ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the calculation of @xmath2 for a _ minimally _ coupled quantum scalar field ( corresponding to @xmath25 ) , one can idealize the true space - time of the cosmic string by the idealized conical space - time ( [ loridealds2 ] ) and , with the imposition of regularity conditions on the scalar field at the conical singularity , obtain an excellent approximation to @xmath2 at large distances from the string ( seesec .",
    "[ expectation ] ) .    that the value of @xmath2 for a _ non - minimally _ coupled field will depend on the details of the metric in the core of the string",
    "even very far from the string was argued by allen and ottewill in @xcite . there",
    "the argument was confirmed by detailed calculations for two model cores : the ` flower pot ' and the ` ball - point pen ' . in particular ,",
    "the value of @xmath2 for the flower pot model was computed numerically and shown to differ significantly from the ideal value out to cosmological scales for gut scale strings .    roughly simultaneously with the work of allen and ottewill , kay and studer @xcite looked at the question of boundary conditions at the conical singularity for a variety of situations involving ( classical and quantum ) scalar fields and waves around an idealized string .",
    "they found that there is typically a one - parameter family of possible boundary conditions for the idealized problem  one of which is regular and the others of which involve a field which , at each time @xmath26 is logarithmically divergent near the origin :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is a quantity with the dimensions of length labelling the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "moreover , they argued that , in the case of many physical quantities involving such a field around a true string , and in particular in the case of eq .",
    "( [ generic ] ) , one should be able to well approximate the effect of the string core by a single parameter with the dimensions of length which they introduced and termed the ` 2-dimensional scattering length ' @xcite .",
    "this length is easily determined in terms of the core metric and @xmath22 by what they termed their ` fitting formula ' ( eq .",
    "( 5.9 ) of @xcite and equation ( [ fitting ] ) here ) .",
    "the approximation proceeds by idealizing the string , but rather than taking regularity conditions at the conical singularity , imposing the boundary condition ( [ kayasymp ] ) where @xmath28 is identified with this scattering length . only in cases",
    "where @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ generic ] ) vanishes , when one can show that the scattering length @xmath28 will be automatically zero , will it be justified to approximate the true string by the idealized string with regular boundary conditions .",
    "non - vanishing @xmath22 will in general give rise to non - vanishing scattering lengths and hence require approximation by idealized strings with non - regular ( i.e. suitably logarithmically diverging ) boundary conditions . in the present paper",
    ", we shall always assume @xmath22 to be non - negative , and , in consequence , it may easily be shown that the corresponding scattering lengths @xmath28 , while non - vanishing , will necessarily be small ( bounded by the string radius @xmath17 in all cases , and , for the problem of @xmath2 , even `` exponentially small '' ) .",
    "nevertheless , and quite surprisingly , we shall find that the failure of @xmath28 to be precisely zero makes a big difference to the effects we calculate , even at cosmologically large scales and it will turn out to be crucially important , if one idealizes the string as having zero thickness , to take the appropriate logarithmically divergent boundary conditions , rather than regular boundary conditions in order to obtain valid approximations .",
    "kay and studer speculated that this method of fitting the idealized boundary condition to the true scattering length may lead to a useful analytical approximation to allen and ottewill s calculations of @xmath2 for a non - minimally coupled scalar field ( see the end of sec .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "they also discussed how this procedure could be used to approximate the scattering theory of electromagnetic fields by superconducting cosmic strings .",
    "furthermore , they also pointed out ( see note 16 of @xcite ) that the self - potential of a test charge due to the presence of a cosmic string ( previously calculated by smith @xcite and linet @xcite who only took into account the effect of a conical geometry ) should have an additional important contribution from the local photon mass term in the case the string were superconducting .",
    "they again suggested that this might be well approximated analytically by replacing the true problem ( i.e. with the photon mass term ) by the problem of finding the electrostatic potential ( i.e. green function ) due to a point test charge in the presence of an idealized cosmic string when the potential is obliged to satisfy the boundary condition ( [ kayasymp ] ) at the string and then taking the appropriate renormalized coincidence limit .",
    "however , it turns out that when one tries to pursue these ideas to obtain approximate analytical formulae for @xmath2 and the self - force one encounters certain difficulties , as was partly anticipated in @xcite .",
    "these difficulties are associated with the fact that the idealized problem with non - zero @xmath28 will have a bound state , which however for small scattering lengths ( less than or around @xmath17 as will be the case here ) is not expected to be ` believable ' ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if one attempts to implement the proposals in @xcite literally , this is reflected in the existence of spurious poles in certain integrals ( see , for example , eq .",
    "( [ correction ] ) in the present paper ) .    in the present paper",
    "we show , by a combination of ideas and techniques derived both from @xcite and @xcite , that such suitable modifications can be made .",
    "we then obtain approximate analytical formulae both for @xmath2 ( eq .",
    "( [ approxphi2 ] ) ) and for the self - force ( eqs .",
    "( [ fsuper ] ) ) which depend on @xmath22 only through its fitted scattering length @xmath28 , and which , in the case of @xmath2 give an excellent approximation to the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "in this way , the basic philosophy of @xcite is vindicated .",
    "remarkably , for small deficit angle we find that the scattering length @xmath28 required to approximate the calculation of @xmath2 is a `` weak field topological invariant '' given by @xmath29 thus , in this case @xmath2 is actually insensitive to the detailed shape of the string core and depends on the interaction with the string core only through the single `` non - minimal coupling '' parameter @xmath5 and the deficit angle .",
    "we remark that , as discussed in @xcite , in the self - force problem , the typical values for the scattering length @xmath28 of the local photon mass term are expected to be of the order of the string radius @xmath17 .",
    "while , at first sight , this is `` very small '' compared to the distances of interest , as we have already anticipated above ( and as , in this case , was already anticipated in @xcite  see `` pitfall 2 '' in note 22 there ) one can argue that such values of @xmath28 will lead to effects at `` medium scales '' which are significantly different from the effects one would calculate in the case @xmath28 were precisely zero .",
    "( the reason for this is essentially because @xmath28 and the scales of interest are expected to occur  because of the `` 2-dimensional '' nature of the problem  in the combination @xmath30 . )",
    "this is borne out in the present paper by our self - force calculation . more spectacularly than this , for the problem of @xmath2 , we shall see that typical @xmath28 values will be _ exponentially _ small compared to @xmath17 , ( @xmath31 for a gut scale string with @xmath32 ) .",
    "yet , we shall continue to find ( and this goes beyond anything envisaged in @xcite ) that the corresponding value of @xmath2 differs significantly from the value one would obtain in the case @xmath28 were precisely zero ( i.e. from what one would obtain in the case of naive regularity conditions ) even on cosmological scales .",
    "thus we conclude , as we have already mentioned , that , for this problem too , even though the scattering lengths @xmath28 are so incredibly tiny , it continues to be important not to replace them by zero !    throughout this paper we shall work with a positive definite metric .",
    "this is a valid and convenient way to treat the quantum field theory since the space - time is static @xcite ( and is irrelevant to the classical self - force calculation ) .",
    "it is however a crucial step in our approach since it leads to computations of green functions that fall off rapidly in all directions from the string . by replacing the lorentzian signature metric with a positive definite one ,",
    "the hyperbolic problem for @xmath19 becomes an elliptic one , with a unique regular solution @xmath19 which falls off in all directions away from the string .",
    "in allen & ottewill@xcite , the quantum field theory of a scalar field was studied on a model string space - time in which the string was still taken to be infinitely long , straight and static but the core of the string was given a non - zero spatial extent characterised by a length scale @xmath17 .",
    "the ( positive definite ) metric was written in the form @xmath33 where the range of the angular coordinate is @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is a smooth monotonic function satisfing the equations @xmath36 the first condition means that there is no conical singularity at @xmath37 .",
    "the second condition means that the curvature is confined within a cylinder of radius @xmath17 , the string core , and that , viewed from outside this core , the space has the standard deficit angle @xmath38 .",
    "the second condition here is actually slightly stronger than that used in ref .",
    "@xcite but agrees with the condition used by kay & studer@xcite and is more convenient for our purposes here .",
    "( note the unfortunate clash of notation that @xmath39 as defined in @xcite is the inverse of the @xmath39 as defined in @xcite .",

    "it seems reasonable , in view of ( [ asymp ] ) and ( [ asymp0 ] ) , to approximate , say , the green function @xmath126 far from the string by dropping all terms other than the @xmath122 term in the sum in ( [ g3 ] ) and substituting for @xmath116 the long - range approximation @xmath127 given by ( [ asympq ] ) .",
    "this leads to the formula @xmath128    as it stands , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) is ill - defined because of the pole in the integrand at @xmath129 . in an attempt to resolve this issue ( and because it is of independent interest ) we now discuss how this approximate green function arises from the point of view of kay and studer . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that the low - energy dynamics for the ( un - euclideanized ) equation @xmath130 on the true string should be well approximated by solving the equation @xmath131 on the idealized string , where @xmath132 is chosen to be the ( @xmath49-translationally invariant ) self - adjoint extension of the laplacian ( defined on the domain of smooth functions compactly supported away from @xmath133 in the hilbert space of square integrable functions ) on the constant @xmath26 spatial sections of the idealized string which gives the best fit to the low energy `` true '' dynamics of equation ( [ uneucltrue ] ) .",
    "before we explain how this best - fit choice is made , we note first that this choice amounts to a choice of self - adjoint extension @xmath134 of the 2-dimensional laplacian @xmath135 ( defined on the domain of smooth functions compactly supported away from the origin in the hilbert space of square integrable functions ) on the 2-dimensional ideal cone of constant @xmath26 and @xmath49 since , in a sense made precise in @xcite , each translationally invariant 3-dimensional self - adjoint extension @xmath132 must arise as @xmath136 for some choice @xmath134 of 2-dimensional self - adjoint extension .",
    "each of these self - adjoint extensions is , in turn , as we have anticipated by our notation , known to be labelled by a single parameter @xmath28 and corresponds to the boundary condition at small @xmath7 on the @xmath122 sector component of @xmath137 ( i.e. on the circular average of @xmath137 ) , @xmath138 where the `` time - dependent constant '' @xmath139 is independent of @xmath49 , while regularity holds in all the sectors with @xmath140 .",
    "so , solving ( [ uneuclr ] ) amounts to solving the equation @xmath141 subject to these boundary conditions .    turning to the question of how the best fit is made ,",
    "we begin by remarking that , at _ zero _ energy , the ( @xmath49-translationally invariant , cylindrically symmetric ) solution to ( [ uneucltrue ] ) will take the exact form @xmath142 outside the support of the potential for some positive real parameter @xmath28 which , it is worth noticing , will be related to the logarithmic derivative of @xmath143 at @xmath78 by @xmath144 or equivalently , @xmath145    the best fit self - adjoint extension is then declared to be the one for which the @xmath28 in ( [ kayasymp2 ] ) coincides with the @xmath28 in ( [ stattrue ] ) : in the language of @xcite , one identifies    the label of the self - adjoint extension in ( [ uneuclr ] ) with the `` scattering length '' of the potential in ( [ uneucltrue ] ) which may be calculated from the `` fitting formula '' ( [ fitting ] ) .",
    "we remark that , mathematically , there is clearly no distinction between the zero energy solution @xmath146 to ( [ uneucltrue ] ) in the region @xmath147 and the zero @xmath99 regular solution @xmath148 to ( [ radialeqn ] ) so that the quantity @xmath28 introduced above in ( [ prefit ] ) is now seen to be identical with kay and studer s scattering length and the equation ( [ prefit ] ) to be mathematically identical with the fitting formula ( [ fitting ] ) .",
    "note that as @xmath123 , one can read off from ( [ prefit ] ) that the scattering length @xmath28 is always bounded by the string size @xmath17 .",
    "( this is the content of `` observation 1 '' in section 5.2 of @xcite . )",
    "the significance of @xmath9 , related to @xmath28 by eq.([qr ] ) , is also explained by kay and studer : @xmath149 is the eigenvalue  with normalizable eigenstate which we call @xmath150 ( @xmath151 , see equation ( 2.6 ) of @xcite )  which exists for ( minus ) the self - adjoint extension of the 2-dimensional laplacian @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "if one thinks of @xmath152 as a possible candidate for a schrdinger operator for quantum mechanics on the cone , then @xmath150 would have a physical interpretation as a `` bound state '' .",
    "as is appropriate for a bound state , this eigenvalue of minus the laplacian is _",
    "negative_. of course , since we are assuming our potentials to be non - negative , the corresponding `` true 2-dimensional laplacians '' for the true smooth string space - times considered here can have _ no _ bound states , so the bound state in the idealized approximation is a mathematical artefact .",

    "the relevant solution for @xmath154 is simply @xmath155 and so @xmath124 . in this case",
    "@xmath9 is set by convention to zero ( see note 4 in @xcite ) , and the corresponding extension @xmath156 ( which is actually the friedrichs extension ) of ( minus ) the 2-dimensional cone laplacian does not possess a bound state .",
    "the circle of ideas may now be completed since one may show ( for example by an elegant method using the krein resolvent formula ",
    "see appendix [ krein ] ) that the _ exact _ green function for the approximate green function equation @xmath157 on the idealized string is identical with the approximate expression ( [ gr ] ) given earlier for the exact 3-dimensional green function outside @xmath78 on the ( constant @xmath26 sections of the ) true string .",
    "moreover , as we mention in appendix [ krein ] , the problem of the pole at @xmath129 in ( [ gr ] ) should be resolved by a principal part prescription .",
    "clearly , there will be a similar formula to ( [ gr ] ) for an idealized 4-dimensional green function @xmath158 for each @xmath28-value : @xmath159 which again should be understood as a principal part integral . as before , one may arrive at this by either of two routes : the first by dropping all but the zero term in the sum in ( [ g ] ) and replacing @xmath160 there by the approximation ( [ asymp ] ) , the second by calculating directly , e.g. by the krein resolvent formula method of appendix [ krein ] , the green function for the ideal operator @xmath161 .",
    "we remark that , in both ( [ gr ] ) and ( [ gr4s ] ) , the integrands have poles at @xmath129 related to the existence of the `` bound state '' in @xmath162 that we mentioned above . in view of this structure , and in contrast with the case of the true 4-dimensional green function @xmath163 of eq .",

    "this is a physically spurious result which has to do with the `` unbelievability '' of the bound state , as is discussed in some detail in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the last paragraph of section 5 there , one possible method of circumventing this problem is proposed which involves `` projecting out '' the `` bound state contribution '' to the exact dynamics for the boundary condition ( [ kayasymp2 ] ) to obtain another dynamics which approximates it on large scales and admits a quantum ground state , but which is `` non - local on small scales '' .",

    "in fact , as is clear from the discussion of sec .  [ approximation ] , the pole at @xmath198 in the integrand of ( [ correction ] ) lies well beyond the range of @xmath199 for which the approximation ( [ asympq ] ) has any validity .",

    "this observation suggests that an equally satisfactory approximation will be given by simply replacing the integral @xmath205 in ( [ correction ] ) by @xmath206 which , by the identity given in appendix [ identity ] is equal to @xmath207 the rationale behind this is as follows : the multiplier @xmath208 in the integrand of ( [ 0term ] ) vanishes at @xmath209 , peaks around @xmath210 of order @xmath211 and decays as @xmath212 for large @xmath210 . on the other hand",
