    "<S> a band of extended states as well as the mobility edges can be observed in all the situations and are shifted toward lower energies by increasing @xmath97 ; and the wavefunction in the metallic regime will spread over the entire system ( see the dashed line of the inset ) . in this regard , the rbls may be used as switching devices and their electronic structure could be controlled by changing @xmath8 and @xmath11 while keeping other parameters fixed . however , the localized state can survive in the metallic regime ( see the solid line of the inset ) , due to the superposition of extended and localized subbands , as can be inferred from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> therefore , we conclude that a band of extended states will appear in the rbls and the systems behave as metals by implementing a relation between @xmath6 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 , @xmath11 , leading to an mit in parameter space . </S>",

    "<S> ( i ) in contrast to the random - dimer model that the extended states vanish when it contains more than two different sites @xcite , our results can still hold when the site energies are randomly selected from a certain probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we consider @xmath60 uniformly distributed within @xmath122 $ ] . by properly choosing the interchain hopping integral that @xmath123=@xmath124 always holds for specific @xmath52 [ eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( iii ) these results also hold for the disordered systems with various layer structures , such as rectangle and hexagon , as long as the @xmath51 s for fixed @xmath52 ( or @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) are constant or follow a periodic distribution by increasing @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) besides the double - stranded dna , we believe our results to be relevant for the becs , which offer an ideal platform for studying anderson localization @xcite ; and the model parameters can be precisely controlled @xcite .    in summary , we suggest a scheme to produce metallic states in a series of disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that a band of extended states could emerge in the thermodynamic limit and the disordered systems behave as metals by properly adjusting the model parameters , generating a metal - insulator transition in parameter space . </S>",
