    "the currently favoured concept of structure formation in our evolving universe , the @xmath0cdm model , is successfully applied on the clustering of matter at intermediate to large scales . however",
    ", cosmological @xmath1-body simulations are lacking good agreement with observations at galactic scales and below . the most promising small - scale modification to this model",
    "can be provided when one allows the dark matter to be warm rather than being cold .",
    "this assumes that dark matter was relativistic at the time of decoupling and hence entails a non - negligible _ free - streaming scale _ , @xmath2 , corresponding to a _ filtering mass _ , @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the power spectrum of structure formation in the cdm model must be corrected for scales below @xmath2 ( @xcite ) to allow for suppression of structures .",
    "our simulation suite was carried out using the publicly available code ` mlapm ` ( @xcite ) , which integrates poisson s equation on an adaptive grid .",
    "we focus on the formation and evolution of galaxy - cluster sized dark - matter halos containing about one million particles .",
    "the mass resolution and force resolution are given by @xmath4m@xmath5 and @xmath6kpc , respectively .",
    "at redshift @xmath7 , an initially homogeneous distribution of @xmath8 particles is placed in a simulation box having a volume of ( @xmath9mpc)@xmath10 . after collapsing the respective closest @xmath11 particles into more massive ones , this lower resolution of @xmath12 particles",
    "is evolved until @xmath13 .",
    "the particles within @xmath14 of identified dark - matter halos are then restored to their former mass resolution . for the surrounding layers of particles",
    "a conservative criterion is chosen , such that the jump in refinement between two adjacent cells is not greater than one (  @xcite ) . the only difference between the two dark - matter models is given by their respective power spectrum . with an adopted warmon mass @xmath15kev , a matter density @xmath16 , and a hubble constant @xmath17",
    ", we obtain a free - streaming scale @xmath18mpc and a corresponding filtering mass @xmath19m@xmath5 ( for details see knebe  @xcite ) .",
    "all structures with masses @xmath20 are suppressed in the wdm model .",
    "for the sake of brevity , the results being presented here are only a selection from knebe  ( @xcite ) and can be read in more detail there .",
    "simulations , which are based upon cdm models , suggest a significant fraction of subhalos on the outskirts of present - day host halos ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "this `` backsplash '' population once resided inside the virial radius of its respective host halo , but is found outside at @xmath13 .",
    "we discovered such a backsplash subset in our wdm model , too (  fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the reduced abundance of backsplashed subhalos reflects their lower central densities with respect to their cdm counterparts , which in turn implies a more likely disruption within a host halo .",
    "it is common to both dark - matter models that the mass loss the subhalos suffer over the entire life time of the underlying host halo is the greater the deeper they penetrate into its potential well . but irrespective of their halo - centric distance , the mass loss of subhalos is enhanced in the wdm model compared to cdm (  fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) , which again confirms the assumption that wdm - generated subhalos are less concentrated than subhalos in the cdm model ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ".      we detected the spatial distribution of subhalos by measuring the angles between their position vectors and the eigenvector corresponding to the major axis of their host halo .",
    "it turned out , that the spatial anisotropy of backsplashed subhalos is more pronounced than for bound subhalos supporting the fact that backsplash halos tend to be on more radial orbits .",
    "infalling subhalos in the wdm cosmology are on average more confined to the major axis of the respective host halo (  fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) and so are very low - mass subhalos ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the bound subhalo population in the wdm model is slightly faster than its counterset in the cdm cosmology (  fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "thus , high - speed encounters like the observed `` bullet cluster '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are more likely explained within the wdm model .",
    "this extremely high - velocity merger between two galaxy clusters is denoted by the vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] at a normalized collision speed @xmath22 .",
    "however , the fastest subhalo was detected in the cdm simulations giving a clue on stronger effect from dynamical friction in the wdm cosmology .",
    "we have investigated and compared the properties of substructures orbiting in galaxy - cluster sized host halos in both a wdm and a cdm cosmology .",
    "both models are able to generate a `` backsplash '' population and a similar anisotropic distribution of subhalos with respect to the major axis of the underlying host halo . on the other hand",
    ", we confirmed the enhanced mass loss via tidal stripping for low - mass subhalos in the wdm model compared to their counterparts in the cdm model , as was shown before ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "infalling subhalos in the wdm model have on average higher velocities than the corresponding subset in the cdm model .",
    "we conclude that the spatial and kinematic properties of subhalos do not allow us to clearly differentiate between both dark - matter cosmologies at @xmath13",
