    "the poynting outflow by the bz process , which is relativistic , clashes with the pre - ejecta . the bz outflow or jet will be more or less beamed and drill through the pre - ejecta , forming a hot plasma cocoon surrounding the jet .",
    "recently , such a situation has been investigated numerically  @xcite , although the jet injection timescale is set to be @xmath192 s , considering jets responsible for prompt emissions of sgrbs .",

    ", the dissipative photospheric emissions from dirty fireballs are too soft and too dim for _ swift _ bat as far as @xmath291 and @xmath268 .",
    "importantly , the typical beaming angle of the observed ees can be estimated to be much smaller as follows .",
    "the ees are being detected predominantly by _",
    "swift _ bat with the image trigger . here",
    "we set the trigger threshold as @xmath292 in 64 s @xcite . in this case , the trigger threshold by bat for a burst with @xmath293 can be calculated as @xmath294 . for an ee with a mean luminosity of @xmath295 ( like sgrb 061006 ) ,",
    "the detection horizon also becomes @xmath296 , corresponding to @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "for an effective total observation time for bat of @xmath299 , and a sky coverage of @xmath300 , the total number of detectable ees becomes @xmath301 .",
    "given that 14 ees have been identified in this interval  @xcite , the fraction of ee bursts @xmath302 and the beaming factor @xmath303 can be constrained as @xmath304 , or @xmath305 which is small compared to the inferred beaming factor of the prompt spikes , @xmath306 @xcite .",
    "we should mention that candidates of  orphan \" ees without prompt spikes , i.e. , long grbs with @xmath307 whose redshifts and host galaxies are not identified , have been detected by _",
    "swift _ bat .",
    "the detection rate of those candidates is roughly comparable to that of sgrbs with ees ] .",
    "given this fact , the constraint on the beaming factor ( eq . [ eq : omega_ee ] ) is a lower limit and can be larger by a factor .",
    "nevertheless , the possible simultaneous detection rate of such ees and gws from ns - ns mergers would be quite small , @xmath308 .",
    "note that the estimated value is independent of the relatively uncertain binary ns merger rate .    in the context of our picture",
    ", a smaller @xmath200 corresponds to a relatively narrow fireball .",
    "we note that the mass ejection associated with the bh - ns merger is orders of magnitude smaller in the polar direction than the angle averaged one , which has been confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite where the bh spin is set to be parallel to the orbital angular momentum . in general , it is expected that they are misaligned due to the kick velocity in the formation process of nss .",
    "although more numerical simulations using general initial conditions are needed to know what happens in bh - ns mergers , the simulations by @xcite suggest that the matter along the bz jet axis is small compared with an ns - ns binary . as a result",
    ", one can expect that a smaller fraction of energy is dissipated in a smaller region of the pre - ejecta compared with the previous ns - ns cases where the outflows via the bz process clash with denser pre - ejecta .",
    "hereafter , we take @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 as a fiducial value .",
    "such fireballs are _ clean _ in that @xmath312 , i.e. , @xmath313 the lorentz factor of such clean fireballs and the comoving temperature at the photospheric radius are @xmath314 and @xmath315 , respectively , and the peak energy of the photospheric emission @xmath316 can be estimated as @xmath317 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_peak_dirty ] ) , the corresponding peak flux is @xmath318 in the case of clean fireballs , the emission duration is @xmath319 .    for a fiducial parameter set ( @xmath320 ) , the emission is characterized by @xmath321 , @xmath322 , and @xmath323 from @xmath324 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ee_obs ] where we also plot an observed flux spectrum of ee associated with sgrb 061006 at @xmath324 ) .",
    "the observed ees can be consistently interpreted as the high energy tail of the photospheric emission from such a clean fireball . to test this scenario ,",
    "simultaneous detections in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath325 ) are crucial .",
    "as for the ees from fireballs , we need to model , e.g. , the subphotospheric dissipation processes in detail to predict the spectra more precisely .",
    "nevertheless , a key message here is that the typical energy of ees is likely to be in soft x - ray bands . in our scenario",
    ", this is essentially due to the relatively large launching radii of the fireball , @xmath326 ( eq . [ eq : r_o ] ) compared with that of the conventional grb fireball , @xmath327 , which results in a lower initial temperature ( eq . [ eq : t_o ] ) .",
    "the importance of soft x - ray bands has been implied from the observed soft photon index of ees and the increase of the fraction of sgrb with ees in softer bands .",
    "we strongly encourage soft x - ray survey facilities like wide - field maxi , which can provide a useful electromagnetic counterpart to gws from compact binary mergers with an angular resolution of @xmath12 .",
    "such ee counterparts are also important in terms of time domain astronomy since they would be observed only @xmath328 after the mergers . if a larger detection rate as eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate_soft_ee ] ) is realized , a statistical technique using a stacking approach might also be possible for the detection of gws , with the aid of soft ee counterparts .    in our scenario , an ee duration of a few @xmath329",
    "is attributed to a relatively small disk viscosity of @xmath145 and the effect of the disk spreading during the accretion . on the other hand",
    ", such a relatively long duration also may be realized if the disk accretion is suspended , but still the rotation energy of the bh is extracted via the interaction between the bh and the disk magnetosphere@xcite .",
    "so far , we have focused on the emission mechanism of ees , and not discussed that of the initial spike . in our picture , the initial spike can be provided by the initial inhomogeneity in the ejecta .",
    "if there is a direction with low column density , either the bz jet , the neutrino - antineutrino pair annihilation jet , or the magnetic tower jet would cause the initial spike .",
    "whatever origin of the initial spike is , our point here is that the major component of sgrbs can be the ees in terms of the energetics .",
    "if a half opening angle of the outflow responsible for the initial spike is @xmath330 , the total energy of the initial spike can be two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the ees .",
    "relatively soft ees without initial spikes might already have been detected by e.g. , swift , but misidentified as other types of events .",
    "one might think that soft ees should have already been detected by maxi ,   though the rapid sky sweeping ( @xmath331 ) makes it difficult to identify the @xmath1 emissions .",
    "our scenario can be more clearly tested by future soft x - ray observations .",
    "we note that the pressure in eq.(29 ) is a factor of five larger than that estimated by the general relativistic calculation by @xcite , which is due to our newtonian treatment .",
    "this causes a factor of five overestimate of the bz power through eq.(44 ) . to take into account this fact as well as the difference between our newtonian dynamics and the general relativistic one , we add a new phenomenological parameter @xmath332 in eq.(44 ) as @xmath333 fig .",
    "5 shows the total energy of a bz jet as a function of @xmath63 for @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath334 , and @xmath39 for three values of @xmath332 .",
    "the total energy is obtained by integrating the bz luminosity over time with a the mass accretion rate that is larger than the ignition rate of neutrino cooling , which is determined by @xcite for @xmath141 ( eq .",
    "42 of their paper ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the rotational energy of a bh with @xmath39 and @xmath141 , respectively . for low @xmath63",
    ", the figure shows that either the effect of back reaction is needed , @xmath332 is small or the disk accretion is suspended for a while as discussed in previous paragraphs in this paper .",
    "therefore it is urgent to undertake more precise analysis for more reliable quantitative predictions .",
    "nevertheless , qualitatively our newtonian model of ees presented in this paper is worthwhile .    in the present paper , we treated the accretion disk in newtonian gravity for a constant accretion rate at first , then required a finite total disk mass and the total angular momentum .",
    "then , we solved the evolution of the size of the disk and the accretion rate .",
    "this treatment should be regarded as a crude approximation , and we should compare our results with the numerical simulations .",
    "unfortunately , we could not find numerical simulations of the evolution of a finite sized accretion disk either in kerr or schwarzschild metric in the literature .",
    "one of the basic problems here is the relativistic treatment of the @xmath63 viscosity .",
    "a simple generalization of the navier stokes equation as the one in the text book , for example , _ fluid mechanics _ ( chapter 127 ) by landau & lifshitz violates the causality @xcite , i.e. , the information propagates with a speed faster than the light velocity .",
    "the reason is simple and clear .",
    "let us consider the non - relativistic one - dimensional diffusion equation for some quantity @xmath335 , @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the diffusion constant .",
    "if we set the delta function source as @xmath338 the solution for @xmath339 is expressed as @xmath340 the above solution clearly shows that the initial disturbance at @xmath341 and @xmath342 propagates to any @xmath100 even for any very small value of @xmath343 , which means the causality is violated , i.e , the information propagates with infinite speed .",
    "the simple rule of changing the non - relativistic equation into a general relativistic one such as changing the derivative to the covariant derivative and using the projection of the tensor with @xmath344 does not help to guarantee the causality .",
    "we need to add several new terms with undetermined parameters to the basic equations such as done by @xcite .",
    "if we can start from the general relativistic boltzmann equation , there is no problem as for the causality in principle .",
    "however , in practice , we should treat the distribution function that depends on three coordinates and three momenta , but it is beyond the ability of the present computer power to simulate such a problem .",
    "one may think that the general relativistic resistive mhd simulations in three dimension are enough to solve this problem since the causality is not violated in such a system .",
    "however , the boltzmann equation should be solved anyway since the gyration radius of the proton is typically comparable to the mean free path of p - n collision at around the isco .",
