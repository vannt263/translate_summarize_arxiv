    "a major thrust of research in classical general relativity in the past decade has been to devise algorithms to solve einstein s equations numerically . despite advances in our analytic understanding of general relativity ,",
    "we still do not know what all the features of the theory really are .",
    "numerical solutions will continue to provide fresh insights into the theory as they have in the past , for example , critical behavior in black hole formation @xcite and the formation of toroidal black holes @xcite .    new urgency has been injected into numerical relativity by the imminent deployment of ligo .",
    "the prime target for ligo is coalescence of binary neutron star and black hole systems .",
    "the waveform is reasonably well predicted by the post - newtonian approximation when the binary components are at large separation .",
    "however , extracting the most important physics requires us to be able to deal with fully non - linear general relativity as the system spirals together and coalesces .",
    "moreover , a number of people believe that there is a significant event rate for the coalescence of massive black hole systems ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . in this case , ligo is most sensitive to waves emitted from the strong field regime .",
    "indeed , without some theoretical guidance as to what to expect from this regime , it is possible we may miss these events entirely @xcite .",
    "however , the goal of developing a general algorithm that can solve einstein s equations for two black holes has remained elusive .",
    "all attempts to date have been plagued by instabilities .",
    "these instabilities are caused by an interplay of three factors : ( 1 ) einstein s equations are an overdetermined system , with the evolution equations subject to constraints .",
    "so if , for example , you choose to solve only the evolution equations , then there can be unstable solutions that are in fact solutions of the evolution equations , but do not satisfy the constraints .",
    "small numerical errors may cause these solutions to appear and swamp the true solution ( `` constraint - violating modes '' ) .",
    "( 2 ) the coordinate freedom inherent in the theory means that it is very easy to impose coordinate conditions that lead to numerical instabilities ( `` gauge modes '' ) .",
    "( 3 ) experience has shown that the kind of boundary conditions we choose and how we implement them can affect the stability of an algorithm enormously .",
    "similar instabilities have hampered efforts to solve the related problem of binary neutron stars ; only very recently @xcite has there been some success in finding stable algorithms . however , black hole evolutions face an additional obstacle that is absent in the case of neutron stars : for neutron stars the gravitational field is everywhere regular , but for black holes one must somehow deal with the physical singularity that lurks inside each hole .",
    "there are two main approaches for handling these singularities .",
    "the first is to use gauge conditions ( e.g. , maximal slicing ) that avoid the singularities altogether .",
    "such conditions , however , lead to large gradients in the gravitational field variables near the horizon .",
    "these grow exponentially in time and ultimately can not be resolved by the numerical evolution , causing the code to crash .",
    "the alternative approach is to excise the region containing the singularity from the computational domain and evolve only the exterior region .",
    "if the excision boundary is placed inside the horizon of the black hole , causality assures us that we do not need to impose a physical boundary condition there .",
    "however , black hole excision is only known to be mathematically well - posed if the evolution equations are hyperbolic with characteristic speeds less than or equal to @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the structure of the equations guarantees that even unphysical modes present in the solution ( gauge modes , constraint - violating modes ) behave causally and can not propagate out of the horizon . for many representations of general relativity such as the usual adm @xcite formulation ,",
    "the evolution equations are of no mathematical type for which well - posedness has been proven , so the suitability of these formulations for black hole excision must be determined empirically on a case - by - case basis .",
    "it is in part for this reason that much attention has been recently focused on hyperbolic representations of einstein s equations .",
    "it is still unclear whether hyperbolic formulations are computationally advantageous .",
    "however , it has been shown that the formulation of the evolution equations can affect stability .",
    "for example , some instabilities can be eliminated by changing from one formulation of einstein s equations to another @xcite or by modifying the evolution equations to change the spectrum of unphysical modes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that many instabilities encountered in practice are due to the numerical implementation of the evolution equations and of the boundary conditions . even for well - understood systems",
    ", it is far from guaranteed that any given numerical approximation to the continuum equations will be stable . the well - known courant instability is a trivial example . hence it is prudent to explore alternative numerical methods that may offer a shorter path to the goal of long - term stability .    traditionally , black hole spacetimes have been evolved using finite - difference ( fd ) methods .",
    "current fd codes for evolving black hole spacetimes with excised horizons are mostly based on a numerical technique known as causal differencing , which allows one to update the fundamental variables in time while avoiding numerical problems associated with superluminal grid speeds .",
    "this technique has been used successfully to propagate an excised hole across a grid , even when grid points fall into or emerge from the horizon @xcite .    however , causal differencing is complicated because it requires interpolation , and it has to deal with points `` missing '' in some irregular fashion near the excision boundary .",
    "the fd operator that performs the interpolation depends on the shape of the excision boundary .",
    "furthermore , even for a given excision boundary and a given target point , the operator is not unique .",
    "hence one must construct a large number of interpolation operators , each of which involves some arbitrary choice , in order to perform interpolations on the entire grid .",
    "it is only by trial and error that one finds operators that result in a stable evolution scheme . for simulations of a single spherical black hole on a cartesian three - dimensional grid ,",
    "we have found a case in which changing a single interpolation operator that is used only for a single target point on the grid makes the difference between a stable and an unstable code .",
    "another limitation of fd methods is the difficulty of imposing boundary conditions at the _ outer _ boundary of the calculation .",
    "there are two aspects to this problem : first , one must formulate a procedure for handling the boundary , such as imposing an analytic condition ( e.g. , a sommerfeld condition ) on the fundamental variables , matching to a wave perturbation described by the zerilli equation @xcite , or matching to a characteristic evolution code that propagates the solution out to null infinity @xcite .",
    "second , one must construct a fd approximation of either the analytic boundary condition or the matching condition .",
    "it can be difficult to find such an approximation that yields a stable evolution .",
    "in this paper we explore an alternative computational strategy : a pseudospectral collocation ( psc ) scheme . in our psc evolution scheme ,",
    "the solutions to a set of hyperbolic differential equations are approximated as series expansions in a set of orthogonal basis functions ( e.g. , chebyshev polynomials ) in space , and these coefficients are integrated forward in time using the method of lines .",
    "psc has three important advantages over fd : ( 1 ) no ad hoc interpolation operators are required to determine field values at an arbitrary point because the solution provided by psc is an analytic function given everywhere on the computational domain .",
    "( 2 ) boundary conditions are imposed directly on the basis functions , with no approximations , in a straightforward manner .",
    "( 3 ) for smooth solutions , psc will converge to the actual solution exponentially as the number of basis functions is increased .",
    "a fd solution , on the other hand , never converges faster than algebraically with the number of grid points .",
    "thus , for a given accuracy , psc requires far less cpu time and memory than fd methods .",
    "psc has been applied successfully to solve problems in many fields , including fluid dynamics , meteorology , seismology , and relativistic astrophysics ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "for example , psc has been applied successfully to model stellar core collapse @xcite and construct equilibrium sequences of irrotational binary neutron stars @xcite",
    ". for black hole spacetimes psc has been applied successfully to solve initial data for the standard field equations @xcite and the conformal field equations @xcite , to find apparent horizons @xcite , to solve the shift vector equation for a kerr black hole @xcite , and to evolve einstein s equations in null quasi - spherical coordinates @xcite .    here",
    "we evolve a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime in one spatial dimension by applying psc methods to a hyperbolic formulation of einstein s equations , the `` einstein - christoffel '' ( ec ) system @xcite .",
    "a hyperbolic formulation provides a well - defined prescription for imposing boundary conditions . at a boundary",
    ", the fundamental fields can be decomposed into characteristic fields , which in the case of the ec system propagate either along the light cone or normal to the spatial foliation .",
    "boundary conditions are imposed on the incoming ( with respect to the computational domain ) characteristic fields , but not on the outgoing fields . after imposing the boundary condition ,",
    "the fundamental fields are reconstituted from the characteristic decomposition . if the excision boundary is placed inside the event horizon of a black hole , then ( for appropriate coordinate systems )",
    "all characteristic fields are outgoing at this boundary , so no boundary conditions are needed there .",
    "thus , black hole excision is a trivial operation . at the outer boundary of the domain ,",
    "boundary conditions corresponding to no incoming radiation can be imposed on the incoming characteristic fields .",
    "we find that our psc method is able to evolve a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime forever .",
    "furthermore , we find that the solution converges exponentially to the exact solution as the number of basis functions is increased .",
    "we discuss the time - stepping algorithms , outer boundary conditions , and gauge conditions required for stable evolution and how these depend on the particular slicing of the schwarzschild geometry we wish to reproduce .",
    "we also show that our psc method can handle dynamics by evolving a black hole spacetime containing a scalar field .",
    "finally , we outline a strategy for applying this method to two black holes in three spatial dimensions using multiple domains , and we present tests of this domain decomposition idea in spherical symmetry .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution - equations ] we list the basic equations we use to evolve a spherically symmetric spacetime , boundary conditions , gauge conditions , initial data , and diagnostics . in sec.[sec : pseud - coll - meth ] we introduce psc and describe our numerical methods . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] we present numerical evolutions of single black hole spacetimes in spherical symmetry . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss our results and the generalization of our methods to multiple dimensions and to binary black hole spacetimes .",
    "we adopt the `` einstein - christoffel '' ( ec ) hyperbolic representation of einstein s equations @xcite . in this formulation",
    "the evolution equations are written in first - order +   + symmetric hyperbolic form , and all characteristic curves are directed either along the light cone or normal to the spatial foliation .",
    "the ec system takes as fundamental quantities the familiar three - metric and extrinsic curvature plus only 18 additional `` connection '' variables ( in three spatial dimensions ) . unlike some hyperbolic representations of general relativity",
    ", the ec system requires no derivatives of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "we write the metric in the usual 3 + 1 form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the three - metric , @xmath4 is the shift vector , and @xmath5 is the lapse function . in the ec formulation",
    "it is not the lapse function @xmath5 that is freely specifiable ; instead , one arbitrarily prescribes the densitized lapse function @xmath6 , defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the determinant of the three - metric .",
    "the use of a densitized lapse does not fix the temporal gauge freedom in any way : one can in principle obtain any lapse function @xmath5 by an appropriate choice of @xmath6 .    to write down the ec evolution equations , first define the new variables @xmath9 m } + g_{k j}g^{l m}\\gamma_{[l i ] m},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the affine connection associated with @xmath3 , and parentheses and brackets denote symmetrization and antisymmetrization , respectively . the quantities @xmath11 will be taken as fundamental variables along with @xmath3 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath12 .",

    "moreover , if the stability restriction on the time limit becomes too severe for practical evolutions , one can implement implicit or semi - implicit time - stepping schemes .",
    "one of the advantages of psc over fd is in how the boundary conditions are applied . in fd ,",

    "finally , we reconstruct the time derivatives of the fundamental variables at @xmath151 and use these values in the time update . failure to impose a boundary condition on an incoming field or imposition of a boundary condition on an outgoing field almost always leads to an unstable evolution .",
    "a dirichlet boundary condition @xmath152 is applied by ensuring that the time derivative of the incoming characteristic field at the boundary collocation point is set to @xmath153 . a boundary condition such as neumann or robin that involves the spatial derivative of the characteristic field",

    "if there is no neighboring domain at a particular boundary , the external boundary condition is applied as described in section  [ sec : appl - bound - cond ] .",
    "in addition to evolving our hyperbolic system of evolution equations  ( [ eq:3dec ] ) , we may need to solve elliptic equations in order to construct initial data for the einstein - klein - gordon system or to enforce elliptic gauge conditions .",
    "consider a linear elliptic equation of the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the solution we are seeking .",
    "this can be cast as a matrix problem where , unlike for fd , the matrix corresponding to the linear operator @xmath160 is full . in 1d",
    "we solve this matrix equation directly , but for higher - dimensional problems , it will be more efficient to use an iterative method .",
    "a nonlinear elliptic equation such as the hamiltonian constraint can be solved either by the methods described in @xcite , or by linearizing the nonlinear system and iterating the linearized equations until a solution is found .",
    "the latter method is employed in the work described here .",
    "the errors in a spectral method are dominated by two types of terms of roughly equal magnitude .",
    "truncation error arises from the neglect of the high - frequency terms that are not retained in the truncated series .",
    "aliasing error occurs because each neglected high - frequency mode is indistinguishable from some retained lower - frequency mode when sampled only at the collocation points ; for example , the functions @xmath161 and @xmath162 take the same values on a grid of @xmath5 points @xmath163 . because of aliasing error , power in the high - frequency mode , instead of being completely neglected , ends up contributing to the lower - frequency mode .",
    "when solving a nonlinear system of equations it becomes important to control the aliasing error .",
    "this can be done by filtering the high - frequency modes of the retained series . for quadratic nonlinearities",
