    "the physics of mott insulators has emerged as a key ingredient in the study of strongly correlated systems@xcite , largely motivated by the understanding that much of the exotic physics of the underdoped cuprate superconductors has connections to the undoped mott insulating state .",
    "the basic model for a mott insulator discussed in connection with the cuprates is the large - u half - filled hubbard model . for this model",
    "the low energy spectrum at half - filling is reasonably well understood , but the higher energy spectrum as well as the physics away from half - filling is still very much an open problem .",
    "much of the difficulty seems to trace back to the fact that the mott insulating ground state for this system is not known .    here",
    "we will study a model of a mott insulator which has a simple non - degenerate ground state and where we can describe the spectrum of excited states and explore the physics at and near the mott transition in a well controlled manner .",
    "the model is a degenerate three channel hubbard model which has multiplet splitting on - site interactions that favor low spin and low orbital angular momentum .",
    "this model is the simplest model with spin and orbital symmetry which at even integer filling allows for a mott insulating non - degenerate ground state.@xcite since the ground state is non - magnetic , the spin physics which complicates the single band hubbard model is absent at low energies .",
    "although interesting in itself as a natural and simplifying extension of the hubbard model , our main motivation for studying this model is that it very naturally captures some of the most distinctive phenomenology of the alkali doped 60 compounds , the fullerides .",
    "crystalline 60 is a band insulator with a completely filled molecular orbital.@xcite doping with alkali atoms , forming a@xmath560 , transfers electrons into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) which according to elementary molecular theory is threefold degenerate .",
    "these form three spin degenerate bands according to the band theory of the crystal .",
    "it is believed that the charge transfer is complete and that the influence of the alkali ions is in general negligible apart from changing the crystal structure and the corresponding band theory .",
    "if these were simple metals , band theory would would predict a metallic state for any doping @xmath6 and possibly superconductivity with transition temperatures which would follow roughly the density of states at the fermi energy as the doping is varied . experimentally",
    ", however , it turns out that the compounds with even integer doping ( @xmath7 ) are non - magnetic insulators@xcite and superconductivity is only seen in a narrow range around half - filling ( @xmath8 ) and with transition temperatures that are sharply maximized here@xcite .",
    "band theory augmented by bcs theory of superconductivity fails to reproduce this behavior .",
    "it is well known that correlation effects are important as these are weakly bound molecular solids with a narrow band width of approximately @xmath9 and it is believed that the on - site coulomb repulsion is approximately @xmath10",
    ". one might therefore expect that the system would be a mott insulator at any integer filling .",
    "this , however , does not explain why systems with even integer filling are generally insulating while systems with odd integer filling are generally metallic . a second related question is why the insulating materials at even integer filling are non - magnetic .",
    "from hund s rule , we would expect the highest spin configuration to be the molecular ground state , s=1 for n=2 and n=4 , and consequently some sort of magnetic ground state is to be expected for the solid .",
    "one explanation for the violation of hund s rule in the insulating materials is that the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect counteracts hund s rule , with the lowest energy jt distorted state of the c@xmath3 molecule at even integer occupation being a spin singlet.@xcite however , a problem with the naive jahn - teller scenario is that static distortions of the 60 molecules have not been detected in solid 60@xcite .",
    "indirect evidence has come from the existence of two energy gap scales in the insulating systems , a smaller spin gap of around @xmath11 and a larger charge gap of the around @xmath12 .",
    "the large charge gap is quite clearly a mott gap related to the intramolecular electron - electron repulsion , whereas the smaller spin gap has been linked to a singlet to triplet gap of jt distorted molecules.@xcite    a different scenario for the violation of hund s rule suggested by chakravarty et al.@xcite and baskaran and tosatti@xcite claims that electronic correlations on a 60 molecule can break the degeneracy of any partially filled molecular orbital in such a way as to minimize the spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "chakravarty and coworkers looked at a hubbard model on single 60 molecule , with strong electron - electron repulsion ( u ) on each carbon atom , using second order perturbation theory in u. the linear in u terms give hund s rule with a preferred highest spin configuration which minimizes the overlap between electrons .",
    "the second order term on the other hand prefers low spin configurations with large overlaps which can take better advantage of virtual excitations of the core electrons.@xcite the validity of the qualitative features of the perturbation theory is supported by exact diagonalization of smaller hubbard clusters.@xcite    one important feature of the scenario based on intramolecular electronic correlations is that in contrast to the static jahn - teller distortions the orbital symmetry of the molecule is preserved .",
    "more recently , it has also been emphasized in a series of papers by tosatti and coworkers@xcite that jahn - teller phonons treated in the anti - adiabatic limit will also give rise to an effective electronic hamiltonian with inverse hund s rule which preserves the orbital symmetry of the molecule .",
    "it may thus be difficult to distinguish the latter scenario from the one based on electronic correlations and a full treatment of both the electron - electron and the electron - lattice interactions to decide which energy scales dominate is asked for .",
    "along these lines a recent density - functional calculation does find that hund s rule is valid for an isolated 60 and only counteracted by the jt effect@xcite , although issues such as electronic screening by the surrounding molecules may also be important.@xcite    regardless of the mechanism behind the inversion of hund s rule on the 60 molecule it is an interesting problem to study the effective model of solid 60 which this naturally gives rise to , namely the three channel hubbard model with `` anti - hund s rule '' interactions .",
    "here we study this model in the limit of strong interactions where we can do standard second order perturbation theory in the intermolecular hopping .",
    "we find that the even / odd integer doping effect , the existence of two energy gaps in the insulating systems , as well as the rapid variation of t@xmath13 with doping away from @xmath8 are all natural consequences of this model .",
    "we will focus primarily on even integer filling ( n=2 or 4 ) where the problem simplifies significantly because of the resultant non - degenerate strong coupling ground state .",
    "based on this we can describe the spectrum consisting in general of an indirect mott gap to particle - hole excitations and chargeless spin and orbital modes with a distinct energy gaps .",
    "we also derive the spectrum of a single particle or hole doped into the non - magnetic mott insulator .",
    "the particle and hole spectra turns out to be exactly the same as the non - interacting band structure up to an overall rescaling of the hopping by a factor @xmath1 or @xmath0 .",
    "these characteristic properties of the non - magnetic mott insulator are in agreement with previous results on the same model.@xcite    apart from the correspondence with the physics of the mott insulating a@xmath1460 and a@xmath1560 our main conclusion is that c@xmath3 with a filling @xmath16 or @xmath17 of the lumo band , with @xmath18 , is best understood as a _ doped mott insulator _ , manifested by a charge carrier concentration given by @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 . in addition",
    "the density of states is up to a rescaling factor the same as that of the non - interacting band structure at the band edges @xmath21 or @xmath22 for particle and hole doping respectively .",
    "if we heuristically extend these results to larger @xmath23 it follows naturally the observed _ variation _ of t@xmath13 with doping for @xmath24 within any weak coupling bcs like scenario as a consequence of the rapid drop in the density of states close to non - interacting band edges .",
    "we will not , however , discuss the actual mechanism of superconductivity , i.e. the source of pairing .",
    "in particular , we will not assume that the intramolecular singlet triplet gap is necessarily large enough to overcome the coulomb repulsion and give rise to a bare attraction along the lines of the earlier work.@xcite in fact , a fit of the parameters of the model to experiment suggests that this is not the case .",
    "nevertheless , any other mechanism , such as one based on attraction from electron - phonons interactions , certainly needs to include the strong electron correlations which are present as indicated most clearly by existence of mott insulating phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we define the model and the strong coupling limit we will primarily consider .",
    "then we derive a perturbative effective hamiltonian valid in the strong coupling limit . in sec . [",
    "sec : mott_insulator ] we study the mott insulator at even integer filling and describe the spectrum of excited states .",
    "we also discuss the distinction between even and odd integer doping and why at odd integer doping the system is more likely to be on the metallic side of the mott transition .",
    "then we use the results derived for the model to get an estimate of the parameters by comparing to experiment on a@xmath1460 and a@xmath1560 . in sec .",
    "[ 2+x ] we study the doped mott insulator at a filling close to even integer and speculate on the implications of these results to the whole doping range @xmath24 as well as the properties at higher temperatures . finally , in sec .",
    "[ summary ] we conclude .",
    "we will be studying a three band hubbard model .",

    "@xmath34 are the number , orbital angular momentum and spin operators respectively .",
    "the lattice is three dimensional and we assume a point group symmetry which is such that the hopping preserves the threefold orbital degeneracy , although this may be relaxed as long as the symmetry breaking crystal field is small compared to the interactions .",
    "we are going to be studying this in the strong coupling limit defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 . for 60 band structure calculations@xcite give @xmath37 and values of @xmath38 of the order @xmath10 have been suggested@xcite .",
    "a subsequent fit of the parameters of the model to experiment on a@xmath560 suggests that the large u limit is quite well satisfied with @xmath39 , while @xmath40 .",
    "the limit @xmath41 is essential for our treatment while relaxing the other limits probably will not change the qualitative features of our results .    at @xmath42 we find that the hamiltonian is simply diagonalized in terms of the states @xmath43 with @xmath20 the number of electrons on a site and @xmath44 the total angular momentum and spin and the energy @xmath45 . in the strong coupling limit",

    "<S> this includes the existence of a smaller spin gap and larger charge gap at even integer filling , the fact that odd integer stoichiometries are generally metallic while even are insulating , as well as the rapid suppression of the density of states and superconducting transition temperatures with doping away from @xmath4 .    </S>"
