    "the global phase diagram of such models includes ferromagnetic , paramagnetic , and glassy phases , and the transitions among these are of second order , belonging to different universality classes .",
    "an important part of the corresponding theoretic and computational studies is based on the edwards - anderson ( ea ) model  @xcite .",
    "the ea model is defined via the hamiltonian @xmath4 where the summation is over nearest - neighbors , @xmath5 are ising spins , and @xmath6 denotes the quenched uncorrelated exchange interaction , obtained in the current work from the following and most popular random bimodal distribution @xmath7    in the present paper , we consider a bimodal spin - glass model with a spatially longitudinal anisotropic bond randomness on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "the random exchange is applied only in the @xmath1 direction , whereas in the @xmath2 - planes , the exchange is taken to be ferromagnetic . thus the disorder is longitudinal and the interactions in the @xmath2 directions are ferromagnetic .",

    "@xcite may be defined by the hamiltonian @xmath8 studied also in the current paper .",
    "exchange interactions are uncorrelated quenched random variables , taking values @xmath9 on the @xmath2 - planes and @xmath10 on the z axis . accordingly , the bimodal distribution of @xmath11 has the general form @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the @xmath1 axis ( @xmath14 ) or the @xmath2 - planes ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 denotes the corresponding exchange interaction strength , and @xmath17 are the probabilities of two neighboring spins ( @xmath18 ) having antiferromagnetic interaction .",

    "we continue with the longitudinal anisotropic model @xmath21 , whereas the previous studies  @xcite concerned the transverse anisotropic model @xmath22 , both with @xmath23 .",
    "the main motivation is the identification of possible effects caused by the introduced anisotropy on the global phase diagrams and the investigation of the universality aspects of these models .",

    "our findings are compared to both the isotropic model and our previously studied transverse anisotropic case  @xcite .",
    "similarities and differences are pointed out and the importance of anisotropy , as well as that of the relevant frustration features of the models , are critically discussed .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows : in the following section we briefly review the monte carlo ( mc ) scheme implemented and some details of our simulations .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] starts with an outline of the finite - size scaling ( fss ) schemes used in the paper ( see section  [ sec:3a ] ) , then presents our numerical data and the estimation of the corresponding critical behavior .",

    "we suggest that , at these symmetry points - @xmath147 - the critical temperatures @xmath130 , @xmath133 , and @xmath129 , are determined by some simple global frustration features of the models .",
    "first , let us assume that the coincidence of @xmath130 and @xmath148 observed in our earlier papers  @xcite is due to the fact that the density of the elementary squares of the lattice , denoted by @xmath149 , which can not simultaneously satisfy all their bonds ( frustrated elementary squares or plaquette ) is equal to @xmath150 for both models .",
    "this is also a plausible explanation of the apparent match in their ground - state energy found in ref .",
    "@xcite(see also fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] ) . for the current model , at the point @xmath115 ,",
    "the corresponding density is @xmath151 , giving a lesser amount of frustration , thus producing a much higher @xmath152 , according to the above hypothesis .",
    "further global frustration features of the models can be invoked in order to support the above argument . as an example , let us consider the class of completely unfrustrated bonds .",
    "these type of bonds ( @xmath153 ) on the simple cubic lattice have zero frustrated plaquette attached to them and one can define the corresponding densities @xmath154 as fractions of the total number of bonds .",
    "then , it is again easily seen that for both the isotropic model at @xmath155 and also for the transverse anisotropic model @xmath156 , @xmath157 , whereas for the longitudinal anisotropic model this fraction is @xmath158/3=1/6=0.166\\cdots$ ] .",
    "thus , the longitudinal anisotropic model carries weaker frustration features , leading to higher critical temperature .",
    "similar arguments can be applied for all five classes of bonds , i.e , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 on the simple cubic lattice or their combinations , strengthening the hypothesis that @xmath152 is mainly determined by simple global frustration features of the models .",

    "error bars denote sample - to - sample fluctuations.,width=8 ]",
    "in this section we present the global phase diagrams of the following spin models : the well - known isotropic ea spin - glass model  @xcite , the transverse anisotropic case @xmath183 presented in our previous work  @xcite , and finally the present longitudinal anisotropic model @xmath191 .",
    "the three models are symmetric around the @xmath192- , @xmath193- , and @xmath112-axis respectively , thus the @xmath194 parts of the diagrams are omitted .",
    "the phase diagrams are illustrated in fig .",

    "the phase diagrams of the isotropic and transverse anisotropic models were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the most striking feature of the coincidence of points and @xmath135 , was supported by the detailed ground - state study of ref .  @xcite . as seen now from fig .",
    "[ fig : phd ] , the present model yields a sg - p point @xmath199 at a significantly higher temperature and the origin of this phenomenon we believe stems from the different frustration features , already discussed in sec .",

    "for @xmath201 , estimates only via the collapse of @xmath82 are given . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the present manuscript , we presented the phase diagram and critical behavior of a further anisotropic case of the @xmath0 three - dimensional ising model on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "the current spatially anisotropic @xmath0 bond randomness was applied only in the @xmath1 direction , whereas in the other two directions , @xmath2 - planes , a ferromagnetic exchange was implemented .",
    "the phase diagram of the model under study was compared to that of the corresponding isotropic one , as well as to the phase diagram of the anisotropic case in which the @xmath0 bond randomness was applied only in the @xmath2 - planes .",
    "the observed differences in the global phase diagrams were critically discussed , assuming that some global frustration features of the models determine the critical temperature , especially at the symmetry points of the models .",
    "as we have shown , the differences in frustration features , at the symmetry point , give rise in the present model to a considerable increase of the transition temperature .",
    "furthermore , our data for the ferromagnetic - spin glass transition line are supporting a forward behavior in contrast to the reentrant behavior of the isotropic model , and this is also proposed as an effect of the frustration features of the model .",
    "our scaling analysis verified , once more , the interesting feature of the irrelevance for the critical behavior of the spatial anisotropy .",
    "this aspect of universality was also found in the renormalization - group study of ref .",
    "the signs of this universality can be directly identified by simply comparing our critical estimates shown in table  [ tab:1 ] to those of the relevant literature .",
    "it is natural to expect that the general universality , observed among these models , is a reflection of the spatially stochastic character of the quenched disorder and the frustration , although the differences in some global characteristics may produce very interesting changes in the corresponding phase diagrams .",
    "it will be useful , as a feature task , to further understand the effects of the global frustration features on both phase diagrams and also on the critical behavior of these simple spin - glass models .",
