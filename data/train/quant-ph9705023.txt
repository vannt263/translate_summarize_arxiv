    "shortly after berry s discovery of the geometric phase @xcite , the idea was generalized in various directions @xcite . here",
    "we follow on the work of wilczek and zee @xcite , who noted that in quantum systems with n - fold degeneracy , the  phase \" is no longer abelian , but an element of @xmath0 , the unitary group in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "these non - abelian phases have been studied in nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) @xcite",
    ".    there have been several demonstrations of the geometric phase @xcite in polarisation optics",
    ". however , _ all _ of these experiments deal with the _ abelian _ phase that berry s work drew wide attention to .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to point out that the _ non - abelian _ phase of wilczek and zee @xcite can also be realised in polarisation optics . since optical systems are much easier to set up than say , nqr experiments , we feel that our observation will aid experimental studies of the non - abelian phase .",
    "there has been some interest in the gauge theoretic aspects of thomas rotation @xcite , which can be abstractly @xcite viewed as an @xmath2 gauge field living on the space of inertial observers .",
    "more concretely , mathur @xcite pointed out that the thomas precession gauge field ( tpgf ) appears as a non - abelian berry phase due to kramer s degeneracy of the dirac electron .",
    "our purpose in this article is to present another concrete realization of the tpgf in polarisation optics .",
    "we believe our work may be of general interest , as it permits a simple optical demonstration of thomas rotation ( tr ) .",
    "while our study is both theoretical and experimental , this paper is devoted to theoretical aspects .",
    "experimental details will be reported elsewhere .    in section 2",
    "we review the gauge theoretic aspects of thomas rotation as a prelude to realising it in optics in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we describe how the phenomenon of tr can be understood in _",
    "purely optical terms _ using the pancharatnam phase .",
    "section 5 is a concluding discussion .",
    "as is well known in the special theory of relativity , _ pure _ boosts ( changes of frame without rotation of the spatial axes ) along different spatial directions do not commute with each other .",
    "in fact , the commutator of two infinitesimal boosts is a rotation and this leads to thomas precession @xcite .",
    "we deal here with the _ finite _ version of this effect , the thomas rotation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be the four - velocity of an observer and @xmath4 and @xmath5 a sequence of pure boosts ( @xmath6 is given explicitly in @xcite ) applied to @xmath7 .",
    "the sequence of pure boosts takes @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and finally back to @xmath7 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "since the final four - velocity @xmath13 is equal to the initial four - velocity @xmath7 , we say that the sequence of boosts _ closes _ ( returns the observer to her original frame ) . in general ,",
    "the product @xmath14 of boosts is not the identity , but @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a rotation matrix representing the thomas rotation .",
    "the rotation matrix @xmath16 can be expressed as a path ordered product or wilson loop : @xmath17 , \\label{wilson}\\ ] ] where the integral is over the geodesic triangle @xmath18 on the unit hyperboloid @xmath19 of four velocities @xmath20 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath21 describing thomas rotation is a @xmath22 antisymmetric matrix , whose components ( in a convenient @xcite global gauge choice over @xmath19 ) are @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "a closed sequence of three boosts must lie in a plane @xcite .",
    "this is no longer true for a closed sequence of @xmath25 ( four or more ) boosts , which involves @xmath25 inertial observers with @xmath25 four - velocities @xmath26 .",
    "however , one can consider these @xmath25 observers in triplets by triangulating the broken geodesic curve @xmath27 and applying the previous argument .",
    "the thomas rotation is then expressed as a wilson loop over @xmath28 . in general @xmath28",
    "is a ( closed , piecewise geodesic ) _ space _ curve in @xmath19 and path ordering in ( [ wilson ] ) becomes necessary , revealing the essentially _ non - abelian _ nature of the gauge field .",
    "one can also consider the limit @xmath29 of an infinite number of infinitesimal boosts .",
    "the integral in ( [ wilson ] ) is then over a continuous closed curve in @xmath19 , which is in general nonplanar .",
    "each boost distorts ( alters the distances between points on ) the celestial sphere of an observer due to the well known phenomenon of aberration of light @xcite from the sky .",
    "when the sequence of boosts closes , the distortions cancel and the net result is an undistorted but rotated celestial sphere , the rotation matrix being given by ( [ wilson ] ) .",
    "in order to realise the tpgf @xmath30 in optics , we draw on an observation by nityananda @xcite regarding the effect of an anisotropic absorber on the polarisation of light .",
    "let @xmath31 be a unit vector representing a general point on the poincar sphere .",
    "suppose that light is passed through an absorber @xmath32 that preferentially absorbs the polarisation state @xmath33 orthogonal to @xmath31 .",
    "if the incident light is in the state @xmath31 or @xmath33 , its polarisation state will not be affected by the material ( although its intensity may diminish ) .",
    "any other polarisation state @xmath34 on the poincar sphere can be resolved in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath33 and , since the @xmath33 component of @xmath34 is preferentially absorbed , will move towards @xmath31 along the great circle @xcite joining @xmath34 to @xmath31 .",
    "the key observation due to nityananda @xcite is that the effect of an absorber @xmath32 on the poincar sphere is identical to the effect of a pure lorentz boost in the direction @xmath31 on the celestial sphere of an observer in special relativity .",
    "the optical element @xmath32 discussed above is purely absorbing ( dichroic ) in the sense that it introduces only a relative attenuation between two orthogonal states and not a relative phase .",
    "dichroic elements @xmath32 distort the poincar sphere .",
    "there are also birefringent elements @xmath35 ( retarders , such as wave plates ) , which introduce a _ pure _ phase difference between two orthogonal states , and rigidly rotate the poincar sphere about an axis @xmath31 . the effect of absorbers and retarders on the poincar sphere is qualitatively different . yet , by exploiting the analogy with special relativity , we see that a sequence of absorptions along different directions can give rise to a net rigid rotation of the poincar sphere .",
    "a sequence of elliptic dichroids can result in a net elliptic birefringence .",
    "_ this is the optical analogue of thomas rotation_.    before developing this analogy in quantitative terms , we briefly clarify our terminology , which some readers may find unfamiliar .",
    "traditionally , optical elements which cause a rotation of the poincar sphere about the x or y axis are called birefringent , whereas those which generate a rotation about the z axis are called optically active .",
    "there is no standard terminology for an element which causes a rotation of the poincar sphere about an arbitrary axis .",
    "since these are merely rotations about different axes , there is no fundamental difference between them .",
    "we adopt a generalised terminology and refer to all of these as elliptically birefringent elements .",
    "special cases of elliptic birefringence are linear ( ordinary birefringence ) , and circular ( optical activity ) .",
    "we also use the word dichroism in the same general sense to refer to elliptic dichroism and not just linear or circular dichroism .    consider an absorbing optical device @xmath32 whose effect on a state @xmath36 is to reduce its amplitude to @xmath37 and whose effect on the state @xmath38 orthogonal to @xmath36 is to reduce its amplitude to @xmath39",
    "( we assume @xmath40 , so state @xmath38 is preferentially absorbed ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the relative and overall absorption coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "since we are not interested in the overall intensity and phase of the light beam ( these are not represented on the poincar sphere ) , we do not need to normalise our state vectors .",
    "a general ( unnormalised ) state @xmath43 can be expanded in the orthonormal basis @xmath44 : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 with @xmath47 the angle between @xmath34 and @xmath31 on the poincar sphere ( the `` colatitude '' ) and @xmath48 the  longitude \" . the effect of @xmath32 on @xmath43 is to transform it to @xmath49 ( where we have discarded an overall factor which does not affect the polarisation state ) . on the poincar sphere",
    "@xmath50 has the same `` longitude '' as @xmath34 and makes an angle @xmath51 with @xmath31 where @xmath52 .",
    "a little algebra shows that @xmath53 .",
    "letting @xmath54 , we notice that this is identical to the aberration formula @xcite .",
    "the relative absorption @xmath55 plays the role of rapidity in the analogue relativistic system and @xmath56 is the velocity in units of the speed of light @xcite .",
    "an absorber @xmath57 with relative absorption @xmath55 corresponds to a boost @xmath58 in the @xmath31 direction with rapidity @xmath55 . by applying successive boosts @xmath58 to the initial four - velocity @xmath59 ( say @xmath60 )",
    ", one can trace the path of the equivalent relativistic system @xcite on @xmath19 .",
    "we now show how thomas rotation can be understood in purely optical terms , using the pancharatnam phase @xcite .",
    "let a light beam pass through a sequence of three absorbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 which closes ( the combination @xmath63 preserves distances between points on the poincar sphere ) .",
    "consider the set of points @xmath64 on the great circle through @xmath65 and @xmath66 . since these points are `` dragged '' _ along",
    "_ @xmath64 by both @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the set @xmath64 is left invariant by both these absorbers . + _ lemma 1 : _ if the sequence @xmath69 closes , @xmath70 must lie on the great circle @xmath64 . + _ proof : _ if @xmath70 is not on @xmath64 , it must lie on one of the hemispheres into which @xmath64 divides the poincar sphere . @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 leave @xmath64 invariant , but the effect of @xmath62 is to drag all points of @xmath64 into the hemisphere containing @xmath70 .",
    "antipodal points of @xmath64 ( which are separated by a distance @xmath71 ) will no longer be antipodal since they are in the same hemisphere .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that the sequence of three absorbers closes .",
    "it follows that the points @xmath72 lie on a great circle .",
    "+ @xmath64 is left invariant by all the three absorptions and therefore by their composition @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath33 be the two points on the poincar sphere which satisfy @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "+ _ lemma 2 : _ @xmath31 and @xmath33 are returned to their original positions by the sequence @xmath63",
    ". + _ proof : _ since @xmath64 is invariant under the action of @xmath75 and @xmath67 , points on the poincar sphere do not cross @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath31 is the only point on its hemisphere which is @xmath76 away from @xmath64 , @xmath31 must be mapped to itself by @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 , which is antipodal to @xmath31 , is also mapped to itself .",
    "+ _ lemma 3 : _ the action of @xmath21 on the poincar sphere is a rotation about the @xmath77 axis . + _ proof : _ under the action of @xmath78 , @xmath31 and @xmath33 are dragged along great circles towards @xmath79 and @xmath70 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "( the closure of this sequence of geodesic arcs is guaranteed by _",
    "lemma 2 _ ) . from pancharatnam",
    "s theorem @xcite , we see that the state @xmath31 picks up a geometric phase @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the solid angle subtended by the geodesic triangle traced by the state @xmath31 as it traverses the geodesic arcs . from fig.1 , note that states @xmath31 and @xmath33 pick up equal and opposite geometric phases @xmath82 .",
    "it follows from the invariance of @xmath64 that @xmath21 introduces no relative attenuation between states @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is the signature of elliptic birefringence in the @xmath31- @xmath33 direction .",
    "the effect of @xmath21 on the poincar sphere is a rotation through an angle @xmath81 about the @xmath77 axis .",
    "it is elementary to verify that @xmath81 is equal to the thomas rotation angle @xcite .",
    "it now follows that the rotation of the poincar sphere due to a closed sequence of @xmath25 absorbers is given by the wilson loop ( [ wilson ] ) over the curve @xmath28 .",
    "a sequence of @xmath25 absorbers can be represented as a piecewise geodesic closed space curve @xmath28 in @xmath19 . by triangulation",
    ", one can reduce the traversal of @xmath28 into a sequence of traversals of triangles .",
    "each triangle causes a rotation about some axis as discussed above in _",
    "lemma 3_. since @xmath28 is not in general planar , the rotations caused by different triangles are about _ different _ axes . as a result",
    ", one has to _ compose _ the sequence of rotations ( and not just add the rotation angles , as one does in the abelian case ) .",
    "the final answer is a path ordered product of individual rotations ( [ wilson ] ) .",
    "a particular case of the optical effect discussed here has been noticed earlier : linear dichroism can lead @xcite to optical activity ( circular birefringence ) .",
    "kitano et al @xcite study lorentz group berry phases , but since they use only _ linear absorbers _ , they only explore an _ abelian _ phase .",
    "as zee @xcite pointed out in the context of the nqr experiment of tycko @xcite , this amounts to exploring a one parameter _",
    "abelian subgroup _ of the full _ non - abelian gauge group_. there is also a difference between our approach and ref.@xcite , which views the linear absorbers as  squeezing \" the polarisation ellipse similar to berry s discussion of the time dependent oscillator @xcite .",
    "the relevant group is then @xmath83 and the abelian phase , a @xmath84 phase .",
    "our approach is based on _ distortions of the poincar sphere_. the relevant group here is @xmath85 , the lorentz group in @xmath86 dimensions , which results in a _ non - abelian _ gauge group @xmath2 .",
    "we have dealt with purely absorbing elements giving rise to a net birefringence . in general optical elements",
    "will have both absorption and birefringence . in the language used in the berry phase literature",
    ", the birefringence is the dynamic  phase \" and has to be  subtracted out \" before one sees the geometric  phase \" . in our exposition",
    "we chose optical elements which are purely absorbing so that the dynamic  phase \" is zero .",
    "this is similar in spirit to recent demonstration of the pancharatnam phase from pure projections @xcite where the dynamic phase is manifestly zero .",
    "indeed , in the limit of infinite relative absorption @xmath87 absorbers become projectors .",
    "it should be borne in mind that this limit is highly singular , corresponding in the relativistic language , to boosting a frame to the speed of light .",
    "there is a mathematical similarity between the effect described here and the pancharatnam effect .",
    "both demonstrate the mathematical phenomenon of anholonomy of which there are numerous instances in physics @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the mathematical structure explored is a connection on a fiber bundle @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the total space , , the base space and @xmath90 a projection from @xmath89 to @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 is called the fiber over @xmath93 .",
    "a connection on a fiber bundle gives a rule for comparing points on neighboring fibers .",
    "in general , the connection is not integrable .",
    "when one parallel transports a point @xmath94 along a closed curve in @xmath91 , one returns to the same fiber , but not in general to the same point on that fiber .",
    "this is a reflection of the curvature of the connection or the nonintegrability of the rule for comparison of points . in the context of the pancharatnam phase ,",
    "the base space @xmath91 is the poincar sphere @xmath95 , the fiber is the phase @xmath84 and the total space @xmath89 is @xmath96 . in the case of present interest ,",
    "the base space is the unit hyperboloid @xmath19 of four - velocities and the fiber is the rotation group @xmath2 and the total space is the lorentz group .",
    "the optical realization of tpgf is a simple analogue experiment which can be easily performed . in the dirac electron realization of tpgf @xcite ,",
    "relativistic effects like tr are small under normal laboratory conditions . in the analogue optical system , attaining ",
    "relativistic \" speeds is quite easy .",
    "one just uses an absorber with a high relative absorption .",
    "one is limited only by one s ability to detect the residual intensity of preferentially absorbed polarisation . in preliminary studies",
    ", we have measured thomas rotation angles of upto @xmath97 in the optics laboratory .",
    "a possible application of the ideas described in this paper is the design of achromatic ( wavelength independent ) birefringent elements . because of the geometric character of the effect , birefringent devices ( optical rotators or wave plates ) constructed from dichroic elements as described above will introduce the same phase difference independent of wavelength , provided of course , the dichroism is not wavelength dependent in the frequency bandwidth of interest .",
    "historically , polarised light has played a significant role in elucidating the field of geometric phases .",
