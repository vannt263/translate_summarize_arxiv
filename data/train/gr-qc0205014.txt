    "it is the purpose of this note to point out , study and apply an idealized construction of gravitational lens equations that is of potential use in many physical situations  from exact lensing to the weak - field thin - lens scenario  by means of an alternative version of the standard usage of fermat s principle .",
    "the fundamental aspect of gravitational lensing theory is the construction of the past light - cone of an observer .",
    "this directly leads to the idea of the mapping from the space of images  the celestial sphere of the observer  to the space of the sources  usually to the `` source plane '' , though this specialization is by no means necessary .",
    "the mapping is carried out by following , backwards in time , the null geodesics of the lightcone , from the observer to the source . in other words , by knowing where an image appears on the observer s celestial sphere and knowing the null geodesics that generate the past null cone , one could in principle follow the rays back to the source .",
    "in addition , it is often of considerable importance to know the transit times between the emission of light and its arrival at the observer .",
    "in fact , in view of fermat s principle , the actual path taken by light is a local extremum of the transit time of all possible neighboring null paths , which leads to the formulation of gravitational lensing via fermat s principle .",
    "much of contemporary lensing theory is based on the construction , on a simple background ( either minkowski or a cosmological spacetime ) , for weak fields and with a thin - lens and small - angle approximation , of an appropriate transit time function .",
    "then , by the local extremization of the time function , a lens equation is constructed . in the usual approach",
    ", the time function ( referred to as a fermat potential ) represents the transit time along all possible null curves , not necessarily geodesic , that connect the source and the observer@xcite .",
    "the extremization produces a suitable lens equation by selecting those curves that are geodesic , i.e. , the variation of the travel time with respect to the paths , restricted to the condition that the paths be null , is equivalent to the geodesic equation with null tangents .",
    "we wish to show that there is an attractive alternative ( and significantly different ) variational principle ( an alternative fermat s principle ) for use in lensing that can be applied , at least in principle ( and , with approximations , also in practice ) , in a generic situation .",
    "the basic framework is to begin with a general four - dimensional lorentzian spacetime where the geometry ( the metric ) of the spacetime is to be considered as the `` gravitational lens '' . in other words ,",
    "the detailed lens properties are to be coded directly into the metric tensor .",
    "we then consider a 2-parameter family of null ( or characteristic ) surfaces passing through an observer s world line at a given time .",
    "in fact , we assume that the family of surfaces is sufficiently generic for the null normals at the observer to be distinct and span the sphere of null directions ( often just an open neighborhood of the sphere is sufficient ) .",
    "this family of null surfaces then contains all the points on the observer s lightcone ( or the open neighborhood ) , since at the intersection of the observer s worldline with each surface the normal vector to the surface is null , geodesic , and lies on the surface . each null geodesic that passes through the observer s world line on each of the null surfaces",
    "can then be followed into the past .",
    "these are the rays that an observer sees and constitute his _ celestial _ sphere ( or an open neighborhood of it ) .",
    "now consider a point source of light moving along some given ( source ) timelike world line .",
    "we are interested in those null geodesics moving back in time from the observer to the source , i.e. , those geodesics that the observer `` sees '' as coming from the source . at _ any given observer moment _ , the observer will `` see '' a number of different light rays ( or images ) , each of which , in general , will have intersected the source ( or equivalently , will have been emitted by the source ) at different source times .",
    "these countably few null geodesics lie on countably few of the null surfaces in the family that we are considering .",
    "thus there are a number of surfaces in the 2-parameter family that intersect the worldline of the source at a point that can be connected to the observer by a null geodesic on the surface . however , at _ any observer moment , _ all ( or almost all ) the other surfaces in the family intersect the source s world line as well , at varying times . in general , however , there are no curves lying on these surfaces connecting the source intersection point to the observer , that are null geodesics .",
    "in fact , most of the curves that can be used to connect the source and the observer on each of these null surfaces are piecewise spacelike and/or null .",
    "for this reason , we prefer to drop any reference to paths , and keep the argument in terms of the null surfaces . the _ source time _",
    "@xmath0 at the intersection point is thus a function on the _ sphere _ of null surfaces intersecting the observer s world - line at a particular observer s time @xmath1 :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 label the null surfaces .",
    "we now ask for the local extremes of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath3 :    [ dt ] @xmath5    this operation picks out those null surfaces that possess curves from the observer traveling backwards to the source _ which are null geodesics_. it constitutes our version of fermat s principle .",
    "this version differs from the usual one not merely in form .",
    "if one thinks of it in terms of paths connecting the source and the observer , this version of fermat s principle allows for curves that are neither null nor geodesic .",
    "it concentrates on and varies the null surfaces rather than the null curves .",
    "for this reason we think of our version of fermat s principle as an alternative to the usual one .",
    "correspondingly , we refer to the function @xmath4 as a _ generalized fermat potential . _ with respect to the underlying meaning of our version of fermat s principle , one can see that eqs .",
    "( [ dt ] ) are equivalent to the construction of the envelope of the null surfaces passing through the observer , which in turn is the past lightcone of the observer",
    ". thus we arrive at the observer s lightcone starting from surfaces in a way analogous to the usual approach , which arrives at the observer s lightcone starting from null paths .    in section",
    "ii we describe this construction in greater detail and justify the claim that it does pick out the null surfaces so that null geodesics connect the observer with the source thus yielding the past lightcone . in sec .",
    "iii we illustrate the construction for the trivial case of minkowski space without a lens , while in sec .",
    "iv we illustrate it for a minkowski space background with a static thin lens , the conventional scenario . in sec .",
    "v we apply the construction to thin lenses that are moving in order to obtain the corrections to the lens equation due to the motion of the lens . in section  vi these ideas are applied to the frw cosmologies using the fact that they all are conformally related to minkowski space .",
    "we conclude , in section  vii , with remarks and an outlook of the potential applications of the construction .",
    "we find this method quite enlightening concerning the underlying ideas in gravitational lensing theory .",
    "and although it might be difficult to apply in many practical physical situations without the use of heavy approximations , preliminary calculations suggest that , with further development , it could well be of practical use .",
    "we assume that we have a four - dimensional lorentzian manifold , @xmath6 with a given lorentzian metric , @xmath7 .",
    "we further assume that null geodesics and null surfaces ( solutions to the eikonal equation ) can be constructed , in some local coordinates , wherever needed .",
    "in general , null surfaces develop wavefront singularities and , in principle , one must worry about them .",
    "however , the trouble caused by the singularities is easily bypassed if the surfaces are parametrized by the null geodesics that rule them .",
    "the fundamental objects for us will be _ complete integrals of the eikonal equation : _ two - parameter families of foliations of the spacetime by null surfaces , so that at any spacetime point there is a sphere s worth of null surfaces through that point .",
    "the two parameters are arbitrary , but for our purposes we specify them as points on the sphere . in the following , then , we adopt this particular choice of parameters to label the solutions of the eikonal equation in the complete integral , and we specify them by complex stereographic coordinates @xmath8 , rather than the regular spherical coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "the complete integral is given analytically by an expression of the form    @xmath9    such that for each fixed value of @xmath8 the level surfaces of ( [ z ] ) are null .",
    "equivalently , ( [ z ] ) satisfies the eikonal equation    @xmath10    with two further conditions : the four functions @xmath11 form a rank - four set with respect to @xmath12 _ almost everywhere _ , whereas _ globally _ , the three functions @xmath13 form a rank - three set .",
    "how these conditions are used is explained shortly below .",
    "in addition , the null covectors @xmath14 at fixed @xmath12 sweep out all null directions as @xmath8 vary , thus reproducing the local lightcone .",
    "we rewrite ( [ z ] ) as the two - point function    @xmath15    any two points @xmath16 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ gted ] ) for fixed @xmath8 lie on the same null surface .",
    "it is clear that the gradient of @xmath17 with respect to either point is a null covector .",
    "if @xmath18 is fixed , however , then the points @xmath12 that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ gted ] ) for each @xmath8 lie on different null surfaces , but @xmath18 belongs to all .",
    "so we think of @xmath18 as a special point where all the null surfaces intersect .    the point @xmath18 is chosen to lie on the observer s worldline given by @xmath19 , @xmath1 being some observer time . though it is not needed and is used only for convenience , we choose , in the neighborhood of the source , a special coordinate system where the source remains at a fixed spatial point , @xmath20 , and only the source time @xmath21 evolves .",
    "the equation @xmath22 then becomes    @xmath23    or , rewritten ( since @xmath24 by assumption ) as    @xmath25    it gives rise to our time function , eq .",
    "( [ ts ] ) . as a matter of notation , by analogy with the usual theory of gravitational lensing",
    "it is natural for us to refer to @xmath4 as a _ generalized fermat potential .",
    "_ however , the function @xmath17 arises more naturally from the starting point of the eikonal equation , therefore , with a slight abuse of terminology , we refer to it as the _ implicit fermat potential , _ and for all practical purposes we use eq .",
    "( [ g1ted ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ ghat ] ) .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath4 are calculated in terms of the implicit fermat potential @xmath17 by implicit differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ g1ted ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath26 and @xmath27 are obtained from    [ minimal ] @xmath28    so that the vanishing of @xmath26 and @xmath27 implies the vanishing of both @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the reverse , i.e. ,    @xmath31    thus , setting @xmath32 gives us the extreme values of @xmath4 .",
    "there is a deeper meaning to the extremization of @xmath4 , in connection with the null surfaces in the family , as we subsequently show .",
    "returning to eq.([gted ] ) , with fixed @xmath18 , we see that we have a two - parameter family of surfaces through a fixed point @xmath18 .",
    "a new surface , with common tangent curves all passing through @xmath18 , is the envelope of the family and is constructed by requiring that @xmath33 .",
    "the triple    [ triple ] @xmath34    defines the envelope . for @xmath35 and in a region",
    "_ without _ wavefront singularities@xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ triple2 ] ) and ( [ triple3 ] ) can be algebraically inverted so that    [ gamma ] @xmath36    when they are substituted into ( [ triple ] ) , we have the equation for a three - surface , namely the envelope :    @xmath37    that @xmath38 is a null surface follows from both the fact that @xmath39 is a null vector ( by assumption ) and from ( [ triple2])-([triple3 ] ) . that it is the null cone of the point @xmath18",
    "is shown by demonstrating that at @xmath40 the surface has a sphere s worth of tangents .",
    "this is seen by the following argument : in the limit as @xmath41 , eqs .",
    "( [ triple2])-([triple3 ] ) are identically satisfied for all values of @xmath42 .",
    "this is a degenerate point where eqs.([gamma ] ) _ do not _ hold .",
    "it then follows that the tangent vector , given by    @xmath43    has multiple values , yielding a null vector that sweeps out the tangent - space null cone at @xmath18 , as @xmath8 moves over the sphere .",
    "our task is now to show that this extremization process picks out the particular surfaces that connect the source and observer by null geodesics ; namely , the values of @xmath8 for each pair @xmath16 given explicitly by ( [ gamma ] )  or implicitly by ( [ triple2])-([triple3 ] )  label a geodesic null vector whose integral line passes through @xmath18 and @xmath12 . in order to show this",
    ", we notice that when eqs .",
    "( [ triple2])-([triple3 ] ) can not be inverted , i.e. , when the jacobian    @xmath44    vanishes , the null surfaces develop wavefront singularities@xcite .",
    "but by the assumption that @xmath45 is a complete integral and the rank conditions , in either case the three equations ( [ triple ] ) can be solved for three ( say @xmath20 ) of the four spacetime coordinates @xmath12 , in terms of a fourth one ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath8 , namely :    @xmath47    as a consequence of ( [ triple ] ) , it turns out that the curves described by ( [ parametric ] ) by keeping @xmath8 fixed are null geodesics .",
    "this can be seen by implicit differentiation of ( [ triple ] ) with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "defining @xmath48 , we obtain    [ triple * ] @xmath49    where ( @xmath50 are independent , by the rank condition , again .",
    "( [ triple*1 ] ) implies that @xmath51 has no component pointing out of the surface , so @xmath52 . using this in eqs .",
    "( [ triple*2 ] ) and ( [ triple*3 ] ) implies that @xmath53 and hence @xmath54 , and thusthe tangent vector is proportional to @xmath55 being therefore null , and the integral curves are null geodesics .",
    "we thus obtain the parametric description of all the null geodesics through @xmath18 . notice that having this parametric description of the lightcone ( in terms of the observer s celestial sphere ) is entirely equivalent to having a lens equation relating the angular position of the source at a given distance to the angular position of the image on the celestial sphere , plus a time of arrival equation yielding the transit time of the light signal from the source to the observer@xcite . to see this , the point @xmath18 is taken to represent a point on the observer s worldline . by treating @xmath8 as the celestial sphere of the observer , @xmath46 as a measure of `` distance '' backwards along the null geodesic to a source and @xmath20 as representing the `` time '' and `` angular position '' of the source at the moment of emission",
    ", we have constructed a lens equation together with the transit time equation .",
    "thus one can see that , in a completely general context , our version of fermat s principle , eqs .",
    "( [ dt ] ) , leads immediately to the construction of the observer s past lightcone , with associated lens and time of arrival equations .",
    "when we extremize the function @xmath4 we could obtain a maximum , a minimum or a saddle point .",
    "we wish to know how to rephrase the conditions for maximum , minimum or saddle in terms of our implicit fermat potential , g. in principle , we need to look at the eigenvalues of the matrix containing the second derivatives of @xmath4 evaluated at the extrema .",
    "we now switch to real variables @xmath56 instead of @xmath8 , via @xmath57 , and calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix    @xmath58    because of @xmath4 being implicitly defined via ( [ g1ted ] ) , we just need to take second derivatives of ( [ g1ted ] ) . for instance , if we take two @xmath59derivatives of ( [ g1ted ] ) ( with ( [ ghat ] ) for @xmath0 ) we obtain    @xmath60    since we are interested only in the value of @xmath61 at the extremum , then @xmath62 and    @xmath63    which presents no difficulty , since by assumption @xmath64 must be nonvanishing .",
    "likewise , the other components of the matrix come out proportional to the second derivatives of @xmath17 :    @xmath65    thus , up to a factor of @xmath66 the eigenvalues are the same as those of @xmath67 .",
    "in order to fix unnecessary sign freedom ( since @xmath68 for our purposes is just as good as @xmath17 ) , we assume that @xmath69 at the extremum in question . it remains to rephrase our conditions for maximum , minimum and saddle in terms of the complex variable @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 , thus    [ eq:20 s ] @xmath74    if we think of @xmath17 as spin - weight zero function on the sphere then , using the envelope condition , @xmath75 we have    [ eq:23 s ] @xmath76    and hence    @xmath77    the eigenvalue equation for @xmath78 is given by    @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is an eigenvalue of @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath64 is assumed to be negative , then the sign of @xmath81 is the same as the sign of @xmath82 .",
    "the solutions are    @xmath83    finally , the conditions are :    * if @xmath84 , the extremum is a saddle , since the eigenvalues have opposite signs . * if @xmath85 , the extremum is a minimum , since both eigenvalues are positive . *",
    "if @xmath86 , the extremum is a maximum , since both eigenvalues are negative .",
    "on the other hand , the envelope develops singularities when    @xmath87    as anticipated earlier ( the vanishing of the determinant of the jacobian matrix ) .",
    "the type of extremum is of fundamental importance .",
    "for instance , in a very weak field , no singularities develop in the observer s lightcone , there is no multiplicity of images and the lens equation represents a local minimum of the fermat potential .",
    "increasing the strength of the field , in a situation where there are three images , one will be a minimum , one a maximum and the remaining one will be a saddle .",
    "the minimum corresponds to the primary image , produced by a ray that does not encounter a caustic in its path .",
    "the saddle corresponds to a ray that passes the caustic once .",
    "the maximum yields the ray that passes the caustic twice and yields the faintest image .",
    "the generalization of this interpretation to cases of more than three images is complicated@xcite and lies beyond our present interest .",
    "we finish this section by presenting a very important method for describing implicit fermat potentials . in many cases",
    "it is difficult or impossible ( as we will see ) to obtain a closed - form @xmath17 for a family of surfaces @xmath22 , especially if the surfaces self - intersect and have singularities . in such cases ,",
    "it is simpler to describe the family of surfaces in parametric form adapted to the null geodesics ruling the surface , namely , by specifying the map    @xmath88    where @xmath89 are coordinates on the surface , given for each fixed value of @xmath8 .",
    "since each member of the family ( for fixed @xmath8 ) is a null surface , it is automatically ruled by null geodesics ( except at singular points of the surface )",
    ". therefore the surface coordinates @xmath90 can always be chosen as geodesic coordinates : @xmath91 labeling the null geodesics ruling the surface , and @xmath92 as an affine parameter along the geodesics . however , our interest is in surfaces that intersect at a given point @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , all the surfaces in the family must contain the common point @xmath18 .",
    "we can make use of this fact by adapting the coordinates @xmath93 to this point . since @xmath92 is a parameter along the geodesics ,",
    "we fix it by demanding that the 2-surface @xmath94 be transverse ( to the null geodesics in the null surface ) and contain the point @xmath18 .",
    "this is , then , the initial - data surface for the geodesics in the null surface . on this initial - data 2-surface , the origin of coordinates for @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be taken to be @xmath18 . in this manner , all the null surfaces in the family will single out the observer s point as the point with @xmath97 , namely :    @xmath98    so that @xmath99 depends on @xmath18 , i.e. ,    @xmath100    often we take @xmath18 as the observation time @xmath1 at the spatial origin and omit it from the equations .    in the case that the family of surfaces @xmath22 is given parametrically via ( [ parametricg ] ) , the envelope construction proceeds in an implicit manner as follows . in the first place , the ruling of the null surface via null geodesics guarantees that the jacobian matrix of the map ( [ parametricg ] ) , namely @xmath101 , has rank three ( except at singular points ) .",
    "therefore , locally , from the equations ( [ parametricg ] ) one can always chose 3 equations that can be solved for @xmath102 .",
    "the fourth equation remains a function of @xmath102 .",
    "so equations ( [ parametricg ] ) can always be viewed in the form    [ implicitgs ] @xmath103    where ( [ implicitg ] ) is interpreted as the equation @xmath22 if @xmath102 is thought of as implicitly given in terms of @xmath20 via ( [ implicits ] ) . in other words ,",
    "@xmath104    in the envelope construction we then have    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is determined by implicit differentiation of ( [ implicits ] ) . both eqs.([gimplicit ] ) and ( [ dgimplicit ] ) will be extensively used in the following sections .",
    "this appears to be a convenient method for constructing implicit fermat potentials and for obtaining lens equations , as demonstrated in the following sections .",
    "the case of minkowski spacetime is quite trivial but is helpful as an illustration of the main ideas underlying the concept of the implicit fermat potential @xmath17 . in cartesian",
    "coordinates @xmath12 , null surfaces in minkowski spacetime are level surfaces of the solutions to the eikonal equation @xmath107 , with @xmath108diag@xmath109 .",
    "there is a 2-parameter family of distinct foliations by null planes with the two parameters corresponding to a sphere s worth of null directions at any given spacetime point . using complex stereographic coordinates ,",
    "the null directions can be specified by @xmath110 given by    @xmath111    the null planes with null normal @xmath112 containing the observer s location @xmath113 are given by    @xmath114    the envelope of this 2-parameter family of null planes is the lightcone of the point @xmath18 and is obtained by taking the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath70 and @xmath115 of the function @xmath116 and setting these derivatives equal to zero . in this case :    [ gderiv ] @xmath117    eqs .",
    "( [ g ] ) and ( [ gderiv ] ) define a 3-surface in the spacetime . one way to obtain a single equation defining such",
    "a surface is to solve ( [ gderiv ] ) for @xmath70 as a function of @xmath12 , wherever possible , and substitute @xmath118 back into ( [ g ] ) .",
    "then the envelope is thus given , in principle , by    @xmath119    in this case , this procedure can be carried out in closed form . using the notation @xmath120 , eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) is equivalent to    @xmath121    with solution    @xmath122    ( the other equation , ( [ g1 ] ) , is the complex conjugate of ( [ g2 ] ) and yields no new information ) .",
    "substituting @xmath118 given by eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) and its complex conjugate @xmath123 into eq.([g ] ) yields    @xmath124    where the minus sign is for the future lightcone and the plus sign for the past lightcone of the point @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the set of three equations ( [ g2implies ] ) and ( [ g ] ) are equivalent to the lens and time of arrival equations . because there is no time occurrence in ( [ g2implies ] ) , then one can think of it as the lens equation since it relates the spatial position of source @xmath125 to its corresponding image on the celestial sphere @xmath8 . in principle , solving for two of @xmath125 in terms of @xmath8 and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) turns eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) into an equation relating the time of emission @xmath0 from a source at @xmath125 with image direction @xmath8 seen at the observer @xmath18 .",
    "in geometrical terms , a thin lens can be modeled as a spacetime with vanishing curvature everywhere except at a timelike surface , where the `` lens '' lives .",
    "accordingly , the spacetime consists of two flat spacetimes , matched appropriately at the lens worldsheet , with the observer lying in one flat spacetime and the source lying in the other one .",
    "we refer to these two flat spacetimes as the observer s side and the source s side of the spacetime .",
    "it is clear that the families of null surfaces to be used on the observer s side of the spacetime are all the null planes that contain the observer s location , labeled by the direction of the null normal . on the source s side ,",
    "however , the appropriate null surfaces to use are not null planes but the distortion of the null planes by the lens . for this reason they must , in general , be given in parametric form .",
    "we use the parametric method , via eq .",
    "( [ parametricg ] ) , explained in section ii , for the envelope construction .    for the purpose of clarity of presentation , we first develop our construction of the null surfaces in a lower - dimensional setting .",
    "we then generalize the argument to 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath126 lensing setting is described in cartesian coordinates @xmath127 .",
    "the observer is at @xmath128 , and the lens surface is a plane located at @xmath129 .",
    "the metric of the spacetime is flat everywhere except at the lens plane :    @xmath130    our aim is to construct a 1-parameter family of null foliations which in principle can be given as the level surfaces of a function @xmath131 which replaces the @xmath132 of the four dimensional lensing scenario .",
    "( the origin , @xmath18 , is omitted . )",
    "this function will be entirely equivalent to the fermat potential in this lensing scenario , and the envelope of the surfaces @xmath133 will simultaneously give us the lens equation and time of arrival . in the approximation of small angles",
    ", the fermat potential and the lens equation will reduce to the standard astrophysical lensing scenario .",
    "roughly our construction is as follows ; we define a 1-parameter family of null surfaces , ( parametrized by @xmath134 ) by imagining a straight line of photons traveling ( backwards in time ) parallel to each other ( null rays ) in a direction making an angle @xmath134 with the @xmath135axis . as the photons move , they trace a null plane in the spacetime . the moment each photon arrives at the lens plane , it is `` detained '' for a length of time @xmath136 that depends only on the point at which the photon hits the lens plane . after this time",
    ", the photon is released in a new direction @xmath137 , deviating by an angle @xmath138 from its original direction .",
    "the bending angle @xmath138 depends only on the point at which the photon hits the lens plane , and it should be entirely determined by the `` detention time '' @xmath136 . because different photons arrive at the lens plane at different times and are detained for different lengths of time , the wavefront they make up after leaving the lens plane is not necessarily plane .",
    "the scheme that we have just described has a corresponding analog in the wavefront distortion produced by a thin sheet of glass with a variable index of refraction .",
    "a lightray impinging nearly normally on the sheet will bend inside the glass due to the component of the gradient of the index of refraction perpendicular to its path , exiting the glass with a finite deviation angle .",
    "a plane incident wavefront then comes out of the glass distorted .",
    "the local index of refraction at the point of incidence multiplied by the thickness of the glass is a measure of the time spent by each lightray inside the glass , or equivalently , the `` detention '' time of light inside the glass . for later purposes , it is important that we make following point with respect to the limit in which the thickness of the glass tends to zero .",
    "the `` detention time '' in the region occupied by the glass defined in this way has two contributions : the transit time in vacuum through the region ( the `` vacuum '' time : @xmath139(thickness of the glass ) ) plus the amount of time that light is delayed by the slowing - down in the presence of the medium , with respect to vacuum . in the limit in which the thickness of the glass tends to zero , the first ( vacuum ) term vanishes and",
    "the `` detention time '' coincides with the time delay with respect to vacuum .    in the case of interest to us , the detention time @xmath136 is determined by the gravitational field of a deflector on the lens plane and it coincides with the gravitational time delay with respect to vacuum :    @xmath140    where @xmath141 is the newtonian potential of an isolated mass distribution and the integration takes place along the null ray or line of sight .",

    "the conundrum is resolved by noting that though the @xmath387 are the same the density functions are different .",

    "all our results obtained from the envelope construction now agree with the standard results appearing in the published literature .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the method can be used to extend the results to the case of a lens plane that has a peculiar motion above the hubble flow by letting the velocity of the lens plane in the underlaying flat space be arbitrary .    as a final comment here , we point out that this method of obtaining the frw lens equation and time delay equation by conformal rescaling of an associated minkowski space can be extended , largely unchanged , to any spacetime that is conformally related to minkowski space .",
    "it is not clear whether this observation has any physical application .",
    "we have introduced a novel approach to gravitational lensing built on a variational principle that is analogous to , but distinctly different from , the conventional version of fermat s principle .",
    "our approach is to find the envelope of an appropriate family of null surfaces containing the observer s location .",
    "we have shown how this approach reproduces the astrophysical scenario of static thin lenses as an illustration .",
    "more interestingly , though , we have been able to use this approach to obtain the correction to first order in @xmath265 that the motion of the deflector imposes on the bending angle in the approximation of thin lenses .",
    "this calculation can alternatively be done by direct integration of the null geodesics in time - dependent spacetime perturbations off flat space . in this respect",
    ", our result agrees with such a direct calculation of the bending angle by moving thin lenses carried out by pyne and birkinshaw  @xcite , whereas it differs from others  @xcite by an overall sign and a factor of 2 .",
    "work is in progress to clarify this difference and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "notice that a redshift of 0.001 might conceivably bring this effect into the observable regime in the future .",
    "because in the thin - lens case in cosmology our approach is based entirely on the underlying conformally flat space , we also have an alternative derivation of the lens equation in cosmology , which does not seem to have been exploited in the literature so far .",
    "we feel our derivation clarifies some points that remain obscure in the presentations of the lens mapping in cosmology that appear in @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the reader interested in a very complete derivation of the lens mapping in cosmology by integration of the null geodesics will definitely benefit from the excellent article by pyne and birkinshaw  @xcite .    throughout this work",
    ", we have assumed that a metric is given that represents the structure of the deflector or lens . in this sense , we have kept ourselves within the kinematics of the implicit fermat potential .",
    "we have not addressed the issue of the dynamics of the fermat potential , namely : how the implicit fermat potential is directly affected by the structure of the deflectors .",
    "the resolution of this important question in principle involves two steps : to solve the einstein equations for the metric , and then to use the metric as a given source into the eikonal equation for the implicit fermat potential .",
    "by contrast , in the standard thin - lens scenario , the fermat potential is obtained directly from the surface mass distribution by means of a 2-dimensional equation of the poisson type .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether an analogous scheme to obtain field equations for the implicit fermat potential directly in terms of the structure of the deflector exists in cases other than the thin - lens scenario .",
    "this question will be discussed elsewhere .            which relates the ratio of conformal factors @xmath403 to the cosmological scale factor @xmath404 , at two different points , the observer and the lens , that are connected by a null geodesic .",
    "the quantity @xmath405 is the velocity of the lens in the associated minkowski coordinates evaluated as the ray leaves the lens .    for the case of @xmath325",
    "this result is trivially true since then @xmath406 and @xmath407 for ease of presentation we will only give the proof for the @xmath324 spacetime , but the calculations are exactly paralled in the case of @xmath323 and the result is exactly the same .",
