    "despite that the standard model @xmath5 describes very successfully all the experimental data within the range of energies available today , it has many unsolved problems , such as the problem of mass , @xmath6 violation and the number of generations , etc . , and the failure of the unification of electroweak and strong forces .",
    "for this reason one would expect that a more fundamental theory should exist , which describes the three forces within the context of a single group .",
    "recent @xmath7 data shows that this indeed can be achieved in supersymmetric grand unified theories @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the minimal supersymmetric extension of the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) predicts the existence of many new particles ( supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles ) and the higgs sector of the theory contains two higgs doublets in order to give mass to the up and down quarks @xcite .",
    "the physical higgs spectrum of the @xmath9 is richer than the @xmath8 and contains two @xmath6-even and one @xmath6-odd neutral higgs bosons and a charged higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 extension of the @xmath8 leads to clear and distinct experimental signatures especially in the higgs sector .",
    "the search for the higgs sector of the @xmath9 constitutes one of the main research fields in the existing and future accelerators to which theoretical physicists focus their attention .",
    "a lot of theoretical work in the literature has been devoted to the production and decay channels of higgs particles , in particular the pseudoscalar neutral higgs - boson @xmath0 , in various reactions ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . here in this work",
    ", we investigate the production of the @xmath0 in the polarized @xmath1 beams , namely in the process @xmath10 , at the center of mass energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "note that production of the @xmath0 without polarization in @xmath1 beams , is studied in @xcite",
    ". however , the numerical results presented in that work , for the cross - sections of the the unpolarized beams , are over estimated and approximately 20 times larger than ours .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we calculate the cross - section for @xmath0 production .",
    "we present our numerical results and give a discussion about them in sect.3 .",
    "the process @xmath10 is described by two type of diagrams : box and triangle diagrams . from quite a number of diagrams , however , the main contributions arise from triangle ones with photon exchange .",
    "this is clear from the fact that , the photon pole diagrams give the dominant contributions since @xmath14 is in the physical region .",
    "contributions of the triangle diagrams with @xmath15-boson exchange and box diagrams give negligible contributions than that of photon exchange diagrams , since these diagrams are non - singular at @xmath14 .",
    "therefore these contributions are all disregarded in this present work . on the other hand since the @xmath16 extension of the @xmath8 is considered , the charged chargino contributions are included .",
    "the amplitude for the pseudoscalar @xmath0 production in the @xmath10 process can be written as = |u(p_2 ) _",
    "u(p_1 ) _ ( p_1-p_2)_k_1 _  .",
    "[ eq1 ] here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the momenta of the final and initial electrons , respectively , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the photon momentum and polarization , @xmath21 , and the loop factor @xmath22 is given as , f(t)&= & - n_c q^2_t m^2_t cot ( ) c_0(t , m_a^0 ^ 2,m_t^2 ) - n_c q^2_b m^2_b tan ( ) c_0(t , m_a^0 ^ 2,m_b^2 ) + & & -  m^2_tan ( ) c_0(t , m_a^0 ^",

    "following @xcite , we also consider two different cases : @xmath36 ( case-1 ) and @xmath37 ( case-2 ) , for which g_11&= &   , + g_22&=&-   , and g_11&= &   , + g_22&=&-   , respectively . in further analysis",
    "we will take @xmath38 .",
    "the scalar function @xmath39 entering in ( 2 ) is given as ( since in the present case one of the external particles is a photon ) , c_0t , m^2_1,m^2_2 = c - c  , where , c(x)&=&_0 ^ 1 log 1-xy(1-y)-i +   + & = & \\ {    ll  2 sinh^-1 ^2 &   x0 +   + -  2 sin^-1 ^2 &   0x 4 +   +  2 cosh^-1 ^2 - + 2 i cosh^-1 &   x 4  .    .",
    "using eq.(1 ) and performing summation over final electron spin and taking into account the polarization of the initial particle for the cross - section , we get = ^2  , where , ^2= s^2+u^2+_2 ( s+u)^2  . here",
    "we take @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the longitudinal polarization of the electron and circular polarization of the photon , respectively . from eq.(8 ) it follows that the expression for the differential cross - section contains the @xmath44 term and therefore in order to obtain the total cross - section for the subprocess , one must introduce a convenient cut - off parameter in the lower bound of the integration , namely , either the the mass of the electron or the cut - off parameter for the angle . by imposing the angular cut - off ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath45 the expression for the total cross - section takes the following form ( see also @xcite ) : _ e()= _ - m_a^0 ^ 2 ^ - m_a^0 ^ 2 ^2+u^2+_2 ( + u)^2 f(y ) ^2  , where , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the momentum fraction of the electron carried out by the photon .",
    "explicit calculations show that , the contribution of the @xmath48 exchange diagram to the total cross - section is negligible than that of the photon exchange diagram .    it is well known that the high energy @xmath49 colliders can be converted into high energy @xmath1 colliders with the help of the back - scattered laser beams @xcite .",
    "so , taking into consideration the distribution function of the back - scattered photons , the total cross - section for the @xmath10 process can be calculated by = _ ^0.83 dx  g_(x ) ( sx )  , where , @xmath50 is given by eq.(10 ) , the explicit form of the distribution function is @xcite g_(x)&= &  , where , d_1&= & 1 - x + - +  , + d_2&= & 1 - - log 1 + + + -  . in our numerical calculations we take @xmath51 .",
    "we present our numerical results for the cross - sections for various values of @xmath28 in a series of graphs .",
    "the dependence of the cross - section on @xmath52 at different values of the circular polarization @xmath43 of the photon is presented in fig.1 and fig.2 for case-1 at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "a similar graphical analysis is illustrated for case-2 in fig.3 and fig.4 . in the numerical calculations , for the largest chargino mass we take @xmath53 and for @xmath27",
    "we take the largest value consistent with the restriction @xmath54}$ ] , where upper and lower signs correspond to case-1 and case-2 , respectively .",
    "such restrictions are needed in order to ensure that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are real .",
    "the choice we made for @xmath26 and @xmath27 in this article , is within the range of the chargino masses that are found in the @xmath16 theories .",
    "further , we checked for the contribution coming from @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and charginos separately .",
    "our calculations show that , for larger values of @xmath28 the contributions arising from @xmath57 lepton and charginos become important .",
    "our starting point is the analysis of case-2 . for @xmath58 , the cross - section decreases with increasing values of @xmath52 and around @xmath59",
    ", it reaches a deep minimum value , which from that point on it starts increasing and attains its maximum value at @xmath60 , and then decreases smoothly again . for larger values of @xmath28 ( i.e. , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the behavior of the cross - section is absolutely different and it gets its first maximum value around @xmath59 , contrary to the previous case .",
    "the second maximum point is again around @xmath60 .",
    "note that , at @xmath12 , around the point @xmath63 , a new maximum value for the cross - section shows itself , which is totally absent in the @xmath11 case .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , the locations of the maximum values of the cross - section are all independent of @xmath28 .",
    "similar situation holds for all other values @xmath43 of the circular polarization of the photon .",
    "the different behavior of the cross - section for the small and large values of @xmath28 is due to the increase in the contributions arising from the @xmath57-lepton and charginos .",
    "similar arguments hold for case-1 as well , but with the following differences : for almost all values of @xmath28 the cross - section has its maximum value located around the same point @xmath59 , while for @xmath64 and @xmath65 it has a minimum around the point @xmath66 .    for all cases the maximum value of the cross - section is about @xmath67 .",
    "if we assume that the integral luminosity at @xmath11 is @xmath68 and at @xmath12 is @xmath69 @xcite , we have at most 2 events for @xmath11 and 12 events for @xmath12 .    from the analysis of all graphs",
    ", we can deduce the following result : for the detection of @xmath0 , the @xmath58 case is more preferable . at @xmath11 ,",
    "when @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , it seems that it is possible to detect @xmath0 with a mass around @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "similar situation is present for @xmath12 , but with one important difference . for the case",
    "@xmath70 at @xmath58 , it is possible to detect @xmath0 with a mass around @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that for this value of the @xmath28 , the cross - section for the case @xmath70 , is larger than that of @xmath71 .",
    "few words about the possibility of detecting @xmath0 in experiments should be mentioned . in order to detect @xmath0 in real experiments",
    ", we must take the decay products of @xmath0 into account and separate the background processes from the signal of the @xmath0 decay with the same final state particles .",
    "the main decay channels of @xmath0 are @xcite : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . if @xmath82 , in the minimal supersymmetric models the dominant decay mode of @xmath0 is @xmath72 ( for more detail see @xcite ) .",
    "this decay mode is dominant even above the top quark threshold up to @xmath83 @xcite . in this case",
    "we can also neglect the chargino contributions since they are smaller than the one arising from @xmath84 mode ( see @xcite ) . therefore , in our case the main process which is responsible for detecting @xmath0 is @xmath85 with a branching ratio of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in this case the main background process is the direct @xmath84 production in @xmath87 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison of our results on cross - section and the background process @xmath87 @xcite leads to the conclusion that at @xmath2 the background process dominates for all values of @xmath88 . on the other hand at @xmath89 , and @xmath90",
    "the @xmath84 signal from @xmath0 can be detected with a mass @xmath60 .",
    "finally we would like to discuss the following question : can we deduce any extra information about the mass of @xmath0 , if we investigate the polarization asymmetry due to the longitudinal and circular polarization of the initial electron and photon , respectively ? in order to answer this question , we presented in fig.(5 ) the behavior of polarization asymmetry versus @xmath91 at different values of @xmath52 .",
    "we clearly observe that when @xmath59 polarization asymmetry approaches to zero around @xmath92 , and this value of energy is far from the maximum available energy range of the present colliders .",
    "moreover , it follows from this figure that , the dependence of polarization asymmetry on @xmath91 at different values of @xmath52 , is practically the same .",
    "therefore , in our opinion , the polarization asymmetry is not a convenient tool for deducing extra information about the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "our final conclusion is that , in search of the pseudo - scalar @xmath0 in @xmath1 collider , with the preferred choice of @xmath58 , it is possible to detect the pseudoscalar @xmath0 with a mass of @xmath60 .",
