    "the observational evidence inferred from the spatial variations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature suggests that the curvature perturbations that are present prior to decoupling ( but after equality ) must be predominantly adiabatic and gaussian with an ( almost ) scale - invariant spectrum @xcite .",
    "a mode is defined to be ( predominantly ) adiabatic if the fluctuations of the entropy density are subleading after matter - radiation equality ( but prior to decoupling ) .",
    "an exactly adiabatic mode of curvature fluctuations may be produced , for instance , by single - field inflationary models .",
    "if this is the case , the scalar fluctuations of the inflaton field ( with wavelength larger than the hubble radius ) are transferred to curvature fluctuations whose value stays ( almost ) frozen from the early stages of the evolution of the universe until the pre - decoupling epoch when the minute spatial variations of the geometry are imprinted , via the sachs - wolfe effect , on large - scale temperature inhomogeneities .",
    "in addition to adiabatic fluctuations there may be one or more non - adiabatic modes sometimes named ( with a somehow confusing terminology ) isocurvature modes . the specific number of ( regular )",
    "isocurvature modes ( up to four ) is determined by the physical properties of the plasma where curvature fluctuations evolve . a mode , in the present terminology",
    ", simply means a consistent solution of the governing equations of the metric and plasma fluctuations , i.e. a consistent solution of the perturbed einstein equations and of the lower multipoles of the boltzmann hierarchy .",
    "consider as an example the physical system formed by two fluids , i.e. radiation and pressureless matter .",
    "this is a pretty good approximation in the description of pre - decoupling physics if the radiation is identified with the sum of photons and neutrinos and the pressureless fluid accounts for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) component . if this is the case , the plasma suports not only an adiabatic mode , but also a non - adiabatic mode for which the entropy fluctuations of the cdm - radiation system do not vanish @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that the pre - decoupling curvature fluctuations have a dominant ( adiabatic ) contribution and a subdominant ( entropic ) correction .",
    "sticking to the simplified situation described above , the large - scale contribution to the angular power spectrum would be determined by three pre - decoupling power spectra , i.e. the spectrum of the adiabatic mode , the spectrum of the entropic mode and the spectrum of their cross - correlation .",
    "this possibility leads to a rich parameter space and to an interesting phenomenological framework ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "as an example in ref .",
    "@xcite a recent likelihood analysis determined the isocurvature fraction allowed by wmap data ( as well as by large scale structure data ) by taking into account both the adiabatic and the entropic contribution of the cdm - radiation system .",
    "the study of isocurvature and entropy modes is often conducted within a two - fluid system because of the inherent mathematical complications related with the possible proliferation of non - adiabatic modes .",
    "it will be demonstrated here that the presence of a large - scale magnetic fields during the pre - decoupling epoch affects the whole system of curvature and entropy perturbations both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "if the origin of large - scale magnetic fields is primordial ( as opposed to astrophysical ) it is plausible to expect that the pre - decoupling plasma is effectively magnetized .",
    "different studies have been devoted , in recent years , to constrain a hypothetical primeval magnetic field from cmb studies ( see @xcite for a short review and @xcite for a more extended discussion ) . indeed",
    ", large - scale magnetic fields that are present in the pre - decoupling epoch may affect the polarization power spectra ( both the ee , bb and eb angular power spectra ) either directly @xcite or through the faraday effect @xcite that may rotate an initial e mode ( produced thanks to the polarized nature of thompson scattering ) into a b mode . barrow and subramanian , in a series of papers @xcite , analyzed the vector modes ( and the polarization power spectra ) induced by large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "recently @xcite a numerical approach has been developed to analyze vector and tensor modes .",
    "vector , as well as tensor modes have been discussed also in @xcite .",
    "while the effect of vector modes will be crucial at small scales ( i.e. @xmath0 ) the contribution of tensor modes may be relevant also for larger scales ( i.e. @xmath1 ) .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields induce vector and tensor modes but also various scalar modes whose classification and analysis will be one of the themes of the present investigation . more specifically , large - scale magnetic fields affect the usual adiabatic and entropic modes @xcite that may be present in the pre - decoupling epoch .",
    "in fact , the divergence of the magnetohydrodynamical lorentz force influences the tight - coupling evolution of photons and baryons .",
    "moreover , the magnetic fields gravitate .",
    "therefore , they contribute to the hamiltonian constraint and ( in a weaker fashion ) to the momentum constraint . in @xcite , an interesting covariant approach for the analysis of cosmological perturbations induced by large - scale magnetic fields has been proposed and further developed in @xcite .",
    "the approach used in @xcite was to assume a background magnetic field which uniform but , at the same time , sufficiently weak not to break the isotropy of the background geometry .",
    "the present approach is more similar to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite where the magnetic field has been taken fully inhomogeneous .",
    "moreover , the problems related to the present analysis concern the specific modifications induced by large - scale magnetic fields on the adiabatic and non - adiabatic modes that are normally used to set initial conditions for cmb anisotropies .",
    "this goal requires a full description of the magnetized photon - baryon system in the presence of neutrinos and cdm particles both before and after decoupling .",
    "the strategy would then be to study how large - scale magnetic fields affect the system of equations describing adiabatic and non - adiabatic modes before the time of radiation - matter equality , i.e. deep in the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "the magnetized solutions will be then evolved both analytically and numerically across the radiation - matter transition and up to the time of photon decoupling .",
    "as mentioned , large - scale magnetic fields are assumed here to be fully inhomogeneous and characterized by an appropriate two - point function . in this way",
    "the spatial isotropy of the background geometryis not broken and the line element can then be written , in the spatially flat case , as @xmath2 , \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the conformal time coordinate and @xmath4 is the scale factor . defining the appropriately rescaled magnetic fields as @xmath5 ( see section2 ) , the relevant two - point function can be written ( see the appendix for a summary on the conventions ) as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the magnetic field power spectrum and @xmath8 .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields will be treated here in a magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) approximation @xcite in curved space - time .",
    "this description is justified by different considerations .",
    "in fact , before decoupling , not only the plasma is globally neutral but the value of the debye scale much smaller than the hubble radius and it is also much smaller than the electron and photon mean free path @xcite . as far as the magnetic properties of the system are concerned",
    ", the plasma behaves , in this situation , as a single ( intrinsically charged but globally neutral ) fluid where the total ohmic current is solenoidal and the ohmic electric fields are suppressed by the finite value of the conductivity .",
    "the same kind of mhd description has been used also in the analysis of the vector and tensor modes of the geometry ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that it would be incorrect to use the same kind of mhd approximation in the analysis of faraday effect ( as sometimes assumed ) .",
    "faraday effect concerns the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a cold ( or warm ) plasma and can not be treated within mhd which is valid for typical frequencies much smaller than the plasma frequency and typical scales much larger than the debye scale .",
    "so in full analogy with the discussion of faraday effect in the laboratory ( see for instance @xcite ) a two - fluid description is mandatory @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of the mhd approach is that magnetic flux and magnetic helicity will be , to a good approximation , conserved in the limit of large conductivity @xcite . in the friedmann - robertson - walker background ( [ metric ] )",
    ", flux conservation implies that the magnetic field strength increases as @xmath9 as we go back in time . at the present time magnetic fields",
    "are observed , at the @xmath10 g level , in galaxies @xcite , clusters @xcite and in some superclusters @xcite .",
    "even if the fields have different properties in diverse classes of structures and even if the determination of magnetic fields in superclusters is still in progress , it is rather plausible to admit that we live in a sort of magnetized universe @xcite . in the case of galaxies , if the magnetic field present prior to gravitational collapse was of the order of @xmath11 ng , compressional amplification alone could have produced the observed magnetic field even without the need of a dynamo action . in recent years",
    "interesting progresses have been made in the analysis of the dynamo problem especially in connection with the role of global conservation laws of magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the protogalactic field could be much smaller than @xmath11 ng and still be explain the observed magnetic fields in galaxies , while in this framework cluster magnetic fields are related to the way dynamo saturates .",
    "aside from this consideration , if we blue - shift a protogalactic magnetic field ( coherent over a typical mpc scale ) of @xmath11 n g at the epoch of photon decoupling we will end up with a magnetic field of mg strength that can potentially affect cmb anisotropies . the mechanisms that may produce magnetic fields will not be specifically examined and we refer the reader to a recent revies @xcite . however , most of the mechanisms predict a stochastically distributed magnetic field that does not break spatial isotropy",
    ". it will then be interesting to scrutinize the implications of a pre - decoupling field on the scalar cmb anisotropies . in this sense",
    "the ambition of the present approach is a model - indepedent approach that is similar to recent attempts of constraining mixtures of adiabatic and non - adiabatic modes in spite of their specific origin ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    to be more specific , the strategy will be to treat the magnetic fields as a further element of the primordial plasma that may contain both adiabatic ( or entropic ) and non - adiabatic modes . in doing a gauge invariant description",
    "will be adopted since , as it will be illustrated , a simpler description of the matter - radiation transition can be achieved .",
    "to say anything concerning cmb anisotropies we have to estimate what is the value of curvature perturbations after equality ( but before decoupling ) and in the long wavelength limit . , the long wavelengths , in the present terminology , are the ones satisfying @xmath12 . ]",
    "such an estimate , is , unfortunately , not available in the present literature .",
    "it is then appropriate to introduce the description developed in this paper by defining the density contrast on uniform curvature hypersurfaces , conventionally denoted by @xmath13 @xcite @xmath14 where the prime denotes a derivation with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the ( total ) background fluid density while @xmath17 is the pressure .",

    "( [ zetaidef1 ] ) the relative fluctuations in the entropy density @xmath23 can be defined as @xmath24 in this language , the adiabatic mode corresponds to the situation where @xmath25 and @xmath26 for each fluid of the mixture .",

    "( [ zetator ] ) can be neglected and @xmath13 is approximately equal to @xmath27 .",

    "the logic followed in the present investigation will then be to provide a fully gauge - invariant system of equations where the evolution of magnetized curvature and entropy modes can be characterized as regular solutions deep in the radiation - dominated regime .",
    "then the various modes will be followed across the radiation - transition both analytically and numerically .    in section 2",
    "a gauge - invariant system of governing equations will be proposed for the simultaneous description of magnetized adiabatic and entropy modes . in section 3",
    "the analysis of various magnetized modes will be presented in the realistic situation where the plasma is constituted by a mixture of baryons , neutrinos , cdm and photons.the fate of the regular magnetized modes across the radiation - matter equality will be discussed in section 4 .",

    "some more phenomenological considerations on the properties of the sachs - wolfe plateau will be discussed with the aim of providing a possible starting point for more specific numerical discussions .",
