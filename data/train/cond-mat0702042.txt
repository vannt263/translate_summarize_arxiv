    "the persistence of enhanced longitudinal drag resistance  @xcite up to very high @xmath7 provides additional support to our choice of @xmath176 which can explain the remaining intercorrelation ( drag ) in the case where explicit tunneling is absent . finally , as @xmath195",
    ", both resistances go to zero , the bilayer decouples and bosons vanish from the system .",
    "our picture is certainly incomplete because it does not explicitly include the effects of disorder ( which must be very relevant for the physics of bilayer in the regimes @xmath4 - a simple way to see this is to look at the behavior of measured counterflow resistances  @xcite @xmath196 , @xmath197 that enter the insulating regime very quickly after passing through @xmath5 ) .",
    "fertig and murthy  @xcite provided a realistic model for the effects of disorder and in their disorder - induced coherence network in the incompressible phase of the bilayer , merons are able to sweep by hopping across the system , causing the activated behavior of resistance ( dissipation ) in counterflow .",
    "this finding is consistent with our own .    at the end",
    "our picture is in the spirit of the stern and halperin proposal  @xcite but instead of the @xmath198 compressible phase coexisting in a phase separated picture with the superfluid phase ( @xmath26 ) , we assume the existence of the vortex metal phase ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "this coincides with the fertig and murthy proposal  @xcite for the incompressible region that explains the `` imperfect '' superfluid behavior .",
    "it is the continuous extrapolation of this phase separated picture that brings and favors @xmath176 for larger @xmath7 ( instead of @xmath26 ) .",
    "there @xmath176 is able to explain the persistence of intercorrelations through enhanced longitudinal drag accompanied by the absence of tunneling and phase coherence .",
    "@xcite    finally , we are able to account for the effects of the layer density imbalance in tunneling , drag  @xcite and counterflow  @xcite experiments .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite observed that small density imbalance stabilizes the resonant tunneling peak - a simple reason for this is that @xmath26 can easily accommodate the fluctuations in density ( see comment after eq.([flux - particle 1 ] ) ) . because of the same reason ,",
    "hall drag resistance remains quantized up to larger @xmath7 in the presence of density imbalance . on the other hand ,",
    "the enhancement of longitudinal drag resistance at large @xmath7 was also reported  @xcite to be insensitive to density imbalance . while the reason for this can not be seen only from looking at the form of @xmath176 ( this state constrains both fermion and boson numbers in two layers , see comment after eq .",
    "[ flux - particle 2 ] ) , we believe that meron excitations are responsible for absorbing the density fluctuations , especially at finite @xmath191 .",
    "recently , the quantum hall bilayer was probed using resonant rayleigh scattering  @xcite for samples with different tunneling amplitudes and when the in - plane magnetic field is present .",
    "they detected a nonuniform spatial structure in the vicinity of the transition , suggesting a phase - separated version of the ground state .",
    "our results ( for zero tunneling limit and excluding disorder ) hint that such phase separation may indeed be necessary to invoke in order to achieve a full description of the strongly - coupled , incompressible phase and the transition in a bilayer .",
    "in conclusion we showed how two model states , @xmath26 and @xmath176 , can account for the basic phenomenology of the bilayer that came up from various experiments .",
    "a very interesting question pertains the model state @xmath176 . as effectively a state that represents a collection of meron excitations interacting through topological interactions ,",
    "a question comes when they are in a confined ( dipole ) phase and when in a metallic ( plasma ) phase .",
    "so in principle we can expect that the static correlator in eq .",
    "( [ long range order psi2 ] ) can be reproduced by considering a 2d bosonic model with meron excitations interacting via 2d coulomb plasma interaction .",
    "@xcite therefore we believe that the laughlin ansatz  @xcite of considering ( static ) ground state correlators as statistical models in 2d can be applied here also .",
    "we expect that the ground state correlators in a dual approach , in which we switch from composite fermion to meron coordinates , can be mapped to a partition function of a 2d coulomb plasma .",
    "@xcite the 2d coulomb plasma has two different phases . for large @xmath199 ( inverse @xmath191 ) the charges form dipoles and the system is with long range correlations ( no mass gap ) .",
    "at some critical @xmath199 , dissociation of dipoles occurs and we have a plasma phase with a debye screening , and therefore a mass gap . thus calculations that will capture more of the meron contribution than our rpa approach in the chern - simons theory may find a transition and exponential decay of the correlator ( eq .  ( [ long range order psi2 ] ) ) , before reaching @xmath200 limit . indeed",
    "our odlro exponent in eq .",
    "( [ long range order psi2 ] ) at @xmath200 is @xmath27 which is well above the exponent of the bkt transition or critical exponent @xmath201 . at that point",
    "our system may develop a gap in the pseudospin channel and completely lose interlayer coherence ( exponential decay of correlators ) .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the superfluid portion of the composite boson density will disappear leading to compressible behavior in the charge channel .",
    "@xcite this is all consistent with experiments  @xcite which find that , at @xmath202 , the vanishing of the conventional quantum hall effect and the system s josephson - like tunneling characteristics occurs simultaneously .",
    "intercorrelated bosons continue to exist without a superfluid property and lead to enhanced @xmath203 drag at large @xmath7 .",
    "they disappear from the system around @xmath204  @xcite .",
    "the work was supported by grant no .",
    "141035 of the ministry of science of the republic of serbia .",
    "in order to extract the response functions in functional integral formalism , one needs to integrate over all degrees of freedom except those of the external fields .",
    "the integration of these fields in the rpa approximation proverbially reduces to the gaussian integral : @xmath205\\\\ \\nonumber = \\frac{\\pi}{w}\\verb\"exp\"\\left [ \\frac{u * v}{w}\\right ] , \\mathrm{re } w>0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the pseudospin channel in the case of @xmath24 ( eq .  ( [ psi1 ] ) )",
    "we therefore obtain the following linear response : @xmath206 where @xmath207 @xmath208^{-1}$ ] and @xmath209 .",
