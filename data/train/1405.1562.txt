    "an interesting and appealing topic in population ecology is the understanding of the diversity and community composition of the populations which ultimately determine the overall stability of an ecosystem .",
    "the predators have in general a rigid type of feeding pattern , which may be the choice of a specific prey or it may be dependent on the abundancy of the prey . in this latter case looking for resources",
    ", the predator moves toward another prey , which may be present in the same or in another habitat .",
    "this mechanism of preferential predation is named switching , @xcite .",
    "many examples of predator feeding switching have been identified in nature , @xcite , as well as in laboratory experiments involving _ notonecta _ and _ ischnura _ , @xcite .",
    "several mathematical models have been proposed with predator switching involving one predator with two prey species @xcite .    in an omnivory food web ,",
    "a predator consumes more than one prey species .",
    "in particular , in a tri - trophic food chain with omnivory , top predator predates both the bottom prey and the intermediate predator @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is also termed intraguild predation ( igp ) , defined as the feeding of the intermediate predator by a top predator that can also consume the prey of the intermediate predator @xcite .",
    "thus , the top predator and the intermediate predator species are also potentially competitors for the common resource , i.e. the prey at the lowest trophic level .",
    "this fact enhances the chance of switching feeding behavior of the top predator between the bottom prey and the intermediate predator .    whether predator switching phenomena",
    "act as a stabilizing or destabilizing factors in a dynamical population system is still debated , see @xcite and the references therein . a stabilizing effect",
    "is found for instance in ref .",
    "intraguild predation with nonlinear functional responses had been investigated showing that omnivory could be a stabilizing factor @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "intraguild predation could destabilize a three species lotka - volterra model with linear functional responses , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lotka - volterra model of intraguild predation could exhibit a limit cycle , coexistence of all species in igp system is possible if the intermediate predator is superior at exploitative competition for the prey , whereas the top predator gains significantly from its consumption of intermediate predator @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the top predator may become extinct if the predation rate and the conversion efficiency from the prey to predator are very low , whereas the intermediate predator will disappear if the predation rate and the conversion efficiency from prey to predator are high enough . also recently , in the very same model , chaotic behavior has been numerically discovered , @xcite .",
    "the findings indicate that the system enters into a chaotic regime from a stable steady state through period doubling hopf - bifurcation , if the consumption rate of top predator on the primary prey increases .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to incorporate predator switching in a three species lotka - volterra model with linear functional response and investigate its effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after discussing some preliminary biological background ,",
    "we introduce the model in section 3 , and analyse its behavior in the following section . the main result , control of the chaotic behavior , is contained in the final section .",
    "predator feeding switching is an important aspect in nature , @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of predator switching in an omnivory system , also known as intraguild predation , does not appear to be properly investigated yet .",
    "as far as our knowledge goes , no attempt has been made so far to model the behavior of such intraguild predation in the presence of predator switching . in a tri - trophic food chain or food web with omnivory",
    "the top predator consumes more than one prey population . if the predator population has more than one resource to prey upon , namely the prey and middle predators , the predator population predates more heavily either on the preferred or on the most abundant species , @xcite , depending on the specific situation . whenever the primary resource declines and while waiting that it recovers , the predator for its survival feeds on another prey , in the same or another habitat .",
    "experimental results suggest that predator switching is a very resemble biological phenomena to omnivory and likely to occur with it @xcite .",
    "however , the predator switching and the omnivory do not yet appear to be studied simultaneously . in ref .",
    "@xcite holt and polis have intuitively suggested that if the adaptive foraging by the omnivore predator leads to switching between the prey and the intermediate predator , the system will be stabilized .",
    "our aim is to investigate and substantiate this claim , by providing a theoretical setting for the effect of predator feeding switching in omnivory system considering a suitable mathematical model .",
    "in the three species food chain model proposed by tanabe and namba ( 2005 ) , @xcite chaotic behavior is discovered .",
    "we want to consider a modification of this model , incorporating top predator feeding switching behavior in it .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively denote the prey , middle predator and top predator populations sizes .",
    "the resulting system of equations reads as follows @xmath3 as it occurs for the switching models , the system ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] ) is not well defined at the origin . to overcome the occurrence of the singularity there ,",
    "we simply replace the above equations at @xmath4 by the following ones : @xmath5    the meaning of the parameters , all nonnegative , is as follows : @xmath6 is the prey intrinsic net growth rate , while @xmath7 denotes their intraspecific competition for resources .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 with @xmath9 denote the prey consumption rates , while @xmath8 for @xmath10 represent the corresponding predators assimilation rates .",
    "the natural mortalities of the intermediate and top predators are respectively @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the first equation expresses logistic growth of the prey in absence of predators . when they are present , the prey are subject to their hunting . in absence of prey ,",
    "the intermediate predator is bound to starve ; in the food chain it also represents a possible source of food for the top predator .",
    "the latter feeds on both prey and intermediate predators .",
    "the novel feature of this model resides in the last terms of the first two equations and the corresponding last two terms of the last equation , modelling the feeding switching behavior between the two types of prey for the top predator , following @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is governed by the relative abundances of the bottom prey and intermediate predators .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 represents the switching intensity .",
    "this parameter provides also a mean to obtain a continuum of models . in fact , note that for @xmath14 the system shows no switching behavior , it becomes exactly the tanabe and namba three species omnivory system , @xcite , while for @xmath15 the switching function is the same function defined by tansky , @xcite .",
    "this parameter thus allows to control the amount of switching feeding that the top predator can use .",
    "the steady states that ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] ) can attain are the five points @xmath16 , @xmath17 . the origin @xmath18 , representing ecosystem disappearance , fortunately can not be stably attained .    the bottom prey - only equilibrium @xmath19 in which the prey settles at carrying capacity @xmath20 is locally asymptotically stable if both predator s mortalities are large enough , @xmath21    the bottom prey can thrive also in presence of either one of the predators , @xmath22    these equilibria are locally asymptotically stable if the following conditions respectively hold @xmath23 for @xmath24 , i.e. the mortality of the intermediate predator must be higher than the one of the top predator , while for @xmath25 we must have @xmath26 expressing the fact that the top predator mortality should be higher than a certain threshold , which is regulated by the other populations equilibrium values .",
    "the study of the coexistence equilibrium appears to be a very difficult task . even establishing the existence of the equilibrium amounts to solve a highly nonlinear algebraic system .",
    "an attempt along these lines has been made in @xcite , see also @xcite , but will not be repeated here .",
    "rather , numerical simulations show the feasibility and stability of this point , fig .",
    "[ stable_focus ] .",
    "this is obtained using the parameter set , mostly taken from @xcite , @xmath27 in fact , stability hinges on the conditions @xmath28 for the details see the appendix .",
    "the above parameter choice indeed gives @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. the routh - hurwitz stability criterion is satisfied .",
    "this is further checked by the eigenvalues of ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] ) which have all negative real parts , namely @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    ", @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of time.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]  , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of time.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]  , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of time.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    chaotic behavior , as discovered in @xcite can be analytically be shown to arise also in this more general model .",
    "again we refer the reader to the appendix for the detailed calculations .    for the set of parameter values ( [ param ] ) , the eigenvalues of the characteristic equation of the system ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] ) are @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore we can expect theoretically the occurrence of silnikov chaos at the coexistence equilibrium @xmath37 of the system ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] ) .",
    "this theoretical finding is shown in the bifurcation diagram of fig .",

    "left to right , the diagrams for the populations @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] +    clearly , if the top predator hunting rate on the bottom prey gradually increases , the system loses stability and becomes chaotic .",
    "our main purpose here is to investigate the role that predators feeding switching possibly has on the system s behavior . recalling that ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] )",
    "exhibits a continuum of models in terms of the switching intensity , we present a simulation for the bifurcation behavior of the coexistence equilibrium .    ) in terms of the bifurcation parameter @xmath13 . here @xmath39 and all the other parameter values are those given in ( [ param]).,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]  ) in terms of the bifurcation parameter @xmath13 . here @xmath39 and all the other parameter values are those given in ( [ param]).,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]  ) in terms of the bifurcation parameter @xmath13 . here @xmath39 and all the other parameter values are those given in ( [ param]).,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    the bifurcation diagram of fig .",
    "[ bifurcation_2 ] shows that the system ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] ) switches its behavior from chaos to a stable focus if the switching intensity increases above a threshold value , which is found to be approximately @xmath40 . for @xmath41 the model ( [ eq : eqn1.2 ] ) exhibits chaotic oscillations while past that value the coexistence equilibrium is stably achieved .",
    "our analytical and numerical results indicate thus that if the switching intensity is above a threshold value , then the omnivory system from the chaotic oscillations achieves a stable behavior , thereby suggesting that predator switching can in fact enhance the persistence and stability of an omnivory system .",
    "a possible explanation could be provided as follows .",
    "when a particular prey species population declines , possibly partly owing to the predation , the predator instead of wasting time in looking for this scarce resource switches its attacks to the next more abundant available prey . in this way ,",
    "none of the prey populations is drastically reduced , because hunting stops or reduces drastically when its numbers decline , nor any prey population is allowed to become too much abundant , because in this case the predation will resume .",
    "such mechanism mediates the prey predator interaction in an omnivory system and thus enhances the stability and the persistence of the system itself .",
