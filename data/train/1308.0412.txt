    "skyrmions were originally introduced by the british particle physicist tony skyrme to describe localized , particle - like configurations in the field of pion particles.@xcite since that seminal paper , skyrmions have been developed in many fields , including classical liquids,@xcite liquid crystals,@xcite bose - einstein condensates,@xcite quantum hall magnets,@xcite and two - dimensional isotropic magnetic materials.@xcite they also have been theoretically predicted to exist in magnets with the dmi.@xcite recently , many experiments have proved their existence in helical magnets , such as mnsi@xcite and @xmath2.@xcite however , most of the skyrmions occurring in helimagnets were induced by an external magnetic field and only at low temperatures,@xcite which limits the technological application of skyrmions.@xcite efforts have been made to resolve part of these problems .",
    "for example , yu et al.@xcite have obtained a skyrmion crystal near room - temperature in the helimagnet fege with a high helical transition temperature ( 280 k ) , but assisted by an external magnetic field .",
    "heinze et al.@xcite observed a spontaneous atomic - scale magnetic ground - state skyrmion lattice in a monolayer fe film , but still at a low temperature ( about 11 k ) . despite all these efforts , spontaneous skyrmion - like magnetic ground states at or above room temperature",
    "have not been reported .",
    "skyrmions existing in helimagnets are always associated with the chiral magnetic interactions , the so - called dmi , which favors canted spin configuration.@xcite we note that the magnetostatic interaction favors spin canting and divergence - free spin alignment to reduce the total energy,@xcite an effect similar to that of the dmi .",
    "for example , confined magnetic thin films can exhibit variant topological spin textures such as vortex - like or meron - like states.@xcite therefore , spontaneous ground state of skyrmion - like configurations may be obtainable in ordinary magnets of nanostructures without the dmi .",
    "topologically nontrivial magnetic nanostructures have attracted long - standing attention due to their peculiar spin configurations and dynamic behaviors for promising technological applications , and in particular to the rich physics involved.@xcite extensive theoretical and experimental research has revealed their dynamics depending on their topological charges and spin textures.@xcite the topological structure of skyrmions distinguishes from magnetic vortex and bubble .",
    "therefore , we expect a novel dynamical behavior in skyrmions .    in this work ,",
    "we report direct observation of a spontaneous ground state of skyrmion - like configuration in co / ru / co nanodisks without the dmi by micromagnetic simulations .",
    "we observe a novel gyration of the guiding center ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) of skyrmions with a star - like trajectory in a pulsed magnetic field and a hexagonal trajectory after the field is switched off , which is different from the pentagram trajectory of the mean position ( x , y ) of magnetic bubbles.@xcite moreover , the gyration of skyrmion in the bottom nanolayer without the presence of field can be stimulated by the motion of skyrmion in the top nanolayer .",

    "spin textures in both the top and the bottom nanolayers are skyrmions .",
    "the hexagonal - close - packed ( hcp ) co / ru / co nanodisks with high curie temperature and large uniaxial anisotropy are used to study formation and gyrotropic motion of skyrmions without the dmi by the three - dimensional object oriented micromagnetic framework ( oommf ) code.@xcite the material parameters of hexagonal - close - packed ( hcp ) cobalt chosen include saturation magnetization m@xmath3=1.4@xmath410@xmath5 a / m , exchange stiffness a=3@xmath410@xmath6 j / m and uniaxial anisotropy constant k@xmath7=5.2@xmath410@xmath8 j / m@xmath9 with the direction perpendicular to the nanodisk plane .",
    "hcp ( 0001 ) co / ru / co multilayers can be prepared by electron - beam evaporation , magnetron sputtering deposition or ultrahigh vacuum deposition.@xcite interfacial coupling coefficients of the adjacent surfaces for different thicknesses of ru were from ref . .",
    "the thickness of co was tuned from 5 to 25 nm ; that of ru , from 1 to 20 nm .",
    "the diameter of a co / ru / co nanodisk in the phase diagram and gyration was chosen to be 200 nm . to study the diameter dependence of the skyrmion radius , the diameter of co ( 20 nm)/ru ( 2 nm)/co ( 20 nm ) was from 160 to 210 nm .",
    "the cell size was 4@xmath44@xmath41 nm@xmath9 for simulating magnetic ground states , which is smaller than the exchange length of cobalt ( about 4.94 nm ) . at phase boundaries ,",
    "the cell size was reduced to 2@xmath42@xmath41 nm@xmath9 to test stability of the obtained states .",
    "the dimensionless damping @xmath10 was chosen to be 0.25 for rapid convergence .",
    "different initial magnetic states [ vortex - like ( with same or opposite chirality ) , in - plane - like and out - of - plane - like initial states ] were used to get the most stable ground state . as for gyration simulation ,",
    "the cell size was 2@xmath42@xmath42 nm@xmath9 and @xmath10 was 0.02 .",
    "a pulsed magnetic field of 10-ns width and 50-mt magnitude along the + x direction was applied to the top or bottom nanolayer .",

    "the equilibrium states of the top and bottom nanolayers are typical skyrmion - like magnetic configurations .",
    "the magnetization * m * is down ( along -z axis ) in the centers and up ( along + z axis ) on the boundaries and it rotates gradually from -z axis to + z axis at the intermediate regions of the nanolayers .",

    "similar magnetic spin textures have been found in a patterned co / ru / co nanodisk array with the diameter the same as that of the single co / ru / co nanodisk .",
    "the distance between centers of two nearest neighboring nanodisks was 250 nm , as shown in fig .",
    "the result suggests that a stray field between two nearest neighboring nanodisks ( 250 nm apart ) has little influence on the skyrmion spin textures .",
    "the formation of magnetic stable states is the consequence of minimizing the gibbs free energy of magnetic systems .",
    "figure [ fig3](a ) illustrates time dependences of the total energy , exchange energy , uniaxial anisotropy energy , demagnetization energy , and antiferromagnetic coupling energy for the case in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the exchange energy , uniaxial anisotropy energy , and demagnetization energy are two orders of magnitude higher than the interfacial antiferromagnetic coupling energy and , thus , are vital to the emergence of a skyrmion spin texture . at the beginning ,",
    "the out - of - plane - like initial state has a very high value of total energy due to the significant demagnetization energy . to lower the total energy , the demagnetization energy decreases rapidly with time , whereas the exchange energy and uniaxial anisotropy energy both increase significantly",
    "a balance is reached and the total energy is almost unchanged after 0.5 ns .",

    "but in this work , skyrmions are spontaneously formed without the dmi . as discussed above ,",
    "the competition among the exchange energy , demagnetization energy , and uniaxial anisotropy energy plays a significant role in the emergence of skyrmions . to quantify the competition effect",
    ", we define a quantity to mimic the dmi : @xmath15 from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we calculate @xmath16 as a function of time on both the top and the bottom co nanolayers [ see fig .",

    "notably , when energies compete drastically with each other before 0.5 ns in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the @xmath16 for both co nanolayers significantly changes .",
    "then all energies reach equilibrium and @xmath16 remains relatively unchanged after 0.8 ns .",
    "this indicates that the competition among the three energies can produce an effect similar to that of the dmi to form skyrmions .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the phase diagram of the magnetic ground state of a co / ru / co nanodisk as a function of the thicknesses of ruthenium ( @xmath17 ) and cobalt ( @xmath18 ) derived from micromagnetic simulations .",
    "@xmath17 is changed from 1 to 20 nm , and @xmath18 from 5 to 25 nm , with a fixed diameter of 200 nm .",
    "the phase diagram shows four regions : the vortex - like state , skyrmion - like state , multidomain state and mixed state ( more than one stable or metastable state ) .",
    "stable skyrmions can exist only in a small fraction of the phase diagram with @xmath18 appropriately chosen and @xmath17 smaller than 4 nm . this is obviously a delicate balance between different energies , especially the interlayer magnetostatic interaction .",
    "if @xmath18 goes beyond 25 nm , regardless of @xmath17 , the multidomain state appears to minimize the demagnetization energy .",
    "if the separation layer of ru gets very thick where the interlayer magnetostatic interaction between two co nanolayers becomes diluted , the intralayer demagnetization factor starts to play a more essential role , constraining the local magnetization in plane to form the vortex state . though we have been emphasizing the importance of interlayer magnetostatic interaction by controlling the @xmath17 , it is still not sufficient to reduce just the @xmath17 for the skyrmion state .",

    "the magnetization increases almost linearly with the magnetic field until saturation at 0.64 t , where skyrmions are suppressed completely .",
    "concurrently , skyrmion numbers of the top and bottom nanolayers change slightly , from approximately -1 to -0.9 , and rise sharply , up to about 0 , when the field is up to 0.64 t. to investigate the spatial distribution of magnetization , we show the _ r _ dependence of @xmath19 in figs . [ fig5](b ) . @xmath19 is defined as the averaged angle between the local magnetization and + z axis in the range of ( r , r+dr ) as described in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath19 at zero magnetic field is typically skyrmion - like and rules out the possible existence of cylindrical bubble domains.@xcite besides , the distribution of magnetization does not match the belavin - polyakov ( bp ) @xcite solution as demonstrated in fig .",

    "align rigidly till the critical saturation field ( 0.64 t ) is reached .",
    "@xmath19 at the edge remains always tilted from a 0 value , possibly due to the stray field at the edge , which results in the absence of a small fraction of the order parameter sphere when the skyrmion is mapped from real space to an order parameter sphere as illustrated in fig .",
    "in contrast to the rigidity of magnetization in the center and at the edge , @xmath19 in the intermediate region decreases gradually with the field , which has a variation tendency similar to that reported in ref . .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] indicates that skyrmions remain in a similar configuration under the external field even up to 0.44 t , which is much higher than the reported one@xcite .",
    "obviously , the skyrmion obtained in the nanodisk is quite robust .     ]",
    "we also investigated the gyrotropic motion of the guiding center of skyrmions . the guiding center ( @xmath0,@xmath1 )",
    "is essential for the dynamics of a skyrmion , which is defined by the moments of the topological density:@xcite @xmath20 where q is the topological density defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "first , a pulsed magnetic field of 10-ns width and 50-mt magnitude is applied along the + x direction on the top nanolayer , as demonstrated in fig . [ fig6](a ) .",
    "the guiding center gyrates towards its new equlibrium position along the field , which is different from the motion of the vortex.@xcite the trajectory of ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) of the top nanolayer is initially like a star ( before 2.4 ns ) , then an elliptical orbit , and , finally , is damped around its new equilibrium position ( 33.5 nm , 0 nm ) , represented by the filled black circle .",
    "stimulated by the gyrotropic motion of the top skyrmion through strong interlayer magnetostatic interaction , the skyrmions in the bottom nanolayer without the presence of a field almost synchronously gyrate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) . this indirect control of skyrmion motion may be used in information - signal processing and spin devices.@xcite once the field is turned off , ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) in both nanolayers begin to gyrate back to the origin ( 0,0 ) , as shown in figs . [ fig6](c ) and [ fig6](d ) .",
    "initally , the trajectories of the two guiding centers of skyrmions are hexagons ( before 15.24 ns ) , which is similar to hypocycloid involute .",
    "the period of this hexagon - like motion is approximately t=1 ns ( i.e. , frequency _ _ f__=1 ghz ) .",
    "the average velocity in the first period is about 200 m / s .",
    "the corresponding fft spectra of the novel trajectories illustrate two eigenfrequencies of 0.96 and 4.98 ghz with a ratio of about 1:5 as illustrated in fig .",
    "these unique trajectories of ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) have never been observed in other topological magnetic systems ( vortices or bubbles ) , which usually have a circular or elliptical orbit .",
    "note that a pentagram trajectory resulting from the deformation of circular domain wall in magnetic bubble was reported previously,@xcite which is about the mean position ( x , y ) defined by the moments of the magnetization .",
    "however , hexagon - like trajectories in this work are due to the distribution variance of the topological density of the whole system and about the guiding centers ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) defined by the moments of the topological density .",
    "moreover , the motion of skyrmion can not be correctly described by the mean position ( x , y ) .",
    "therefore , our hexagon - like trajectories of ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) in skyrmion is sharply different from the pentagram trajectory of ( x , y ) in magnetic bubble .",
    "these may be understood by their differences in topological charges and spin textures as well as the strong magnetostatic interaction of the double - skyrmion system ( detailed analysis will be discussed in future work ) .",
    "after 14.24 ns , gyration orbits change to circular ones .",
    "the influence of skyrmion chirality on the guiding center of skyrmion gyration is illustrated in fig .",

    "this missing region corresponds to about 0.5% of the sphere area",
    ". nevertheless , the mapped region can still give rise to a skyrmion number ( about -0.995 ) close to -1.0 for a fully mapped skyrmion sphere .",

    "the solid ( red ) line is the bp solution for the nonlinear so(3 ) @xmath22 model .",
    "skyrmions obtained in the co / ru / co nanodisks do not match the bp solution . in these nanodisks , the competition among exchange energy , uniaxial anisotropy energy , and demagnetization energy results in the formation of a skyrmion spin configuration instead of the single exchange energy considered in the bp solution .     as a function of x ( x = r / r ) for different diameters of co ( 20 nm)/ru ( 2 nm)/co ( 20 nm ) nanodisks .",

    "the competition of the exchange energy , demagnetization energy , and uniaxial anisotropy energy acts similarly to the dmi and thus leads to the formation of an intriguing skyrmion texture .",
    "this nontrivial topological spin texture is very stable even against an external magnetic field up to 0.44 t , higher than the highest reported value , about 0.3 t. we observe a novel gyration of the guiding centers ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) with a star - like trajectory in a magnetic field and a hexagonal trajectory after the field is switched off .",
    "we also observe synchronous gyrotropic motions of two skyrmions in two co nanolayers ( one with a field , the other one without ) .",
    "these unique gyrotropic motions of the skyrmion are distinguished from the magnetic vortex or bubble and contribute to the understanding of the dynamical properties of skyrmions .",
