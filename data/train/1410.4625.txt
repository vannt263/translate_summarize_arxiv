    "many mathematical models arising from physics , biology , finance or other areas of science involve subsystems evolving on different time scales . often , there is a fast and a slow component and the limiting behavior of the latter is an interesting non - trivial problem .",
    "one possible setting is a system of diffusion processes @xmath0 satisfying the stochastic differential equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a @xmath3-dimensional vector function and @xmath4 is a one - dimensional vector function , @xmath5 is an @xmath6-dimensional brownian motion , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are @xmath9 and @xmath10 matrix valued functions respectively .",
    "this process depends on a parameter @xmath11 representing the ratio of the two time scales . in other words , @xmath12 changes faster and faster in time as @xmath13 , while @xmath14 changes on the same time scale for all values of @xmath15 . @xmath16 and @xmath14",
    "are referred to as the fast and the slow component respectively .",
    "the case when the fast motion has a finite invariant measure @xmath17 was first studied by khasminskii ( @xcite ) and is well understood by now .",
    "he proved that , as @xmath13 , the law of the slow component @xmath14 approaches that of a limiting diffusion @xmath18 , and one can obtain the effective drift and diffusion coefficients of @xmath18 by averaging @xmath2 and @xmath8 in the first variable with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "this result was later extended and refined by a vast number of authors ( see e.g @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , or the monograph @xcite ) .",
    "much less is known about what happens when the fast motion does not posess a finite invariant measure . in the case when the process is null recurrent , and there is a @xmath8-finite invariant measure , naive intuition would suggest that the limit ( if it exists ) would be a diffusion with coefficients averaged with respect to this measure . however , this is false due to the fact that @xmath16 spends most of the time in the neighborhood of infinity .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath19 and there exist constants @xmath20 such that @xmath21 then the asymptotic behavior of @xmath14 is governed by values of @xmath2 and @xmath8 when @xmath22 is very large ( under the assumption that they are non - zero ) .",
    "as , in general , these values can be different for positive and negative values of @xmath23 , @xmath14 does not converge to a markov process .",
    "indeed , it was shown that , under certain assumptions on the large @xmath22 behavior of @xmath7 , @xmath2 , and @xmath8 , the pair @xmath24 converges weakly to a @xmath25-dimensional diffusion with diffusion coefficient discontinous at @xmath26 .    in this paper , we are interested in the case when @xmath19 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath8 are very small as @xmath29 .",
    "the result cited above ( @xcite ) then implies that @xmath14 converges to the solution of the ordinary differential equation @xmath30 ( see also lemma [ lem : y_close_to_y ] ) , and the slow motion can be considered as a perturbation of this ode .",
    "this situation can be intuitively understood by noting that a typical trajectory of the process @xmath31 is of order @xmath32 , and therefore @xmath28 and @xmath8 are small .",
    "this implies that @xmath33 can not deviate significantly from the unperturbed solution on a finite time scale .",
    "we show that the first correction term is @xmath34 and study the limiting behavior of the process @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the solution of the unperturbed system .",
    "the main ingredient is that the bulk of the deviation comes from the displacement when @xmath16 is at distance @xmath37 from the origin , which suggests that the natural time scale to look at is defined by the local time @xmath38 at @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that in order to obtain a markov process in the limit , it is necessary to keep track of both component .",
    "indeed , we derive a limit theorem for the pair @xmath39 .    in the general case , the large @xmath22 behavior of @xmath7 can be different depending on the sign of @xmath23 .",
    "this creates a discontinuity in the diffusion coefficient of the limit of @xmath40 and one has to consider convergence to a limiting process with a certain boundary behaviour at @xmath26 .",
    "another difficulty is posed by the fact that the noise driving the fast and the slow motion are the same . in the absence of these complications , however , a proof using only elementary stochastic calculus is possible .",
    "our result captures the phenomenon without much technical difficulties .",
    "therefore , we consider a simplified system in this paper and return to the general case in an upcoming publication .",
    "one motivation to study these systems is to describe certain systems with an interface where significant transport is possible only in a thin layer , see e.g. @xcite for a recent result .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after we state our precise result in section [ sec : main_result ] , we prove some preliminary lemmas in section [ sec : aux_lemma ] . in section [ sec : reducing_to_simple ] , we show that the case @xmath41 can be reduced to a simpler problem which is solved in section [ sec : proof_of_main_result ] .",
    "we extend the result to non - constant @xmath7 in section [ sec : non_unit_varphi ] .",
    "we begin by stating the result in the special case where the fast motion is a brownian motion .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be independent one and @xmath3-dimensional brownian motions and consider the following @xmath3-dimensional non - homogeneous stochastic differential equation @xmath44dt+\\sigma(\\epsilon^{-1}w_1(t),y^{\\varepsilon}(t))dw_2(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with initial condition @xmath45 .",
    "assume that @xmath46 we also assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are globally lipschitz continuous in @xmath23 and @xmath49 , and that @xmath50 is twice continuously differentiable with bounded derivatives .",
    "it follows from the above that the ordinary differential equation @xmath51 which serves as the unperturbed part of the slow motion , has a unique solution defined for all times .    to describe the limiting process ,",
    "let us introduce the process @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are independent @xmath55 and @xmath3 dimensional brownian motions respectively and @xmath56 is the local time of @xmath53 at @xmath57 .",
    "it is a continuous , non - markovian process that only grows on a set of lebesgue measure zero with probability one .",
    "note that the non - markovity is rather innocent in this case as the pair @xmath58 is markovian .",
    "also note that the conditional law @xmath59 is gaussian .",
    "we mention that @xmath60 is a known process , in the literature it is called @xmath61-fractional kinetic process and it appears as the scaling limit of certain randomly trapped random walks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the connection is intuitively explained by considering the time the fast process spends away from the origin as a trapping for the slow component with a heavy tail trapping time ( due to null - recurrence ) .",
    "as another example , brownian motion time changed by the local time of a more complicated process was obtained as the limit of a diffusion in a cellular flow ( @xcite ) .",
