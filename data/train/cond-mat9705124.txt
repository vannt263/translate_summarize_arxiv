    "one of the strange features of high - temperature cuprate superconductors , a normal - state gap in the density of states , remains a subject of controversy .",
    "a great deal of experimental evidence ( nmr,@xcite optical conductivity,@xcite specific heat,@xcite and , most recently , angle - resolved photoemission@xcite ) seems to indicate that the superconducting energy gap survives the transition to the normal state and disappears only at a considerably higher temperature .",
    "even the anisotropic character of the gap is preserved .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of `` underdoped '' compounds , in which doping of additional hole carriers increases the temperature of the superconducting transition @xmath1 .",
    "there is no generally accepted theoretical model of this phenomenon , although arguably the most popular tentative explanation puts the blame on superconducting fluctuations near the transition point , which are expected to be enhanced in these highly anisotropic , almost two - dimensional , materials .",
    "while monte - carlo simulations of the attractive hubbard model in two dimensions provide numerical evidence@xcite for the pairs - above-@xmath1 scenario , no analytical description of the pseudogap regime has been offered so far .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide such a sketch .",
    "suppose that the pseudogap in cuprates does have the same origin as the superconducting gap  the scattering between fermion and hole states with the charge @xmath2 released in the form of a low - energy cooper pair .",
    "this picture rests on certain assumptions . simply saying that cooper pairs are present above @xmath1 as a propagating mode is not enough .",
    "it is important that the fluctuating pairing field @xmath3 look frozen on the time scale @xmath4 , otherwise the pseudogap will not be formed . since the typical frequency of free propagating bosons in thermal equilibrium",
    "is given by their temperature , the pseudogap is expected to exist at temperatures @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is loosely defined to be of order @xmath7 . in general",
    ", it may also be necessary to require the _ spatial _ coherence of the pairing field over a pair size @xmath8 . in this particular model , however , the boson velocity is of order of the fermi velocity @xmath9 , so that as long as the pairing fluctuations are slow in time , they are also slow in space .    in a somewhat arbitrary way , @xmath6 can be identified with the transition temperature calculated in the bcs theory . as in any other mean - field theory ,",
    "the onset of a long - range order coincides with the appearance of a short - range order ( formation of pairs ) , the assumption being that the phase of the order parameter will lock up as soon as there is a non - zero amplitude .",
    "this , of course , breaks down in two spatial dimensions , as shown long ago by hohenberg.@xcite in a highly anisotropic , almost two - dimensional system , long - range order sets in at a temperature @xmath10 . above @xmath6 , cooper pairs decay",
    "; between @xmath6 and @xmath1 , they represent a propagating mode ; finally , below @xmath1 , they form a bose condensate . in the intermediate range ,",
    "at least when @xmath11 , they represent a slowly fluctuating bcs pairing field and thus create a pseudogap . a well - defined pseudogap regime may be a peculiarity of low - dimensional systems .",
    "a theoretical framework for treating the interplay between fermions and their boson - like bound states is thus needed . following pioneering works by eagles,@xcite leggett,@xcite and nozieres and schmitt - rink,@xcite several approximate methods",
    "have been suggested : the boson - fermion model,@xcite functional integration,@xcite and the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximation.@xcite in most cases , however , one has to resort to numerical computations .",
    "the present work is written with the purpose to provide an analytical sketch of a _ normal state with a pseudogap_. as such , it inevitably contains further simplifications , which hopefully do not alter the nature of the problem : ( 1 ) the decay of low - energy bosons is neglected .",
    "( 2 ) a clear separation of energy scales is assumed : @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the fermi energy ) .    using the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approach ,",
    "i derive approximate propagators for fermions and cooper pairs .",
    "the width of the pseudogap is determined by the mean - square fluctuation of the pairing field @xmath14 in a thermal ensemble .",
    "this expectation value depends , among other things , on the energy spectrum of cooper pairs , which in turn is a function of the fermion energy spectrum . a closed set of coupled equations results , allowing one to determine the condensation temperature of pairs .",
    "the so determined @xmath1 is proportional to the fermion density and inverse mass , as seen on the uemura@xcite plot .",
    "this is despite the fact that , as long as @xmath15 , the system is not in the limit of local ( tightly bound ) pairs .",
    "i also give a reason why quasiparticle peaks are quite broad near the fermi surface , even when thermal fluctuations are slow ( @xmath16 ) . if correct , this sketch may provide a simple way to understand two puzzling features of underdoped cuprate superconductors  the pseudogap and the doping dependence of @xmath1  from a unified standpoint .",

    "a well - pronounced suppression of the fermion density of states near zero energy makes room for long - lived pair states inside the gap . at low momenta and frequencies ,",
    "they represent a bogoliubov sound - like mode with a non - zero mass .",
    "the mass is determined from a self - consistency condition that links the width of the pseudogap to the mean fluctuation of the pairing amplitude .",
    "zero mass signals the onset of bose condensation . in @xmath172 dimensions , the condensation temperature scales as @xmath178 , which is @xmath179 times the condensation temperature for the corresponding ideal bose gas .",
    "this may explain the doping dependence of @xmath1 in underdoped cuprates .",
    "approximations made in this work are twofold .",
    "first , an infinite hierarchy of equations for @xmath26-particle green s functions is replaced with the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approach of brueckner , which partially accounts for gaussian pairing fluctuations . by solving an exact model with an independent pairing field ,",
    "i show that the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximation takes into account the amplitude fluctuations of cooper pairs in the normal state , a feature missing in other approximate models.@xcite further approximations made in this paper are necessary to obtain an analytic solution .",
    "firstly , thermally excited non - uniform configurations of the pairing field have little effect on the fermion propagator , provided that a clear separation of energy scales , @xmath180 , exists .",
    "this appears to be the case in @xmath172 dimensions , _",
    "i.e. , _ for highly anisotropic , almost two - dimensional systems . secondly , a residual density of fermionic states in the pseudogap , leading to the decay of cooper pairs , is assumed to have negligible influence on the pair energy spectrum .",
    "a numerical work using the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approach@xcite seems to indicate that this is a reasonable assumption : low - energy cooper pairs represent a propagating mode with two cooper - pair poles dispersing with the pair momentum . in order to ascertain that propagating cooper pairs in the pseudogap are not an artifact of the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximation ,",
    "it is necessary to look for them in quantum monte - carlo simulations on two - dimensional lattices .",
    "there are many questions that remain open .",
    "for instance , in the case of a superconducting order parameter with nodes , the density of fermion states is less strongly suppressed .",
    "will cooper pairs be stable enough to represent a propagating mode ?",
    "also , what causes the strong broadening of fermion quasiparticle peaks above the temperature at which pairs are formed ?",
    "the idea of this work has originated in conversations with y.  j.  uemura .",
    "i thank a.  s.  blaer , d.  m.  eagles , t.  d.  lee , r.  micnas , m.  randeria , m.  v.  sadovskii , and especially h.  c.  ren for helpful discussions .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the u.  s.  department of energy ( grant de - fg02 - 92 er40699 ) and by nedo ( japan ) .",
    "spontaneous emission or absorption of cooper pairs is not restricted to low boson momenta and thus represents the effect of fast fluctuations .",
    "the emission or absorption rate depends on the phase space available to the products of a fermion decay ( a pair and a hole ) , which tends to be smaller in a lower number of dimensions @xmath139 .",
    "this indeed is confirmed by a simple calculation below . in @xmath169 dimensions ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath181 is linear in @xmath182 and thus leads to a renormalization of the quasiparticle spectral weight . in @xmath153 dimensions ,",
    "a constant imaginary part is introduced , which merely broadens the quasiparticle peak .",
    "besides , the existence of a small parameter in the pseudogap regime ( the ratio @xmath183 ) makes this additional broadening insignificant in @xmath184 dimensions .",
    "let us estimate the impact of `` vacuum '' fluctuations on the self - energy of a fermion with momentum @xmath185 and bare energy @xmath186 .",
    "inasmuch a hole created in the decay can be far away from the fermi surface , we can neglect the influence of pair scattering on its spectrum and treate the hole as a stable particle with momentum @xmath187 and energy @xmath188 neglecting the curvature of the energy surface @xmath59 ; @xmath189 is the angle between @xmath185 and @xmath119 .",
    "the boson energy is taken to be @xmath190 .",
    "then @xmath191 energy conservation requires that @xmath192 for definiteness , let us assume that the frequency of the incoming fermion @xmath193 .",
    "then a pair can be emitted ( @xmath194 ) when @xmath195 and absorbed ( @xmath196 ) when @xmath197 .",
    "pair emission is accompanied by absorption of a second fermion with the energy in the range @xmath198 .",
    "the second fermion can , thus , be taken from _ below _ the fermi surface and",
    "the process will take place even at low temperatures ! on the contrary ,",
    "absorption of a pair requires emission of a second fermion with a negative energy @xmath199 . at low temperatures ,",
    "such states are occupied and pair absorption is suppressed .    in @xmath169 dimensions ,",
    "the element of phase space reduces to @xmath200 .",
    "the integration over the boson energy @xmath201 is elementary because a @xmath202-function is present : @xmath203,\\ ] ] the first term in brackets ( emission of a pair ) grows linearly with @xmath182 . by inserting @xmath141 from ( [ z ] ) , we obtain @xmath204 as @xmath205 .",
    "thus , spontaneous pair emission leads to a significant renormalization of the fermion propagator ( the ratio @xmath206 is not small for the pseudogap regime in @xmath169 ) and can not be neglected .    in @xmath153 dimensions ,",
    "pair emission has a smaller available phase space : @xmath207 the self - energy does not vary with @xmath182 if @xmath208 is replaced with the step - function .",
    "this channel of decay is characterized by the rate @xmath209 where @xmath210 . in @xmath172 dimensions , @xmath211 and",
    "this additional linewidth is small in comparison with the broadening caused by induced fluctuations , of order @xmath212 .",
    "therefore , the effect of fast spontaneous fluctuations can be neglected in @xmath172 dimensions .",
