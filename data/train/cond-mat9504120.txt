    "the interplay between kondo screening of localised spins by conduction electrons , and ordering of these spins due to the rkky interaction is a central issue in heavy fermion physics .",
    "recently , a class of systems has been studied @xcite in which the ordering temperature is driven to zero as a function of concentration , and the paramagnetic metal displays non fermi liquid ( nfl ) behaviour near this @xmath1 quantum critical point .",
    "the compound @xmath2 is one of the best documented among these systems @xcite . in this case , the low - temperature ordered state is reported to be a spin - glass for @xmath3 , while the system remains a paramagnet down to the lowest temperature studied for @xmath4 .",
    "it is still debated @xcite whether the nfl behaviour of the @xmath5 system is a single - ion effect or results from the above competition and the proximity of the @xmath1 critical point .",
    "the aim of this paper is not to resolve this debate for this particular system , but to demonstrate that nfl behaviour is indeed a generic feature of the vicinity of a @xmath1 paramagnetic metal to metallic spin - glass transition .",
    "this will be shown by solving specific models at mean - field level .",
    "the models that we shall study are mean - field versions of the kondo lattice , with an additional quenched randomness on the exchange interactions between localised spins .",
    "we consider localised spins @xmath6 on a fully connected lattice of @xmath7 sites @xmath8 .",
    "these spins interact with a bath of conduction electrons . in the model that we shall consider first",
    ", a major simplification will be made : the conduction electron bath will be assumed to consist of _ independent _ `` reservoirs '' of electrons , with no communication between the reservoirs at different sites .",
    "the effect of releasing this simplifying assumption will be discussed in sec.[mod2 ] at the end of this paper .",
    "the conduction electrons will be denoted by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a spin index , @xmath11 labels the conduction band orbitals , and the site index @xmath12 labels the reservoir associated with site @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model reads : @xmath14 in this expression , @xmath15 is the conduction electron spin - density at site @xmath13 , and @xmath16 the strength of the kondo coupling between the localised spins and the conduction electrons ( taken to be antiferromagnetic ) . besides this coupling ,",
    "the spins have a direct interaction between one another : the @xmath17 s are quenched independent random variables with a distribution @xmath18 .",
    "a further simplification of our model is that only the ising part of the exchange interaction has been included . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the model reduces to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model of a classical ising spin - glass @xcite with a freezing transition at @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath21 , we have a system of independent localised spins , each one being quenched by the kondo effect with its conduction electron reservoir , and the system has no long - range order down to @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in the intermediate behaviour where the spin - glass freezing due to the random exchange competes with the local kondo effect .",
    "because the model is fully connected , it can be reduced to a single - site problem after taking the ( quenched ) average over the realizations of the random couplings . in order to describe also the spin - glass phase ,",
    "we may introduce replicated variables labeled by indices @xmath22 . using standard techniques @xcite , the single - site effective action",
    "is found to be ( with obvious notations ) : @xmath23 in this equation , @xmath24 is simply the bare on - site propagator for the conduction electrons : @xmath25 , which can be taken to have the characteristic form associated with a flat band without loss of generality : @xmath26 .",
    "the non - local spin interaction @xmath27 must satisfy the following self - consistency condition in the thermodynamic limit @xmath28 : @xmath29 in the following , we shall mainly be concerned with the paramagnetic phase in which replica symmetry holds , so that @xmath30 is non - zero only for @xmath31 . in the spin - glass phase ,",
    "@xmath27 is non - zero ( but @xmath32-independent ) for @xmath33 , and the edwards - anderson order parameter is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the problem defined by eqs.([seff],[scspin ] ) is still too complicated to be solved exactly , even in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "however , it can be related to a solvable problem , which can be shown to have the same qualitative phase diagram and the same low - frequency and low - temperature universal properties .",
    "to arrive at this solvable model , we have to go through two additional steps .",
    "the first one is to `` integrate out '' conduction electrons in @xmath35 , so that an action involving only spin degrees of freedom is obtained .",
    "this can not be done exactly because of the kondo interaction , but can be done asymptotically at low - energies by following the classic anderson - yuval - hamann approach to the kondo problem @xcite .",
    "this approach consists in separating the kondo term into an ising part @xmath36 and a spin - flip part , and performing an expansion in the spin - flip term to all orders .",
    "the result of this procedure is a mapping of the kondo part of @xmath35 onto an action involving an effective interaction for the ising components of the spins .",
    "this effective interaction is retarded and decays as @xmath37 for large ( imaginary time ) separations @xmath32 .",
    "thus , low - energy properties of the model can be studied by replacing @xmath35 with : @xmath38 s_b^z(\\tau ' ) \\label{seffprime}\\ ] ] in which @xmath39 at large @xmath32 , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is a dimensionless parameter depending on the anisotropy of the kondo coupling )",
    ". this behaviour must be cutoff at high frequency @xmath42 ( _ i.e _ at short time separation ) . because the decay @xmath39 only holds for times up to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the ` bare ' kondo temperature in the absence of the exchange @xmath45",
    ", the cutoff must be chosen as : @xmath46 .",
    "this slow decay of @xmath47 stems from the metallic nature of the spin - glass problem under consideration . in the insulating case considered in @xcite ,",
    "the decay is slower with @xmath48 .",
    "in order to analyze the effective action ( [ seffprime ] ) , we can follow ye , sachdev and read @xcite and generalize the model from ising spins to @xmath50-components quantum rotors @xmath51 , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 at each site .",
    "the ising case formally corresponds to @xmath54 , but the @xmath55 limit will be first solved exactly . enforcing the local constraint by lagrange multipliers @xmath56 , the model is solved in this limit by a saddle - point method @xcite , with @xmath57 uniform at the saddle point .",
    "the free energy of the model reads , in the paramagnetic ( replica symmetric ) phase : @xmath58 \\label{eqf}\\ ] ] where the spin - correlator @xmath59 is given by : @xmath60 the lagrange multiplier @xmath61 is determined by the constraint equation ( equivalent to setting @xmath62 ) : @xmath63      in order to analyze the phase diagram and critical behaviour resulting from these equations , it is very useful to put them in a different form , which will reveal a connection with a different problem already analysed in the literature .",
    "indeed , instead of using a mapping onto the single - site action ( [ seffprime ] ) , we could have solved the @xmath49 rotor model directly for the fully - connected lattice . in this approach ,",
    "the spin correlation function @xmath59 is given by the on - site component of the inverse of the random matrix : @xmath65 .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit @xmath66 , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath17 have a semi - circular distribution given by : @xmath67 hence , the free - energy and spin propagator can be written in the equivalent form : @xmath68\\\\ d(i\\omega_n ) = \\int_{-2j}^{+2j } dx { { \\rho_j(x)}\\over{\\lambda+k(i\\omega_n)-x}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] independently of the low - frequency behaviour of @xmath69 ( metallic or insulating ) , it is clear that only the solutions with @xmath70 are admissible @xcite ( so that no pole is encountered in the integration over @xmath71 ) .",
    "the critical boundary with the spin - glass phase is signalled by @xmath72 reaching the value @xmath73 ( the condition @xmath74 holds throughout the spin - glass phase ) .",
    "thus , the combination @xmath75 plays the role of the important low - energy scale ( which vanishes in the spin - glass phase ) .",
    "universal low - frequency properties are found when this energy scale is small .",
    "these universal properties only depend on the low - frequency behaviour of @xmath69 and on the fact that the spectral density @xmath76 has a square - root behaviour near its upper band edge @xmath77 .",
    "formally , this behaviour is identical to that of fermions with a kinetic energy proportional to @xmath78 in @xmath79 dimensions : we could as well set @xmath80 and replace the integration over @xmath71 in the above equations by an integration over @xmath81 ( with some upper cutoff ) . in this analogy",
    ", the scaling of frequency with respect to @xmath11 is obtained from @xmath82 in the insulating case of ref.@xcite , while @xmath83 in the metallic case .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is a formal equivalence with quantum critical phenomena @xcite in the @xmath84 universality class for the insulating case , and in the @xmath85 universality class for the metallic case of interest here .",
    "the insulating case considered in @xcite corresponds to a ( quantum ) landau - ginzburg model at its upper critical dimension @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 a marginal perturbation ) , while the metallic case amounts to look at this model above its upper critical dimension ( with @xmath87 a dangerously irrelevant perturbation ) . for these reasons ,",
    "many results that will be derived below for the metallic case are formally identical to those of millis @xcite for the @xmath88 case .    in order to derive these results , it is most useful to convert the matsubara sums in the above equations into real - frequency integrations . using @xmath89 ( with an upper cutoff @xmath90 ) , we can write the free energy as : @xmath91 and the constraint equation reads : @xmath92 with : @xmath93 } } \\label{eqchireal}\\ ] ]      the phase diagram resulting from eqs.([eqscreal],[eqchireal ] ) is depicted schematically in fig.[phasediag ] .",
    "it is qualitatively similar to the insulating case @xcite , but the equations for the critical boundary and the various crossover lines are affected by the different low - frequency behaviour of @xmath69 .",
    "some calculations are detailed in the appendix .",
    "for very large @xmath45 , the spin - glass transition temperature is at @xmath20 , the classical value @xcite .",
    "@xmath94 decreases upon increasing quantum fluctuations ( _ i.e _ increasing @xmath16 ) and eventually vanishes for @xmath45 smaller than a critical value : @xmath95 .",
    "near zero temperature , the phase boundary is such that : @xmath96 ( to be contrasted with @xmath97 in the insulating case @xcite ) .",
    "next , we discuss the various crossover regimes @xcite near the @xmath1 quantum critical point at @xmath98 ( _ cf",
    ". _ fig.[phasediag ] ) .",
    "close to this point , and for low frequency and small @xmath99 ( but @xmath100 arbitrary ) , the imaginary part of the local dynamical susceptibility @xmath101 takes the scaling form : @xmath102 the scaling function @xmath103 is easily obtained from ( [ eqd ] ) as : @xmath104 and behaves as @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 . hence , spin excitations are gapless in all regimes , with @xmath109 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "the former , linear behaviour is characteristic of local spin correlations in a fermi liquid with a low - energy scale @xmath99 , while the latter ( which holds down to @xmath113 at the @xmath1 critical point ) deviates strongly from fermi - liquid theory .",
    "@xmath114 is a non - universal constant , and the low - energy scale @xmath115 has different behaviour in different regions of the phase diagram ( fig.[phasediag ] ) .",
    "@xmath116 inside the spin - glass phase , in which @xmath117 with no characteristic scale .",
    "raising temperature at @xmath98 , one enters the _ quantum critical _ ( qc ) regime , in which the physics is dominated by the @xmath1 quantum critical point .",
    "the energy scale @xmath118 is set entirely by temperature in this regime and is found to be @xmath119 .",
    "one would have naively expected @xmath120 but we find a _ violation of this scaling _ in the qc regime of this model . following the connection explained above , this is an effect of the @xmath87 term in the quantum landau - ginzburg model being a dangerously irrelevant perturbation for @xmath121 .",
    "decreasing @xmath45 ( or increasing @xmath44 ) from the @xmath1 critical point , at low enough temperature , one enters the _ quantum disordered _ ( qd ) regime in which @xmath122 ( to dominant order ) .",
    "the crossover between the qc and qd regimes occurs at @xmath123 obtained by matching the two behaviour of @xmath99 given above , with the result : @xmath124 .",
    "as shown below , two distinct regions corresponding to @xmath125 and @xmath126 must actually be distinguished within the qd regime , in which the physical quantities have quite different low - temperature behaviour . in the low - temperature region of the qd regime (",
    "denoted @xmath127 on fig.[phasediag ] ) , the physics is that of a metal showing fermi - liquid behaviour below the coherence scale ( or _ effective _ kondo scale ) @xmath99 , which can be very small because of the competition between the kondo effect and the freezing of the local moments .",
    "however , this interpretation has to be handled with some care , since this scale enters the various physical quantities in quite different manners , as detailed below .",
    "finally , near the phase boundary , there is a _ classical _ regime @xcite for @xmath128 dominated by purely classical fluctuations and in which @xmath129 .",
    "we now investigate the low - temperature behaviour of the specific heat in the various regimes described above .",
    "some details of the calculation are provided in the appendix , but the results could also be directly read off from those in @xcite , given the equivalence with the @xmath130 problem . in the qc regime , the specific - heat coefficient @xmath131 is found to behave as : @xmath132 interestingly , the non - fermi liquid nature of the quantum critical point results in a non - analytic correction to the low - temperature specific heat in this regime . very close to the critical boundary with the spin - glass phase , there is an additional contribution @xcite : @xmath133^{1/2}$ ] ( @xmath134 for @xmath135 ) , which becomes rapidly negligible however as one moves away from the critical boundary .",
    "the non - analytic @xmath136 behaviours continues to hold within the qd regime as long as @xmath137 , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath138 .",
    "this defines an additional subdivision of the qd regime , corresponding to region @xmath139 in fig.[phasediag ] . in the low - temperature ( @xmath127 ) region of the qd regime , ( [ gamma ] ) is replaced by : @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 remains finite as @xmath143 .",
    "next , we discuss the low - temperature behaviour of the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath144 .",
    "this quantity is assumed to be measured by applying a uniform field such that the zeeman energy @xmath145 is smaller than the bare kondo scale @xmath44 .",
    "then , the kondo effect still takes place and the low - frequency behaviour of the resulting propagator @xmath69 is essentially unaffected .",
    "we can thus simply introduce a uniform magnetic field @xmath146 in the effective ising model .",
    "the susceptibility is given by the sum over all pairs of sites of the spin - spin correlation function taken at @xmath147 , namely : namely : @xmath148^{-1}_{ij } } \\ ] ] in this expression , the overbar denotes an averaging over disorder .",
    "the inverse of the random matrix present in this expression can be evaluated by expanding in powers of @xmath149 . because these couplings have random signs and zero - mean , only closed paths ( with @xmath150 )",
    "give a non - zero contribution on the fully - connected ( or bethe ) lattice .",
    "hence , the uniform susceptibility behaves in an identical manner to the _ local _ spin susceptibility : @xmath151 .",
    "note that this relies crucially on the fact that we are dealing with a random system , and would not apply to a a uniform antiferromagnet for example .",
    "hence the formal analogy between the present problem and the @xmath64 quantum antiferromagnet does not apply to the calculation of the susceptibility .",
    "@xmath152 ( and thus @xmath144 ) is easily obtained by setting @xmath153 in eq.([eqd ] ) and taking the real part .",
    "this yields @xmath154 .    in the qc regime ,",
    "we must set @xmath155 , so that : @xmath156 with @xmath157 , and @xmath158 a numerical constant .",
    "a non - analytic correction departing from standard fermi - liquid theory is again found . in the high - temperature part of the qd regime ( @xmath139 region )",
    ", we have ( _ cf . _",
    "appendix ) : @xmath159 , so that : @xmath160 in the low - temperature ( kondo ) region of the qd regime , we have ( _ cf _ appendix ) : @xmath161 , so that : @xmath162 in both ( [ eqchiqd1 ] ) and ( [ eqchiqd2 ] ) , @xmath141 and we emphasize that @xmath157 is non - singular as the critical point is reached .",
    "finally , we consider the nmr relaxation rate , which is directly related to the @xmath113 behaviour of the local dynamical susceptibility through : @xmath163 hence , this quantity always feels the linear regime @xmath164 in the scaling form ( [ scal ] ) . in the qc regime , this yields a temperature dependence of the relaxation rate which differs from the usual korringa behaviour ( @xmath165 ) found in a fermi liquid : @xmath166 in contrast , in both the @xmath139 and the @xmath127 ( ` kondo ' ) regime , the korringa law is obeyed , but with an enhanced rate : @xmath167 we emphasize that in the same regime , the @xmath1 uniform spin susceptibility is _ not _ critically enhanced ( the low - energy scale @xmath99 only enters subleading corrections ) .      before leaving model ( [ ham1 ] )",
    ", we would like to show that the ising case @xmath54 actually has the same universal low - frequency behaviour than the rotor model in the @xmath55 limit that we have analysed in detail . in order to show this ,",
    "one possibility is to adapt the reasoning of refs.@xcite to the present case .",
    "specifically , we can define the spin irreducible self - energy associated with ( [ seffprime ] ) by : @xmath168 . for @xmath49",
    ", @xmath169 reduces to a constant @xmath170 . to order @xmath171 , the first contribution to @xmath172",
    "is from decays into three spin waves . with @xmath173 at the critical point , this leads to @xmath174 .",
    "no non - analyticity with a weaker power of frequency is induced to any order in @xmath171 , and hence the low - frequency behaviour found above at the critical point is unchanged .",
    "another line of reasoning leading to the same conclusion is to use the formal equivalence with the @xmath85 universality class .",
    "going from the @xmath49 to the @xmath54 case just changes the specific coefficients of the various terms of the ( quantum ) landau - ginzburg model , but the equivalence holds for all @xmath50 .",
    "finally , we shall release the assumption of independent kondo baths at each site , and consider a model with a single species of conduction electrons .",
    "we shall consider a lattice of connectivity @xmath175 , and study the hamiltonian : @xmath176 the random exchange couplings are distributed according to a gaussian distribution as above , which is now normalized such that @xmath177 .",
    "the limit of large lattice connectivity @xmath178 will be considered below . in this limit ,",
    "the various green s functions satisfy self - consistent dynamical mean - field equations @xcite .",
    "these equations reduce the model to the solution of a single - site effective action , which has again precisely the form in eq.[seff ] .",
    "however , there is now a self - consistency condition on _ both _",
    "@xmath59 ( given by eq.[scspin ] above ) and @xmath179 , which is not known explicitly in contrast to the case above .",
    "this self - consistency condition depends on the specific lattice and hopping term @xmath180 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath181 stands for the non - interacting density of states of the lattice under consideration , the effective propagator @xmath24 must be such that the following self - consistency equation holds @xcite : @xmath182 in this equation , @xmath183 stands for the local conduction electron green s function @xmath184 , and @xmath185 for the self - energy @xmath186 . both should be viewed as functionals of @xmath179 ( and @xmath59 ) .",
    "a first possibility is to consider a model with a specific form of _ long - range _ hopping ( described in @xcite ) , such that the non - interacting conduction electron density of states is a lorentzian @xmath187 . in this case , the hilbert transform in ( [ scfull ] ) yields : @xmath188^{-1}$ ] , so that @xmath185 disappears altogether from the self - consistency equation and @xmath24 is actually known explicitly as before : @xmath189 .",
    "hence , _ exactly the same equations _ as in the above model ( [ ham1 ] ) with independent kondo baths are found for this model with long - range hopping , and no non - trivial feedback of the conduction electron dynamics into the spin dynamics is possible .",
    "the situation is different for a model with _ short - range hopping _ of the conduction electrons . for definiteness ( but without loss of generality ) , we may consider the @xmath190 bethe lattice , with nearest - neighbour hopping normalised according to @xmath191 .",
    "( this corresponds to a semi - circular d.o.s with a half - width @xmath192 ) . in this case ,",
    "( [ scfull ] ) takes the simpler form : @xmath193 @xmath183 has to be determined from the solution of @xmath35 itself , so that the problem involves a self - consistency condition on _ both _ @xmath59 and @xmath179 .",
    "the main question is whether this `` feedback '' of the non - trivial spin dynamics into @xmath24 can change the low - frequency behaviour of @xmath194 at the @xmath1 critical point .",
    "we shall give an argument that this is not the case , and that ( [ scal ] ) still holds .",
    "let us imagine that the coupled problem ( [ seff],[scspin],[scc ] ) is solved iteratively , starting from a @xmath24 which has the same long - time behaviour than in the model without feedback , namely @xmath195 .",
    "then , the arguments above yield @xmath173 at the critical point . inserting this into the effective action ( [ seff ] )",
    ", we have to compute the conduction electron green s function @xmath183 and feed it back into the self - consistency condition ( [ scc ] ) to see how @xmath24 is affected . in order to find the behaviour of @xmath183 ,",
    "it is convenient to use a representation of the localised spins by pseudo - fermions @xmath196 , such that : @xmath197 .",
    "this amounts to `` undoing '' the schrieffer - wolff transformation and representing the original kondo lattice as a periodic anderson model with a very large @xmath198 in the local moment limit @xmath199 .",
    "we shall not attempt here to find the actual behaviour of the @xmath200-electrons green s functions @xmath201 , but it is easily seen that it can not decay faster than @xmath202 .",
    "indeed , @xmath203 always contains a term of the form @xmath204 ( supplemented by vertex corrections ) , so that a decay slower than @xmath202 is inconsistent with @xmath173 .",
    "furthermore , the slowest possible decay of @xmath201 is the fermi liquid form @xmath205 .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath206 , with the exponent @xmath207 such that @xmath208 . now , the t - matrix associated with ( [ seff ] ) is proportional to @xmath209 , so that the conduction electron green s function is given by : @xmath210 .",
    "hence @xmath211 behaves as @xmath212 at low - frequency . inserting this into the self - consistency equation ( [ scc ] ) in order to see how @xmath24 is affected at the next step of the iteration",
    ", we see that @xmath213 behaves as @xmath214 for large @xmath32 .",
    "because of the constraint above , this exponent satisfies the bounds @xmath215 , so that @xmath24 can not decay faster than @xmath216 at the next iteration .",
    "hence , the associated spectral density @xmath217 can not diverge at @xmath113 : it is either finite or vanishes . for large enough kondo coupling ,",
    "this yields a standard kondo effect @xcite , and hence an effective interaction between ising spins such that @xmath39 as before , so that the behaviour of @xmath194 at the critical point remains unchanged at any step of the iterative solution of the coupled equations .",
    "a perturbative argument can actually be given that the dominant behaviour @xmath218 of the conduction electron green s function is not affected at the @xmath1 critical point , _ i.e _ that @xmath219 .",
    "indeed , if we treat the residual coupling between the conduction electrons and localised spins in second- order perturbation theory , we obtain a contribution to the self - energy : @xmath220 , so that @xmath221 behaves as @xmath222 at @xmath1 .",
    "hence , this scattering is unable to modify the dominant term in the long - time behaviour of @xmath218 .",
    "it has however important consequences for the transport properties near the @xmath1 critical point , as we shall now show .",
    "we first perform a more precise evaluation of the finite - temperature scattering rate to order @xmath223 , which takes the form : @xmath224 inserting the scaling form ( [ scal ] ) , this leads to the following low - frequency and low - temperature dependence , in the quantum critical regime : @xmath225\\ ] ] while in both regions of the qd regime : @xmath226\\ ] ] since we are dealing with a model on a lattice with infinite connectivity , the vertex corrections to the conductivity vanish @xcite , and the @xmath227-conductivity is simply given by : @xmath228 hence , the above calculation of the scattering rate leads to the following non - fermi liquid temperature dependence of the resistivity in the qc regime : @xmath229 while in both regions of the qd regime : @xmath230 with @xmath141 .",
    "hence a fermi liquid behaviour @xmath231 is recovered in the qd regime , but with a critically enhanced rate @xmath232 .",
    "we emphasize that in the same regime , the specific heat coefficient @xmath233 is _ not _ critically enhanced .",
    "this distinguishes the qd fermi - liquid regime from conventional heavy - fermion behaviour in which _ both _ @xmath234 and @xmath233 are large for small @xmath44 , with @xcite @xmath235 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied kondo lattice models with a quenched random exchange between localised spins .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram has been investigated ( fig.[phasediag ] ) and found to display several different regimes near the quantum critical point associated with the @xmath1 spin - glass transition . in the ` quantum critical ' regime ,",
    "the specific heat coefficient and susceptibility display non - analytic corrections to fermi liquid behaviour given by ( [ gamma],[eqchit ] ) , while the nmr relaxation rate ( [ nmrnfl ] ) and resistivity ( [ ronfl ] ) have a non - fermi liquid temperature dependence . in this regime ,",
    "the important low - energy scale violates naive scaling and varies as a power of temperature ( @xmath236 at mean - field level ) . in the low - temperature part of the quantum - disordered region ( ` kondo regime ' ) , fermi - liquid behaviour",
    "is recovered , but the nmr and scattering rate are critically enhanced as the transition is reached , while @xmath233 and @xmath144 are not .",
    "these results may have qualitative relevance for @xmath2 and related systems @xcite since they indicate that non - fermi liquid behaviour is a rather generic feature associated with a @xmath1 spin - glass transition in a metallic system .",
    "however , the reported experimental behaviour ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 ) is not in good agreement with our mean - field results .",
    "this raises theoretical questions associated with the fluctuations beyond mean field , and also experimental questions concerning the actual investigation of the critical scaling regime .",
    "as this work was being completed , we became aware of a work by s.sachdev , n.read and r.oppermann @xcite in which the phase diagram and crossovers described here are also analysed , and a detailed theoretical investigation of the fluctuations beyond mean - field is performed .",

    "we shall deal first with the constraint , eq.([eqscreal ] ) , which reads ( replacing @xmath76 by its square - root form near the upper band edge ) : @xmath242 the integral over @xmath243 needs to be cutoff at @xmath244 , while the integration over @xmath245 is ultra - violet convergent and its upper limit could as well be set to @xmath246 .",
    "we shall focus on the regions where @xmath247 ( which includes the qc regime and the upper part of the qd regime ) . under this assumption ,",
    "an expansion in @xmath99 can be performed to yield : @xmath248 in the integrations over @xmath245 , we set @xmath249 so that the @xmath243 dependance becomes apparent .",
    "then , we use @xmath250 and expand the integrals involving the last term at low temperature .",
    "the constraint equation then takes the form : @xmath251 in this expression , the @xmath252 s and @xmath253 s are purely numerical , positive constants ( independant of the cutoff and of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the location of the quantum critical point is readily obtained by setting @xmath254 , yielding : @xmath255 .",
    "when @xmath256 is increased above this point , the behaviour of @xmath99 in the qc regime is found by cancelling the dominant terms to next order , leading to : @xmath257 .",
    "the above expansion is valid as long as @xmath247 , so that we can also use it for @xmath258 , corresponding to the upper part of the @xmath259 region . in this case",
    ", we have to expand in @xmath260 and the behaviour @xmath261 is obtained . also , the shape of the critical boundary at low temperature is found by expanding in @xmath262 , with @xmath99 set to @xmath263 .",
    "this yields @xmath264 .",
    "next , we give some indications on the low - temperature expansion of the free - energy in the qc regime .",
    "we rewrite eq.([eqfreal ] ) for the free - energy per site @xmath265 under the form : @xmath266 in the qc regime , we should use the following scaling variables : @xmath267 .",
    "thus it is clear that @xmath99 is the smallest energy scale , and we can simply expand the above expression in powers of @xmath99 .",
    "the important point here is that _ the linear term vanishes _ because of the constraint equation above .",
    "hence , this expansion reads : @xmath268 the coefficient of the @xmath269 term is the same as found above in the analysis of the constraint .",
    "it leads to a dependence of the form @xmath270 .    in order to find the temperature dependence of the first term",
    ", we make a low frequency expansion : @xmath271 hence , this term yields a contribution of order @xmath272 to the free - energy .",
    "overall , we find the low - temperature expansion : @xmath273 in which the coefficients @xmath274 s are non - singular and non - vanishing as the critical point @xmath98 is reached .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath275 follows .",
    "finally , we comment on the behaviour of @xmath99 in the low - temperature @xmath127 regime . in this regime , the above expansions are no longer valid since they assumed @xmath125 . concentrating _",
    "e.g _ on the constraint equation , we see that the leading low - temperature correction is now controlled by the long - time behaviour @xmath276 , which holds for @xmath277 . using the poisson summation formula ,",
    "this yields : @xmath278 with @xmath279 , @xmath280 . cancelling the leading corrections ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath281 ."
