    "with the rapid experimental progress the ultracold atomic gases have offered a popular platform to investigate the strongly correlated one dimensional many - body systems @xcite for their high controllability and tunability .",
    "one dimensional quantum gases can be realized with strong anisotropic magnetic trap or two dimensional optical lattice @xcite and be described theoretically by an effective one dimensional ( 1d ) model olshanii , olshanii2,petrov , dunjko .",
    "in addition the effective 1d interaction can be tuned from the strongly attractive to the strongly repulsive interacting regime via the magnetic feshbach resonance or confinement induced resonance .",
    "not only the strongly interacting tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gases @xcite but also two counter - intuitive examples , i.e. , the repulsively bound atom pairs @xcite and the super tonks - girardeau ( stg ) gas - like phase of the attractive atomic gas haller , astrakharchik , batchelor , have been realized by a sudden quench of interaction from the strong repulsion to the strong attraction or vice versa , both of which are hard to realize in the traditional condensed matter physics and have no analog in solid state systems .",
    "it has been displayed that they are stable excited states and the stability could be understood from the quench dynamics of the 1d integrable quantum gas @xcite .",
    "so far , the stg gas has attracted intensive theoretical studies from various aspects @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of stg gases and repulsively bound atom pairs open the door to stable highly excited quantum many - body phases .",
    "this also offers us a method to search for exotic quantum phases in 1d many - body systems .",
    "it has been predicted that such stable excited states can be prepared in optical lattice via sudden quantum quench @xcite and the effective super tonks - girardeau gases can be realized via strongly attractive one - dimensional fermi gases @xcite .",
    "theoretically the strongly interacting bose gases can not be well described in the mean - field theory due to the large quantum fluctuation in 1d system and one has to resort to non - perturbation methods .",
    "many methods such as bethe ansatz dunjko , fuchs , hao , guan , bosonization method @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , bose - fermi mapping method ( bfm ) @xcite and multi - configuration hartree theory @xcite were used to investigate the 1d quantum gases .",
    "it was shown that with the increase in repulsion strength the ground state density distribution of 1d bose gases continuously evolves from a gaussian - like distribution to a multi - peak structure while the momentum distribution remains the single peak structure of bosonic atoms @xcite .    by a sudden quench of interaction from strong repulsion to strong attraction",
    "a tg gas shall transfer into a stg gas @xcite . because the quantum gas is very weakly coupled with",
    "the environment its energy dissipation is ignorable and this highly excited state shall be stable .",
    "by decreasing the attractive interaction of stg gas we can investigate the properties of the lowest scattering state for the bose gas with the change of attractive interaction from strongly to weakly interacting regime . in this work , by numerically solving the bethe ansatz equation we obtain exact wave function of the lowest scattering state of 1d bose gas trapped in a hard wall potential in the above interacting regime .",
    "we will focus on the density distribution , reduced one body density matrix ( robdm ) and two body correlation in the full attractive interaction regime .",

    "it deserves to notice that for all attractively interacting strengthes there exists a strong enhancement of the diagonal contribution @xmath86 along the line @xmath87 . in the limit of strong attraction",
    ", the system displays the same behavior as tg gases that @xmath88 reduces rapidly as @xmath89 increases . for weaker attraction",
    "the off - diagonal part of robdm shall increase gradually and we have approximately @xmath90 when the attraction is weak enough .",
    "the density distributions of the lowest scattering state for different attractive interacting strength are displayed in fig .",
    "4 . in the strongly attractive limit",
    ", it is shown that the density profile of the stg gas of @xmath0 atoms exhibits the fermi - like shell structure of @xmath0-peak similar to the density profile of the tg gas .",
    "this is due to the fact that the stg state in the limit of @xmath91 and the tg state in the limit of @xmath92 are actually identical .",
    "as the attraction decreases , the density distribution deviates the fermi - like distribution and the shell structure oscillates more and more dramatically . in the limit of @xmath36 approaching @xmath93 there appear @xmath94 peaks in the density profile .",

    "5 . for strong attractive interaction ,",
    "the atoms accumulate in the central regime close to zero momentum and the population distributions decrease rapidly for large momentum , which reflects the statistics of bosonic atoms . with the decrease of attraction",
    "the atoms distribute more extensively in higher momentum region and in the strong but finite attractive interaction ( e.g. @xmath95 ) the atoms distribute widely in the momentum space without an obvious zero - momentum peak . for even weaker attractive",
    "interaction , the probability of atoms locating at the zero momentum increases and the momentum distribution develops a prominent peak at zero point @xmath96 . away from the central peak , the momentum distribution starts to display shell structure , which however exhibits distinct feature from the momentum distribution of fermi gas .",
    "it is because the lowest scattering state is an excited state that the bose atoms populate in higher momentum region .",
    "( from the left above to the right below).,width=302,height=302 ]    it is also interesting to study the two body correlation function defined as @xmath97 which denotes the probability that one measurement will find an atom at the point @xmath98 and the other one at the point @xmath99 . in fig . 6 we display the two body correlation of lowest scattering state for the bose gas with @xmath100 .",
    "it turns out that two atoms with strong attractive interaction would try to avoid each other and try to keep away from each other in certain distance , while as the decrease in attraction the probability of finding two atoms in the adjacent region increase and arrive at the maximum as @xmath101 .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the lowest scattering state of bose gas in the full attractive interacting regime with bethe ansatz method . by solving the bethe ansatz equations numerically the exact wave functions of the lowest scattering state",
    "were determined .",
    "based on the wave function we obtain the robdm , density profile , momentum distribution and two - body correlation . it is shown that in the stg limit the robdm of the lowest scattering state exhibit the same behavior as tg gas . with the decrease of attractive interaction the density distribution evolves from a @xmath0-peak shell structure to a @xmath102-peak one and",
    "bose atoms are located at the center of the trap with the most probability .",
    "the momentum distribution manifests the nature of bose statistics in the stg limit with an obvious zero - momentum peak . when the attraction keeps on deviating the stg limit the momentum distribution spreads more widely although the most probable position at which the atoms populate is still near the region of zero momentum .",
