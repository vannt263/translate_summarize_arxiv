    "in this paper we construct examples of periodic minimal surfaces in some semidirect products @xmath2 depending on the matrix @xmath3 by periodic surface we mean a properly embedded surface invariant by a nontrivial discrete group of isometries .",
    "one of the most simple examples of semidirect product is @xmath4 when we take @xmath5 in this space , mazet , rodr ' iguez and rosenberg @xcite proved some results about periodic constant mean curvature surfaces and they constructed examples of such surfaces .",
    "one of their methods is to solve a plateau problem for a certain contour . in @xcite , using a similar technique , rosenberg constructed examples of complete minimal surfaces in @xmath6 where @xmath7 is either the two - sphere or a complete riemannian surface with nonnegative curvature or the hyperbolic plane .",
    "meeks , mira , p ' erez and ros @xcite have proved results concerning the geometry of solutions to plateau type problems in metric semidirect products @xmath2 when there is some geometric constraint on the boundary values of the solution ( see theorem [ th - mmpr ] ) .",
    "the first example that we construct is a complete periodic minimal surface similar to the doubly periodic scherk minimal surface in @xmath8 .",
    "it is invariant by two translations that commute and is a four punctured sphere in the quotient of @xmath9 by the group of isometries generated by the two translations . in the last section",
    "we obtain a complete periodic minimal surface analogous to the singly periodic scherk minimal surface in @xmath0    these surfaces are obtained by solving the plateau problem for a geodesic polygonal contour @xmath10 ( it uses a result by meeks , mira , prez and ros @xcite about the geometry of solutions to the plateau problem in semidirect products ) , and letting some sides of @xmath10 tend to infinity in length , so that the associated plateau solutions all pass through a fixed compact region ( this will be assured by the existence of minimal annuli playing the role of barriers ) .",
    "then a subsequence of the plateau solutions will converge to a minimal surface bounded by a geodesic polygon with edges of infinite length .",
    "we complete this surface by symmetry across the edges .",
    "the whole construction requires precise geometric control and uses curvature estimates for stable minimal surfaces .",
    "these results are obtained for semidirect products @xmath9 where @xmath11 for example , we obtain periodic minimal surfaces in the heisenberg space , when @xmath12 and in sol@xmath13 when @xmath14 with their well known riemannian metrics . when we consider the one - parameter family of matrices @xmath15 we get a one - parameter family of metrics in sol@xmath1 which are not isometric .",

    ". therefore , we will have necessarily a closed curve contained in the intersection .",
    "as @xmath143 is simply connected this curve bounds a disk in @xmath383 but as the parallel planes to @xmath373 are minimal surfaces , we can use the maximum principle to prove that this disk is contained in the plane @xmath373 and then they coincide , which is impossible .",
    "thus , the vector @xmath288 is transversal to @xmath88 at points @xmath384    observe that , besides the interior points , the surfaces @xmath143 are also transversal to @xmath288 at the points in @xmath385 and @xmath386 by the maximum principle with boundary .",
    "thus rotation by angle @xmath48 around @xmath385 ( respectively @xmath387 ) gives a minimal surface which is also transversal to the killing field @xmath288 in the interior , extends the surface @xmath143 and has @xmath388 ( respectively @xmath389 ) in the interior .",
    "therefore , we have uniform curvature estimates for @xmath143 up to @xmath390    hence , for every compact contained in @xmath230 there exists a subsequence of @xmath143 that converges to a minimal surface . taking an exhaustion by compact sets and using a diagonal process , we conclude that there exists a subsequence of @xmath143 that converges to a minimal surface @xmath88 that has @xmath391 in its boundary .",
    "from now on we will use the notation @xmath143 for this subsequence .",
    "it remains to prove that in fact @xmath88 is a minimal surface with boundary @xmath232 in order to do that , we will use the fact that each @xmath143 is a vertical graph in the interior .",
    "let us denote by @xmath233 the function defined in int@xmath392 such that @xmath393 where @xmath394      recall that each @xmath143 is the limit of a sequence of minimal graphs @xmath397 whose boundary is transversal to the killing field @xmath398 using the flow of the killing field @xmath245 we can prove that each @xmath399 is above @xmath400 and then the limit surface @xmath143 has to be above @xmath401 in fact , @xmath143 is strictly above @xmath402 in the interior , because as @xmath143 and @xmath402 are minimal surfaces , if they intersect at an interior point , there will be points of @xmath143 under @xmath400 and we already know that , by the property of @xmath403 this is not possible .",
    "we will use the same idea as in claim [ claim1 ] . for @xmath405 and",
    "@xmath240 consider the vertical strip bounded by @xmath406 @xmath407 @xmath408 and @xmath409 this is a minimal surface transversal to the killing field @xmath410 hence any small perturbation of its boundary gives a minimal surface with that perturbed boundary .",
    "thus , if we consider a small perturbation of the boundary of this vertical strip by just perturbing a little bit @xmath246 by a curve contained in @xmath411 joining the points @xmath412 and @xmath413 we will get a minimal surface @xmath125 with this perturbed boundary .",
    "this minimal surface @xmath125 will have the property that the tangent planes at the interior points of @xmath250 are not vertical , by the maximum principle with boundary .    applying translations along the @xmath62-axis and @xmath59-axis",
    ", we can use the translates of @xmath125 to show that @xmath143 is under @xmath125 in a neighborhood of @xmath218 and then we have uniform gradient estimates for points in @xmath221 .",
    "analogously , constructing similar barriers , we can prove that we have uniform gradient estimates in a neighborhood of @xmath414      we have that @xmath143 is a monotone increasing sequence of minimal graphs with uniform gradient estimates in @xmath415 and it is a bounded graph for points in @xmath416 ( because of the barrier given by the annulus @xmath198 ) .",
    "therefore , there exists a subsequence of @xmath143 that converges to a minimal surface @xmath257 with @xmath417 in its boundary . as we already know that @xmath143 converges to the minimal surface @xmath259",
    "we conclude that in fact @xmath260 and then @xmath88 is a minimal surface with @xmath418 in its boundary .",
    "notice that we can assume that @xmath88 has @xmath262 as its boundary , with @xmath88 being of class @xmath263 up to @xmath419 and continuous up to @xmath232 the expected `` singly periodic scherk minimal surface '' is obtained by rotating recursively @xmath88 by an angle @xmath48 about the vertical and horizontal geodesics in its boundary .      1 j. jost .",
