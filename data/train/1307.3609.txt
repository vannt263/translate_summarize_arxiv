    "to measure the length variation of dispersed lnts in the same suspension as that used for film fabrication , we applied a high - frequency ac electric field using the following method that has been developed in ref . [ 33 ] .",
    "an ac field of 0.2 kv / cm at a frequency of 4 mhz was applied to a 30-@xmath0l aliquot via two vertical pairs of aluminium electrodes placed on a cover slip .",
    "we stained the lnts with the fluorescence dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( dapi ) to visualise the individual components in sharp contrast .",
    "the orientation of the lnts can be switched orthogonally by a change in the active electrode pair , while dielectrophoretic assembly at 4 mhz hardly occurs , as inferred from supplementary figure s6(b ) .",
    "it was observed that a considerable number of lnts responsive to the ac electric field individually and simultaneously rotated from alignment to the vertical .",
    "we verified the linear increase in rotation angle with time .",
    "hence , the angular velocity @xmath50 was evaluated from the slope of the rotation angle versus time , where @xmath51 , using a required time @xmath52 to rotate through an angle of @xmath53 radians .",
    "considering the balance equation between the exerted torque and the hydrodynamic force caused by water viscosity , it is found that @xmath50 noticeably decreases as @xmath54 , where @xmath17 denotes the length of the major axis of a lnt mimicked by a prolate spheroid . because @xmath50 is a sensitive indicator of @xmath17",
    ", we obtained the length distribution based on the previous procedure , which is displayed as a histogram in supplementary figure s1 .",
    "the histogram profile has one maximum and a tail in the longer - length region , and the mean length is approximately 6.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "though there exists a small portion of lnts with lengths longer than 10 @xmath0 m ( see supplementary figure s1 ) , the 10-@xmath0 m electrode gap and the off - chip position of the electrodes result in the exclusion of the long sedimentary lnts and of random bundles from the constituents of the lnt array film .",
    "[ [ assembly - processes - of - carboxylate - modified - polystyrene - cm - ps - spheres ] ] 2 .",
    "assembly processes of carboxylate - modified polystyrene ( cm - ps ) spheres ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    here , we describe extra data on the assembly processes of spherical colloids , cm - ps particles given in supplementary figures s2 to s4 .",
    "first , we look at the evolution of the total number @xmath19 in supplementary figure s2(a ) , indicating that @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath20 , irrespective of the electric field strength .",
    "the straight lines fitted to the data in supplementary figure s2(a ) provide the slopes , which we have designated as the assembly number rate per second : @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting @xmath30-dependence of @xmath29 has been shown in figure 4(b ) . from supplementary figure s6(a ) , on the other hand , we can see that @xmath29 is a decreasing function of @xmath44 in the range @xmath55 while maintaining the strength @xmath56 kv / cm .",
    "we also measured the evolution of the occupied area covering both the inside and outside of the rectangular region .",
    "supplementary figure s2(b ) shows that @xmath33 increases and crosses 100 @xmath37 at @xmath38 , when the rectangular area is filled with colloidal particles prior to reaching @xmath57 . from supplementary figure s2(a ) , it is found that the total numbers at @xmath38 are identical , independent of @xmath30 : @xmath58 for all of the different field strength magnitudes ; the constancy of @xmath39 means that the layer number and the accumulation degree are invariant with respect to @xmath30 at @xmath38 due to a uniform spread of collected particles in the plug - in system . because @xmath29 reads that @xmath40 , the constancy of @xmath39 means that the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath42 accords with that of @xmath29 .",
    "supplementary figure s3 demonstrates a time series of optical micrographs , representing the assembly process of spherical colloids , cm - ps particles .",
    "the optical micrograph on the leftmost side of supplementary figure s3 shows that colloids start to accumulate around the pointed electrode heads due to dielectrophoresis toward the needle tips , where the electric field gradient is obviously the largest .",
    "the sequential images in supplementary figure s3 indicate that the colloidal clusters around both heads are pumped from both sides into the inside of the rectangular region as marked in figure 1(b ) .",
    "lastly , supplementary figure s4 provides the height effect on the assembly courses in terms of @xmath29 .",
    "the height @xmath59 is determined by the contact position as follows : lifting the parallel electrodes off the substrate at an arbitrary height , the needles were gradually lowered until they reached the bottom , where the electrodes were in contact with the cover slip . then , we can measure @xmath48 by vertically controlling the electrode position using the micromanipulators .",
    "the maximum height @xmath60 is close to the air - water interface , determined by the contact angle of a water droplet on the substrate where supplementary figure s4 quantifies the @xmath48-dependence of @xmath29 for @xmath56 kv / cm and @xmath47 khz .",
    "comparison between the optical micrographs on the right side of supplementary figure s4 also indicates that the assembly degree of colloidal arrays is reduced as the height @xmath48 from the substrate in an assembly is decreased . at @xmath59",
    ", we observed that a solvent flow , such as electro - osmosis , in the vicinity of the glass substrate hinders the stable trapping of spherical colloids .",
    "we have adjusted the relative length of the electrode gap compared with the lnt length to create uniform films of parallel lnt arrays , or nanocapillary films .",
    "the gap length can reach a minimum width of 6-@xmath0 m , equal to the mean lnt length where , theoretically , the channel configuration appears to be optimised ; however , we set the width to be 10 @xmath0 m , longer than 6 @xmath0 m , to avoid dielectrophoretic jamming around the electrode tips .",
    "consequently , the electric moulding has produced homogeneous lnt films , and the uniform assembly of lnts validates the constancy of @xmath39 that has been assumed in corroborating the result of supplementary figure s5(a ) as follows .",
    "supplementary figure s5(a ) shows four plots of @xmath33 for the field strengths @xmath61 at @xmath62 khz . from supplementary figure s5(a ) as well as supplementary figure s2(b ) , we can see that the fraction @xmath33 rises faster as @xmath30 increases ; so @xmath38 decreases with an increase in @xmath30 .",
    "instead of counting individual lnts , @xmath42 can clarify the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath29 assuming that @xmath39 is independent of @xmath30 , similar to the case of cm - ps particles .",
    "figure 4(d ) displays the log - log plot of @xmath42 versus @xmath30 , where the experimental results are found to satisfy the relation @xmath43 , which is represented by the straight line .",
    "so , the reference rate @xmath42 for lnts holds the dielectrophoretic property as that for cm - ps particles does , thereby validating that in both cm - ps and lnt suspensions @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , we clarified the frequency dependence of the total assembly degree for lnts using the averaged grey - scale over the rectangular area because there are some cases where @xmath38 is not directly related to @xmath29 , such as the following : at the higher frequencies of 500 khz and 700 khz , we observed that the accumulation of lnts started after applying an external field for minutes ( see supplementary fig .",
    "s5(b ) ) , indicating that @xmath64 is violated . hence ,",
    "the assembly courses of lnts were assessed not by the occupied - area fraction @xmath33 , but by the normalised mean darkness @xmath65 that measures transmitted light through the assembly films , where @xmath65 has been obtained from the average of the grey - scale over the rectangular region , which was normalised to satisfy @xmath66 for black objects . in figure s6(b ) , the total degree of gathering lnts is expressed by @xmath67 at a reference time @xmath68 when @xmath69 kv / cm . from figure s6(b ) , it is found that @xmath67 decreases sharply with an increase in @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 , which is quite analogous to the @xmath44-dependence of @xmath29 for cm - ps particles in supplementary figure s6(a ) .",
    "let @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 be the spherical volume of a cm - ps particle , the volume fraction of an electrical assembly , and the mean height of an electrical box , respectively .",
    "the volume fraction @xmath73 as a function of the duration time @xmath20 is defined as @xmath74 while we observed a hexagonal order in the first layer ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , the electrode needles can not maintain the 3d crystalline order , and it is plausible to assume that @xmath71 reaches a maximum @xmath75 at a random close packing .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ fraction ] ) implies the inequality , with respect to @xmath72 , @xmath76 when we use @xmath77 , the value of hard spheres in the literature ( e.g. , see ref . [ 51 ] ) , and when we calculate the volume @xmath70 using @xmath78 and a spherical radius @xmath79 , the mean height @xmath26 at the minimum is @xmath80 at completing the first layer .",
    "the terminal height is given by @xmath81 using the maximum total number @xmath22 . while the former height ( [ first - layer ] ) is comparable to the 3 @xmath0 m diameter of the spheres present , the latter ( [ complete - height ] ) is consistent with the thickness of lnt films .",
    "as explained in the literature ( e.g. see refs . [ 50 ] and [ 52 ] ) , dielectrophoresis of colloidal particles is distinguished from electrophoresis by the following features .",
    "first , dielectrophoresis is caused by the gradient of dc or ac electric field , in contrast with electrophoresis , which occurs even under a uniform field . moreover , while only charged objects undergo electrophoresis , any polarisable object , charged or neutral , experiences the dielectrophoretic force @xmath82 given by @xmath83\\left|\\nabla e\\right|^2,\\\\     \\mathrm{re}[k^*(2\\pi f)]&=&\\frac{\\epsilon^*_p(f)-\\epsilon^*_m(f)}{\\epsilon^*_p(f)+2\\epsilon^*_m(f)}.\\label{cm }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath84 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath85 is the complex dielectric constant of the solvent at an applied frequency @xmath44 , @xmath86 is the dc component of @xmath85 , @xmath87 is the complex dielectric constant of a colloid at @xmath44 , @xmath88 is the radius of a spherical colloid , @xmath30 is the root mean square magnitude of the electric field , and @xmath89 $ ] corresponds to the real part of the clausius - mossotti ( cm ) factor as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting dielectrophoresis produces a hydrodynamic force exerted in the opposite direction of the dielectrophoretic velocity @xmath90 .",
    "the balance equation between the dielectrophoretic and hydrodynamic forces gives @xmath91 where the right - hand side of the equation arises from the stokes - einstein relation with @xmath92 denoting the water viscosity .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ cm ] ) and ( [ se ] ) , we have @xmath93\\left|\\nabla e\\right|^2 .     \\label{v - dep}\\ ] ] because the absolute value of the electric field gradient is supposed to be proportional to the electric field magnitude @xmath30 , neglecting any non - linear effects , eq .",
    "( [ v - dep ] ) indicates that @xmath90 is proportional to both @xmath94 and to the real part of the cm factor .",
    "we relate the total assembly number @xmath19 of colloids to the dielectrophoretic velocity @xmath90 using the following conservation law : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the positionally dependent colloid concentration and @xmath97 represents a velocity vector at position @xmath98 . integrating both sides of eq .",

    "<S> 1(a ) ) , which is similar to the ideal state of semiconducting carbon nanotubes in creating a thin film transistor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this bridging can be accomplished by excluding serial arrays of lnts from the oriented assembly . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) last , a genuine assembly with an unaltered native outer surface is vital to the straightforward scale - up of a pilot study on a single lnt , a nano - platform for reacting and transporting encapsulated objects .      </S>",
    "<S> * off - chip assembly for creating nanofluidic devices*. in order to fabricate a flexible nanofluidic device of lnts fulfilling the aforementioned requirements , we exploited an ac electric field to direct the organisation of nanoparticles @xcite . while previous studies on the electric assembly of colloidal spheres have demonstrated that ac fields applied via on - chip electrodes precisely control the 3d and 2d crystalline orientations as well as the colloidal concentrations @xcite , on - chip assembly systems have problems arising from the electrodes being fixed on a substrate . because the electrode configuration can not be changed , on - chip systems are irrelevant to electrode removal from a colloidal assembly without the use of a binder . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , on - chip processes depend on the wettability of the substrates and limit the substrates that can be used for applications .    </S>",
    "<S> to overcome these problems , we adopt the off - chip assembly system that plugs into a sample drop a pair of electrode needles above a cover slip ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rectangle delineated in figure 1(b ) corresponds to an off - chip potential valley created by the needle pair . </S>",
    "<S> because the plug - in electrodes are independently controlled by two sets of patch clamp micromanipulators , the off - chip system facilitates to adjust the electrode gap so that serial nanocapillary alignments may be excluded , thereby creating an lnt film of parallel nanocapillary arrays ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) . moreover , the off - chip style has advantages of avoiding both impurity deposition and drying - induced adhesion to either the electrodes or the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we are able not only to control the assembly size , but also to remove an assembly from the needles , which yields a separated genuine assembly of an appropriate size </S>",
    "<S> . we can see the assembly and drying sequences for the lnt suspension in supplementary movies 1 and 2 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the lnt length distribution has been efficiently determined using in situ measurements of the rotational dynamics in the lnt suspension ( see supplementary discussion for the details ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the histogram in supplementary figure s1 shows that the majority of the lengths are between four and six microns ; the mean length is calculated to be approximately @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also to be noted that the off - chip assembly was performed in a filtered dispersion where shorter lnts had passed away through a 5-@xmath4 plastic filter ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , an electrode gap less than @xmath5 can considerably diminish the number of serial - parallel arrays , the alignment of two or more lnts along the external electric field , so that we can obtain an lnt film whose majority is formed by parallel nanocapillaries . </S>",
    "<S> in what follows , we demonstrate that this off - chip technique using plug - in electrodes allows one - step fabrication of biocompatible nanofluidic devices solely using lnts , which will be referred to as `` _ electric moulding _ '' .    </S>",
    "<S> * electric moulding into birefringent lnt films*. figure 2(a ) exhibits three typical images of lnt films . </S>",
    "<S> a digital microscope image on the upside shows a spontaneously dried film on a cover glass , a substrate used in separating lnt assembly from manipulated electrodes ( the last procedure of electric moulding ) . while the lnt film in the upper image , which leaves moist , has a 20-@xmath0 m width and 70-@xmath0 m length in accordance with the electrode configuration , it is possible to change the size of the electrically focused area into 10-@xmath4 in gap length which satisfies the aforementioned requirement of parallel lnt arrays . </S>",
    "<S> the lower images in figure 2(a ) represent the narrower lnt films having 10-@xmath4 width . </S>",
    "<S> these films are placed on a grid substrate to perform in situ observations using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) as shown in the lower right image , and the metallic substrate can be seen through a transparent lnt film in the digital microscope image on the lower left side .        </S>",
    "<S> electrode removal does not always succeed , and the left micrograph in figure 2(b ) demonstrates a typical tearing situation during the separation process from the electrodes ; one of the methodological refinements for reducing incomplete removal would be to improve the electrode surface using chemical modification . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the left image suggests that each individual lnt is perpendicular to the surface of electrode needles , which has been verified by the middle sem image in figure 2(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sem image focuses on an edge parallel to the electrode surface , showing the alignment of lnts . </S>",
    "<S> the polarised optical micrograph on the rightmost side of figure 2(b ) also demonstrates the birefringent property of lnt films placed on the sem grid . </S>",
    "<S> the film brightness measured in the polarised micrograph varies when the stage is rotated . </S>",
    "<S> image analysis provides the intensity of the transmitted light , normalised by the maximum , which is then averaged over the regions of these films to obtain a mean brightness @xmath6 as a function of the rotation angle @xmath7 of the stage ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting result is given by @xmath8 with a set of optimized parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , quantifying the anisotropic optical property common to liquid crystalline materials .    </S>",
    "<S> * size - selective inclusion of gnps into lnt films*. the birefringent film of aligned lnts is expected to selectively and efficiently capture aqueous nanoparticles by capillary action , when the target film is dried in a vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate below that the lnt films fabricated by our electric moulding technique hold this capability of individual lnts , using both the digital microscopy and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the fret solely occurs from the internal fluorescent molecules of rhodamine 6 g ( r6 g ) to gnps encapsulated in the inner space of lnts because the thickness of the lnt membrane wall is approximately 80 nm and is large enough to prevent fret through the wall @xcite ; therefore , the fret is relevant to the detection of nanoparticle encapsulation inside the lnts .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of 5-nm gnps provides the digital microscope images of figure 3(a ) where we observed that the lnt films were kept metallic after rinsing gnps repeatedly , which is similar to the micrographic look of metallic grid in figure 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the addition of r6 g molecules mostly exhibits no fluorescence due to the fret , or the disappearance of the fluorescence band , and a fluorescence micrograph on the right side of figure 3(a ) selects an incomplete film that is somehow recognizable due to a partially fluorescent part where the lack of gnps results in the irrelevance of the fret . as seen from the digital microscopy image of figure 3(b ) , on the other hand , an lnt film mixed with 40-nm gnps exhibits a normal surface indistinguishable from that of a genuine lnt film , which conforms with a fluorescent brightness highlighting the outline in the fluorescence micrograph on the right side of figure 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the entire absence of fret in adding 40-nm gnps offers some explanations as follows : while most of 40-nm gnps are excluded from the hollow channels of lnts having its inner diameter of @xmath13 nm , the saline rinses serve to eliminate gnps coated through vacuum drying and the fret on the surface is negligible even if the covered gnps are left to some extent .    </S>",
    "<S> the contrasted results of figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) are interpreted by the size - selectivity of lnt films ; however , it remains to be proved that the fret in lnt films actually requires the 10-@xmath0 m width , though the relation , @xmath14 , should reduce serial arrays of lnts in comparison with a wider film such that @xmath15 . for making the ambiguity clear , we controlled another type of lnt film that was mixed with the identical 5-nm gnps but was extended to 30 @xmath0 m in width ( see the middle micrograph in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) ) ; the 5-nm gnps could be inserted into lnt films irrespectively of the width , if the fret mainly occurs due to unwrapped gnps such as those existing in the interstices among lnts . as shown in the left micrograph of figure 3(c ) , the threefold width provides fluorescent films to the contrary . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is found from comparing fluorescent micrographs in figures 3(a ) to 3(c ) that the fluorescent area in this 30-@xmath0 m film of figure 3(c ) does not cover a whole rectangle with its edge being obscure . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the fret seems to be relevant on edges of a 30-@xmath0 m film , which is consistent with a magnified view of this film in figure 3(c ) on the rightmost side where a metallic deposition of 5-nm gnps is observed on the bordered region .    </S>",
    "<S> these results of figure 3(c ) imply the other significant factor of adjusting the width , which is schematically illustrated by figure 3(d ) : the inner capacity of parallel lnts is efficiently and homogeneously filled with 5-nm gnps when the electrode gap length @xmath16 , adjusted close to the mean lnt length @xmath17 , creates a flat section as shown in the left diagram in figure 3(d ) . for irregular ends , on the other hand , the inflow of 5-nm gnps seems to be blocked out on the entrance region of open ends ( see the right schematic in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) ) , which explains the jamming of gnps on film edges as shown in figure 3(c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * a comparative study of the assembly courses*. we need to validate that the off - chip assembly is mainly driven by dielectrophoresis for systematically searching an optimum set of electric parameters , such as the strength and frequency of the applied electric fields . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we first investigate the assembly processes of carboxylate - modified polystyrene ( cm - ps ) spheres with their diameter of 3 @xmath0 m , instead of lnts . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure 4(a ) , the off - chip assembly of 3-@xmath0 m spheres produces a hexagonal packing with two - dimensional crystalline order , as do the on - chip techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the external field is applied at @xmath18 via the electrode pair , the 3-@xmath0 m particles are attracted into the rectangular area , as depicted in figure 1(b ) , and simultaneously we started to count the total number @xmath19 of collected particles existing at a duration time @xmath20 in the rectangular region formed by the electrode pair , which has a 30-@xmath0 m gap and a 90-@xmath0 m width . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , we have set the maximum total number in supplementary figure s2(a ) to be less than @xmath21 because more electrically attracted colloids are localised around the electrode tips outside the rectangular region . as evaluated in supplementary discussion , @xmath22 is equal to that for randomly close packed spheres @xcite in the box of an electric holder having a minimum volume @xmath23 , with a prescribed rectangular area @xmath24 and a lower bound of mean height @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the former area is calculated from the aforementioned electrode configuration , whereas the latter height @xmath26 reasonably explains the mean thicknesses of lnt films of several microns , which have been determined using the adjustment of the sem focus when observing dry lnt films .    as shown in supplementary figure s2(a ) , the collected number , @xmath19 , as a function of the duration time @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath20 irrespective of the electric field strength in the range @xmath27 , and therefore the global slope of @xmath19 uniquely determines the assembly number rate , @xmath28 , per second . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(b ) is a log - log plot of @xmath29 versus the field strength @xmath30 at @xmath31 , indicating that @xmath32 similarly to that of the dielectrophoretic velocity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in supplementary discussion , the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath29 proves the dielectrophoretic mechanism of the colloidal assembly in the plug - in system .    </S>",
    "<S> however , turning our attention to the lnts , we find it hard to count individual lnts , so an alternative parameter to @xmath19 needs to be explored . </S>",
    "<S> we then adopted the percentage fraction @xmath33 of the cross - sectional area occupied by either cm - ps particles or electrically collected lnts , where @xmath33 is defined , using the relation @xmath34 , as the ratio of the measured area @xmath35 to the maximum of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> tracing the evolution of an occupied area that covers both the inside and outside of the rectangular region , @xmath33 increases to and crosses 100 @xmath37 at @xmath38 when colloidal particles with their number of @xmath39 complete to fill the rectangular area prior to reaching the maximum state of @xmath22 ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2(b ) ) , and we have found that @xmath39 of cm - ps particles is independent of @xmath30 as described in supplementary discussion . because @xmath29 is given by @xmath40 using an invariant number of @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that the inverse of @xmath38 obeys the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(c ) actually demonstrates that @xmath41 for cm - ps particles in accord with the relation of @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> we then measured @xmath33 using the optical micrographs to evaluate @xmath38 of lnts ( supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s5(a ) ) . figure 4(d ) displays the log - log plot of @xmath42 versus @xmath30 , where the experimental results satisfy the relation @xmath43 as well as that for cm - ps particles . from supplementary figure s6 </S>",
    "<S> , it is also found that the assembly degrees of cm - ps particles and lnts are similarly reduced with an increase in @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 , which corresponds to a typical @xmath44-dependence of dielectrophoresis @xcite . combining these consistent dependencies of the assembly courses of cm - ps particles and lnts on @xmath30 and @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that dielectrophoresis causes the off - chip assembly of lnts and of colloidal spheres . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we fabricated the dry lnt films shown in figures 2 and 3 using the electric parameters @xmath46 kv / cm and @xmath47 khz , which have been optimised in terms of both the efficiency and robustness of the dielectrophoretic assembly .    </S>",
    "<S> the last parameter to be adjusted is the height @xmath48 from the substrate of the off - chip assembly in adopting an optimum set of @xmath46 kv / cm and @xmath47 khz . as described in supplementary discussion using the results of supplementary figure s4 , we chose @xmath49 for the fabrication of lnts as a trade - off , considering the successful drying versus an efficient assembly or a sound removal of the electric mould .      </S>",
    "<S> to summarise , the off - chip assembly method using plug - in electrodes has three properties : size adjustability of the potential valley , colloidal arrays lifted above the substrate , and electrode needles with tapered shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the first two advantages of this technique have been described in detail , and we add another benefit associated with the last feature below . </S>",
    "<S> the electrode tips produce the largest field gradient around them , thereby inducing colloidal dielectrophoresis mainly directed toward their pointed heads . </S>",
    "<S> when we place the needle tips of twin absorbers on opposite sides as shown in figure 1(b ) , colloidal flows are generated from the outside to the inside across both sides of the rectangular edges vertical to the electrodes ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 ) . from the symmetrical pathways </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that gathering particles will meet in the middle region of the potential valley . </S>",
    "<S> similar flows during plug - in assembly of lnts work to exclude voided assembly films caused by bottlenecks during the initial stage .    </S>",
    "<S> final remarks are made on the potentials as nano - assay or nanoreactor devices . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the reconfigurability , the off - chip assembly method is capable of providing a high - throughput nanofluidic device of lnts that efficiently transports and reacts confined particles inside an lnt and that multiplies either the signalling or product of each lnt . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the scalability of an lnt film to a macroscopic length opens up the possibility for creating a variety of flexible nanofluidic devices that make chemical or biological reactions visible .      </S>",
    "<S> * materials*. the lipid nanotubes ( lnts ) used were derived from self - assembly in a glycolipid solution following a typical procedure , as described previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inner diameters were @xmath13 nm , while the wall thicknesses were approximately 80 nm . </S>",
    "<S> because we set the electrode gap to 10 @xmath0 m , the number of lnts shorter than 5 @xmath0 m , which are unfavourable particles , as described in the text ( see also figure 1(c ) ) , needs to be diminished . </S>",
    "<S> the following recipe was therefore adopted to prepare the lnt solution . </S>",
    "<S> we first dissolved lnts in deionised water to obtain a 0.1-wt.@xmath37 dispersion , which was subsequently filtered through a 5-@xmath4 plastic filter ( 17594k , sartorius ) . </S>",
    "<S> deionised water , 3-ml , was carefully added to the filter to redissolve the lnts remaining on the filter . </S>",
    "<S> a 20-@xmath0l aliquot of the filtered suspension was dropped onto a cover slip for electric assembly , yielding naturally dried lnt films .    </S>",
    "<S> the prepared lnt assembly was further dried in a vacuum to enhance the capillary action to fill the inner space of the lnts with 5-nm gnps . </S>",
    "<S> we induced capillary action by dropping a 20-@xmath0l aliquot of a 0.1-wt.@xmath37 gnp solution with 5-nm diameters ( wako ) onto a dried lnt film . </S>",
    "<S> once again , we performed vacuum drying on the gnp - added films , which had subsequently been rinsed with an excess amount of 20-wt.@xmath37 saline to remove gnps from the outer surfaces of the lnts . to observe the fret , we added a 0.1-mm solution of rhodamine 6 g ( r6 g , wako ) molecules to the film with encapsulated 5-nm gnps . </S>",
    "<S> as a control experiment , we also used a 0.1-wt.@xmath37 solution of gnps having a larger diameter of 40 nm ( wako ) .    for a reference study of the electric assembly process , we investigated the gathering courses of carboxylate - modified polystyrene ( cm - ps ) particles 3-@xmath0 m in diameter ( dainichi - seika ) in a 100-@xmath0l aliquot of a 0.1 wt.@xmath37 suspension .    . </S>",
    "<S> we mounted an aliquot on an inverted fluorescence microscope ( nikon , te2000-u ) , into which a pair of tungsten microelectrodes with tip diameters of 1@xmath0 m was inserted . </S>",
    "<S> an external electric field having a sinusoidal wave was applied between the electrode pair using an arbitrary waveform generator ( agilent , 33220a ) and a current amplifier ( flc electronics , f30pv ) , and the microscopy images and movies were obtained using a ccd camera ( q - imaging , retiga exi ) . </S>",
    "<S> we performed video analysis using image analysis software ( imagej ) . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the electrode needles are independently controlled using two sets of patch - clamp micromanipulators ( narisige , nmn-21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> observations of prepared lnt films were also made using a digital microscope ( omron , vc7700 ) , a polarised microscope ( olympus , bx51 ) , and a field emission scanning electron microscope ( jeol , jsm-7300f ) at 3 kv . </S>"
