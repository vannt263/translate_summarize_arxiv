    "there is considerable interest in estimating age and transit times of elements in a physical system or , equivalently , of individuals in a population , in disciplines as diverse as population dynamics and demography @xcite , chemical engineering @xcite , and hydrology and geophysics ( e.g. , among many others @xcite ) .",
    "it has in fact become increasingly clear that the age , survival time , and the total time spent by each element in a system may provide additional key insights into specific aspects of a system s behavior .",
    "this viewpoint , which can be considered as a time - integrated lagrangian perspective , has been especially emphasized in groundwater systems @xcite and in the hydrological response of watersheds @xcite , using both theoretical @xcite and field approaches @xcite .",
    "recent discussions in the literature about the role of internal variability and external forcing ( e.g. , rainfall ) on the properties of age distributions @xcite , as well as the differences between age and survival time distributions , their degree of statistical dependence , and their symmetry under time reversal ( e.g. , @xcite ) have made evident that a comprehensive theory of age and related concepts is still missing . toward this goal , in this contribution we focus on the linkage between age and survival time distribution in both transient and steady - state conditions . differently from what was assumed in @xcite",
    ", we show that age and survival time are in general statistically dependent quantities ( the only case of independence being the one of time- and age - independent loss ( or input ) in steady state ) .",
    "the theoretical framework afforded by the evolution equation of the joint distributions of age and survival also provides a means to easily understand the time symmetries between age and survival , and the derivation of the general properties of the transit - time distribution .",
    "we should warn the readers unfamiliar with the previously cited literature that , perhaps because of the contributions from many disciplines , the terminology which identifies these variables is hardly unified .",
    "for example , apart from the age , the definition of which seems uncontroversial ( @xmath0 in what follows ) , the survival time ( here indicated as @xmath1 ) is often also indicated as life expectancy , while input and output rates are often also called birth and death functions .",
    "the variable with possibly the most appellations is the so - called transit time ( @xmath2 ) , the sum of age and survival time , which is also indicated as travel time , life span , total life time , and sojourn time .",
    "as long as the mathematical formalism is clear and the notation kept consistent , as we have hopefully done here , we trust that these different names will not confuse the readers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the evolution equation for the joint distribution of age and survival time is introduced and solved in section [ sec : joint ] , with boundary conditions given by the survival time distribution at birth and the related age distribution at death .",
    "the solution is used to derive the transit time distribution by a simple integration in section [ sec : transit ] .",
    "the steady state conditions are discussed in section [ sec : steadystate ]",
    ". finally , we present some applications in section [ sec : applications ] with the purpose of showing some interesting details of the theory . while most of these applications have a close connection to hydrological and fluid mechanic systems , they are by necessity highly idealized to allow us to focus on the novel theoretical results , avoiding the additional complications that more realistic applications with random external forcing ( e.g , rainfall ) and spatial heterogeneities would add .",
    "the transit time ( @xmath2 ) of an element of a system is the sum of the time spent since the entrance / birth , called the age ( @xmath0 ) , and the time that it will spend before exit / death , called the survival time ( @xmath1 ) . at a given time @xmath3",
    ", each element is characterized by a certain age and survival ( and thus transit ) time , which globally can be described by the joint distribution @xmath4 . in words",
    ", @xmath5 represents the ( infinitesimal ) amount of elements ( e.g. , a mass or population number having age between @xmath0 and @xmath6 and survival time @xmath1 and @xmath7 at time @xmath3 .",
    "the balance equation for the joint distribution @xmath4 can be obtained considering that , as the system evolves in time , @xmath4 is conserved along the lines orthogonal to the bisector in the @xmath8 plane , which are characterized by having constant @xmath2 . based on these considerations ,",
    "one can readily write    @xmath9    the equation is controlled by the boundary conditions @xmath10 , which is the survival time distribution at input / birth , and @xmath11 , which is the age distribution at output / death .",
    "an example of the evolution of the joint distribution is shown in figure [ fig : translationbcs ] , showing how @xmath12 is simply the input boundary condition on the @xmath1 axis , translating in time along lines of constant @xmath2 until it crosses the @xmath0 axis where @xmath13 .",
    "the figure also clearly shows how the two boundary conditions can not be independent , as will be seen more precisely later .",
    "it is interesting that the contribution of input and output to the system is entirely felt through the boundary conditions . in more general cases",
    ", elements could also enter with age different from zero ( immigration ) or exit with a non - zero survival time ( emigration ) , in which case equation ( [ eq : jointeq ] ) should also contain corresponding source and sink terms ; these generalization however will not be pursued in this paper .",
    "more formally , moving along the characteristic curves , defined by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are obviously also lines of constant transit time , it is possible to re - express equation ( [ eq : jointeq ] ) as    @xmath17    so that the solution is then    @xmath18    or equivalently ,    @xmath19    from this it is evident how the joint distribution at a given time is simply the time shift of the boundary conditions and that , if time is reversed , the whole process is flipped , with the age playing the role of the survival time and vice versa .",
    "this type of time symmetry will appear frequently in the following .",
    "results from a simple translation of the boundary conditions . ]      by integrating equation ( [ eq : jointeq ] ) over @xmath1 , one obtains the mkendrick - von foerster ( mkvf ) equation @xcite , describing the dynamics of an age - structured population equation ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the age distribution ( mass over time ( age ) ) , quantifying the amount of substance having age @xmath0 at time @xmath3 . the sink term , @xmath22 , is the age distribution at output / death , previously introduced as a boundary condition for ( [ eq : jointeq ] ) .",
    "it can be written as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the age and mass specific output rate . with initial condition",
    "@xmath25 and boundary condition @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the input / birth rate , the solution of equation ( [ eq.mkvf ] ) is @xcite    @xmath28    on the other hand , by integrating ( [ eq : jointeq ] ) over @xmath0 , a corresponding equation for the survival time distribution is obtained ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 quantifies the amount of substance having survival @xmath1 at time @xmath3 . the source term @xmath31 is the survival time distribution at input / birth , which can be expressed as    @xmath32    with @xmath33 being the survival time and mass specific birth rate .",
    "the boundary condition is the overall output @xmath34 and the initial condition is @xmath35 .",
    "as for the mkvf equation , the solution is obtained with the method of characteristics as    @xmath36    by integrating again either equation ( [ eq.mkvf ] ) over @xmath0 or equation ( [ eq.mkvfsurv ] ) over @xmath1 , the familiar form of the balance equation is obtained ,    @xmath37    with    @xmath38    and where the input and output can also be written as @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    it should be noted that , when the solution of ( [ eq : jointeq ] ) is available , the age and survival distributions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the evolution of @xmath43 can be directly obtained by integrating the joint distribution @xmath4 , without need to go through the corresponding equations ( [ eq.mkvf ] ) , ( [ eq.mkvfsurv ] ) , and ( [ eq : balance ] ) . looking at these equations , it is also worth noting again the symmetry of the problem with respect to the time reversal , upon which age and survival time exchange their roles , with the output becoming the input and the age - specific loss function playing the part of the survival - specific birth function and vice versa .",
    "it is easy to see , in fact , that with these substitutions and @xmath44 , equation ( [ eq.mkvf ] ) and ( [ eq.mkvfsurv ] ) are interchangeable .",
    "it is possible at this point to establish a relationship between the age - specific output and the survival - specific input and , in turn , discuss the conditional distributions between age and survival times .",
    "the latter will be essential in deriving the residence time statistics in section [ sec : steadystate ] . to this purpose ,",
    "we begin by returning to equation ( [ eq : jointsol ] ) which immediately furnishes the relationship between the boundary conditions by setting either @xmath45 or @xmath13 ( see figure [ fig : translationbcs ] ) ,    @xmath46    these equations , when expressed in terms of their probability density functions ( pdfs ) normalized to have area one ,    @xmath47    become a relationship already obtained by @xcite ,    @xmath48    the subscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in particular , refer to the variables age at death and survival time at birth , respectively .",
    "they will be used explicitly when it is necessary to refer to them as random variables to distinguish them from age @xmath0 and survival time @xmath1 of the entire population , as in section [ sec : meanvalues ] .    from ( [ eq : relbc ] ) , a relationship between the birth and loss function is then obtained from the definition of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in equations ( [ eq : defloss ] ) and ( [ eq : defbirth ] ) , in which the respective solutions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be substituted from ( [ eq : mkvfsol ] ) and ( [ eq : mkvfsurvsol ] ) , giving    @xmath53    this clearly shows that the age- and survival - specific birth and loss functions are not independent .",
    "coming back to equation ( [ eq : jointsol2 ] ) , the joint distribution can be expressed in terms of the conditional distribution between age and survival time . to this purpose , it is more useful to consider the pdfs , instead of distributions , and define    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the marginal pdfs of age and survival time , respectively .    focusing , as an example , on the conditional pdf of survival given age",
    ", an expression can be derived combining ( [ eq : conditional ] ) and ( [ eq : jointsol2 ] ) ,    @xmath57    substituting in ( [ eq : conddistr ] ) the solutions for @xmath51 and @xmath58 given by ( @xmath59 ) and ( [ eq : defloss ] ) , one readily obtains    @xmath60    only when this expression is equal to the marginal distribution of age , are the age and survival time statistically independent . thus comparing with the marginal    @xmath61    one sees that , in general , marginal and conditional probability distributions are different",
    "this implies that ( when elements are sampled at random in the system ) age and survival are typically statistically dependent variables .",
    "this remains true , in transient conditions , even when the loss and birth functions are constant , because the two distributions remain different for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "further considerations on ( [ eq : condsol ] ) will be given , for steady state conditions in section [ sec : steadystate ] .",
    "as already said , the transit time , @xmath2 , is the total time spent by an element in the system , given by the sum of age and survival time ,    @xmath64    its distribution can thus be obtained as the distribution of the sum of the two random variables , the age and survival time , e.g. @xcite ,    @xmath65    which can also be written as    @xmath66    as shown in figure [ fig : linestconst ] , equation ( [ eq : intjoint2 ] ) is the integral along lines of constant @xmath2 , which are orthogonal to the bisector on the plane @xmath67 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : jointsol ] ) one also has    @xmath68    which tells us that we can know the transit time distribution at time @xmath3 by summing up the amount leaving the system with age @xmath69 within the time window @xmath70 .",
    "only when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are statistically independent is equation ( [ eq : transdistr ] ) a simple convolution integral .",
    "an alternative expression can be similarly obtained from equation ( [ eq : jointsol ] ) ,    @xmath71    which instead looks back to the time window ( @xmath72,@xmath3 ) and sums all the elements entering with survival time @xmath73 .    .",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are also indicated on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes , respectively . ]",
    "it may be useful to note that the transit time distribution refers in general to any element of the control volume ( or population ) . if one instead only focuses on the elements entering the system ( or the newborns ) , their transit time @xmath2 is equal to their survival time @xmath1 , because for them @xmath45 , and their distribution is @xmath76 .",
    "analogously , focusing on the elements leaving the system ( or dying ) , @xmath2 equals the age @xmath0 and their residence time distribution is the equal to @xmath77 .",
    "several of the previous relationships assume an interesting , simplified form at steady state , a necessary condition for which is that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are time independent .",
    "in such a case , the balance equation for a steady state system is simply    @xmath78    and from equation ( [ eq : jointsol ] ) it follows that    @xmath79    meaning that not only the overall input equals the overall output , but also that an input with a fixed age @xmath0 must be balanced by an output of equal survival time @xmath1 . as a result , the joint distribution @xmath80 is constant , and equal to @xmath81 along lines of constant @xmath2 .    in steady state conditions , age and survival time distributions",
    "are derived by taking @xmath82 in ( [ eq : mkvfsol ] ) and ( [ eq : mkvfsurvsol ] ) , that is    @xmath83    and    @xmath84    in particular , from ( [ eq : jointsol ] ) , the integral of @xmath80 over @xmath0 is the same as the integral over @xmath1 , suggesting that    @xmath85    in turn , it follows immediately that , at steady state , birth and loss functions must be equal ,    @xmath86    we note that the so - called survivor function @xcite , defined as the exceedance probability of survival at steady state , can be obtained by dividing either the age distribution or the survival distribution by the input @xmath87 ( or by the output @xmath88 ) ,    @xmath89    so that , as well known @xcite ,    @xmath90    the transit - time distribution at steady state can also be easily obtained by solving the integral in equation ( [ eq : transdistr ] ) and substituting equation ( [ eq : agesteady ] ) ,    @xmath91    or , normalized as a pdf ,    @xmath92    finally , regarding the conditional probabilities , from equation ( [ eq : conddistr ] ) ,    @xmath93    and    @xmath94    because of ( [ eq : equallossbirth ] ) , the two are obviously equal .",
    "comparing for example the distribution ( [ eq : ageconddistrsteady ] ) with the corresponding marginal pdf    @xmath95    it becomes clear that only for constant @xmath96 , are ( [ eq : survconddistrsteady ] ) and ( [ eq : ageconddistrsteady ] ) equal to their marginal distributions , thereby implying that age and survival time are statistically independent .",
    "this is essentially due to the rescaling ( or memoryless ) property of the resulting exponential distributions @xcite , which is the form taken by all these distributions in this special case ( see section 5.1 ) . in general , however , when the input and loss functions depend respectively on age and survival time , the two variables are statistically dependent , as will be shown in detail in the applications .      in steady state ,",
    "because of ( [ eq : equaldistr ] ) , the age distribution and survival distribution have same mean    @xmath97    the mean age at death and mean survival time at birth are also equal ,    @xmath98    while the mean transit time is then    @xmath99    with regard to the mean transit time , by definition ,    @xmath100    where the last equality has been obtained by multiplying and dividing by the output @xmath88 .",
    "now , remembering that    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the variance of the respective variable , then one obtains the exact relationship    @xmath103    thus , in general , @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 represents an upper bound for both mean age and mean survival time . in particular , @xmath106 equals @xmath105 only when the loss function is a dirac delta function , for which the variance of @xmath2 is zero , as in the case of a plug - flow system .",
    "in addition , substituting expression ( [ eq : ageand transit ] ) into the equation above , an exact link between @xmath107 and @xmath106 is also obtained as    @xmath108    the same condition was obtained in a somewhat different way by @xcite . only in the case of @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "constant , then @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , while for a dirac delta loss function , @xmath114 .",
    "the manner in which input and loss functions depend on age and survival time plays a key role in determining whether the mean of the age and survival time , @xmath107 and @xmath115 , are greater or lower than the mean age at death and the mean survival time at birth , @xmath116 and @xmath117 . for example , as already discussed by @xcite and @xcite , in the case of a loss function @xmath109 which selects preferably young elements leaving older element to age in the system , the resulting mean age at death is lower than the mean age in the system , i.e. , @xmath118 . on the contrary",
    ", the case @xmath119 is true whenever older elements tend to be chosen by @xmath109 , leaving young ones to keep the mean age low in the system , compared to the mean age at death ( see section [ app4 ] ) .",
    "we present four examples to illustrate the previously discussed theory .",
    "the first is a simple steady state system with constant birth and loss functions .",
    "the second consists of a plug - flow system in which all the elements have the same transit time .",
    "the third application is characterized by a periodicity of the age - independent loss function , while the fourth one focuses on the role of age - dependence in the loss function .",
    "this simplest case , which represents a well - mixed system , serves as a point of reference for the more complex cases presented later .",
    "it is characterized by constant and equal birth and loss function ,    @xmath120    so that the balance equation gives    @xmath121    while the normalized age and survival time distributions are    @xmath122    with mean @xmath123 ( see figure [ fig : linstead ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the same exponential function results from ( [ eq : survconddistrsteady ] ) and ( [ eq : ageconddistrsteady ] ) for the conditional pdfs , so that in these special case age and survival are statistical independent and their joint distribution is simply the product of the two distributions .    the age distribution at death ( survival time distribution at birth )",
    "is simply obtained by multiplying @xmath124 by @xmath125 ( @xmath126 by @xmath125 ) ,    @xmath127    which in its normalized form is equal to the age distribution , @xmath128 , and similarly with @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the mean values are    @xmath131    the transit time distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linstead ] ) is calculated from equation ( [ eq : transdistrsteady ] ) ,    @xmath132    which , written as a pdf , becomes    @xmath133    an erlang-2 distribution for the sum of two independent , exponentially distributed random variables ( see figure [ fig : linstead ] ) , with mean @xmath134 @xcite .    .",
    "the distributions are calculated for @xmath135 and @xmath136 . ]",
    "while in the previous example age and survival time were statistically independent , this application takes the opposite extreme of complete ( i.e. , deterministic ) dependence . to this purpose , we assume that the survival distribution at birth is a dirac delta on a specific survival time @xmath137 , modulated sinusoidally in time ,    @xmath138    with @xmath139 . because all the elements exit after the prescribed time @xmath137 , this example is representative of a time - dependent plug - flow system .    at the outlet ,",
    "the age distribution at death @xmath51 is the time shifted @xmath52 , i.e. ,    @xmath140    while inside the system , the age distribution is given by    @xmath141    where @xmath142 is the heaviside function @xcite .",
    "the survival time distribution is    @xmath143    while the joint distribution is given by    @xmath144    see figure [ fig : deltaapp ] .",
    "the transit time distribution can be calculated from ( [ eq : transdistr2 ] ) ,    @xmath145    and the conditional distribution ,    @xmath146    which reflects a deterministic relationship between age and survival , imposed by the survival distribution at birth ( see figure [ fig : deltaapp ] ) .",
    "imposed as a dirac delta modulated by the sinusoidal amplitude in ( [ eq : impsurv ] ) , with @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the marginal distributions of age and survival time are also plotted on the corresponding vertical planes . ]",
    "we now consider an extension of the first application , in which the input is constant but the loss function , although still independent of age , is now time periodic ,    @xmath150    from a hydrological point of view , this case is representative of a system with rainfall homogeneously distributed during the year but with seasonally modulated potential evapotranspiration and negligible other losses ,    @xmath151    the system is still well - mixed , although the transient conditions bring about additional complications that result in statistical dependence between age and survival .    considering @xmath152 so that the system has forgotten the initial conditions and has settled on a periodic steady state , the age distribution is from ( [ eq : mkvfsol ] )    @xmath153    while the joint distribution can be obtained through equations ( [ eq : jointsol2 ] ) ,    @xmath154    the joint distribution is plotted in figure ( [ fig : jointappperiod ] ) for different days of the year corresponding to the four seasons .",

    "<S> although the concepts of age , survival and transit time have been widely used in many fields , including population dynamics , chemical engineering , and hydrology , a comprehensive mathematical framework is still missing . here </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several relationships among these quantities by starting from the evolution equation for the joint distribution of age and survival , from which the equations for age and survival time readily follow . </S>",
    "<S> it also becomes apparent how the statistical dependence between age and survival is directly related to either the age - dependence of the loss function or the survival - time dependence of the input function . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the joint distribution equation also allows us to obtain the relationships between the age at exit ( or death ) and the survival time at input ( or birth ) , as well as to stress the symmetries of the various distributions under time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> the transit time is then obtained as a sum of the age and survival time , and its properties are discussed along with the general relationships between their mean values . </S>",
    "<S> the special case of steady state case is analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> some examples , inspired by hydrologic applications , are presented to illustrate the theory with the specific results . </S>"
