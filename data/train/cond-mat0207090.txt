    "shape memory alloys ( sma ) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their important technological applications , including mechanical actuator devices and medical stents .",
    "the shape memory effect also gives rise to superelasticity , which finds applications in stents and spectacle frames .",
    "the shape memory effect is related to a reversible martensitic ( diffusionless ) phase transformation .",
    "it has been shown that the martensitic transformation can be induced by applied fields , temperature or both , and the mechanical properties of materials , therefore , can be controlled accordingly . in many systems , including those discussed in the present work , alloying can dramatically change the properties and transition temperatures of the materials , reflecting the importance of electronic features , specifically fermi surface effects , in the structural energetics of sma .",
    "there are several complementary approaches to modelling of the shape memory effect .",
    "continuum modelling allows investigation of the microstructural behavior , specifically martensitic twins , at the relevant long length scales .",
    "material - specific behavior is incorporated through an empirical functional for the free energy in terms of strain and a twin boundary energy to set the length scale . in atomistic models ,",
    "the individual atoms are considered explicitly and their interaction given by an interatomic potential , which may be determined empirically , from first - principles density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations , or a combination of the two .",
    "crystal symmetry and defect energies emerge from this approach , which gives microstructures with both natural length scales ( from defect energies ) and time scales ( since the atoms have definite newtonian forces and masses ) .",
    "however , in atomistic models , the electronic degrees of freedom do not appear explicitly .",
    "first principles dft methods are so computationally intensive that direct studies of microstructural behavior are impossible , but they are valuable both for obtaining quantitative atomic - level information regarding energies , forces and stresses independent of empirical input , and for understanding the electronic origin of this behavior .",
    "thus , first - principles investigation of the energetic instability of the high - temperature structure towards the low - symmetry martensitic structure is in itself quite illuminating .",
    "the resulting information can then also be used as inputs to atomistic@xcite and continuum modelling of shape memory behavior .",
    "typically , martensitic transformations are described using the strain as an order parameter , the classic example being the bain bcc - fcc transformation of iron .",
    "however , there is an alternative approach appropriate for cases where the strain degrees of freedom are coupled to atomic degrees of freedom ( phonons ) . following the soft - mode theory of structural transitions,@xcite we start from a high - symmetry reference structure ( here @xmath2 ) and freeze in unstable phonons of this structure , with corresponding lattice relaxation , to produce the ground - state structure .",
    "the symmetry of the phonons determines the symmetry of the low temperature structure .",
    "this approach has been successfully used in the study of minerals@xcite and ferroelectric materials @xcite and has been extended to shape memory alloys in our previous study of niti@xcite .",
    "closely related to niti , pdti and ptti are shape memory materials with reasonable structural simplicity and extraordinary mechanical behavior .",
    "they undergo a martensitic transformation at tunable temperatures : pdti transforms at 810k , but this can be reduced to 410k with 8% substitution of cr for pd@xcite .",
    "the high - temperature `` austenitic '' phase has a simple cubic @xmath2 structure ( space group @xmath3 ) , while the ambient temperature `` martensitic '' phase has been reported as the orthorhombic @xmath0 structure@xcite ( space group : @xmath4 ) .",
    "previous first - principles studies in pdti and ptti@xcite have shown that the observed electronic and elastic properties of the @xmath0 structure are well reproduced by density - functional theory calculations assuming the experimentally determined structure .    in this paper , we investigate the structural energetics of pdti and ptti from first - principles calculations of phonon frequencies as well as total energies .",
    "this allows us to examine local as well as global stability and to investigate transition mechanisms , drawing on the strong analogy between the @xmath2-@xmath0 and bcc - hcp transformations and showing that coupling of unstable modes to the strain is a crucial aspect of the structural energetics . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the first - principles calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present and discuss the results for the phonon dispersion of pdti and ptti in the @xmath2 structure and for the relaxed structures in which unstable modes and strains are coupled , yielding a low - symmetry ground state .",
    "in addition , we present results of calculations of the electronic structure , identifying and discussing features that affect the relative stability of the phases .",
    "v concludes the paper .",
    "first - principles total energy calculations were carried out within density - functional theory with a plane - wave pseudopotential approach .",
    "the calculations were performed with the vienna _ ab - initio _",
    "simulations package@xcite , using the perdew - zunger@xcite parametrization of the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite were used .",
    "our pseudopotentials include nonlinear core corrections and for ti , we treated the occupied @xmath5 levels as valence .",
    "the electronic wave functions were represented in a plane - wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 278ev .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations were carried out by the hermite - gaussian smearing technique @xcite with the smearing parameter of 0.1ev .",
    "the unit cells contain two atoms in the cubic @xmath2 structure and four atoms in the orthorhombic @xmath0 and monoclinic @xmath1 structures .",
    "the calculations were performed with a @xmath6 monkhorst - pack ( mp ) @xmath7point mesh for the cubic @xmath2 structure and a @xmath8 mp @xmath7point mesh for both orthorhombic @xmath0 and monoclinic @xmath1 structures ( space group : @xmath9 ) , corresponding to 120 @xmath10 points in the @xmath11 irreducible bz of the simple cubic cell , 288 @xmath10 points in the @xmath12 irreducible bz of the orthorhombic cell and 576 @xmath10 points in the @xmath13 irreducible bz of the monoclinic cell .",
    "this choice of parameters converges the total energy to within 1  mev / atom .",

    "the bz s for the orthorhombic @xmath0 and monoclinic @xmath1 structures are different . to compare the band structure of the two structures , we label the @xmath0 band structure by regarding the @xmath0 structure as a special case of @xmath1 .",

    "integrations were carried out by the hermite - gaussian smearing technique @xcite using a 56 _ k_-point mesh ( corresponding to @xmath14 regular divisions along the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes ) in the @xmath11 irreducible wedge .",
    "the value of the smearing parameter was @xmath18=0.2ev .",
    "these parameters yield phonon frequencies converged within 5 @xmath19 .",
    "the dynamical matrix was computed on a @xmath20 _ q_-point mesh commensurate with the _ k_-point mesh .",
    "the complete phonon dispersion relation was obtained through the computation of real - space interatomic force constants within the corresponding box@xcite .",
    "the choice to use two different first - principles codes was dictated by the individual strengths of each .",
    "vasp has a highly efficient scheme for calculating total energies , forces , and stresses , and relaxing to the minimum energy structure , but does not have the density - functional perturbation theory capabilities of pwscf / phonon .",
    "even with slightly different pseudopotentials and _ k_-point sampling , the results of the two codes are quite compatible .",
    "for example , the difference between the computed lattice parameters for the @xmath2 structure of pdti is less than 0.2% , and for ptti the difference is less than 0.1% .",
    "comparisons of normalized eigenvector components computed by vasp using the frozen phonon method and by pwscf / phonon also show good agreement , generally within 5% .",
    "for the cubic @xmath2 structure , our calculations yield the equilibrium lattice parameters of 3.112  and 3.125  for pdti and ptti respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also performed full - potential linearized - augmented - plane - wave calculations ( flapw ) within the lda@xcite .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with flapw results of 3.113  ( pdti ) and 3.127  ( ptti ) and in in good agreement with experimental values of 3.18  and 3.17 .",
    "the phonon dispersion relations along high symmetry lines , computed at the theoretical lattice parameters , are shown in figure  [ phonons ] .",
    "the frequencies are obtained by taking the square root of the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix@xcite .",
    "imaginary frequencies , as plotted as negative , are obtained from negative eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix .",
    "thus , the structure is dynamically unstable against distortions following the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "it should be noted that the phonon frequency @xmath21 is _ not _ the reciprocal of the period of oscillation of this mode ( as measured in molecular dynamics ) nor is it the energy difference between adjacent quantum levels ( as measured in neutron scattering experiments ) .",
    "these three quantities are equal only for a stable harmonic crystal . in the materials studied here the unstable modes may be related to a soft mode@xcite ( as defined by md or neutron scattering ) at high temperature , and even the stable modes are expected to be significantly renormalized as a function of temperature by anharmonic effects .",

    "the imaginary frequencies of the unstable modes are plotted as negative values.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the dynamical matrices are related by mass factors to the force constant matrix : the second derivatives of the internal energy with respect to atomic displacements .",
    "the eigenmodes of the force constant matrix describe the potential energy landscape , and a negative eigenvalue indicates a static instability against a distortion following the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "while the actual normalized displacements of these eigenmodes are in general slightly different they carry the same symmetry labels as the eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix .",
    "either choice is expected to serve as a useful pointer to a lower energy structure if the distorted structure obtained by  freezing in \" an unstable mode is relaxed using first - principles forces and stresses , as we describe below .",
    "the phonon dispersion relations shown in figure  [ phonons ] show instability of the @xmath2 structure similar to and even stronger than that of niti@xcite .",
    "there are large regions of reciprocal space where one , two or even three modes are unstable , with dominant instabilities at @xmath24 and along @xmath25-@xmath26 .",
    "the phonon instability shows that the observed high - temperature @xmath2 phases of pdti and ptti are dynamically stabilized by anharmonic phonons , and should be characterized by large fluctuating local distortions .",
    "the calculated phonon dispersions are also reminiscent of those of unstable bcc materials such as zr and ti , which undergo martensitic transformations to hcp or @xmath21@xcite ( via the @xmath24 and @xmath25-@xmath26 bcc - phonon equivalents respectively ) phases .",
    "the analogy based on the view of @xmath0 phases of pdti and ptti as chemically ordered hcp will be further strengthened below .    in the soft mode approach , we search for local energy minima by choosing an unstable mode of the high symmetry structure , freezing in the distortion with varying amplitude , and relaxing the resulting structure .",
    "in many cases , the mode with the largest negative eigenvalue will generate the lowest energy structure . however , this is by no means generally true , as the energy gain is determined not only by the curvature of the energy surface but by higher order terms as well as the strength of coupling to strain and other modes , both unstable and stable , of appropriate symmetry .",
    "indeed , in pdti this `` most unstable '' mode ( i.e. largest negative eigenvalue ) lies in the @xmath25-@xmath26 branch rather than at @xmath24 .",
    "this mode is typically unstable in dynamically - stabilized bcc materials such as titanium and zirconium where it is associated with a phase transition to the ideal @xmath21 ( @xmath27 ) phase .",
    "the fact that in the chemically ordered analog ( pd / pt)ti , the observed phase transition is to @xmath0 rather than @xmath27 illustrates the importance of anharmonic effects and strain coupling in the energetics of these materials .",
    "eigenmode of the doubly - degenerate @xmath28 unstable phonon in the @xmath2 structure .",
    "this mode generates the @xmath0 structure in pdti and ptti .",
    "the structure is shown projected along the @xmath29 direction , with pd / pt represented by filled circles and ti by open circles . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         in the soft - mode approach , there is no guarantee that the energy - minimizing freezing - in of one unstable mode will stablize the other unstable modes of the high - symmetry structure . in the present case ,",
    "the undistorted doubled unit cell contains two sets of ( 110)@xmath30 planes each of which is unstable to strain - coupled shuffling at all _ q-_points .",
    "the simplest such mode in the @xmath0 structure is @xmath31 , which lowers the symmetry to monoclinic @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 structure has three additional free parameters : the monoclinic angle @xmath33 and two internal parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these values are given for the relaxed @xmath1 structure in table  [ table : struct ] , and compared with the normalized eigenvector displacements in table  [ table : ratio ] .",
    "however , it is important to note that the computed @xmath25 phonon modes in the @xmath0 structures are in fact all stable ( table  [ table : phonon - gamma ] ) .",
    "the lowering of energy by distortion to @xmath1 can not be obtained by a pure @xmath31 phonon distortion , but only if the strain is allowed to relax simulataneously ( table  [ table : struct ] )",
    ". this may be the reason that in a previous calculation @xcite , @xmath0 was reported to be the minimum energy structure .",
    "the relative energies of the various relaxed structures are given in table [ table : struct ] .",
    "the @xmath0 total energy is lower than @xmath2 . a simple estimate of the transition temperature is given by @xmath36 which suggest @xmath37 of 1050k ( pdti ) and 1755k ( ptti ) .",
    "these rough values are significantly larger than the experimental data for the hysteretical transition region@xcite ( approximately 800k and 1400k respectively ) , but show the correct material trend . for neither system",
    "has a @xmath1 phase yet been observed experimentally .",
    "the small computed energy differences between @xmath1 and @xmath1 , translated into temperature , are 28k and 39k for pdti and ptti , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the transition to the @xmath1 phase should occur at temperatures well below those at which the experiments were performed , so that our results are fully consistent with the available experimental work .",
    "+        +      the binary - hcp phase interpretation also suggests that we should examine the binary - fcc equivalent , which is the @xmath38 phase .",
    "@xmath38 is accessible from @xmath2 by a simple ( 001 ) shear and has lower energy@xcite , however we find that @xmath38 has slightly higher energy than @xmath0 .",
    "we consider one further structure : at the special @xmath1 values @xmath39 and @xmath40 , orthorhombic symmetry is restored .",
    "the side of the conventional cell of this body centered orthorhombic ( bco ) ( space group @xmath41 ) structure is doubled in the * b * direction , though the primitive cell still contains four atoms .",
    "although at relatively high energy (  [ table : struct ] ) , this provides us a reference point for structures with large @xmath33@xcite .",
    "note that a further shear to @xmath42 would give the @xmath0 structure once more .",
    "the potential energies of continuous paths between the structures identified above are important for understanding the transformation mechanism .",
    "we compute the energies of three paths : @xmath2-@xmath0 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath1-bco . in keeping with the timescale separation between bulk strain and atomic motion ,",
    "we define intermediate configurations by relaxing the atoms to their minimum energy configuration consistent with the applied symmetry and strain on the cell .",
    "the remaining four strain degrees of freedom are reduced to a single parameter by taking interpolations between the strains of the endpoint structures . for the @xmath2 structure ,",
    "we minimize the energy assuming the @xmath0 space group , which gives a smooth evolution of the structure along the path .",
    "> from figure  [ tote ] , it is clear that there is no total energy barrier along the @xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath1 path , and that @xmath0 represents the total energy barrier between @xmath1 martensitic variants .",
    "the @xmath0 phase can be viewed as the binary equivalent of hcp , and the transformation path as the binary equivalent of the nishiyama - wassermann ( nw ) path . using the analogy with the nw mechanism for the bcc - hcp transition",
    ", we can attribute the transition to a shuffling of ( 110)@xmath30 planes@xcite .",
    "structural instabilities in metals are typically related to details of the fermi surface , and we have calculated the band structures of @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 to investigate this .",
    "in pdti / ptti the band structure is dominated by the _ d_-bands , with the pd / pt bands lying below the fermi level and almost fully occupied , and the ti @xmath43-bands lying above the fermi level ( figure  [ bands - pdti ] and  [ bands - ptti ] ) , the band centers being offset by some 6ev . the free - electron like @xmath44 bands are very broad , and play little role in the bonding except to donate some electrons to the ti - d band .",
    "the large strain involved in the @xmath45 transition means that the fermi surfaces are quite different ( @xmath0 having the lowest dos at @xmath46@xcite ) and this transition can not be related directly to the band structure . by contrast , the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition is accompanied by the opening of a pseudogap at the fermi level , a typical signature of increased stability .",
    "the band structures are very similar , the small difference which stabilises @xmath1 being traceable to the shifting above the fermi level of a pocket of electrons around @xmath47 .",
    "the distortion to @xmath1 is just enough to complete the topological phase transition which eliminates this pocket of electrons in both materials .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed _ ab initio _ calculations of the structural energetics of pdti and ptti . in each case",
    "we predict that the low temperature ground state structure will be @xmath1 , with the ( observed ) @xmath2 and @xmath0 phases being dynamically stabilized .",
    "there are no total energy barriers between the structures , meaning that the phase space microstates that belong to the @xmath1 structure _ also _ belong to the @xmath0 and @xmath2 structures .",
    "in contrast to niti@xcite , the entire @xmath22 phonon branch is unstable .",
    "we showed that the @xmath0 structure can be obtained by a `` freezing in '' of phonons of the @xmath2 structure coupled to the shear associated with the @xmath48 elastic constant , but that no single dynamical - matrix or force - constant - matrix eigenvector leads to the low - symmetry phase .",
    "the @xmath1 then corresponds to a further strain coupled to a @xmath31 phonon of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "tracing the atomic motions of these instabilities shows that they are both related to shears of alternate @xmath49 phases , and hence that the transition mechanism is the binary equivalent of the nishiyama - wassermann bcc - hcp mechanism .",
