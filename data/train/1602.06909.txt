    "the srvo@xmath0 thin films measured at soleil were grown at the gemac laboratory , onto atomically flat tio@xmath3-terminated ( 100 ) srtio@xmath0 substrates by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) under a partial oxygen pressure of @xmath43  torr at temperature of @xmath44c . a 248  nm wavelength krf excimer laser was employed with a repetition rate of 1  hz and a fluency of 1.9  j/@xmath45 . during the growth , surface structure was characterized by reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) . after the growth , oxygen pressure was reduced to @xmath46  torr when the sample was cooled to room temperature .",
    "surface morphology was carried out with atomic force microscopy ( afm , bruker dimension 3100 ) in tapping mode and the root mean square ( rms ) roughness of the film was 0.4  nm . to clean the surfaces in uhv prior to arpes experiments at soleil",

    "after the uhv annealing , the quality of the surfaces was confirmed by low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) .",
    "the srvo@xmath0 films measured at kek were grown _ in - situ _",
    ", on a pld chamber directly accessible from the arpes uhv chamber , on single - crystalline 0.05  wt% nb - doped srtio@xmath0  @xmath54 substrates .",
    "the substrates were annealed at @xmath55c under an oxygen pressure of @xmath56  torr to obtain atomically flat tio@xmath3-terminated surfaces .",
    "the srvo@xmath0 thin film was deposited on the substrate at @xmath57c , under a high vacuum below @xmath58  torr , to obtain an uhv clean surface , using a sr@xmath3v@xmath3o@xmath23 target , which has excess oxygen with respect to srvo@xmath0 , and thus minimizes the formation of vacancies during the growth .",
    "leed measurements confirmed clean cristalline srvo@xmath0 films with a @xmath59 surface reconstruction .",
    "the surface morphology of the measured thin films was confirmed by _ ex - situ _ atomic force microscopy , showing atomically flat step - and - terrace structure .",
    "the coherent growth of these srvo@xmath0 thin film was confirmed by four - circle x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "the characterization results are essentially identical to those reported in previous studies  @xcite , and indicate that there are no detectable structural disorders in the prepared srvo@xmath0 thin films grown on nb : srtio@xmath60  @xmath54 substrates .",
    "the arpes measurements were conducted at the cassiopee beamline of synchrotron soleil ( france ) , and at beamline 2a of kek - photon factory ( kek - pf , japan ) .",
    "we used linearly polarized photons in the energy range @xmath61  ev and hemispherical electron analyzers with vertical slits at soleil and horizontal slits at kek - pf .",
    "the angular and energy resolutions were @xmath62 and 15  mev .",
    "the mean diameter of the incident photon beam was smaller than 100  @xmath63 m .",
    "the uv light brilliance , measured using calibrated photodiodes , was @xmath17 at soleil , and about 100 times smaller at kek - pf .",
    "the ( 001 ) oriented srvo@xmath0 samples were cooled down to @xmath64  k before measuring .",
    "unless specified otherwise , all data was taken at that temperature .",
    "measuring at such low temperature minimizes any possible diffusion of oxygen vacancies into the bulk .",
    "the results have been reproduced on more than 5 samples .",

    "the indices @xmath68 , @xmath25 , and @xmath69 of @xmath70 correspond to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the cubic unit cell of srvo@xmath0 .",
    "the surface reconstruction in our srvo@xmath0 thin films leads to the occurence of surface umklapp bands in the arpes spectra , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : surface - umklapps](a ,  b ) for data taken with linear horizontal and linear vertical photons polarizations , respectively . these extra bands ,",
    "best observed with linear horizontal photons , result simply from the folding of the bulk bands at the surface due to the superposition of the bulk and the reconstructed surface periodicities .",
    "their presence is a final - state effect and does not affect the bulk electronic structure or the effects due to oxygen vacancies discussed in this work .",
    "note that the spectra taken with linear vertical photons show both the light and heavy bands expected for the intrinsic bulk electronic structure of srvo@xmath0 , discussed in the next section .",

    "[ fig : surface - umklapps](b ) , which was taken using linear vertical photons and a hemispherical electron analyzer with horizontal slits .",
    "this configuration of experimental geometry and light polarization allows observing both the light and heavy conduction bands of srvo@xmath0 .",
    "we fit these bands using simple cosine dispersions of the form @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a constant , @xmath74 is the bandwidth , and @xmath75 is the in - plane lattice parameter of the srvo@xmath0 thin films ( @xmath76    in the case of films grown on srtio@xmath0 ) . for small @xmath77 , each cosine band can be approximated by a free - electron - like parabola of effective mass @xmath78 given by @xmath79 .",
    "the best fits , shown by the continuous red curves in fig .  [ fig : svo - light - heavy - bands ] , yield effective masses @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the light and heavy bands , respectively ( @xmath82 is the free electron mass ) .",

    "[ fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](a ,  b ) , the fermi momenta and band filling of the qp conduction band are independent of the uv dose .",
    "this ensures that the fermi surface maps are exempt of extrinsic spurious effects due to the uv - assisted creation of oxygen vacancies .",
    "our measured fermi surface agrees with previous arpes reports on the electronic structure of srvo@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bulk 3d character of our measured fermi surface is demonstrated by the observation , in fig .",

    "can be directly calculated from the volume enclosed by the measured fermi surface ( @xmath86 ) as @xmath87 . in very good approximation",

    "this gives @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the unit - cell volume ) , which is in excellent agreement with the expected value of 1 electron per vanadium .",
    "this again confirms that our arpes measurements probe the 3d bulk fermi surface .",

    "this eliminates the need to re - anneal in vacuum to clean the surface , and thus minimizes the formation of oxygen vacancies before the measurements .",
    "additionally , the spectra were measured using ultra - low doses of uv light . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "this careful measurement protocol prevents the formation of oxygen vacancies , allowing to acquire high - quality data that shows no significant evolution with accumulation time , even after several hours of measurements .",
    "thus , we define the obtained spectra as the `` intrinsic '' ( occupied part of the ) spectral function of srvo@xmath0 .",

    "we assume that ( i ) the multiple impurity atoms only hybridize with an effective bath that is determined self - consistently and ( ii ) the intersite hybridization to be small .",
    "this allows us to solve the impurity problems separately and to write the full self - energy in bloch space as @xmath97 where the sum is performed over all impurity atoms @xmath75 , with the corresponding projection operators @xmath98 .",

    "<S> some preeminent examples that have gathered the interest for almost 30 years are high temperature superconductivity , colossal magnetoresistance , heavy fermion physics and , of course , the mott metal - insulator transition itself  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> significant theoretical progress was made with the introduction of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) and its combination with _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ density functional methods ( lda+dmft ) , which allows treatment of the interactions promoting itinerancy and localization of electrons on equal footing  @xcite . among the most emblematic achievements of dmft is the prediction of a hubbard satellite , which splits off of the conduction band of a metal . </S>",
    "<S> this satellite results from the partial localization of conduction electrons due to their mutual coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> early dmft studies also showed that it is the precursor of the localized electronic states of a mott insulator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since then , these predictions promoted a large number of studies using photoemission spectroscopy , which is a technique to directly probe the presence of hubbard bands . in this context , the tmo system srvo@xmath0 has emerged as the _ drosophila _ model system to test the predictions of strongly correlated electron theories . in fact , srvo@xmath0 is arguably the simplest correlated metal . </S>",
    "<S> it is a simple cubic perovskite , with nominally one electron per v site , which occupies a 3 fold degenerate @xmath8 conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> while the presence of a satellite in the photoemission spectra of ni metal was already well known , in the context of correlated tmos , the hubbard band was originally reported in a systematic investigation of ca@xmath9sr@xmath10vo@xmath0  @xcite , which was followed by many subsequent studies , including arpes  @xcite and comparison with theoretical predictions ( see for instance refs .   among others ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most salient features in srvo@xmath0 is the observation of a broad peak at an energy of about @xmath11  ev in angle integrated photoemission spectra , ( upper black curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : compsto - kto - tio2-svo ] ) , which is interpreted as a hubbard satellite linked to the v @xmath8 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is also seen in a large range of @xmath12 materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of spectral strength between the quasiparticle state and the incoherent satellite in srvo@xmath0 is an important indicator of the magnitude of electron correlations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , photoemission experiments using different photon energies or light brilliance have reported very dissimilar values for such ratio  @xcite , making the quantitative benchmarking of realistic _ ab - initio _ </S>",
    "<S> theories for correlated - electron systems difficult  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : compsto - kto - tio2-svo ] , a broad peak at about the same energy is also observed in several @xmath1 tmo cubic perovskites , such as srtio@xmath0 , ktao@xmath0 , or anatase tio@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in all these cases the feature has been clearly linked to the presence of oxygen defects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , recent _ ab initio _ calculations show that spectral weight at @xmath13  ev in srtio@xmath0 most likely is not of ti @xmath8 orbital character , but should be understood as an in - gap defect state with ti @xmath14 character  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we are confronted with the fact that at about @xmath15  ev below the fermi level , we find the lower hubbard bands of @xmath16 systems as well as the in - gap states of oxygen - deficient @xmath1 systems . in view of these observations </S>",
    "<S> one may unavoidably wonder ( and worry ) , despite the great success of dmft methods , whether the putative hubbard satellite of srvo@xmath0 might also originate from oxygen vacancies states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one should also worry about the possibility of these extrinsic states affecting the features of the conduction band dispersion . in the present work we resolve these issues in a thorough manner . </S>",
    "<S> we present a systematic photoemission study of srvo@xmath0 , to demonstrate dramatic consequences in the spectra due to production of oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> using arpes , we directly show that the uv / x rays used for measurements can produce a large enhancement , of almost an order of magnitude , of the peak at @xmath11  ev , similar to the effect observed in @xmath1 oxide insulators  @xcite . despite these significant effects on the energy states around the mott - hubbard band , we are able to determine the _ intrinsic _ bulk srvo@xmath0 photoemission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the presence of oxygen vacancies is avoided , a clear signal of the correlated hubbard band remains . </S>",
    "<S> we support the interpretation of the experimental data by means of state - of - the - art lda+dmft calculations on srvo@xmath0 _ with oxygen vacancies_. consistent with our experimental data , the calculations show that oxygen vacancies produce states ( of @xmath14 symmetry ) at energies near the hubbard satellite . while our study provides definite evidence of a correlated hubbard band in srvo@xmath0 as predicted by dmft , it also underlines the significant effects due to oxygen vacancies , which may also affect photoemission data in other tmos . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](a ) shows the integrated photoemission spectra of srvo@xmath0 as a function of the uv dose , measured at the cassiopee beamline of soleil synchrotron under the same conditions of uv light brilliance ( about @xmath17 ) of any standard arpes experiment at a third - generation synchrotron . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were done by continuously irradiating the sample with @xmath18  ev photons while recording the spectra as a function of irradiation time , with an accumulation time of about 2  minutes per spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the blue and black curves show spectra for the lowest and highest measured doses , obtained respectively after @xmath19  minutes and @xmath19  hours of irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> these data clearly demonstrate that the very uv / x rays used for photoemission experiments can effect radical changes in the measured spectra of srvo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> note in fact that a similar effect has been observed for vo@xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , from fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](a ) we observe that the amplitude of the in - gap state at @xmath11  ev , and more significantly , the ratio of in - gap to quasiparticle ( qp ) amplitudes , strongly increase with increasing uv dose , going from about @xmath20 in a pristine sample to more than @xmath21 in a heavily irradiated sample . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , note that the qp peak position remains basically dose - independent , implying that the carriers created by the uv / x irradiation do not significantly dope the conduction band , and form dominantly localized states . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](b ) , which shows that the fermi momenta of the qp band , given by the peaks positions in the momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) at @xmath2 , are also dose - independent . </S>",
    "<S> additional data presented in the supplemental material further demonstrate that our measurements yield the expected 3d bulk fermi surface of srvo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observed increase in intensity of the in - gap state upon uv irradiation _ can not _ be ascribed to a change in filling of the conduction band , which could have affected the electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> instead , this unambiguously shows the light - assisted formation of localized defect states at essentially the same energy as that of the expected intrinsic lower hubbard band which should then resemble the in - gap peak observed at the lowest uv doses . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as mentioned previously , it is well established that strong doses of uv / x rays create a large concentration of oxygen vacancies in several @xmath1 perovskites  @xcite . as illustrated in figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](c ,  d ) for the case of srtio@xmath0 , the progressive doping of the surface region with oxygen vacancies , due to synchrotron uv irradiation , has two effects : formation of a very intense in - gap state at about @xmath13  ev , and , in contrast to srvo@xmath0 , simultaneous creation of a sharp qp peak at @xmath2 corresponding to a confined quasi-2d electron gas ( 2deg ) at the samples surface . </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass of such 2deg , precisely determined by arpes , matches the mass expected from density functional theory calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as in srvo@xmath0 , the increase in intensity of the in - gap state observed in srtio@xmath0 upon uv / x irradiation can not be due to an onset or increase of electron correlations , and should be ascribed to an extrinsic effect . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that , in srvo@xmath0 , exposure to synchrotron uv / x rays creates oxygen vacancies , which are in turn responsible for the extrinsic increase in intensity of the in - gap state evidenced by our measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , never discussed or taken into account before , can seriously obscure the determination of the intrinsic spectral function of this model system , thus hampering the advancement of valid theories for correlated - electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> all the previous findings imply that the correct experimental determination of the _ intrinsic _ spectral function of srvo@xmath0 should _ ( i ) _ use samples that from the beginning have the lowest possible concentration of oxygen vacancies , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ use doses of uv or x - ray light low enough to avoid any change in the measured spectra . to this end , we measured bulk crystalline thin - films of srvo@xmath0/nb : srtio@xmath0 grown _ in - situ _ , in a pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) chamber directly connected to the arpes setup , at the beamline 2a of kek - photon factory ( kek - pf )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pld growth was performed under a pressure below @xmath22  torr , to obtain an uhv - clean surface , using a sr@xmath3v@xmath3o@xmath23 target , which has excess oxygen with respect to srvo@xmath0 , thus minimizing the formation of vacancies during the growth see the supplemental material for further details . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the uv light brilliance used in these experiments was about @xmath24 times lower than the one in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](a ,  b ) from measurements at soleil . we checked ( supplemental material ) that under these conditions the spectra did not change with time , even after several hours of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting energy - momentum arpes map is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly observes the dispersion in the qp band along with the weaker intensity in - gap state , the intrinsic lower hubbard band , similar as previously reported  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](f ) shows the momentum - resolved electronic structure of a sample , measured at soleil , that was intensively irradiated . </S>",

    "<S> while comparing with the measured @xmath25-resolved spectral function , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svo - vs - sto - uvdose](e ) , one should bear in mind that along @xmath31-x ( or @xmath31-y ) the heavy @xmath37 ( or @xmath36 ) bands are silenced by dipole - transition selection rules in the experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of bandwidth renormalization  @xcite renders the lower hubbard band at an energy ( @xmath26  ev ) in reasonable agreement with experiment ( @xmath11  ev ) . </S>",

    "<S> as we show below , in the calculations with oxygen vacancies the value used for @xmath38 facilitates the visualization of the contributions from the hubbard and localized states to the incoherent peak at @xmath40  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the removal of oxygen atoms in the system leads to the donation of two electrons per oxygen to its surrounding . already at the level of density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) ( see supplemental material ) , we find that most of the charge coming from the additional electrons is transferred to the @xmath41 orbitals of the neighboring v atom , developing into a sharp peak of @xmath14 symmetry located around @xmath28  ev , _ </S>",

    "<S> . in analogy to the experimental average over many lattice sites , note that averaging among various supercells with different oxygen vacancy locations and concentrations ( what is beyond the scope of the present work ) would result in a wider in - gap @xmath14 band , as demonstrated for the case of srtio@xmath0 see fig . 3 of ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> by including electronic correlations within ( bandwidth renormalized ) lda+dmft we then see that all the experimental observations qualitatively emerge . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the conducting @xmath8 orbitals develop a lower hubbard band peaked at energies about @xmath29  ev ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2vac_dft_dmft](b ) and ( d ) ) similar to the bulk case without oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , this lower hubbard satellite does not increase in amplitude with the introduction of vacancies , but rather broadens . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the oxygen - vacancy defect states situated at about @xmath42  ev remain qualitatively unchanged by the correlation effects , but experience a broadening with respect to the pure lda case . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the photoemission data , evidencing that the increase in intensity of the in - gap state in the oxygen - deficient srvo@xmath0 is not to be attributed to an increase in population of the lower hubbard satellite , but instead to the manifestation of vacancy states of @xmath14 character . in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a detailed study of the effects of oxygen vacancies in the spectroscopy of the archetypal strongly correlated electron system srvo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that oxygen vacancy states , which are created by uv / x - ray irradiation , occur at energies close to the hubbard satellite . </S>",
