    "in this theoretical study we model the occurrence frequency distributions and associated correlations of parameters observed in solar flare hard x - rays ( paper i ; aschwanden 2010a ) using the concept of self - organized criticality ( for a recent textbook , see aschwanden , 2010b ) .",
    "the concept of self - organized criticality ( soc ) has been pioneered by bak , tang , and wiesenfeld ( 1987 ) , which they briefly summarize in their abstract : `` we show that certain extended dissipative dynamical systems naturally evolve into a critical state , with no characteristic time or length scales .",
    "the temporal `` fingerprint '' of the self - organized critical state is the presence of 1/f noise ; its spatial signature is the emergence of scale - invariant ( fractal ) structure . ''",
    "a consequence of the scale - invariant structure is the manifestation of powerlaw - like distributions of spatial , temporal , and energy parameters , which became the observational hallmark of soc processes .",
    "an interpretation of the omnipresent powerlaw distributions of solar - flare peak fluxes or energies in terms of soc models was first proposed by lu and hamilton ( 1991 ) , which they summarize as follows : `` the solar coronal magnetic field is proposed to be in a self - organized critical state , thus explaining the observed power - law dependence of solar - flare - occurrence rate on flare size which extends over more than five orders of magnitude in peak flux .",
    "the physical picture that arises is that solar flares are avalanches of many small reconnection events , analogous to avalanches of sand in the models published by bak and colleagues in 1987 and 1988 .",
    "flares of all sizes are manifestations of the same physical processes , where the size of a given flare is determined by the number of elementary reconnection events .",
    "the relation between small - scale processes and the statistics of global - flare properties which follows from the self - organized magnetic - field configuration provides a way to learn about the physics of the unobservable small - scale reconnection processes .",
    "a simple lattice - reconnection model is presented which is consistent with the observed flare statistics . ''",
    "the lattice - based computer simulations of next - neighbor interactions is known as _ cellular automaton model _ and represents a powerful numerical model that can reproduce many observed distributions of soc processes ( , see review by charbonneau 2001 ) .",
    "an alternative approach to cellular automaton models of soc processes are analytical models , which also can reproduce the observed statistical distributions and scaling laws between observed parameters , which we pursue here .",
    "a simple analytical model of soc processes with universal applicability can be constructed from the concept of a nonlinear process that : ( i ) has a multiplicative or exponential growth phase , ( ii ) is randomly interrupted , and ( iii ) has a linear decay phase .",
    "the basic evolution of such a dissipative nonlinear process with avalanche - like characteristics is depicted in figure 1 .    the exponential - growth model with conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , which constrains a powerlaw distribution of event sizes , goes back to willis and yule ( 1922 ) , who applied it to geographical distributions of plants and animals .",
    "according to simkin and roychowdhury ( 2006 ) , yule s model was re - invented by fermi ( 1949 ) , who applied it to the origin of cosmic rays , and by huberman and adamic ( 1999 ) , who applied it to the growth dynamics of the world - wide web . in the astrophysical context , it was applied to cosmic ray and solar flare transients by rosner and vaiana ( 1978 ) .",
    "however , the waiting time between subsequent events was interpreted as energy storage time of the exponential energy build - up phase in the model of rosner and vaiana ( 1978 ) , which was not confirmed observationally ( lu , 1995 ; crosby , 1996 ; wheatland , 2000 ; georgoulis 2001 ) . the lack of a correlation between waiting times and flare size is not surprising in the concept of soc models .",
    "the original soc model of bak ( 1987 ) assumes that avalanches occur randomly in time and space without any correlation , and thus a waiting time interval between two subsequent avalanches refers to two different and independent locations ( except for sympathetic flares ) , and thus bears no information on the amount of energy that is released in each spatially separated avalanche . in an alternative model , the exponential rise time @xmath0",
    "is assumed to be related directly to the energy release process of an instability during a flare ( aschwanden 1998 ) , rather than to the much longer energy storage time assumed in rosner and vaiana ( 1978 ) .    for the decay process of the instability ,",
    "a linear decay is found approximately to reproduce the observed scaling laws between flare peak counts and flare durations ( aschwanden 2010b ) , which constitutes assumption ( iii ) of our analytical model .",
    "the physical implication of a linear decay is a constant decay rate after the saturation of the instability , independent of the size of the event .",
    "this linear decay assumption ( iii ) has been added to our model mostly on empirical grounds .",
    "tests with cellular automaton models could corroborate its reality .    ) with exponential growth of the energy release @xmath1 from a threshold level @xmath2 to the saturation level @xmath3 , and ( ii ) a decay time ( @xmath4 ) with a constant decay rate @xmath5.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    let us now formulate this analytical soc model in mathematical terms .",
    "a full derivation of the exponential - growth model is given in section 3.1 of aschwanden ( 2010b ) .",
    "we define the temporal evolution of the energy release rate @xmath1 of a nonlinear process that starts at a threshold energy of @xmath2 with an exponential growth time @xmath6 .",
    "the process grows exponentially until it saturates at time @xmath7 with a saturation energy @xmath3 , @xmath8 we define a peak energy release rate @xmath9 that represents the maximum energy release rate @xmath3 , after subtraction of the threshold energy @xmath2 , @xmath10 \\ .",
    "\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] for the saturation times @xmath0 , which we also call `` rise times '' , we assume a random probability distribution , approximated by an exponential function @xmath11 with e - folding time constant @xmath12 , @xmath13 this probability distribution is normalized to the total number of events , @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting frequency distribution of peak energies , @xmath15 , is then , @xmath16 \\left| { d t_s \\over dp } \\right| dp =      { n_0 ( \\alpha_p - 1 ) \\over w_0 }       \\left({p \\over w_0 } + 1 \\right)^{-\\alpha_p } \\ dp \\ ,      \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] which is an exact powerlaw distribution for large peak energies ( @xmath17 ) with a powerlaw slope @xmath18 of @xmath19 the powerlaw slope thus depends on the ratio of the e - folding saturation time @xmath12 to the exponential growth time constant @xmath6 , which is essentially the average number of growth times .",
    "once an instability has released a maximum amount @xmath3 of energy , say when an avalanche reaches its largest velocity on a sandpile , the energy release gradually slows down until the avalanche comes to rest .",
    "for sake of simplicity we assume a constant energy decay rate @xmath20 after the peak of the energy release , lasting for a time interval @xmath4 until it drops to the threshold level @xmath2 , @xmath21 which produces a linear decay of the released energy , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the end time of the process at @xmath24 .",
    "the time interval @xmath4 of the energy decay thus depends on the peak energy release rate @xmath9 .",
    "the time interval @xmath25 of the total duration of the avalanche process is the sum of the exponential rise phase @xmath0 and the linear decay phase @xmath4 as illustrated in figure 1 , @xmath26 we see that this relationship predicts an approximate proportionality of @xmath27 for large avalanches , since the second term , which is linear in @xmath9 , becomes far greater than the first term with a logarithmic dependence ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the resulting distribution of flare durations , @xmath29 , is then approximately ( neglecting the rise time ) , @xmath30 \\left| { d\\tau \\over dt } \\right| dt       \\approx { n_0 ( \\alpha_p - 1 ) \\over \\tau_d }      \\left ( { t \\over \\tau_d } + 1 \\right)^{-\\alpha_t } \\ ,      \\eqno(9)\\ ] ] which is a powerlaw function for large durations @xmath25 with the same slope @xmath31 as the peak energy rate @xmath9 .",
    "the total released energy @xmath32 is the time integral of the energy release rate @xmath1 during the event duration @xmath25 . neglecting the rise time @xmath0 and subtracting the threshold level @xmath2 before the avalanche , we obtain @xmath33 \\ dt       \\approx \\int_{t_s}^{t_s+d } \\left [ w(t)-w_0 \\right ] \\ dt \\       = { 1\\over 2 } p d       \\ .          \\eqno(10)\\ ] ] yielding a frequency distribution @xmath34 of , @xmath35 \\left| { dp \\over de } \\right| de       \\approx { n_0 ( \\alpha_p - 1 ) \\over 2 e_0 }        \\left [ \\sqrt { { e \\over e_0 } } + 1 \\right]^{-\\alpha_p }      \\left [ { e \\over e_0 } \\right]^{-1/2 } \\ .",

    "we see that this model can accomodate a range of powerlaw slopes in the upper energy range and predicts particular correlations between the three parameters @xmath32 , @xmath9 , and @xmath25 , @xmath39 while the powerlaw slopes are related to each other by @xmath40 how does this basic model compare with the observations of solar flares ?",
    "the frequency distribution that is closest to a perfect powerlaw function is that of the peak counts @xmath9 , which has a slope of @xmath41 ( paper i ; figure 1 ) and thus constrains the ratio of the growth time to the mean saturation time , , @xmath42 . for the slope of flare durations we observed @xmath43 ( paper i ; figure 3 ) , which somewhat disagrees with the theoretical expectation @xmath31 by about 15% . for the slope of total counts we observed @xmath44 ( paper i ; figure 2 ) , while our model predicts @xmath45 , deviating by about 15% .",
    "the model implies also a sharp correlation between the parameters @xmath46 , and @xmath25 ( equation 14 ) , which of course is an idealization that is not realistic , as the scatterplots between the parameters demonstrate in figure 4 ( of paper i ) .",
    "a more realistic model can be constructed by introducing a distribution of values for the instability threshold level @xmath2 and the decay time constant @xmath47 , which are assumed to be constant ( or @xmath48-functions ) in our basic model .",

    "the detailed relationship between magnetic complexity and multiplicative chain reactions that occur in a soc system depends on specific physical models such as magnetic reconnection scenarios . in terms of our analytical soc model ,",
    "the powerlaw slope of flare frequency distributions can be modulated by the ratio of growth to saturation times ( @xmath88 ; eq .  5 ) , which can be driven by longer growth times @xmath6 in magnetically more complex regions during high solar activity periods .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation shows that a variation of the mean instability growth time by 38% is required to induce a modulation of the powerlaw slope by 8% ( figure 5 left ) , as observed during the last three solar cycles ( paper i ) .",
    "a shorter growth rate corresponds to faster nonlinear evolution , which could occur in reconnection regions with higher magnetic stress .",
    "alternatively , the mean threshold energy @xmath51 could be larger in magnetically unstable regions during high solar activity periods .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation shows that a change of the mean threshold energy by 26% can explain the observed powerlaw slope variation of 8% ( figure 5 top ) .",
    "a higher threshold could be obtained by stronger magnetic stressing during the solar cycle maximum .",
    "thus , detailed forward - fitting of our analytical soc model to the observed distributions in various active regions and in specific time intervals of the solar cycle could diagnose the physical conditions of magnetic configurations , which provides important information for statistical flare forecasting .",
