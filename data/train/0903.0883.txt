    "with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , particle physics enters a new era of potential discovery , one which may provide insights into the many puzzles of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "given the immense challenges of hadron collider physics , and the degree to which the future of particle physics rests on the lhc , it is important to ensure that the lhc community is fully prepared for whatever might appear in the data .",
    "this requires consideration of a wide variety of models and signatures in advance of the experimental program .",
    "there are a number of reasonable and motivated solutions to the hierarchy problem , the most favored being supersymmetry ( susy ) , with others including the little higgs , warped extra dimensions and technicolor .",
    "most experimental studies of these ideas have focused on `` minimal '' models .",
    "but unlike supersymmetry or the little higgs , _ minimality _ does not by itself solve any particle physics problem .",
    "instead , it is motivated by theorists philosophical attachment to beauty and elegance .",
    "given our experience with the standard model , whose third generation and neutral currents were not viewed as well - motivated before they were discovered , it is prudent that we examine non - minimal models as well , to ensure that their signatures would not be missed at the lhc .",
    "this is especially important because a small addition to a theory can lead to a large change in its lhc phenomenology .",
    "one likely possibility for new non - minimal physics involves the presence of a hidden sector with tev - scale couplings to the standard model .",
    "a large fraction of these models fall within the `` hidden valley scenario '' @xcite . in the hidden valley scenario , a new hidden sector (",
    "the `` hidden valley sector '' , or `` v - sector '' for short ) is coupled to the sm in some way at or near the tev scale , and the v - sector s dynamics generates a mass gap .",
    "such a mass gap , independent of the dynamics leading to that gap , ensures that there are particles that are stable or metastable within the v - sector .",
    "these can only decay , if at all , via their very weak interactions with the sm .",
    "processes that access the hidden valley are often quite unusual compared to those in minimal supersymmetric or other well - studied models .",
    "production of v - sector particles commonly leads to final states with a high multiplicity of sm particles .",
    "also , a hidden valley often leads to particles that decay with macroscopic decay distances .",
    "the resulting phenomenological signatures can be difficult , or at least subtle , for detection at the tevatron or lhc ; see for example @xcite .",
    "hidden valleys have arisen in bottom - up models such as the twin - higgs and folded - supersymmetry models @xcite that attempt to address the hierarchy problem , and in a recent attempt to explain the various anomalies in dark - matter searches @xcite which requires a dark sector with a new force and a 1 gev mass scale .",
    "they are also motivated by top - down model building : hidden sectors that are candidate hidden valleys arise in many string theory models , see for example @xcite . in recent years string theorists have found many models that apparently have the minimal supersymmetric standard model as the chiral matter of the theory , but which typically have extra vector - like matter and extra gauge groups .",
    "the non - minimal particles and forces which arise in these various models may very well be visible at the lhc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a hidden valley that at low energy is a pure - yang - mills theory , a theory that has its own gluons ( `` v - gluons '' ) and their bound states ( `` v - glueballs '' ) .",
    "this scenario easily arises in models ; for example , in many supersymmetric v - sectors , supersymmetry breaking and associated scalar expectation values may lead to large masses for all matter fields .",
    "the spectrum of stable bound states in a pure yang - mills theory is known , to a degree , from lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of such states for an @xmath2 gauge group is shown in figure [ fig spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum includes many glueballs of mass of order the confinement scale @xmath3 ( actually somewhat larger ) , and various @xmath4 quantum numbers .",
    "all of the states shown are stable against decay to the other states , due to kinematics and/or conserved quantum numbers .",
    "= 3.5 in    in this paper we will further specialize to the case where the coupling between the sm sector and the v - sector occurs through a multiplet of massive particles ( which we will call @xmath5 ) charged under both sm - sector and v - sector gauge groups .",
    "a loop of @xmath5 particles induces dimension-@xmath6 operators of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the heavy particle in the loop .",
    "here we have split the dimension-@xmath6 operator @xmath9 into a standard - model part @xmath10 of dimension @xmath11 and a hidden - valley part @xmath12 of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "all v - glueball states can decay through these operators .    by simple dimensional analysis ,",
    "these operators yield partial decay widths of order @xmath14 .",
    "we will see that the v - glueball decays are dominated by @xmath15 operators .",
    "the next operators have @xmath16 , and their effects are typically suppressed by @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath15 operators induce lifetimes for the v - glueballs of order @xmath18 , which can range anywhere from @xmath19 seconds to much longer than a second , depending on the parameters .",
    "implicitly our focus is on the case where the lifetimes are short enough that at least a few decays can be observed in an lhc detector .",
    "this typically requires lifetimes shorter than a micro - second , if the production cross - section is substantial .",
    "however , our formulas will be valid outside this regime as well .",
    "we will need to construct the @xmath15 effective action coupling the two sectors .",
    "then we will use it to compute formulas for the partial widths of various decay modes of the v - glueballs , concentrating on the lighter v - glueball states , which we expect to be produced most frequently .",
    "application of our formulas , particularly as relevant for the lhc , will be carried out in a second paper @xcite . to put the present paper in context",
    ", we now briefly review the results to be presented there . although there are some irreducible uncertainties due to unknown glueball transition matrix elements and decay constants , we find that the various v - glueball states have lifetimes that probably span 3 or 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "we also find that the dominant v - glueball decays are to sm gauge - boson pairs , or radiative decays to another v - glueball and a photon ( or perhaps a @xmath20 boson . )",
    "we will demonstrate that detection should be straightforward , if the mass @xmath8 of the quirk @xmath5 is small enough to give a reasonable cross - section , and @xmath3 is large enough to ensure the v - glueballs decay promptly .",
    "several v - glueballs form di - photon resonances , which should be easy to detect if their decays are prompt .",
    "unlike @xcite , or especially @xcite , it appears that traditional cut - based analysis on ordinary events with jets and photons will be sufficient . for displaced decays , however ,",
    "special experimental techniques are always needed .",
    "there are a number of different signatures , and the optimal search strategy is not obvious .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we introduce our model and systematically describe the v - sector operators and the v - glueball states . in sec .  3 , we describe the effective action coupling the two sectors and the sm matrix elements relevant for the decays .",
    "our main results for the decay modes and their branching fractions appear in sec .  4 .",
    "we conclude in sec .  5 with some final comments and perspective .",
    "additional results appear in the appendix .",
    "consider adding to the standard model ( sm ) a new gauge group @xmath21 , with a confinement scale @xmath3 in the 11000 gev range .",
    "we will refer to this sector as the `` hidden valley '' , or the `` v - sector '' following @xcite .",
    "what makes this particular confining hidden valley special is that it has no light charged matter ; its only light fields are its gauge bosons , which we will call `` hidden gluons '' or `` v - gluons '' . at low energy , confinement generates ( meta)stable bound states , `` v - glueballs '' , from the v - gluons . the sm is coupled to the hidden valley sector only through heavy fields @xmath22 , in vector - like representations of both the sm and @xmath21 , with masses of order the tev scale .",
    "these states can be produced directly at the lhc , but because of v - confinement they can not escape each other ; they form a bound state which relaxes toward the ground state and eventually annihilates .",
    "the products of the annihilation are often v - glueballs .",
    "( other annihilations lead typically to a hard pair or trio of standard model particles . ) thereafter , the v - glueballs decay , giving a potentially visible signal .    for definiteness , we take the gauge group @xmath21 to be @xmath23 , and the particles @xmath22 to transform as a fundamental representation of @xmath23 and in complete @xmath24 representations of the standard model , typically @xmath25 and/or @xmath26 .",

    "the approximate global @xmath24 symmetry of the sm gauge couplings suggests that the masses @xmath35 and @xmath56 should be roughly of the same order of magnitude , and similarly for the masses @xmath57 .",
    "it is often more convenient to express the answer as a function of the ( partially redundant ) dimensionless parameters @xmath58 here @xmath8 is a mass scale that can be chosen arbitrarily ; depending on parameters , it is usually most natural to take it to be the mass of the lightest @xmath22 particle .    integrating out these heavy particles generates an effective lagrangian  that couples the v - gluons and the sm gauge bosons .",
    "the terms in the effective lagrangian are of the form ( [ loop terms ] ) , with operators @xmath12 constructed from the gauge invariant combinations , where @xmath59 denote the generators of the @xmath23 algebra with a common normalization @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 , contracted according to different irreducible representations of the lorentz group .",
    "the interactions in the effective action then allow the v - glueballs in figure  [ fig spectrum ] , which can not decay within the v - sector , to decay to final states containing sm particles and at most one v - glueball .",
    "this is analogous to the way that the fermi effective theory , which couples the quark sector to the lepton sector , permits otherwise stable qcd hadrons to decay weakly to the lepton sector . as is also true for leptonic and semileptonic decays of qcd hadrons , our calculations for v - hadrons decaying into sm particles simplify because of the factorization of the matrix elements into a purely sm part and a purely hidden - sector part . to compute the v - glueball decays",

    "qualitatively , if the colored @xmath5 particles are very heavy and @xmath379 is very small , radiative decays will probably dominate , while tight degeneracies within the @xmath5 multiplet(s ) could suppress @xmath206 and reverse the situation .",
    "but quantitative prediction seems impossible .",
    "let us first summarize our results and their immediate implications .",
    "* we have seen that annihilation decays dominate those states that can be created by dimension @xmath72 operators ( the @xmath380 and @xmath381 ) .",
    "their branching fractions are dominated by decays to @xmath280 , with decays to @xmath281 having a branching fraction of @xmath382 , assuming the @xmath5 fields form complete @xmath24 multiplets of equal mass .",
    "if the colored @xmath5 particles are much heavier than the uncolored ones , then decays to electroweak bosons can dominate .",
    "* most other states decay by radiatively emitting a photon , or ( at a rate that is at most @xmath383 compared to photon emission ) a @xmath20 boson . *",
    "the @xmath110 is a special case ; it typically prefers to decay radiatively but has a non - negligible annihilation decay to an off - shell @xmath196 or @xmath20 . *",
    "the @xmath264 is also special ; three - body decays to gluons plus a @xmath71-even v - glueball could be of the same order or even dominate over radiative decays to the @xmath71-odd sector .",
    "* in all , we expect the final states from v - glueball production to be rich in jets and stray photons , with occasional photon pairs , leptons and some missing energy from neutrinos .",
    "the two - photon resonances from the annihilation decays of @xmath71-even v - glueballs are likely to be the discovery signatures , along with the @xmath384 and @xmath385 resonances from cascade decays of @xmath71-odd v - glueballs . * depending on the parameters , the lifetime of any given state can vary over many orders of magnitude .",
    "but for any fixed choice of parameters , lifetimes of the v - glueballs vary over at least three or four orders of magnitude , the details depending on unknown v - glueball matrix elements and mass ratios , as well as the @xmath5 mass spectrum . displaced vertices can potentially serve as a discovery channel .",
    "* there are several opportunities for discovery of this signal in displaced vertices .",
    "one option arises from @xmath280 decays in events triggered by photons , another from @xmath283 decays triggered by the muon or electron in a leptonic @xmath195 decay , and a third from photons that arrive late or ( if converted ) point away from the primary vertex .",
    "our results are robust , but some cautionary and clarifying remarks are in order . clearly , numerical application of our formulas is currently subject to considerable uncertainties , due especially to the many unknown matrix elements that arise , and due also to the unknown spectrum for gauge groups other than @xmath2 .",
    "of course these uncertainties are largely reducible through additional lattice gauge theory computations , should a discovery of a sector of this type be made .",
    "however , there are other potential subtleties to keep in mind .",
    "if the @xmath5 fields and the v - glueball states have comparable masses , then mixing between these states can not be neglected .",
    "this could lead to additional physical effects that we have not considered .",
    "we also remind the reader that we have worked at leading non - vanishing order and that higher - order corrections are not negligible when precise predictions are required .    a more qualitative uncertainty , and an interesting opportunity , arises from the gauge group . for @xmath328 , @xmath386 ,",
    "it is anticipated that the glueball spectrum is similar to that of @xmath2 , as calculated by @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath28 spectrum , and more generally that of any @xmath387 or @xmath388 gauge group , has no @xmath71-odd sector .",
    "the operators @xmath389 do not exist , as they are built from the @xmath390 symbol absent from such groups , and the corresponding @xmath71-odd states are also absent .",
    "for @xmath391 the situation is more subtle .",
    "the first cases are @xmath392 , which is not simple and has two sets of @xmath28 v - glueballs , and @xmath393 , which is the same as @xmath271 .",
    "the @xmath253 @xmath389 operators are present for @xmath393 , but for general @xmath391 the @xmath389 operators become pfaffian operators of dimension @xmath394 , built from a single epsilon symbol and @xmath273 field strengths . as suggested by  @xcite and as verified by  @xcite , there is a correlation in the qcd spectrum and in the glueball spectrum between the dimension of an operator and the mass of the lightest corresponding state .",
    "for this reason we expect that for a pure @xmath391 gauge theory with @xmath274 , the @xmath71-odd states are heavier than in figure  [ fig spectrum ] relative to the @xmath71-even states .",
    "their production rate is likely to be quite suppressed as a result , but are still interesting , since several are likely to be unable to decay to other v - glueballs alone , and will be metastable .",
    "certainly the lightest @xmath71-odd state ( probably still the @xmath111 ) can not decay to two or more @xmath71-even v - glueballs , so it will likely decay by radiating a photon or @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the degeneracy of the light @xmath71-odd states seen in @xmath2 may well persist more generally , making these states potentially unable to decay to two v - glueballs in a @xmath71-odd final state , such as @xmath395 .",
    "all of these states will decay therefore to the @xmath71-even sector by radiating a photon ( or @xmath20 ) , except the @xmath110 that may again decay to standard model fermions .",
    "the larger phase space for @xmath274 means the lifetimes may be much shorter than those of the @xmath71-even states , a fact which could be phenomenologically important if @xmath3 and @xmath396 are so small that the @xmath71-even states are unobservably long - lived .",
    "thus study of the spectrum of the v - glueballs may provide some information on the gauge group .",
    "combined with some partial information about the @xmath5 production rate and the branching fractions of @xmath397 annihilations , it may well be possible to identify the gauge group precisely .    finally , we have assumed here that the v - glueballs are the low - energy degrees of freedom of an asymptotically weakly - coupled gauge theory .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite allows us to learn what one might observe if the theory has a large t hooft coupling in the ultraviolet .",
    "in particular , the low - lying glueballs of such a theory can be described as modes of a string theory on a 10-dimensional space compactified to 5 dimensions .",
    "such a theory @xcite will have light scalars , pseudoscalars , tensors , etc . , but will not have any light @xmath103 state .",
    "apparently the mass of this state may serve as a crude probe of the size of the ultraviolet t hooft coupling , as long as its mass is not so high as to render the state unstable to decay to lighter glueballs .",
    "our formulas now permit a variety of phenomenological studies .",
    "the issue of lhc searches will be considered in @xcite .",
    "we thank y.  gershtein , c.  j.  morningstar , a.  yu .  morozov , m.  e.  peskin , m.  shifman and a.  vainshtein for conversations .",
    "this work was supported in part by the department of energy grant de - fg02 - 96er40949 .",
    "the work of d.m . was also partly supported by the rfbr grant 07 - 02 - 01161 , the grant for support of scientific schools nsh-3035.2008.2 , the center of excellence supported by the israel science foundation ( grant no .",
    "1468/06 ) , the grant dip h52 of the german israel project cooperation , the bsf united - states - israel binational science foundation grant 2006157 and the german israel foundation ( gif ) grant no . 962 - 94.7/2007 .",
    "in the main body of the text we have argued that three - body decays of states in the @xmath71-odd sector are largely suppressed as compared to their radiative decays to light @xmath71-even states . as an example , here we consider a three - body decay @xmath398 and demonstrate that there is a substantial suppression of its rate .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to consider the case of the s - wave decay mode since this is expected to give the highest contribution to the decay rate in a partial wave expansion . in this approximation only @xmath70 and @xmath138 operators contribute ( table  [ dim4 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the amplitude @xmath399,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the s - wave approximation implies the following form of the matrix elements ; 1^+-| p|1^= * m_1^1^+-^p * , @xmath400 the above amplitude gives a decay rate @xmath401 where we define the dimensionless functions @xmath402 and @xmath403 of @xmath404 as @xmath405 @xmath406 for the values of v - glueball masses from the spectrum in figure  [ fig spectrum ] , @xmath407 , @xmath408 and @xmath409 .",
    "unless there is an extreme degeneracy in the @xmath24 multiplet of @xmath5 particles , which is unnatural due to @xmath24-asymmetric renormalization of the masses , we expect @xmath206 is at least of order @xmath410 , so the coefficient in front of the ratio of the form - factors will be around @xmath411 or smaller .    for other states in the @xmath71-odd sector ,",
    "a rough estimate confirms that the ratio of the three - body decays to the radiative decays is never greater than @xmath412 and is typically much smaller .",
    "thus , we conclude that the three - body decays in this sector are never dominant .",
    "since most such decays are to gluons , and are therefore very difficult to observe , the three - body processes can for current purposes be ignored .",
