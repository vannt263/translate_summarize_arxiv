    "special spatio - temporal patterns of the electric potential like spiral waves , mother waves or ectopic foci are thought to be underlying generating mechanisms of af @xcite .",
    "these patterns are often located near physiologically modified regions of the heart tissue in the left atrium @xcite .",
    "the question hence arises , how these physiologically modified regions can be responsible for the generation of spiral waves or ectopic foci and how they influence the properties of these patterns .    to tackle these questions , we study generating mechanism for af on the basis of the fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite , which is a simple model for action potential generation and propagation . by modeling physiologically modified regions using a spatial variation of the parameters characterizing cell properties like excitability or resting state stability",
    ", we calculate phase diagrams , which specify the type of spatio - temporal excitation pattern in dependence of the extent of the modified region and the strength of the modification . thereupon we investigate how self - excitatory sources as spiral waves or ectopic foci with rather regular dynamics in one region can induce irregular , fibrillatory excitation patterns in some other region .",
    "irregular , fibrillatory states are often observed in the right atrium @xcite and it was conjectured that these are caused by the perturbation of regular waves generated by the sinus node by waves emanating from an additional pacemaker like a spiral wave or ectopic foci in the left atrium .",
    "the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) equations @xcite are a set of two coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations , which describe excitable media via an inhibitor - activator mechanism .",

    "we will use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fhn ] ) in their original context as a model to investigate the spatio - temporal evolution of electric excitations in the heart . in this approach the variable @xmath1",

    "the influence of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be inferred by numerical solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fhn ] ) without the diffusive term .",
    "the parameter values have to be limited to some range in order to generate excitability , and their detailed effect on the pulses is complicated due to mutual interdependencies originating from the nonlinearity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fhn ] ) . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath7 affects the length of the refractory period , @xmath8 influences the stability of the resting state , and @xmath9 controls the excitability and strength of the cells response to a stimulus . to capture the propagation and form of a typical action potential , the following set of parameters",
    "can be used : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "these values will be associated with a `` healthy tissue '' in the following .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the time development of @xmath1 and @xmath2 during an excitation after a stimulus with these parameters .",
    "note that the variable @xmath14 mirrors the form of a pulse in an usual representation of an ecg recording .",
    "ectopic foci and spiral waves are thought to be caused and influenced by physiologically modified regions of the tissue , which in the modeling correspond to spatial variations of the parameters .",
    "to simplify the analysis , we fix @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and consider variations of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 according to @xmath17 where the amplitudes @xmath18 , @xmath19 characterize the strength , and the correlation lengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 characterize the spatial range of modification .",
    "the calculations are carried out on a two - dimensional simulation area of size @xmath22 , which represents an isolated section of atrial heart tissue , as it is used often in experiments @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions of the simulation area are of von neumann type , i.  e.  @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the normal derivative .    to solve the two nonlinear coupled partial differential equations ( [ eq : fhn ] ) we use the finite element method ( fem ) with a triangulation consisting of 4225 nodes and 8192 triangles , and a constant integration time step @xmath25 .",
    "a simulation time of @xmath26 corresponds to a time of roughly @xmath27 to @xmath28 ms .",
    "the nonlinearity @xmath29 in eq .",

    "the transmembrane potential raises without external stimulation until the threshold value is reached and an action potential results . in optical mapping studies and spatially resolved ecg recordings , ectopic foci are often localized in the regions of the pulmonary veins @xcite .    to model a tissue with physiologically modified properties that result in ectopic activity , we fix @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and vary the resting state stability @xmath8 around the center of the simulation area ( @xmath34 ) according to eq .",

    ", we calculate a phase diagram , where in dependence of @xmath20 and @xmath18 regions of ectopic activity can be distinguished from that without self - excitatory behavior .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b show that there exists a minimal @xmath40 , below which no ectopic activity occurs .",
    "the corresponding value @xmath41 is the critical value of resting state stability in the fhn equations  ( [ eq : fhn ] ) in the absence of the diffusion term . for fixed @xmath42 the ectopic activity vanishes , when @xmath20 falls below the dashed transition line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b . in this region",
    "the diffusive current from the modified tissue to the surrounding causes the initial decrease of @xmath1 to become so slow , that the counter - regulation by @xmath2 eventually hinders @xmath1 to reach its activation threshold , cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . only small oscillation of @xmath1 around a reduced resting state value can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , which become weaker with growing time .",
    "the temporal - spatial pattern of the activation in the phase of ectopic activity is characterized by the frequency of the ectopic focus .",
    "we calculate this frequency as the inverse mean time interval between consecutive action potentials . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the frequency becomes larger with increasing @xmath18 ( at fixed @xmath20 ) and @xmath20 ( at fixed @xmath18 ) , and it tends to saturate for large @xmath20 . with increasing @xmath20 ,",
    "the diffusive current of the inner cells of the modified tissue decreases and thus a larger frequency is obtained . in the saturation limit the frequency is nearly the same as in the absence of diffusion and thus is mainly determined by the refractory period .",
    "in this section we study the influence of physiologically modified regions , called `` obstacles '' henceforth , on spiral wave behavior .",
    "it was observed that spiral waves in the atria can be generated by a perturbation of the propagation of planar excitation waves by anatomic obstacles as , for example , the pulmonary veins , the venae cavae , the pectinate muscle bundles or some localized region of modified tissue @xcite .",
    "these regions are considered as not fully excitable and are thus modeled as regions with a reduced parameter @xmath9 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : obstacle c ] ) .    in an experiment by ikeda and coworkers @xcite a nearly rectangular area of atrial tissue was placed on an electrode plaque in a tissue bath .",
    "holes with different diameters were created and a reentrant wave was initiated by cross - field stimulation .",
    "the resulting behavior of the wavefront was , amongst others , classified according to whether the spiral is anchored by the obstacle , and by the relationship between hole size and cycle length of the reentry .",
    "it was observed that for large obstacle sizes ( 6 , 8 and 10 mm ) , the reentrant wave attaches to the obstacle , leading to a linear increase of the cycle length with the hole diameter . for small obstacle diameters below about 4  mm , by contrast , meandering spirals with a tip getting variably closer to or further away from the hole were found . in this case",
    "the cycle length becomes independent of the hole diameter .",
    "similar results were observed by lim and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the behavior of spiral waves near holes with diameters ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath44  mm and obtained a higher attachment rate for larger obstacle diameters as well as a positive linear correlation of the reentry conduction velocity and wave length with the obstacle diameter in the case of attached spirals for smaller obstacle diameters the spiral waves were found to attach to and detach from the obstacle .",
    "the missing anchoring for small hole sizes was explained in @xcite by invoking a `` source - sink relationship '' .",
    "the `` source '' is the activation wavefront and provides a diffusive current to the surrounding tissue in the resting state , which constitutes the `` sink '' . the sink becomes larger for smaller obstacles , where more cells become depolarized by the activation wavefront .",
    "if the source - to - sink ratio is decreased below a certain critical value , the wavefront detaches from the obstacle .    to elucidate these experimental findings , we perform numerical calculations for a geometry corresponding to the experiments with the following initial state and parameters settings : the modified region , is , as in the previous sec .",
    "[ subsec : ea ] , placed in the center of the simulation area at @xmath34 .",
    "initially a `` planar '' ( linear ) wave is generated by inducing a current @xmath6 in the stripe @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and by setting the area @xmath47 , @xmath48 into a refractory state with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , while the rest of the simulation area is in the resting state ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "this initial state resembles the activation pattern directly after application of a cross - field or paired - pulse stimulation ( two rectangular pulses ) . at the `` upper part '' of the initial planar wavefront ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , diffusive currents flow `` radially '' in all forward directions ( @xmath53 ) , while at the `` right boundary '' ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) the diffusive currents can flow only in positive @xmath56 direction ( due to the refractory state in the area @xmath57 , @xmath58 )",
    "this higher loss by diffusion leads to a smaller propagation speed of the initial wavefront at its upper boundary compared to its right boundary . as a consequence ,",
    "the wavefront becomes curved , and a reentrant spiral wave develops for all reductions @xmath19 in excitability and obstacle sizes @xmath21 , in accordance with the experimental observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows activation patterns for @xmath59 and a ) @xmath60 , and b ) @xmath61 . the stronger reduction of excitability in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]a leads to an anchoring of the spiral wave , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]b the spiral is meandering .    to analyze the parameter regimes of the occurrence of anchored or meandering spiral waves",
    ", we perform a frequency analysis for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we determine the peak positions in the time series of @xmath1 at @xmath62 positions far away from the center of the spiral and calculate the peak - to - peak intervals .",
    "the frequency of one point is one over the mean of the peak - to - peak intervals and the mean cycle length is one over the average of all these local frequencies .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] show that , as in the experiments , attached spiral waves occur for large @xmath63 and for sufficiently large @xmath64 , where @xmath65 decreases with increasing @xmath19 . for these anchored spirals ,",
    "the frequency is proportional to @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the conduction velocity in the fhn model .",
    "accordingly , @xmath68 increases linearly with @xmath21 for @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . for small @xmath69 , only meandering spirals are observed .",
    "the transition from large to small @xmath19 reflects the transition from anatomical to functional reentry @xcite , as it has been reported in medical studies @xcite .",
    "the fact that for small @xmath21 always meandering spirals occur , can be interpreted by the small source - sink ratio @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism can also lead to meandering spirals for large @xmath21 if @xmath19 becomes small .",
    "note , that nevertheless the spiral wave is not anchored to the obstacle , its movement is still influenced by the obstacle .",
    "in previous studies on interactions of paced waves with self - excitatory waves , the influence of the pacing on a spiral wave was studied @xcite with the aim to suggest a possible therapy to suppress fibrillation or tachycardia .",
    "the pacing was applied to the region , where the spiral wave was located .",
    "it was found that the pacing leads to an annihilation of the reentrant activity or to a shift of the spiral core @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate the perturbation of regular paced waves from a source representing the sinus node by waves emanating from an additional pacemaker located in a distant region .",
    "electrocardiogram recordings and their frequency analyses show that regular excitation patterns are often observed in the left atrium , where additional pacemakers like spiral waves or ectopic foci are located @xcite , and that at the same time irregular , fibrillatory - like states in the right atrium occur @xcite .",
    "this led to the conjecture that fibrillatory states can be induced in the right atrium by self - excitatory pacemakers in the left atrium . in this connection it is important to better understand how a fibrillatory state can occur ,",
    "if regular paced waves , as generated by the sinus node , are disturbed by additional pacemaker waves . to this end",
    ", we consider the waves to be located in spatially separated regions that are connected by a small region . to be specific , we choose a simulation area of size @xmath70 , which is divided into three regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "the rectangular area l with @xmath71 , @xmath72 representing the left atrium , the rectangular area r with @xmath73 , @xmath72 representing the right atrium , and the small bridge b with @xmath74 , @xmath75 representing the connection between the atria .",
    "the grid used in the finite element calculations consists of in total 8871 nodes and 17350 triangles .",
    "we focus on situations where the pacemaker in the region l is located far outside the left part of the simulation area , so that the resulting wavefronts become `` planar '' ( linear ) . in the simulation they are generated by application of a stimulating current @xmath76 with duration @xmath77 and a period @xmath78 in the region @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the activation waves representing the pacemaker in region r are generated by the application of a current @xmath76 with duration @xmath81 and period @xmath82 in the region @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the irregularity of the resulting patterns in region r is quantified by calculating the shannon entropy of the distribution of local activation frequencies for every grid point in r. to this end we divide the frequency range into @xmath85 bins of size @xmath86min@xmath87^{-1},0.01 \\right\\rbrace $ ] @xcite and calculate the probabilities @xmath88 of finding frequency @xmath89 in bin @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the total number of grid points .",
    "the normalized entropy then is given by @xmath92 for a single frequency ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 , while for a chaotic activation pattern with a uniform distribution ( @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 .",
    "for small perturbation frequencies ( @xmath97 ) the influence of the activation wavefronts from the additional pacemaker onto the sinus node waves is almost negligible .",
    "small deformations of the linear wavefronts are observed , but the measured frequencies are close to the pacing frequency , and the overall spatiotemporal pattern in r is regular",
    ".    with increasing perturbation frequency the spatiotemporal pattern in region r becomes more irregular and a breakup of the regularly paced waves can occur .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8 ] shows the time evolution of the excitation patterns for a perturbation frequency @xmath98 and a pacing frequency @xmath99 . for small times , the waves are only slightly perturbed and the pattern remains regular , as can be seen from the four consecutive snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]a . at a later time , however , the perturbation by the waves from region l results in a breakup of the waves close to the bridge b in region r , as can be seen from the four consecutive snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]b .",
    "the onset of this breakup was found to occur at a time @xmath100 .    in order to investigate",
    "how the spatial irregularity is reflected in the time evolution , we consider three different points @xmath101 and @xmath102 in region r. the time evolution of @xmath1 for these three points is shown for two different perturbation frequencies @xmath103 and @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ( @xmath105 : black solid curve , @xmath106 : red dashed curve , @xmath107 : blue dash - dotted curve ) . for the lower frequency @xmath108 the evolution at all three points is regular , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9]a . for the higher frequency @xmath109 , by contrast , the break ups of the waves seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]b yield unsuccessful activations during refractory periods , as can be seen , for example , at time @xmath110 in point p@xmath111 ( red dashed curve ) and at time @xmath112 in point p@xmath113 ( black solid curve ) .",
    "these unsuccessful activations are caused by a rapid pacing of the region by the curled wave .",
    "another feature is that the shape of the action potential varies .",
    "this can be seen , for example , at point p@xmath113 ( black solid line ) when comparing the pulses at @xmath100 and @xmath114 .",
    "it is important to note that these irregularities are hardly observed at point p@xmath115 ( blue dash - dotted curve ) , showing that they exhibit a spatial heterogeneity .",
    "the total irregularity in region r quantified by the normalized shannon entropy @xmath116 of the local frequency distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] as a function of the frequency @xmath117 of the perturbing waves from region l. for small perturbation frequencies @xmath118 the entropy @xmath116 equals the unperturbed case , while for @xmath119 , @xmath116 sharply increases until it reaches a maximum at @xmath120 . for higher @xmath117 a return to more regular activation pattern",
    "is found , indicating that the disturbance is most pronounced if @xmath117 is close to @xmath121 .",
    "to conclude , the disturbance of the wavefronts in region r by waves emanating from an additional source in region l and propagating through the bridge region b can lead to irregular , fibrillatory - like activation patterns in region r. on the other hand , the waves in region l are almost unaffected by the waves in r with primary wavefront orthogonal to the cross section of the bridge .",
    "the irregularities in region r are most pronounced at a certain perturbation frequency @xmath117 .",
    "how this value is influenced by the geometry of the bridge and the parameters characterizing the cell properties remains further investigation .",
    "the influence of physiologically modified regions on the generation and properties of spatio - temporal activation patterns was investigated on the basis of the fitzhugh - nagumo equations with von neumann boundary conditions , in particular the occurrence of ectopic foci and spiral waves under spatial inhomogeneities of the parameters characterizing the cell properties .",
    "it was shown that the reduction @xmath18 of the resting state stability in circular regions of the tissue can lead to ectopic activity .",
    "a minimal size of hyperactive tissue is necessary for ectopic activity to occur , as well as a minimal strength of the reduction of resting state stability with respect to the `` healthy '' reference value . with increasing size @xmath20 of the hyperactive tissue , the frequency of the ectopic focus first increases and eventually saturates .",
    "the saturation frequency depends on the strength of the modification @xmath18 .",
    "for spiral wave patterns it was found that an anchoring of the wave to the obstacle can occur . to uncover this mechanism ,",
    "an obstacle was modeled as a patch of modified tissue with reduced excitability by a reduction of the parameter @xmath9 in the fhn equations .",
    "the obstacle was placed in the middle of a two - dimensional square simulation area and a planar excitation wave was generated aside of the obstacle in front of a refractory region , which represents an activation pattern observed after cross - field stimulation in experiments . as in the experiments , reentrant waves are observed . these exhibit either functional or anatomical reentry in dependence of the obstacle size and reduction strength @xmath19 of excitability .",
    "an analysis of the spiral wave frequency in dependence of the obstacle size yields results in accordance with the experimental observations .",
    "finally we studied the question , if and how fibrillatory - like states can arise in the right atrium due to the presence of self - excitatory spiral waves or ectopic foci in the left atrium . to this end",
    "the simulation area was separated into two rectangular regions l and r connected by a small bridge b. planar excitation waves were generated with different frequencies in the left region l to model a pacemaker far outside the left part of the simulation area .",
    "planar excitation waves resembling stimulation by the sinus node were generated by periodic application of a stimulating current at one boundary in the right part r of the simulation area .",
    "for small perturbation frequencies in l , the disturbance of the waves in r turned out to be small . for higher perturbation frequencies ,",
    "the waves in r become significantly disturbed and the spatio - temporal activation pattern eventually becomes irregular .",
    "the time evolution of the activation variable @xmath1 , representing the electric potential in the fhn equations , shows features in close resemblance to the ones found in intra - atrial electrocardiogram recordings during fibrillation in the right atrium .",
    "the spatial variation of the excitation frequency was quantified in terms of an entropy , which showed , for a given pacing frequency , a maximum as a function of the perturbation frequency .",
    "further investigations will focus on the influence of the geometry of the bridge and the wavefronts as well as analyse the behavior for different pacing frequencies .",
    "the reliability of the measure of irregularity @xmath116 should be analysed and if necessary other methods to characterise the system behavior should be searched .",
