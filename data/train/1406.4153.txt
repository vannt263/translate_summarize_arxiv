    "the catalogue described here is the final product of the survey described in @xcite . originally , the survey was to provide optical support for the tel aviv university uv experiment ( tauvex ; @xcite ) , an israeli uv space telescope , by extending the wavelength base of observations from the uv to the optical part of em spectrum .",
    "tauvex in its last configuration was intended to observe circumpolar sky regions with @xmath4 .",
    "the north celestial cap ( ncc ) with @xmath5 can be observed throughout the entire year from israel .",
    "the ncc was poorly covered by modern ccd - based sky surveys .",
    "one option of an optical counterpart for the tauvex observations in the ncc was the usno - b1.0 ( @xcite ) catalogue , which fully covers the ncc region .",
    "however , it is based on photographic plate scans and suffers from shortcomings of the photographic emulsion ; in particular its photometry is not sufficiently accurate .",
    "@xcite examined the usno - b1.0 photometric data and found systematic errors as high as 0.20 mag and dispersions up to 0.34 mag .",
    "the only modern high - precision sky survey available for the ncc region is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , which is sufficiently deep and photometrically accurate .",
    "the median photometric errors for point sources at the sdss limiting magnitudes ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 mag ) are @xmath8 and @xmath9 mag .",
    "however , sdss covers only @xmath212% of the ncc region .",
    "we originally planned to use the 1-meter telescope of the wise observatory with r and i bands for the ncc survey ( nccs ) . in this form , as an optical two - colour counterpart for the tauvex uv data , the survey was described in @xcite , but it underwent several major changes since then .",
    "the tauvex mission was canceled in 2010 by the israeli and indian space agencies while the nccs optical survey was well underway .",
    "however , the nccs was deemed potentially interesting even lacking the tauvex data .",
    "the galex uv data were used in the project instead of the tauvex uv data , although galex did not cover the entire ncc region .",
    "preliminary results and some prospects of the nccs - galex data combination were described in @xcite .",
    "two more changes , not described in @xcite , must be mentioned here .",
    "first , the r and i data were extended with v - band observations using the c-18 telescope of the wise observatory .",
    "second , the wise all - sky data release became publicly available on march 14 , 2012 .",
    "we planned to match our optical data to some ir catalogue , e.g. , to the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) point source catalogue , but the wise data are deeper ( by @xmath22 mag for the w1 and w2 bands ) and have a longer wavelength coverage in comparison to 2mass , and therefore , the wise ir data were added to the nccs catalogue .",
    "the nccs catalogue , in its final form presented here , is an * optical - uv - ir merged catalogue*. it covers gaps in celestial location , wavelength and time between the major modern sky surveys .",
    "the visibility of the ncc region from the northern hemisphere throughout the entire year allows the nccs data to be used as a pseudo - standard calibration field for deeper and more extensive sky surveys .",
    "the ncc location at intermediate galactic latitudes , about @xmath10 , allows the study of both galactic objects , as well as of extragalactic sources .",
    "the nccs data can be used for a general milky way ( mw ) structure study and 3d mapping , as done , e.g .. , by @xcite using the sdss data .",
    "the nccs galactic latitude span is potentially interesting for the mw thick disk and transition to halo study , such as done by @xcite .",
    "the nccs data might also be helpful for a galactic extinction study using , e.g. , the star counting technique , as done by @xcite , @xcite , etc",
    ". the nccs wide wavelength coverage , from the uv to the ir , can serve a vast range of tasks , e.g. , agn - candidate colour selection .",
    "the nccs comes after the completion of the sdss photometric observations ( dr8 represented the last sdss photometric expansion ) and before the 3@xmath11 steradian survey ( @xcite ) of the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) project data become publicly available .",
    "some scientific implications of the nccs catalogue will be described in subsequent papers . here",
    "we concentrate on technical aspects of the survey - the data acquisition and reduction , the catalogue compilation and its merging with other data sets , and its validation with sdss data .",
    "the procedures of data acquisition and reduction of the optical part of our survey were tested on a @xmath214 deg@xmath12 sky region and were described in @xcite .",
    "the major part of the final pipeline used here is similar to that described in there , with only minor changes .",
    "below , the @xcite description is followed , with emphasis on the changes .",
    "@xcite r and i images were collected with the 1-meter ritchey - chrtien telescope and the large area imager for the wise observatory ( laiwo , @xcite ) .",
    "laiwo is a four - ccd mosaic camera imaging a non - contiguous area of @xmath20.98@xmath130.98 deg@xmath12 at @xmath20.87 arcsec per binned pixel .",
    "each ccd uses four read - out channels , producing 16 image quadrants .",
    "@xcite v - band images were obtained with the 0.46-meter centurion 18 ( c18 ) prime - focus telescope of the wise observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the c18 camera uses a single ccd imaging a contiguous field of view of @xmath21.25@xmath130.83 deg@xmath12 at @xmath21.47 arcsec per pixel .",
    "r and i data were collected on 83 nights , from january 10 , 2009 to may 2 , 2011 .",
    "each night several fields were observed with three 300-sec exposures in r and the same in i , with small @xmath210 arcsec dithering .",
    "the v data were collected on 102 nights from june 24 , 2011 to may 4 , 2012 . to match the r- and i - band survey depth , six v - band 600-sec exposures with @xmath25 arcsec dithering",
    "were obtained for each field .",
    "we preferentially observed fields with a small ( @xmath215 arcmin on average ) overlap , located at the lowest possible airmass ( @xmath14 , preferably ) , aiming also to cover the gaps between the laiwo ccds to ensure 100% sky coverage in all three optical bands in the survey area .",
    "the typical seeing at the wise observatory is @xmath223 arcsec .",
    "the seeing was better than 1.5 arcsec during @xmath28% of the nights .",
    "when the seeing was worse than 3.5 arcsec , the observations were not used for this study .",
    "the data reduction used an automated pipeline written mostly in iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ; @xcite ) , with some integrated modules written in other programming software .",
    "the pipeline processes an entire night directory of raw images at once , extracting objects and adding them to the catalogue .",
    "the laiwo electrical setup ( see @xcite ) produces cross - talk between different read - out channels of the same ccd , resulting in the appearance of ghost images .",
    "the phenomenon is produced for every pixel , but is evident for saturated pixels .",
    "ghost images can be easily confused with real ones or can even merge with the image of a real object , and must be removed by de - ghosting .",
    "the cross - talk coefficients between the different read - out channels are either calculated using images from the same night , or are derived from cross - talk coefficients of neighbouring nights using interpolation .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath20.001 - 0.0001 , are different for different quadrants , but are approximately similar for the same quadrant in different nights .",
    "they do not depend on the filter and do not demonstrate long - period variations .",
    "the ghost images are removed by subtracting each quadrant multiplied by its cross - talk coefficient from the other quadrants .",
    "the de - ghosted images are debiased , dark - subtracted and flat - field - corrected .",
    "three 300-sec laiwo images of the same field taken with the same filter , or six 600-sec c18 images , are registered and median - combined .",
    "assuming that the sky brightness did not change significantly between the exposures , this improves the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the final image and removes random noise , such as dust patterns , cosmic rays , satellite tracks , etc .",
    "the combined science images are then scanned with sourceextractor ( se , @xcite ) , which was set to detect all the sources 2@xmath15 above the noise .",
    "this produces a file with a list of different parameters for all detected sources .",
    "the photometry used to extract sources is @xcite photometry using an elliptic adaptive aperture , the natural choice for the nccs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pixel coordinates of all objects were transformed to j2000.0 @xmath16 using ucac3 ( the third usno ccd astrograph catalogue , @xcite ) objects in the neighbourhood of the field .",
    "the major advantages of using ucac3 are all - sky coverage and high astrometric precision ( 15 to 100 mas ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , ucac3 contains only relatively bright ( r @xmath17 16.3 mag ) objects , and , since laiwo images saturate at r @xmath18 11.5 mag , only a relatively small overlap of @xmath2five magnitudes is available between the two surveys .",
    "the ucac3 coordinates were transformed to ( x , y ) planar coordinates using the middle point of the laiwo array for the r and i images , or the middle point of c18 ccd for the v images as the tangential point .",
    "the ( x , y ) list of the detected sources is matched to the ucac3 ( x , y ) list by minimizing the root - mean - square ( rms ) distance between @xmath2250350 unsaturated sources per ccd using the downhill simplex algorithm ( @xcite ) . the final astrometric solution was obtained using a tangential projection , allowing for distortion along the x and y axes .",
    "the rms distance between the matched nccs points and ucac3 was usually @xmath170.2 arcsec in each coordinate , thus 0.2 arcsec is defined to be the nccs astrometric accuracy in both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the pipeline also normalizes the object full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) by the mode fwhm value of the field .",
    "this relative fwhm value , denoted as @xmath21fwhm , is required for the point / extended source separation .",
    "the pipeline then joins all the se output files from the same night into a night catalogue .",
    "the object magnitudes in the night catalogues are calibrated photometrically using @xcite standard stars observed together with regular survey fields during several nights , or with secondary standards .",
    "the nights with @xcite standard stars were included first in the catalogue .",
    "the following calibrations were derived : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the filter v , r or i , @xmath24 is the object flux in adu per sec , @xmath25 is the object airmass , @xmath26 is the atmospheric extinction coefficient , @xmath27 is the zero point and @xmath28 is the colour - correction term .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are wavelength - dependent and are determined from the observed @xcite standard stars .",
    "the atmospheric extinction coefficient and the zero point depend on observation conditions and may vary from night to night .",
    "the colour - correction term depends primarily on the instrument , particularly on the filter characteristics , and should be constant on all the nights .",
    "the colour - correction terms @xmath29 were estimated using @xcite standard stars for the nights when those standards were observed , and remained constant within the error range from night to night .",
    "their mean values are shown in table [ tab : cc_terms ] ; the small values for the v and r band imply that the filters used here are similar to those used by @xcite ."
