    "this qualitative difference is peculiar to the static case . at finite phonon frequencies",

    "most work on the holstein polaron problem was performed for 1d or isotropic systems .",
    "much less attention is paid to the question how polaron properties in anisotropic materials , e.g. molecular crystals  @xcite , interpolate between the 1d and 3d behaviour . in particular , even polarons in quasi-1d systems , such as in organic conductors like the bechgaard salts , are frequently described by the 1d holstein model , neglecting the possibility of electron motion transverse to a quasi-1d chain . for",
    "zero phonon frequency emin showed  @xcite that already tiny electronic transfer integrals perpendicular to the chain suffice to destabilize a large 1d polaron , resulting in a free electron as in 3d below the self - trapping transition .",
    "this result not only puts the existence of large ( adiabatic ) polarons in real materials in doubt , but also raises the question to which degree polarons in quasi-1d systems can be described as true 1d polarons . in the present work we study to which extent the scenario described for zero phonon frequency translates to finite phonon frequencies beyond the extreme adiabatic regime .",
    "to address this fundamental question , we consider the 3d holstein polaron model with anisotropic hopping @xmath0 here @xmath1 labels the sites of a cubic lattice , and @xmath2 for @xmath3 denotes the unit lattice vector in the respective direction .",

    "how the distinctive features of polaron formation found for zero phonon frequency persist at small @xmath31 is manifest in a comparison of the 1d ( @xmath9 ) and 3d ( @xmath10 ) curves for @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , given as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the steep decrease of @xmath34 in the vicinity of @xmath35 for 3d , @xmath36 is a precursor of the self - trapping transition for @xmath28 , which takes place at @xmath37 . in 1d",
    "the polaron radius decreases steadily with @xmath23 , and no crossover region can be identified .",
    "although the latter behaviour is reminiscent of the 1d large - to - small polaron crossover at @xmath28 , we observe that even for small phonon frequency @xmath38 no large polaron is found . in ref .",
    "it was shown that , independent of dimension , for weak coupling the polaron radius approaches @xmath39 ( compare the 1d and 3d curve for @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the polaron radius is bounded by that limiting value , e.g. , for @xmath41 , at most @xmath42 . to obtain a large polaron of radius greater than 5 or 10",
    ", @xmath43 must be less than 0.01 to 0.04 for weak coupling @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore the polaron shrinks rapidly with increasing coupling . even for @xmath28 a coupling of , say",
    ", @xmath45 leads to a polaron radius of only @xmath46 .",

    "as for the radius the distinctive differences of polaron formation in 1d and 3d are manifest in a comparison of the corresponding curves for @xmath40 . while in 1d the polaron mass increases steadily with @xmath23 , a steep increase of @xmath62 occurs in the vicinity of @xmath63 for 3d .",
    "one can therefore locate , for small phonon frequency @xmath64 in 3d , the crossover from a light particle to a heavy polaron in the region @xmath65 , while in 1d no crossover region can be identified .",
    "the differences between 1d and 3d vanish for larger phonon frequencies @xmath66 ( not shown here ) , where the mass indicates the continuous evolution from a light to a heavy polaron with increasing @xmath23 . in the anti - adiabatic regime @xmath67 , the relation @xmath68 with @xmath69 holds independent of dimension .",
    "the behaviour of the 1d polaron mass for small phonon frequency is reminiscent of the large - to - small polaron crossover in the @xmath28-limit .",
    "however , for @xmath28 the mass of the 1d polaron is strictly infinite for any coupling strength in 1d .",
    "the @xmath28-result therefore does not provide a quantitative prediction for the polaron mass at any finite phonon frequency .",
    "owing to that restriction , it is also not sufficient to establish the existence of large polarons with substantial mass renormalization even for the adiabatic case @xmath70 .",
    "instead we see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , that even for a small phonon frequency @xmath38 the mass of the 1d polaron is still close to unity for those coupling strengths @xmath71 , for which a large polaron is found for sufficiently small @xmath31 .",
    "to obtain polarons with large mass and large radius therefore requires small coupling strengths @xmath72 ( to allow for a large radius ) and even smaller phonon frequencies @xmath73 ( to allow for a large mass ) .",
    "consequently , such heavy adiabatic large polarons may exist only at extremely small phonon frequencies @xmath74 .",
    "we note that ( i ) in general no large - to - small polaron crossover occurs even at small phonon frequencies in 1d , ( ii ) the adiabatic regime of large ( heavy ) polarons occupies only the very narrow parameter region of tiny phonon frequencies , thus ( iii ) the destabilization of large quasi-1d polarons at small @xmath8 emin obtained for @xmath28 can be expected to be relevant only in that narrow region .",
    "qualitatively , we expect strong deviations from the findings for @xmath28 even for small - to - intermediate phonon frequencies beyond the extreme adiabatic regime .     of polaron radii as a function of anisotropy @xmath8 , for @xmath31 and @xmath75 as indicated .",
    "here the dotted curve gives the weak - coupling result @xmath76 . ]",
    "let us now begin with the quantitative discussion of the anisotropic case .",
    "since in the extreme adiabatic regime of large ( heavy ) polarons the question of polaron properties in anisotropic materials was already settled by emin  @xcite we exclude this narrow region from our further consideration .",
    "instead we concentrate on the broader regime of small - to - intermediate phonon frequencies .",
    "obviously , the polaron radius does not indicate per se to which degree the polaron ceases to be a true 1d particle for small @xmath8 .",
    "we may instead use the ratio @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , which we interpret as a measure of the `` one - dimensionality '' of the polaron : for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , the polaron is a fully 1d ( isotropic 3d ) object .",
    "we see that already for small @xmath8 the ratio @xmath80 deviates significantly from zero , but @xmath81 is a continuous function of @xmath8 in contrast to the behaviour in the @xmath28-limit . for weak coupling ,",
    "we recover @xmath82 , as can be derived by perturbation theory  @xcite . for strong coupling ,",
    "the asymptotic behaviour @xmath83 is approached . for intermediate coupling ( @xmath84 in the figure )",
    "we observe how the curve interpolates between the strong - coupling straight line at smaller @xmath8 and the weak - coupling square root at larger @xmath8 . to understand this observation",
    ", we shall now use the polaron mass to further clarify how the polaron properties change with @xmath8 .",
    "for different anisotropy @xmath8 , and phonon frequencies @xmath4 as indicated . in each panel , eleven curves for @xmath85 in steps of @xmath86 are shown .",
    "note that for fixed @xmath87 the coupling @xmath5 depends on @xmath88 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the polaron mass @xmath62 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath87 , for different @xmath4 and anisotropy @xmath8 .",
    "we see that the curves for intermediate values of @xmath8 smoothly interpolate between the 1d and 3d case .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath28-limit a sudden transition from 1d to 3d behaviour at small @xmath8 is missing . nevertheless , for @xmath40 and @xmath89 , the mass @xmath62 increases by a huge factor if @xmath8 grows from zero to one .",
    "note that this scenario is opposite to polaron destabilization in the @xmath28-limit , where a large polaron evolves into a free electron at weaker coupling @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "@xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show @xmath62 as a function of @xmath8 for fixed @xmath5 .",
    "generally , the polaron mass @xmath62 decreases with increasing @xmath88 . for larger phonon frequencies ,",
    "@xmath62 depends only weakly on @xmath8 , in agreement with our considerations above . for small phonon frequency ( @xmath40 ) , we see how a heavy 1d polaron with @xmath92 evolves into a light 3d particle with @xmath93 as @xmath8 grows from zero to one .",
    "this behaviour occurs if the coupling is sufficiently large to create a heavy polaron in 1d ( i.e. @xmath94 ) but below the heavy polaron crossover region @xmath65 in 3d seen in the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( i.e. @xmath95 ) .",
    "exactly then the ratio @xmath81 interpolates between the strong- and weak - coupling curve ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . based on this condition a rough estimate for the @xmath8 value when the particle finally becomes light ( i.e. @xmath93 )",
    "is provided by the comparison of coupling energy to kinetic energy , yielding @xmath96 or @xmath97 , e.g. @xmath98 for @xmath84 .",
    "this estimate does essentially not depend on phonon frequency .",
    "especially , our findings persist also for @xmath99 .     as a function of anisotropy @xmath8 , for @xmath31 and @xmath75 as indicated.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the observed evolution from a heavy to a light particle at small - to - intermediate phonon frequency is the equivalent of polaron destabilization in the @xmath28-limit .",
    "we however note significant differences to the @xmath28 scenario .",
    "first , it requires coupling strengths for which the 1d polaron is not large .",
    "if the coupling is weak enough to allow for a large 1d polaron , no significant change of the polaron mass can occur on increasing @xmath8 since the 1d mass is already of the order @xmath100 . recall that we exclude the extreme adiabatic regime , where this statement may be violated for extremely small phonon frequencies , from our considerations .",
    "second , in contrast to the behaviour at zero phonon frequency , the change in @xmath62 takes place in a large range of @xmath8 , and does not occur as a rapid crossover in the vicinity of a small @xmath8-value .",
    "these differences clearly show that the concept of polaron destabilization in quasi-1d systems is only of restricted relevance at finite phonon frequencies .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the arguments for @xmath28 rely on the existence of large polarons . as discussed before ,",
    "those fail to exist even at small phonon frequencies @xmath101 .",
    "a repeated question raised for quasi-1d systems is whether a local or isotropic electron - phonon interaction can enhance the anisotropy in the electronic transfer integrals , leading to @xmath102 .",
    "large anisotropies in polaron mobility that exceed the estimates from , e.g. , band structure calculations by several orders of magnitude can be explained if acoustic phonons are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "it is common belief that a similar mechanism is absent in the holstein model due to the purely local interaction with isotropic optical phonons .    as a measure for the anisotropy of mass renormalization",
    ", we define @xmath103 or equivalently @xmath104 . in the anti - adiabatic strong - coupling limit , with @xmath105 ,",
    "the mass renormalization is isotropic ( @xmath106 ) , but for smaller phonon frequency @xmath107 is possible .",
    "an enhancement of anisotropy corresponds to @xmath108 .    , @xmath109 and mass renormalization anisotropy @xmath110 as a function of @xmath8 , for @xmath111 .",
    "left panel : for @xmath112 , the renormalization @xmath113 is given by the inverse quasiparticle weight @xmath114 ( dotted line ) .",
    "right panel : in addition , @xmath110 is shown for a 2d system . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show @xmath62 , @xmath109 and the ratio @xmath110 for three choices of parameters .",
    "we see that generally @xmath115 , and @xmath110 is maximal for @xmath25 , while of course @xmath106 for @xmath10 . evidently , @xmath110 is largest for small phonon frequency and large coupling , when deviations from the anti - adiabatic limit with @xmath106 are most significant .    from first order perturbation theory in @xmath88",
    "we conclude that @xmath116 for @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the fractional difference between the quasiparticle weight @xmath119 at momentum @xmath120 ( @xmath121 denotes the @xmath120 groundstate ) and the inverse mass renormalization @xmath122 at @xmath25 .",
    "this relation holds independent of dimension . as a consequence of the momentum dependence of the polaron self - energy",
    ", @xmath123 is possible  @xcite . that @xmath124 , and thus @xmath108 , results from effective long - range hopping processes induced by electron - phonon - coupling , which reduce @xmath122 compared to @xmath114 . in a certain sense , @xmath125 measures the deviation from the anti - adiabatic strong - coupling result @xmath126 , when @xmath127 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show @xmath125 for fixed @xmath128 as a function of @xmath4 . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath125 is close to zero as the anti - adiabatic limit is approached . for @xmath130 and fixed @xmath128 , the ratio @xmath125 converges to zero since the weak coupling regime is reached .",
    "decreasing @xmath4 or increasing @xmath5 , the ratio @xmath125 , and thus @xmath110 , can be made very large .",
    "for the parameters plotted , @xmath110 can attain values as large as @xmath131 .",
    "note that @xmath110 is already large for small coupling @xmath132 provided @xmath31 is small ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , which implies that the mechanism described here is relevant for realistic materials .     between @xmath133 and @xmath134 as a function of @xmath31 , in 1d with @xmath25 , for fixed @xmath69 , or fixed @xmath75 in the inset .",
    "to sum up , the exact results provided in this work help to clarify the issue of polaron formation in anisotropic 3d materials , including the 1d and isotropic 3d case . in the extreme adiabatic regime , where large heavy 1d polarons exist for tiny phonon frequencies @xmath135 , the scenario of polaron destabilization given by emin  @xcite applies .",
    "we present complementary results for the broader regime of small - to - intermediate phonon frequency and small - to - strong coupling strength . in combination with emin s work at least the most fundamental answers to the holstein polaron anisotropy problem",
    "are thereby given .",
    "the regime of very strong coupling or large phonon frequency , where a polaron is always small or its properties do not depend on dimension , deserves no further exploration in that context .",
    "our findings have two major implications .",
    "first , polaron destabilization occurs only in the extreme adiabatic regime , but the concept does not carry over to finite phonon frequencies without significant modifications .",
    "although it is possible to drive a heavy 1d polaron into a light 3d particle by increasing the perpendicular electronic transfer integral , a smooth crossover takes place instead of an instability . in any case , polarons in quasi-1d materials can be described by the 1d holstein model for small perpendicular transfer integrals .",
    "the second implication is that even a local holstein interaction enhances the anisotropy in electron motion . for small phonon frequencies",
    "this enhancement is of significant size already at weak - to - moderate coupling . as a question for future research we mention that the anisotropy enhancement becomes even more important for longer - ranged electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we stress that the frequent assumption that the holstein interaction leads only to isotropic changes of material properties is not true .",
    "experimentally observed anisotropic behaviour provides no indication against a dominating short - range holstein - like coupling .",
