    "the first asteroid satellite was discovered during the galileo spacecraft encounter with the asteroid 243 ida in 1993 @xcite .",
    "the following years have revealed discoveries of binary systems among the near - earth objects , main - belt asteroids , mars - crossers , trojans and trans - neptunian objects . @xcite and @xcite introduced a simple division of multiple asteroid systems into : 1 ) _ large asteroids with small satellites _ ;",
    "2 ) _ similar size and synchronous double asteroids _ ; 3 ) _ small asynchronous systems _ ; 4 ) _ contact - binary asteroids _ ; and 5 ) _ small wide binaries_.    the asteroid 90 antiope was the first doubly synchronous system discovered with ground - based observations , using direct imaging obtained in august 2000 with the keck adaptive optics ( ao ) system @xcite .",
    "this disk - resolved images showed a binary system with similar - sized components of 85 km diameter , separated by 170 km .",
    "the orbital period of the components was found to be 16.5 h. the mass of these two components was also determined leading to a bulk density of @xmath11 g @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite reported an extensively campaign of ao observations of antiope carried out on 26 nights in 2003 - 2005 ( mainly february  march 2004 ) using the systems at yepun - vlt ( eso , chile ) and keck telescope at mauna kea ( hawaii , usa ) .",
    "with all available lightcurve data and ao observations they determined the physical and orbital model of the antiope binary system using roche ellipsoids as shape solutions .",
    "the lengths of semimajor axes of the components were determined to be @xmath12 km and @xmath13 km .",
    "the calculated orbital separation of these two components of @xmath14 km and the orbital period of @xmath15 h were obtained .",
    "the ecliptic coordinates of the pole of the system were determined as @xmath16 = @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a total mass of ( @xmath19)@xmath8 kg and a bulk density of @xmath20 g @xmath10 were determined , leading to a macro - porosity of 30 per cent .",
    "the rotational lightcurves of this asteroid showed some asymmetries that could not be explained using ellipsoidal shape models . to account for",
    "that @xcite introduced a large - scale depression located on one of the components .",
    "this giant crater of about 68 km in diameter had its center located at @xmath21 in longitude and @xmath22 in latitude on the trailing side of the component .",
    "this modification could better explain the observed light variations and lead to a slight modification of the bulk density to @xmath23 g @xmath10 .",
    "the authors claimed that the crater could be a result of a collision between a 100 km sized proto - antiope with another body beloging to the themis family .",
    "the impactor body should have a diameter greather than 17 km and an impact velocity in the range of 1 - 4 km s@xmath24 .",
    "such event had a 50 per cent probability to have occurred over the age of the themis family .",
    "in february 2009 @xcite obtained spectra of both components of antiope from 1.1 to 2.4 @xmath25 m .",
    "they turned out to be very similar , their slopes being in agreement with c - type asteroids .",
    "this indicated that both bodies were formed at the same time and from the same material .",
    "this confirmed that the system could be the result of the breakup of a proto - antiope rubble - pile as suggested by @xcite .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "on 19 july 2011 , the double asteroid 90 antiope occulted the 6.7 mag lq aqr star .",
    "the path of this event was predicted to be visible mostly in the northern california .",
    "the stellar occultation was positively recorded by 43 stations @xcite and a large scale topographical irregularity was reconstructed from the occultation timings on the southern component of the system .",
    "its position was calculated at longitude 315@xmath26 and latitude -40@xmath26 .",
    "so far , the _ in situ _ observations obtained with space missions ( such as the 253 mathilde and 433 eros imaging collected with the near shoemaker spacecraft ) revealed asteroids with concavities and topographical depressions which diverge from a convex shape representation .",
    "for this reason it is necessary to investigate methods capable of deriving non - convex models which shall provide a closer view on the real asteroids shapes .",
    "we present a new version of the sage ( shaping asteroids with genetic evolution ) method for determining a non - convex shape model of 90 antiope .",
    "the derived model is compared with the previous results presented in @xcite .",
    "we have scaled the model projecting its shape to the star occultation silhouettes obtained in july 2011 @xcite .",
    "the model permitted a refined calculation of the components volumes leading to a higher density estimation .",
    "the method starts with defining two independent components , each described by 62 vectors uniformly distributed in space and with a common origin ( geometric center of the body ) .",
    "these vectors define a mesh of 62 vertices called a generator shape .",
    "the directions of the vectors are fixed , while their lengths evolve during the minimisation process .",
    "once the generator shape is generated , the catmull - clark subdivision method is applied @xcite , resulting in a smoother shape representation of the two components , described by a higher resolution mesh .",
    "the center of mass is then calculated for each object , considering the components to be homogeneous with uniform density @xmath27 and total mass @xmath28 .",
    "the rotational inertia of each component is characterized by its inertia tensor @xmath29 , so the inertia tensor relative to the center of mass is used in order to find the bodies principal moments and axes .",
    "finally , the main reference axes are redirected so the z - axis coincides with the principal axis of rotation of each component .",
    "we will henceforth call this system the body frame and its axes are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "an example of the described process can be seen for two different asteroid shapes in fig .",
    "[ pierwszy ] and fig .",
    "[ drugie ] .",
    "we define a cartesian coordinate system of axes , with the x - axis passing through the center of mass of the two objects and coincident with the body frame @xmath30 axis of each component .",
    "we can then place one object on the positive part of the x - axis and the other on the negative , where the origin of the system is the position of the center of mass of the whole system ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "moreover , we define the distance between the center of mass of each asteroid ( @xmath34 ) along the x - axis as @xmath35 . for each component",
    "we also define @xmath36 and @xmath37 as the norms of the vectors from the center of mass of the body to the circumscribed circle over the projected shape of the body , and @xmath38 describes the size ratio between the two components .",
    "a schema of the defined binary system can be seen in fig .",
    "[ uklad ] .     and",
    "@xmath38 are the parameters used to relate the two bodies during the minimization process , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the positions of the body centers of mass with respect to the system s center of mass.,width=321 ]    these last values , @xmath35 and @xmath38 , are used to define the relation between the two components and will be used as parameters during the minimisation procedure , together with the 62 vertices of each body and the pole orientation of the system .",
    "an eccentrict orbit would produce a shift in the minima position between observations obtained during different apparitions .",
    "as we have not observed such phenomena , the system s orbit is considered to be circular .",
    "therefore , the parameters to describe the system include :    * 62 vertex distances from the center of the first body ( generator shape 1 ) * 62 vertex distances from the center of the second body ( generator shape 2 ) * distance between the center of masses ( @xmath35 ) * size ratio between the two components ( @xmath38 ) * pole solution ( @xmath41 )    two additional parameters ( rotational period @xmath42 and the rotation angle of the body at zero phase @xmath43 ) are calculated by finding the best period solution scanning along a given interval .      in order to calculate the moments of inertia",
    ", we use the formulae described by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the components are homogeneous , with uniform density @xmath44 and total mass @xmath45 .",
    "then each simplex is also homogeneous , with mass @xmath46 . to find the center of mass @xmath47 of each component ,",
    "recall that its moment of mass @xmath48 is just the sum of the mass moments @xmath49 @xmath50 of all the simplices .",
    "therefore , the centre of mass location is given by the vector @xmath47 @xmath51 and the origin of the system of axes can be translated to obtain @xmath52 .",
    "the rotational inertia of a rigid body may be characterized by its inertia tensor @xmath53 and in the given situation , @xmath29 is relative to the center of mass .    the attitude matrix is usually expressed in terms of the 3 - 1 - 3 set of the euler angles : rotation angle @xmath54 , nutation angle @xmath55 , and precession angle @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "although the euler angles are quite useful in describing rotation , they also posses serious drawbacks : they become undetermined for @xmath57 or @xmath58 , and the elements of the attitude matrix depend on trigonometric functions of the angles .",
    "the latter property implies that their use in numerical integration is rather costly . in these circumstances , we prefer to use the euler parameters @xcite . although the vector of the euler parameters @xmath59 consists of four elements ( one more variable , compared to the euler angles ) , the elements @xmath60 of the attitude matrix are easily expressible in terms of @xmath61 @xmath62 involving only products or squares .",
    "the relation between the euler angles and @xmath61 , often required in order to input the initial conditions , is @xmath63    when the system rotates , the euler parameters change according to the differential equations @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the angular rate vector in the body frame . in the case of a principal axis rotation , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . except for the components of @xmath61 , subscripts @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 refer to the axes @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 respectively .      ,",
    "@xmath55,@xmath56 ) , relating the fixed frame ( f ) to the body frame ( b).,width=226 ]    in order to generate a synthetic picture of the components as seen on a hypothetical ccd image , we introduce a new cartesian coordinate system of axes ( @xmath72,@xmath73,@xmath74 ) that we call the fixed frame .",
    "this system of axes is related to the body frame using the attitude matrix ( an illustration can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : euler ] ) .",
    "the fixed frame is a heliocentric system , where we can define @xmath75 and @xmath76 as the vectors in a given moment of time towards the asteroid and the earth respectively .",
    "those vectors can be either calculated using keplerian orbits and the analytical expressions described in @xcite or can be obtained by an ephemeris computation service such as horizons .",
    "additionally , we describe the spin axis using the angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while we use @xmath56 to characterize the system rotation .",
    "we also define the vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 as the vectors towards the earth and the sun from the system frame ( i.e. the earth and sun asterocentric positions ) , and its transformation to the fixed frame became straighforward using the @xmath60 attitude matrix : @xmath79 as a mean to calculate the illumination of the components , we define a square virtual ccd frame . if @xmath80 is the vector from the system s center of mass @xmath33 , to the circumscribed circle over the projected shape of the two components , then the minimum dimension of a virtual ccd frame which can contain the whole system is @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 is the norm of the vector @xmath80 ) .",
    "each frame is divided into @xmath83 pixels and its plane is perpendicular to the direction of @xmath78 and placed in an infinite distance behind the system .",
    "then we can make use of a z - buffer standard graphic method described by @xcite , projecting the components triangular mesh onto the virtual frame .",
    "for each pixel in the frame we allocate a buffer with an initial value defined at an infinite distance . before storing the number of a projected triangle of the components mesh , the program checks the distance to the virtual frame .",
    "if the distance is smaller than the stored value , the new value is written .",
    "once all the triangles are projected , we are able to determine which ones ( and to what extent ) are hidden by other triangles , or which are not illuminated .",
    "finally , to calculate the brightness as seen from the observer point of view , we make the plane perpendicular to @xmath77 ( earth - pointing vector ) .",
    "the above described z - buffer procedure is repeated , with the brightness being now stored in the virtual frame . when computing the brightness , we take into account the projective shadowing and we use a linear combination of two different scattering laws , with 0.1 for the lambert law and 0.9 for the lommel - seeliger law following @xcite .",
    "when the procedure is done , we can compute the brightness by taking the sum of all stored values .",
    "the minimization procedure compares at each step the simulated brightness with the photometric observations using a @xmath84 test . for each single lightcurve",
    "we compute the standard deviation , which allows to obtain a normalized @xmath84 that takes into account the quality of the given observation .",
    "the method has one main drawback : it is high cpu demanding .",
    "for this reason it is essential to make use of a cpu cluster if we want to obtain a result in a reasonable period of time .",
    "therefore , we used the pozna s observatory cluster , that consist of 27 workstations equipped with a 6 core amd processor ( 3 ghz ) .",
    "the minimising procedure consists of two modules summarized in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the initial seed of the loop will be the sphere - like shapes of the two asteroids and a random orientation of the system .",
    "the first module randomly mutates the model parameters ( the mesh of vertices , the spin parameters and the system parameters ) .",
    "the best trial solution found becomes the seed for the consecutive random evolution and the process is cyclically repeated .",
    "the second module ( active balance ) allocates different weights to the observations , calculating @xmath84 for each lightcurve , and giving greater weight to the observation with the worst fit .",
    "this procedure allows the method to bypass local minima .",
    "obviously any erroneous observations ( bad reduction , wrong time recorded , etc ... ) must be removed previously in order not to interfere the process .",
    "therefore , the method tries to find the solution that best fits all the observations , and the results of the modeling are the parameters of the smallest @xmath84 found .",
    "the evolution of the model parameters is controlled by the genetic algorithm routines . in order to be sure that the evolution is not trapped in a local minimum",
    ", we repeat the fitting process several times , starting from the same initial spherical shapes .",
    "this generates a family of solutions , similar in global terms",
    ". the formal solution will be the family member that stabilizes in a lowest @xmath84 .",
    "if the family members are not converging to a similar solution , it would be a clear signal that there are not enough constraints to derive the model e.g. the given asteroid should be observed in the future apparitions with different observational geometries .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     knowing the distance between the two centers of mass and the orbital period , we calculated the total mass of the system , resulting in @xmath85 kg .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the one reported by descamps et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "however , the equivalent radii ( and volumes ) are smaller than the ones obtained in previous studies , thus the inferred bulk density of 90 antiope resulted to be 30 per cent larger ( see table  [ modelresults ] ) .",
    "we derived a non - convex model of 90 antiope which reproduces its photometric observations and fits the chords obtained during the 2011 stellar occultation @xcite .",
    "the latter observations enabled us to scale the model and derive its fundamental physical properties .",
    "we have found a density 30 per cent higher than the one calculated in previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the components separation resulting from our calculations ( @xmath6 km ) is larger than the values presented in studies based on disk resolved imaging ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but smaller compared to the value obtained with a roche ellipsoid model @xcite .",
    "the intermidate - scale features revealed by the shape solution supports the giant crater hypothesis presented by @xcite and confirms that large - scale depressions are present on the trailing side of the southern component .",
    "this work was partially supported by grant n n203 404139 from the polish ministry of science and higher education .",
    "the work of tsr was carried out through the gaia research for european astronomy training ( great - itn ) network .",
