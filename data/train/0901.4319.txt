    "lessons and homework problems involving a pendulum are often a big part of introductory physics classes and laboratory courses .",
    "@xcite typically experiments are limited to using photogates to measure the period of the pendulum .",
    "commercial rotary motion sensors that allow students to collect real - time motion data for a pendulum exist , but often the cost is too great to provide each student in the class with such a sensor , especially in developing countries .",
    "in contrast , a new two - button button ball - type mouse can be purchased for under @xmath0 us dollars and surplus used units are often available at little to no cost",
    ". therefore we present a low - cost , easy - to - build rotary sensor pendulum using the existing hardware in a computer mouse .",
    "there have been other attempts to use common computer peripherals as data acquisition interfaces .",
    "t. j. bensky in 2001 described the use of a computer joystick to track the motion of a pendulum .",
    "@xcite we considered using his design when building a data - logging pendulum , but computer joysticks have changed considerably in the past @xmath1 years .",
    "few , if any , models are sold that do not self - center ; this is a crucial feature to bensky s original design .",
    "three papers by handler , ochoa , and kolp feature the use of a computer mouse in tracking motion in a lenz s law experiment and in harmonic motion experiments using springs .",
    "@xcite in each case a string was wrapped around the roller in the mouse so that a linear displacement could be measured .    in the last @xmath2",
    "years since these experiments , significant changes in mouse hardware years have made it easier than ever to use a computer mouse to measure angular displacement as well . at the time that these papers were written ,",
    "the rollers in the mouse featured a series of electrical contacts that would produce a signal by brushing against a wire as the mouse was moved .",
    "this has since been nearly universally replaced by an opto - mechanical mechanism that is much lower in friction .",
    "the rollers now have slotted disks , and photogates sense the motion of the disk without any physical contact required .",
    "this improved hardware is ideal for tracking the motion of a pendulum because measurement friction is low and because modern ball - type mice feature opto - mechanical mechanisms which directly measure angular displacement .",
    "there exist computer mice that use a purely optical mechanism to detect translation , namely , a low resolution camera on the underside of the mouse .",
    "the camera repeatedly takes pictures of the surface under the mouse and interprets differences between successive frames as motion .",
    "while these mice work the same way to the user , this type of mouse has no mechanical components and is not well suited for this application . it may be possible to adapt an optical mouse for other mechanical experiments , but in this work we specifically take advantage of the hardware present in ball - type mice",
    "the following parts and tools are needed : a ball - type computer mouse , a wooden or plastic dowel , a small screwdriver ( used to open the mouse casing ) , a pair of small clippers ( used to cut back the mouse casing ) , and a small drill bit ( approximately the diameter of the dowel ) .",
    "we remove the cover of the mouse and locate the best digital angular encoder ( with roller ) to use for a pendulum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mouse ] ) .",
    "we cut away enough of the cover to allow access to the encoder , then replace the cover to provide support to the assembly . in this case",
    "we allow for moderate amplitude ( @xmath3 ) motion of the pendulum by cutting back the plastic near the roller . with additional hardware it is possible to mount the brackets of the roller from either side to allow for full @xmath4 motion of the pendulum .",
    "if the pendulum is not mounted directly to the roller but the pendulum is suspended independently and the roller is connected directly to it , measurement friction can be eliminated .",
    "a small drill bit turned by hand will make a hole in the roller .",
    "a rod with the same diameter as the drill bit will fit into this hole and will function as the pendulum .",
    "we used a thin wooden dowel , cm , a diameter of @xmath5 mm and a mass of @xmath6 g . ] but a small plastic rod would work equally well .",
    "since no glue is used , rods of varying lengths can be easily substituted during experiments .",
    "[ fig : pend ] shows the completed experimental apparatus .",
    "we plug the mouse into the universal serial bus ( usb ) port of a computer .",
    "the resolution of the apparatus is limited by the number and spacing of the slots in the disk of the angular encoder .",
    "therefore , it is possible to calibrate the motion of the cursor to angular displacement units .",
    "one calibration method is to determine the motion in pixels of one or more full turns of the roller . for the apparatus we built ,",
    "a rotation of @xmath7 degrees gave a change in the position of the cursor of @xmath8 pixels .",
    "this results in a conversion factor of @xmath9 radians per pixel .",
    "a custom computer program is used to the motion of the cursor in pixels . for a link to the source code of the computer program used to track the cursor . ]",
    "we find that the apparatus has a resolution of @xmath9 radians , which corresponds to a fractional uncertainty of @xmath10 out of a full turn .",
    "the standard equation of motion of a pendulum with damping is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the moment of inertia . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the mass and length of the rod , respectively , while @xmath15 is acceleration due to gravity and @xmath16 controls the strength of the damping term . also , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the angle measured down from the vertical , the angular velocity , and the angular acceleration , respectively . in the small angle approximation ,",
    "the equation of motion reduces to @xmath20 we can write the solution as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the decay constant and @xmath23 is the frequency of free oscillations .",
    "@xcite    @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined using the initial conditions .",
    "[ fig : data ] shows a plot of position versus time data for the pendulum when released from rest ) .",
    "the dashed line shows a fit of the turning points to an exponential decay envelope . for the pendulum ,",
    "we obtain @xmath26 with @xmath27 for the fit .",
    "this simple investigation is quite easy to do using the data from this apparatus , but next to impossible using only photogates .",
    "this is a simple example of a high school or undergraduate level laboratory experiment that uses the apparatus but it is well suited to more advanced teaching applications such as exploring the driven physical pendulum or coupling between pendula .",
    "the mouse - pendulum is a low cost solution to the need for an experimental pendulum that provides real - time angular displacement data .",
    "the small - amplitude period of the pendulum ( approximately @xmath28s for the apparatus we built ) depends only on the length of the rod and can be easily adjusted for various experiments .",
    "this apparatus is ideal for undergraduate and even high school lab classes .",
    "furthermore , the low cost makes it possible for teachers with very limited budgets and those in developing countries to provide each student in the class with a useful piece of lab equipment .",
    "the ease of construction allows building the pendulum to be a good classroom exercise , during which practical experimental considerations ( such as how to minimize friction ) may be discussed .",
    "this design is robust for serious experimental work as well .",
    "source code to free data logging software to record the motion of the pendulum can be obtained online .",
