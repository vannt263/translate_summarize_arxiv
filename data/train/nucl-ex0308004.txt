    "brahms is the only rhic experiment that is able to study fully identified particle production and energy flow over a wide range of rapidity ( from y=0 to y=4 for pions ) .",
    "this coverage , which almost reaches the fragmentation regions , is ideal for studies of the bulk properties of the system formed in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies . this work reports recent results obtained from the analysis of data collected with the brahms spectrometers in au - au collisions at @xmath2 gev .",
    "a detailed description of the brahms experimental setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "all results shown here are preliminary and were obtained from a sample of the @xmath1 most central events .",
    "momentum distributions of fully identified charged particles were obtained with conventional magnetic spectrometers instrumented with state - of - the - art time - of - flight and ring imaging and threshold erenkov detectors . for each particle type",
    ", the density in rapidity space is obtained by integration over the @xmath3 dependence of these distributions . with the distributions dropping rapidly",
    "as @xmath3 increases , a good fraction of the integral comes from unmeasured yields at low @xmath3 .",
    "an extrapolation is thus necessary to cover the unmeasured regions .",
    "empirically the pion yields were found to be best fitted by a power law , the kaon distributions by a single exponential in @xmath4 , and the proton distributions with a single exponential in @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting rapidity density distributions are shown in panels a and b of figure 1 .",
    "panel a shows the densities for all charged particles .",
    "because pions dominate this figure , panel b expands the view for the kaon , proton and antiproton distributions .",
    "a remarkable feature of these distributions is their common bell shape character .",
    "( pions , kaons and anti - proton distributions are fitted well with double gaussians ) .",
    "this observation has a possible explanation based on the postulate that particle production in the momentum range measured in the present experiment is driven primarily by the distribution of partons in the colliding ions . as the energy of the collisions increases , the parton distributions can be resolved to smaller values of x ( fraction of the total momentum of the hadron ) .",
    "the convolution of the left and right moving parton distributions leads to an initial bell - shaped dn / dy distribution for produced particles in symmetric system centered around y=0 .",
    "this distribution may evolve in later stages through secondary interactions , but it retains its bell shape . in this picture",
    "there is neither a wide plateau connecting the two fragmentation regions , as feynman s intuition had it @xcite , nor an extended boost invariant longitudinal expansion , as proposed by bjorken @xcite .",
    "a good summary of all the @xmath4 distributions extracted in this analysis is shown in panel c of figure 1 ; the average transverse momentum with which the detected particles are produced at different rapidities .",
    "worth noting in this result is the small change of the pion and kaon average @xmath6 as function of y. for comparison , a calculated average @xmath4 for pions is also drawn in panel c. the curve was obtained with a single thermal source described by a boltzmann distribution with a temperature of 200 mev .",
    "an inspection of the transverse momentum distributions shows that for the more massive particles there is a very clear curvature in the spectra as the value of @xmath3 approaches zero ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this observation , together with the almost exponential shape of the distributions at higher @xmath3 and for lower mass particles , is well reproduced by a functional form based on a thermalized system expanding radially @xcite .",
    "after integration over y and azimuthal angle and assuming that a boltzmann distribution describes the system , the following functional form is obtained , and is used to fit the spectra :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the transverse velocity of the flow in units of c , and t is the decoupling temperature .",
    "several functions that describe the radial dependence of the flow velocity have been proposed . here",
    "the simplest assumption of a transverse flow velocity that is constant at all radii is assumed .",
    "this choice may not be fully adequate , but does serve to highlight the rapidity dependence of the flow velocity .",
    "the table 1 summarizes the results .",
    ".results of blast wave fits [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]     the shapes of the distributions are well reproduced by the fits , with a 30 % reduction in transverse velocity found going from y-0 to y=3 .",
    "this reduction is also suggested by the different shape of the mid - rapidity proton distributions as compared to that at the most forward rapidity , as shown in fig .",
    "2b where the y=0 points have been shifted down to facilitate the comparison .",
    "the measured net proton at mid - rapidity @xcite,@xcite was an early subject of much discussion in the community because it went against an expected baryon free region around @xmath9 ; the energy of the colliding beams was so high that the initial baryon number should end up in the fragmentation regions if tied to the valence quarks .",
    "but the first results extracted at y=0 indicated otherwise , the net - proton number was not equal to zero .",
    "some mechanism was transporting baryon number to mid - rapidity .",
    "d. kharzeev @xcite had predicted that the x distributions of gluons of the initial baryon extend to very small values of x. at the time of the collision these distributions would overlap and after `` dressing '' with quarks from the sea the low - x gluons of the initial baryons bring in effect net baryon number to mid - rapidity .",
    "this effect would have a rapidity dependence as @xmath10 where z is the charge of the ions , and b is related to nature of the system that brings baryon number to mid - rapidity and predicted to be close to 1/2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is set to be equal to 4.5 .",
    "figure 3 shows the net charge measured up to rapidity 3 and a fit to the function mentioned above , the fit parameters are @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "analysis of the most central data sample collected during rhic run-2 ( au - au at @xmath2 gev ) is consistent with a thermalized system with a decoupling temperature around 120 mev , and a strong radial flow @xmath14 that diminishes by as much as 30% at the most forward rapidity measured .",
