    "anomalous transverse momentum and net charge event - by - event fluctuations have been proposed as indicators of the formation of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the midst of high - energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "a number of authors @xcite have argued that entropy conserving hadronization of a plasma of quarks and gluons should produce a final state characterized by a dramatic reduction of the net charge fluctuations relative to that of a hadron gas .",
    "simply put , their prediction relies on the notion that quark - quark correlations can be neglected , and hadronization of gluons produces pairs of positive and negative particles not contributing to the net charge fluctuations .",
    "accounting for the fractional charge of the quarks , they find that , for a qgp , the variance of the ratio of positive and negative particles scaled by the total charged particle multiplicity , a quantity they call @xmath8 , should be approximately four times smaller than for a gas of hadron .",
    "quark - quark correlation may however not be negligible ; koch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended their original estimates to include susceptibilities calculated on the lattice .",
    "they find the quantity @xmath9 ( where , @xmath10 is the variance of the net charge , q = @xmath11 - @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the total number of charged particles observed in a particular momentum space window under consideration ) is quantitatively different from their first basic estimate but nonetheless still dramatically smaller than values expected for a hadron gas .",
    "it is clear however that hadron collisions , and in particular heavy ion collisions , produce substantial number of many high mass particles , and specifically short lived ( neutral ) particles or resonances which decay into pairs of positive and negative particles .",
    "such decays increase the multiplicity of charged particles in the final state while producing negligible impact on the net charge variance .",
    "jeon and koch have in fact argued that one can use the magnitude of net charge fluctuations to estimate the relative production of @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons @xcite .",
    "calculations based on a thermal model lead to a value @xmath8 of order of 2.8 which although reduced relative to the value expected for a pion gas is nonetheless remarkably larger than that predicted for a qgp @xcite .",
    "note that transport models such as urqmd predict values in qualitative agreement with those of thermal models @xcite .",
    "a measurement of net charge fluctuations therefore appears , on the outset , as an interesting means to identify the formation of quark gluon plasma in high - energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "first measurements of net charge fluctuations were reported by both phenix @xcite and star @xcite collaborations on the basis of @xmath0 data acquired during the first rhic run at @xmath16 130 gev .",
    "measurements were reported by phenix @xcite in terms of a reduced variance , @xmath17 = @xmath18/@xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately , measured values of this quantity depend on the efficiency .",
    "star instead reported results @xcite in terms of dynamical net charge fluctuations measure , @xmath5 , which is found to be a robust observable i.e. , independent of detection efficiency .",
    "@xmath5 is defined by the expression :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are the number of positively and negatively charged particles in the acceptance of interest . note that there exists a simple relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath21 written @xmath22 .",
    "this relationship is however applicable only if @xmath17 is corrected for finite detection effects .",
    "because such corrections are not trivial , we favor the use of @xmath21 .",
    "we note additionally that both @xmath17 ( corrected for efficiency ) and @xmath21 may be expressed ( at least approximately ) in terms of the variable @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) used by koch _",
    "@xcite for their various predictions . their use , for experimental measurements ,",
    "avoid pitfalls associated with measurements of average values of the ratio , @xmath25 , of particle multiplicities @xmath26 where the denominator , @xmath27 may be small or even zero @xcite .",
    "the measurements performed by the star @xcite and phenix @xcite collaborations showed the dynamical net charge fluctuations in @xmath0 at @xmath28 130 gev are finite but small relative to the predictions by koch _",
    "@xcite for a qgp .",
    "the magnitude of the net charge fluctuations was found to be in qualitative agreement with hijing predictions @xcite although the data exhibit centrality dependence not reproduced within the hijing calculations .",
    "measured values also qualitatively agree with predictions by bialas for quark coalescence @xcite and koch _ et al .",
    "_ for a resonance gas @xcite .",
    "the scenario for dramatically reduced fluctuations as an evidence for the formation of qgp is clearly excluded by the data at 130 gev .",
    "however , in light of predictions of a tri - critical point of the equation of state in the range @xmath29 gev @xcite , one might argue the reduction of fluctuation might be larger at lower beam energies .",
    "conversely , one may also argue the volume of qgp formed in @xmath0 collisions might increase at higher beam energies leading to reduced fluctuations at higher beam energy instead .",
    "one is thus led to wonder whether the fluctuations may be found to vary with beam energy thereby indicating the production of qgp above a critical threshold , or with progressively increasing probability at higher energies . in this paper",
    ", we consider this possibility by investigating how the strength of the dynamical net charge fluctuations vary with beam energy and system size in @xmath0 and @xmath2 collisions ranging in center of mass energy from the highest sps energy to the highest rhic energy , and relative to @xmath30 collisions at @xmath31 200 gev .",
    "the analysis presented also provides , independent of existing models , new information that may shed light on the collision dynamics .",
    "various issues however complicate the measurement and interpretation of net charge fluctuations .",
    "first , one must acknowledge that particle final state systems produced in heavy ion collisions although large , are nonetheless finite and therefore subject to charge conservation effects .",
    "produced particles are also measured in a finite detector acceptance .",
    "second , one may question whether the dynamical net charge fluctuations produced within the qgp phase may survive the hadronization process @xcite .",
    "shuryak and stephanov @xcite have argued based on solutions of the diffusion equation within the context of a model involving bjorken boost invariance , that diffusion in rapidity space considerably increases the net charge fluctuations .",
    "they further argued that the reduced fluctuations predicted for a qgp might be observable only if fluctuations are measured over a very large rapidity range ( of order of 4 units of rapidity ) .",
    "unfortunately , charge conservation effects increase with the rapidity range considered and might become dominant for rapidity ranges of four units or more .",
    "@xcite however argued that the classical diffusion equation yields non - physical solutions in the context of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "they proposed a causal diffusion equation as a substitute of the classical diffusion equation for studies of net charge fluctuation dissipation .",
    "they found that causality substantially limits the extent to which diffusion can dissipate these fluctuations .",
    "third , there exists the possibility that the treatment by koch _",
    "@xcite of quark and gluons behaving as independent particles carrying full entropy may be inappropriate .",
    "consider for instance that recent measurements of elliptical anisotropy of particle emission in @xmath0 collisions show that meson and baryon elliptical flow , @xmath32 , scales in proportion to the number of constituent quarks for transverse momenta in the range 1 - 4 gev / c , thereby suggesting that hadrons are produced relatively early in the collisions through `` coalescence '' or recombination of constituent quarks . in a constituent quark scenario , the role of gluons in particle production is reduced .",
    "relatively smaller charged particle multiplicities are therefore expected , and net charge fluctuations are correspondingly larger .",
    "bialas @xcite conducted a simple estimate of such a scenario , and reported net charge fluctuations @xmath8 may be of order 3.3 .",
    "interestingly , this estimate suggests fluctuations might be even larger than that expected for a resonance gas , and as such should also be identifiable experimentally .",
    "theoretical estimates of the effect of hadronization on net charge fluctuation have been for the most part restricted to studies of the role of resonances , diffusion @xcite , and thermalization @xcite . one",
    "must however confront the notion that collective motion of produced particles is clearly demonstrated in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "voloshin pointed out @xcite that induced radial flow of particles produced in parton - parton collisions at finite radii in nucleus - nucleus collisions generate momentum - position correlations not present in elementary proton - proton collisions . specifically , the effect of radial flow is to induce azimuthal correlations and to modify particle correlation strengths in the longitudinal direction .",
    "voloshin showed that two - particle momentum correlations @xmath33 are in fact sensitive to radial velocity profile as well as the average flow velocity . while one may not intuitively expect net charge fluctuations to exhibit a dramatic dependence on radial flow , simulations based on a simple multinomial particle production model including resonances such as the @xmath34",
    "indicate that net charge correlations are in fact also sensitive to radial flow through azimuthal net charge correlations @xcite .",
    "they may as such be used to complement estimates of radial velocity obtained from fits of single particle spectra with blast - wave parameterization or similar phenomenologies .",
    "measurements of charged particle fluctuations have also been proposed as a tool to discriminate between predictions of various microscopic models of nuclear collisions .",
    "et al . _ @xcite find that measurements of dynamical fluctuations should exhibit sensitivity to rescattering effects based on calculations without rescattering with models vnib @xcite and rqmd @xcite .",
    "they also found that models vnib , hijing @xcite , hijing / bb @xcite and rqmd predict qualitatively different dependencies on collision centrality .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained by abdel - aziz @xcite .",
    "bopp and ranft @xcite compared predictions of net charge fluctuations ( at mid rapidities ) by the dual parton model and statistical ( thermal ) models , and found significant differences in the dispersion of the charges predicted by these models .",
    "they hence argued that charged particle fluctuations should provide a clear signal of the dynamics of heavy ion processes , and enable a direct measurement of the degree of thermalization reached in heavy ion collisions .",
    "gavin @xcite similarly argued , based on data by phenix @xcite and star @xcite that measured transverse momentum and net charge fluctuations indeed present evidence for thermalization at rhic .    in this work ,",
    "we present measurements of dynamical net charge fluctuations in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath16 19.6 , 62.4 , 130 , and 200 gev , @xmath2 collisions at @xmath16 62.4 , 200 gev and in @xmath30 collisions at @xmath35 200 gev .",
    "we study the beam energy , system size and collision centrality dependencies quantitatively in order to identify possible signature of the formation of a qgp .",
    "some of the results presented in this work have been reported as preliminary data at various conferences @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized into sections on experimental method , results , systematic error studies , and conclusions .",
    "our study of dynamical net charge fluctuations dependence on the beam energy is based on the observable @xmath5 used in the first star measurement @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath5 , its properties , and relationships to other measures of event - by - event net charge fluctuations were motivated and presented in detail in refs . @xcite .",
    "the robustness of @xmath5 as an experimental observable was also discussed on the basis of monte carlo toy models by nystrand _",
    "_ @xcite ; the authors verified explicitly with simple monte carlo generators that @xmath5 is insensitive to the details of the detector response and efficiency .",
    "indeed , they verified that values of @xmath36 are independent of the track detection efficiency when the efficiency is uniform over the measured kinematic range .",
    "if the efficiency is not perfectly uniform across the acceptance , the robustness of @xmath5 is reduced in principle . however , in this work , the acceptance of the measurement is limited to a kinematic range where the efficiency is essentially uniform , and such effects are , therefore , negligible .",
    "we here briefly review the definition and essential properties of this observable .",
    "rather than measuring the event - by - event fluctuations of the ratio of positive and negative particle multiplicities ( in a given acceptance ) , one considers the second moment of the difference between the relative multiplicities @xmath37 and @xmath38 as follows    @xmath39    the poisson limit , @xmath40 of this quantity is equal to :    @xmath41    the `` non - statistical '' or `` dynamical '' fluctuations can thus be expressed as the difference between the above two quantities :    @xmath42    from a theoretical standpoint , @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of two - particle integral correlation functions as @xmath43 , where the terms @xmath44 are ratios of integrals of two and single particle pseudorapidity density functions defined as follows :    @xmath45    the dynamical net charge fluctuations variable @xmath5 is thus basically a measure of the relative correlation strength of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 particles pairs .",
    "note that by construction , these correlations are identically zero for poissonian , or independent particle production . in practice , however , produced particles are partly correlated , either through the production of resonances , string fragmentation , jet fragmentation , or other mechanisms .",
    "the relative and absolute strengths of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 may vary with colliding systems , and beam energy .",
    "in addition , by virtue of charge conservation , the production of @xmath48 pairs is expected to be more strongly correlated than the production of @xmath46 or @xmath47 pairs .",
    "for this reason , it is reasonable to expect @xmath51 to be larger than @xmath49 or @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , one finds experimentally that @xmath53 is actually larger than the sum @xmath54 in @xmath30 and @xmath55 collisions measured at the isr and fnal @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath5 are thus expected and have indeed been found to yield negative values in nucleus - nucleus collisions as well @xcite .",
    "we also note @xmath5 is essentially a measure of the variance of @xmath56 .",
    "this difference is  orthogonal \" to the multiplicity @xmath57 , and thus linearly independent .",
    "there is , therefore , no bias introduced by binning @xmath5 measurements on the basis of the reference multiplicity ( multiplicity within @xmath580.5 ) as discussed below .    as a technical consideration ,",
    "our study of the @xmath5 dependence on collision centrality is carried out in terms of charged particle multiplicity bins , as discussed in detail below . to avoid dependencies on the width of the bins ,",
    "we first determine the values of dynamical fluctuation , @xmath59 , for each value of multiplicity , _ m_. the dynamical fluctuations are then averaged across the selected finite width of the centrality bins with weights corresponding to the relative cross section , @xmath60 , measured at each value of multiplicity .",
    "for example , in the multiplicity range from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , we calculate the average as follows :    @xmath63    this study is based on the notion that if @xmath0 collisions ( or any other @xmath64 system ) trivially consist of a superposition of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions , with no rescattering of the produced secondaries , then @xmath5 is expected to scale inversely to the number of participating nucleons and the number of charged particles , or more appropriately , the number of actual nucleon + nucleon collisions .",
    "one can thus infer that the quantity @xmath65 should be independent of collision centrality under such a scenario .",
    "we shall therefore examine whether indeed the dynamical net charge fluctuations scale with the number of participants , or the invariant multiplicity .",
    "the data used in this analysis were measured using the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) detector during the 2001 , 2002 , 2004 and 2005 data rhic runs at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "they include @xmath0 collisions data collected at @xmath16 19.6 , 62.4 , 130 , and 200 gev , @xmath2 collisions data at @xmath16 62.4 , 200  gev and @xmath30 collisions data measured at @xmath35 200  gev .",
    "the @xmath0 collisions at @xmath16 62.4 , 130 , and 200 gev data and @xmath2 collisions at @xmath16 62.4 and 200 gev were acquired with minimum bias triggers accomplished by requiring a coincidence of two zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) located at 18 m from the center of the interaction region on either side of the star detector . for 19.6 gev data ,",
    "a combination of minimum bias and central triggers was used .",
    "the centrality trigger was achieved using a set of scintillation detectors , called the central trigger barrel ( ctb ) surrounding the main time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "technical descriptions of the star detector and its components are published in technical reports @xcite . for @xmath66 collisions",
    "a minimum bias trigger was used based on the ctb detector .",
    "the analysis carried out in this work is rather similar to that published in the first net charge fluctuation measurement @xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on charged particle track reconstruction measurements performed with the star - tpc .",
    "the tpc is located in a large solenoidal magnetic field producing a uniform axial magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field was set to 0.25  t for @xmath0 collisions at @xmath16 19.6 and 130 gev data , and 0.5 t for @xmath0 and @xmath2 collisions at 62.4 , and 200 gev data .",
    "the increased magnetic field results in a slight reduction of the detection efficiency for charged particle tracks with transverse momenta below 0.2 gev / c , and a modest improvement in momentum resolution .",
    "this analysis used tracks from the tpc with transverse momentum in the range @xmath67 gev / c with pseudorapidity @xmath68 .",
    "systematic effects associated with finite thresholds and momentum dependent efficiency are discussed in section iv .    in order to limit the net charge fluctuations analysis to primary charged particle tracks only ( i.e. particles produced by the collision )",
    ", tracks were selected on the basis of their distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the collision vertex .",
    "dca is defined as the distance between the track and the primary vertex position .",
    "a nominal cut of dca @xmath69 cm was used for results presented in this paper .",
    "systematic effects associated with this cut are discussed in section iv .",
    "events were selected for analysis if their collision vertex lay within a maximum distance from the center of the tpc and they passed a minimum track multiplicity cut ( see below ) .",
    "the vertex position was determined using a fit involving all found tracks .",
    "the maximum distance along the beam axis from the center of the tpc ( also called the z vertex cut ) was set to 75 cm for the @xmath0 19.6 and 130 gev data , further restricted to 25  cm for 62.4 and 200 gev data .",
    "however , a z vertex cut of 30 cm was used in @xmath2 62.4 and 200 gev data .",
    "a maximum of 75 cm was used for the @xmath30 data .",
    "the wide 75 cm cut was used to maximize the event sample used in this analysis .",
    "the observable @xmath5 measured in this analysis ( as described below ) is a robust experimental variable , and is by construction largely insensitive to restricted detection efficiencies provided those efficiencies do not vary dramatically across the detector acceptance .",
    "we indeed find that as long as the longitudinal cut is limited to values below 75 cm , for which the track detection efficiency is rather insensitive to the pseudorapidity of the track , the measured values of @xmath5 are invariant within the statistical uncertainties of the @xmath66 measurements . with a larger cut ,",
    "the efficiencies drop dramatically at large rapidities , and @xmath5 exhibits somewhat larger deviations .",
    "the analyses reported in this paper are based on 100k , 1 m , 144k , 10 m @xmath0 events at 19.6 , 62 , 130 , and 200 gev , respectively , 9 m and 5.5 m @xmath2 events at 62 and 200 gev , and 2.7 m @xmath66 events .",
    "the magnitude of net charge fluctuations is quite obviously subject to change with the total multiplicity of produced charged particles .",
    "it is thus necessary to measure the magnitude of the fluctuations and correlations as a function of the collision centrality .",
    "measurements at the ags , sps , and rhic have shown that there is a strong anti correlation between the number of collision spectators ( i.e. projectile / target nucleons undergoing little or no interaction with target / projectile nucleons ) and the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collisions .",
    "we use the standard collision centrality definition used in other star analyses and base estimates of the collision centrality on the uncorrected multiplicity of charged particle tracks measured within the tpc in the pseudorapidity range -0.5 @xmath70 0.5 .",
    "while low multiplicity events correspond to peripheral ( large impact parameter ) collisions , high multiplicities are associated with central ( small impact parameter ) collisions .",
    "the pseudorapidity range -0.5 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath71 0.5 is used for collision centrality estimates rather than the full range -1.0  @xmath71  @xmath72  @xmath71  1.0 in principle measurable with the tpc , to minimize effects of detector acceptance and efficiency on the collision centrality determination . with the narrow cut - 0.5  @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath71  0.5",
    ", the track detection efficiency is rather insensitive to the position of the collision vertex ( along the beam direction ) in the range @xmath73 cm used in the analysis of @xmath0 at @xmath16 130 gev data , and centrality selection biases are thus negligible .",
    "the efficiency for tracks with 0.5 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath74 on the other hand drops markedly for vertex positions @xmath75 cm .",
    "although the analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath76 collisions at @xmath16 62.4 and 200 gev data were conducted with the narrower @xmath77 cm and @xmath78 cm range , respectively , enabled by the more compact interaction region delivered by the accelerator during these runs , the centrality determination was estimated on the basis of the same pseudorapidity range in order to provide uniform and consistent centrality cuts .",
    "the centrality bins were calculated as a fraction of this multiplicity distribution starting at the highest multiplicities .",
    "the ranges used were 0 - 5% ( most central collisions ) , 5 - 10% , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% , 40 - 50% , 50 - 60% , 60 - 70% , and 70 - 80% ( most peripheral ) for @xmath0 collisions . similarly ,",
    "collision centrality slices used in @xmath2 collisions are 0 - 10% ( most central ) , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% , 40 - 50% and 50 - 60% ( most peripheral ) .",
    "each centrality bin is associated with an average number of participating nucleons , @xmath79 , using glauber monte carlo calculation @xcite . at low multiplicities , the finite detector acceptance and",
    "track detection efficiencies imply estimates of the collision centrality are subject to large errors .",
    "events are included or `` counted '' in this analysis provided a collision vertex is found ( as per the discussion of the previous paragraphs ) and at least one particle is found in the range @xmath80 . while event counting efficiencies are essentially unity for large multiplicity collisions , they are limited ( @xmath74 ) for small multiplicities corresponding to most peripheral collisions .",
    "the limited efficiency stems from finite track and vertex finding efficiencies .",
    "track finding efficiency within the tpc was studied through detailed monte carlo simulations of the detector response with track embedding . for minimal track quality cuts such as those used in this analysis",
    ", one finds the track finding efficiency is of order 95% for @xmath81 gev / c in peripheral collisions .",
    "it reduces to approximately 85% for most central collisions and falls to zero for primary tracks with @xmath82 gev / c .",
    "the efficiencies of positive and negative particles are found to be the same within the statistical errors .",
    "the data shown were integrated for tracks with @xmath83 gev / c , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "note that the minimum @xmath86 cut used in this new analysis is different than that used in the first reported study @xcite .",
    "a value of 0.2 gev / c is used for all measured beam energies and field settings to avoid systematic effects associated with @xmath86 dependent detection efficiency below 0.2 gev / c .",
    "the results presented in this work for 130 gev are nonetheless in agreement with results reported by star in the first measurement of net charge fluctuations in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath16 130 gev @xcite .",
    "simulations reveal the vertex finding efficiency is maximum for total charged particle multiplicity of order 5 and greater in the tpc .",
    "we studied the event counting efficiency of this analysis with a simple simulation based on events generated with the hijing model @xcite , and found the event counting efficiency is maximum for produced charged particle multiplicities ( in the range -0.5 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath71 0.5 ) exceeding 12 .",
    "the vertex counting efficiency is of order 90% for multiplicities larger than 5 , and falls abruptly to zero for smaller values .",
    "for this reason , the analysis presented in this work is limited to reference multiplicities in excess of 10 and 17 for @xmath0 and @xmath2 collisions",
    "where it is deemed minimally biased or unbiased .    in order to eliminate track splitting",
    "we restricted our analysis to charged particle tracks producing more than 20 hits within the tpc where 50% of these hits were included in the final fit of the track .",

    "extensions to less central and peripheral collisions are possible but subject to additional uncertainties raised by small systematic errors involved the collision centrality determination .",
    "as already stated in the introduction , charge conservation and the finite size of the colliding system intrinsically limit the magnitude of the net charge correlations .",
    "intuitively , one expects charge conservation effects to become progressively smaller with increasing charged particle multiplicity .",

    "we observe additionally that the star 19.6 gev measurement is in agreement with a measurement by ceres at the same energy .",
    "the star measurements in @xmath2 collisions show a sharp increase in magnitude .",
    "this difference could partly be attributed to the difference in the number of participating nucleons in @xmath96 and @xmath2 collisions at 0 - 5% and 0 - 10% centralities , respectively .",
    "however , the magnitude of corrected dynamical fluctuations in @xmath2 collisions when scaled by the ratio of number of participants in @xmath2 collisions to number of participants in @xmath0 collisions is - 0.0009 @xmath88 2@xmath98(stat ) @xmath88 6@xmath98(sys ) and -0.001 @xmath88 2@xmath98(stat ) @xmath88 8@xmath99(sys ) at @xmath100 = 62.4 and 200 gev , respectively .",
    "we also note that ceres reports a dramatic reduction in the magnitude of @xmath5 at the lowest energy measured at sps .",
    "we thus conclude that net charge fluctuations corrected for charge conservation show no obvious beam energy dependence in the range from 19.6 to 200 gev .",
    "however , there is a clear system size dependence when comparing @xmath0 to @xmath2 collisions .    below 19.6 gev",
    "there appears to be a decrease in the magnitude of @xmath101 at the lowest sps energies .",
    "difference between star and ceres results may in part stem from differences in pseudorapidity acceptance .",
    "measurements at the sps have shown that particle production at 5 gev and lower energies is dominated by baryons while meson and resonance production become increasingly dominant at energies above 19.6 gev .",
    "this suggests that the change in dynamical net charge fluctuations below 19.6 gev might , in part , be due to this shift in particle production dominance .",
    "it is also conceivable that the differences between the values measured below and above 19.6 gev may result from changes in the collision dynamics and final state interaction effects @xcite .",
    "the observed monotonic reduction of the magnitude of @xmath5 with increasing number of participants , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , arises principally from the progressive dilution of two- particle correlation when the number of particle sources is increased .",
    "in fact , one expects @xmath36 to be strictly inversely proportional to the number of participating nucleons or the produced particle multiplicity if @xmath0 collisions actually involve mutually independent nucleon - nucleon interactions , and rescattering effects may be neglected .",
    "we investigate the possibility of such a scenario by plotting the dynamical fluctuations scaled by the measured particle multiplicity density in pseudorapidity space ( @xmath102 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "data from @xmath0 collisions at various energies are shown with solid symbols while data from @xmath103 collisions at 62.4 and 200 gev are shown with open symbols .",
    "values of @xmath102 used for the scaling correspond to efficiency corrected charged particle multiplicities measured by star @xcite and phobos @xcite .",
    "we note that the correction applied in section a to account for charge conservation , is useful to study the energy dependence of the net charge fluctuations .",
    "its use for centrality , pseudorapidity , and azimuthal dependencies is , however , not warranted given that insufficient data are available to reliably account for charge conservation effects .",
    "also , the applied correction is model dependent , i.e. , assumes charge conservation applies only globally @xcite .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) that the magnitude of @xmath5 scaled by @xmath102 for @xmath0 200 gev data is different from the rest of the data .",
    "this could partly be attributed to the larger multiplicity produced in @xmath0 200 gev .",
    "we additionally observe that all four distributions exhibit the same qualitative behavior : the amplitude @xmath65 is smallest for peripheral collisions , and increases monotonically by @xmath10440% in central collisions in @xmath0 and @xmath2 systems .",
    "the observed @xmath65 increases with the increase in collision centrality . the dashed line in the figure corresponds to charge conservation effect and the solid line to the prediction for a resonance gas .",
    "the figure indicates that dynamical net charge fluctuations , scaled by @xmath102 are rather large .",
    "most central collisions in @xmath105 200 gev approach the prediction for a resonance gas @xcite .",
    "indeed , observed values of @xmath5 are inconsistent with those predicted based on hadronization model of koch _ et al .",
    "given recent observations of elliptic flow , suppression of particle production at high @xmath86 ( @xmath106 @xmath104 0.2 ) , and two - particle correlation functions indicating the formation of a strongly interacting medium ( sqgp ) in @xmath64 collisions at rhic energies , this suggests that the signal predicted by the authors @xcite may be washed out by final state interactions , diffusion , expansion , collision dynamics , string fusion @xcite or other effects @xcite , some of which were discussed in the introduction .",
    "changes in the collision dynamics with increasing centrality are indicated by these data .",
    "such a conclusion should perhaps not come as a surprise in view of the large elliptical flow , and the significant reduction of particle production at high transverse momenta reported by all rhic experiments @xcite .",
    "we also note the phobos collaboration has reported that the charged particle multiplicity per participant nucleon pair rises substantially with increasing number of participants .",
    "they report a value of @xmath107 of order 3.9 in central 200 gev @xmath0 collisions compared to a value of 2.5 in @xmath3 collisions at the same energy @xcite .",
    "this amounts to a 56% increase , similar in magnitude to that of @xmath65 measured in this work .",
    "we thus infer that much of the centrality dependence of @xmath65 is due to the rise of @xmath107 with increasing @xmath79 .    in order to validate this assertion , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) the dynamical fluctuation scaled by the number of participants , @xmath108 as a function of the number of participants .",
    "vertical error bars represent statistical uncertainties .",
    "values of @xmath108 exhibit a small dependence on the collision centrality at all four measured energies in @xmath0 collisions and two energies in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the measured data scaled by the number of participants ( @xmath79 ) are thus consistent with either no or a very weak centrality dependence . however , a definite system size and energy dependence is observed .",
    "this implies that the strength of the ( integrated ) net charge two - particle correlation per participant exhibits essentially no dependence on collision centrality .",
    "we also scale @xmath5 with the number of binary collisions , shown in fig . [ fig3](c ) . while we observe that the datasets follow a common trend , @xmath5 clearly exhibits dramatic collision centrality dependence .",
    "such a dependence is , however , expected given that the measured dynamical net charge fluctuations are dominated by low momentum particles with large cross - section for which binary scaling does not apply .",
    "the statistical errors on @xmath5 and the scaling factors used in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , [ fig3](b ) and [ fig3](c ) are added in quadrature .",
    "pratt _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have argued that the width of longitudinal charge balance functions should significantly narrow in central @xmath0 collision relative to peripheral collisions or @xmath66 collisions due to delayed hadronization following the formation of a qgp .",
    "star has in fact reported that , as predicted , a narrowing of the balance function does occur in central @xmath0 collisions relative to peripheral collisions @xcite .",
    "we note , however , as already pointed out by pratt _",
    "et al . _ and",
    "more recently by voloshin @xcite , radial flow produced in heavy ion collisions induces large position - momentum correlations which manifest themselves in angular , transverse momentum , and longitudinal two - particle correlations .",
    "the observed narrowing of the longitudinal charge balance function therefore can not be solely ascribed to delayed hadronization .",
    "it is thus important to gauge the change in two - particle correlations imparted by radial flow effects . as a first step towards this goal , we present studies of the net charge fluctuation dependence on the integrated pseudorapidity and azimuthal ranges .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) values of @xmath109 measured for different ranges of pseudorapidity , @xmath72 .",
    "in order to compare data measured at different centralities , beam energies and system size , measured values are normalized by the magnitude of @xmath109 for a pseudorapidity range @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) . the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) are from @xmath0 collisions at @xmath28 62.4 and 200 gev , @xmath76 collisions at 62.4 and 200 gev , and @xmath66 data obtained at 200 gev .",
    "one finds the magnitude of the normalized correlation is maximum for the smallest pseudorapidity ranges and decreases monotonically to unity , at all energies and centralities , with increasing pseudorapidity range .",
    "the dynamical fluctuations being essentially a measure of two - particle correlation dominated by the @xmath51 term , one finds , as expected , that the correlation is strongest for small rapidity intervals , and is increasingly diluted ( reduced ) for larger intervals . for example , in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath100 = 200 gev the typical values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are 0.99256 , 0.992518 and 0.996099 , respectively .",
    "one observes that the magnitudes of @xmath112 in @xmath2 collisions at 62.4 and 200 gev are quite different from @xmath0 collisions at comparable energies .",
    "this shows that the collision dynamics in @xmath30 collisions , 0 - 10% @xmath2 and 0 - 5% @xmath0 collisions are significantly different .",
    "indeed , we find the relative magnitude of the correlations measured for @xmath113 increases by nearly 25% for @xmath0 200 gev relative to those in @xmath30 .",
    "note in particular that the slope ( @xmath114 ) in @xmath30 , @xmath115 and @xmath0 systems depends on the correlation length ( in pseudorapidity ) : the shorter the correlation , the larger the slope .",
    "the observed distributions then indicate that the correlation length is shorter for central collisions and for larger systems , in agreement with the observed reduction of the charge balance function @xcite .",
    "the larger values of the slopes observed for most central collisions ( as well as for larger systems ) indicate correlated pairs of negative / positive particles tend to be emitted closer in rapidity than those produced in peripheral @xmath0 or @xmath30 collisions .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have proposed that a reduction of the width of the balance function , and conversely a relative increase of short range ( @xmath113 ) correlations , could signal delayed hadronization . the observed increase in the correlation , reported here",
    ", might however also result from the strong radial flow believed to exist in central @xmath0 collisions .    a comparison of @xmath0 collisions at @xmath28 62.4 , 200 gev ( 30 - 40% central ) is made with @xmath2 collisions at the two energies for 0 - 10% centrality in fig . [",
    "fig5](b ) , as these centralities correspond to approximately same number of participant nucleons .",
    "we observe that the magnitude of normalized correlation is similar for both systems at the same beam energy , thereby suggesting that the magnitude and the width of the charge particle correlation depends mainly on the number of participants and collision energy but little on the colliding systems .    to understand the role of radial flow in net charge fluctuations measured in a limited azimuthal range ( i.e. less than @xmath116 ) , first consider that the magnitude of @xmath5 is , in large part , determined by the abundance of neutral resonances ( such as the @xmath34 ) .",
    "the decay of neutral resonances into pairs of charged particles increases the charged particle multiplicity without affecting the variance of the net charge .",
    "an increasing fraction of neutral resonances ( relative to other particle production mechanisms ) therefore leads to reduced magnitude of @xmath5 . consider additionally that large radial flow velocity should lead to a kinematical focusing of the decay products in a narrow cone .",
    "the opening angle of the cone will decrease with increasing radial velocity boost .",
    "one thus expects that while measuring @xmath36 in a small azimuthal wedge , one should have greater sensitivity to the level of kinematical focusing , i.e. the magnitude of the dynamical net charge fluctuation ( correlation ) should increase with the magnitude of the radial flow velocity .",
    "azimuthal net charge correlations should therefore be rather sensitive to the magnitude of the radial flow velocity .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( b ) display azimuthal net charge correlations integrated over azimuthal angle ranges from 10 to 360 degrees for @xmath0 and @xmath76 collisions at 200 gev .",
    "an azimuthal wedge of , for example , 90 degrees would divide the complete phase space into four sectors , where we denote each sector as a bin .",
    "the figure shows results from nine azimuthal wedges obtained after averaging @xmath5 values for all bins in each wedge .",
    "the errors shown in [ fig6](a ) and ( b ) show the statistical errors of the averaged values for each wedge size .",
    "we also verified that for small wedge angles ( e.g. 90 degrees and smaller ) , the variances of the measured values , for wedges of a given size , have a magnitude similar to the errors of the averages .",
    "data are shown for seven collision centrality bins in @xmath0 collisions in [ fig6](a ) and for five centrality bins in @xmath2 collisions in [ fig6](b ) .",
    "note that the absolute magnitude of the correlation decreases from the most peripheral to the central collisions as a result of progressive dilution with increasing number of participants .",
    "the variation of the shape of the correlation function with the size of the azimuthal acceptance is of greater interest .",
    "one finds the correlation functions measured in the most central collisions decrease monotonically in magnitude with increasing azimuthal wedge size whereas they exhibit a more complicated behavior for most peripheral collisions .",
    "one expects @xmath36 to be rather small for very small acceptance ( azimuthal wedge ) , i.e. , when the size of the acceptance is smaller than the typical correlation length .",
    "this explains why @xmath117 decreases sharply for small angles in peripheral collisions .",
    "it is remarkable , however , to note that this behavior is not observed in most central collisions with the angular ranges considered thereby indicating a change in the particle correlation length qualitatively consistent with the reduction of the balance function in central collision    already reported by star @xcite .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows a comparison of @xmath0 and @xmath2 collisions at similar number of participating nucleons .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath5 with respect to azimuthal angle , @xmath118 , is similar for similar number of participating nucleons in both systems with best agreement for collisions with more than 20 participants .",
    "the agreement for the most peripheral collisions studied is weaker , but we speculate that vertex inefficiencies and fluctuations in the number of participants should account for this weaker agreement .",
    "we also observe a change in shape with centrality .",
    "both systems show similar monotonic dependence for central collisions , whereas , the magnitude of @xmath36 reaches a maximum for a small azimuthal wedge for peripheral collisions .",
    "the error bars shown here are statistical only .",
    "while @xmath5 is a robust observable and shown to exhibit essentially no dependence on efficiencies , it may nonetheless be subject to limited systematic effects associated with the measurement process .",
    "we investigated dependencies on the longitudinal position of interaction vertex ( z - vertex ) , the effect of resonance feed downs , event pile - up , track reconstruction and @xmath86 resolution .",
    "the dependence of @xmath5 on the longitudinal position of the interaction vertex might arise because of the restricted acceptance of the tpc on which these analyses are based .",
    "we thus measured @xmath5 by binning events according to the z - vertex in steps of 5 cm for positions varying in ranges @xmath119 cm and found deviations in @xmath5 to be 1% or less .",
    "the @xmath5 measurement presented in this paper is meant to be representative of particles produced by @xmath0 , @xmath2 or @xmath30 collisions . by design ,",
    "one thus seeks to eliminate effects from secondary decays ( e.g. , @xmath120 ) or secondary particle production within the detector .",
    "this is accomplished by limiting the analysis to tracks that appear to originate from the collision vertex .",
    "indeed a cut of track distance - of - closest approach ( dca ) to the collision vertex with a value of 3 cm is used to select primary particles and reduce those produced by decays and secondary interactions .",
    "the large value of dca used in this analysis is due to finite dca resolution and is also intended to maintain large track detection efficiency , which is needed especially for the @xmath5 analysis with respect to the longitudinal and azimuthal acceptance .",
    "however , with a large value of the dca cut , one ends up counting particles produced by weak - decays ( e.g. , @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) as primary particles .",
    "in particular , with kaons ( @xmath123 ) representing a small fraction of all neutral particles produced , one expects pions from decays of these particles to increase the accepted charged particle multiplicity but with only a minor impact on the variance of the measured net charge .",
    "this implies @xmath5 should be subject to a systematic decrease in magnitude when accepting weak - decay feed down .",
    "we thus studied @xmath36 for smaller dca cuts of 2 cm and found @xmath117 decreases by roughly 1% at all collision centralities . @xmath123 and",
    "@xmath121 have a decay length in excess of 2.7 cm",
    ". given the rather limited resolution of the measurement , the dca of the decay products is spread to values over a range extending more than 3 cm and , thereby , form a modest background to the primary particles .",
    "assuming the contributions of @xmath123 and @xmath121 are roughly uniform within the 3 cm dca cut considered , we expect that a 2 cm dca cut reduces the background by approximately 30% .",
    "we observe this change of cut leads to a 1% reduction in the magnitude of @xmath5 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath123 and @xmath121 contamination amounts to a contribution of a few percent only .",
    "another important source of secondary tracks not completely eliminated by the dca cut are electrons / positrons .",
    "while a finite electron primary yield is expected from decays of d - mesons and b - mesons , from dalitz decays of @xmath124 and @xmath72 , the bulk of electrons / positrons observed in the tpc are from secondary interactions leading to pair production , and compton photo - electron production .",
    "elimination of electrons / positrons is , in principle , partly achievable based on cuts on track @xmath125 .",
    "however , because electrons and pions of low momenta experience similar energy loss in the tpc gas , a cut on the track @xmath125 also eliminates a large amount of pions thereby effectively creating a `` hole '' in the pion acceptance ( with respect to their momentum ) .",
    "we thus carried out the analysis reported in this paper by including the electrons / positrons . again in this case , since electrons and positrons are typically created in pairs , this may lead to an increase in the integrated charged particle multiplicity with little impact on the net charge variance .",
    "one thus expects inclusion of the electrons should produce a systematic shift in the magnitude of @xmath5 . to verify this we carried out a measurement of @xmath5 when electrons ( and consequently also pions ) are eliminated on the basis of @xmath125 cut .",
    "the @xmath125 cut is accomplished using the truncated mean of the measured @xmath125 samples along the track and the track momentum .",
    "tracks were excluded whenever the measured @xmath125 fell within two standard deviations of the mean value expected for electrons of a given momentum .",
    "we found that when electrons are eliminated , @xmath117 increases by as much as 3.5% in magnitude .",
    "this shift may however not be entirely due to the suppression of electrons .",
    "indeed , by cutting electrons , one also reduces pion acceptance in transverse momentum .",
    "we have reported in section iii.c . that @xmath5 exhibit a modest dependence on the size of integrated longitudinal and azimuthal acceptances . however , a similar ( but weaker ) dependence on the transverse momentum is expected .",
    "it is thus plausible the shift by 3.5% may in part result from a reduction of pion acceptance .",
    "electron contamination is thus considered a source of systematic error of the order of 3.5% in our measurement of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath2 data acquired during runs iv and v were subject to pile- up effects associated with large machine luminosity obtained during those years .",
    "the pile - up may result in two collisions being mistaken as one and treated as such , thereby leading to artificially large multiplicities and increased variances .",
    "therefore , in order to reject pile - up events , dip angle cuts were introduced in the present analysis .",
    "the dip angle is defined as the angle between the particle momentum and the drift direction , @xmath126 .",
    "the dip angle cut is based on the average dip angle distribution of all tracks in a given event .",
    "we found the dip angle is correlated with the vertex position and features a width distribution which is gaussian at low luminosities .",
    "we thus reject pile - up events that are beyond two standard deviations of the mean of the distribution for a particular centrality and vertex position .",
    "we found @xmath5 changes by less than 1% when the dip angle cut is used .",
    "we also checked the effect of efficiency variation within the acceptance of interest .",
    "the efficiency is known in particular to progressively reduce from a maximum value for @xmath127 200",
    "mev / c to zero for @xmath128100 mev / c .",
    "we determined an upper bound of the effect of @xmath86 dependence by measuring @xmath5 with @xmath86 thresholds of 150 mev / c and 200 mev / c .",
    "we found changes of @xmath5 are typically negligible within the statistical accuracy of our measurement and amount to at the most 1.5% .",
    "total systematic error contribution increases from 8% to 9% from central to peripheral collisions in @xmath0 and @xmath2 collisions at @xmath1 200 gev .",
    "similarly , systematic errors amount to 8% in peripheral collisions and 7% in central collisions in @xmath0 and @xmath103 collisions at @xmath1 62.4 gev .",
    "the systematic errors on @xmath5 from different sources mentioned above are added linearly .",
    "we have presented measurements of dynamical net charge fluctuations in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath16 19.6 , 62.4 , 130 , 200 gev , @xmath2 collisions at @xmath16 62.4 , 200 gev and @xmath30 collisions at @xmath35 200 gev , using the measure @xmath5 .",
    "we observed that the dynamical net charge fluctuations are non vanishing at all energies and exhibit a modest dependence on beam energy in the range 19.6 @xmath129 200 gev for @xmath0 as well as @xmath2 collisions .",
    "dynamical fluctuations measured in this work are in quantitative agreement with measurements by the ceres collaboration at @xmath100 = 17.2 gev and phenix collaboration at @xmath100 = 130 gev .",
    "however , measurements by ceres at lower beam energy ( @xmath13017.2 gev ) exhibit much smaller dynamical net charge fluctuations perhaps owing to a transition from baryon to meson dominance in the sps energy regime",
    ". we also found the dynamical net charge fluctuations violate the trivial @xmath6 scaling expected for nuclear collisions consisting of independent nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "however , one finds that @xmath5 scaled by the number of participants exhibits little dependence on collision centrality but shows modest dependence on collision systems .",
    "measured values of @xmath5 are inconsistent for all systems and energies with the predictions of the qgp hadronization model of koch _ et al .",
    "given the reported observations of a strongly interacting medium in @xmath64 collisions at rhic , this suggests that the assumptions of the hadronization by koch _",
    "_ are invalid , or that some final state interaction process washes out the predicted signal .",
    "scaled dynamical net charge fluctuations @xmath65 grow by up to 40% from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "we speculated that the centrality dependence arises , in part due to the large radial collective flow produced in @xmath0 collisions and proceeded to study fluctuations as a function of azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity .",
    "our analysis showed dynamical fluctuations exhibit a strong dependence on rapidity and azimuthal angular ranges which could be attributed in part to radial flow effects .",

    "<S> we present measurements of net charge fluctuations in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 19.6 , 62.4 , 130 , and 200 gev , @xmath2 collisions at @xmath1 62.4 , 200 gev , and @xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 200 gev using the dynamical net charge fluctuations measure @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the dynamical fluctuations are non - zero at all energies and exhibit a modest dependence on beam energy . a weak system size dependence is also observed . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the collision centrality dependence of the net charge fluctuations and find that dynamical net charge fluctuations violate @xmath6 scaling , but display approximate @xmath7 scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the azimuthal and rapidity dependence of the net charge correlation strength and observe strong dependence on the azimuthal angular range and pseudorapidity widths integrated to measure the correlation . </S>"
