    "this is the third paper of a series whose purpose is to prepare for the projected final summary review of our 1991 - 2001 hubble space telescope experiment to determine the hubble constant by calibrating the absolute magnitude of type ia supernovae .",
    "the method used in this observing program has been to measure cepheid distances to the host galaxies by ( 1 ) correcting the raw cepheid photometric data for reddening to determine the true distance moduli of the parent galaxies using an adopted cepheid period - luminosity relation and ( 2 ) correcting the sne data for their own intrinsic and extrinsic reddening and absorption values , plus all known second - parameter corrections for light - curve inhomogeneities .",
    "the first two papers of this preparatory series concerned revisions in the cepheid p - l relation and its lack of universality from galaxy to galaxy , showing significant differences in the p - l slope and zero point between the galaxy @xcite and the lmc @xcite .    following the emergence of sneia as powerful standard candles @xcite",
    ", it became increasingly clear as the accuracy of the data became better that the dispersion in the sneia absolute magnitude at maximum became smaller with each advance in the accuracy of the data , and also with the application of corrections for light - curve inhomogeneities that had been found and subsequently systematically improved ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the purpose of this third paper of the series is to update the discussion by @xcite on reddening , absorption , and second parameter corrections ( decline rate , color , galaxy type ) to the sneia light curves , and to determine a revised hubble diagram based on these corrections using the totality of the modern sneia photometry available to date .",
    "the sample here consists of 124 supernovae compared with the sample of 35 sneia used by @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is this :    \\(1 ) the photometric data for 124 sneia are compiled in   [ sec : data ] from the extensive literature , together with the types and recession velocities of their host galaxies ( table  [ tab : sn1 ] ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the _ intrinsic _ colors @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( i.e.  35 days after @xmath13 maximum ) , and @xmath20 are derived in   [ sec : color ] from 34 normal sneia which have occurred in e / s0 galaxies or in the outer regions of spiral galaxies and which are assumed  after correction for galactic reddening  to suffer no reddening in their host galaxies .",

    "the overly bright sn1997cw is suspicious not so much because its photometry begins only 16 days after @xmath13 maximum , but because it was classified as sne-91 t @xcite , which is now revised to sne-91t/99aa @xcite .",

    "thus a few of the `` normal '' sneia may actually belong to the elusive class of sne-99aa without having as extreme luminosities like sn1997cw , 1998ab , and 1999dq .    as shown by the equations in figure  [ fig : absorption : mabs ] the resulting values of @xmath320 are about 3.6 , 2.4 , and 1.2",

    "it is also satisfactory that they agree quite well with those by other authors cited above .    if one assumes that the highly reddened sn1996ai is a normal sneia with average luminosity and that its peculiar motion is @xmath323 , one finds @xmath324 from this single object .    the solutions in table  [ tab : other : dm15r ] for @xmath302 and @xmath325 imply a ratio @xmath326 , which may be compared with @xmath327 from equation  ( [ eq : color : evibvhost ] ) .",
    "the small error of the latter value is due to the fact that its determination is independent of any assumed value of @xmath299 , which is notoriously difficult to determine .",

    "catastrophic collapse eventually occurs , but with different gestation times .",
    "hence , the delay times differ for progenitor formation to explosion , according to the process .",
