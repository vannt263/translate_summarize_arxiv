    "entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information science and sources of photonic entanglement are key enabling technologies for quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "entangled photons can be generated from a wide range of single- , or heralded - photon , sources  @xcite , or directly via interactions in materials with non linear optical susceptibility , such as spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) . a simple way to generate polarisation entangled photon pairs consists of employing a type - ii non linear crystal  @xcite , which allows one to generate pairs of photons with orthogonal polarisation and then exploit the conservation of energy and momentum to produce entanglement .",
    "however , a constraint arises when we want to use a collinear configuration or waveguide crystals  @xcite , for example , to increase the source brightness .",
    "the simplest approach is to use a balanced beam splitter , in which case the two photons take different paths half of the time .",
    "hence , one immediately has only @xmath0 efficiency and the scheme only works in post - selection .",
    "we can no longer deterministically separate the entangled photons to obtain polarisation entangled pairs , as they are indistinguishable in all the other degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "a solution to this can be found by engineering two different type ii phase matching conditions , for non - degenerate pairs of photons , in the same crystal  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we report on an extension of a scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which exploits energy conservation and degenerate photon pairs in spdc along with readily available fibre components such as dense wavelength division multiplexer ( dwdm ) filters . however , in our case , the picosecond pulsed regime allows one to generate narrowband photons and overcome synchronisation problems .",
    "we can also adapt the filtering bandwidth to obtain spectrally separable photons that are a requirement for more complex quantum communication tasks .",
    "in the present work , the realisation of the entangled photon pair is , as previously mentioned , based on a type ii spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) process in a non linear crystal . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to generate entangled photon pairs with minimised losses ( _ i.e. _ the collinear photons are deterministically separated ) , it is necessary to be in a degenerated configuration .",
    "a dense wavelength division multiplexer ( dwdm ) with a filter wavelength slightly detuned from the central one , has the role of separating the photons . at the two outputs , labelled @xmath1 ( alice ) and @xmath2 ( bob ) ,",

    "type ii quasi phase matching generates two orthogonally polarised photons .    a birefringent medium ,",
    "e.g. a polarisation maintaining single mode fibre ( pmf)is used to compensate the temporal walk - off introduced by the ln birefringence between the two orthogonally polarised photons .",
    "the photon pairs are directly coupled into the pmf with an efficiency of 50% , the slow and fast axis as well as the length of the fibre ( 1,44 m ) are adapted to compensate the temporal walk - off introduced by the crystal . to separate the two photons ,",
    "a circulator is placed at the output of the pmf , a fibre bragg grating ( fbg ) with a 200pm bandwidth is connected at the second port of the circulator , thus reflecting the filtered light towards the third port .",
    "the central wavelength of the filter is detuned by @xmath24 nm compared to the photons degeneracy wavelength .",
    "this detuning is such that one and only one photon per pair is selected by the filter",
    ". a second narrow filter ( fwhm = 200 pm ) , used to eliminate residual distinguishabilities , can be added in bob s arm .",
    "the photons reflected by the fbg are sent to alice and the transmitted photons are sent to bob , producing the state defined in equation  [ eq : state ] .",
    "the polarisation analysers are composed by a half - wave plate , a polarising beam splitter and a gated ingaas avalanche photodiode ( apd , i d quantique id210 )",

    "this is related to the spectral properties of the photon pair , and it s a peculiar effect of the non linear material combined with the pump pulse shape and the filter shape . placing a second narrowband filter on bob s arm allows one to improve the visibility up to 98% for both the natural creation basis ( hv ) and the diagonal ( da ) basis .",

    "currently , the filtering is the major disadvantage with such an approach .",
    "the need for a second filter on bob s arm does nt arise in cw regime as the correlations in frequency between the two photons is perfect , i.e. the tilt angle of the jsi is 45 . to overcome the double filtering in the pulsed regime",
    ", one could look at engineering the phase matching conditions in such a way that the jsi orientation is diagonal , which would lead to a perfect overlap between the entangled photons spectra . in either case ,",
    "the filtering can be easily replaced by ultra - dwdms , which have a bandwidth of 25ghz , which is well suited to such a system .",
    "we have demonstrated a simple way to generate polarisation entangled photon pairs based on collinear type - ii ppln phase matching in the pulsed regime .",
    "the high quality of the entanglement is demonstrated by visibilities , in both bases , above @xmath25 .",
    "the pulsed regime also allows one to have temporally well - defined photons for synchronisation with other sources and the filters allow one to deterministically separate the pairs and erase the frequency correlations .",
