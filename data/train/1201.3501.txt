    "( [ 11 ] ) is invariant under the substitution @xmath23 , we can simply assume @xmath24 in the following",
    ". the two - piece string is sketched in fig .  1 .",
    "this model was introduced in 1990 @xcite ; cf .",
    "also the related paper @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy was calculated for various length ratios of the pieces .    from a physical point of view",
    ", there is a well- founded hope that this simple model can give insight in the properties of the vacuum state in two - dimensional quantum field theories in general .",
    "the issue of main interest for us here is , however , not to discuss possible practical applications of the model but rather to emphasize the great adaptivity the model has with respect to various regularization methods .",
    "the system is remarkably easy to regularize - this circumstance , in fact , supporting the expectation that the model may carry more physical information than has hitherto been recognized . in the paper @xcite already mentioned , we made use of a cutoff regularization method whereby a function @xmath25 with @xmath26 a small positive parameter was introduced .",
    "a second regularization method is to make use of complex contour integrations . to our knowledge",
    "this method was first applied to the composite string model by brevik and elizalde @xcite .",
    "a separate chapter is devoted to this model in elizalde s book on zeta functions @xcite .",
    "one great advantage of this method is that the _ multiplicities _ of the zeros of the dispersion function are automatically taken care of .",
    "third , one may regularize the system by using zeta function methods - as we know , stuart dowker has made significant contributions to zeta function theory and related topics in mathematical physics . for the specific piecewise uniform string , it is the hurwitz kind of zeta function that comes into play .    instead of assuming only two pieces in the composite string",
    ", one can imagine that the string is composed of @xmath27 pieces , all of the same length , such that the type i materials and the type ii materials are alternating . maintaining the same relativistic property as before , one will find that also this kind of system is easily regularizable and tractable analytically in general .",
    "there are by now several papers devoted to the study of the composite string in its various facets ; cf",
    ". refs .  @xcite . as for possible physical applications of the model",
    ", we may also mention the paper of lu and huang @xcite , discussing the casimir energy for a composite green - schwarz superstring .",
    "it ought to be stressed again that the regularizability of the string model relies upon the relativistic condition ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "if this condition were abandoned , the formalism would at once be ambiguous and its predictions obscure .",
    "an interesting point in this context is to note the close relationship with the electromagnetic theory in a dielectric medium when the product of the permittivity and the permeability is equal to one ( sometimes called an isorefractive medium ) .",
    "while casimir theories for isorefractive media are easily tractable , the corresponding theory for an ordinary ( non - isorefractive ) medium would be difficult to construct . for recent papers along these lines , the reader may consult refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there have been further developments of the composite string theory in recent years .",
    "we may mention the extension to the so - called quantum spring model @xcite , where a helix boundary condition for a scalar massless field is imposed .",
    "the casimir forces in the longitudinal and transverse directions for the spring are calculated , using zeta regularization , and the analogue to hooke s law in elasticity is recovered when the pitch of the spring is small .",
    "higher dimensions are also envisaged @xcite . the fermionic casimir effect with helix boundary condition",
    "is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the scalar field with a helix torus boundary condition in higher dimension is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a proposal for future work",
    ", we mention that there may be a connection between the phases of the piecewise uniform ( super ) string and the bekenstein - hawking entropy associated with this string .",
    "the entropy , as known , can be derived by counting black hole microstates , and it is natural to expect that the deviation from spatial homogeneity present in the composite string model could influence that sort of calculations .",
    "we ought here to mention the interesting analogy that seems to exist between the composite string model and the so - called quantum star graph model .",
    "@xcite recently studied vacuum energy and casimir forces in one - dimensional quantum graphs ( pistons ) , and found that the piston force could be attractive or repulsive depending on the number of edges .",
    "it may be that the mathematical similarities between these two kinds of theories reflect a deeper physical similarity also .",
    "this remains to be explored .",
    "another more recent paper of harrison and kirsten @xcite studies the zeta functions of quantum graphs .",
    "as mentioned above , the main part of this paper is an updated review of the main properties of the composite string model , at zero , and also at finite , temperature , making use of the different contour regularization methods .",
    "the convenience of the recursion formula in the @xmath27-case , in particular , as treated in sec .",
    "6 , is in our opinion worth attention .",
    "the quantum theory of the two - piece string for the simplifying limiting case of very small tension ratio @xmath28 between the two pieces is highlighted , and the hagedorn temperature is given for this kind of model .    as a novel development ,",

    "this kind of potential comes from the two - piece string energy in the limiting case of extreme string tension , the string length ratio being replaced formally by a nondimensional length .",
    "the expression for the potential has to be simplified , however , in order to give real solutions for the field .",
    "we present the green function for the problem , and give the expression for the field energy density as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath33 .",

    "again , if the isorefractive ( or relativistic ) condition were removed in the electromagnetic case , the regularization procedure would be rather difficult to deal with , as the contact term to be subtracted off would then depend on which of the media one chooses for this purpose .",
    "we recall that the quantization procedure in sec .",
    "5 was based upon two simplifying conditions .",
    "first , the tension ratio @xmath28 was taken to be small .",
    "this assumption implies that the eigenvalue spectrum for the composite string becomes simple : there are two branches , the first branch corresponding to @xmath269 and the second branch corresponding to @xmath270 , with @xmath271 an integer .",
    "our second assumption was that @xmath44 is an integer .",
    "we considered branch only , in detail .",
    "one may ask : what is the hagedorn temperature @xmath272 for the composite string ?",
    "this temperature , introduced by hagedorn in the context of strong interactions , is the temperature above which the free energy is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "making use of the meinardus theorem @xcite this topic was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the first branch we found @xmath273",
    "the important point here is that in the point mass limit , @xmath77 , one gets @xmath274 , or @xmath275 .",
    "the hagedorn temperature diverges in this limit .    our second theme in this paper , the quantum field theory of the scalar field @xmath216 in sect .",
    "7 , is formally related to the string problem in the extreme case when the tension ratio @xmath40 .",
    "this simple model deserves a study in its own right , as an example of the field theoretical models currently studied in the literature .",

    "<S> the main part of this paper is to present an updated review of the casimir energy at zero and finite temperature for the transverse oscillations of a piecewise uniform closed string . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of three different regularizations : the cutoff method , the complex contour integration method , and the zeta - function method . </S>",
    "<S> the string model is relativistic , in the sense that the velocity of sound is for each string piece set equal to the velocity of light . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> the theory is analogous to the electromagnetic theory in a dielectric medium in which the product of permittivity and permeability is equal to unity ( an isorefractive medium ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how the formalism works for a two - piece string , and for a 2n - piece string , and show how in the latter case a compact recursion relation serves to facilitate the formalism considerably . </S>",
    "<S> the casimir energy turns out to be negative , and the more so the larger the number of pieces in the string . </S>",
    "<S> the two - piece string is quantized in d - dimensional spacetime , in the limit when the ratio between the two tensions is very small . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the free energy and other thermodynamic quantities , demonstrate scaling properties , and comment finally on the meaning of the hagedorn critical temperature for the two - piece string.thereafter , as a novel development we present a scalar field theory for a real field in three - dimensional space in a potential rising linearly with a longitudinal coordinate @xmath0 in the interval @xmath1 , and which is thereafter held constant on a horizontal plateau . </S>",
    "<S> the potential is taken as a rough model of the two - piece string potential under simplifying conditions , when the length ratio between the pieces is replaced formally with the mentioned length parameter @xmath0 .    </S>",
