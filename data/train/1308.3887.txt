    "@xcite the description of a spin - fluctuation based pairing mechanism in iron based pnictide superconductors argues for a leading @xmath9 pairing instability based on @xmath10 nesting between the electron and hole fermi surface sheets.@xcite the alkali doped iron chalcogenides therefore violate such arguments since the absence of hole pockets imply that the relevant nesting vector for these systems is not @xmath10 but the weaker @xmath11 nesting between electron pockets at the m points .",
    "theoretical calculations for the superconducting ground state are currently inconclusive and predictions have been made for both @xmath3-wave @xcite and @xmath4-wave @xcite pairing symmetry .",
    "experiments have found evidence for the absence of a nodal structure in the superconducting gap.@xcite this does not identify the gap symmetry in alkali iron selenides since neither @xmath3-wave nor @xmath4-wave symmetry possess any symmetry enforced nodes at @xmath8 for this fermi surface .",
    "however , a symmetry based argument has shown that inclusion of @xmath12 dispersion would require the @xmath3-wave symmetry to possess nodes in the gap structure.@xcite the case for @xmath4-wave superconducting gap is further supported by angular resolved photoemission ( arpes ) measurements in ref .",

    "scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) experiments have observed a double gap feature in the local density of states ( ldos).@xcite    previous theoretical studies of impurity effects in potassium doped iron selenide superconductors k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 have investigated the role of nonmagnetic impurities in identifying the characteristic difference between superconducting gap symmetries.@xcite for example , zhu _ et al._@xcite studied the effects of repulsive nonmagnetic impurity potentials using a t - matrix approach for various gap symmetries , and found that sub - gap bound states close to gap edge are generated for @xmath3-wave but not for @xmath4-wave ( next - nearest neighbor pairing ) superconductivity .",
    "another calculation based on a three orbital tight - binding hamiltonian and the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) method found that only attractive nonmagnetic impurity potentials generate sub - gap bound states for @xmath3-wave gap symmetry.@xcite this discrepancy between theoretical models for impurity bound states in iron - based superconductors has been recently pointed out to arise naturally for these systems due to strong sensitivity to the particular band structure and superconducting gap function.@xcite therefore , it seems important to use realistic five - band models with self - consistently generated superconducting pairing in order to minimize the effects of free parameters within the various models .    in this work",

    "we focus on nearest neighbor ( nn ) @xmath3-wave and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) @xmath4-wave superconducting states since these are the leading candidates for the ground state gap symmetry in these materials .",
    "note that in the absence of a hole pocket around the @xmath13 point , the nnn @xmath4-wave symmetry does not possess a sign change in the superconducting gap , and the only difference between the two gap symmetries is the absence ( presence ) of a relative sign difference between the gap on the electron pockets at the m points for @xmath4-wave ( @xmath3-wave ) pairing .",
    "we find that sufficiently strong nonmagnetic scatterers lead to sub - gap bound states both for repulsive and attractive impurity potentials for the case of @xmath3-wave pairing .",
    "the location of the bound states depend rather strongly on the electron doping and approach zero bias for increased electron doping .",
    "hence , we propose to measure the ldos for maximally electron doped k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 samples to clearly identify the possible existence of sub - gap bound states .    for magnetic impurities ,",
    "bound states exist within the superconducting gap for both @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave pairing as expected .",
    "it may , however , be too naive to split up the scatterers into nonmagnetic and magnetic since , as we show , in the case of @xmath3-wave superconductivity putative nonmagnetic impurity potentials may take advantage of significant coulomb correlations to locally pin magnetic fluctuations and generate magnetic droplets around the impurity sites .",
    "this mechanism can be understood as a local stoner instability and has been discussed extensively in the literature.@xcite the existence of impurity - induced order may be particularly relevant to alkali doped iron chalcogenides due to the evidence of significant electronic interactions@xcite and the likely presence disordered vacancies ( which in the vacancy ordered state induce the bafm order ) in the superconducting regions .",
    "we note that the presence of impurity - induced magnetic order is only relevant for @xmath3-wave pairing , and hence our conclusion of absence ( presence ) of sub - gap bound states for @xmath3-wave ( @xmath4-wave ) pairing symmetry remains robust .",

    "<S> measurements of the local density of states near impurities can be useful for identifying the superconducting gap structure in alkali doped iron chalcogenide superconductors k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 . here , we study the effects of nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities within a nearest neighbor @xmath3-wave and next - nearest neighbor @xmath4-wave superconducting state . for both repulsive and attractive nonmagnetic impurities </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that sub - gap bound states exist only for @xmath3-wave superconductors with the positions of these bound states depending rather sensitively on the electron doping level . </S>",
    "<S> further , for such disorder coulomb interactions can lead to local impurity - induced magnetism in the case of @xmath3-wave superconductivity . for magnetic impurities , both @xmath4-wave and @xmath3-wave superconducting states support sub - gap bound states . </S>",
    "<S> the above results can be explained by a simple analytic model that provides a semi - quantitative understanding of the variation of the impurity bound states energies as a function of impurity potential and chemical doping level . </S>"
