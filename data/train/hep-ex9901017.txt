    "the lifetimes of b hadrons depend both on the strength of the b quark coupling to the lighter c and u quarks , and on the dynamics of b hadron decay . in the spectator model of heavy hadron decay",
    ", the decay of the heavy quark is unaffected by the presence of the other light quarks in the hadron , so the lifetimes of all hadrons containing the same heavy quark are predicted to be equal .",
    "this model fails badly for the charm hadrons , where the lifetime of the @xmath49 is more than 2.5 times the lifetime of the @xmath50 @xcite , but is a better approximation for the b hadrons , due to the larger mass of the b quark @xcite .",
    "the difference between the  and   lifetimes is expected to be at most @xmath51 , and depends on the details of the various non - spectator processes contributing to their decay .",
    "measurements at the level of a few percent or better are therefore needed to test this prediction and probe the dynamics of b hadron decays .",
    "experimentally , most measurements of the  and  lifetimes have been performed using semileptonic decays , fully or partially reconstructing the decay products to distinguish  from  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are limited due to the small branching ratios and limited reconstruction efficiencies for the selected final states .",
    "a more inclusive approach is to reconstruct resolvable secondary vertices from b hadron decays , since their long lifetimes lead to significant decay lengths @xcite . in these analyses ,",
    "the  and  decays are distinguished by reconstructing the charge of the secondary vertex .",
    "this technique results in much larger data samples , and offers the best hope of improving the precision .",
    "a measurement of this type is presented in the first part of this paper .",
    "inclusive samples of  decays can also be used to search for cp and cpt violating effects .",
    "although cp violation has so far been seen only in the neutral kaon system , possibly large effects are expected also in the b - meson system , so it is worthwhile to search for them even with the relatively small data samples collected at lep . in the -  system",
    "the weak eigenstates @xmath52 and @xmath53 differ from the mass eigenstates @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 where the parameters  and @xmath57 parameterise indirect cp violation and cpt violation respectively @xcite .",
    "these parameters can be studied using semi - leptonic b hadron decays , and limits of a few @xmath58 have been set on both quantities @xcite .",
    "a non - zero value of  is also expected to produce time dependent asymmetries in inclusive  _ vs. _ inclusive  decays @xcite .",
    "this provides a second method to look for cp violating effects in b decays , and such an asymmetry is searched for in the second part of this paper . the same data sample is also used to test a basic prediction of cpt invariance , that the lifetimes of b and  hadrons are equal .    a brief overview of the analysis strategies is presented in section  [ s : over ] , followed by a review of the data and monte carlo samples in section  [ s : datamc ] .",
    "the parts common to both  and  lifetime and cp(t ) violation analyses , namely the  event tagging and b hadron production flavour tagging , are discussed in sections  [ s : btag ] and  [ s : bprod ] .",
    "the lifetime analysis is described in detail in section  [ s : blife ] and the cp and cpt violation analyses in section  [ s : cpt ] .",
    "finally , all the results and conclusions are summarised in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "the analyses exploit the characteristic topology of the @xmath0 decay : two back - to - back jets aligned along the direction of the thrust axis .",
    "the event is divided into two hemispheres by the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis and containing the @xmath59 interaction point .",
    "one hemisphere ( the ` tag hemisphere ' t ) is tagged as containing a b decay using either a displaced secondary vertex or a high momentum lepton .",
    "the production flavour of the b hadron in the tag hemisphere ( whether it originated from a b quark or @xmath60 antiquark ) is also determined , using jet , vertex and lepton charge information .",
    "the unbiased b decay in the other hemisphere ( the ` measurement hemisphere ' m ) is used to perform the measurement of b hadron decay time .",
    "the decay time of the b hadron in the measurement hemisphere is determined by reconstructing its decay vertex and energy . in the  and   lifetime analysis ,",
    "this decay vertex is required to be significantly separated from the event primary vertex , and very strict requirements are placed on the confidence with which tracks are assigned to either this secondary vertex or the primary vertex .",
    "these requirements lead to a final data sample of only about 10000 reconstructed vertices with well determined charge .",
    "the reconstructed decay times of the b hadrons giving rise to these charged and neutral vertices are then used to determine the lifetimes of the  and  mesons , employing the excess decay length technique  @xcite to eliminate biases caused by the separated vertex requirement .",
    "the correlation of the sign of reconstructed charged b hadrons in the measurement hemisphere with the production flavour of the b hadron in the tag hemisphere is used to measure the probability of mis - reconstructing the b hadron charge .    in the cp(t )",
    "violation analysis , only the decay time of the b hadron in the measurement hemisphere is reconstructed .",
    "the charge is not determined , so no strict requirements are placed on the quality or separation of the b hadron vertex , leading to a much larger data sample of about 400000 events .",
    "the production flavour of this b hadron is inferred from that of the b hadron in the tag hemisphere , aided by information in the measurement hemisphere , and taking into account the effects of  and  mixing .",
    "the decay time distribution of decays tagged as b or @xmath60 hadrons is then used to search for cp and cpt violating effects .",
    "the opal detector is well described elsewhere @xcite . the analyses described here rely mainly on charged particle track reconstruction using the central tracking chambers and the silicon microvertex detector .",
    "the b hadron lifetime analysis requires excellent pattern recognition , and uses only data taken between 1993 and 1995 with the upgraded silicon microvertex detector measuring tracks in both the @xmath61-@xmath62 and @xmath61-@xmath63 planes along the @xmath64 beam direction and @xmath65 pointing towards the centre of the lep ring .",
    "the polar and azimuthal angles are denoted by @xmath66 and @xmath62 , and the origin is taken to be the centre of the detector . ]",
    "the cp(t ) violation analysis also uses data taken in 1991 and 1992 with the original silicon microvertex detector measuring only in the @xmath61-@xmath62 plane @xcite .",
    "hadronic  decays were selected using standard criteria @xcite , additionally requiring at least 7  charged tracks in the event .",
    "the thrust axis polar angle @xmath67 was calculated using charged tracks and electromagnetic clusters not associated to any track . to ensure the event was well contained within the acceptance of the detector , the thrust axis direction was required to satisfy @xmath68 .",
    "the complete event selection has an efficiency of about 88% , and selected a total of 2390221  events in the 199395 data and 754372  events in the 1991 - 92 data",
    ".    charged tracks and electromagnetic calorimeter clusters with no associated track were combined into jets using a cone algorithm  @xcite , with a cone half angle of 0.65rad and a minimum jet energy of 5gev .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath69 of each track was defined relative to the axis of the jet containing it , where the jet axis was calculated including the momentum of the track .",
    "monte carlo simulated events were generated using jetset 7.4 @xcite with parameters tuned by opal @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation functions of peterson et al .",
    "@xcite were used to describe the fragmentation of b and c quarks .",
    "the generated events were passed through a program that simulated the response of the opal detector @xcite and through the same reconstruction algorithms as the data .",
    "two methods were used to tag  events , based on displaced secondary vertices and high momentum leptons .",
    "the first method exploits the long lifetime , hard fragmentation , high decay multiplicity and high mass of b hadrons .",
    "an attempt was made to reconstruct a significantly separated secondary vertex in each jet of the event .",
    "if a secondary vertex was found , an artificial neural network was used to further separate b decays from charm and light quark background .",
    "the neural network has five inputs , derived from decay length , vertex multiplicity and invariant mass information .",
    "the algorithm is described fully in @xcite . for this analysis ,",
    "a hemisphere was defined to be tagged if any jet in the hemisphere had a secondary vertex with tag variable @xmath71 @xcite , giving a hemisphere tagging efficiency of 32% in  events , and a non - b impurity of 12% .",
    "electrons and muons with momentum @xmath72 and transverse momentum @xmath73 were also used to tag  events is employed in this paper . ] .",
    "electrons were identified in the polar angle region @xmath74 using a re - optimised version of the neural network algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the identification relies on ionisation energy loss ( @xmath75 ) measured in the tracking chamber , spatial and energy - momentum ( @xmath76 ) matching between tracking and calorimetry , and the multiplicity measured in the presampler detectors .",
    "photon conversions were rejected using another neural network algorithm @xcite .",
    "muons were identified in the polar angle region @xmath74 by requiring a spatial match between a track reconstructed in the tracking detectors and a track segment reconstructed in the external muon chambers , as in @xcite .",
    "the tagged lepton hemispheres were further enhanced in semileptonic b decays by using information from the lepton @xmath77 and @xmath69 , and its degree of isolation from the rest of the jet , in a neural network algorithm @xcite .",
    "this suppresses contributions from cascade ( @xmath78 ) decays ( which have the wrong correlation of lepton sign with b hadron production flavour ) , charm and fake lepton background .",
    "the output @xmath79 of the network was required to be greater than 0.7 , giving a lepton sample about 75% pure in @xmath80 decays .",
    "the lepton tags contribute an additional 5% to the hemisphere b - tagging efficiency , bringing the total to about 37% with an impurity of 13% in monte carlo .",
    "the events used for the final analysis are those tagged by either of the b tagging methods described above ( referred to as the t - tag ) in one hemisphere , and passing the measurement selection requirements in the other hemisphere .",
    "these latter requirements are described below in section  [ ss : lfvtx ] for the b hadron lifetime analysis and section  [ ss : cpvtx ] for the cp(t ) analysis , and are referred to as the m - tag .",
    "both hemispheres are used as measurement hemispheres in events tagged by both tags in both hemispheres .",
    "the  purity of the combined tag t - m samples ( tagged by the t - tag in one hemisphere and the m - tag in the other ) were determined by applying an extension of the double tagging technique used for measuring  @xcite .",
    "the number of hemispheres @xmath81 tagged by tag @xmath82 ( @xmath82=t or m ) , and the number of events @xmath83 tagged by tag @xmath82 in one hemisphere and tag @xmath84 in the other hemisphere , are related to the total number  of events passing the event selection by : @xmath85 here @xmath86 gives the efficiency of tag @xmath82 to tag hemispheres of flavour q ( q = uds , c or b ) .",
    "the correlations @xmath87 are defined by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the efficiency to tag a event simultaneously with tag @xmath82 in one hemisphere and tag @xmath84 in the other .",
    "deviations of @xmath87 from unity account for the fact that the tagging in the two hemispheres is not completely independent , there being small efficiency correlations for both physical and instrumental reasons .",
    "the quantities  and  are the fractions of hadronic  decays to  and , and were taken to be @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the values of  and  ( which are known to be well modelled in monte carlo @xcite ) together with all the correlation terms @xmath87 , were determined from the monte carlo , and the values of , @xmath81 and @xmath83 measured from the data .",
    "the five equations  [ e : ntmult ] were then solved using a @xmath92 minimisation procedure to give the b - tagging efficiency  of the t - tag , and all the tagging efficiencies ,  and  of the m - tag . the b - purity  of the combined tag t - m sample",
    "was then calculated as : @xmath93 the results of this procedure are given in table  [ t : purity ] for the three data samples : 199395 data with the m - tag used to measure the b hadron lifetime , and 199395 and 1991 - 92 data with the m - tag used in the cp(t ) analysis . in the last case , the t - tag used vertexing in the @xmath61-@xmath62 plane only @xcite , and the purity is correspondingly lower .",
    "the purity is somewhat higher for the b lifetime analysis , as the requirements on the m - tag secondary vertex also provide some rejection of non - b background . in contrast , the cp(t ) m - tag has almost equal efficiency for all flavours .",
    ".[t : purity ] the numbers of hadronic events , selected combined tag t - m events and tag purities for each of the data samples .",
    "the breakdown of statistical and systematic errors for each of the purity values is also given .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     the total systematic error on  is @xmath94 , and is dominated by the uncertainty on the flavour mis - tag rates .",
    "additionally , it was checked that the fit was stable with respect to variations of the minimum and maximum time cuts .",
    "the fit was tested on monte carlo by reweighting so as to introduce variations between the b and  hadron lifetimes , and checking that the fit recovered the correct values of .",
    "the errors were checked by splitting the monte carlo into subsamples , as before .",
    "the lifetimes of the  and  mesons , and their ratio , have been measured using a technique based on reconstructed secondary vertices . from a sample of 2390221",
    "hadronic  decays collected by the opal detector between 1993 and 1995 , the results @xmath95 were obtained , where in each case the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "these results are in agreement with other measurements from lep , sld and cdf @xcite , and with the world average values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the result for the  lifetime is the most precise determination to date .    using a similar technique , an inclusive sample of b hadron decays has been used to search for cp and cpt violation effects .",
    "no such effects have been seen . from the time dependent asymmetry of inclusive decays ,",
    "the cp violation parameter has been determined to be @xmath98 this result agrees with the opal measurement using semileptonic b decays : @xmath99 @xcite , and is also in agreement with other less precise results from cleo and cdf @xcite .    the fractional difference in the lifetimes of b and   hadrons has also been measured to be @xmath100 this is the first published analysis to test the equality of the b and  hadron lifetimes .",
