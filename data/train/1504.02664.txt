    "* henceforth g12 ) though these are limited in sample size .",
    "the dust masses estimated using canonical single or two - temperature component fits to the spectral energy distributions in the fir/-submm imply dust masses which are uncomfortably close to ( or indeed exceed ) the amount of metals predicted to be ejected in these supernovae ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * g12 ) .",
    "the inferred dust mass depends on the assumed dust properties , which can thus change whether snrs appears to contain unrealistically large amounts of dust or not .",
    "if the grains are silicates , the grain masses are high relative to the emissivity . for carbonaceous dust",
    "the mass / emissivity - ratio is much smaller , which is also the case for ice - coated grains and various other types of coagulates .",
    "variation in dust temperatures , grain sizes and material properties makes dust - mass estimates from seds uncertain , which is recognised in the literature .",
    "the fact that seds arising from dust emission often suggest there is a range of grain temperatures in a dust population , has inspired several publications on how to solve the inverse problem of finding the corresponding grain - temperature distribution ( gtd ) from an observed sed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "solving this inverse problem would thus provide empirical constraints on the functional form of the gtd that can be used to improve dust estimates . in principle , there is a detailed correspondence between the dust sed and the gtd , but finding the exact shape of the latter is unfortunately often a badly conditioned problem @xcite .",
    "common practice is still to fit one or two single - temperature components to model the sed , which may affect the implied dust mass ; in particular , the mass of cold dust ( @xmath8k ) may be overestimated by pushing too much flux into this component .",
    "it has recently been suggested by , e.g. , g12 , @xcite and ( * ? ? ? *",
    "henceforth td13 ) that the treatment of grain temperatures may be important in the case of the crab nebula .",
    "initially g12 used a two - temperature fit to the observed sed to derive dust masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for silicates and carbon within the crab respectively . in parallel with our work ,",
    "td13 have made a model of the fir dust emission in the crab nebula explicitly taking the synchrotron radiation field and grain - sizes into account in calculating the radiation balance .",
    "they claim that the required dust mass to explain the sed is significantly reduced in their model but this is due to a combination of the model as such and the use of a different set of optical constants ( for which laboratory measurements are only available at @xmath11 m ) .",
    "we note , also , that detailed modelling can give very different results compared to td13 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worth elaborating on the effect of considering a cold - dust gtd and in particular , to consider how sensitive the dust masses obtained from sed fitting are to the assumed dust temperatures .",
    "we use a simple , computationally inexpensive , ` model ' based on known constraints on the gtd , which can be applied in any environment regardless of whether the radiation field heating the dust can be specified or not .",
    "@xcite , have successfully modelled the gtd of star forming galaxies using a power - law in a similar manner .",
    "attempts to solve the inverse problem mentioned above for molecular clouds have suggested the gtd may be closer to an exponential form , however ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is not to provide a precise and realistic model of dust emission , though .",
    "we merely aim to investigate how much of a difference introducing a range of grain temperatures makes in general , compared to other uncertainties in deriving the dust mass .",
    "in this section we will just briefly summarise the physics underlying the conventional way of inferring dust masses and grain temperatures from fir / sub - mm fluxes from a source is the energy output ( luminosity ) per unit surface area , e.g. in units of w  m@xmath12 .",
    "specific _ or _",
    "monochromatic _ flux is per wavelength ( or frequency ) @xmath13 is the same as ` spectral flux density ' commonly used in observational work ( usually with the unit being jy  @xmath14  w  m@xmath12  hz@xmath15 ) .",
    "however , to keep the terminology simple we only use the term ` flux ' , and ask the reader to bear in mind that a subscript @xmath16 means the flux at a specific wave length . ] .      it is normally assumed that dust grains absorb and emit photons according to kirchhoff s law and that the source function can be described by a planck function @xmath17 and that optically thin conditions apply in the fir / sub - mm of the surrounding medium . if @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the ratio of the effective and geometric cross sections ( kirchhoff s law ) and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gas density , @xmath22 is the opacity due to absorption and @xmath23 is the geometric thickness of the surrounding medium ( optically thin conditions ) , then the observed fir / sub - mm flux is the sum of all reemitted flux from dust grains , where the flux from a grain of radius @xmath24 and temperature @xmath25 is @xmath26 in the equation above , @xmath27 is the distance to the observer and @xmath28 is the grain - size distribution ( gsd ) by number normalised per unit volume . with the additional assumption that an ensemble of dust grains can be described with a single grain temperature @xmath25 and that @xmath29 ( the rayleigh limit ) , the flux from this ensemble can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 in the rayleigh limit and @xmath32 is the total volume taken up by the dust .",
    "multiplying both sides of the above equation with the bulk density of the grains @xmath33 , one obtains the relation @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a quantity to be referred to as ` emissivity ' ( or ` absorptivity ' , depending on the context ) which has the same dimension as opacity , but reflects the optical properties of the grain material and should not be confused with the opacity of the surrounding medium @xmath22 referred to above .",
    "( [ dustmass ] ) conveniently evades the essentially unknown gsd .",
    "however , it is not obvious that the assumptions made to derive this simple relation between dust flux and mass are valid in general . in particular , it is only valid in the rayleigh limit and if all dust grains have the same temperatures , where the latter implies that they should all have the same size as well .",
    "the rayleigh limit only applies to emission at long wavelengths ( absorption and scattering is mainly in the optical / uv ) , which may cause an implicit dependence on grain size with different grain temperatures as the result . in any realistic dust model one",
    "has to integrate over a suitable size distribution and make use of a variety of dust compositions / materials .",
    "that is , the dust mass corresponding to a given sed depends on the gtd @xmath36 . the flux from dust for such a distribution",
    "is given by @xmath37 we will in the following elaborate on how much of an effect @xmath38 has on the dust masses derived from fir/-sub - mm seds .",
    "the basic assumption underlying the relation between dust flux and dust mass is that it is the same dust grains that absorb light in the uv / optical or gain energy due to collisions with other particles ( usually electrons ) that are also emitting radiation in the ir / fir / sub - mm .",
    "the physical underpinnings for radiative and collisional heating are different , however , but the equilibrium temperature distributions for the grains may not be that different .",
    "radiative heating is normally due to absorption of radiation in the uv / optical and assuming the grains are in local thermal equilibrium with the mean intensity of the radiation field we can equate the absorbed and emitted power , i.e. @xmath39 . the optical depth of the surrounding medium may in principle affect the energy absorption but has little effect on the re - emission at long wavelengths .",
    "thus , making use of @xmath40 ( as previously defined ) in the rayleigh limit and assuming the surrounding medium is optically thin , we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean intensity of the radiation field .",
    "note that @xmath40 ( the rayleigh - limit approximation ) can only be used on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ebalance1 ] ) , which represents emission at long wavelengths , and that eq .",
    "( [ ebalance1 ] ) is strictly valid only locally ( but can be generalised , resulting in an effective overall gtd ) .",
    "conveniently , the emission at long wavelengths is approximately a power - law in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , replacing @xmath40 with @xmath43 , integrating over wavelength and assuming that heating occurs in the grey - absorption limit ( or large - particle limit ) where @xmath44 is constant , we have then a simple power - law of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are scaling parameters .",
    "note that even if one adopts an explicitly grain - size dependent @xmath44 , the grain temperature is still ( locally ) uniquely determined by the grain size under thermal equilibrium conditions .",
    "for further details on the above , see appendix [ hecoeq ] .",
    "the gtd @xmath38 can be determined from @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the gsd in terms of mass . for a canonical mrn distribution @xcite @xmath50 .",
    "thus , adopting an mrn distribution and the grey - absorption limit , the gtd is simply also a power - law @xmath51 .",
    "such a gtd has been recovered for hot dust ( heated by short - wavelength radiation ) around active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the grey - absorption limit may not be strictly applicable in other cases ( e.g. , snrs ) and the slope of the temperature distribution is therefore likely steeper than in eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw2 ] ) and may deviate from the simple power - law form above , i.e. , the scale temperature @xmath46 would in this case be a function of @xmath24 .",
    "we note also that collisional heating should give rise to a gtd in a way similar to radiative heating ( see appendix [ collheat ] ) .",
    "previous work has shown how the gtd is affected for small grains undergoing significant temperature fluctuations ( non - equilibrium conditions ) as a result of being hit by energetic photons or other particles ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the heat capacity determines how much energy the dust particle can hold , i.e. , the energy in an absorbed photon will partly heat up the material and the remainder will be emitted at longer wavelengths .",
    "the amount of energy a grain can hold is proportional to its mass , which is why small grains do not easily obtain an equilibrium temperature if heated with short - wavelength radiation . for radiative heating",
    ", we have that an energy increment @xmath52 is causing a temperature increment according to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the heat capacity at a constant volume . the heat capacity for a spherical grain is , in the low - temperature limit of debye s model ( @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the debye temperature ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of monomers in the grain , @xmath59 their mass @xcite .",
    "the temperature increase is effectively @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the energy of the photon and @xmath44 is the ratio of the effective and geometrical cross sections of the grain .",
    "inserting suitable numbers shows that a single uv photon could suffice to raise the temperature of a cold ( @xmath62k ) nano - sized grain almost an order of magnitude .",
    "very small grains will usually also cool rapidly and regain their initial temperatures of @xmath62k in typically a couple of hours or less @xcite .",
    "thus , at any given time , a population of cold , very small grains may therefore have wide range of temperatures , leading to a gtd even for a population of grains with exactly the same sizes .    at first glance",
    "it may seem like the above factors complicate the picture a lot .",
    "but , fortunately , the effect on the estimated mass of cold dust is negligible .",
    "first , most of the mass is expected to be in the large grains ( cf . the mrn size distribution in terms of dust mass , @xmath63 ) and dust in sne appears to have a strong bias towards large grains in general according to recent results @xcite",
    ". not more than a few percent of the mass can be in grains small enough to undergo significant temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "( [ debye ] ) we can also see that size can easily compensate for the fact that the grains are cold .",
    "second , if temperature fluctuates are important , they will cause emission in the infrared and near infrared bands @xcite .",
    "cold dust radiates almost exclusively in the fir / sbmm bands .",
    "thus , in conclusion , we do not have to worry greatly about temperature fluctuations as long as we are dealing with cold dust and a steep gtd .",
    "under most circumstances it is inevitable that there is a distribution of dust temperatures rather than distinct representative dust temperatures for specific dust components ( e.g. , a cold , warm and hot component ) as we have touched upon above . this fact has previously been pointed out as a caveat ( see , e.g. , g12 , td13 and * ? ? ? * in the case of the crab nebula ) .",
    "such a distribution must be very steep and narrow not to create seds which are inconsistent with the featureless ` bumps ' associated with cold dust , but it can still have a significant effect on the derived dust mass . in this section",
    "we describe a simple multi - temperature model for the fir / sub - mm dust emission .",
    "we use the crab nebula as a test case , to show that an observed sed can be reproduced with very different dust masses , and then continue with a more general analysis of how multi - temperature sed fits may differ from two - temperature fits , by generating a large mock sample of seds from simple gtds .",
    "there are essentially just two ways to incorporate the effect of a range of grain temperatures when modelling an sed : either one has to ( computationally ) find the gtd from an assumed gsd and a ( possibly ) known radiation field , or , one could make a direct assumption or estimate of the gtd ( or its functional form , more precisely ) .",
    "td13 preferred the first approach , while we will here explore the latter .",
    "there is no actual advantage of any of these two approaches over the other in terms of their physical correctness ( we simply have too little information to distinguish between the two ) , though it is clear that an assumption directly regarding the gtd is much simpler to deal with .",
    "there is also a direct link between the observed sed and the corresponding gtd that could ( in theory ) be used to constrain the functional form @xcite . in principle",
    "one could thus construct a fairly consistent model even without any knowledge about the heating radiation field .",
    "one could of course argue that the best option would be to use a gsd that results from theoretical modelling of sn dust formation and then chose an approach similar to that used by td13 .",
    "but unfortunately the models do not offer a consistent picture .",
    "@xcite suggest the gsd produced by sne may be somewhat flatter [ @xmath64 , except for very large grains , where the mrn distribution seems to be recovered .",
    "but the effective gsd may be even flatter still , if small grains are destroyed @xcite , and the upper and lower size limits do not correspond to sharp cut - offs , so the assumption of a power - law gsd made by td13 is not obviously the optimal ansatz .",
    "modelling of the dust contribution to the sed is often done by fitting one or two components ( cold and warm dust ) , with weighting factors that specify the mass contribution from each component .",
    "we generalise this to @xmath58 components , but with the weighting factors constrained by a gtd assumed to follow a power law or exponential as motivated above .",
    "thus , we maintain the same number of parameters ( four ) when fitting the sed , while at the same time dust grains can have an arbitrary range of temperatures .",
    "regarding the functional form of the gtd @xmath38 , the energy balance ( eq . [ ebalance1 ] ) suggest that if a grain has a temperature @xmath65 and another grain has a temperature @xmath66 , then grains with temperature @xmath67 can not be larger than grains with temperature @xmath65 ( see also the appendix [ hecoeq ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath68 for all @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath44 , at any given wavelength , normally is a smooth function of @xmath24 without very prominent features , there is no reason to expect that @xmath38 is a complicated function of @xmath25 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the gtd is a smooth , monotonously decreasing function of grain temperature .",
    "steep power - laws have previously been considered in other contexts @xcite .      as discussed previously , radiative heating that occurs in the grey - absorption limit corresponds to a power - law gtd @xmath38 where the gsd is a power - law . if the dust is heated by short - wavelength radiation ( uv , x - ray etc . )",
    "this is in fact a good approximation of reality .",
    "we have therefore as good reasons to try a power - law form as our ansatz for the effective gtd as there are reasons to expect a power - law gsd .    with @xmath69 , where we set @xmath70",
    ", we can model the flux from an ensemble of dust grains with different sizes and temperature using a function @xmath71 in which @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the high and low temperature cut - off , respectively .",
    "@xmath75 is a constant such that @xmath76 represents the blackbody flux from all @xmath58 components .",
    "this function replaces the planck functions and the weighting coefficients in , e.g. , a two - component model and the exponent @xmath5 can be treated as a free parameter . if @xmath58 is large ( we assume @xmath77 in subsequent applications ) , the fitting result corresponds to a continuous gtd @xmath38 as in eq .",
    "( [ dustmass2 ] ) .",
    "the power - law form of @xmath38 is strictly valid only under very special circumstances , as we have pointed out in section [ radheat ] .",
    "it is more realistic that the slope of the gtd changes with the grain temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the gtds derived by @xcite from the seds of cold molecular clouds are very close to exponential for @xmath78k and detailed computer simulations of molecular clouds do in fact suggest this may be a realistic functional form of the gtd of a single dust species @xcite . if an exponential form of @xmath38 works well for molecular clouds it seems reasonable it could work as well for cold dust in snrs .",
    "thus , we try also an exponential model . using an exponential gtd , @xmath79",
    ", we have in analogy with the power law case , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a free scaling parameter .",
    "since a gtd must be steep , a realistic value of @xmath81 is only a few k.    power - law models used on very cold dust suggest the gtd is flattening out at low dust temperatures @xcite , which further motivates that we should consider a gtd of the exponential form above ( see fig .",
    "[ graintemp ] for an example of how this flattening naturally occurs at low @xmath25 for an exponential gtd ) .",
    "obviously , there has to be a lowest and a highest possible grain temperature , because grains are neither arbitrarily small , nor arbitrarily large ( see appendix [ hecoeq ] ) .",
    "we use these cuts on the temperature distribution as fitting parameters as well ( see eq .",
    "[ fitfunc ] ) , which corresponds to the integration limits above .",
    "initial values for @xmath74 and @xmath73 may be determined by a two - temperature fit , which stabilises the fitting procedure .",
    "one may argue that the lower limit @xmath74 may also be fixed to this value , since the lowest possible dust temperature is essentially defined by the shape of the fir/-sub - mm tail of the sed ( see fig . 4 in g12 ) .",
    "but this is not necessarily a good approach , since the flux contribution from very cold ( and large ) grains may be small , while their contribution to the dust mass is significant .",
    "note , also , that this is related to the upper grain - size limit as well ( the coldest grains are the largest ones ) , while the upper temperature limit , and thus also the lower grain - size limit , is harder to constrain ( we will return to this later ) .",
    "td13 assume an upper grain - size limit which , according to their model , corresponds to approximately the temperature of the cold component in a two - temperature fit . therefore , in our ` test application ' to the crab nebula below",
    ", we have included a case where @xmath74 is fixed to the temperature of the cold component in the two - temperature fit , in order to compare with the results of td13 .",

    "the integrated fluxes need also to be corrected for line emission . in some cases it is small , e.g. , only 8.7% of the total flux at @xmath102 m and 4.9% of the @xmath103 m ( see table 2 in g12 ) .",
    "but the @xmath104 m flux due to dust emission is 43% of the synchrotron subtracted flux @xcite , which is important to take into account .    since g12 obtained a valid fit with a canonical two - temperature fit with astronomical silicates @xcite and amorphous carbon @xcite , we first modelled the sed using astronomical silicates but now with the two forms of gtds described in section [ multitemp ] .",

    "[ graintemp ] ) .",
    "since the low - temperature limit @xmath74 is decisive for the inferred mass , we have considered two cases : ( 1 ) a lower limit on the dust temperature set to the cold dust component temperature derived in g12 ( again , see table [ parameters ] ) and ( 2 ) a lower limit which is treated as free parameter , albeit with an absolute lower limit set by the cosmic background temperature @xmath105  k. we will later discuss the effects of assumptions about @xmath74 in more detail ( section 3.4 ) .",

    ", the fitting algorithm pushes @xmath74 to the minimum value @xmath106  k. maximising the amount of very cold grains like this suggests dust masses which are a factor 4 - 6 higher than those obtained in the two - temperature fits . obviously , this last result is not very realistic , but it clearly demonstrates why fitting simple sed models to data can be dangerous .",

    "a @xmath114 star in such case allows @xmath117 of silicates ( assuming an effective mass number @xmath118 ) and @xmath119 carbon dust to be formed .",
    "thus , while the dust masses found by g12 are not obviously overestimates , a model suggesting close to 100% dust - condensation efficiency is not very convincing since one expects a non - negligible sublimation rate in a snr .",
    "the lower dust masses may seem like a reasonable and conservative choice , but one has to be aware that the total sed can not provide conclusive evidence .",
    "the range of dust temperatures is directly connected to the width of fir / sub - mm ( dust ) bump in the sed .",
    "` warmer ' grains ( with temperatures above the coldest grains , that is ) will inevitably add flux on the short - wavelength side of the dust sed .",
    "what this extra flux will look like in the sed depends on the dust type , though .",
    "astronomical silicates can provide a tell - tale signature  the @xmath120 m feature  that reveals the presence of warm dust ( @xmath121k ) , while the carbon - dust fir / sub - mm sed is mostly featureless .",
    "the @xmath120 m feature can not arise from cold dust , however .",
    "but the location of the peak wavelength and slope of the short - wavelength tail poses a constraint on the cold - dust gtd regardless of the presence of any dust - emission features .",
    "the kurtosis ( ` peakedness ' ) of the dust sed can also be affected by the gtd .",
    "in particular , using a continuous gtd may result in more flux in the middle of the sed than in the case of a two - temperature model .",
    "this is clearly seen in the fits to the crab nebula with a fixed low - temperature limit ( see section [ testapp ] , figs .",
    "[ crabneb ] and [ crabneb2 ] ) .",
    "thus , a continuous gtd may differ slightly from the two - temperature model in terms of the shape of the resultant sed .",
    "this affects the required dust mass of the model because the fit to the observed sed will be different .",

    "as we have pointed out above , it seems reasonable to associate the low temperature cut - off @xmath74 with the temperature of the cold component @xmath126 from the two - temperature fit ( although this is not obviously the case , which we will discuss later ) .",
    "hence , if we compare @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we would have an approximate measure of how much the gtd affects the implied dust mass for a given set of parameters , if the cold - dust temperature is equal to the lower temperature limit @xmath74 of the gtd .",
    "since we are considering thermal radiation at long wavelengths , we may also approximate the planck function using the fact that @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "it is then straight forward to show that , for @xmath79 , @xmath131 ( very steep gtd ) we have at large wavelengths @xmath132 which is because the effect of a wide range of dust temperatures is in such case limited and depends on the balance between cold and warm dust .",
    "that is , the effect of a realistic gtd ( which must be steep ) on the implied dust mass depends mostly on the temperature of the coldest dust . moreover , using eq .",
    "( [ sbratio2 ] ) and since @xmath74 is typically a few times @xmath81 ( if the temperature @xmath74 is that of the two - temperature fit ) , one can easily verify that the increase in flux from a gtd compared to the two - temperature fit is not likely more than @xmath133% .",
    "we have also computed eq .",
    "( [ slambda ] ) by numerical integration using an exponential as well as an power - law gtd with @xmath44 for ` astronomical silicates ' @xcite and amorphous carbon @xcite . because this integration is computationally fairly inexpensive",
    ", we generated a large , dense grid of artificial seds with either a fixed lower temperature limit or a fixed upper temperature limit and a range of values for the remaining parameters ( see table [ grid ] ) .",
    "for each sed we then fitted two - temperature models with the temperature of the cold component fixed to @xmath134 and with @xmath126 as a free parameter .",

    "as can be seen on figs .",
    "[ massratio1 ] and [ massratio2 ] , the @xmath135-ratios suggests the introduction of a gtd ( with @xmath137 ) only lowers the implied dust mass by @xmath138% for realistic values of @xmath74 , @xmath73 and @xmath81 in case of an exponential gtd ( left panels in fig .",
    "[ massratio1 ] and [ massratio2 ] ) and a similar result is obtained for the power - law case ( right panels in fig .",
    "[ massratio1 ] and [ massratio2 ] ) . comparing the figures , it is also clear that the lower temperature limit @xmath74 is more important than the upper limit @xmath74 for any reasonable gtd ( which must have @xmath131 or @xmath139 ) , as we predicted from eq .",
    "( [ sbratio2 ] ) above .",
    "the @xmath140% ( or @xmath141% ) reduction of the ( silicate or carbon ) dust mass that we obtained by including a gtd in the sed modelling of the crab nebula is in fact due to two factors that make comparable contributions : the increased flux due to the addition of a range of grain temperatures ( higher average @xmath25 ) and a mere difference in the fit due to the slightly different shape of the model sed .",
    "the latter can be seen in figs .",
    "[ crabneb ] and [ crabneb2 ] , as well as fig . 5 in td13 .",
    "the combined effect amounts to a _ factor of two _ for silicates in the crab nebula , which is likely the largest reduction one can expect in employing a gtd in general ( not only for the crab nebula ) .",
    "this is expected since in case of an exact fit to the sed , the relative mass reduction would be the same as the relative flux increase from adding more warmer dust ( typically @xmath133% ) . as is evident from figure [ massratio1 ] and [ massratio2 ] , the expected dust - mass ratio , comparing a two - temperature fit with a gtd - model fit , would only in extreme cases ( e.g. , very cold dust ) reach above two .",
    "it is worth stressing that the mass reduction we describe above is _ totally dependent _ on the assumption that the temperature of the cold - dust component in a two - temperature fit is the same as the lower temperature limit of the gtd ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this assumption is similar to assuming an upper - limit grain size , as in td13 , and has essentially the same effect : it limits the amount of dust mass .",
    "however , we performed further numerical experiments which showed that if one allows the gtd to reach down to very low dust temperatures , a two - temperature fit to that gtd may actually predict the same or even a _ higher _ dust mass , compared to the two - temperature fit by g12 .",
    "the effect of the extra flux from warmer dust on the predicted dust mass may , in reality , be counteracted by the presence of dust colder than the cold component of a two - temperature fit .",
    "such cold grains may affect the dust mass without making a significant contribution to the sed , thus still yielding a good model fit .    in figs .",
    "[ massratio3 ] and [ massratio4 ] we show the implied dust masses from a two - temperature fit to a grid of seds generated from simple gtds compared to the ` true ' dust masses corresponding to the adopted gtds as in figs .

    "the dust masses inferred from the two - temperature fits are typically @xmath142% lower than the ` true ' dust masses .",
    "the cold component temperature is typically @xmath143k higher than the low - temperature cut - off in the gtd , although there is no general scaling relation ( see the contours in figs .",

    "@xmath145k represents a special case : for an exponential gtd the two - temperature dust mass has a local minimum , and for a power - law gtd there is local maximum in this @xmath74 interval .",
    "this special low - temperature range depends somewhat on the choice of @xmath73 and for narrow gtds such a temperature range may not exist .",
    "but it coincides with the range of dust temperatures that is the most interesting for cold dust in supernovae",
    ". it seems , therefore , that the effect on the inferred dust mass depends on the form of the gtd , which indicate that detailed radiative transfer models may be the best option as it will provide the best possible information about the gtd .",
    "overall , our numerical experiments presented here , suggest that a two - temperature fit may not be as bad as it may seem at first , judging from the results of td13 as well as our results presented in figs .",
    "[ crabneb ] and [ crabneb2 ] , but simple sed fits are still not reliable .      in an equilibrium model , there is a direct relation between grain size and grain temperature for a given ( invariant ) radiation field , which should be evident from section [ radheat ] ( but see also appendix [ hecoeq ] ) . in a simple model , like the one we have used here",
    ", it is not meaningful to discuss grain sizes in quantitative terms based on the steepness of the gtd and temperature cuts as obtained from sed fitting .",
    "the reason is that eq .",
    "( [ ebalance1 ] ) is a local relation and adopted gtd is a global approximation .",
    "but locally the grain size must uniquely determine the grain temperature as long as nothing breaks the equilibrium .",
    "the steepness of the gtd is also directly dependent of @xmath146 , i.e. , the temperature - size relation is fundamental to the connection between the dust mass and the dust sed ( see eq .",
    "[ powerlaw2 ] and appendix [ hecoeq ] ) .",
    "but one should also remember that there is a degeneracy between the upper size limit of the grains and the slope of the gsd , which can become problematic even in models with detailed radiative transfer ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the upper temperature limit ( corresponding to lower size limit ) may have bearing on the implied dust mass obtained from the sed ( see figs .",
    "[ massratio2 ] and [ massratio4 ] ) since the small grains usually only make up a small fraction of the dust mass , but still contribute significantly to the sed since they are slightly warmer than the large grains ( the flux from a grain is essentially proportional to the temperature ) .",
    "td13 , on the other hand , argue that the choice of @xmath147 has no particular effect on their results for the crab nebula ( according to their monte carlo simulation ) which is a result we can only reproduce when @xmath74 is fixed and the gtd has a certain slope .",
    "possibly , this is related to the fact that their model yields @xmath148 for small grain radii @xmath24 , though it is unclear why @xmath25 becomes size independent for small grains in their model , which is also an equilibrium model .",
    "since there is known to be a distribution of dust - grain sizes , there must also be a distribution of grain temperatures ( gtd )  even in case of thermal equilibrium , which should apply to cold dust .",
    "we illustrated how this can increase the emission from any type of dust component , whether it is silicates , carbonaceous dust or another composition .",
    "we applied a gtd model to the sed of the crab nebula , which can be explained using thermal emission from solid dust grains at a range of dust temperatures ( rather than the canonical two - temperature component model ) .",
    "a range of dust temperatures lower the required dust mass by @xmath050% and 30 - 40% for astronomical silicates and amorphous carbon grains compared to recently published values ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively ) , but the implied dust mass can also increase by as much as almost a factor of six ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) depending on assumptions regarding the sizes / temperatures of the coldest grains . in general , we find / confirm that :    1 .",
    "the width of the sed determines how much small warm grains can contribute to the fir / sub - mm flux excess . only snrs with relatively wide seds may show gtd effects worth considering .",
    "+ 2 .   introducing a gtd",
    "has a significant but limited effect on the derived dust mass compared to a two - temperature fit . with the lower temperature limit of the gtd set equal to temperature of the cold component of the two - temperature fit",
    ", the implied dust mass is typically @xmath140% larger for the two - temperature fit .",
    "but without this coupling there is not necessarily any dust - mass reduction resulting from the introduction of a gtd ( the inferred dust mass may in fact _ increase _ ) .",
    "the difference in shape of the sed ( e.g. , its ` peakedness ' ) for a two - temperature model compered to a gtd model , in combination with the flux uncertainties , lead to different fitting results , which may affect the implied dust mass as much as the extra flux from warmer grains added due to the gtd .",
    "we have therefore shown that introducing a gtd may predict a different dust mass than a canonical two - component model .",
    "but we also demonstrate that the effect is limited : we have shown that this depends strongly on the temperature of the coldest dust and how well - constrained the observed sed is in the fir / sub - mm .",
    "it is not appropriate to claim that introducing a gtd ( or a grain - heating model as in td13 ) gives us better constraints on the dust mass of a snr , such as the crab nebula .",
    "first , we can not know whether there should be a low - temperature limit in the gtd with a value similar to the temperature of the cold component in a two - temperature fit , even if this seems a reasonable assumption .",
    "the dust mass is uncertain by at most a factor of a few due to this .",
    "second , the distances to many galactic snrs are relatively uncertain .",
    "the crab nebula is no exception : g12 adopt @xmath151  kpc , which is exactly in the middle of the range @xmath152  kpc given by @xcite . assuming @xmath153  kpc the uncertainty of the dust mass is almost a factor of three .",
    "third , uncertainties in the optical and structural properties of the dust component amounts to at least a factor of a few : the emissivity of dust may vary considerably according to some observational estimates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and if volatiles ( e.g. ice mantles , which we will discuss in a forthcoming paper ) makes up a significant part of the dust , there may be an additional factor of two in the uncertainty . combining all of the above , the total ( maximum ) uncertainty range spans at least an order of magnitude , somewhat depending on available constraints .",
    "a major point is that while the present gtd approach is not more accurate than the two - temperature approach , it demonstrates that simple sed fitting can not really constrain the dust mass .",
    "one may then ask whether the gtd is ultimately an improvement . here",
    "we would argue that incorporating a more physical model for dust heating and fir / sub - mm emission from dust grains is indeed always a qualitative improvement , but the most concerning uncertainty in the model  what the dust is actually made of  still remains .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that the gtd does not always reduce the dust mass derived from seds ( as implied by td13 ) , but also that the gtd - related uncertainty is typically not a dominant source of uncertainty i.e. the effect of grain temperatures is usually a part of the total uncertainty in deriving dust masses from the sed .",
    "the degree of dust condensation ( the fraction of condensible material that end up in dust grains ) is unlikely close to 100% , but the uncertainties in the conversion from fir / sub - mm flux to dust mass and the amount of metals available for dust formation prevent precise estimates . in conclusion ,",
    "the efficiency of dust production in supernovae remains poorly constrained , even if we would construct a sophisticated model of dust emission .",
    "this does of course not mean that radiative transfer models based on dust - grain populations with a range of grain sizes and temperatures are not important ( and needed ) tools for converting infrared to submm seds to dust masses .",
    "we conclude that one should avoid using simple sed fits as far as possible whenever there is evidence of a range of grain temperatures .",
    "but the overall error in the amount of dust formed in supernova is still largely due to the uncertainties in dust composition , structure and behaviour of optical constants and thus determining the mass of dust remains extremely difficult .",

    "( [ powerlaw2_a ] ) tells us that we must have @xmath179 as @xmath180 .",
    "that is , absence of a temperature - size relation is not compatible with a the existence of grains having a range of sizes and temperatures , unless both heating and cooling take place at long - wavelengths , in which case the grain radius @xmath24 is cancelled out in eq .",
    "( [ ebalance ] ) .",
    "[ collheat ] in case heating is due mainly to collisions with ambient gas particles , we may write @xcite @xmath181 where @xmath182 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath183 is the electron mass , @xmath184 the electron density , @xmath185 the electron temperature and @xmath186 is a unitless function describing the efficiency of energy deposition . by definition ,",
    "@xmath187 when the efficiency is maximal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that the heating rate is inversely proportional to the particle mass in the expression above , explains why collisions with electrons should be more important than collisions with any other gas particle , because the electron mass is very small in comparison with , e.g. , the proton mass .",
    "since the cooling rate is the same as in the case of radiative heating , i.e. , cooling is still due to long - wavelength radiation , and adopting once again a power - law approximation for @xmath40 at long wavelengths , we obtain @xmath188 where all quantities are as previously defined . with @xmath189 ( efficient energy deposition ) , we recover a power - law of the same form as in the case of radiative heating .",
    "thus , a power - law temperature distribution is a reasonable first approximation not only in case the dust heating is due to short - wavelength radiation , but also when it is due to efficient collisional heating .",
    "another important aspect of the above is that it is difficult to have a dust population where all grains have very similar temperatures unless they also have very similar sizes , regardless of whether the heating is radiative or collisional ."
