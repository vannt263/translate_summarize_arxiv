    "the information can be seen as a gossip about the target - node or the victim ( see text ) .",
    "note that the clustering coefficient of the victim has a different value , namely @xmath2.,width=302 ]    such kind of questions can be easily addressed by representing the social system , composed by individuals and the interactions among them , as a network , i.e. , as a collection of nodes and links .",
    "while networks have been widely used by physicists to study e.g.  porous media  @xcite or a system of interacting spins  @xcite , they can also be used to study social systems .",
    "social networks have helped to further understand the structure and evolution of social systems , where people and their acquaintances are represented by the nodes and links of the network respectively .",
    "in particular , propagation of information in social systems is easily reproduced in such networks and has been addressed in recent physical literature  @xcite due to its importance in epidemiology  @xcite , where information is related to the contagious of diseases , to understand social influence , beliefs and extremism  @xcite , to understand the evolution of financial markets  @xcite , to study econophysical networks underlying e.g. , electrical supply systems or road webs among airports or cities .",
    "here we put emphasizes on how far the information can spread when particular constraints , of interest for social systems , are taken into account .",
    "the way information spreads over the network depends on its content .",
    "a rumour or an opinion concerning some topic which is not directly connected to the social network structure ( political opinion , etc ) can be of interest to any of the neighbors of a certain node , regardless their topological features .",
    "however , as opposed to rumors , a gossip always targets the details about the behavior or private life of a specific person , i.e. , of a specific node .",
    "this node will be called henceforth the target - node or the victim .",
    "therefore , due to this particular content , it is reasonable to assume as a first approach that the information spreads only over people directly connected to the victim .",
    "a simple model recently introduced  @xcite for such kind of information spreading is described as follows . selecting randomly a victim , the gossip about him or her is created at time @xmath3 by an originator which shares a bond with the victim . at @xmath4",
    "the originator only spreads the gossip to other nodes , which are connected to him-/herself and the victim .",
    "the spread continues until all reachable acquaintances of the victim know it , as illustrated by the squares connected by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a real friendship network  @xcite .",
    "our dynamics is therefore like a burning algorithm  @xcite , starting at the originator but limited to sites that are neighbors of the victim .    to measure how effectively the gossip - or , in general , the information - attains the acquaintances of the victim ,",
    "we define the spreading factor as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total number of people who eventually hear the gossip and @xmath7 is the degree of the the victim . in addition , we also define the spreading time @xmath8 which defines the minimum time it takes to reach this fraction @xmath9 of acquaintances , giving a measure of how far these connected acquaintances are from each other .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath9 and the standard definition of clustering coefficient @xmath10  @xcite are different quantities , since the later only measures the number of bonds between neighbors and contains no information about how such bonds distribute among the victim s acquaintances .",

    "[ sec : first ] by studying how such kind of information spreads in different networks , namely in scale - free and in small - world networks .",

    "there are also situations where the information about the target - node can be of interest beyond the first neighbors , like the case where the victim is a movie star , yielding a scenario similar to the one of usual rumour propagation or even epidemic spreading  @xcite .",

    "the number of nodes and the number of connections are given respectively by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "further , the non - trivial effect of having an optimal degree @xmath15 is also observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b . for these schools",

    "the information is more able to reach a larger fraction of them .",
    "but , contrary to intuition , the same occurs for the nodes having a larger number of friends .",
    "interestingly , information spreads in the same way either through these empirical networks as on scale - free networks , although the corresponding topological and statistical features are known to be quite distinct  @xcite .",
    "for instance , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5]b , the degree distribution @xmath53 of the school networks is typically exponential and not power - law .",
    "since the same optimal degree appears in ba networks , one argues that the existence of this optimal number is not necessarily related to the degree distribution of the network , but rather to the degree correlations .",
    "however , the relation between degree correlations , measured by @xmath52 , and the logarithmic behavior of the spreading time is not straightforward . while in the empirical network we find the same distribution for both @xmath52 and @xmath8 , in ba and apl networks @xmath52 follows a power - law with @xmath7 . in the case of uncorrelated networks , two and three - point correlations reduce to simple expressions of the moments of the degree distribution .",

    "the distribution is well fitted by an exponential .",
    "the reason for the similiarities between empirical networks and ba networks at the particular value @xmath59 may be related to the way the questionnaire was made at the schools : each student should name their friends out of a maximal number of @xmath71 acquaintances . from the similarities we could now argue that in fact on average the students elected @xmath72 acquaintances each .",
    "figure [ fig6]c shows the distribution @xmath64 for a scale - free ba network , while fig .",
    "[ fig6]d shows the same distribution for the empirical networks . before studying such distributions",

    "the spreading factor depends on the number @xmath7 of neighbors and consequently depends also on the network size , since the larger the network the larger the maximal number @xmath73 of neighbors a node may have .",
    "furher , the spread factor varies always between the minimal value @xmath34 and the maximal value @xmath74 and for a given node with @xmath7 neighbors the possible values are @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , if for a specific network all the possible @xmath9-values appear with the same probability one should expect the distribution @xmath64 to be symmetric around @xmath76 with discrete peaks at @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this artificial distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]e , obtained from all possible fractions constructed with all integers from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .    for ba networks",
    ", there is also a symmetry in the vicinity of @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a ) .",

    "[ fig6]d , which is also strongly asymmetric when compared with the corresponding uniform distribution of all possible values of @xmath9 sketched in fig .",
    "the positive skewnesses indicate a higher frequency of low @xmath9-values than of larger ones , which indicates in fact that the neighbors of nodes tend to form small separated sets of linked neighbors . consequently , one is able to address how the connections between neighbors are groupped only by measuring the spreading factor for the central node .",

    "one starts with a regular lattice where each node is attached to @xmath15 neighbors symmetrically displaced .",
    "such regular network is characterized by a clustering coefficient @xmath93 and a shortest path length @xmath94 . in this regular network ,",
    "all links are short - range .",

    "consequently , on average one obtains @xmath111 independently of @xmath7 .",
    "this maximal value for such values of @xmath101 means that the spreading attains all the neighbors of the victim .",
    "therefore one should expect that the time to reach complete spreading should decrease with @xmath112 , which is what one observes in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig7]b .    as a preliminary conclusion of this section one can state that",

    "in this section we will study how @xmath9 and @xmath8 change when the information is able to propagate beyond first neighbors .",
    "for that , we consider two different regimes of information spreading . in the first regime",

    ", there are two other quantities of interest that we introduce here .",
    "one is the total fraction @xmath113 of nodes who know and transmit the information , defined as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the maximal number of nodes in the entire network which already know the information and @xmath25 is the total number of nodes .",

    "moreover the maximal value to which @xmath8 converges for large @xmath7 can be explained as follows : since now the information spreads over first and second neighbors , if the network has poor @xmath7-correlations , for sufficiently large @xmath7 , all values of @xmath7 start to be present within the two first neighborhoods yielding an independence of @xmath8 on @xmath7 .",

    "this occurs independently of @xmath18 . due to the large values of @xmath9 , the distribution @xmath64 has again a very pronounced peak at @xmath30 .    while for these ba networks the results are quite different when the two first neighbors are considered instead of only nearest neighbors , the apollonian network displays an almost invariant behavior .",
    "for an apollonian network almost the same behavior remains .",
    "the lack of sensibility to the increase of the neighborhood in apollonian networks is a consequence of its hierarchical structure . also for small - world and random networks",
    "similar results are obtained .",
    "so , as preliminary conclusions one sees that in hierarchical networks and in networks with small - world property it does not matter if the information can be transmitted beyond the victim s acquaintances or not : in one way or another everyone rapidly knows our secrets !",
    "after seeing what happens in small neighborhoods , the next question refers to the opposite limit , i.e. , when all nodes are able to get the information from the originator .",
    "of course in this case the fraction @xmath9 almost always achieves eventually its maximal value @xmath30 , since the information eventually reaches everybody .",
    "this is a similar situation of what happens with the spread of rumours or epidemics .",
    "though , there is still the case when some neighbor of the victim has no other friends and therefore the information can not spread from or to it .",
    "the main question now is not only to know the minimal time @xmath8 needed for the information to reach the maximal number of nearest neighbors of the victim , but also to compare it with the maximal time @xmath116 needed for the information to achieve the maximal fraction @xmath113 ( see eq .",

    "finally , we examine the case of small - world networks illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig13]a one sees that the spreading time @xmath8 increases almost linearly with the rewiring probability @xmath85 except at the end for large values of @xmath85 ( random network ) .",
    "the maximal spreading time @xmath116 is very large for low rewiring probabilities , due to a large average path length , and decreases one order of magnitude in the range @xmath133 corresponding to small - world networks .",
    "in fact , @xmath116 follows the dependence of the average path length on @xmath85 .    as for the total fraction @xmath113 illustrated in fig .  [ fig13]b",
    "one finds the opposite dependence on @xmath85 than the one found for @xmath116 : for low ( large ) values of @xmath85 one finds low ( large ) values of @xmath113 , and a pronounced increase is observed throughout the entire small - world regime . to explain this behavior one must use both the average path length and the clustering coefficient , @xmath99 and @xmath84 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a . for random networks ( @xmath97 )",
    "the total fraction attains @xmath134 very fast due to the very short average path length . for small values of @xmath85 , although regular networks have an average path length that is larger than in random networks , the spreading time needed to attain @xmath134 is now proportional to @xmath98 . in the small - world regime",
    "however , the average path length is small but the way the neighbors are connected isolates in some few cases nodes from the information spreading process .",
    "so , although small - world networks have large cluster coefficients as in regular networks , the long - range connections change significantly the local topology of a given node - neighborhood .",
    "in all the previous results each friend will surely spread the gossip further .",
    "fortunately people are on average not as nasty as that .",
    "one should expect that only a certain fraction @xmath135 of our friends are not worth to be trusted . in this section",
    "we address this more realistic situation .    since we do not have any sociological information about the topological features of the ` good ' friends we introduce @xmath136 as a probability that a node has to spread the gossip .",
    "for the particular case @xmath137 one reduces to the situations studied previously .",
    "two possible ways of propagation may then occur .",
    "one concerns a scenario where friendships connections are related to contacts between the nodes at a given instant .",
    "in this situation a certain individual tries only once , with probability @xmath136 , to spread the information to its friends . therefore ,",
    "if the gossip is not ` accepted ' once it will never be .",
    "another scenario is of course when the spread is tried repeatedly at each time - step",
    ". we will start with this latter scenario and end with the more pleasant one where gossip is only able to spread from the nodes which heard it most recently .     on a real friendship network of american students",
    "@xcite averaged over 84 schools . in ( a )",
    "we show the spreading time @xmath8 and in ( b ) the spread factor @xmath9 , both as function of degree @xmath7 .",
    "the insets show the same data for the ba network with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . at each time - step",
    "each node which knows the gossip tries to spread it . in all plots one has @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) , @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) , @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) , @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) and @xmath137 ( @xmath148).,width=321 ]    introducing the new parameter @xmath136 in the model we go back to the first information spreading model studied in section [ sec : first ] where the gossip only spreads to friends of the victim . at each time - step the neighbors which already know the gossip repeatedly try to spread it to other friends of the victim .",
    "therefore , one expects to attain the same value of @xmath9 that one measured for @xmath137 , but this time only after a larger spreading time , namely @xmath149 .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] shows the result of such information propagation regime for the school networks . and",
    "for several values of @xmath136 .",
    "the corresponding curves of @xmath9 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig14]b .",

    "the insets show the same data for the ba network with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . after knowing the gossip each node tries to spread it only once ( see text ) . in all plots",

    "as expected , for all other values the spread factor coincides with the one for @xmath137 , while the spreading time preserves its logarithmic dependence on @xmath7 for large degrees , and the exponent increases with @xmath157,as explained below .    in the insets of both plots in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] we show for comparison the spreading time @xmath8 and spread factor @xmath9 for a ba network with @xmath60 and @xmath59 . a strong deviation from the logarithmic dependence of the spreading time",
    "is observed , due to the high number of initial outgoing connections ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the logarithmic dependence of the spreading time can be more easily seen when studying the apollonian network as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] . here",
    "we plot the spreading time for @xmath71 different values of @xmath136 and fit all of them with a logarithmic function as the one in eq .",
    "( [ tau - k ] ) .",
    "the corresponding slope @xmath151 as a function of @xmath136 is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] and follows closely a hyperbolic behavior , @xmath158 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ tau - k ] ) can be written more generally as @xmath159    finally , we can also assume that the person to which a gossip did not spread at the first attempt , will never get it . in this way , the gossip is a quantity which percolates through the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] we see the behavior of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for different values of @xmath136 for the school networks and in the inset for the ba network . when the spreading probability @xmath136 decreases , the minimum in @xmath9 first shifts to larger @xmath7 and finally disappears .",
    "the asymptotic logarithmic law of @xmath8 for large @xmath7 remains for all probabilities @xmath136 .",
    "as in previous cases , the ba network has a similar behavior as the school friendships .",
    "the apollonian network , however , behaves quite differently : @xmath8 first increases with @xmath136 and then eventually falls off to zero so that there exists a special value @xmath160 for which the spreading time @xmath8 is maximized .",
    "in this paper , we studied a general model of information spreading suited for different kinds of social information . in the usual case of rumour or opinion propagation the information spreads throughout the network , and all nodes are equally capable of transmiting the information to their neighbors .",
    "two measures were proposed to characterize the spreading of such model , namely , the spreading factor measuring the accessible neighborhood around each node which can be reached by the information spreading , and the spreading time which computes the minimum time to reach such neighborhood .    further , we have shown that by computing these quantities for each node the resulting distributions give additional insight to the underlying network structure on which the spreading takes place .",
    "more precisely , the magnitude of the skewness of the distribution of the spreading factor gives a measure of how difficult it is to access one neighbor , starting from another one .",
    "for positive values of the skewness , most of the pairs of neighbors are connected by some path of connections , while for negative values of the skewness , neighbors are more likely groupped in separated connected pairs .    in the particular case",
    "that the information is about a certain target - node and thus is of interest to a restricted neighborhood around it , one yields a minimal model to study gossip spreading .",
    "applying such a scheme to artifical and empirical networks , we found that , although different in their statistical properties , information on empirical social networks seems to spread similarly to what is observed in scale - free networks . in both cases ,",
    "the spreading time shows a logarithmic dependence on the degree , indicating small - world effect within the nearest neighborhood of the nodes .",
    "further , from the computation of the spreading factor we observed that there is a non - trivial optimal number of friends which minimizes the danger of being gossipped that depends on the size of the network and on total number of acquaintances in it .",
    "we also showed that this optimal value is characteristic of either scale - free networks or real social networks , but is not observed in small - world networks , rising the question of what network properties may give rise to the emergence of such an optimal value .",
    "however , when the information spreads beyond the nearest neighbors , in a similar way as for propagation of rumours and epidemics , this optimal value disappears with the spreading factor rapidly converging to @xmath30 .",
    "also the logarithmic dependence of the spreading time no longer holds in this case .",
    "since one person does not in general spread information to all its neighbors , neither at the same time nor with complete certainty , we also studied regimes of information propagation where the spreading from one node to another occurs with some probability @xmath136 .    due to their particular features and assumptions , our concepts and measures to address the propagation of information in networks",
    "could be suited to other situations .",
    "for instance , in the case of the internet , some trojan horses need to connect to a specific host to download some data in order to become effective . for them",
    "the spread factor should be a good measure to assess the vulnerability to the spreading of this virus attack .",
    "in this situation probably an experimental test of the emergence of the optimal degree found in the cases stated here could be easier to be implemented .",
    "the authors profitted from discussions with constantino tsallis , marta c.  gonzlez and ana nunes .",
