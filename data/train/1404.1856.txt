    "there often are reasons to suggest that bernoulli random variables , while identically distributed , may not be independent . for example , suppose pots are planted with six seeds each , where each pot has seeds from a unique plant , but different pot s seeds came from different plants .",
    "suppose that success of a seedling is well - defined .",
    "if genetic similarity is the dominant source of non - independence , it is reasonable to suppose positive association .",
    "however , if competition for nutrients and sunlight predominates , association could be negative .",
    "hence , it makes sense to find a functional form that gracefully allows for either positive or negative association .    ",
    "association \" here means something more general than correlation .",
    "correlation is a particular measure of association , familiar because of its connection with the normal distribution , and its simple relationship to certain expectations .",
    "however , there is no particular reason why correlation should be used in non - normal situations if it has undesirable properties .",
    "the desire for a functional form that allows for both positive and negative association runs into the following familiar fact , which is well - known , but for completeness is proved in appendix a :    suppose @xmath0 have ( possibly different ) means and variances and common pairwise correlations @xmath1",
    ". then @xmath2",
    ".    there are ( at least ) three different possible strategies for dealing with the asymmetry between positive and negative correlation revealed by the proposition :    * abandon correlation as a measure of association * abandon exchangeability of the bernoulli random variables * model the sum directly , without fully specifying the distribution of the underlying bernoulli random variables .",
    "some light on strategies b ) and c ) is shed by the following proposition , also proved in appendix  a.    [ prop2 ] let @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",

    "proposition  [ prop2 ] is reassuring with respect to strategy c ) , since the set of distributions on the @xmath8 s corresponding to an arbitrary distribution on their sum is non - empty .",
    "however , it also shows that one can assume exchangeability among the @xmath8 s without restricting the distribution of their sum , so strategy b ) is superfluous .",
    "( this fact is also a consequence of galambo s ( 1978 ) theorem 3.2.1 . )",
    "the distribution studied in this paper pursues strategies a ) and c ) simultaneously .",
    "there is a voluminous literature on sums of non - independent bernoulli random variables .",
    "an early paper of @xcite proposed the beta - binomial distribution , a beta mixture of binomials .",
    "thus , the underlying bernoulli random variables are exchangeable , so this proposal can model positive association , but not negative association ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "both models are exchangeable , and hence are limited in modeling negative association .",
    "@xcite propose an exchangeable model extending the binomial distribution , based on ideas of @xcite .",
    "once again the model is exchangeable , so the bounds on the common correlation allow a narrow band of negative correlations that rapidly diminish to zero as the sample size increases .",
    "awkwardly , the parameter constraints depend on the data .",
    "paul ( 1985 , 1987 ) proposes two models that aim to unify the beta - binomial and the kupper / haseman models .",
    "both suffer from the inevitable narrow range of negative correlations possible , and from data - dependent parameter constraints .    other papers discussing",
    "variations on exchangeable extensions of the binomial include @xcite and @xcite .    additionally , there is a paper discussing the sum of not - identically distributed bernouilli random variables with a common correlation @xcite .",
    "they apply their results in the context of multiple testing .",
    "two papers present two - state markov models , which of course in equilibrium have identically distributed margins , but are not necessarily exchangeable @xcite    by contrast , @xcite starts with a completely general class of discrete distributions , defined in a complicated sequential scheme",
    ". he then specializes it to the exchangeable case , but in general allows for arbitrary dependent structures .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : cmb ] introduces the conway - maxwell binomial distribution and displays some of its mathematical properties . section  [ sec : sufficient ]",
    "gives sufficient statistics and discusses a conjugate prior family .",
    "section  [ sec : understanding ] displays some examples , and gives expressions for its generating functions .",
    "the exchangeable case is examined is section  [ sec : exchangeability ] , and some applications are shown in section  [ sec : applications ] .",

    "the binomial distribution , the sum of independent bernoulli random variables , is extraordinarily useful .",

    "the probability mass function of the comb distribution is given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    ", the factor @xmath49 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "however , the propriety of the conjugate family is important for two reasons :    1 .",
    "the usual argument for updating prior to posterior in conjugate families depends on the constant of proportionality being finite .",
    "2 .   the proper behavior of numerical algorithms for computing posterior distributions , such as grid methods and markov chain monte carlo , also depend on the propriety of the posterior .    for those reasons",
    ", it makes sense to choose @xmath49 so that @xmath50 .",
    "there are additional reasons to do so .",
    "the function @xmath51 goes to infinity as @xmath52 if @xmath53 is positive , and to infinity as @xmath54 if @xmath53 is negative .",
    "hence , if one chose @xmath55 in , one would be declaring that extreme values of @xmath56 and @xmath25 are much more likely than others .",
    "this would , i judge , be an unusual belief .",
    "instead , i suspect that values of @xmath25 most likely to be of interest are those close to @xmath57 , and values of @xmath56 perhaps those close to zero .",
    "a simple choice expressing these ideas is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the normal probability density function . because the normal distribution goes to zero quickly for values far from its mean",

    "the comb distribution is a distribution on the sum of @xmath18 ( possibly dependent ) bernoulli components without specifying anything else about the joint distribution of those components .",
    "this section explores the consequences of assuming in addition that those components are exchangeable .    to establish notation ,",
    "let @xmath66 where each @xmath67 .",

    "because @xmath18-exchangeability applies to every permutation of length @xmath18 , it implies @xmath85 exchangeability for each @xmath86 . hence as @xmath18 increases , @xmath18-exchangeability becomes increasingly restrictive . in the limit at @xmath87 ,",
    "definetti s theorem shows that sums of exchangeable random variables are mixtures of binomial random variables . because the marginal distribution of each component is bernoulli , interest centers on the joint distribution of pairs of such variables . by exchangeability",
    ", every pair has the same distribution as every other pair , so concentrating on @xmath88 suffices .",

    "they use an mcmc with data augmentation to fit the model .",
    "the data themselves come from having planted six seedlings in each of 20 pots , and using the judgement of an expert as to which seedlings were successful .",
    "the goal was to examine the extent to which competition among the seedings affected the outcomes .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the sum of squared errors for the three models are as follows : binomial 8.96 ; cb 4.16 ; comb 3.77 .    it is notable that the comb estimate of @xmath25 is less than 1 , indicating positive association in the soybean seeds .",
    "this suggests that competition for nutrients is not the dominant phenomenon in this data set .",
    "further investigation and experimentation might then be warranted to discover the reasons for this positive association .",
    "the cb fit did find a positive correlation @xmath108 .",
    "however , the cb model requires @xmath109 and hence it could not have found a negative correlation .    in summary ,",
    "the comb model offers the following advantages over the cb model :    1 .",
    "it allows for both positive and negative association 2 .",
    "it allows for a conjugate analysis , obviating the need for an mcmc 3 .   at least for this data set and a squared error metric , it fits better , with the same number of parameters .    * b. killings in medieval norway *    in norway just after the viking period , the law distinguished a killing from a murder . in both ,",
    "there was somebody dead .",
    "however , in the former , the killer went to the king s representative within 24 hours and confessed .",
    "( absent such prompt confession , it would be a murder , punishable by execution or banishment ) .",
    "the king s representative would write a letter to the killer stating that the killer was under the protection of the king .",
    "an investigation would ensue , resulting in a second letter to the killer , specifying how much was owed to the king , and how much to the family of the deceased .",
    "there would then be receipts to the killer for the payments ( two more letters ) , and a final letter from the king s representative to the killer saying that it was all over .",
    "thus the killer would have received five letters .",
    "several hundred of these letters have survived in the intervening centuries , and a complete list of those found is available .",
    "additionally , there are mentions of killings in other documents such as private letters , bishop s records , etc .",
    "a simple representation of the data is a @xmath110 matrix , where the first dimension records the number of letters to the killer that survive , and the second is whether or not the killing is mentioned in other sources .",
    "of course , there is the @xmath111 cell of killings for which no letters survive and for which there are no other mentions . to estimate this cell , and hence the total number of killings , @xcite resort to a dual - systems estimate .",
    "since there s no obvious reason why the survival of letters in the killer s archive should be related to whether the killing is mentioned in the other sources , an independence assumption between the two dimensions seems reasonable . to model the number of letters from a given killing that might survive , a first thought",
    "might be a binomial model .",
    "however , since all five letters went to the killer , and were likely stored together , at least at first , it is reasonable to suppose that the event of the survival of a given letter to the killer would be positively associated with the event of the survival of the other letters to the same killer .",
    "thus one would expect @xmath112 in the comb , and kadane and naeshagen imposed a prior on @xmath25 putting zero probability on the space @xmath113 .",
    "as it happened , the data favors @xmath14 , so the posterior piled up at @xmath13 , the binomial model .",
    "nonetheless , this was a successful application of the comb , in that it allowed for ( and rejected ) what appeared to be the biggest reasonable threat to the model .",
    "the comb distribution deserves a place in the tool kit of a statistician .",
    "not all bernoulli random variables are independent , so a one - parameter extension of the binomial distribution , such as the com - binomial , may find other useful applications .",
    "suppose @xmath114 have the same means and variances , and identical correlations @xmath1",
    ". then @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath116 .",
    "then @xmath117 satisfy @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "because correlations are unaffected by location and scale changes , they still have common covariance @xmath1 .",
    "now @xmath120 from which the desired result follows immediately .    for each @xmath53",
    ", there are @xmath121 different arrangements of @xmath53 @xmath122 s and @xmath123 0 s .",
    "let each of them have probability @xmath124 .",

    "if the sum of the probabilities of the sequences with exactly @xmath53 1 s is not @xmath126 , the sum condition is violated .",
    "if their probabilities are not equal , exchangeability is violated .",
    "to obtain an upper bound on @xmath127 , a lower bound on @xmath128 is needed .",
    "i proceed from jensen s inequality , using the convexity of @xmath129 ( _ i.e. _ , the second derivative is negative ) :    let @xmath130 be arbitrary probabilities that are non - negative and sum to 1 .",
    "then @xmath131    now @xmath132    let @xmath133 be a random variable on the non - negative integers @xmath134 with probability mass @xmath135 .",
    "then the bound can be written as @xmath136 therefore @xmath137    substituting @xmath138 and collecting terms @xmath139    both the integral with respect to @xmath56 and that with respect to @xmath25 are of the form @xmath140 , which are normal integrals , and hence finite .",
