    "the inner ( @xmath8 1kpc ) parts of some spiral galaxies show star formation complexes frequently arranged in an annular pattern around their nuclei .",
    "these complexes are sometimes called `` hot spots '' and we will refer to these as circumnuclear starforming regions ( cnsfrs ) .",
    "their sizes go from a few tens to a few hundreds of pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they seem to be made of an ensamble of hii regions ionised by luminous compact stellar clusters whose sizes , as measured from high spatial resolution hst images , are seen to be of only a few pc .",
    "the luminosities of cnsfrs are rather large with absolute visual magnitudes ( m@xmath9 ) between -12 and -17 and h@xmath10 luminosities which are comparable to those shown by 30 dor , the largest hii region in the lmc , and overlap with those shown by hii galaxies ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) . in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , massive stars",
    "dominate the observed circumnuclear emission even in the presence of an active nucleus @xcite .    in many cases ,",
    "cnsfr show emission line spectra similar to those of disc hii regions . however , they show a higher continuum from background stellar populations as expected from their circumnuclear location .",
    "the analysis of these spectra gives us the oportunity to measure the gas abundances close to galactic nuclei which , in the case of early type spirals , are expected to be amongst the highest metallicity regions .    the importance of an accurate determination of the abundances of high metallicity hii regions can not be overestimated since they constitute most of the hii regions in early spiral galaxies ( sa to sbc ) and the inner regions of most late type ones ( sc to sd ) @xcite without which our description of the metallicity distribution in galaxies can not be complete . in particular , the effects of the choice of different calibrations on the derivation of abundance gradients can be very important since any abundance profile fit will be strongly biased towards data points at the ends of the distribution .",
    "it should be kept in mind that abundance gradients are widely used to constrain chemical evolution models , histories of star formation over galactic discs or galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "also , the question of how high is the highest oxygen abundance in the gaseous phase of galaxies is still standing and extrapolation of known radial abundance gradients would point to cnsfr as the most probable sites for these high metallicities .",
    "accurate measures of elemental abundances of high metallicity regions are also crucial to obtain reliable calibrations of empirical abundance estimators , widely used but poorly constrained , whose choice can severely bias results obtained for quantities of the highest relevance for the study of galactic evolution like the luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) relation for galaxies .",
    "as part of the programme to study the properties of cnsfr we obtained two sets of data with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) attached to the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) .",
    "the first set of observations consisted of high resolution blue and far - red long - slit spectra covering the emission lines of h@xmath1 and [ oiii ] and the caii triplet lines respectively . at the attained resolution of 0.4 and 0.7   respectively , these data allowed the measurement of radial velocities and velocity dispersions of the gas and stars in the regions down to 25 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the second set , also obtained with the same instrumentation had a lower resolution of 3.4 and 1.7   in the blue and red spectral regions respectively and a wider total coverage from 3600 to 9650  .",
    "these data were used to derive the physical conditions and the abundances of the emitting gas .",
    "several cnsfr were observed in the spiral galaxies : ngc  2903 , ngc  3351 and ngc  3504 .",
    "archive images obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2 and the nicmos camera 3 both on - board the hst were also downloaded in order to complement the study .",
    "figure [ images ] shows the optical image of ngc  3351 with the slit positions used for the two sets of observations .",
    "figure [ profiles ] shows the spatial distribution of the h@xmath1 and continuum emission along one of the slit positions observed .",
    "as can be seen from these profiles , some clusters are dominated by continuum emission while in other cases gaseous line emission is clearly important .",
    "gas velocity dispersions were measured by performing gaussian fits to the h@xmath1@xmath24861  and [ oiii ] @xmath2 5007   lines on the high dispersion spectra ( figure [ spectra - kin ] ) .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions dispersions were measured using the cat lines at @xmath128494 , 8542 , 8662using the cross - correlation technique described in detail by @xcite .",
    "late type giant and supergiant stars that have strong cat absorption lines were used as stellar velocity templates .",
    "+     for the 5 cnsfr observed in ngc  3351 , stellar velocity dispersions are found to be between 39 and 67kms@xmath11 , about 20kms@xmath11 larger than those measured for the gas , if a single gaussian fit is used . however , the best fits obtained involved two different components for the gas : a  broad component \" with a velocity dispersion similar to that measured for the stars , and a  narrow component \" with a dispersion lower than the stellar one by about 30kms@xmath11 . these two components were found both in the hydrogen recombination lines ( balmer and paschen ) and in the [ oiii ] @xmath2 5007   line .",
    "the narrow component is dominant in the h recombination lines , while the broad component dominates the [ oiii ] one .",
    "figure [ velocities ] shows this effect .",
    "cnsfr are seen to consist of several individual star clusters , although some of them seem to have an only knot , at the hst resolution .",
    "the derived masses for the individual clusters as derived using the sizes measured on the hst images are between 1.8 and 8.7@xmath1310@xmath14m@xmath15 .",
    "these values are between 5.5 and 26 times the mass derived for the ssc a in ngc1569 by @xcite and larger than other kinematically derived ssc masses .",
    "values for the dynamical masses of the cnsfrs are in the range between 4.9@xmath1310@xmath14 and 4.3@xmath1310@xmath3m@xmath15 .",
    "masses derived from the h@xmath1 velocity dispersion under the assumption of a single component for the gas would have been underestimated by factors between approximately 2 to 4 .",
    "the masses of the ionising stellar clusters of the cnsfrs have been derived from their h@xmath10 luminosities under the assumption that the regions are ionisation bound and without taking into account any photon absorption by dust .",
    "their values are between 8 - 0@xmath1310@xmath16 and 2.5@xmath1310@xmath14m@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the ionising stellar population to the total dynamical mass is between 0.02 and 0.16 .",
    "the ssc in the observed cnsfrs seem to contain composite stellar populations .",
    "although the youngest one dominates the uv light and is responsible for the gas ionisation , it constitutes only about 10% of the total .",
    "this can explain the low equivalent widths of emission lines measured in these regions .",
    "this may well apply to the case of other ssc and therefore conclusions drawn from fits of ssp ( single stellar population ) models should be taken with caution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also the composite nature of the cnsfrs means that star formation in the rings is a process that has taken place over time periods much longer than those implied by the properties of the ionised gas .",
    "for 12 cnsfrs in the galaxies ngc  2903 , ngc  3351 and ngc  3504 chemical abundances of o , n and s were derived from the lower resolution spectra .",
    "all the spectra are characterized by very weak [ oiii ] @xmath12 4959 , 5007   lines .",
    "figure [ weaklines ] shows the spectrum of a typical region .",
    "this low excitation is typical of high abundance regions in which the cooling is dominated by [ oii ] and [ oiii ] emission lines . in these cases the detection of the auroral [ oiii ] @xmath2 4363   line which woukd allow the derivation of the electron temperature is virtually impossible and empirical methods based on the calibration of strong emission lines have to be used .",
    "the most commonly used abundance indicator , o@xmath7 , involves the sum of the [ oii ] and [ oiii ] emission lines , supposed to be almost independent of geometrical effects in the nebulae .",
    "however , this indicator is not well calibrated at the high metallicity end where the oxygen lines are so weak that the value of the r@xmath7 practically saturates .",
    "the sulphur lines , much stronger than the oxygen lines in high metallicity regions , provide an alternative way to derive their abundances .",
    "we have developed a new method for the derivation of sulphur abundances based on the calibration of the [ siii ] electron temperature vs the empirical parameter so@xmath7 defined as the quotient of the oxygen and sulphur abundance parameters o@xmath7 and s@xmath7 and the further assumption that t([siii ] ) @xmath17 t([sii ] ) . then the oxygen abundances and the n / o and s / o ratios can also be derived .",
    "figure [ scalib ] shows this calibration for which data from different sources as listed in @xcite have been used .",
    "the actual fit to the data gives : @xmath18 ) = 0.596 - 0.283 log so_{23 } + 0.199 ( log so_{23})^2\\ ] ]    only for one of the regions , the [ siii ] @xmath2 6312   line was detected providing , together with the nebular [ siii ] lines at @xmath12 9069 , 9532   , a value of the electron temperature of t@xmath19([siii])= 8400@xmath20k .",
    "this value is slightly higher than predicted by the proposed fit and is represented as a solid upside down triangle in figure [ scalib ] .",
    "the derived oxygen abundances are comparable to those found in high metallicity disc hii regions from direct measurements of electron temperatures and are consistent with solar values within the errors .",
    "the highest oxygen abundance derived is 12+log(o / h ) = 8.85 , about 1.5 solar .",
    "= 8.66@xmath60.05 ] the lowest oxygen abundance derived is about 0.6 times solar . in all the observed cnsfr",
    "the o / h abundance is dominated by the o@xmath21/h@xmath21 contribution , as is also the case for high metallicity disc hii regions . for our observed regions ,",
    "however also the s@xmath21/s@xmath22 ratio is larger than one .",
    "this is not the case for the high metallicity disc hii regions for which , in general , the sulphur abundances are dominated by s@xmath22/h@xmath21 . the derived n / o ratios are in average larger than those found in high metallicity disc hii regions and they do not seem to follow the trend of n / o vs o / h which marks the secondary behaviour of nitrogen . on the other hand ,",
    "the s / o ratios span a very narrow range between 0.6 and 0.8 of the solar value .",
    "from the calculated values of the number of lyman @xmath10 photons , q(h@xmath23 ) , ionisation parameter and electron density , it is possible to derive the size of the emitting regions as well as the filling factor ( see * ? ? ? * ) .the derived sizes are between 1.5 arcsec and 5.7 arcsec which correspond to linear dimensions between 74 and 234 pc . the derived filling factors , between 6 @xmath13 10@xmath24 and 1 @xmath13 10@xmath25 , are lower than commonly found in giant hii regions ( @xmath8 0.01 ) .",
    "luminosities are larger than the typical ones found for disc hii regions and overlap with those measured in hii galaxies .",
    "the region with the largest h@xmath10 luminosity is r3+r4 in ngc  3504 , for which a value of 2.02 @xmath13 10@xmath26 is measured .",
    "ionising cluster masses range between 1.1 @xmath13 10@xmath27 and 4.7 @xmath13 10@xmath28 m@xmath5 but could be lower by factors between 1.5 and 15 if the contribution by the underlying stellar population is taken into account .",
    "these values are consistent with those found from the kinematical data set .",
    "when compared to high metallicity disc hii regions , cnsfr show values of the o@xmath7 and the n2 parameters whose distributions are shifted to lower and higher values respectively , hence , even though their derived oxygen and sulphur abundances are similar , higher values would in principle be obtained for the cnsfr if pure empirical methods were used to estimate abundances .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ abun ] where the distributions of the derived o / h abundances and the o@xmath7 pararameter for cnsfr and high metallicity disc hii regions are shown .    cnsfr also show lower ionisation parameters than their disc counterparts , as derived from the [ sii]/[siii ] ratio .",
    "their ionisation structure also seems to be different with cnsfr showing radiation field properties more similar to hii galaxies than to disc high metallicity hii regions .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ etaplot ] that shows [ oii]/[oiii ] ratio vs [ sii]/[siii ] .",
    "since the parameter @xmath29 , which is the quotient of these two ratios , is a good indicator of ionising temperature @xcite , diagonal lines in this plot should run along objects with similar temperatures .",
    "cnsfr in this diagram also segregate from the high metallicity disc hii regions pointing to higher values of the ionising temperature .",
    "the possible contamination of their spectra from hidden low luminosity agn and/or shocks , as well as the probable presence of more than one velocity component in the ionised gas corresponding to kinematically distinct systems ( see section 3 above ) , should be further investigated .",
