    "dust in the thin disks of spiral galaxies gives rise to substantial extinction , and the effects of this extinction dominate the optical appearance of spirals when viewed edge - on .",
    "recent work in the optical and submillimeter wavebands has shown that dust grains are not only to be found in the thin disks , but also far into the thick disks and halos of spiral galaxies ( zaritsky 1994 ; alton _ et al . _",
    "1998 ; block _ et al . _",
    "the energy input associated with star formation in spiral galaxies can expel dust grains and gas from their disks to the surrounding interstellar halos .",
    "the expulsion of grains from the disks of galaxies can be driven by violent hydrodynamical processes ( e.g. , norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) or more quiescent processes such as radiation pressure ( e.g. , davies _ et al . _",
    "this expulsion of gas and the heavy element - rich dust grains from the disks of galaxies may have important implications for the chemical evolution of intracluster or intergalactic media ( wiebe _ et al . _",
    "furthermore , if the dust is present in great enough quantities it can have important effects on the perceived distribution of light .",
    "but , until recently , little was known of the dust content of the interstellar medium ( ism ) far above the planes of galaxies .    in howk & savage ( 1997 , hereafter paper  i ) , we presented high - resolution optical images of the nearby edge - on spiral galaxy ngc  891 taken with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "these images reveal an extensive web of high-@xmath0  dust structures seen in absorption against the background stellar light of the bulge and thick stellar disk .",
    "figure [ fig : n891 ] shows a deep wiyn v - band image of ngc  891 ( top panel ; adapted from howk & savage 1999b , hereafter paper  iii ) .",
    "the absorbing dust structures are seen all along the imaged portion of the galaxy to heights approaching @xmath5 kpc .",
    "these dust - bearing clouds are optically thick and each contain significant amounts of mass ( @xmath6 m@xmath4 ) and very likely contain molecular material .    in this contribution",
    "i review our current understanding of the physical and statistical properties of such high-@xmath0  clouds in spiral galaxies (  [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "i also discuss the effects of these opaque high-@xmath0  dust clouds on quantitative measures of galaxy structure (  [ sec : light ] ) .",
    "in this section i summarize the observational state of our knowledge of high-@xmath0  dust - bearing clouds like those seen in figure [ fig : n891 ] and discuss briefly our theoretical understanding of these structures .",
    "our current observational understanding of extraplanar dust in normal spiral galaxies can be briefly summarized in three primary conclusions :    * 1 ) the observable dust - bearing clouds are clumpy and highly structured and can be viewed to heights @xmath7 kpc ; they have large opacities and likely trace large amounts of mass .",
    "*    figure [ fig : n891 ] shows that the distribution of high-@xmath0absorbing material in ngc  891 is complex . in a few cases the dust structures seem obviously to be tracing disk - halo outflows or interactions .",
    "however , the vast majority of the observable dust clouds show no immediate morphological connection with canonical chimney or superbubble phenomena ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the absorption due to this high-@xmath0  dust is significant , with each of the hundreds of dust - laden structures providing @xmath8 mag .",
    "these dust - bearing clouds , if they have galactic dust - to - gas ratios , have masses @xmath9 m@xmath4 , similar to the galactic giant molecular clouds .",
    "as an ensemble the clouds likely contain @xmath10 m@xmath4 , or approximately the same amount of mass as the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ; dettmar 1990 ) .",
    "the maintenance of such an extended layer of dusty material requires a significant amount of energy : the gravitational potential energy for each cloud is @xmath11 ergs ( paper  i ) .",
    "though our data are deep enough to reveal such clouds , there is a real paucity of structured dust - laden clouds at heights @xmath12 kpc ( paper  iii ) .    *",
    "2 ) extraplanar dust - bearing clouds are a common feature of spiral galaxies , and their existence is statistically correlated with the presence of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas . *    in howk & savage ( 1999a , hereafter paper  ii ) we presented short observations of all the _ truly _ edge - on , massive northern spiral galaxies within 25 mpc .",
    "table [ tab : statistics ] lists the seven such galaxies , and indicates whether they show evidence for extraplanar dust",
    ". also indicated is the presence or absence of extraplanar dig .",
    "the galaxies in this table are listed in order of decreasing far - infrared luminosity per unit disk area , a rough indicator of the star - formation rate per unit area .",
    "though there are a small number of truly edge - on galaxies in the survey volume , table [ tab : statistics ] shows a large fraction of local universe spirals contain extraplanar dust .",
    "furthermore , there is a one - to - one correlation between the presence ( or absence ) of extraplanar dust and the presence ( or absence ) of extraplanar dig .",
    "figure [ fig : n4013 ] shows a wiyn unsharp - masked v - band image of ngc  4013 ( paper  ii ) .",
    "the dust structures in this system have similar properties to those seen in ngc  891 ( see paper  ii ) . given the short exposure times required to identify such high-@xmath0",
    "absorbing structures , using dust as a tracer of interstellar matter in galaxy halos is much more efficient than h@xmath13  imaging .",

    "*    though there is a striking statistical correlation between the presence of high-@xmath0  dust and dig in spiral galaxies ( paper  ii ) , the morphology of the dust and the dig are extremely different .",
    "the h@xmath13emission from the halo of ngc  4013 ( rand 1996 ) is localized to only a few patches , and seems to be more smoothly distributed within those patches , whereas the high-@xmath0  dust absorption is visible along most of the length of the galaxy and is highly structured .    a more detailed , direct comparison between the h@xmath13  and dust morphologies for ngc  891 is given in paper  iii .",
    "figure [ fig : n891 ] shows an unsharp - masked version of the wiyn h@xmath13  image immediately below the v - band unsharp - masked image . comparing the two images in figure [ fig : n891 ] , one is left with the ( correct ) impression that the h@xmath13  distribution is much smoother with less pronounced , and fewer , filamentary structures .",
    "the comparison of the h@xmath13  and broadband data for ngc  891 ( paper  iii ) suggest that we are observing two distinct `` phases '' of the ism with these two probes of thick disk matter .",
    "the h@xmath13  images trace an ionized , low - density medium , while the dust structures seen in absorption are tracing a dense , neutral phase of the high-@xmath0  ism . in standard models of thermal phase equilibrium for disk of the milky way ,",
    "a dense phase of the ism is present only if the pressure of the medium is high enough ( e.g. , wolfire _",
    "et al . _",
    "rough calculations of the pressure distribution of the dig and hot ism in ngc  891 suggest that these media provide a sufficient external pressure to allow for the existence of a dense neutral phase ( see paper  ii ) . that virtually no clouds are observable at heights in excess of @xmath24 kpc",
    "may imply that the pressure is insufficient to support the dense clouds above this height .",
    "if this is the case , there may very well be unobserved dust at heights in excess of 2 kpc ( our images are only sensitive to clouds that are overdense relative to their surroundings ) .",
    "in general we do not expect a cold , neutral phase of the ism at high-@xmath0  to be directly associated with the extraplanar dig .",
    "the interpretation that the observed dust clouds represent the dense phase of a multiphase medium at high-@xmath0  is also supported by two recent observational results .",
    "garca - burillo _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1999 ) have presented high - resolution co maps of the inner portion of ngc  4013 showing extraplanar co features far above the plane of the galaxy .",
    "_ many of these co features are directly associated with high-@xmath0  dust structures observable in our wiyn images . _",
    "the presence of a dense phase of the thick disk ism is also implied by our own discovery of h@xmath25ii  regions far above the planes of ngc  891 and ngc  4013 ( see paper  iii ) .",
    "in ngc  891 these candidate nebulae are associated with faint , blue continuum sources at heights @xmath26 kpc .",
    "these objects likely represent young stellar associations formed far above the plane of the galaxy , perhaps in the dense clouds visible in our wiyn images .",
    "the presence of dense dust - laden ( molecular ) clouds in the thick interstellar disks of spiral galaxies affects the perceived vertical distribution of light in these systems .",
    "the absorption due to these clouds will not only affect the perceived distribution of stellar light , but will also affect light produced by the high-@xmath0  gas layers ( e.g. , h@xmath13  or x - ray emission ) . in paper",
    "iii  we have shown that much of the structure perceived in the h@xmath13  emission from the dig at heights @xmath27 kpc from the midplane of ngc  891 is caused by the patchy absorption of these dense clouds .",
    "figure [ fig : cuts ] shows the vertical light distribution for a region near the center of ngc  891 , averaged over 45 pc in the radial direction and normalized to the intensity of each bandpass at @xmath28 kpc .",
    "the impact of discrete absorbing clouds can be seen in these vertical cuts .",
    "for example , quite prominent dust structures are intercepted at @xmath29 kpc .",
    "one can see by comparing the b- and i - band curves in figure [ fig : cuts ] that the distribution of light at heights @xmath30 kpc is severely affected by the presence of extraplanar interstellar dust",
    ". fits to the light distribution at heights less than this will be dominated by dust absorption .",
    "figure [ fig : cuts ] also shows that ngc  891 gets _ bluer _ with distance from the midplane to a height of @xmath31 kpc , indicating that large amounts of dust are present at great heights .",
    "most studies of the structure of nearby galaxies employ images taken in much poorer seeing than ours .",
    "this has the effect of washing out the discreet , small - scale dust structures .",
    "typical high-@xmath0  dust features in the thick disk of ngc  891 have minor axis sizes of order 100 pc ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "images taken in seeing @xmath33 show relatively little direct evidence for the widespread , complicated distribution of dust seen in our higher resolution data .",
    "the high-@xmath0  dust structures have two important effects on the perceived vertical distribution of light .",
    "first , it tends to flatten the observed distribution of emission , making the scale height of the light seem _ larger _ than the true scale height .",
    "second , since the dust is more prevalent at low @xmath0-heights , it can also cause two distinct vertical components ( e.g. , thin and thick disks ) to appear as one in lower resolution data .",
    "single exponential fits to smoothed versions of our wiyn b - band data ( simulating seeing of @xmath34 ) , for example , yield a scale height @xmath35 kpc with a linear correlation coefficient @xmath36 ( fitting only the light above @xmath37 kpc in log space ) .",
    "the true distribution of emission , however , is likely similar to the i - band , where two components are clearly seen : a thin disk whose scale height is uncertain because of the dust ( xilouris _ et al . _  1998",
    "derive @xmath38 kpc ) and a thick disk with scale height of order @xmath39 kpc ( morrison _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the effects of extraplanar dust on the perceived light distribution in spiral galaxies can be extremely important for studies attempting to derive fundamental morphological properties of these systems .",
    "this is true for studies of the starlight as well as studies of emission from the ism above the planes of spirals , including h@xmath13  and soft x - ray emission ."
