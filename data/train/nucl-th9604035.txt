    "<S> the low - mass dielectron signal from heavy - ion collisions at the cern  sps reported by the _ ceres _ </S>",
    "<S> collaboration is in excess of estimated hadronic decays suggestive of possible contribution from two - pion annihilation or other hadronic reactions . in the absence of dramatic medium modifications , </S>",
    "<S> annihilation alone is unable to account for the data . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the role of pion plus resonance scattering [ @xmath0 which has favorable kinematics to populate masses between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> while it seems to account for some of the remaining excess beyond annihilation , it fails to allow quantitative interpretation of data .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamics of high - energy heavy - ion collisions can be probed , at least in principle , by photons and dileptons since they are produced continuously from the first moments of nuclear contact throughout the entire evolution and interact only weakly through electromagnetic coupling to the hadronic medium . </S>",
    "<S> their mean free paths are many times greater than typical reaction - zone sizes allowing them to bring out valuable information on the earlier stages . </S>",
    "<S> since their utility for heavy - ion collisions was first proposed@xcite , many theoretical calculations have been done@xcite predicting orders of magnitude for production , exploring ideas about phase transition to quark matter and possible medium modifications to hadronic phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> recently an intriguing report from cern@xcite brought forth results for dielectron signals observed in heavy - ion induced reactions as compared with proton - induced results . </S>",
    "<S> while the p+be and p+au data at 450 gev were not inconsistent with estimations from hadronic decays , the s+au results showed an enhancement by a factor of 5.0@xmath3 2.7 over hadronic decay contributions when integrated over mass from 0.2 to 1.5 gev .    the natural conclusion drawn from these theoretical estimates and experimental data was that the excess is most probably due to @xmath4 annihilation in a heated hadronic environment . </S>",
    "<S> but since the excess is pronounced for masses near 500 mev and lower , this is not obviously annihilation . if not , then what ? </S>",
    "<S> perhaps we are seeing the rho mass shifting downward by several hundred mev due to the presence of the medium@xcite ; or perhaps we are seeing effects of modified pion dispersion relations@xcite . both phenomena would be spectacular if only we could unequivocally establish their influences which at this stage are matters of discussion . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , prediction for direction and magnitude of mass shifts at finite energy density are not yet settled as the literature bears opposing results@xcite . taking the point of view </S>",
    "<S> to use free space masses and widths ( and including a collision broadening for @xmath5 ) , we show in this letter that the `` excess '' dielectron signal is due in part due to @xmath4 annihilation , but could have important contributions from pion - resonance @xmath6 scattering .    consider a central collision of sulfur on gold at 200 gev / u which will produce a `` fire cylinder '' of transverse radius @xmath7 equal to that of the sulfur nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the question of initial energy densities and qcd phase transition are quite interesting but will not be discussed in any detail here . only to note that assuming isentropic expansion and relating observed rapidity densities to initial times and temperatures@xcite , @xmath8 is quite high  of the order 350 mev . instead , </S>",
    "<S> if either the mixed phase ( of quark and hadron coexistence ) or pure plasma phase is reached , the additional degrees of freedom will effectively keep the temperature lower . </S>",
    "<S> this is the picture envisioned so that @xmath8 is of the order 180 mev . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of relativistic transport@xcite support this picture since they are able to reproduce transverse mass spectra for both pions and protons with an initial temperature of @xmath9 185 mev and a finite chemical potential @xmath10 mev . </S>",
    "<S> being only somewhat above the critical value of temperature obtained from lattice calculations@xcite for entering the plasma phase , we neglect contributions from quark processes . </S>",
    "<S> the system expands and cools very quickly until the mixed phase is reached when hadronic contributions begin thermally producing dielectrons at @xmath11 for a few fm/@xmath12 until the matter is found to be in a complete hadronic phase . </S>",
    "<S> it cools and expands further until collisions can no longer support the nearly isotropic momentum distributions and freezes out .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed spectrum of dielectrons will consist of several components , each coming from different mechanisms and possibly different stages of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> below 150 mev mass a nonthermal component of @xmath13 and @xmath14 dalitz dominates and the observed yields are consistent with estimates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hadronic radiative decays will contribute to higher masses and the largest seems to be @xmath15@xcite , although there are recent suggestions that partial @xmath16 restoration could modify @xmath17 physics in ways relevant for this experiment@xcite and boost @xmath17 dalitz to a more important level . </S>",
    "<S> direct decay of vector mesons @xmath18 and @xmath19 will also be a strong source of pairs but fairly near their free space masses . </S>",
    "<S> production of a nonzero four volume of hot matter generates contribution from pion annihilation @xmath20 , whose strength depends on the average temperature . in this four volume there are myriad hadronic reactions able to produce pairs . a systematic treatment of decays and annihilation , i.e. lowest order treatment in the strong coupling has been done@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond lowest order is required for this discussion as @xmath21 comes from a two - loop contribution . </S>",
    "<S> elastic scattering of @xmath22 s with @xmath5 s is dominated by resonant @xmath23 formation as the average @xmath24 for @xmath25 mev is near the centroid of the rather broad @xmath23 mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath23 has a radiative decay channel as well , it follows that scattering can produce real or virtual photons . for real energetic photon production </S>",
    "<S> , the reaction @xmath26 has been shown to be very important@xcite . as @xmath27 phase space shrinks to a point and this mechanism contributes nothing . </S>",
    "<S> zero invariant mass for virtual photons does not require zero energy as @xmath28 and @xmath29 could separately be very large . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the amplitude for @xmath21 will go like @xmath30 for small mass . near the rho </S>",
    "<S> , vector dominance takes over and the amplitude goes like @xmath31 . a completely equivalent and alternative approach to estimating </S>",
    "<S> the role of the @xmath23 as considered here would be to compute @xmath32 starting from a thermal distribution of charged @xmath23 s properly modified by a breit - wigner distribution in mass@xcite owing to its finite width .    </S>",
    "<S> more general techniques of field theory at finite temperature unambiguously determine the total contribution@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rate for producing electron pairs is related to the imaginary part of the retarted photon self - energy which , to one - loop order , corresponds to decay and annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the pion - resonance scattering process being of two - loop order would require additional renormalization and the added nuisance of an additional matsubara sum , but the prescription is clear . as the field </S>",
    "<S> theoretic methods are completely equivalent to kinetic theory at given order in the coupling , the latter is chosen for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> it builds upon evaluating tree - level feynman diagrams and folding thermal momentum distributions with transition amplitudes to arrive at an average rate in medium for a given process . for instance , the dominant @xmath23 resonant graph contributing to @xmath6 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman ] . interference and other meson - exchange effects will be reported upon separately@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the intermediate rho suggests using a vector - dominance form factor whose width is taken to be a function of temperature to include collision broadening . </S>",
    "<S> it is computed just as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite but including finite pion chemical potential and then parametrized for 100 @xmath33 200 mev by @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the free space width and @xmath36 gev , @xmath37 and @xmath38 gev@xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> an effective lagrangian for axial - vector  vector  pseudoscalar interaction is chosen for simplicity to be the following@xcite @xmath40v_{\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are respectively , axial - vector , vector and pseudoscalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> a treatment of this interaction from a chiral lagrangian approach has yielded results for photon production roughly consistent with those from this less complicated parametrization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant is adjusted to give a decay @xmath43 = 400 mev@xcite to match the particle data group@xcite value and the coupling of @xmath23 to @xmath22 and @xmath44 is then taken to be the vector - dominance value of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the coupling of rho to pions . </S>",
    "<S> numerically these turn out to be @xmath47 = 16.1 gev@xmath39 and @xmath48 = 0.81 gev@xmath39 for @xmath49 = 1230 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting prediction for the radiative decay width @xmath50 is 1.9 mev , which is somewhat larger than the 0.640@xmath3 0.246 mev obtained from a sole measurement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , rates for photon or dilepton production from @xmath51 scattering through the @xmath23 might be corresponingly lower than this approach would indicate .    the invariant rate for thermally producing a lepton pair of mass @xmath52 and individual three momenta @xmath53 and @xmath54 via the process @xmath55 can be written generally as @xmath56 \\label{eq : rate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is an overall degeneracy factor , @xmath58 $ ] and so on , @xmath59 is the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath60 to account for medium ( bose ) enhancements and @xmath61 is the initial spin averaged and final spin summed squared matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> integration over the full individual lepton three momenta can be additionally performed to arrive at the total rate for given mass . however , the differential rate is more useful here since limited transverse momentum and rapidity ranges can then be integrated to approximate experimental configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> if we ignore the bose enhancement then the rate can be simplified as @xmath62 \\label{eq : rate2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the first modified bessel function . for completeness , the cross section in brackets is @xmath65.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] first , we integrate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rate2 ] ) to get the total rate @xmath66 . to faciliate comparison with other rates from the literature we temporarily ignore collision broadening and set the pion chemical potential to zero . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rate ] the rates from @xmath4 annihilation are compared with @xmath6 . formulas for annihilation are not shown because they are by now textbook expressions@xcite and have been recently used in a similar study@xcite . for additional comparison </S>",
    "<S> we show also an estimate of pion scattering with bremsstrahlung@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all three contributions become roughly the same around 350 mev mass , which is the lower end of the window of the observed excess over hadronic decays . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanisms have different @xmath67 distributions for the leptons which will become important when kinematic restrictions are imposed . at the rho mass </S>",
    "<S> the two - pion annihilation is a factor of four above the @xmath68 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we can expect this number since it is precisely the ratio of thermal production rates of neutral rho mesons via the two mechanisms @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath71 at @xmath72 = 160 mev .    in order to compare with experiment an integration of these rates over a spacetime evolution </S>",
    "<S> must be preformed . </S>",
    "<S> we assume for utmost simplicity boost - invariant expansion@xcite and neglect any transverse flow effects . </S>",
    "<S> this will provide a first estimate only while the need for dynamic model calculations is duely noted . </S>",
    "<S> choice of specific times or temperatures must be made . </S>",
    "<S> here we take @xmath73 mev , @xmath74 mev , @xmath75 mev and @xmath10 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the rho is again assigned a collision broadened width . </S>",
    "<S> total yield is the sum of contributions from the mixed plus cooling phases@xcite . written out in detail , </S>",
    "<S> it is @xmath76 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\ & + 3\\pi r_{t}^{2}t_{i}^{6}\\tau_{i}^{2}r^{2 } \\int\\limits_{t_{f}}^{t_{c } } { dt\\over t^{7}}\\,{d^{3}\\ell_{+}\\over e_{+}}{d^{3}\\ell_{-}\\over e_{-}}\\ , \\left[e_{+}e_{-}{dn\\over d^{4}x\\,dm\\,d^{3}\\ell_{+}d^{3}\\ell_{- } } \\right ] , \\label{eq : yield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the ratio of degrees of freedom in qgp phase to that of hadron phase and is @xmath9 12 . </S>",

    "<S> are limited to @xmath79 200 mev/@xmath12 and pseuodrapidities by 2.1 @xmath80 2.65 . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a cut in the experiment on angular separation for the pairs @xmath81 35 mrad to avoid resolution difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore this limitation here as it should only have small influence on the result for masses greater than 200 mev . finally , we normalize just as in the experiment by dividing the yield @xmath82 by the average charged particle pseudorapidity density @xmath83 = 125 .    </S>",
    "<S> having established the ranges kinematics `` visible '' by the experiment , the rate from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rate ] ) can be obtained and then the convolution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : yield ] ) performed . the resulting normalized yield after performing a mass - resolution smearing might then be directly compared with the distribution observed by the _ </S>",

    "<S> partial and total yield estimates are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : yield ] as dashed ( @xmath4 annihilation ) , dot - dashed ( @xmath68 scattering ) , dotted ( hadronic decays as presented in ref.@xcite ) and solid ( total of annihilation , scattering and decays ) . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the @xmath23 seems to account for part of the excess but still leaves the door open for other possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> additional pairs could be coming from @xmath84 and @xmath85@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they could also be coming from decays not already considered and possibly even a bremsstrahlung component@xcite .    as a brief summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out that the recently observed dielectron signal being in excess of hadronic decays in s+au collisions at 200 gev / u is likely coming not only from @xmath4 annihilation as was suggested , but could also be partly due to pion plus resonance @xmath6 scattering . the picture emerging for thermal production of low - mass dielectrons becomes richer and more challenging as it calls for next - to - leading order treatments of the photon self - energy , i.e. @xmath86 body reactions ( including the leptons ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not too surprising however , as there are many hadronic reactions of type @xmath87 for the full set of light mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the present result for @xmath68 scattering suggests that moving towards quantitative interpretation of the _ ceres _ data will require consideration of such processes . </S>"
