    "the su  uma stars are a subclass of dwarf novae ( dn ) whose light curves exhibit superoutburst behaviour .",
    "superoutbursts typically occur at intervals of several months , interspersed with normal outbursts every few weeks . in general , superoutbursts are around one magnitude brighter than normal outbursts and last a few weeks rather than 2 - 3 days .",
    "wz  sagittae is an unusual su  uma star because the recurrence time is extremely long and no normal outbursts are observed between superoutbursts .",
    "superoutbursts occurred in 1913 , 1946 , 1978 and 2001 , with the last of these coming somewhat earlier than expected after the previously regular recurrence time @xmath2 years .",
    "normal outbursts in dn can be explained by a thermal - viscous disc instability due to the partial ionisation of hydrogen ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the standard disc instability model ( dim ) assumes that the viscosity of the disc material increases by around one order of magnitude during outburst , enhancing the mass - flow rate through the disc .",
    "the usual values adopted for the @xcite viscosity parameter are @xmath3 in quiescence and @xmath4 in outburst . in an extension to this theory",
    ", @xcite proposed that superoutbursts are due to a thermal - tidal instability . during each normal outburst ,",
    "only a small fraction of the total disc mass is deposited onto the white dwarf ( wd ) , leading to an accumulation of disc mass and angular momentum .",
    "the outer disc radius therefore expands until the tidal radius is reached . at this point ,",
    "enhanced tidal interaction with the secondary star is thought to increase dissipation in the disc and so raise the mass accretion rate .",
    "a superoutburst may then be triggered .",
    "this model successfully explains the superoutburst behaviour of ordinary su  uma stars using the same viscosity parameters as the standard disc instability model ( dim ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the viscosity in wz  sge must be far lower than the standard values ( so that @xmath5 ) , for the following reasons : + * smak 1 * in the standard dim , the inter - outburst recurrence time is governed by the viscous time - scale of the inner accretion disc , which is far shorter than the observed value of @xmath6 .",
    "lowering @xmath7 slows down the viscous evolution of the accretion disc , increasing the inter - outburst time . + * smak 2 * integrating the critical surface density using the standard dim @xmath7 gives a maximum disc mass that is far lower than the observed estimate of the mass accreted during superoutburst , @xmath8 . lowering the viscosity allows more mass to be accumulated in the outer regions of the accretion disc to fuel the outburst accretion rate .",
    "+    there is however no obvious reason why the quiescent accretion disc in wz sge should have a much lower viscosity than the other su  uma stars .",
    "this has led a number of authors to suggest other reasons to account for the long recurrence time and high disc mass prior to superoutburst .    in order to produce a long recurrence time without requiring a low @xmath7 the inner , most unstable regions of the disc",
    "must be stabilized . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find that the disc can be stabilized if the inner regions are removed , either by evaporation into a coronal layer ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by the presence of a magnetosphere .",
    "this need not necessarily lead to an increased recurrence time however .",
    "models by @xcite suggest a marginally stable disc that requires an episode of enhanced mass transfer to trigger a disc outburst .",
    "the recurrence time in this model is governed by the mass transfer fluctuation cycle , which has no obvious physical connection with the regular 33 year outburst cycle observed in wz  sge .",
    "@xcite also find that under certain conditions the disc will be marginally unstable and produce outside - in outbursts with the required recurrence time ( we explore the case of a marginally stable disc in section [ sec : cod ] ) .",
    "however , neither of these models addresses the problem of how to accumulate enough disc mass during quiescence to explain the mass accreted in outburst * ( smak 2)*. only @xmath9 is available in the disc just prior to outburst so that both of the above models require mass to be added to the disc during the outburst .",
    "the authors appeal to irradiation of the secondary star to increase the transfer rate during outburst and supply the missing mass .",
    "@xcite only produce normal outbursts , not superoutbursts in their model .",
    "the reason for this is that their disc radius @xmath10 is far smaller than the tidal radius , so enhanced tidal interaction with the secondary ( required to produce a superoutburst ) is not possible .    in this paper",
    "we argue that the value of @xmath7 in wz sge may be consistent with standard dim values ( @xmath11 ) . in section [ sec :",
    "qui ] we perform a similar calculation to @xcite adopting the system parameters suggested by @xcite . for a fixed disc mass",
    "we find that @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the outer disc radius ) , and show that a value of @xmath14 , and a moderate increase in @xmath15 results in a value for @xmath16 consistent with observation .",
    "we then obtain a similar value for @xmath7 by estimating the cool viscous time - scale from the observed superoutburst profile .",
    "x - ray observations of wz sge by @xcite have revealed a coherent 27.86 s oscillation in the asca 2 - 6 kev energy band ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the most convincing explanation for these data is that wz sge contains a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "a paper by @xcite interprets wz sge as a dq  her star and the 27.86 s oscillation as the spin period of the white dwarf ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the authors then suggest that wz  sge is an ejector system : i.e. most of the material transferred from the secondary is ejected from the system , similar to the case of ae aqr @xcite . in this model",
    "an accretion disc is recreated in outburst , which again is triggered by a mass transfer event .    in section [ sec : mag ] we suggest that if the magnetic torque is not sufficient to eject mass completely from the system , but merely propels it further out into the roche lobe of the wd ( we refer to the system as a weak magnetic propeller ) , then * ( smak 1 ) * and * ( smak 2 ) * can be explained with a standard dim value for @xmath7 .",
    "the injection of angular momentum into the disc by the propeller radically alters the surface density profile , compared with that of a conventional dim disc .",
    "the inner disc in such a system is empty , and outbursts can not therefore be triggered there in the normal way .",
    "the propeller also inhibits accretion , and mass accumulates in the outer disc , increasing the recurrence time significantly .",
    "the disc may also be forced to expand to the tidal radius ( and a little beyond ) which could allow further material to accumulate in the outer regions of the disc before triggering an outburst .",
    "this would increase the recurrence time and outburst mass still further , solving * ( smak 1 ) * and * ( smak 2)*. the outburst is initiated as in the standard dim , and does not require any episode of enhanced mass transfer .",
    "simulations are performed in one and two dimensions .",
    "the former are computationally cheap , so that we can present several outburst cycles , but can not account for the enhanced mass storage due to tidally drive disc expansion .    in section [ sec : obs ]",
    "we discuss the observational evidence for a truncated accretion disc with reference to observed spin periods and spectral data .",
    "both these results support are in agreement with a truncated disc . in section [ sec : spi ]",
    "we consider the spin evolution of the wd , and whether a spin cycle might exist .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : dis ] the applications to other cvs are discussed .",
    "following @xcite we estimate a value for @xmath7 by considering the disc mass immediately prior to outburst .",
    "an outburst is triggered when the surface density at some radius @xmath20 becomes greater than the maximum value ( @xmath21 ) allowed on the cool branch of the @xmath22 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at that radius",
    ". therefore , the maximum possible disc mass prior to outburst is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath13 are the inner and outer disc radii respectively .",
    "calculations of the vertical disc structure yield ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of the wd in solar masses , @xmath27 cm , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the mean molecular weight . assuming that @xmath30 and setting @xmath31 , equations ( [ int ] ) and ( [ sig ] ) can be combined to give @xmath32 although wz  sge has a long observational history , the values of some of its fundamental parameters are still uncertain . for instance , @xcite deduces that @xmath33 and @xmath34 , whereas the spectroscopic observations of @xcite ( sr hereafter ) lead to values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 . @xcite",
    "point out that a white dwarf mass of @xmath33 is too small if it is assumed to be rotating with a period of 27.87 s ( although @xmath35 is possibly too high ) , so for the purposes of this paper we shall adopt the system masses suggested by sr .",
    "we also adopt an orbital period of @xmath37 minutes .",
    "@xcite estimated the total mass accreted during outburst to be around @xmath38-@xmath39 . setting @xmath40 , and using the system parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( sr ) , we find from equation ( [ mass ] ) that @xmath44 . while this value is around a factor of 2 lower than the standard dim value of @xmath3 , it is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the value obtained by smak .",
    "however , setting @xmath45 , we find @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath7 is very sensitive to disc radius",
    ". therefore , any error in the observationally inferred value will produce a large discrepancy in @xmath7 . the observational estimate in sr ( @xmath47 )",
    "was determined from models of the accretion stream disc impact region , which was found to be rather extended in the case of wz  sge .",
    "a theoretical estimate of the tidal radius can be found by utilizing smoothed particle hydrodynamic calculations assuming the system parameters detailed above .",
    "this approach yields a tidal radius of @xmath48 ( see section [ sec : threed ] ) . assuming this value for @xmath13 and repeating the above calculation we find that @xmath49 , in good agreement with the standard dim value .",
    "we note that the analytic treatment of @xcite gives a similar @xmath13 when the same parameters are used .",
    "a second , independent estimate of @xmath7 can be obtained using the observed outburst profiles @xcite .",
    "superoutbursts have similar observational profiles to the outbursts of x - ray transients @xcite , i.e. they have a rapid rise to outburst maximum , followed by an exponential decay on the hot viscous time - scale until the disc is no longer hot enough to remain fully ionized and falls into quiescence .",
    "this produces a steep decline in brightness on a thermal time - scale followed by a slower decline as the disc readjusts on the cool viscous time - scale    fig [ fig : kuulkers ] ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) presents the visual lightcurves for the 1913 , 1946 and 1978 outbursts .",
    "it is possible to determine @xmath7 by considering the visual luminosity as the disc returns to quiescence , i.e. @xmath50 after the outburst began .",
    "this is more difficult in the case of the 2001 outburst since the lightcurve is complicated by the presence of echo outbursts .",
    "the disc brightness decays exponentially on the cool viscous time - scale @xmath51 ( this is clearly seen in the 1946 outburst , but is less obvious in 1978 ) , such that the visual luminosity is given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is time and the cold viscous time - scale is given by @xmath54 the cold state viscosity is given by @xcite @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the adiabatic sound speed , and @xmath57 is the disc scale height . during quiescence",
    "the disc temperature is @xmath58 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath30 , the sound speed is then @xmath59 .",
    "we consider the part of the disc from which the majority of the emission should come during the cold viscous decay , namely @xmath60 .",
    "viscous dissipation is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the disc angular frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the very inner part of the disc is evacuated , while the outer part has a low angular frequency so that our estimate for @xmath63 seems sensible .",
    "we further assume that @xmath64 for a geometrically thin disc . from the 1946 outburst lightcurve",
    "it can be seen that , as the disc falls into quiescence , the visual flux drops by one magnitude in @xmath65 . from equation ( [ tvisc ] ) we find @xmath66 , in reasonable agreement with the estimate in section [ sec : qdm ] .",
    "in sections [ sec : qdm ] and [ sec : ext ] we have argued that the value of @xmath7 in wz  sge may not be different from that in other dn .",
    "this is consistent with the observed @xmath67 , if @xmath68 , and with the decay time of outbursts .",
    "however the recurrence time problem * ( smak 1 ) * still remains unresolved .",
    "the observation of a 27.87 oscillation in the quiescent x - ray lightcurve of wz  sge @xcite suggests that the white dwarf is magnetic .",
    "the introduction of a magnetic field to a rapidly rotating white dwarf raises the possibility of increasing the recurrence time by removing the inner , most unstable regions of the accretion disc .",
    "this is a result of the magnetic torque which can , rather than accreting the inner disc , force mass close to the white dwarf to larger radii .",
    "this magnetic propeller effect occurs when the stellar magnetic field moves more rapidly than the disc material so that the disc gains angular momentum at the expense of the star .",
    "the inner disc can be depleted by the propeller and the surface density profile of the disc will then be altered as material is forced to orbit further out in the disc , at radii close to the tidal limit .",
    "the magnetic propeller inhibits accretion so that mass is forced to build up in the outer disc , where the critical surface density is higher and the @xmath69 evolution time - scale ( @xmath70 ) is longer .",
    "the magnetic propeller effect can not therefore only increase @xmath71 but can also allow the disc to accumulate enough mass prior to outburst to supply an increased @xmath72 , with the outer disc acting as a large reservoir of mass . in this way both * ( smak 1 ) * and * ( smak 2 ) * can be explained simultaneously with a standard value for @xmath7 , and without appealing to episodes of enhanced mass transfer .",
    "it should be noted that disc truncation is not normally , in itself , sufficient to increase recurrence times .",
    "@xcite show this by considering the evaporation of the inner disc .",
    "the fundamental difference between the magnetic propeller and other mechanisms such as evaporation and magnetically enhanced accretion is that the propeller causes a build - up of mass in the outer disc by preventing accretion onto the white dwarf ( during quiescence only ) .",
    "the overall profile of the disc is therefore completely altered , permitting much more mass to be stored in the disc .",
    "the mechanism presented here is analogous to that which was proposed by @xcite to explain long recurrence times in fu  ori type young stellar objects .",
    "the magnetic propeller should , in forcing the disc outwards , aid access to the 3:1 resonance .",
    "it is likely therefore that further mass will be stored in the outer disc , as proposed by @xcite , providing an even larger reservoir @xmath73 for mass between outbursts .",
    "this tidal effect may therefore amplify the result of the weak propeller driving recurrence times to become even longer .    in the remainder of this section we outline the theoretical basis for the magnetic propeller model , and present the results of numerical experiments .",
    "we adopt a description for the magnetic interaction which assumes that as material moves through the magnetosphere it interacts with the local magnetic field via a velocity dependent acceleration of the general form : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the velocities of the material and magnetic field respectively , and the suffix @xmath77 refers to the velocity components perpendicular to the field lines .",
    "a version of this description has been successfully applied to a number of other intermediate polars by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to discs around young stars by @xcite and @xcite the magnetic acceleration in equation ( [ drag ] ) is intended to represent the dominant term of the magnetic interaction , with @xmath78 playing the role of a ` magnetic @xmath79 ' .",
    "the magnetic time - scale can be written in terms of @xmath78 as @xmath80 it is assumed that the magnetic field of the wd is dipolar and that it rotates as a solid body with the star .",
    "we refer to a system as a weak magnetic propeller when , in quiescence , the magnetic field is strong enough for the system to behave as a magnetic propeller , but not strong enough to eject a significant fraction of the transferred mass from the roche lobe of the primary ( as is the case in ae  aqr ) . during outburst",
    "the field should not be strong enough to prevent accretion .",
    "this requires the following hierarchy of time - scales : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath51 are the hot and cold viscous time - scales respectively .",
    "assuming the temperature of the quiescent disc to be @xmath83 k and @xmath84 , and that in outburst we have @xmath85 k and @xmath86 , equation ( [ tvisc ] ) gives @xmath87 a further condition for a system to act as a weak propeller is that the magnetic interaction takes place at radii exceeding the co - rotation radius @xmath88 , where the fieldlines rotate with the local ( circular ) kepler velocity . a spin period of @xmath89 for the wd in wz  sge gives @xmath90 cm , easily fulfilling this requirement .",
    "if , conversely , the interaction were to take place within @xmath91 then the effect of the magnetic field would be to enhance accretion .",
    "it now remains to quantify @xmath92 .",
    "there are a number of different models for the interaction of the inner disc and the white dwarf magnetosphere which have been applied to magnetic cvs . here",
    "we examine the two extreme cases in which the accretion disc is completely magnetized , and conversely , in which the disc is diamagnetic . in both cases",
    "we still assume that the stellar field has a dipolar geometry , and that any local field distortions may be treated as perturbations on this structure .",
    "when the magnetic field lines permeate the inner disc any vertical velocity shear tends to amplify the toroidal field component @xmath93 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "diffusive losses counteract this amplification and in steady state , these effects balance to give @xmath94 here @xmath95 is a parameter that accounts for the uncertainty in the vertical velocity shear and is of the order unity , @xmath96 represents an uncertainty in the diffusive loss time - scale , whilst @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the angular velocities of the wd and disc respectively .",
    "the tension in the field lines results in a magnetic acceleration which may be approximated by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the disc density , @xmath101 is the unit vector perpendicular to the field lines and @xmath102 is the radius of curvature of the field lines .",
    "it is possible to parametrize @xmath102 as + @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant of order unity . combining equations ( [ tor ] ) , ( [ rad ] ) and ( [ str ] ) , with @xmath105 , the magnetic acceleration is given by @xmath106 and @xmath92 by @xmath107 at the circularisation radius @xmath108 , the disc density is @xmath109 ( from equation ( [ sig ] ) , with @xmath105 ) . assuming @xmath110 we are able to constrain the magnetic moment @xmath111 using ( [ cons ] ) , giving @xmath112    for the opposite case of a diamagnetic flow we assume that the inner regions of the disc are broken up into a series of individual filaments , as predicated by the analysis of @xcite . in order to follow the evolution of the diamagnetic gas blobs ( which are formed well outside the co - rotation radius ) we follow the approach of @xcite",
    "this approach assumes that the diamagnetic blobs interact with the field via a surface drag force , characterized by the time - scale : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the alfvn speed in the medium surrounding the plasma , @xmath115 is the local magnetic field , @xmath116 is the plasma density , and @xmath117 is the typical length scale over which field lines are distorted . making the approximations that @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 we find that @xmath121      [ sec : res ] in this section we use a one - dimensional numerical model to confirm that it is feasible to create a depleted region in the centre of a quiescent accretion disc with a propeller .",
    "we also show that the propeller can lead to a build up of mass in the outer disc , and to extended recurrence times .",
    "the code outlined below is based on that used to similar effect in @xcite , but with the addition of viscosity switching to reproduce the effect of disc outbursts .",
    "a thin axisymmetric accretion disc is assumed to be rotating about a central mass @xmath122 .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are averaged over the azimuthal dimension so that non - axisymmetric effects , such as tidal forces from the secondary star , are not modelled .",
    "it is assumed that the disc is sufficiently cold that the dynamical time - scale @xmath123 is much smaller than the viscous or magnetic timescales so that a keplerian approximation can then be adopted for the azimuthal motion .",
    "the magnetic torque due to the rotating wd is added using a parametrization of the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 represents the universal constant of gravitation , @xmath122 is the mass of the central star and @xmath126 is the time - scale on which the local disc material gains angular momentum , which in this case is given by equation ( [ eqn : atime ] ) .",

    "the approach to viscosity switching adopted here is very similar to that used by @xcite in their smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "disc annuli are switched between high and low viscosity states , by altering the viscous @xmath79 parameter , using critical density ` triggers ' @xcite which lie at the extremes of the limit cycle .",
    "accordingly when the local surface density @xmath69 exceeds that of equation ( [ sig ] ) the local viscous parameter is altered smoothly on a thermal timescale ( @xmath130 ) to a value of @xmath131 .",
    "later , when @xmath69 falls below a lower trigger density , the viscous parameter is returned to its original value @xmath132 . in the high state",
    "the accretion disc should also be hotter , so the temperature @xmath133 is switched between @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the same way .",
    "the code calculates the diffusive and advective terms separately on a grid of resolution 500 and combines the results using operator splitting .",
    "the diffusive term is calculated using a forward in time space - centred scheme ( ftsc ) and the values of @xmath136 produced here are used as input for a modified two - step lax - wendroff scheme @xcite which is used to solve the advective term .",
    "the inner boundary , representing the stellar boundary layer , is placed at @xmath137 and an outflow condition such that @xmath138 is constant is applied .",

    "the white dwarf spin period is set to @xmath142 which gives a co - rotation radius of @xmath143 .",
    "calculations were performed without a primary magnetic field and with a field of @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) , although the precise value depends on the prescription adopted for the magnetic acceleration .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field was to truncate the inner disc , producing a depleted central region and to reduce the peak surface density .",
    "the inner disc is likely to be the starting point of any outburst in the non - magnetic case while in the magnetically truncated case this should instead occur close to the truncation radius .",
    "it is important that in neither case is the disc close to marginal stability , where the steady state profile would peak very close to @xmath146 .",
    "such marginal stability is another possible reason for long outburst times , but it would not cause an increase in outburst amplitude .    when the viscosity switching mechanism was enabled a series of outbursts occurred in both the magnetic and non - magnetic cases .",
    "these are plotted in fig [ fig : newcurve ] . in the non - magnetic case",
    "the outburst time is @xmath147 and the recurrence time is @xmath148 .",
    "this is roughly in agreement with observations of normal dn , although the outbursts are longer than expected .",
    "the outbursts vary in amplitude but are of the expected order of magnitude . in the magnetic case the recurrence time",
    "is increased by @xmath149 times to @xmath150 , and the outburst amplitude is increased by a factor of @xmath151 . in both cases the quiescent dissipation is more than two orders of magnitude less than the outburst dissipation .",
    "the profile of an individual magnetically moderated outburst is shown in fig [ fig : obprof ] .",
    "the outburst lasts for @xmath152 , notably shorter than is observed .",
    "it appears , after an initial sharp rise , to rise on a time - scale of a few days .",
    "this is close to the hot viscous timescale , rather than to the thermal time - scale .",
    "this is probably because once the disc becomes hot , on a thermal time - scale , mass migrates into the centre of the disc , filling the evacuated central regions on the viscous timescale .",
    "the outburst decays on a similar viscous time - scale , and then much more quickly , on the thermal time - scale , as the disc returns to the cool state .",
    "fig [ fig : massevolve ] shows how the mass of the accretion disc varied during outbursts .",
    "the total peak disc mass in the magnetic case was @xmath153 , twice that of the non - magnetic case .",
    "further , the mass consumed in the magnetic outbursts was @xmath154 , ten times that consumed in the non - magnetic outbursts , half of the total accretion disc mass , and approaching the value deduced from observations .",
    "we also note that the mass growth rate in the magnetic case is close to linear , this confirms that the disc is not close to marginal stability , as was discussed above .",
    "the results from the non - magnetic case show a series of alternate outbursts and mini - outbursts .",
    "mass accretion onto the white dwarf is plotted in fig [ fig : mdot ] , on the same time axis as fig [ fig : massevolve ] .",
    "the accretion rate peaks at @xmath155 in the magnetic case , which is a factor of @xmath156 more than the non - magnetic case .",
    "it is also notable that the cold viscous decay , which is not visible in fig [ fig : obprof ] , can be clearly seen in the magnetic case .    in fig",
    "[ fig : newevol ] the detailed evolution of a magnetically moderated outburst can be followed . during quiescence",
    "the propeller has prevented the disc from spreading in to the star , and by preventing accretion has forced a large build up of mass in the outer disc .",
    "the outburst begins when the surface density first exceeds the critical value , close to the truncation radius , rather than near the boundary layer in the usual way .",
    "heating waves then sweep inwards and outwards on a thermal time - scale until the whole disc is in the hot state .",
    "the viscosity of the disc is now higher , and the viscous timescale shorter , allowing mass to spread inwards and quench the propeller .",
    "the disc now takes a form close to the standard non - truncated shakura - sunyaev solution .",
    "mass accretion onto the white dwarf is high and the density of the disc drops rapidly until the lower trigger is reached at the outer edge of the disc . at this point a cooling wave sweeps inwards so that the disc becomes cool again and is gradually shifted outwards as the propeller is reestablished . around half of the total disc mass",
    "is consumed in the outburst .",
    "results from these calculations confirm that a magnetic propeller is capable of truncating the inner accretion disc and may also lead to an extended recurrence time .",
    "however the recurrence time is still an order of magnitude shorter than that observed with these simulation parameters .",
    "two possible mechanisms for further extending the recurrence time suggest themselves .",
    "the first requires only a slightly stronger magnetic field .",
    "if the magnetic field is stronger then the disc will be truncated at a larger radius , and this can be tuned so that the disc is very close to the steady state when it reaches the outburst trigger .",
    "as the disc approaches this steady state its growth rate slows asymptotically to zero so that the recurrence time in this case can be extremely long .",
    "this effect was discussed by @xcite .",
    "it is distinct from , and acts in addition to the mechanism described above which is concerned instead with the linear regime of disc growth .",
    "results from a calculation using this marginal stability effect are shown fig .",
    "[ fig : marginal ] . the recurrence time is increased to @xmath157 but neither the mass consumed nor the amplitude of the outbursts is greatly altered from the standard magnetic case illustrated in fig [ fig : newcurve ] , so that the marginal stability effect would be unable , in itself , to solve * ( smak 2)*. this mechanism also requires fine tuning ; if the field is slightly too strong outbursts will be prevented entirely .",
    "a second possible explanation for the further extension of the recurrence time , which does not require such fine tuning , is that the size of the mass reservoir may be further increased by tidal effects .",
    "the one - dimensional treatment detailed above precludes the consideration of binary tidal forces and resonances . to better model the structure of the accretion disc , including its non - axisymmetric modes , we turn to the complementary two - dimensional model described in section [ sec : threed ] .",
    "further numerical calculations were performed in two dimensions with smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the above prescription ( [ eqn : amag ] ) for the magnetic acceleration was implemented in an sph code and calculations were performed with and without a dipolar magnetic field in the plane of the accretion disc .",
    "the system parameters were similar those used in the one - dimensional simulations described above , although the mass transfer rate was @xmath158 .",
    "each calculation used around 40,000 particles with a fixed smoothing length .",
    "particles were injected at the first lagrangian point and removed when they approached the primary star .",
    "the resulting discs are shown in figs [ fig : disc ] and [ fig : discprofile3d ] , plotted as face - on disc views and radial profiles respectively .",
    "the profiles are somewhat different to those from the one - dimensional simulations , shown in fig [ fig : newevol ] , as a result of the torques from the binary potential .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field in pushing the disc outwards is more pronounced than in the one dimensional model . in the magnetic case , because matter is driven towards the resonant radii , the disc becomes eccentric and begins to develop some spiral structure .",
    "these are clearly seen as two peaks in the second plot of fig [ fig : discprofile3d ] .",
    "this structure also affects the time evolution of the surface density .",
    "fig [ fig : maggrownon ] shows how the peak surface density as a fraction of the critical surface density grows with time in the magnetic and non - magnetic cases .",
    "this can be viewed as a measure of how close the disc is to outburst , since when any substantial part of the disc reaches its local critical density an outburst will be triggered . in the non - magnetic case",
    "there is a simple monotonic growth of this parameter .",
    "the noise visible in the otherwise very smooth trend is caused by density enhancements associated with accretion events at the inner boundary , which may be a result of the limited resolution of the simulation .",
    "this monotonic growth is as expected from fig [ fig : discprofile3d ] which shows that the non - magnetic disc profile keeps the same form , with the density peak remaining at the same point around @xmath159 .",
    "if surface density continues to grow at this rate until outburst then this simulation represents around 3% of the duty cycle for a non - magnetic system . in the magnetic case",
    "the same parameter grows monotonically at first , much more slowly than in the non - magnetic case .",
    "its behaviour becomes stochastic once the disc is driven to become eccentric .",
    "it is problematic to extrapolate from such a short period to the length of the recurrence time , however the overall trend remains clear : the approach to outburst is _ clearly slower _ in the magnetic case .",
    "this result does not contradict that of [ sec : cod ] .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that effects due to the binary would prevent the propeller from leading to a long recurrence time .",
    "it also remains possible that the tidal forces could lead to the development of a much larger reservoir , and hence a longer recurrence time , than in the simple axisymmetric case .",
    "the weak magnetic propeller model for the outbursts of wz  sge results in a number of observationally testable predictions . the major consequence of the model , the existence of a substantial hole in the inner disc , has already been suggested by @xcite .",
    "the authors estimate the ratio of the inner and outer disc radii ( @xmath160 ) from observations of the h@xmath161 emission line widths .",
    "wz  sge was found to show an extremely large value of @xmath162 .",
    "this value agrees reasonably well with the second plot in fig [ fig : disc ] where @xmath163 and @xmath164 for the magnetic case , and is much larger than the value expected if the accretion disc extended all the way to the wd surface ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "the asynchronous magnetic cataclysmic variables ( the intermediate polars ) show multiple periodicities in their light curves .",
    "wz  sge has been observed to display oscillations at 27.87  s and 28.96  s as well as weaker oscillations at 28.2  s and 29.69  s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite interpret wz sge as an intermediate polar , and identify the 27.87  s oscillation as arising from the spinning white dwarf , and the other oscillations as beat periods between the white dwarf spin and material orbiting within the disc .",
    "the beat periods arise from the reprocessing of x - ray emission from the wd on the surface of the disc , the hotspot and/or the secondary star .",
    "assuming the material in the disc is moving in circular , keplerian orbits the radius associated with these beat periods @xmath166 can be written as @xmath167 where @xmath168 here @xmath169 is the keplerian period of the disc material , and @xmath170 is the observed beat period .",
    "assuming @xmath171 we find @xmath172 cm ( @xmath173 ) , @xmath174 cm ( @xmath175 ) , and @xmath176 cm ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "the radii @xmath178 and @xmath179 correlate reasonably well with material orbiting close to the inner edge of the quiescent disc in two - dimensional numerical models ( cf fig [ fig : disc ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath180 on the other hand , is quite close to the hotspot ( stream / disc impact region ) which should be located at @xmath181 , as seen in the magnetic cases in fig [ fig : disc ] .",
    "obtaining a closer fit between these radii and the model would require tighter constraints on the wd mass , and @xmath182 , as well a suitable model for the x - ray reprocessing within the disc .",
    "nonetheless absence of beat radii from the supposed evacuated region is encouraging for the magnetic propeller model .",
    "the fact that the oscillations are not observed during outburst is also entirely consistent with this model : the magnetosphere is compressed during outburst , and the system is observationally `` non - magnetic '' .",
    "the model outlined in this paper predicts that wz sge has an eccentric precessing disc , and it might therefore be expected to display permanent superhumps .",
    "the spin evolution of the white dwarf in wz sge is determined by angular momentum transfer in the quiescent and outburst phases . in quiescence",
    "the wd acts as a magnetic propeller , i.e. material approaching the wd is forced to larger radii .",
    "we can approximate this interaction by assuming the transferred gas , with initial specific angular momentum @xmath183 , is forced to orbit at a mean outer radius @xmath184 .",
    "the associated spin down torque on the wd is then @xmath185 where the mass transfer rate accross the l1 point @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and the parameter @xmath189 if material at @xmath184 loses angular momentum to the secondary star via tides ( this will be expected to occur once the outer edge of the disc reaches the tidal radius ) .",
    "conversely , in outburst , the wd gains angular momentum with accreted matter at the rate @xmath190 where we adopt an inner disc radius of @xmath191 . from the results of @xcite the average accretion rate during outburst",
    "can be estimated as @xmath192 .",
    "+ the evolution time - scale of the white dwarf spin period can be written in terms of @xmath193 as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the moment of inertia of the wd .",
    "averaging over a duty cycle the torque on the wd is given by @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the outburst duration and we take @xmath198 . from the estimates above ( assuming @xmath199 ) we find @xmath200 .",
    "the greater spin - up torque gives a spin up on the time - scale @xmath201 the wd in a weak propeller may experience a net spin up , as above , or a net spin down , if outbursts are shorter or the mass transfer rate is higher for example .",
    "both these results may lead to a spin up / spin down cycle . + * net spin up : * in this case , illustrated by wz  sge , the net spin evolution is towards shorter periods .",
    "therefore , according to equation ( [ drag ] ) the propeller will become stronger with time .",
    "the condition @xmath202 will eventually be satisfied .",
    "at this point accretion will be prevented completely and outbursts will cease ; the system will become ae  aqr like . this phase should be short lived however and it must lead to a spin down .",
    "therefore a cycle between wz  sge and ae  aqr type stars may arise . +",
    "* net spin down : * in this opposite case , the net evolution is towards longer white dwarf spin periods .",
    "the propeller becomes weaker with time until it is eventually quenched when @xmath203 .",
    "the system would then look like a normal su  uma star .",
    "this su  uma phase would usually result in white dwarf spin up .",
    "therefore an alternative cycle may exist between wz  sge and su  uma type systems .",
    "both of these cycles are a natural consequence of hierarchy ( [ eqn : hier ] ) .",
    "we have argued that the outbursts of wz sge can be explained using the standard dim value for @xmath7 if we assume that the white dwarf in the system acts as a magnetic propeller .",
    "numerical models of the magnetic disc , in both one and two dimensions , predict an increased inter - outburst time @xmath71 , and a disc massive enough to fuel an increased outburst accretion rate .",
    "no episode of enhanced mass transfer from the secondary star is required to trigger outbursts , or to supply mass during outburst .",
    "the weak - propeller models assume that the magnetic tension force is the dominant cause of angular momentum transfer in the quiescent disc , and that the force is proportional to the local shear between the disc plasma and the magnetic field . in outburst",
    "angular momentum transfer is dominated by viscous diffusion , and mass accretion on to the white dwarf is permitted .",
    "this results in an estimated wd magnetic moment in the range @xmath204 if the disc is assumed to be fully magnetized , or a value in the range @xmath205 if the disc is assumed to be diamagnetic .",
    "these values for the wd magnetic moment would suggest that wz  sge is a short period equivalent of the intermediate polars ( ips ) .",
    "most ips lie above period gap ( @xmath206 ) and have magnetic moments in the range @xmath207 .",
    "@xcite pointed out the only two confirmed ips with @xmath208 hours ( ex  hya and rx1238 - 38 ) have @xmath209 g @xmath210 and long spin periods ( 67 min and 36 min respectively ) .",
    "wz  sge would therefore be the first weakly magnetic @xmath211 cv to be found below the period gap .    in differentiating between the models of the disc - magnetosphere interaction",
    "it is useful to consider the case of ae  aquarii .",
    "this system is thought to contain a wd with a magnetic moment @xmath212 , which ejects @xmath213 99% of the mass transfer stream from the system @xcite .",
    "if the wd magnetic moment @xmath214 in wz  sge then it would satisfy the criteria necessary to become an ejector system .",
    "hence in the case a fully magnetized disc , it would seem that the presence of the disc itself is the only protection the system has from ejecting the transferred mass .",
    "if the disc was completely accreted or destroyed for any reason wz  sge would resemble a short period version of ae  aqr .",
    "this would not apply to the case where the wd has a magnetic moment in the range predicted by the diamagnetic model .    a wd spin evolution cycle results as a natural consequence of the time - scale hierarchy ( [ eqn : hier ] ) .",
    "in the case of wz  sge we expect the spin cycle to run between the current state , characterised by long inter - outburst times , and that of an ae  aqr - like strong propeller . in some similar systems however , spin - up phases would look like a normal su  uma system , whilst the spin down phases would be wz  sge like .",
    "wz  sge - like systems following such spin cycles are expected to be relatively rare because of the constraint ( [ eqn : hier ] ) , which results in the restricted range of allowed wd magnetic moments presented above .",
    "@xcite find evidence for ring - like accretion discs in long supercycle length su  uma stars from a radial velocity study of the @xmath215 emission lines of these systems .",
    "wz  sge is the most extreme of these objects with a recurrence time of @xmath216 and @xmath217 , which is in good agreement with our numerical results .",
    "other su  umas show a strong positive correlation between supercycle times and the @xmath63 parameter .",
    "this result is in agreement with the model presented in this paper for wz  sge .",
    "the wds in the other , less extreme , su  uma stars would simply act as less efficient propellers : the wds would have weaker magnetic moments , or lower spin rates ( which may reflect various stages of the spin up / down cycles postulated above ) .",
    "strong candidates for wz  sge - like systems are rz  leo ( @xmath218 4259 days , @xmath219 ) , cu  vel ( @xmath220 700 - 900 days , @xmath221 ) and wx  cet ( @xmath220 1000 days , @xmath222 ) , ( taken from * ? ? ?",
