    "agent - based models have attracted significant interest across a broad range of disciplines @xcite .",
    "an increasingly popular application of these models has been the study of financial markets @xcite .",
    "the motivations for this focus on financial markets are two - fold : the promise that data - rich financial markets are good candidates for the empirical study of complex systems , and the inadequacy of standard economic models based on the notions of equilibria and rational expectations .",
    "currently many different agent - based models exist in the econophysics literature , each with its own set of implicit assumptions and interesting properties @xcite . in general",
    "these models manage to exhibit some of the statistical properties that are reminiscent of those observed in real - world financial markets ; for example , fat - tailed distributions of returns and long - timescale volatility correlations .  despite their differences , these models draw on several of the same key ideas : feedback , frustration , adaptability and evolution .",
    "the underlying goal of all this research effort is to generate a microscopic agent - based model which ( i ) reproduces all the stylized facts of a financial market , _ and _ ( ii ) makes sense on the microscopic level in terms of financial market microstructure . while each of these goals is separately achievable , the combination of ( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) within a single model represents a fascinating challenge , and underpins our motivation for writing the present paper .    challet and zhang s minority game @xcite offers possibly the simplest paradigm for a system containing the key features of feedback , frustration and adaptability .",
    "the mg has remarkably rich dynamics , given the simplicity of its underlying binary structure , and has potential applications in a wide range of fields .",
    "consequently challet and zhang s mg model , together with the original bar model of arthur @xcite , represent a major milestone in the study of complex systems .",
    "given the mg s richness and yet underlying simplicity , the mg has also received much attention as a financial market model @xcite .",
    "the mg comprises an odd number of agents _ n _ choosing repeatedly between the options of buying ( 1 ) and selling ( 0 ) a quantity of a risky asset .",
    "the agents continually strive to make the minority decision i.e. buy assets when everyone else is selling and sell when everyone else is buying .",
    "this strategy seems to make sense on first inspection . for example",
    ", a majority of agents selling will force the price of the asset down and thus ensure a low buy price ( which is favorable ) for the minority of the agents who decided to buy ; hence the minority group has ` won ' .",
    "however , now consider the scenario where this pattern repeats over and over .",
    "the minority of agents , who have been buying more and more assets as the price falls , now find themselves holding a huge inventory of assets which are worth very little .",
    "when these agents try to cash in their assets , they will find themselves very much poorer .",
    "_ surely then the minority group has actually lost ? _",
    "this paradox has sparked much discussion as to the suitability of the mg as the basis of a microscopic model of financial markets .",
    "consequently a diverse range of modified ( yet mg - related ) models have emerged , all seeking to address this point in different ways @xcite .",
    "some models include a combination of different types of agents - in particular , agents who are rewarded for trading in the minority , and agents who are rewarded oppositely for trading in the majority ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an early example ) . in such models ,",
    "the overall class of the game ( minority or majority ) is ambiguous , and is likely to change as differing numbers of each group flood in and out of the market .",
    "other models try to combine the two different reward structures , thus requiring only one class of agents who strive to be neither exclusively in the minority group nor exclusively in the majority group @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the econophysics website @xcite for further examples ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the purpose of this paper is to consolidate the search for a suitable microscopic reward scheme for use in agent - based financial markets .",
    "the paper comprises a synthesis of several earlier reports , each aimed at addressing the topic of self - consistent agent - based market modelling within a binary game structure .",
    "these earlier reports are re - organized in light of several recent papers on specific reward structures , and supplemented by additional simulation results , observations and thoughts @xcite .",
    "we start by discussing various strategy reward schemes in which the agents seek to maximize their wealth in a direct way .",
    "we then illustrate a disturbing feature whereby such reward structures , while appearing microscopically acceptable , can lead to unrealistic market dynamics ( e.g. instabilities ) .",
    "finally , we discuss various mechanisms which are responsible for re - stabilizing the market in reality .",
    "this discussion leads to a ` toolbox ' of processes from which , we believe , successful market models can be constructed in the future .",
    "consider the situation of a population of @xmath0 agents with some limited global resource .",
    "a specific example could be arthur s famous bar problem @xcite where there are @xmath0 regular bar - goers but only @xmath1 seats . the reward scheme in arthur",
    "s bar problem is simple : bar - goers are successful if they attend _ and _ they manage to obtain a seat .",
    "this reward scheme implicitly assumes that the bar - goers value sitting down above other criteria . while this makes sense for many situations , it is not universal . for example",
    ", it is our experience that customers of college - based bars do not view seating as a necessary requirement for a successful evening !",
    "the motto ` the more the merrier ' often seems more appropriate .",
    "the mg represents a very special case of the bar problem , in which the seating capacity @xmath2 _ and _ all the attendees wish to sit down . in more general and realistic situations ,",
    "the correct reward scheme is likely to be less simple than either arthur s bar model or challet and zhang s mg .",
    "until a specific reward scheme is defined , the bar model remains ill - specified .",
    "putting this another way , the precise reward scheme chosen is a fundamental property of the resulting system and directly determines the resulting dynamical evolution .",
    "hence it is crucial to understand the effect that different microscopic reward schemes have on the macroscopic market dynamics .    as first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bar problem is somewhat analogous to a financial market where the bar - goers are replaced by traders . in the same way that a general bar problem requires a non - trivial reward scheme , any ` correct ' agent - based market model will need a non - trivial reward scheme in order to avoid inconsistencies with financial market microstructure .",
    "this provides us with the motivation to look beyond the bar model and mg , in order to design an agent - based model with financial relevance .",
    "having said this , the binary structure of the mg provides an appealing framework for formulating a market model without introducing too many obvious pathologies .",
    "given these considerations , our discussion from here on will not assume any specific reward scheme , but will employ a binary game structure based on ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start by reviewing the binary game structure .",
    "there are three basic parameters ; the number of agents @xmath0 , the ` memory ' of the agents @xmath3 , the number of strategies held by each agent @xmath4 .",
    "the agents all observe a common binary source of information , but only remember the previous @xmath3 bits .",
    "hence the global information available to each agent at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath6   $ ] where in decimal notation @xmath6 \\in\\left\\ {   0\\ldots p-1\\right\\ }   $ ] with @xmath7 .",
    "each strategy @xmath8 contains as its elements @xmath9 , and represents a response @xmath10 to each of the possible @xmath11 values of the global information @xmath12 .",
    "there are hence @xmath13 possible strategies .",
    "the agents are randomly allocated a subset of @xmath4 of these strategies at the outset of the game , and are not allowed to replace these .",
    "the agents also keep a score @xmath14 reflecting their strategies previous successes , whether the strategy is played or not .",
    "the net action of the agents @xmath15   $ ] is defined as : @xmath16   = \\sum_{r=1}^{2^{p}}n_{r}\\left [   t\\right ]   a_{r}^{\\mu\\left [ t\\right ]   } % \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the number of agents playing strategy @xmath18 .",
    "the agents always play their highest performing strategy , i.e. the strategy with the highest @xmath14 . the strategy score is updated with payoff @xmath19 such that @xmath20   = s_{r}\\left [   t\\right ]   + g_{r}\\left [   t+1\\right ]   $ ] .",
    "the central question is the following : what should we take as ` success ' in the context of a market and hence what are the payoffs ? in short , what is the microscopic reward scheme ?",
    "this is equivalent to asking what the game actually is , since a game requires a definition of the players goals and hence their rewards . in order to address this question ,",
    "we start by considering a binary version of arthur s bar problem with general @xmath21 , i.e. an mg - like model which is generalized to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the two responses would be ` attend ' or ` do nt attend ' , and there are two possible scenarios : ( i ) the attendance is less than the seating capacity . in this case , the attendees are successful while those who did nt attend are unsuccessful .",
    "( ii ) the attendance exceeds the seating capacity . in this case , the attendees are unsuccessful while those who did nt attend are successful . setting @xmath2 yields the mg , and the two scenarios collapse into one : the successful agents are those who predict the minority group , i.e. attend when the minority attend , or do nt attend when the majority attend .",
    "[ for a study of the binary game with @xmath22 , see ref . @xcite .",
    "] in the specific case of the mg , success is classified as having correctly predicted the minority outcome .",
    "the payoff function for the mg is thus of the form : @xmath23   = \\chi\\left [   -a_{r}^{\\mu\\left [   t\\right ]   } a\\left [ t\\right ]   \\right ]   \\label{eq strat payoff mg}%\\ ] ] where @xmath24   $ ] is an odd , increasing function of @xmath25 usually chosen to be either @xmath24   = x$ ] or @xmath24 = \\operatorname*{sgn}\\left [   x\\right ]   $ ] .",
    "the feedback in the mg arises through the global information @xmath6   $ ] where the most recent bit of the binary information is defined by the sign of the net action of the agents @xmath15   $ ] : @xmath26   = 2\\mu\\left [   t\\right ]   -p\\operatorname{h}\\left [ \\mu\\left [   t\\right ]   -\\frac{p}{2}\\right ]   + \\operatorname{h}\\left [   a\\left [ t\\right ]   \\right ]   \\label{eq history update mg}%\\ ] ] where @xmath27   $ ] is the heaviside function @xcite . in the more general form of the game where the resource level @xmath22 , the argument in the heaviside function @xmath28   $ ] would depend on the value of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "more generally it could become a complicated function of all the game parameters , or include feedback from the macroscopic dynamics in the past , or even the effects of exogenous news arrival .",
    "it is now accepted that a generalization of the mg in which agents can sit out of the game ( i.e. @xmath29   } = 0 $ ] ) when they are not confident of the success of any of their @xmath4 strategies , provides a better model of financial trading since it allows the number of agents active in the market to vary .",
    "this more general model is the grand canonical minority game ( gcmg ) which was first studied in ref .",
    "the gcmg typically has two more parameters than the mg : namely @xmath30 which is a time horizon over which strategy scores are forgotten ( i.e. @xmath20   = \\left ( 1 - 1/t\\right )   s_{r}\\left [   t\\right ]   + g_{r}\\left [   t+1\\right ]   $ ] ) and @xmath31 which is a threshold value of @xmath14 below which the agents will opt not to participate in the game ( @xmath29   } = 0 $ ] ) .",
    "the gcmg seems to reproduce the stylized statistical features of a financial time - series over a wide parameter range ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "it is commonly believed that in a financial market , excess demand ( i.e. the difference between the number of assets offered and the number sought by the agents ) exerts a force on the price of the asset .",
    "furthermore it is believed that a positive excess demand will force the price up and a negative demand will force the price down . a reasonable suggestion for the price formation process",
    "could then be @xcite : @xmath32   \\right ]   -\\ln\\left [   p\\left [   t-1\\right ] \\right ]   = \\frac{d\\left [   t^{-}\\right ]   } { \\lambda}% \\label{eq price formation mult}%\\ ] ]    or @xmath33   -p\\left [   t-1\\right ]   = \\frac{d\\left [   t^{-}\\right ] } { \\lambda}\\label{eq price formation add}%\\ ] ] where @xmath34   $ ] represents the excess demand in the market prior to time @xmath5 , when the new price @xmath35   $ ] is set and the buy / sell orders are executed .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath36 represents the ` market depth ' ( or liquidity ) i.e. how sensitive a market is to an order imbalance . in general",
    "we would expect @xmath36 to be some increasing function of the number of traders @xmath0 trading in that asset .",
    "also , the functional forms may not be linear as in equations [ eq price formation mult ] and [ eq price formation add ] .",
    "however , studies carried out on several markets have found the forms of equations [ eq price formation mult ] and [ eq price formation add ] to be reasonable @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we suggested that in markets involving a market - maker who takes up the imbalance of orders between buyers and sellers , the market - maker will wish to manipulate the price of the asset in order to minimize her inventory of stock @xmath37   $ ] . whilst the market - maker s job is to execute as many of the orders as is possible",
    ", she does not wish to accumulate a high position in either direction . to this end ,",
    "the market - maker lowers the price to attract buyers when she holds a long position @xmath38 and raises it to attract profit - taking sellers when she has a short position @xmath39 .",
    "this modifies the price formation of equation [ eq price formation mult ] to : @xmath40   \\right ]   -\\ln\\left [   p\\left [   t-1\\right ] \\right ]   = \\frac{d\\left [   t^{-}\\right ]   } { \\lambda}-\\frac{\\phi_{m}\\left [ t^{-}\\right ]   } { \\lambda_{m}}\\label{eq price formation mult mm}%\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the market - maker s sensitivity to her inventory .",
    "our puzzle is to form a sensible model of a collection of traders buying and selling a financial asset .",
    "it is clear from sections [ sec mg basics ] and [ sec price process ] that we have two pieces of the puzzle .",
    "the mg gave us a simple paradigm for a group of agents interacting in response to global information and adapting their behavior based on past experience .",
    "the output of this model was a ` net action ' @xmath15   $ ] .",
    "in addition , we now have some simple systems for price - formation based on an excess demand @xmath42   $ ] .",
    "but what relationship should we assume between @xmath42   $ ] and @xmath15   $ ] ? to answer this question , we should clarify what we want the individual actions @xmath43   } $ ] of the strategies to resemble .",
    "in short , the question is ` what does a strategy map from and to ? '    in most studies of the mg as a market model , researchers have taken the actions @xmath44   } \\in\\left\\ {   -1,1\\right\\ }   $ ] to be the actions of selling and buying a quanta of the asset respectively .",
    "thus the net action of all agents @xmath15   $ ] naturally becomes the excess demand , i.e. we have : @xmath45   = a\\left [   t-1\\right ]   \\label{eq demand mg}%\\ ] ] given this and the fact that the price change is an increasing function of excess demand ( for equations [ eq price formation mult ] and [ eq price formation add ] ) , the global information becomes the directions ( up or down ) of the previous price changes .",
    "so the answer here is that a strategy maps from the history of past asset price movements to a buy / sell signal .",
    "a strategy mapping _ from _ the history of past asset price movements seems a natural and sensible choice , since financial chartists do look at precisely this information to decide upon a course of action .",
    "we therefore propose that in general , for this class of market model , we should always use the following equation ( eq . [ eq history update gen ] ) to update the global information , irrespective of whether equation [ eq demand mg ] holds .",
    "@xmath26   = 2\\mu\\left [   t\\right ]   -p\\operatorname{h}\\left [ \\mu\\left [   t\\right ]   -\\frac{p}{2}\\right ]   + \\operatorname{h}\\left [   \\delta p\\left [   t+1,t\\right ]   \\right ]   \\label{eq history update gen}%\\ ] ]    it is worth now spending a few moments considering the timings in this model . equation [ eq demand mg ] is for the excess demand at time @xmath46 , i.e. prior to time @xmath5 when all the orders are processed and a new price @xmath47   $ ] is formed .",
    "thus @xmath34   $ ] can only result from all the information that is available at time @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50   \\right\\ }   $ ] . from this information ,",
    "the agents take actions @xmath51   } $ ] producing a net action of @xmath52   $ ] .",
    "the agents actions ( orders ) however do not get realized ( executed ) until time @xmath5 when the new price @xmath35   $ ] is known .",
    "the mg payoff function of equation [ eq strat payoff mg ] , hence rewards agents positively for deciding to sell ( buy ) assets ( i.e. @xmath51   } = -1 $ ] @xmath53 ) when the order execution price @xmath35   $ ] is above ( below ) the price level at the time they made the decision ( i.e. @xmath54   $ ] ) .",
    "why is this mechanism of moving in the minority a physically reasonable ambition for the agents ?",
    "let us consider the ` notional ' wealth of an agent @xmath55 to be given by : @xmath56   = \\phi_{i}\\left [   t\\right ]   p\\left [   t\\right ] + c_{i}\\label{eq agent wealth}%\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the number of assets held and @xmath58 is the amount of cash held .",
    "it is clear from equation [ eq agent wealth ] that an exchange of cash for asset at any price does not in any way affect the agents notional wealth .",
    "however , the point is in the terminology .",
    "the wealth @xmath59   $ ] is only _",
    "notional _ and not real in any sense - the only real measure of wealth is @xmath58 which is the amount of capital the agent has available to spend .",
    "thus it is evident that an agent has to do a ` round trip ' ( i.e. buy ( sell ) an asset then sell ( buy ) it back ) to discover whether a _ real _ profit has been made .",
    "let us consider two examples of such a round trip .",
    "in the first case the agent trades in the minority while in the second he trades in the majority :    * moving in minority : + [ c]|l|l|l|l|l|l|@xmath5 & action @xmath60   $ ] & @xmath61   $ ] & @xmath62   $ ] & @xmath35   $ ] & @xmath63 $ ] + 1 & submit buy order & 100 & 0 & 10 & 100 + 2 & buy ... , submit sell order & 91 & 1 & 9 & 100 + 3 & sell & 101 & 0 & 10 & 101 + * moving in majority : + [ c]|l|l|l|l|l|l|@xmath5 & action @xmath60   $ ] & @xmath61   $ ] & @xmath62   $ ] & @xmath35   $ ] & @xmath63 $ ] + 1 & submit buy order & 100 & 0 & 10 & 100 + 2 & buy ... , submit sell order & 89 & 1 & 11 & 100 + 3 & sell & 99 & 0 & 10 & 99 +    as can be seen , moving in the minority creates wealth for the agent upon completion of the necessary round - trip , whereas moving in the majority loses wealth .",
    "however if the agent had held the asset for any length of time between buying it and selling it back , his wealth would also depend on the rise and fall of the asset price over the holding period .",
    "thus the mg mechanism seems perfectly reasonable for a collection of traders who simply buy / sell on one timestep and sell / buy back on the next , but this is not of course what real financial traders do in general .",
    "this pinpoints the main criticism of the mg as a market model .",
    "the minority mechanism at play in the mg , arises solely from equation [ eq strat payoff mg ] for the payoff ( reward ) @xmath64   $ ] given to each strategy @xmath18 based on its action @xmath44   } $ ] .",
    "thus it can be trivially conjectured that changing the structure of the payoff function will change the class of game being played . in section [",
    "sec mg to mm ]  we pointed out that although _ trading _ in the minority was beneficial , the minority payoff structure itself made no allowance for the rise or fall in the value of the agent s portfolio @xmath57 of assets .",
    "let us try to rectify this by examining the form of the agent s notional wealth , equation [ eq agent wealth ] .",
    "if we differentiate the notional wealth , we get an expression for @xmath65   = w_{i}\\left [ t+1\\right ]   -w_{i}\\left [   t\\right ]   $ ] given by : @xmath66   = \\delta c_{i}\\left [   t+1,t\\right ]   + p\\left [ t+1\\right ]   \\delta\\phi_{i}\\left [   t+1,t\\right ]   + \\phi_{i}\\left [   t\\right ] \\delta p\\left [   t+1,t\\right]\\ ] ] the first two terms cancel because the amount of cash lost @xmath67   $ ] is used to buy the extra @xmath68   $ ] assets at price @xmath69   $ ] .",
    "this leaves us with : @xmath66   = \\phi_{i}\\left [   t\\right ]   \\delta p\\left [ t+1,t\\right ] \\label{eq agent wealth chng}%\\ ] ] we can then use equation [ eq agent wealth chng ] to work out an appropriate reward @xmath64   $ ] for each strategy based on whether its action @xmath44   } $ ] induced a positive or negative increase in notional wealth .",
    "let us first use the fact that the price change @xmath70   $ ] is roughly proportional to the excess demand @xmath71   $ ] : this can be seen explicitly from our earlier equation for the price formation , equation [ eq price formation add ] .",
    "then let s use our mg interpretation of the net action @xmath72   $ ] , equation [ eq demand mg ] .",
    "we thus have from equation [ eq agent wealth chng ] : @xmath73    &   \\varpropto\\phi_{r}\\left [   t\\right ]",
    "d\\left [   \\left (   t+1\\right )   ^{-}\\right ] \\\\ &   \\varpropto\\phi_{r}\\left [   t\\right ]   a\\left [   t\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then identify the accumulated position of a strategy at time @xmath5 , @xmath74   $ ] , to be the sum of all the actions ( orders ) made by that strategy which have been executed within times @xmath75 . remembering that at time @xmath5 , the action ( order ) @xmath44   } $ ] has _ not _ yet been executed ( it gets executed at @xmath76 ) , this gives @xmath74   = \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}a_{r}^{\\mu\\left [   i\\right ]   }",
    "let us then set the payoff given to a strategy @xmath64   $ ] , to be an increasing ( odd ) function @xmath77 of the notional wealth increase @xmath78   $ ] for that strategy .",
    "we thus arrive at : @xmath23   = \\chi\\left [   \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}a_{r}^{\\mu\\left [ i\\right ]   } \\times a\\left [   t\\right ]   \\right ] \\label{eq strat payoff nwealth}%\\ ] ] we could also propose a locally - weighted equivalent of equation [ eq strat payoff nwealth ] , in which the reward given to a strategy is more heavily weighted on the result of its recent actions than the actions it made further in the past .",
    "this gives @xmath23   = \\chi\\left [   \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}\\left (   1 - 1/t\\right ) ^{t-1-i}a_{r}^{\\mu\\left [   i\\right ]   } \\times a\\left [   t\\right ]   \\right ] \\label{eq strat payoff nwealth t}%\\ ] ] where @xmath30 enumerates a characteristic time - scale over which the position accumulated by the strategy is ` forgotten ' .",
    "the @xmath79 limit of equation [ eq strat payoff nwealth t ] yields @xmath64   = \\chi\\left [ a_{r}^{\\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   } a\\left [   t\\right ]   \\right ]   $ ] , i.e. only the position resulting from the most recently executed trade is taken into account . with @xmath79 ,",
    "this payoff structure essentially rewards a strategy at time @xmath76 based on whether the notional wealth change @xmath80   $ ] was _ more positive _ than it would have been if action @xmath81   } $ ]  had _ not _ been taken .",
    "if equation [ eq strat payoff nwealth t ] is used in an agent - based market model , the agents play the strategy they hold which has accumulated the highest ` virtual ' notional wealth .",
    "we mean ` virtual ' in the sense that the strategy itself will not have _ actually _ accumulated this notional wealth unless it has been played without fail since time @xmath82 .",
    "the agents in this model are thus all striving to increase their notional wealth and are allowed to do so by taking arbitrarily large positions @xmath57 .",
    "* we will call this incarnation of the market model $ g[eq strat payoff nwealth t ] * : the term ` $ g ' is named after the ` the $ -game ' of ref .",
    "@xcite where agents also strive to maximize notional wealth , and ` [ eq strat payoff nwealth t ] ' is named after equation [ eq strat payoff nwealth t ] for the strategy payoff .",
    "we stress that this incarnation of the market model is by no means unique . for example",
    ", it may be more appropriate to consider a model wherein each agent is only allowed one position in the asset at any time , i.e. @xmath83   = -1,0,1 $ ] .",
    "this amounts to us redefining the strategies @xmath18 as mapping to the actions ` go long / short ' instead of ` buy / sell ' , i.e. @xmath44   } = \\phi_{r}\\left [   \\left ( t+1\\right )   ^{-}\\right ]   $ ] . note the reference to @xmath84 here because the action @xmath44   } $ ] is not executed until time @xmath76 : after this time @xmath44   } = \\phi_{r}\\left [ \\left (   t+1\\right )   \\right ]   .$ ] in this new model , the net action of the agents @xmath15   $ ] therefore represents the overall desired position of the population at time @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath15 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\phi_{i}\\left [   \\left (   t+1\\right )   ^{-}\\right ]   $ ] .",

    "in the previous section , we introduced different microscopic reward schemes for use in binary multi - agent market models .",
    "the aim of these new strategy payoff structures , was to get the agents to maximize their notional wealth as given by equation [ eq agent wealth ] .",

    "we can include the effect of limited agent resources in our market model by allocating agent @xmath108 an initial capital @xmath126   $ ] ( and position @xmath127   $ ] ) and then updating this capital using @xmath61   = c_{i}\\left [   t-1\\right ] -\\delta\\phi_{i}\\left [   t , t-1\\right ]   p\\left [   t\\right ]   $ ] @xcite .",

    "this is due to the high degree of anti - persistence in the system as was seen in the $ g[eq strat payoff nwealth t ] model .",
    "the large spread in the results arises from the tendency of the model to exhibit clustering of activity states : persistence follows persistence and anti - persistence follows antipersistence as described in section [ sec mm behavior ] .",
    "[ ptb ]    figure2.eps    we note that in the work of giardina and bouchaud ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) the strategy payoff function has the same basic form as eq .",
    "[ eq strat payoff posnwealth ] , i.e. it is a $ g[eq strat payoff posnwealth]w - style model .",

    "we expect this to dramatically affect the dynamical properties of the system as the mechanism for agent coordination and thus crowd formation has been altered .",
    "the interesting dynamical behavior of market models based on the binary strategy approach of the mg , arises largely as a consequence of the heterogeneity in the strategies held by the agents and the common perception of a strategy s success .",
    "the extent to which agents will agree on the best course of action , and the consequent crowding , is solely a function of how the @xmath13 available strategies are distributed amongst the population of agents . if the way in which the strategies are initially allocated is biased , then the resulting dynamics will reflect this @xcite .",
    "the introduction of an agent wealth , as discussed in the previous subsection , also brings about diversity in the market model .",
    "even if we initiate the model with all agents having an equal allocation of wealth in the form of cash plus assets , the wealths of the agents @xmath137 will soon become heterogenous as a direct result of their heterogenous strategies .",

    "[ ptb ]    figure3.eps    the heterogeneity of agents wealth in the $ g[eq strat payoff nwealth t]w model is fed back into the system through the buying power of the agents alone . however , although wealthier agents have the potential to buy and sell more assets , they still only trade in single quanta of the asset at any given timestep , the same as poorer agents .",
    "it may be more reasonable to propose that the agents trade in sizes proportional to their resources @xcite , i.e. @xmath128    &   = \\gamma\\frac{c_{i}\\left [   t-1\\right ] } { p\\left [   t-1\\right ]   } \\text { \\ \\ for \\ \\ } a_{r_{i}^{\\ast}}^{\\mu\\left [ t-1\\right ]   } = 1\\\\ \\delta\\phi_{i}\\left [   t , t-1\\right ]    &   = \\gamma\\phi_{i}\\left [   t-1\\right ] \\text { \\ \\ for \\ \\ } a_{r_{i}^{\\ast}}^{\\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   } = -1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the highest scoring strategy @xmath18 of agent @xmath108 .",

    ", assets will generally need to be divisible , i.e. the sense of agents buying and selling a quanta of the asset as in $ g[eq strat payoff nwealth t]w is lost .",
    "this in turn means that instead of the degree of trending being controlled by the level of initial resource allocation @xmath130 , it is instead determined by @xmath140 , since this effectively determines the number of trades agents can make in any trending period before hitting the boundary of their capital resources .",
    "also with this system of trading in proportion to wealth , trends will start steep and end shallow as agents run out of resources and thus make smaller and smaller trades .",
    "apart from these stylized differences , the system has a very similar dynamical behavior to the more straight - forward $ g[eq strat payoff nwealth t]w model .",
    "diversity in strategies and wealth are the two big sources of agent heterogeneity that we have covered so far .",
    "this agent heterogeneity has led to a market model with dynamical behavior which is interesting and diverse over a large parameter range .",
    "however , the typical price / volume output only starts to become representative of a real financial market at higher @xmath3 , as can be seen in figure [ fig dolgw price vol ] . as discussed in section [ sec mm behavior ] , the high @xmath3 regime represents a ` dilute ' market where very few traders act in a coordinated fashion",
    ". however one would expect that a real financial market is _ not _ in a dilute phase at all , since it _ does _ have large groups of agents forming crowds which rush to the market together , thereby creating the bursty activity pattern observed empirically .",

    "so far this section has discussed how instabilities and inefficiencies in the model market ( as indicated by repeating , un - arbitraged patterns ) could be remedied by inclusion of more realistic , sophisticated and diverse strategic agents .",
    "however the agents we have considered have all acted in the same fashion , i.e. with the goal of maximizing their wealth by employing a strategic methodology based on the observable endogenous market indicators . in terms of a real financial market",
    ", we have considered modelling the subset of agents who consider the past history of asset price movements as the only relevant information .",
    "although in reality we expect this subset to be large , we certainly acknowledge the presence of agents who strategically use other endogenous market indicators such as volume as a source of global information .",
    "the strategic use of other endogenous market indicators simply gives a more sophisticated model within the same basic framework .",
    "what we have so far neglected to include is the presence of agents using exogenous information to influence their trading decisions .",
    "possible sources of exogenous information are as vast as human imagination itself : they could for example range from economic indicators through to company reports and rumor , or even ` gut - feeling ' and astrology ! within the context of our model framework , strategies employed based on these external sources of information are un - strategic with respect to the endogenous information , and as such represent a stochastic influence .",
    "such stochasticity , representing the response of agents to exogenous information , can be incorporated into the models in a variety of ways .",
    "for example a background level of stochastic action could be assumed at each timestep , or be made to appear as a poisson process with a given mean frequency .",
    "however , it seems most physically satisfying to incorporate stochastic action in the form of an extra pair of strategies for each ( or at least some ) agent : one buy strategy , @xmath190 , and one sell strategy , @xmath191 .",
    "agents could then be given a probability of using each of these strategies in place of their ` usual ' chartist strategies .",
    "furthermore , the probabilities of using these strategies could be allowed to evolve .",
    "this system of modelling response to an exogenous signal is essentially the ` genetic game ' of ref .",
    "alternatively , the probability of using one of these strategies representing the response to an exogenous signal , could be based on an endogenous market indicator .",
    "an example of this is the mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite of switching to ` fundamentalist behavior ' . in the model of ref .",

    "more generally , we suspect that among the agent - based market models in the literature which manage to reproduce stylized facts , the inclusion of some level of stochasticity within the model is crucial for helping to break up unphysical dynamics and hence achieve market - like behavior .",
    "in the framework of the mg , each strategy @xmath8 comprises the elements @xmath9 which represent a response @xmath10 to each of the possible @xmath11 values of the global information @xmath12 ( see section [ sec mg basics ] ) . in section [ sec mg to mm ] , we identified the different states of the global information @xmath12 as corresponding to different patterns in the past history of asset price movements ( binary : up / down ) .",
    "we can therefore think of a strategy as a book of chartist principles recommending an action for each and every possible pattern of length @xmath3 .",
    "each of these strategy ` books ' thus has @xmath196 pages , one for each pattern .",
    "there are @xmath197 possible books an agent can buy and use as guidelines on how to trade .",
    "an agent in possession of one of these strategy ` books ' , whichever he chooses to buy , can find a page giving guidelines on how to trade in _ every _ possible market state .",
    "the books are thus ` complete ' .",
    "it seems unlikely however , that in reality such a ` complete ' book would exist for any arbitrary value of @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , even if such a book did exist , it is unlikely that a given market participant would consider all the pages as being true .",
    "for example , page one of a strategy book may say that if the asset price has fallen three days running , one should sell assets on the fourth day .",
    "page three may say that if the asset price has fallen , then recovered and then fallen again , it is advisable to buy .",
    "the agent holding this book may well believe in page one but think that the guidelines of page three are rubbish : in particular , he considers the pattern down - up - down to correspond to no trading signal at all . this agent would therefore continue to hold any previous position he had if he saw the pattern down - up - down .",
    "we therefore propose a generalization to the strategy structure of the mg to account for the fact that strategy ` books ' may be incomplete , or equivalently that agents do not trust some of the trading signals .",
    "before trading commences , each agent goes through each of her ( complete ) strategy ` books ' page by page , and decides whether she believes in the trading guidelines given for each of the possible @xmath7 market ` signals ' . the agents choose to accept each page of each of their books with a probability @xmath198 .",
    "if the agent rejects a page of the strategy ` book ' , they replace the suggested action for time @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath44   } \\in\\left [ -1,1\\right ]   $ ] , by a null action @xmath44   } = \\ast$ ] .",
    "when trading commences , the agents are then faced with deciding what course of action to take when their strategy ` books ' register the null action at time @xmath5 .",
    "one type of possible behavior would be to maintain their prior course of action , i.e. @xmath44   } = a_{r}^{\\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   } $ ] .",

    "this is due to the fact that the agents will not trade unless they receive a market signal for which they have a non - null strategy action .",

    "a market - maker using a price formation such as equation [ eq price formation mult mm ] can however be arbitraged by the agents . whether the market - maker is actually arbitraged is then purely dependent on the underlying dynamics of the market .",

    "if more agents are long rather than short at time @xmath5 ( @xmath52   > 0 $ ] ) , then the price movement @xmath214   $ ] is positive .",
    "the agents will then have benefitted from a positive increment in their notional wealth from simply holding their position .",
    "this manipulation of the ( naive ) market - maker leads to an unstable state whereby the agents arbitrage the market - maker simply by holding their long / short positions and watching the price rise / fall .",
    "this unstable state of the market will occur with increasing probability as the agents become more coordinated in their actions , i.e. as @xmath3 is decreased .",
    "for high @xmath3 , where there is no longer significant agent coordination and no crowding affects , the $ g[eq strat payoff posnwealth ] model with equation [ eq price dolg mm ] for the price formation is able to avoid the unstable attractor and thus produce more ` market - like ' time - series as demonstrated in ref .",
    "we can also examine the changing wealth of the market - maker by simply employing equation [ eq agent wealth chng ] .",
    "we know that @xmath212   = -a\\left [   t-1\\right ] $ ] , so equation [ eq agent wealth chng ] combined with equation [ eq price dolg mm ] gives us : @xmath215    &   = \\phi_{m}\\left [   t\\right ]   \\delta p\\left [   t+1,1\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}a\\left [   t\\right ]   a\\left [   t-1\\right ]   -\\left ( \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{m}}-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right )   a\\left [   t-1\\right ] ^{2}\\label{eq mm wealth chng}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of @xmath216 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we see can see - by taking a time average of equation [ eq mm wealth chng ] - that whether the market - maker s wealth increases or decreases with time will depend on the dynamics of the market . if the market is persistent as in the unstable case at low @xmath3 , the market maker loses wealth since @xmath217 a\\left [   t-1\\right ]   \\right\\rangle > 0 $ ] .",
    "conversely if the market is anti - persistent , the market - maker will gain wealth since @xmath218   a\\left [   t-1\\right ]   \\right\\rangle < 0 $ ] .    at first sight",

    "neither of these choices seem desirable in the quest for producing a realistic market model .",
    "following the introduction to the community of the minority game , there have been many proposed agent based market models , many of which exhibit the ` stylized facts ' of financial market timeseries in certain parameter ranges .",
    "it seems however that many of these market models include one or more basic assumptions which seem implausible when compared to the actions of real financial market agents .    with the first ` wave ' of market models it seemed remarkable that so many of the stylized features of real financial timeseries were reproduced so well . with more and more market model contenders entering the community , each with a quite diverse set of assumptions , it started to look as though it was easy to find models which would reproduce realistic market - like dynamics .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that general systems which have activity based on a waiting time problem , will all enjoy the scaling properties seen in financial market data .",
    "notwithstanding this observation , we believe that it is not at all obvious how one can produce a self - consistent market model which embodies , in a _ non - stochastic _",
    "way , the behavior of realistic financial market agents , and yet can reproduce the ` stylized facts ' of real financial markets . as we have shown in this work , adaptation of the mg payoff structure to incorporate a more realistic objective function results in a model increasingly dominated by trending as agents resources are increased . as a result of this",
    "we are forced to look to a wider class of agent behavior and heterogeneity in order to recover the dynamical behavior we are looking for .",
    "this paper has provided a discussion of different aspects of market models and how they interact with each other . instead of proposing a unique new market model of our own ( thereby adding to the increasing family in the literature ) , we have examined the different features one may want to include in a market model , and then discussed what their effect would be .",
    "we hope that the resulting discussion has managed to provide a basic of toolbox of model features , brought together by a common formalism .",
    "perhaps some optimal combination of a subset of these model features will provide a new self - consistent , realistic yet minimal market model .",
    "however it is likely that one needs a diversity not only of agent parameter values but also of agent behavior , if one is intent on forming _ the _ market model .",

    "<S> in light of the growing interest in agent - based market models , we bring together several earlier works in which we considered the topic of self - consistent market modelling . building upon the binary game structure of challet and zhang , we discuss generalizations of the strategy reward scheme such that the agents seek to maximize their wealth in a more direct way . </S>",
    "<S> we then examine a disturbing feature whereby such reward schemes , while appearing microscopically acceptable , lead to unrealistic market dynamics ( e.g. instabilities ) . finally , we discuss various mechanisms which are responsible for re - stabilizing the market in reality . </S>",
    "<S> this discussion leads to a ` toolbox ' of processes from which , we believe , successful market models can be constructed in the future .    0.5 in    oxford center for computational finance working paper : _ occf/010702 _ </S>"
