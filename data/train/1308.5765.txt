    "several brane - world scenarios , inspired by superstring / m theory , have been proposed to resolve various puzzles in particle physics and cosmology , in which our observable four - dimensional ( 4d ) universe may be a hypersurface embedded within a higher - dimensional space - time , usually named a bulk . in this scenario ,",
    "the standard model particles are restricted to the brane , while the gravitons are free to propagate into the whole space ( see , for example , the review @xcite ) . among these , the randall - sundrum single brane model ( rs2 model ) @xcite provides a new perspective on the brane - world phenomenology with a noncompact extra dimension , where a single 3-brane is embedded in a five - dimensional ( 5d ) anti  de sitter ( ads@xmath0 ) bulk . despite the infinite extra dimension with a continuum of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes , the 5d graviton zero mode , at sufficiently low energies , is localized on the brane and standard general relativity ( gr ) is precisely recovered , due to the warped bulk geometry .    in the setup of the rs2 brane - world model",
    ", there are two natural generalizations of the gravitational action .",
    "the first modification , based on the nature of higher dimensions , is a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term in the 5d bulk action , leading to the most general second - order derivative field equation of the bulk metric @xcite .",
    "moreover , motivated by string / m theory in the low - energy limit , this gb correction corresponds to the leading - order correction in the effective action of heterotic string theory and is free of ghosts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gb term is also essential in the chern - simons gauge theory of gravity in odd dimensions @xcite .",
    "in addition , quantum corrections generated via quantum loops of matter fields on the brane coupled to the bulk gravitons will induce a second modification to the rs2 model , the leading correction of which is described through an induced gravity ( ig ) term , i.e. , a 4d ricci scalar , in the brane action @xcite .",
    "since both effects are the leading corrections to the rs2 brane - world model , we investigate here a generalized rs2 model taking into account both the gb and ig curvature effects .",
    "in particular , we will look into the early inflationary scenario and study the evolution of the gravitational waves generated during an extreme slow - roll inflation on the brane . in this framework ,",
    "the background of this scenario is modeled approximately by a de sitter brane embedded in an ads@xmath0 bulk , on which the primordial gravitational waves will be affected in particular by gb and ig corrections .",
    "cosmological perturbations in a quasi  de sitter inflation have been previously studied in the rs2 model @xcite , and in the generalized rs2 model with just the gb effect @xcite or ig effect alone @xcite .",
    "in addition , the scalar perturbations in the generalized rs2 model with both the gb and the ig curvature effects have recently been investigated as well in ref .",
    "@xcite .    taking both gb and ig curvature effects into consideration",
    ", we compare their effects on the behavior of the primordial gravitational waves with those generated in the pure rs2 model . the mass spectrum of kk modes derived in this scenario for the normal branch [ see eq.([friedmann ] ) for @xmath1 is exactly the same as that in the rs2 model .",
    "in addition , we show that both gb and ig corrections tend to decrease the rs2 enhancement of the amplitude of the tensor perturbations ; in fact , the amplitude will be strongly suppressed by the gb effect at relatively high energies . a similar behavior has been obtained for the scalar perturbations in the same system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gb effect , as compared with the standard 4d general relativity results , will drastically raise the tensor - to - scalar ratio in the relatively high - energy regime and moderately break the standard consistency relation , which can not be avoided by incorporating the ig effect .",
    "we note that the rs2 model with or without the ig effect fulfills the consistency relation",
    ". however , these significant changes caused by the gb effect , will be only mildly counterbalanced by the ig effect at high energies .",
    "finally , we will discuss some implications of the observational constraints on the primordial gravitational waves in this model .",

    "for the heavy modes , with mass scale @xmath139 , the asymptotic solutions of the wave equation ( [ waveeq ] ) is an oscillating function as @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , these heavy modes correspond to the continuous spectrum and are normalizable as plane waves . on the other hand , the asymptotic solutions for the light modes , with @xmath140 , contain in general exponentially growing and decaying modes at infinity , in which only the asymptotic decreasing modes , picked by the junction condition , are normalizable . as we discussed earlier , the zero - mode @xmath122 in the normal branch is a normalizable solution , but we still need to check whether there exist normalizable light modes other than the zero mode .    to examine the existence of normalizable light modes besides the zero - mode @xmath122 , it is convenient to introduce new modes defined by @xcite @xmath141 which are the partners of the modes @xmath114 in supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
