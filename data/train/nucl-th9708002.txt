    "a nucleon - nucleon interaction is efficiently parametrized in terms of meson exchange diagrams . apart from the largely model independent one pion exchange contribution ,",
    "a small family of heavier mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , sometimes also @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) effectively summing and representing the multipole pion exchanges and excitations of nucleon resonances in intermediate states is considered . the structure of the couplings of these ( effective ) mesons to nucleons is not very well known and is treated phenomenologically : vertices are usually taken in some simple form , neglecting effects due to possible transition of the nucleons off their mass shell , and coupling constants and coupling parameters are fitted to data .    some relativistic calculations @xcite have found that including off - shell extensions of these meson - nucleon vertices might give a more effective description .",
    "in particular , stadler and gross @xcite have shown in a covariant spectator formalism that using a scalar - nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) coupling with off - shell extension can give a reasonable triton binding energy ( without explicit three - nucleon forces ) , and at the same time improve the fit to @xmath0 data as compared to that of similar model without off - shell coupling .",
    "zimanyi and moszkowski have shown that a lagrangian with a derivative ( off - shell ) @xmath7 coupling improves the description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei in the relativistic mean - field approximation . and a number of authors have studied off - shell couplings using sidewise dispersion relations , which suggest that the off - shell behavior should be related to @xmath8 scattering and higher nucleon resonances@xcite .    here , we would like to demonstrate how we can use nucleon field redefinition to translate the dynamical model of @xcite into a model with nonlinear couplings with standard on - shell vertices .",
    "first , as an example , we demonstrate the nontrivial dynamical content of off - shell vertices using the well known @xmath4-model .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the scalar - exchange part of the stadler and gross @xcite model . we show that the off - shell coupling can be removed via a redefinition of the nucleon field and identify the nonstandard nonlinear strong and electromagnetic ( e.m . ) vertices . in leading order the difference between the model with off - shell coupling and the standard one",
    "is represented by triangle and bubble diagrams for the @xmath0-interaction , scalar - scalar exchange three - nucleon potential , and a contact ( seagull ) meson exchange current . in sec .",
    "iv we give explicit expressions for these contributions and argue that they should be estimated numerically . finally , in secs .",
    "v and vi we discuss electromagnetic interactions and some features of the nonrelativistic limits of these interactions . in the appendix",
    "we show that similar considerations also apply for pseudoscalar and vector exchanges .",
    "to illustrate the rich dynamical content of off - shell couplings , let us consider the simple example of a @xmath4-model .",
    "the standard lagrangian of the linear @xmath4- model is @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath4-model results from replacing @xmath11 by a nonlinear function of the pion field with constant norm @xmath12 .",
    "the common choice is @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which leads to a lagrangian @xmath16 where the trace is taken in flavor space . in the lowest order in pion fields",
    "the second term gives the kinetic energy for massless pions , while higher orders generate complicated nonlinear pion self - interactions .",
    "the last term of ( [ lnonlin1 ] ) in the lowest order generates the nucleon mass @xmath17 , the first order in the pion field is the pseudoscalar @xmath18 coupling , and higher orders represent multipion contact terms .",
    "alternatively , @xmath19 can be taken in the form @xmath20 which yields @xmath21 we can eliminate the higher order nonlinear terms from the @xmath18 couplings by redefining the nucleon field as follows : @xmath22 which gives the equivalent lagrangian @xmath23 note that _ all of the @xmath18 interaction terms involving the coupling of three or more pions to a nucleon in the original lagrangian ( [ nonlin2 ] ) have been replaced by terms which are only linear or quadratic in the pion field _ , but which involve couplings to off - shell nucleons .",
    "we now emphasize two points .",
    "the two lagrangians ( [ nonlin2 ] ) and ( [ nonlin3 ] ) are equivalent _ only _ if _ all _ of the nonlinear terms in the factor @xmath24 are retained .",
    "if this factor is truncated to lowest order , @xmath25 , the lagrangians are _ no longer equivalent_. the second point is that the lagrangian ( [ nonlin3 ] ) is deceptively simple .",
    "in particular , at most two pions couple to a nucleon at any point . still , it contains all the complexity of the nonlinear @xmath4-model with all of its multipion contact terms .",
    "naively , one might argue that the off - shell term is unimportant in realistic nuclear applications , since it is nonzero only for off - shell nucleons . indeed , in the lowest semiclassical order of two meson exchange it does not contribute .",
    "but as momentum loops are included the off - shell vertices give results compatible with original nonlinear @xmath4-model . iterating the off - shell vertices of ( [ nonlin3 ] ) along the same nucleon line immediately generates multipion contact terms with any number of pions , since the off - shell factors ( @xmath26 in momentum space ) of the vertex cancel the attached nucleon propagators",
    "however , it might be nontrivial to define the effective theory based on the lagrangian ( [ nonlin3 ] ) .",
    "this is because the nucleon field has complicated transformation properties and one has to be careful in defining the regularization so that the symmetry is preserved and the theory is equivalent to the usual nonlinear @xmath4-model .",
    "we are interested in a more phenomenological approach in which only a limited set of feynman diagrams ( regularized by ad hoc hadronic form factors ) is used in a kernel of a dynamical equation . in this case , the dynamics defined by ( [ nonlin3 ] ) is no longer fully equivalent to the @xmath4-model , but it is still clearly distinct from the standard prescriptions employing the linearized form of the @xmath18 interaction .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of off - shell couplings associated with the exchange of scalar particles .",
    "let us now consider the scalar coupling with the off - shell extension which plays an important role in the dynamical model discussed in ref .",
    "we will first show how the off - shell part of the @xmath7 coupling can be removed with the help of the nucleon field redefinition .",
    "the field redefinition generates the nonlinear scalar - nucleon and photon - scalar - nucleon vertices . in the next sections , we present the contributions of these vertices to the @xmath0 potential , the @xmath1 potential and the e.m .  exchange currents in the leading order beyond conventional results .",
    "the part of lagrangian relevant to our discussion is @xmath27 where @xmath28 includes all of the kinetic terms for the bosons ( scalars and photons ) , @xmath29 is the nucleon kinetic lagrangian with the mass term , and @xmath30 is a photon - scalar vertex .",
    "the function @xmath31 contains an isospin matrix for the mesons with nonzero isospin ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 in the off - shell part of the @xmath7 vertex is related to the parameter @xmath34 of @xcite through @xmath35 and the @xmath7 vertex function in the momentum space reads @xmath36 in ( [ lgnn ] ) we have separated a minimal part of the @xmath37 vertex @xmath38 with the proton charge @xmath39 , from the remaining purely transverse one @xmath40 . the minimal contact ( seagull ) interaction",
    "is contained in @xmath41 .",
    "it is obtained by minimal substitution of the derivatives of the nucleon field in ( [ lsnn ] ) @xmath42 the nonminimal part of the photon - nucleon coupling @xmath40 has been given in a framework of effective meson - nucleon theories by gross and riska @xcite .",
    "in simplified models , @xmath43 and @xmath40 are often taken as the dirac and pauli parts of the @xmath37 vertex , proportional to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the similarity of ( [ lnkin ] ) and ( [ lsnn ] ) suggests that the off - shell vertex can be removed by the nucleon field redefinition @xcite @xmath46 in terms of the new field @xmath47 the lagrangian ( [ lagrs0 ] ) reads @xmath48 as in the previous section , the off - shell meson - nucleon vertex can be transformed away in favor of complicated nonlinear contact interactions .",
    "the leading term of the nonlinear scalar - nucleon term is the conventional scalar - nucleon vertex , the terms with derivatives of the scalar field @xmath49 contribute only for the scalar with nonzero isospin .",
    "while the off - shell interaction can be easily included in covariant dynamical equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems , one can not take the nonlinear vertices to all orders , and hence in practice the two forms of the lagrangian are not equivalent ( although they are in principle ) . in an energy region where the effective meson - nucleon description is valid , the importance of the multimeson exchanges and/or exchanges of heavy mesons decreases with increasing summed mass of exchanged mesons .",
    "in particular , since the mass of the effective scalar meson is typically @xmath50 mev , it might be interesting to consider the effects of nonlinearities up to second order in the scalar field , and see if the differences between a truncated version of ( [ lagrs ] ) and the orignial ( [ lagrs0 ] ) can be explained mostly by the second order terms .",
    "since the original lagrangian ( [ lagrs0 ] ) depends on the off - shell parameter @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) , so also will physical observables , like phase shifts and the @xmath1 binding energy ( parameters of the model @xcite are fine tuned to leave the deuteron binding energy unchanged ) .",
    "however , the leading order one meson exchange interaction does not depend on @xmath51 , at least for external legs on - shell .",
    "but nucleon interactions with two exchanged mesons , or interactions with external fields with at least one meson simultaneously exchanged , are already dependent on the choice of @xmath51 .",
    "we present the corresponding @xmath51-dependent operators below , first for the two - scalar exchange @xmath0 and @xmath1 potentials and then for the one - scalar exchange e.m .",
    "since the local field redefinition does not change the physical @xmath53-matrix elements , the @xmath0-interaction generated by the lagrangian ( [ lagrs ] ) with nonlinear @xmath7 couplings should give the same result as the lagrangian ( [ lagrs0 ] ) where the nonlinear couplings are replaced by off - shell couplings .",
    "it is easy to see that the leading , second order contributions due to a single scalar exchange are the same in both frameworks . in this section",
    "we show that this is also true of the fourth order , two scalar exchange terms .",
    "the demonstration illustrates explicitly how the off - shell couplings generate higher order contact terms .",
    "two scalar exchange contributions with off - shell couplings are represented by the box and crossed box contributions of fig .",

    "( [ tri ] ) and ( [ bub ] ) are suppressed by extra powers of @xmath71 .",
    "hence , at least in the leading order , the @xmath34-dependent two - scalar exchange contributions have very simple structure .",
    "the @xmath34-dependent two - scalar exchange @xmath0 potentials follow from ( [ tri ] ) and ( [ bub ] ) by a straightforward nonrelativistic reduction of the vertices , in particular @xmath72 .",
    "the triangle and bubble diagram contributions to the @xmath0 potential in the leading order in @xmath71 were recently constructed by rijken and stoks @xcite for pions and @xmath4-mesons , where only positive - energy nucleons were considered in intermediate states .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether the contributions derived above could account for a sizable part of dynamical difference between a model with the standard @xmath7 coupling and a model with its off - shell extension .",
    "to this end one should fix all other meson parameters and fit the conventional model to the @xmath0 data .",
    "then one could compare the effects of adding either an off - shell vertex or the triangle and bubble interactions to the potential .",
    "the two - scalar exchange also contributes to the three - nucleon potential shown on fig .",

    "this gives a very simple , central three - nucleon potential , which is attractive for @xmath75 , in agreement with the increased binding for negative @xmath76 observed in @xcite .",
    "together with the triangle contributions to the @xmath0 interaction discussed above , this three - nucleon potential should account for part of the large effect of the off - shell scalar coupling on the triton binding energy @xcite .",

    "instead , a nonminimal , purely transverse contact interaction appears .",
    "it is , of course , not clear that the lagrangian with off - shell coupling from which we start should have _ a minimal _ contact e.m .",
    "but , in any case , the field definition ( [ fscal ] ) transforms the nuclear electromagnetic current ( [ lgnn ] ) into an interaction current , which to lowest order in the scalar field is @xmath80 this must be added to the transformation of whatever other contact interaction replaces ( [ lgnns ] ) in the original lagrangian .",

    "this term gives the following contribution to the charge density @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the charge of the first nucleon as an operator in isospin space .",
    "this term has a structure which is very similar to the retardation contribution from sigma exchange estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was found to give a nonnegligible contribution to the deuteron and trinucleon form factors .",
    "we therefore expect ( [ delrhocons ] ) also to give a nonnegligible effect .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results for off - shell scalar exchange to results which have been previously obtained from the study of off - shell pion exchanges .",

    "the last term on the r.h.s .  of ( [ unit ] ) , @xmath94 , follows from the explicit dependence of the _ underlying lagrangian _ on the mixing parameter @xmath92 , at the one - pion exchange level it is just the nonminimal contact exchange current . if the chiral lagrangian is employed @xmath95 .",
