    "<S> we measure these metrics on artificial ( roads , highways , railways ) and natural networks ( leaves , slime mould , insect wings ) and show that there are fundamental differences in the organization of urban and biological systems , related to their function , navigation or distribution : straight lines are organized hierarchically in biological cases , and have random lengths and locations in urban systems . in the case of time </S>",
    "<S> evolving networks , the simplicity is able to reveal important structural changes during their evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> a planar network is a graph that can be drawn on the two - dimensional plane such that no edges cross each other @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> planar graphs pervade many aspects of science : they are the subject of numerous studies in graph theory , in combinatorics @xcite and in quantum gravity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> planar graphs are also central in biology where they can be used to describe veination patterns of leaves or insect wings . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the vasculature of leaves @xcite displays an interesting architecture with many loops at different scales , while in insects , the vascular network brings strength and flexibility to their wings . in city science , planar networks are extensively used to represent , to a good approximation , various infrastructure networks @xcite . in particular , transportation networks @xcite and more recently streets patterns @xcite are the subject of many studies @xcite that are trying to characterize both topological ( degree distribution , clustering , etc . ) and geometrical ( angles , segment length , face area distribution , etc . ) aspects of these networks .    despite a large number of studies on planar networks , </S>",
    "<S> there is still a lack of global , high - level metrics allowing to characterize their structure and geometrical patterns . </S>",
    "<S> such a characterization is however difficult to achieve and in this article , we will discuss an important aspect of planar graphs which is intimately connected to their geometrical organization . in this respect , we will define new metrics and test them on various datasets , both artificial ( roads , highways , railways , and supply networks ) and natural ( veination patterns of leaves and wings , slime mould ) enabling us to obtain new information about the structure of these networks .    we will now introduce the main metrics used in this article . generally speaking , we can define different types of paths for a given pair of nodes @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a usual quantity is the shortest euclidean path of length @xmath1 which minimizes the distance travelled to go from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we can however ask for another path which minimizes the number of turns - the simplest path , of length @xmath4 ( if there are more than one such path we choose the shortest one ) . fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : illus]a displays an example of the shortest and simplest path for a given pair of nodes on the oxford ( uk ) street network .    to identify the simplest path , we first convert the graph from the primal to the dual representation , where each node corresponds to a straight line in the primal graph . </S>",
    "<S> these straight lines are determined by a continuity negotiation - like algorithm , as described in material and methods . </S>",
    "<S> edges in dual space , in turn , represent the intersection of straight lines in the primal graph ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : illus]b ) .        </S>",
    "<S> we define the number of turns @xmath5 of a given path as the number of switches from one straight line to another when walking along this path . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is intimately related to the amount of information required to move along the path @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the probability distribution @xmath6 for all shortest and simplest paths of several networks ( see si ) and the results show that this distribution is usually centered around a smaller values for the simplest paths than for the shortest paths , as expected . more generally , we show in the supplementary information that the average number of turns @xmath7 versus the number of nodes @xmath8 indeed displays a small - world type behavior characterized by a slow logarithmic increase with @xmath8 , consistently with previous analysis of the dual network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is thus not very useful to distinguish different networks and shows that the distribution of the number of turns is a very partial information and tells very little about the spatial structure of the simplest paths . for navigation purposes ( neglecting all congestion effects ) and in order to understand the structure of the network , it is useful to compare the lengths of the shortest and the simplest paths with the ratio @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> . it is then natural to introduce the _ simplicity index _ @xmath10 as the average @xmath11 the simplicity index is larger than one and exactly equal to one for a regular square lattice and any tree - like network for example . </S>",
    "<S> large values of @xmath10 indicate that the simplest paths are on average much longer than the shortest ones , and that the network is not easily navigable . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that we do not take into account congestion effects which can influence the path choice ( see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this new metric is a first indication about the spatial structure of simplest paths but mixes various scales , and in order to obtain a more detailed information , we define the _ simplicity profile _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the euclidean distance between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and where @xmath14 is the number of pairs of nodes at euclidean distance @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity @xmath16 is larger than one and its variation with @xmath15 informs us about the large scale structure of these graphs . </S>",
    "<S> we can draw a generic shape of this profile : for small @xmath15 , we are the scale of nearest neighbors and there is a large probability that the simplest and shortest paths have the same length , yielding @xmath17 , and increasing for small @xmath15 . for very large @xmath15 , it is almost always beneficial to take long straight lines when they exist , thus reducing the difference between the simplest and the shortest paths . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we expect @xmath16 to decrease when @xmath18 ( note that a similar behavior is observed for another quantity , the route - length efficiency , introduced in @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . the simplicity profile will then display in general at least one maximum at an intermediate scale @xmath19 for which the length differences between the shortest and the simplest path is maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the length @xmath19 thus represents the typical size of domains not crossed by long straight lines . at this intermediate scale </S>",
    "<S> , the detour needed to find long straight lines for the simplest paths is very large .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally note here that these indices are actually not limited to planar networks but to all networks for which the notion of straight lines has a sense and can be computed . </S>",
    "<S> this would be the case for example for spatial networks which are not perfectly planar  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a null model in order to provide a simple benchmark to further analyze the results obtained by these new metrics ( the expression null model should be understood here in the sense of the benchmark and not in the usual statistical definition ) . the goal in this study </S>",
    "<S> is to compare empirical results with a very simple model based on a minimal number of assumptions , but we note that it would be also interesting to compare various models generating planar networks . </S>",
    "<S> we start with @xmath8 points randomly distributed in the plane and construct the voronoi graph ( see the supplementary information for further details ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then add a tunable number of straight lines of length @xmath20 distributed according to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> examples of networks generated by this model as well as many results are shown in the si .    </S>",
    "<S> we first study static networks ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : all ] ) such as the streets of cities ( bologna , italy ; oxford , uk ; nantes , france ) , the national highway network of australia , the national uk railway system , and the water supply network of central nantes ( france ) . in the case of biological networks , we study the veination patterns of leaves ( _ ilex aquifolium _ and _ hymenanthera chatamica _ ) , and of a dragongly wing . </S>",
    "<S> details on these datasets can be found in the si .        </S>",
    "<S> we also consider three datasets describing the time evolution of networks at different scales ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : evolution ] ) : at a small scale and in the biological realm we study the evolution of a slime mould network . at the city scale we present results on the road network of paris ( france ) from 1789 until now . </S>",
    "<S> paris was largely transformed by a central authority ( the prefect haussmann under napoleon iii ) in the middle of the 19th century and the dataset studied here displays the network before and after these important transformations , offering the possibility to study quantitatively the effect of top - down planning @xcite . at the multi - town level , we study the road network of the groane area ( italy ) ( see the si for details on these datasets ) . </S>",
    "<S> these networks allow us to explore different systems at very different scales from @xmath22 ( slime mould ) to @xmath23 ( australian highways ) meters .        </S>",
    "<S> we compute the simplicity index @xmath10 for the various datasets and for the null model as well . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svalues ] as a function of the density of straight lines @xmath24 and the gini coefficient @xmath25 for the length of straight lines ( see material and methods for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the density @xmath24 of straight lines is defined as the ratio of total length of straight lines ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> si2 ) , over the total length of the network , and @xmath25 is an indicator of the diversity of the length of straight lines .    the first observation from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svalues ] is that the simplicity index encodes information which is neither contained in the density @xmath24 nor in the gini coefficient @xmath25 , and reveals how the straight lines are distributed in space and participate in the flows on the network .        in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svalues]a , we observe that the density of straight lines is always larger for urban systems . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in the biological systems the density lies in the range @xmath26 $ ] , while we observe @xmath27 for artificial systems . </S>",
    "<S> except for the physarum , which appears to be close to a regular lattice with a small simplicity and small gini coefficient , the simplicity index for the wing and the leaves is larger than the values obtained for the null model . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the organization of straight lines in biological systems is very different from artificial systems , that have very similar values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we observe a hierarchy of straight lines in biological systems ( see fig  [ fig : all ] ) : a main artery ( the midrib for leaves ) connects to veins which in turn are connect to smaller veins and so on . in the case of dragonfly wing , </S>",
    "<S> the main straight line is given by the external border of the network . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these main straight lines in biological systems will impact the structure of simplest paths and impose some large detour , resulting in a larger value of the simplicity index .    for urban systems , </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity is very close to the null model ( of order @xmath28 in this density range ) , suggesting that in dense urban systems , long straight lines are added at random ( an exception concerns , the pre - haussmannian paris ( 1789 - 1836 ) for which we observe a simplicity smaller than for the null model , the reason being probably that the networks at these times were very sparse ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> navigation on urban systems requires relatively less information with no additional cost : the simplest path is not too different from the shortest path .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note an interesting effect in the null model in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : svalues]a which is the existence of a maximum of the simplicity at densities of order @xmath29 . in this density regime , using straight lines implies having to make large detours . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the density exceeds @xmath30 , there are enough straight lines to enable a simplest path which differs not too much from the shortest one .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the simplicity profile shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : all ] . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that basically for most of these systems , the simplicity profile displays the generic shape with a maximum at an intermediate scale . </S>",
    "<S> in urban cases , such as bologna and central nantes , we have a typical monocentric system with a dense center and a few important radial straight lines , leading to a simple profile @xmath16 . in the case of oxford and the australian highway network , </S>",
    "<S> the polycentric organization leads to multiple peaks in the simplicity profile ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : all ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we observe that the profiles for australian highways and railways in the uk are very different , despite their similar scale , density @xmath24 , and gini coefficient @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the uk railway displays small values of the simplicity ( less than @xmath31 ) while for the australian highway network there are many pairs of nodes for which the simplest path is much longer than the shortest one . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the profile for both street and water systems of nantes have a very similar shape , pointing to the fact that these networks are strongly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the position and the height of the peak ( @xmath32 ) observed for the nantes water system suggests that this distribution system has similar features compared to biological systems such as vein networks in leaves ( see below ) whose function is also distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> compared to urban systems , the simplicity profile of biological networks have a single well - defined , and much more pronounced peak . </S>",
    "<S> we observe values of order @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 , meaning that for this range of distance , the detour made by the simplest path is very large . </S>",
    "<S> this peak is related to the existence of domains of typical size @xmath19 not crossed by large veins . </S>",
    "<S> we see here a clear effect of the existence of the spatial organization of long straight lines in these systems , probably optimized for the distribution ( of water for leaves ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decay for large @xmath15 is also much faster in the biological case compared to urban systems : this shows that in biological systems there are long straight lines allowing to connect far away nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly evident on the leaves shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : all ] where we can see the first levels ( primary and secondary ) veins , the rest forming a network . for streets , the organization is much less rigid and the hierarchy less strict : we have a more uniform spatial distribution of straight lines , leading to a smoother decrease of @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> going beyond static networks , we apply our new metrics to study the structural changes of time evolving networks .    </S>",
    "<S> the first example of a time evolving network is the road network of the groane region which is a @xmath36 area located north of milan @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have 7 snapshots of this network for different times from 1833 to 2007 ( see the supplementary information for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this region evolved without central planning and is thus a good example of an ` organic ' evolution of urban systems . the simplicity profile shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : evolution](a ) allows us to distinguish two different periods . the first period from 1833 to 1955 displays a relatively small simplicity at all scales , while a distinct second regime appears from 1980 until now . in this latter regime , </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity profile is substantially larger for all scales . </S>",
    "<S> this is an effect of the massive urban densification , leading to a polycentric structure where the readability and the ease to navigate are drastically lowered .    at a smaller scale , </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of central paris between 1789 and 1999 . </S>",
    "<S> this dataset provides an interesting case study , as paris experienced larges changes due to haussmann in the middle of the 19th century ( see @xcite for details and more references about this network ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an opportunity to observe quantitatively the effect of top - down planning : until 1836 , we are in the pre - haussmann paris , while from 1888 until now we are in the post - haussmann period . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of haussmann s central planning is clearly visible on the network shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : evolution](b ) . from 1789 to 1836 </S>",
    "<S> , we have a relatively large simplicity at all scales and we observe a decrease in that period at small scales ( @xmath37 ) which corresponds well to the fact that many religious and aristocratic domains and properties were sold and divided in order to create new houses and new roads , improving congestion inside paris . the 1826 - 1836 transition displays a decrease of the simplicity for distance larger than roughly @xmath38 kms ( corresponding to @xmath39 ) indicating that long distance routes were simplified . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that during this period the eastern part of paris experienced large transformations with the construction of the channel st . </S>",
    "<S> martin . </S>",
    "<S> finally in the period 1836 to 1888 , when paris experienced haussmann s transformation , the simplicity profile is strongly affected : compared to 1836 , the simplicity is improved in the range @xmath40 $ ] , which can be attributed to the construction of large avenues connecting important nodes of the city . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we observe the surprising effect that at large scales @xmath41 , the simplicity is degraded by haussmann s work : this however could be an artifact of the method and the fact that we considered a portion of paris only and neglected the effect of surroundings .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that differences between groane and paris might be explained in terms of a sparse , polycentric urban settlement ( groane ) versus a dense one ( paris ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the ` urban ' phase for groane ( after 1955 ) , the simplicity profile becomes similar to the one of a dense urban area such as paris .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the results in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : evolution](c ) for the _ physarum policephalum _ , a biological system evolving at the centimeter scale . </S>",
    "<S> _ physarum _ is a unicellular multinucleated amoeboid that during its vegetative state takes a complex shape . </S>",
    "<S> its plasmodium viscous body whose goal is to find and connect to food sources , crystallizes in a planar network - like structure of micro - tubes @xcite . in simple terms </S>",
    "<S> , physarum s foraging strategy can be summarized in two phases : i ) the exploration phase in which it grows and reacts to the environment and ii ) the crystallization phase in which it connects to food sources with micro - tubes . </S>",
    "<S> we inoculated active plasmodium over a single food source and observe the micro - tube network at six phases of its growth ( see si for details ) . under these conditions , we observe that the network is statistically isotropic around the food source as shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : evolution](c ) and develops essentially radially . </S>",
    "<S> we first observe that the simplicity profile for the physarum is relatively low ( less than @xmath31 ) , suggesting that simplicity could be an important factor in the evolution of this organism . </S>",
    "<S> a closer observation shows that during its evolution , the physarum adds new links to the previous network and also modifies the network on a larger scale , as revealed by the changes of the simplicity profile . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the profile is similar to the one obtained for the null model when the density is increased ( see si ) , suggesting that the statistics of straight lines in this case could be described as essentially resulting from the random addition of straight lines of random lengths ( with @xmath42 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the new metrics introduced here encode in a useful way both topological and geometrical information about the global structure of planar graphs . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our results highlight the structural differences between biological and artificial networks . in the former </S>",
    "<S> , we have a clear spatial organization of straight lines , with a clear hierarchy of lines ( midrib , veins , etc ) , leading to simplest paths that require a very small number of turns but at the cost of large detours . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , there is no such strong spatial organization in urban systems , where the simplicity is usually smaller and comparable to a null model with straight lines of random length and location . </S>",
    "<S> these differences between biological and urban systems might be related to the different functions of these networks : biological networks are mainly distribution networks serving the purpose of providing important fluids and materials . in contrast , the role of road networks is not only to distribute goods but to enable individuals to move from one point of the city to another . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , while biological networks are usually the result of a single process , urban systems are the product of a more complex evolution corresponding to different needs and technologies .    </S>",
    "<S> these new metrics also allow us to track important structural changes of these networks . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity profile thus appears as a useful tool which could provide a quantitative classification of planar graphs and could help in constructing a typology of leaves or street patterns for example . </S>"
