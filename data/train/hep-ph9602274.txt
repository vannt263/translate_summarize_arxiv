    "over the last few years the nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite has been used extensively to study numerous features of strong - interaction physics at low energies ( for recent reviews on mesons see  @xcite , and on baryons see  @xcite ) .",
    "the four - fermion point interaction leads to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking which plays a key role for the description of low - energy hadron phenomena .",
    "an attractive feature of the model is that having a small number of free parameters it allows for a unified description of mesons and baryons , with both two and three flavors .",
    "the resulting hadron spectroscopy has been quite successful : the basic mass relations , the electromagnetic form factors and the electromagnetic polarizabilities are reproduced reasonably well .",
    "all the above applications have been performed in the _ one - quark - loop _ approximation .",
    "the effective action , the meson and quark self - energies , vertex functions , _ etc .",
    "_ , are all generated by a quark - loop .",
    "this approximation is justified by the large-@xmath5 limit , where meson loops are @xmath6-suppressed .",
    "however , meson loops can not always be neglected since in the real world @xmath7 .",
    "more importantly , the pions are very light , and in many situations pionic effects , although formally @xmath6-suppressed , are enhanced because of the low pion mass .",
    "for example , pionic thermal excitations described by meson loops are dominating in hadronic systems at finite temperature .",
    "meson loops are also required for the proper description of heavier mesons .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 or the @xmath9 mesons can split into two pions and this effect is again described by pionic loops  @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of attempts  @xcite to include meson loops in the nambu  jona - lasinio model .",
    "these approaches are based on @xmath10 expansion in terms of feynman graphs .",
    "the symmetry properties of the system , however , can be easily violated by an inappropriate choice of diagrams .",
    "this is the case of refs .",
    "@xcite where basic symmetry relations , such as _ e.g. _ the goldstone theorem , are violated .",
    "the reason for this is that the equation determining the expectation value of the @xmath11 field and expressions for the meson propagators are not consistent .",
    "we show that in order to guarantee the validity of the goldstone theorem on the basis of a consistent @xmath12 expansion it is crucial to determine both the expectation value of the @xmath11 field and the meson propagators consistently , _",
    "e.g. _ using the effective action including one - meson - loop contributions .",
    "many - body methods which preserve the symmetry properties of the theory are called _ symmetry - conserving approximations _  @xcite . the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is up to our knowledge the only one which preserves the goldstone theorem at the one meson - loop level .",
    "this is achieved by a judicious choice of feynman diagrams . in this paper",
    "we extend consistently the nambu  jona - lasinio model to next - to - leading order in @xmath6 which includes the meson - loop contributions .",
    "we use the effective action formalism which leads in a natural way to a symmetry conserving approximation .",
    "our approach identifies the feynman diagrams which need to be included to maintain the symmetry properties , at any level of approximation . in our calculation",
    "the pion remains massless in the chiral limit and the basic relations following from ward - takahashi identities , such as the gell - mann  oaks  renner relation and the goldberger - treiman relation are satisfied .",
    "furthermore , the leading nonanalytic terms in the chiral expansion of @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 have the correct form , as given by chiral perturbation theory at the one - loop level @xcite .",
    "we calculate numerically the contributions of meson loops to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and find them to be substantial , of the order of 30% .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath5-counting scheme .    the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we recall the model , establish the basic notation and review the formalism of the effective action .",
    "we then proceed to evaluate the effective action at the quark - loop level ( sec .",
    "[ sec:1-q - l ] ) and at the meson - loop level ( sec .",
    "[ sec : loops ] ) , and derive expressions for the quark condensate ( sec .",

    "the partition function of the system is given by the path integral @xmath21 the integration is over the grassmann variables @xmath22 and @xmath19 , and @xmath23 is the euclidean action @xmath24 the partially bosonized version of the model  @xcite is obtained by introducing auxiliary meson fields @xmath25@xmath26   \\biggr\\ } ,   \\label{eq : zchi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the following notation @xmath27 the quark fields , which appear in the exponent of eq .",

    "the so called _ bosonized _ euclidean action @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where we use the dirac operator in the form @xmath32 with the one - particle dirac hamiltonian @xmath33 given by @xmath34 the trace in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seff ] ) involves an integration over space - time variables and a matrix trace over the spin and flavor degrees of freedom .",
    "the trace over color gives a factor @xmath5 which we write explicitly .",
    "recalling that the quark propagator in the background meson fields @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 , we refer to the term  @xmath37 as to the _ quark - loop contribution_.    for simplicity we use the following notation throughout the paper : the indices @xmath38 contain the field isospin indices @xmath39 and the space - time coordinates @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath41 , @xmath42 , _ etc .",
    "_ summation / integration over repeated indices is understood .",
    "generally , the quark - loop contribution @xmath37 can have an imaginary part which is related to the _ anomalous _ terms . in the case of su(2 ) with scalar and pseudoscalar mesons this imaginary part vanishes identically and the one - quark - loop contribution is given by the real part : @xmath43 such that the euclidean action can also be written in the form @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be written in the covariant form @xmath46 the bosonized action @xmath47 is a functional of the fields @xmath48 .",
    "the effective action in the one - meson - loop approximation is given by @xcite : @xmath49    the effective action ( [ eq : effaction ] ) has the following properties  @xcite :    * at the stationary point of the action , the values of the fields @xmath50 represent the ground - state expectation values of the field operators . *",
    "the inverse field propagators @xmath51 are equal to the second order derivatives of the effective action : @xmath52    calculated at the stationary point .",
    "the same result can be deduced by a resummation of feynman graphs , in terms of quark propagators which are dressed by a general static potential  @xcite .",
    "we refer to the action @xmath47 , which is leading order in @xmath53 , as the one - quark - loop approximation , and to the effective action  ( [ eq : effaction ] ) , including both the leading and next to leading order term @xmath54 , as the one - meson - loop approximation .",
    "we emphasize that in our approach they are both symmetry conserving approximations .",
    "most applications of the nambu jona - lasinio model so far , have neglected the contribution of the second term ( the meson loop contribution ) to the action ( [ eq : effaction ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to include this contribution in the description of the vacuum and the pion properties .",
    "we first consider the one - quark - loop approximation , in which the second term of the effective action ( [ eq : seffchi ] ) is neglected . in this approximation @xmath55 the effective action ( [ eq : effact ] ) is ultraviolet divergent and requires regularization . to this aim a fermion - loop cut - off @xmath56 is introduced .",
    "since the model is nonrenormalizable , the cut - off @xmath57 is kept finite and treated as a parameter .    in this paper",
    "we use two regularization schemes , namely the proper - time regularization and the covariant four - momentum o(4 ) regularization , as used in ref .",
    "we will compare results obtained with these schemes .",
