    "the kramers problem @xcite of thermally activated escape of an object over a potential barrier is one of the central problems of stochastic dynamics .",
    "it has been extensively studied not only for point particles @xcite but also for extended objects such as elastic strings which occur in a variety of contexts in condensed matter physics such as dislocation motion in crystals @xcite , motion of flux lines in type - ii superconductors @xcite , or charge - density waves @xcite .",
    "elastic strings activate over potential barriers by nucleation and subsequent separation of soliton - antisoliton pairs which are localized kink excitations @xcite .",
    "an analogous problem is the activated motion of a flexible polymer over a potential barrier @xcite .",
    "however , the thermally activated escape of a semiflexible polymer , which is a filament governed by its bending energy rather than entropic elasticity or tension , remained an open question that we want to address in this paper .",
    "semiflexible polymers such as dna or actin filaments have a large bending stiffness and , thus , a large persistence length , @xmath0 . on scales exceeding @xmath0",
    ", the orientational order of the polymer segments decays exponentially , and the polymer effectively behaves as a flexible chain with a segment size set by @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , on length scales which are small compared to @xmath0 , the bending energy of the semiflexible polymer strongly affects the behaviour of the polymer .",
    "the persistence lengths of the most prominent biopolymers range from @xmath1 for dna @xcite , to the @xmath2-range for actin @xcite or even up to the @xmath3-range for microtubules @xcite and becomes comparable to typical contour lengths of these polymers . whereas the adsorption of such semiflexible polymers onto homogeneous adhesive surfaces has been studied previously in @xcite , much less",
    "is known about the behaviour of a semiflexible polymer adsorbed on a _ structured _ surface .    in this article",
    "we focus on the escape of a semiflexible polymer over a translationally invariant potential barrier as shown in fig .",
    "[ potential ] , which can be realized on chemically or lithographically structured surfaces . the behaviour of semiflexible biopolymers on such structured substrates is of interest , e.g. , for electrophoresis applications  @xcite",
    ". another important class of semiflexible polymers are synthetic polyelectrolytes , whose self - assembly and dynamic behaviour on structured substrates has only been studied recently @xcite . in this article",
    "we consider homogeneous driving forces across the potential barriers as they can be easily realized on structured substrates by electric fields for charged polymers as in electrophoresis or by hydrodynamic flow . alternatively ,",
    "escape over a barrier can be driven by entropic forces arising from asymmetric shapes of the potential valleys @xcite .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "as for flexible polymers , the activated dynamics of semiflexible polymers is governed by the nucleation of localized kink - like excitations shown in fig .",
    "[ potential ] .",
    "we find , however , that the activated dynamics of semiflexible polymers is different from that of flexible polymers as kink properties are not governed by entropic elasticity of the polymer chain but rather by the bending energy of the semiflexible polymer .",
    "this enables us to determine the persistence length from kink - properties .",
    "furthermore , we calculate time scales for barrier crossing and the mean velocity of the semiflexible polymer for all regimes of driving forces : ( i ) nucleation and purely diffusive motion of single kinks ( ii ) nucleation and driven diffusive motion of single kinks and ( iii ) for large driving force dynamic equilibrium between nucleation and recombination in a kink ensemble .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a semiflexible polymer in 1 + 1 dimensions in a double - well potential that is translationally invariant in one direction , say the @xmath4-axis as in fig .",

    "the semiflexible polymer has a bending rigidity @xmath5 and persistence length @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the temperature in energy units .",
    "we focus on the regime where the potential is sufficiently strong that the semiflexible polymer is oriented along the @xmath4-axis and can be parameterized by displacements @xmath8 perpendicular to the @xmath4-axis with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the projected length of polymer .",

    "we consider a piecewise harmonic double - well potential @xmath12 that is independent of @xmath4 and thus translationally invariant in the @xmath4-direction , where @xmath13 is the depth of the potential and @xmath14 an external driving force density . below the critical force @xmath15",
    "the potential has two minima at @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) can be made dimensionless by measuring energies in units of a characteristic energy @xmath17 , the @xmath4-coordinate in units of a characteristic length @xmath18 and the @xmath19-coordinate in units of @xmath20 .",
    "we consider an overdamped dynamics of the semiflexible polymer with an equation of motion @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the damping constant and @xmath23 is a gaussian distributed thermal random force with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "at first we construct the static kink for @xmath26 , which is a localized metastable excitation .",
    "the static kink @xmath27 is defined as the configuration that minimizes the energy ( [ hamil ] ) , i.e. , is a time - independent solution of ( [ eom ] ) in the absence of thermal noise ( @xmath28 ) for boundary conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for @xmath26",
    "the potential is symmetric and @xmath31 such that the kink configuration is anti - symmetric with @xmath32 and centered at @xmath33 ( i.e.  @xmath34 ) . for our piecewise defined potential",

    "we want to point out that measurements of the kink width @xmath43 and the critical force density @xmath50 or the kink energy @xmath44 are sufficient to determine the bending rigidity @xmath51 and thus the persistence length @xmath52 if the distance @xmath53 between potential minima is known .    a static single kink in a polymer of length @xmath10 is equivalent to one half of a symmetric kink - antikink pair configuration with kink - antikink separation @xmath54 in a polymer of length @xmath55 , as shown in fig .",

    "a small kink density in combination with the condition @xmath65 also ensures that the semiflexible polymer stays oriented along the @xmath4-axis such that the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) stays valid .",
    "the condition @xmath64 of a small kink density is equivalent to @xmath66 . for sufficiently strong substrate potentials",
    "this gives a much wider range of applicability of the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) than in the absence of a potential where the condition @xmath67 of weak bending has to be fulfilled for a semiflexible polymer to be oriented .",
    "a driving force density @xmath14 leads to an asymmetry in the potential and an effective force on kinks . moving a kink by @xmath68 increases the polymer length in the lower potential minimum by @xmath69 and leads to an energy gain @xmath70 and thus a constant force @xmath71 on a kink . as argued above deviations from kink interactions",
