    "bistability is a phenomenon that readily occurs in classical systems that possess a nonlinear response to some input signal . in a bistable system",
    "the output function , @xmath0 , can exhibit two stable states for a certain range of the input @xmath1 such that when @xmath1 is varied @xmath0 follows a hysteresis loop .",
    "one of the most familiar examples is the hysteresis curve in the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material in the presence of an external magnetic field . in the context of electronics , digital flip - flop circuits and schmitt triggers are common examples of bistable circuits . in nonlinear optics , optical bistability ( ob )",
    "occurs in the input - output function of an optical resonator that contains a nonlinear dielectric and is driven by a laser @xcite .",
    "ob has a number of applications in optical communications and computing because it can be used to build all optical switches , logic gates , and optically bistable memory devices@xcite but is also interesting for basic studies of phase transitions between stationary but non - equilibrium states @xcite .    here",
    "we explore a model first proposed by two of us @xcite that unifies research in nonlinear quantum optics with spintronics . in the present work",
    ", we use that model to explore how bistability manifests itself in the quantum world .",
    "spintronics has emerged as a field in which the spin degrees of freedom of charge carriers in solid state devices are exploited for the purpose of information processing .",
    "manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom rather than the charge has the advantage of longer coherence and relaxation times since the spin is more weakly coupled to its environment @xcite . for the same reason ,",
    "manipulation of the spin of an electron is much harder than the charge and therefore has resulted in significant effort to come up with proposals for necessary spin devices including spin batteries , spin filters , spin transistors , etc ... much of this work has focused on ways to generate pure spin currents , @xmath2 , which are the result of an equal number of spin up ( @xmath3 ) and spin down ( @xmath4 ) charge carriers moving in the opposite direction so that the charge current , @xmath5 , is zero . here",
    ", @xmath6 are the spin polarized particle currents , @xmath7 the spin of the particle , and @xmath8 the charge .",
    "there currently exist numerous theoretical and experimental concepts for generating spin currents in semiconductor nanostructures including spin - orbit ( so ) interactions @xcite , optical absorption @xcite and raman scattering @xcite , as well as various types of quantum pumps @xcite .",
    "electron spin resonance ( esr ) between zeeman states in a quantum dot connected to leads is one of the proposed models for the generation of pure spin currents @xcite .",
    "according to this model , spin flips are the result of a transverse magnetic field that cause the spin direction of outgoing electrons to be opposite to those entering the dot .",
    "our model @xcite extends this idea to spin flips induced by raman transitions inside of an optical microcavity .",
    "one laser involved in the raman transition is a strong undepleted pump while the other is a mode of the cavity .",
    "inside of the cavity , both the feedback effect resulting from light `` bouncing '' back and forth numerous times in the cavity and quantum fluctuations can have a dramatic influence on the characteristics of the spin current . in our previous work @xcite , we considered the classical limit of a large number of dots , @xmath9 , interacting with the cavity mode such that quantum noise is negligible .",
    "when the cavity is driven by a laser , the system exhibits absorptive ob in the amplitude of the cavity field .",
    "because the spin current is a function of the cavity field amplitude , the spin current also exhibits bistability as function of the amplitude of the driving laser which survives even in the presence of significant variations in the dot sizes and coupling to the cavity field .    however , this bistability is a purely classical effect since a large number of dots collectively interact with the cavity mode like a single classical absorber .",
    "this begs the question of what happens if we consider only a _",
    "single _ quantum dot coupled to the cavity where quantum fluctuations will be so large as to imply that the two stable outputs lose their stability .",
    "earlier theoretical work in quantum optics that explored the limit of bistability for a single atom coupled to cavity mode found that the steady state phase space distribution of the cavity field had a bimodal structure indicative of two stationary values @xcite .",
    "these states are not however stable since quantum noise forces stochastic jumps between the two values @xcite . here",
    "we show that , while the average spin current for a single dot in a driven cavity does not exhibit bistability , the frequency dependent spin current shot noise does exhibit signatures of the two stationary cavity states since in this system the shot noise spectrum reflects the probability distribution for cavity photon states .",
    "in contrast to the mentioned work from quantum optics @xcite , which relied on quantum trajectory monte carlo simulations , we utilize a standard master equation to calculate the shot noise indicating that evidence of the quantum limit of bistability can be gleaned using more pedestrian techniques .    in section",
    "ii , we briefly review our model and introduce our mathematical formulation of the shot noise in terms of the dot+cavity master equation . in section iii ,",
    "we numerically study both the average spin current and the associated shot noise . in section iv , we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a self - assembled quantum dot embedded in a high - q microcavity , as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . we are interested in simultaneous coupling of a dot to a cavity mode and electrical transport through the dot due to tunneling from a doped reservoir .",
    "a number of experiments have already measured the conductance and shot noise through individual self - assembled quantum dots @xcite as well spectroscopy of exciton and charged exciton states in quantum dots with controllable charging from a doped lead @xcite .",
    "other experiments have demonstrated strong coupling of individual dots to a single optical microcavity mode @xcite .",

    "raman transitions between the dot zeeman states , @xmath24 , via an intermediate trion state , @xmath10 , are induced by a @xmath25 polarized laser with frequency @xmath11 and a linearly polarized cavity mode with frequency @xmath12 .",
    "several experiments have already demonstrated the use of raman scattering via an intermediate trion state to manipulate electron spin states in quantum dots @xcite and theoretically such processes have been studied inside of optical microcavities for use as a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 pump creates a @xmath27 heavy hole and an electron with spin down along the @xmath28 direction according to the hamiltonian , @xmath29 , which couples to the component of the dot zeeman states with spin up along @xmath28 yielding a trion state with an electron singlet .",
    "the @xmath26 component of the cavity field along with the pump leads to raman transitions via the intermediate @xmath10 state that flips the electron spin while the @xmath30 component gives rise to additional energy shifts due to the ac stark effect .",
    "when the two fields are far detuned by an amount @xmath13 from the creation energy for the @xmath10 state , the intermediate trion state can be adiabatically eliminated to give @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the photon annihilation operator for the cavity mode @xcite .",

    "1 , if an electron enters the dot in the spin @xmath3 state , a photon must be absorbed from the cavity mode and emitted into the pump in order to generate a spin current .",
    "it is therefore necessary to drive the cavity field .",

    "we first discuss the behaviour of the intracavity field as a function of the driving field amplitude , @xmath97 . the intracavity field can be readily visualized in term of the q - distribution @xcite for the cavity mode in the steady state as shown in fig .",
