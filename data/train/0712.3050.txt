    "the so - called vector chirality in quantum spin chains is defined as the vector product of two adjacent spins along the chain : @xmath2 in a chirally ordered state spins have a tendency to `` rotate '' in some preferred plane in a certain preferred direction ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) .",
    "chiral phases in quantum spin chains were predicted long ago @xcite and have attracted considerable interest recently @xcite after they have been found numerically in frustrated chains with easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "@xcite as noted by villain , @xcite the chiral order should survive at finite temperature in the presence of three - dimensional interactions without tranforming into a usual helical long - range order : at finite temperatures the chirality correlation length is much larger than the spin correlation length , so with decreasing temperature chiral order should set in before spin order does ; there are experimental indications that the chiral order may exist in the quasi - one - dimensional anisotropic organic magnet @xmath3.@xcite the projection of the vector chirality @xmath4 on the direction of the applied field could be experimentally detected with the help of polarized neutrons .",
    "@xcite    in all known cases of numerically confirmed existence of chiral states , the preferred plane for spin rotation is chosen by some anisotropy of the easy - plane type , and the chiral phase disappears in the isotropic limit.@xcite recently , it has been predicted @xcite that in isotropic frustrated chains the chiral phase may appear in presence of an external magnetic field , strong enough to close the spectral gap . in such a state ,",

    "an alternative two - component tll scenario @xcite assumes the existence of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid in both sectors and implies absence of the chiral order .",

    "for @xmath0 . however , both works focused only on the magnetization process and did not check the presence of the chiral order . the theoretical analysis of ref .",
    "involves some uncontrolled approximations ( mean - field decoupling of the `` twist '' term ) and , to our knowledge , the chiral order in isotropic spin chains has never been directly probed numerically ( the only exception being the calculation of short - range correlations in a @xmath1 chain @xcite ) , so the question of the correct scenario remains unsettled .",
    "several materials are known which realize isotropic zigzag spin chains ; @xcite among them , @xmath5 can be viewed as a promising candidate for experimental studies , since its small exchange constants make it feasible to reach magnetic fields comparable to the gap .    in this paper",
