    "this is a one dimensional tight binding model on a lattice , with nearest - neighbor hopping terms and on - site energies given by a combination of two periodic functions having non - commensurate wave numbers , which has been shown to display a metal - to - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between geometry and interaction in many - body systems can generate an impressive range of physical phenomena .",
    "for example , the ground state properties of interacting bosons , subject to a quasi - periodic potential , show a rich phase diagram at zero temperature  @xcite , displaying superfluid , bose - glass and mott insulator phases depending upon the filling of the lattice , the interactions and the strength of the potential .",
    "interestingly , a mobility edge ( me ) appears when an extension of the aa model is considered , allowing for longer - range hopping such as next - nearest - neighbor terms  @xcite or a continuous model ( infinite - range hopping)@xcite , or even interactions  @xcite .",
    "the extended - to - localized phase transition of the aa model , within the framework of many body physics , has been widely investigated both from a theoretical point of view  @xcite and also from an experimental perspective  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we ask how the presence of a me in the single particle problem affects many - body measurable quantities , and to what extent the latter can be used to detect it . to this aim",

    "optical lattices allow to create trapping potentials that are tight enough in the transversal direction to freeze out all dynamics in these degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "a gas of @xmath0 bosons in such a potential can then be approximated by the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath1        + g_{1d}\\sum_{i < j}\\delta(|x_i - x_j|)\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the mass of the particles , @xmath3 is the trapping potential and @xmath4 is a 1d coupling constant which is derived from the renormalisation of the three - dimensional scattering process , @xmath5 @xcite . here @xmath6 is the trap width and @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "this hamiltonian describes an inhomogeneous lieb - liniger gas , which in the strongly repulsive limit , @xmath8 , can be solved by using a mapping to an ideal and spinless fermionic system @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of this mapping is that one can then treat the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tg_ham ] ) by replacing it with a boundary condition on the allowed bosonic wave - function @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is the hard core constraint , which says that no probability exists for two particles ever to be at the same point in space .",
    "such a constraint is automatically fulfilled by calculating the wave - function using a slater determinant @xmath12 where the @xmath13 are the single particle eigenstates of the ideal system .",
    "this , however , leads to a fermionic rather than bosonic symmetry , which can be corrected by a multiplication with the appropriate unit antisymmetric function  @xcite @xmath14 to give @xmath15 .",
    "once the single particle eigenstates of the system in the external potential of interest are known then the many - body properties of both the free fermionic and hard - core bosonic systems can be investigated .",

    "@xmath22 is the recoil energy , giving an estimation of the energy at which the potential with modulation @xmath23 opens the first gap of width @xmath24 in the otherwise gapless free particle spectrum ( for @xmath25 ) .",
    "the above condition therefore ensures that all particles with energy @xmath26 do not have enough energy to overcome the first gap and , therefore , that they are confined in the lowest band of the potential . in this limit ,",
    "the properties of the system are dominated by the external potential and it is possible to rewrite the single particle hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch ] ) in terms of states @xmath27 , localized around the minima of the potential , whose wave functions @xmath28 are the so called wannier functions . in the presence of the second potential @xmath29 , and in the tb limit , the continuum model described by eq .",

    "both @xmath31 and @xmath32 depend upon the choice of the set of wannier functions , which in turn depend upon the first potential only if the condition @xmath33 is satisfied .",
    "the aa model has been widely studied from different points of view . for what we are concerned here",
    ", it is worth recalling that the aa model shows a delocalized - to - localized ( or metal - to - insulator ) transition at @xmath34 .",
    "this point marks the change from a delocalized phase ( @xmath35 ) , in which all of the eigenstates have an extended character with a corresponding absolutely continuous spectrum , to a phase where all states are localized and the spectrum is discrete  @xcite . as for the many - body properties of this system , it has been predicted numerically and verified experimentally that bosons with the addition of on - site interaction in the aa model enjoy a particularly rich phase diagram , which includes a superfluid to bose - glass transition at low filling , and also a mott insulator phase for higher filling and interaction strength .    in the continuum , outside the range of validity of the tb approximation , it is known that the sharp delocalized - to - localized transition of the lowest energy band transforms into a mobility edge , whose position in energy changes with @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to study in detail how this crossover from the discrete to the continuum behavior occurs , and to show that signatures of this transition are displayed in the many - body properties of both non - interacting fermions and strongly - interacting bosons .",
    "we will therefore always work with the continuous model of eq .   and move from the discrete to the continuous limits by changing the strength of the main potential @xmath23 . for each set of parameters @xmath37",
    "we have numerically solved the eigenvalue problem given by eq .   via a fifth order matrix numerov method @xcite , considering systems with @xmath38 lattice sites and total length @xmath39 .      in the discrete model , all of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian of eq .   in the tb regime",
    "are either extended or localized , depending on wether the value of @xmath36 is below or above a certain characteristic value @xmath40 . on the other hand , if @xmath41 a mobility edge ( me ) appears such that , for a fixed value of @xmath36 , states with energy lower then the me are localized whilst the others are delocalized @xcite .",
    "the me is found at higher energies for increasing @xmath36 .",
    "it is possible to obtain an estimation of the localization threshold @xmath40 by calculating explicitly @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the aa model  as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath36  and inverting the condition @xmath42 , by solving for @xmath36 . using the numerical estimations given in @xcite , we have obtained @xmath43 in the following we will use the rescaled quantity @xmath44 in order to compare systems with different @xmath23 and @xmath36",
    "this guarantees that the transition point in the tb limit always occurs at @xmath45 .",
    "however , it is important to notice that the computation of @xmath40 has been done , and it is meaningful only in the tb limit .",
    "as we will also consider parameters for which the tb approximation does not hold , then the value @xmath45 will lose its importance and its role of transition point . to quantitatively discuss the transition in the general case , we will employ the inverse participation ratio @xmath46 for the eigenfunctions of the first energy band of the hamiltonian .",
    "this quantity measures the inverse of the average spatial region occupied by the eigenfunction .",
    "we will consider an eigenfunction to be localized if its ipr is larger than @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the distance between two neighbor lattice sites .",
    "[ fig : nloc ] shows the number of localized states as a function of @xmath36 for different values of @xmath23 : in the tb regime ( upper , red curve ) the transition is sharp , whereas in the continuum there is an me , as witnessed by the plateaux in fig .",
    "[ fig : nloc ] , that correspond to gaps inside the first energy band . moreover , as anticipated above , fig .",
    "[ fig : nloc ] shows that the estimation of the transition point @xmath49 given in eq .   fails when the tb description does not provide a good approximation ( see ,",
    "e.g. the lower curve , corresponding to @xmath50 ) .",
    "we finally show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ipr3 ] the @xmath51 of the ground state wave function , normalized to one lattice length , together with the function itself and its its fourier transform for various values of @xmath52 .     for different values of @xmath23 .",

    "it is known that the excitation spectrum of the tonks - girardeau model is the same as that of non - interacting spinless fermions and that all local quantities are the same for the two systems . on the other hand , non local quantities , such as the momentum distribution , are different and reveal the fermionic and bosonic nature of the two systems .",
    "more importantly , we shall see that the different statistical nature of the two kind of particles also shows up in the way the localization transition and the appearance of the me manifest themselves in the momentum distributions .",
    "in this section , we consider the effect of the me of the single - particle spectrum on the ground state properties of a system of @xmath0 non - interacting fermions loaded into the bichromatic lattice , and , more generally , discuss the signatures of the transition from discrete to continuum , occurring as @xmath23 is decreased .",
    "the many - body wavefunction describing a system of @xmath0 non - interacting spinless fermions is given by a slater determinant of single particle states ( see eq .  ) .",
    "below , we focus on the reduced single particle density matrix ( rspdm ) @xmath58 whose knowledge is sufficient to evaluate the expectation values of all single - particle operators .",
    "its fourier transform gives the momentum distribution ( md ) , @xmath59 which is directly measurable in cold atom experiments .",
    "the eigenfunctions ( @xmath60 ) and eigenvalues ( @xmath61 ) of the rspdm , defined by @xmath62 , and normalized such that @xmath63 , are the so called _ natural orbitals _ and their populations , respectively . for a non - interacting fermi gas ,",
    "as one could have expected , there are only @xmath0 non - vanishing eigenvalues , which are all equal to one , and the corresponding eigenvectors coincide with the first @xmath0 lowest single particle energy states . a similar analysis for a tonk - girardeau gas will prove to be much less trivial .",
    "the rspdm and md of a non - interacting fermion gas in its ground many - body state can be expressed via the single particle energy eigenstates : @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fourier transform of @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we analyze the tb limit first , where , interestingly enough , the md offers a signature of the localization transition inherited from the single particle properties . on the delocalized side , the fourier transform of each single particle state displays peaks at the wave numbers @xmath68 with @xmath69 , and the md shows several fermi - dirac - like flat structures due to the occupation of states with nearby momentum peaks .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momdisttb ] , where explicit reference to gases of @xmath70 and @xmath71 fermions is made . in the delocalized region ( @xmath72 ) , indeed , some nearly flat regions appear in the md .",
    "they are centered at different @xmath73 s , and are due to the fact that each single particle wavefuction contributes with at least two momenta ( but in general more , for higher energy states ) ; these momenta pile up in the total @xmath74 to give a sequence of nearby peaks forming these fermi - dirac - like ( almost ) flat regions , whose width is proportional to the number of particles .    on the other hand , again in the tb regime , but now in the localized domain , the md suddenly smoothens for @xmath75 , due to the fact that single particle states are all localized , so that their fourier transform flattens over in momentum space . before shifting our attention to the continuum case , it is instructive to discuss the nature and origin of the structures that appear at the edges of the flat regions .",
    "they are particularly well visible in the case of @xmath71 .",
    "conversely , for @xmath70 , they only show up as small peaks , whose height increases with increasing @xmath52 until the transition point @xmath45 is reached , where they disappear leaving structure - less bumps .    to understand why this happens",
    ", we recall that the addition of the second potential leads to a fragmentation of the energy spectrum into sub - bands separated by gaps whose width depends , at first order in a perturbation analysis , on the amplitudes of the fourier transform of the potential itself .",
    "furthermore , the sub - bands tend to flatten out as the potential is increased .",
    "this implies that the density of states increases at the sub - band edges and more particles can be accommodated there . as a result ,",
    "the structures at the edges of the flat regions become better and better defined as the number of particles increases .     as a function of @xmath52 for a system of non - interacting fermions with @xmath76 ( tb limit ) .",
    "the two panels refer to a different number of fermions : a ) n=15 and b ) n=65 .",
    "blue and red curves are for @xmath72 and @xmath75 respectively.,width=264 ]    in the continuum , namely @xmath77 , the delocalized - to - localized transition turns into the appearance of an me . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : momdistcnt ] b ) shows that it is possible to observe structures in the md of an @xmath71 fermion gas at any value of @xmath52 , and in particular well beyond the transition point @xmath45 , which used to mark a sharp transition in the tb approximation .",
    "the persistence of such structures is a signature of the existence of occupied single particle states , which remain delocalized beyond @xmath45 .",
    "however , this seems not to be the case if one looks at fig .",
    "[ fig : momdistcnt ] a ) , where @xmath74 is shown for @xmath70 fermions , instead . here , the structures of the md quickly disappear when increasing @xmath52 beyond @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , as we considered a smaller number of fermions in this case , less states are occupied , and all of them become localized for @xmath79 ( giving rise to a quick smoothing of @xmath74 ) . the comparison between fig .",
    "[ fig : momdistcnt ] a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : momdistcnt ] b ) , therefore , shows that , in the same band , there exist both localized single particle states ( at low energy ) and delocalized ones ( at higher energy ) , which is a clear manifestation of the me .     as a function of @xmath52 for a system of non - interacting fermions with @xmath76 . the same parameters and coloring as fig .",
    "[ fig : momdisttb ] is used .",
    "a persistence of the edge - structures well beyond @xmath45 is observed for @xmath71 , but not for @xmath70 as , for these parameters , the first @xmath80 single particle states remain below the me.,width=264 ]    in order to characterize quantitatively this phenomenon , we resort to an approach already used in ref.@xcite to study the degree of delocalization of phonon modes in quasi - crystalline structures . the idea behind it is to evaluate the area under the md peaks , in order to quantify the total power spectrum coming from coherent sources , which in our case correspond to delocalized single particle states .",
    "therefore , we have evaluated the total area @xmath81 below the edge - peaks in @xmath74 after removing the background . on the delocalized side ( @xmath72 ) @xmath81 increases as a function of @xmath52 due to the appearance of new peaks , induced in the single particle states by the second potential , when the transition point is approached . moreover , for small numbers of fermions ( @xmath82 ) such an increase is approximately linear , up until saturation is reached .",
    "this behavior stems from the fact that only the lower energy eigenstates are occupied and , therefore , large values of the second potential are needed to make them develop a spatial structure , which involves more momenta .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath83 , saturation occurs well before , due to the fact that higher energy eigenstates are occupied even at small values of @xmath52 , which contribute to @xmath74 with more momenta and , therefore , more peaks .",
    "when the localized eigenstates start to be occupied , @xmath81 decreases due to the smoothing of the md profile . in the tb - regime",
    ", @xmath81 suddenly goes to zero for @xmath84 , regardless of the number of fermions , as all of the eigenstates suddenly localize . on the other hand , in the continuous limit with @xmath85",
    ", we observe the appearance of an me as @xmath81 decreases for @xmath84 and reaches a plateaux ( blue and yellow curves in fig .",

    "in sec.[sec : fermions ] we have seen that signatures of the me appear in the momentum distribution of the the rspdm of a many - body system of spinless fermions . in this section",
    "we look at a strongly - interacting boson gas ( i.e. , the tonks - girardeau gas ) , whose ground state properties can be related to the fermionic ones via the prescription outlined in sec.[sect : tggas ] .",
    "the many body spectrum of an hard - core boson system is , in fact , the same as that of the noninteracting fermion gas , loaded into the same optical potential @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show that the mapping from hard - core bosons to non - interacting fermions leaves all _ local _ quantities unchanged ; for instance , given the many - body wavefunction for @xmath0 hard - core bosons , the density of bosons is the same as that of @xmath0 non interacting fermions .",
    "conversely , non - local properties , such as correlation functions , are different in the two cases .",
    "for this reason we expect the md , which is derived from the off - diagonal entries of the rspdm , to be markedly different from that observed in sec.[sec : fermions ] , because of the presence of spatial coherences , typical of a boson gas .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the rspdm of @xmath0 hard - core bosons can be obtained by the single particle eigenstates of the equivalent non - interacting fermion problem as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and the @xmath91 matrix @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 .",

    "the particles would tend to occupy the single particle modes with lowest energy . on the other hand , due to the very strong repulsion between two bosons when their spatial overlap is large ,",
    "particles tend to occupy states in order to lower their overlap .",
    "the interplay between these two effects is the key mechanism that explains the behavior of the md for strongly interacting bosons , which we will now analyze .     as a function of @xmath52 for a system of strongly - interacting bosons with @xmath76 ( tb limit ) .",

    "this is clearly visible in the momentum distribution of the system and in the entropy of the reduced single particle density matrix .",
    "moreover in the case of bosons we have shown that the interaction plays a key role in the localization properties of the system .",

    "<S> we explore the ground state properties of cold atomic gases , loaded into a bichromatic lattice , focusing on the cases of non - interacting fermions and hard - core ( tonks - girardeau ) bosons , trapped by the combination of two potentials with incommensurate periods . for such systems , two limiting cases have been thoroughly established . in the tight - binding limit </S>",
    "<S> , the single - particle states in the lowest occupied band show a localization transition , as the strength of the second potential is increased above a certain threshold . in the continuous limit , </S>",
    "<S> when the tight - binding approximation does not hold anymore , a mobility edge is found , whose position in energy depends upon the strength of the second potential . here , </S>",
    "<S> we study how the crossover from the discrete to the continuum behavior occurs , and prove that signatures of the localization transition and mobility edge clearly appear in the generic many - body properties of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we evaluate the momentum distribution , which is a routinely measured quantity in experiments with cold atoms , and demonstrate that , even in the presence of strong boson - boson interactions , the single particle mobility edge can be observed in the ground state properties . </S>"
