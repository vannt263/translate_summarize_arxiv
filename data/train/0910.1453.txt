    "all pulsars show a remarkable uniformity of rotation rate on a time scale of a few days as expected of an isolated spinning body with large stable moment of inertia .",
    "@xcite the angular momentum of radio pulsar is slowly decreasing through slowdown torque of the magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "however , some very interesting irregularities in pulsar rotation have been observed which are termed as _",
    "timing noise_.    it is anticipated that valuable information of many interesting physical processes related to pulsars is coded in the timing noises , thus employing statistical measures to characterize timing noises is important to the study of pulsars and thus the properties of the matter at supra - nuclear densities .",
    "efforts to quantify timing noise have been tried as early as timing noise was firstly recognized , for instance according to random walk of different quantities @xcite , most current models such as vortex creeping are still restricted to treatment of timing noise only as random process in certain quantities .",
    "one exception was presented by @xcite , who analyzed timing data of vela pulsar to look for evidence of chaotic behavior by `` correlation sum '' technique to estimate fractal dimension of the system . however , despite possible suggestions they concluded that `` correlation sum '' estimator may be unable to distinguish between random and chaotic processes .    however , any statistical representation of data has their own biases , employing a large types of statistical measures is essentially vital to a fair understanding of the timing noises .",
    "furthermore , the number of observed pulsars has accumulated to @xmath2 @xcite but collected data is often incomplete for a conclusive analysis , it is therefore crucial to diagnose current available but limited data , the results of which could guide us in future observation to concentrate on those pulsars with anomalous timing noise . here",
    "we are introducing a statistical method rarely used in time domain astronomy  the hurst parameter analysis , which is actually sensitive to the type of the inherent correlation among the time series .",
    "our practical analysis of the timing data observed by the 25-meter radio telescope at urumqi observatory of @xmath0 pulsars indicates that hurst parameter analysis might be capable of detecting anomalous signals which disguise themselves as noises .",
    "the timing noise in essence is a discrete realization of a continuous random process @xmath3 , let @xmath4 be a discrete time series sampled sequentially at time points @xmath5 and the task is to analyze the record @xmath6 and identify corresponding characteristics of @xmath3 .",
    "the first property one may check is whether there is correlation among the series .",
    "the most commonplace time series is the _ independently distributed random series _ if the covariance @xmath7 for any @xmath8 . the independently distributed random series is also the well known as _ white noise _ for its constant power spectrum .",
    "a closely related concept is the colored noises which are called so for their power - law shaped power spectrum @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "another important aspect is stationarity .",
    "stationary means that for any @xmath11 indices @xmath12 the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 have the same n - point distribution @xcite . to ensure the stationarity",
    ", one can either enlarge the observation window to have sufficiently long record of data to include the short - term variation , or construct a new set of data by de - trending the observed time series with appropriate models .",
    "if for the new series that sums @xmath15 consecutive variable @xmath16 , there exists a scaling function @xmath17 so that for any @xmath11 indices @xmath12 the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath18 have the same n - point distribution , we call the time series _ self - similar_. @xcite self - similar time series thus looks the same after scaling up to a factor @xmath17 while @xmath15 plays the role of resolution .",
    "if for self - similar series the function @xmath17 obeys power law @xmath19 , we call the series a self - similar series with a _ hurst parameter _ of @xmath20 .",
    "it is obvious that an independently and identically distributed gaussian series is self - similar with hurst parameter @xmath21 .",
    "but once the series has some non - trivial correlation structures , the hurst parameter may differ from @xmath22 , which is better illustrated with the following introduction of hurst parameter @xcite for continuous - time stochastic process .",
    "if @xmath23 is a random process on some probability space such that :    1 .   with probability 1 , @xmath23 is continuous and @xmath24 ; 2 .   for any @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", the increment @xmath27 follows a normal distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath28 , so that @xmath29    the parameter @xmath20 is then the hurst parameter ( or hurst exponent ) , if @xmath21 , the random process is just the i.i.d gaussian random process ( c.f .",
    "it is easy to see that the correlation @xmath30 \\rangle = \\frac { ( t+\\tau)^{2\\alpha}-t^{2\\alpha}-\\tau^{2\\alpha}}{2 } \\label{eq : corr}\\ ] ] does not vanish unless @xmath21 .",
    "random walk can be formed from a random process @xmath31 via @xmath32 or @xmath33 , the random walk with pace length drawn from i.i.d gaussian series is the normal brownian motion while those walks coming from eq .",
    "[ eq : hdef ] with @xmath34 and @xmath35 is named _ fractional brownian motion_. as can be seen from eq.[eq : corr ] , a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath36 contains a positive correlation between consecutive steps or in other words a persistent trend , and covers wider range than normal brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "for series with @xmath37 the generated random walk will cover less than brownian motion , implying a negative correlation between consecutive variables or in other words a self - reverting trend , i.e. being _ anti - persistent_. therefore , estimation of hurst parameter can probe correlation inside the series , i.e. how the ` memory ' of its past affects the future .",
    "the method was named after its proposer h. hurst  @xcite , and has been widely used in various areas such as biology , medical science , seismology , and economics .",
    "our algorithm is a slightly modified version of the popular range over standard deviation ( ros ) algorithm  @xcite to account for the non - uniform sampling .",
    "the timing noise record @xmath38 taken at time @xmath39 , is firstly split into @xmath40 segments of length @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 is re - grouped in the way @xmath43 so that @xmath44 for @xmath45-th segment @xmath46 for example , we calculate average @xmath47 and standard deviation @xmath48 of the record @xmath49 to form a new series @xmath50 whose element is given by @xmath51 the _ range _ @xmath52 is defined to be the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the accumulated series , @xmath53 where superscript @xmath40 is the number of segments , and for each @xmath40 there is an averaged range @xmath54 therefore for @xmath55 we obtain a sequence @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is chosen so to be the largest segment number to ensure that every segment contain at least @xmath58 data points . to estimate the power - law index we then use linear regression to fit @xmath59 for the slope as estimation of the hurst parameter @xmath20 .      however there",
    "two complications in practical estimation of hurst parameter of timing residual data :    1 .",
    "the algorithm is for series of exact values while for timing noise looks like white noise , uncertainties are usually not negligible . 2 .",
    "the algorithm uses running maximum while the definition uses variance .",
    "these two should show the same trend in @xmath60 limit @xcite but there is no information to what extend this is true for finite sequence .",
    "in order to control possible systematical effects , we carry out numerical test with simple simulations . for pseudo - random number generator  @xcite . ]",
    "we generate @xmath61 series @xmath62 for each pulsar to take error bar effect into account where @xmath40 labels data points number and in each sequence @xmath63 follows the gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to data error bar lengths and expectation equal to the centers of data error bar .",
    "then hurst parameters @xmath20 of these series and their average and standard deviation is calculated for each pulsar .",
    "next we generate artificial ( anti-)persistent series @xmath64 with constant covariance @xmath65 between consecutive pair at observation times @xmath66 in order to control systematic error from finite length .",
    "in other words , we generate a gaussian random number @xmath67 at @xmath68 , then with the value of @xmath69 we generate independent random number @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and so forth for the rest of @xmath72 there is the @xmath73 where @xmath65 is clearly the constant covariance between consecutive numbers .",
    "then we estimate the hurst parameter @xmath74 for each of these series @xmath75 .",
    "these values would serve as a standard for us to compare with @xmath20 obtained above .",
    "note that these series is self - similar but do not have power - law scaling function and therefore do not have a strictly defined hurst parameter .",
    "this can be shown by a simple calculation .",
    "given an i.i.d .",
    "series with standard gaussian distribution @xmath76 , the process with covariance @xmath65 can be expressed as @xmath77 and variance of sum of first @xmath40 variables is @xmath78 with @xmath79 hence its scaling function is @xmath80 clearly it is not power - law except for @xmath81 which leads to @xmath82 .",
    "however , we can still use linear regression to find slope @xmath83 of the log - log curve of @xmath84 which gives @xmath85 for @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath86 , @xmath89 .",
    "thus these series can simulate ( anti-)persistent series with short length . for",
    "long length series with @xmath90 , @xmath84 will quickly approach @xmath91 as @xmath92 , in other word @xmath21 in the large @xmath40 limit .",
    "this simply calculation also demonstrates that hurst parameter deviation from @xmath22 seen in long series can not be attributed only to covariance between only consecutive pairs but reveals long - range dependence which is an essential feature of fractional brownian motion .",
    "data used in this work is @xmath1 years of timing residual data from 25 m radio telescope at urumqi observatory .",
    "timing data is processed using standard pulsar software packages psrchive @xcite and tempo2 @xcite to obtain timing residual .",
    "time of arrival ( toa ) of radio pulse is fitted using psrchive software from observation data by an input accumulated pulse profile .",
    "tempo2 software use coordinate system conversion parameters that account for various effects ( roemer delay , einstein delay , shapiro delay etc . ) and pulsar parameters ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 etc . ) to establish a model to predict arrival time of pulses .",
    "timing residual is obtained as difference between observation and this timing model .",
    "we then use splk package of tempo2 to output timing residual with error bar in unit of second at each toa .",
    "we select @xmath0 pulsars among pulsars regularly monitored at nanshan with no intention to be make our selection statistically representative . because of the nature of our analysis method",
    ", we mainly select pulsars with small @xmath94 and timing noise like white - noise without recognizable glitch . a list of these pulsars with various parameters ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , dispersion measure and characteristic age @xmath95 ) from the atnf pulsar database  @xcite is presented table [ tab_atnf ] .      using the above methods , hurst parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 with @xmath98 for @xmath0 radio pulsars",
    "are calculated .",
    "average values and standard deviations of these two groups of hurst parameters are listed in table [ tab_h ] together with basic parameters of @xmath0 pulsars .",
    "distribution of average @xmath99 is shown in figure [ fig_1 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig_2 ] , we plot average value and standard deviation of @xmath96 for each pulsar as a black error bar and in comparison average and standard deviation of @xmath97 for artificial ( anti-)persistent series with @xmath100 and i.i.d .",
    "series with @xmath81 are plotted as connected error bar bands . for clarity",
    "we do not show bands of artificial ( anti-)persistent series with @xmath101 which roughly fall in the gaps between @xmath81 and @xmath100 but have some overlap .    from the average and standard deviation of hurst parameters of the three bands shown in figure [ fig_2 ]",
    ", we see that data length and non - uniformity has only limited effect on the hurst parameter estimation .",
    "the values of hurst parameters of the three groups of artificial series are not exactly the same with hurst parameters calculated using variance in  [ sec_mc ] .",
    "this can be attributed to the difference between calculation by definition and our algorithm using running maximum as mentioned in  [ sec_mc ] .",
    "all @xmath20 values are in the interval @xmath102 . ]",
    "the black error bar shows average and standard deviation of @xmath103 hurst parameter value for each pulsar . in comparison artificial ( anti-)persistent series with constant covariance @xmath104",
    "are plotted as bands of connected error bars represented by increasing gray level . ]    from these results , we can see that most hurst parameters for pulsar timing noises concentrate around @xmath105 .",
    "however there are a small portion with @xmath20 values far away from @xmath105 despite considerable data point number . for psrs",

    "we calculated hurst parameter of @xmath0 radio pulsars with white - noise - like timing residual obtained from nanshan telescope and compared the results with artificial ( anti-)persistent series .",
    "the majority of pulsars from our selection have hurst parameters around @xmath105 and not far from hurst parameter calculated for independent series .",
    "however , we found 9 pulsars ( psrs j0147@xmath1065922 , j0357@xmath1065236 , j0612@xmath1063721 , j0630@xmath1072834 , j0823@xmath1060159 and j0837@xmath1074135 showing persistent trend and psrs j0055@xmath1065117 , j1022@xmath1061001 , and j1842@xmath1070359 showing anti - persistent trend ) with interesting @xmath20 values despite having white - noise - like timing residual .",
    "comparison with artificial series confirm that these trends can not be attributed entirely to effects caused by ros algorithm or large uncertainty in timing residual .",
    "this shows that our algorithm may be capable of detecting hidden correlation in apparently noise - like timing residual .",
    "we therefore suggest that these 9 pulsars be monitored continuously to confirm or disprove long - range dependence and search for possible physical process behind such correlation .    as for the selection",
    ", we picked @xmath0 pulsars with relatively small period derivative @xmath94 , and white - noise - like timing residual rather than the typical red - noise pattern of the three kind of noise model ( pn , fn and sn ) first proposed by boynton et al .",
    "( 1972 ) and of course we made no attempt at doing correlation between hurst parameter and other pulsar properties nor obtaining statistics of hurst parameter values for large population .",
    "our method is aimed at finding possibility that timing noise that resembles white - noise is not really generated by a random process .",
    "as is well known there are pulsars with smooth timing noise that differ largely from white noise ( such as j0332 + 5434 , j0406 + 6138 , j0826 + 2637 , etc . )",
    "and they would yields quite large hurst parameter if calculated using our algorithm and some even exceed @xmath118 . in that case",
    "we do not need the deviation from @xmath105 to conclude the obvious dependent nature of timing noise and other method should be used to analyze possible chaotic nature of these timing noise series .",
    "there are various physical processes that might be responsible for the long - range dependence of pulsar timing noise .",
    "these can be classified into three groups : from interior of neutron star , i.e. due to fluctuation of internal ( e.g. micro - quake due to partial release of elastic energy @xcite and random pinning and unpinning of vortex lines @xcite , @xcite ) and external ( e.g. accretion flow @xcite ) torques ; from emission process ( e.g. magnetosphere activities @xcite ) and from propagation of radio emission . for the last class of origin , it has long been proposed that timing noise can be used to set upper limits on gravitational wave ( @xcite ) and that given enough time pulsar timing array might be the first equipment to directly detect gravitational wave ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of these ( including gravitational wave detection which aims at detecting random background ) predict randomness in evolution of certain quantity while hurst parameter is capable of uncovering chaotic behavior that is hidden in timing noise .",
    "the physical origin that leads to dependence series is much more limited than random fluctuations .",
    "therefore , long - term dependence detected by hurst parameter might reveal more detailed information about the physical origin of timing noise .",
    "for instance it has been proposed that under certain conditions euler equations for rotating object with magnetic dipole moment misaligned with rotation axis would show chaotic spin - down behavior ( see @xcite ) . by definition",
    "any dynamical process can exhibit chaotic behavior and thus dependence in long - term timing noise data if the system is governed by differential equations whose solution is highly sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "we expect that the application of hurst parameter to timing noise of longer time span reveal more evidence for new physics .",
    "we would like to acknowledge useful discussions at our pulsar group of pku .",
