    "<S> by extending the lepton sector of standard model to include one sterile neutrino and two sets of new higgs doublets and right - handed neutrinos , denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with two @xmath2 symmetries , the puzzles of neutrino masses , matter - antimatter asymmetry and cosmic - ray excess observed by fermi - lat and pamela can be resolved simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the characters of the model are : ( a ) neutrino masses arise from type - i and radiative seesaw mechanisms ; ( b ) leptogenesis leading to baryon asymmetry at the energy scale of @xmath3 could be realized through soft @xmath2 symmetry breaking effects ; and ( c ) the conditions of small couplings for a long - lived dark matter could be achieved naturally through loop corrections due to the same soft symmetry breaking effects . </S>",
    "<S> the candidate for dark matter in leptophilic decays could fit the fermi - lat and pamela data well .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the strongest motivations for new physics is due to the unsolvable problems in the standard model ( sm ) , such as the origin of neutrino masses , matter - antimatter asymmetry and dark matter , which are the phenomena observed well , but less understood . </S>",
    "<S> recently , three astonishing experiments pamela  @xcite , atic  @xcite and fermi - lat @xcite in cosmic - ray measurements reheated the issue of the unknown stuff , in which the first one indicates anomaly in positron flux ratio while the later two observe excess in electron+positron ( @xmath4 ) flux . </S>",
    "<S> although fermi - lat s results do nt display the bump as shown at atic in the @xmath5 flux , a clear excess at fermi with high precision can not be denied . </S>",
    "<S> promptly , it is proposed that one of possible resources for generating the exotic events in the flux of electrons and positrons is ascribed to the dark matter annihilations and/or decays @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> pamela observes not only on the positron flux ratio but also on the antiproton flux ratio , however , the resulting evidences show no significant excess on the latter . accordingly , </S>",
    "<S> if the excess observed at fermi and pamela stems from the dark matter , the dark stuff should presumably be leptophilic . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the matter - antimatter asymmetry arises from the so - called leptogenesis where the baryon asymmetry originates from the lepton asymmetry @xcite , the issues of neutrino masses , baryon asymmetry and fermi / pamela puzzles intriguingly are all related to the lepton sector . based on this inference , it is interesting to investigate how these unsolved problems can be explained within a simple model uniformly .    </S>",
    "<S> although dark matter annihilations could provide the source for the fermi / pamela anomalies , it is inevitable that an enhanced boost factor of a few orders of magnitude , such as sommerfeld enhancement @xcite , near - threshold resonances and dark - onium formation @xcite , has to be introduced . </S>",
    "<S> to evade of introducing unnecessary effects , we will focus on the mechanism of dark matter decays . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to get a long - lived dark matter , say @xmath6 , usually we have to fine - tune either the new couplings to be tiny or the new scale in intermediated state to be as large as the scale of grand unified theories ( guts ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in order to fulfill our purpose , the subject we face is not only how the model provides a new cp violating ( cpv ) mechanism in the lepton sector so that lepton number asymmetry could be converted to the baryon asymmetry by the nonperturbative sphalerons @xcite , but also how a long - lived dark matter exists naturally while solving fermi / pamela anomalies .    to solve the mentioned problems , we extend the sm by including two extra higgs doublets @xmath7 ( i=1,2 ) with hypercharge @xmath8 and five right - handed neutrinos denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 . besides </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce two @xmath2 discrete symmetries so that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are transformed by _ 1-_1 ,  n_1,3-n_1,3 , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 follow _ 2-_2 ,  n_2,4-n_2,4 under the first and second @xmath2 symmetry , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the unmentioned fields in above equations denote invariance in each transformation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath15 do not have vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) when the discrete symmetries are exact . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the yukawa sector could be found as -l_y & = & |l_i y^e_ij _ jr + |l_j y^n_j h n + |l_i y_i _ 1 n _ + & & + |l_i y_i _ 2 n_+ n^t c n + & & + ^4_k=1 n^t_k c n_k + h.c . , [ eq : yukawa ] where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17 doublet leptons , @xmath18 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand for the yukawa couplings . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen @xmath24 as the diagonalized states before the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . since the right - handed neutrino @xmath10 directly couples to the sm higgs and ordinary leptons , the masses of neutrinos could be induced after the ewsb . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath10 could lead to non - zero neutrino masses by the type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite , i.e. , we have to set @xmath25 . moreover , because of interactions associated with charged leptons being @xmath26 , in order to explain the fermi / pamela data , the decaying dark matter should be the fermionic particle . here , we take @xmath27 as the candidate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the mass relations are required to obey @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we will see clearly later that if @xmath30 , the role of @xmath31 is responsible to the leptonic cp asymmetry ( cpa ) in leptogenesis .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath27 is protected by the @xmath2-symmetry and the decay is forbidden by kinematics , so far it is still a stable particle . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are allowed kinematically to decay through the channels @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . in order to make the dark matter unstable </S>",
    "<S> , we ascribe that the origin of the unstable dark matter is from the @xmath2 soft breaking terms , given by -l_soft=_34 n^t_3 c n_4 + h.c . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : soft ] due to the soft breaking effects being associated with heavier right - handed neutrinos , it is clear that although @xmath2 symmetries have been broken , the breaking effects will not open a sizable decaying channel for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the unstable dark matter could be a long - lived one .    </S>",
    "<S> we now start to discuss in turn how the puzzles of small neutrino masses , baryon asymmetry and fermi - lat / pamela are solved in this model . </S>",
    "<S> + _ * neutrino masses * _ : by the first term of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the masses of neutrinos could be also induced by radiative corrections in which the corresponding feynman diagram is illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath45 tev , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the neutrino mass by the dominant effects could be @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , if we combine the type - i and radiative seesaw mechanisms together , it is found that some cancelations could occur between both . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the constraint on the couplings of @xmath50 and @xmath51 could be somewhat relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the @xmath52ev resulted in each seesaw mechanism can be reduced to @xmath53 by the cancelations .    </S>",
    "<S> _ * leptogenesis * _ : since @xmath32 plays the role of the lepton asymmetry at the energy scale of @xmath54 , to satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition , the decay rate of @xmath32 should be less than the hubble constant h at the temperature of @xmath55 , given by @xcite _ </S>",
    "<S> n_3 < h(t = m_n_3)=    active degrees of freedom and @xmath56 gev is the planck scale . as mentioned early , @xmath32 could decay via the three - body channel of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we check that by the phase space suppression and with @xmath58 , the rate for the three - body decay is around a factor of 5 smaller than hubble constant . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by the soft breaking effects of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : soft ] ) , @xmath32 will decay to @xmath59 through the mixing with @xmath33 , sketched by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lepto](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rate will depend on the parameters of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . by calculating the two - body decay rate of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lepto](b ) and with @xmath63 tev , the constraint on the parameters is |y_i4|<510 ^ -7 ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : mu34 ] by employing small @xmath64 , the decay rate less than the hubble constant for @xmath32 of @xmath65 can be naturally accomplished .    </S>",
    "<S> another necessary condition to achieve baryon asymmetry is the cpa , defined by a_cp&= & . </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero direct cpa should involve cpv and cp conserving ( cpc ) phases simultaneously . here , the complex yukawa couplings @xmath66 can provide the new cpv source . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we need a new mechanism to generate the physical cpc phase . </S>",
    "<S> it has been well known that one - loop effects could produce the cpc phase when the on - shell condition of particle in the internal loop is satisfied . in the model </S>",
