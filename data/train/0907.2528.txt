    "<S> recent molecular dynamic simulations have found chiral single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) twist during stretching , which is similar to the motion of a screw . </S>",
    "<S> obviously this phenomenon , as a type of curvature - chirality effect , can not be explained by usual isotropic elastic theory of swnt . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , with larger axial strains ( before buckling ) , the axial strain induced torsion ( a - sit ) shows asymmetric behaviors for axial tensile and compressing strains , which suggests anharmonic elasticity of swnts plays an important role in real a - sit responses . in order to study the a - sit of chiral swnts with actual sizes , and avoid possible deviations of computer simulation results due to the finite - size effect , we propose a @xmath0d analytical continuum model which can be used to describe the the swnts of arbitrary chiralities , curvatures , and lengthes , with the concerning of anisotropic and anharmonic elasticity of swnts . </S>",
    "<S> this elastic energy of present model comes from the continuum limit of lattice energy based on second generation reactive empirical bond order potential ( rebo - ii ) , a well - established empirical potential for solid carbons . </S>",
    "<S> our model has no adjustable parameters , except for those presented in rebo - ii , and all the coefficients in the model can be calculated analytically . using our method , we obtain a - sit responses of chiral swnts with arbitrary radius , chiralities and lengthes . </S>",

    "<S> the amazing mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) , such as high elastic modulus , exceptional directional stiffness , and low density , make them idea candidates for the applications of nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) devises  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have demonstrated the possibilities of using cnt as actuator  @xcite , nanotweezers  @xcite , and nanorelay  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> detailed understanding of mechanical behavior , especially structurally - specific mechanical properties of cnt - based nems devises is therefore crucial for their potential applications in nems .    unlike isotropic elastic thin shell , due to special geometries of swnts , e.g. chiralities </S>",
    "<S> , there is coupling between axial strain and torsion strain , which is similar to ordinary helical spring  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , recent molecular dynamic simulations found asymmetric behaviors of such coupling in chiral swnts  @xcite and double walled carbon nanotubes ( dwnts )  @xcite , namely , asymmetry of a - sit for tensile and compression strains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , upmanyu _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ s finite element method simulation also obtained asymmetric a - sit response  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> main property of asymmetric a - sit is that a - sit responses for tension or compression are much different at large strain . </S>",
    "<S> torsion angle per unit length increases when strain increases in tension case . </S>",
    "<S> however , with increasing strain under compression , the torsion angle firstly increases , then decreases to zero , and increases again after changing the direction of twist  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a - sit implies the coupling between axial vibration modes and torsional ones for chiral swnts , which may play an important role in applications of cnt - nems oscillators  @xcite . to understand a - sit response , </S>",
    "<S> there are very few studies : gartstein , _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite used a two - dimensional continuum elastic model , predicted linear a - sit effect for chiral swnts with small strain , i.e. , swnt twists in opposite directions for tension and compression and rotation angle varies linearly with strain . </S>",
    "<S> gartstein _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ found a - sit response is chirality dependent , it reaches the maximum when the chiral angle is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> liang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ s molecular simulations  @xcite extended the study of a - sit to large strain region ( before buckling ) , obtained asymmetric a - sit . </S>",
    "<S> by comparing a - sit response with changes of geometry of carbon - carbon bonds , they found asymmetry a - sit is relevant to microscopic lattice structure of swnt . </S>",
    "<S> geng _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite studied both of torsion induced by axial strain and axial strain induced by torsion , and showed nonlinear axial stress - strain relation occurring in the same time . </S>",
    "<S> upmanyu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ </S>",
    "<S> s  @xcite finite element method simulation also obtained a - sit .    </S>",
    "<S> all these efforts are valuable in understanding a - sit . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , gartstein _ et al _ s theory was restrict to linear a - sit response , while the molecular dynamic or finite element method simulations for a series of swnts with some special chiral index were time - consuming , a lot of computer resource were needed , which limits their further application to study of properties of actual swnts . </S>",
    "<S> also , there is a general question for these simulation work : can the results of the simulations for small systems be extrapolated to swnts at equilibrium state with actual sizes ?    in our knowledge , there lacks a easily handled theoretical frame capturing basic physics of asymmetric a - sit which can obtain this response for actual swnts at equilibrium states with arbitrary radius and chiralities . to fulfill this task </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a quasi - analytical approach based on continuum elastic theory . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the carbon - carbon interactions in swnt are described by rebo - ii potential  @xcite , which is a classic many - body potential for solid carbon and hydrocarbons . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages for rebo - ii potential are it has analytical form of carbon - carbon pair potentials with the bond length and bond angle as variables of energy functions , the parameters of rebo - ii potential were fitted from a large data sets of experiments and _ ab initio _ calculations . </S>",
    "<S> rebo - ii potential can accurately reproduce elastic properties of diamond and graphite , in ref .  , molecular dynamic simulation was also based on rebo - ii potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the carbon - carbon interaction energy near the equilibrium state without deformations can be obtained analytically by taylor expansion with inclusion of the most important cubic term , i.e. , anharmonic term of bond stretching , @xmath3 here @xmath4 denotes the nearest neighboring atom pairs , @xmath5 denotes angle between bonds @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium state is denoted by @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite the vectors @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the unit axial and circumferential vectors at the @xmath14-atom s site on the swnt surface , @xmath33 is the rotating angle from @xmath31 to tangent vector @xmath34 , which is related to the chiral angle @xmath35 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite after deforming , bond length @xmath36 and bond angle between bond vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 are @xmath39 with unit vector @xmath40 based on these relations , the @xmath0d continuum limit of elastic energy per unit area of swnt in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rebo ] , which avoids introducing ill - defined thickness of swnts , can be written as , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are in - plane elastic constants , @xmath44 , they have analytical expressions , see appendix . among them , @xmath45 , harmonic elastic constant for coupling between axial strain and torsional twist is proportional to @xmath46 , which clearly shows a - sit response is curvature and chirality effect , only occurs in chiral swnt . obviously linear a - sit response is distinct at @xmath47 and significant for swnts with small diameters , which are in accord with previous theoretical and simulation works . for tubes with large diameters and small strains , </S>",
    "<S> anharmonic elastic energy can be ignored along with @xmath45 and @xmath48 terms , then the isotropic thin shell model for swnts is recovered , and the calculated in - plane young s modulus and possion s ratio are similar to the results in ref .  .    to study the asymmetric a - sit , we consider a chiral swnt with one fixed end , while the other end atoms are allowed to relax both radially and tangentially during deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the axial displacement is fixed for each simulation step , ensuring that only axial stress occurs , which is the basic assumption in simulations for a - sit in swnts  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the free energy per unit area of swnt under axial stress is , @xmath49    assumption of equilibrium state leads to the following nonlinear equations @xmath50 they give the relation between torsion angle per nm ( in unit of degree ) @xmath51 and axial strain @xmath52 , which is an asymmetric response . </S>",
    "<S> there are two critical compressing strains @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . for axial compression , at @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> torsion angle reaches its extreme , then swnt begins to untwist , after totally untwisting at critical strain @xmath56 , the tube twists again to the opposite direction , i.e. , to the direction as the same as that for tension case .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting result is nonlinear axial stress - strain relation , the axial secant young s modulus @xmath57 of swnt is a strict monotonically decreasing function , @xmath58 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , thus swnts show strain softening under tension , while strain hardening under compression . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon was also found in recent molecular dynamic simulations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we find asymmetric a - sit and nonlinear axial stress - strain of swnt are tightly related to each other , the nature of which is anharmonicity of atom - atom interaction for swnts , such as rebo - ii potential in ref .   and present work . </S>",
    "<S> this anharmonicity leads to anharmonic bond stretching energy in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rebo ] and cubic terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ elastic_energy ] , elastic energy . to illustrate it , </S>",
    "<S> we start from a simplified linear elastic energy per unit area of swnt , @xmath59 after substituting nonlinear stress - strain relation @xmath60 to @xmath61 , using equilibrium condition @xmath62 the torsion angle , which is proportional to @xmath63 , is a quadratic function of axial strain . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 curve is a parabola with its symmetric axial located at @xmath65 thus , present analysis captures main features of asymmetry a - sit .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ elastic_energy ] without cubic terms gives the linear a - sit response s coefficient @xmath66 with leading term @xmath67 characterizing linear a - sit response , which is in good agreement with gartstein _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ s theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> therefore present analysis captures the main characters of a - sit response .    in our continuum elastic theory </S>",
    "<S> , we only get symmetric a - sit without anharmonic terms , however ref </S>",
    "<S> .   gave asymmetric a - sit by finite element simulation based on harmonic elasticity , although much small ( @xmath68 @xmath69 of those of molecular simulations ) . </S>",
    "<S> it may be due to the elastic energy we used is the continuum limit of lattice energy , which may lose some subtle microscopic information . </S>",
    "<S> our continuum elastic theory has some advantages , compared to previous simulations , for it is suitable to study swnts with actural sizes , and all the elastic constants in the theory are obtained analytically . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , our method can be extended to calculate other anharmonic properties of swnts with arbitrary radius and chiralities .    in summary , we emphasize the anharmonicity of inter - atoms interactions and curvature - chirality induced anisotropic elasticity are both important in a - sit response , and explain the asymmetry a - sit and nonlinear stress - strain relation all together . </S>",
    "<S> we find the unusual asymmetric a - sit effects is the consequence of the curvature - chirality effect and anharmonic elasticity . </S>",
    "<S> we give the analytical expressions of anharmonic elastic energy , as well as curvature - chirality induced anisotropic elasticity based on rebo - ii . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results are in reasonable agreement with recent molecular dynamic simulations . </S>",
