    "characterizing the thermodynamic properties of matter composed of strongly interacting particles has been the premier objective of heavy ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern  @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics has played a very important role in analyzing the data from these collisions  @xcite and providing a viable description of the collective dynamics of the produced matter .",
    "recently , the observation of a large elliptic flow(@xmath3 ) of hadrons in 200 agev au - au collisions at rhic could be explained quantitatively using a small but finite value of shear viscosity over entropy density ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "however , a consistent formulation of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is far from trivial .",
    "the first order theories are seen to lead to instabilities due to acausal propagation of perturbations .",
    "the second - order theory due to israel and stewart  @xcite currently appears to be the most consistent macroscopic formulation to study collective phenomena in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "though the hydrodynamic equations may be derived from entropy considerations using the second law of thermodynamics , a microscopic approach is necessary in order to determine the parameters e.g. the coefficients of shear and bulk viscosity , thermal conductivity and the relaxation times of the corresponding fluxes .",
    "the boltzmann transport equation has been used extensively as the underlying microscopic theory to estimate the transport coefficients of relativistic imperfect fluids . in this approach",
    "the ( differential ) scattering cross - section in the collision integral is the dynamical input and plays a significant role in determining the magnitude of the transport coefficients .",
    "the case of a pion gas has received some attention and several estimates of the transport coefficients exist in the literature . in all the cases the @xmath0 cross - section corresponds to the one in vacuum .",
    "either the chiral lagrangian has been used  @xcite to derive the scattering amplitude or it has been parametrized from phase shift data  @xcite .",
    "in general , medium effects affect the collision integral in two competing ways",
    ". the larger phase space occupancy due to the bose factors @xmath5 for the final state pions results in an increase of the collision rate .",
    "this is compensated to some extent by a smaller effective cross - section on account of many - body effects ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the effect of the medium on the viscosities  @xcite and thermal conductivity  @xcite was studied using the chapman - enskog approach and significant modification in the temperature dependence of the coefficients was observed .",
    "in addition to the coefficients of viscosity and thermal conductivity the corresponding relaxation times @xmath6 also go as input in the viscous hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "they indicate the time taken by the fluxes to relax to their steady state values and consequently play an important role in determining the space - time evolution of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "this is more so for systems where @xmath6 is of the same order or larger than the mean collision time @xmath7 of the particles since several collisions may occur during the relaxation of the dissipative flows to their steady state values as in the case of a strongly interacting system like the one created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "moreover , though the magnitude of the shear viscosity is usually much larger than the bulk viscosity , the corresponding relaxation times may be comparable . also , the ratios of the viscous coefficients to their relaxation times are found  @xcite to behave differently with respect to temperature .",
    "there are a few estimates of the relaxation times available in the literature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relaxation times have been evaluated in  @xcite with a parametrized cross section which is independent of temperature .",
    "constant values of transport coefficients have been used in  @xcite and in  @xcite these quantities have been obtained using conformal field theory .    in the present study",
    "we investigate the effect of the medium on the relaxation times of the dissipative flows .",
    "as is well known , the chapman - enskog approach leads to a linear relationship between the thermodynamic forces and the corresponding irreversible flows . because of the parabolic nature of the equations of motion this results in infinite speeds of these flows . in order to have access to the relaxation times we use the more general 14-moment method due to grad  @xcite . with the inclusion of the viscous pressure tensor and the heat flow to the original ( five ) hydrodynamic variables",
    "the relations between fluxes and forces contain time derivatives of the fluxes and cross - couplings between them .",
    "the hyperbolic nature of the equations of motion in this case result in finite relaxation times of the dissipative flows .",
    "our aim in this work is to estimate the change in the temperature dependence of the relaxation times for the shear and bulk viscous flows and the heat flow for a hot pion gas on account of the in - medium cross - section .",
    "we thus evaluate the @xmath0 scattering amplitude with an effective lagrangian in a thermal field theoretic framework and use it in the uehling - uhlenbeck collision integral which contains the bose enhancement factors for the final state pions .",
    "in addition to a significant medium dependence we find the relaxation times for the viscous and heat flows for a chemically frozen pion gas to be of comparable magnitude .    the formalism to obtain the relaxation times of the dissipative fluxes using the 14-moment method is described in the next section .",
    "this is followed by a discussion on the medium dependent @xmath0 cross - section in sec.iii .",

    "the zeroth order distribution function @xmath18 contains a few arbitrary parameters which are identified with the temperature , chemical potential and hydrodynamic 4-velocity of the system by asserting that the number density , energy density and the hydrodynamic velocity are completely determined by the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "we thus write the number and energy densities as n = g_p p^u_f = g_p p^u_f^(0 ) , + en = g_p ( p^u_)^2f = g_p ( p^u_)^2f^(0 ) where @xmath142 is the isospin degeneracy of pions . furthermore , from eckart s definition of the hydrodynamic velocity we get ,    ^n_=_p^p_f^(0)=0 .    from the above three equations",
    "we obtain equations ( [ con1]),([con2 ] ) and ( [ con3 ] ) which on substitution in the expression for @xmath14 results in , & & _ p a(x , ) f^(0)(1+f^(0))=0 , + & & _ p ^2 a(x , ) f^(0)(1+f^(0))=0 , + & & _ p ^b_(x , ) ^f^(0)(1+f^(0))=0 .    expanding the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath64 according to equations ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) , we finally obtain ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "here we elaborate on the coefficients of bulk viscosity , thermal conductivity and shear viscosity which are given by & = & t + & = & - + & = &  .",
    "the numerators have been defined earlier .",
    "the quantities @xmath78 , @xmath84 and @xmath87 are defined in terms of the collision bracket = d_p d_k d_p  d_kf^(0)(p)f^(0)(k ) \\{1+f^(0)(p)}\\{1+f^(0)(k)}(f)(g )  w [ bracket ] with ( f)&=&f(p)+f(k)-f(p)-f(k ) + ( g)&=&g(p)+g(k)-g(p)-g(k )  . in particular , a_22=&&[^2,^2 ] , + b_11=&&_[^,^ ] , + c_00=&&[__,^^ ] .",
