    "when d - branes are wrapped on some nonsupersymmetric cycles in the moduli space of compactified manifolds , e.g. , k3 or calabi - yau manifolds , they are dissociated and form several stable d - branes among which each is wrapped on a supersymmetric cycle  @xcite .",
    "a representative example is a d@xmath5-brane and one of the directions is compactified as a circle of radius @xmath6 . at the critical radius @xmath7",
    ", it decays into a pair of d@xmath8 branes  @xcite situated at diametrically opposite points . in terms of boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) , this phenomenon is described by a marginal deformation interpolating between the original unstable d@xmath5-brane and the d@xmath8 pair  @xcite .    in the context of effective field theory ( eft ) where the instability of d@xmath5-brane is represented by condensation of a tachyon field ,",
    "the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) type effective action  @xcite with the choice of @xmath2 potential  @xcite can reproduce this as an array of static tachyon kink - antikinks with fixed period @xmath9  @xcite . only in this eft ,",
    "the tachyon profile in bcft and the tachyon field configuration in eft has one - to - one correspondence by an explicit point transformation  @xcite so that the identification between them can clearly be made at the classical level  @xcite .",
    "when the gauge field is turned on on the unstable d - brane , the period of the d@xmath8 array starts changing from @xmath9 to a larger value and it eventually goes to infinity when the electric field approaches the critical value  @xcite . for each value of the electric field",
    ", the period is fixed and independent of other integration constants of the equation of motion in eft with @xmath2 potential  @xcite .    on the other hand , when the shape of tachyon potential is chosen to be different from @xmath2 , the property of fixed periodicity seems likely to be lost even in pure tachyon case  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we will show that , in the eft with dbi type action , the @xmath2 tachyon potential should uniquely be chosen in order to keep this periodic property .",
    "the codimension - one d - branes which are represented as kinks or antikinks in eft become bps objects only in zero thickness limit  @xcite ( except the case of the composite of d@xmath5-brane and fundamental string ( f1 ) fluid with critical electric field  @xcite ) .",
    "this is also true for codimension two or three objects such as vortex - antivortex pairs or monopole - antimonopole pairs though bcft description may not be explicit  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider another configuration , a generation of a tubular brane on r@xmath10s@xmath11 of which the thin limit is a supertube  @xcite along the equator of s@xmath11 .",
    "the tubular d2-brane can have an arbitrary cross sectional shape  @xcite and it is natural to expect this property to appear also in tachyon tubes from an unstable d3-brane  @xcite .",
    "we will find thick tachyon tube solutions of arbitrary cross section from an unstable d3-brane on the background manifold r@xmath12 , and discuss bps supertube limit by taking the thickness to be zero .",
    "the case of @xmath13 is of our particular interest . in this case",
    "the base spacetime is embedded in r@xmath14s@xmath11 of six - dimensional salam - sezgin model  @xcite .",
    "recently salam - sezgin model has been studied in various contexts  @xcite@xcite . in particular , several investigations have been made in relation with the vacuum structure .",
    "a consistent s@xmath11 reduction of the salam - sezgin model was performed and its four - dimensional spectrum was analyzed  @xcite .",
    "a new family of supersymmetric vacua in the six - dimensional chiral gauged @xmath15 supergravity was discovered , of which the generic form is ads@xmath16s@xmath17 , and in this scheme r@xmath14s@xmath11 can be viewed as a fine - tuning  @xcite .",
    "uniqueness of the salam - sezgin vacuum among all nonsingular backgrounds with four - dimensional poincar , de sitter , or anti de sitter invariance was proved  @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the eft , and it is unclear whether or not the obtained tube solution can be a consistent bcft solution in the background of string theory . since higher - dimensional origin of salam - sezgin model has also been obtained  @xcite , this important issue should be addressed in a consistent manner .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we prove uniqueness of the tachyon potential for fixed periodicity of the array of tachyon soliton - antisoliton pairs . in section 3 ,",
    "we obtain exact tachyon tube solutions on @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a two - dimensional manifold , and discuss their bps limit . in section 4 , we consider the case @xmath18 in more detail .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with brief discussion .",
    "the effective tachyon action for an unstable d@xmath5-brane system  @xcite is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the metric given from the closed string sector , @xmath21 is tachyon field , and @xmath22 field strength tensor of a gauge field @xmath23 on the d@xmath5-brane , of which the constant piece can also be interpreted as ns - ns two form field .",
    "we set @xmath24 and then @xmath25 is tension of the d@xmath5-brane .    since",
    "tachyon potential measures variable tension of the unstable d - brane , it should be a runaway potential connecting @xmath26 various forms of it have been proposed , e.g. , @xmath27 from boundary string field theory  @xcite or @xmath28 for large @xmath29 in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ the form  @xcite @xmath30 which connects the small and the large @xmath29 behaviors smoothly . here ,",
    "@xmath6 is @xmath31 for the non - bps d - brane in the superstring and 2 for the bosonic string .",
    "this form of the potential has been derived in open string theory by taking into account the fluctuations around @xmath32s - brane configuration with the higher derivatives neglected , i.e. , @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "most of the physics of tachyon condensation is irrelevant to the detailed form of the potential once it satisfies the runaway property and the boundary values ( [ vbd ] ) .",
    "for example , both the basic runaway behavior of rolling tachyon solutions  @xcite and the bps nature of tachyon kinks with zero thickness  @xcite are attained irrespective of the specific shape of the potential which just reflects a detailed decaying dynamics of the unstable d - brane .    on the other hand , there are also some nice features of the form ( [ v3 ] ) in addition to the fact that it is derived from open string theory in a specific regime . under the 1/cosh tachyon potential ( [ v3 ] ) ,",
    "exact solutions are obtained for rolling tachyon  @xcite and tachyon kink solutions on unstable d@xmath5 with a coupling of abelian gauge field for arbitrary @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "another useful property may be the observation that some of the obtained classical solutions @xmath21 in the eft ( [ fa ] ) , e.g. , rolling tachyons  @xcite and tachyon kinks  @xcite , can be directly translated to bcft tachyon profiles @xmath34 in open string theory described by the following relation obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath35    in this section , we would like to discuss another important feature of the 1/cosh potential ( [ v3 ] ) , which is not shared by any other form . among the tachyon soliton solutions in the effective theory , various tachyon array solutions of codimension one",
    "have been found , namely , those formed by pure tachyon kink - antikink  @xcite , tachyon kink - antikink coupled to the electromagnetic field  @xcite , and tachyon tube - antitube  @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of all these solutions is that , with the 1/cosh potential in the eft , the periodicity of the array is independent of any integration constant of the equation of motion , much like the case of simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "here we will show that the converse is also true by adopting the similar line of argument to the case of simple harmonic oscillator : imposing the condition that the periodicity of the tachyon array solutions should be independent of the integration constant of the equation of motion uniquely determines the tachyon potential as eq .",
    "( [ v3 ] ) .",
    "this property is necessary if one wishes to identify the array solution as a configuration on a circle or a sphere of a fixed radius  @xcite .    to begin with , we recall that the relevant equation for all the array solutions with @xmath36 and @xmath22 is summarized by a single first - order ordinary differential equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "( see ref .",

    "it turns out to be convenient to define the variable @xmath55 .",

    "it is now elementary to perform the integral ( [ pint ] ) in the both sides .",
    "the result is @xmath62 i.e. , @xmath63 where @xmath64 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ uf ] ) with eq .  ( [ eee ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath65 as asserted .",
    "this property can also be seen clearly after a point transformation ( [ oto ] ) to the equation ( [ eee ] ) , which , under the specific tachyon potential ( [ v3 ] ) , results in @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 . since both @xmath39 and @xmath6 are fixed but @xmath40 is a variable , @xmath69 is a positive variable and @xmath70 a constant . therefore , eq .",

    "@xcite , its period @xmath73 is independent of the value of @xmath69 only for the simple harmonic oscillator .",
