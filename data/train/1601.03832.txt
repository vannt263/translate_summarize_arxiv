    "the shapes of supernova remnants ( snrs ) are generally far from perfect spherical geometry .",
    "various physical factors cause asphericity , among these are anisotropy of supernova ejecta , hydrodynamic instabilities or inhomogeneities in an ambient interstellar medium .",
    "even the most rotund remnants such as snr 1572 and 1006 @xcite or snr 0509 - 67.5 @xcite are endowed with small scale structures such as ripple , filaments or knots .",
    "the latter two have corrugations with a radius of curvature less than or equal to one tenth of the snr size @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue for the turbulent origin of the rippling in snr 1006 as well as in the other filamentary snr cygnus loop while @xcite speak for multiphaseness .    even accepting the hypothesis of turbulent or multiphase origin we have to admit at the same time an amazing regularity of pattern imprinting fine rippling that can be seen on the recently published composite optical - x - ray image of snr 0509 - 67.5 from _",
    "hubble _ and _ chandra _ released by @xcite .",
    "one can recognize @xmath6 knots observed in longitude : this regular speckled structure envelops the whole remnant s surface .",
    "this regular pattern suggests that some lengthscales of perturbations are more preferred than others and this is hard to understand in a turbulence scenario that is scaleless by nature .",
    "quite the reverse , it would appear reasonable that there exists a physical mechanism amplifying few intermediate scales .",
    "a plausible explanation would be that we observe the development of some instability on the shock surface of the remnant .",
    "if the idea of instability is correct , the fact that the excited scales are not vanishingly small but comparable to the remnant s size argues for the non - local nature of instability .",
    "this means that different fragments of the filamentary structure are physically coupled , which provides for ordering and regularity of the filamentary structure irrespective of initial and , probably , environmental conditions . in the case in point",
    "the globality of instability can be caused by the remnant s size finiteness .",
    "there are a multitude of different types of shock wave instabilities among which the global instabilities constitute a modest set . regarding the snr shocks instabilities the case that should be mentioned above all else is the ryu - vishniac instability @xcite .",
    "this instability is based on the hydrodynamic mechanism of self - excitation of oscillations within a spherical shock wave . however , its scope is limited by gases in almost isothermal state , the increments are sufficiently small , and saturation occurs at weakly non - linear level ( the density enhancements have a factor of @xmath7 ) @xcite .    the spherical shock in the ryu - vishniac representation can be considered a coherent oscillator generating self - sustained oscillations . the spherical shock again is a spherical resonant cavity that can be excited by external disturbances .",
    "indeed , the environment for the interstellar shock is not in the least a perfect uniform background but usually a strongly inhomogeneous , turbulized or phase - separated medium .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the efficiency of possible resonant amplification of disturbances by the spherical shock wave .",
    "the basic idea is that a supernova remnant can filter out some resonant length scales within chaotic and globally scaleless noise in the ambient turbulent or phase - separated interstellar matter .",
    "the possibility of turbulence amplification by the shock waves has been a debatable issue for a long time .",
    "such a possibility has been proved theoretically @xcite , numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the analytical studies focus mainly on the local mechanisms of turbulence amplification .",
    "however , when the finiteness of the flow becomes significant , non - local resonant effects can appear .    in our study",
    "we rely on the linear interaction approximation which is mainly used since the pioneering work by @xcite to analyze the shock - turbulence interaction .",
    "such an approximation seems to be reasonable if the turbulence is significantly subsonic and a low - amplitude one , which of course is the case under consideration .",
    "to a certain extent , our analysis resembles an approach of @xcite ; however , it possesses greater versatility .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the physical model of the shock wave produced by the point explosion , discuss its symmetrical ( scaleless ) properties , define similarity variables both for the unperturbed flow and perturbations , and pose a mathematical problem for the postshock perturbations with particular focus on derivation of the inner boundary conditions .",
    "mathematically , the computational task is reduced to an eigenvalue problem for finding the amplitudes of the postshock perturbations if the amplitudes and frequency of outer perturbations are given . in section 3",
    "we present the results of numerical integration .",
    "we show that both for the vortex modes and for the entropy modes there exist conditions for infinite ( in the linear approximation ) resonant amplification . in section 4",
    "we discuss the domain of applicability of solutions found and present a brief summary .",
    "all supernova remnants mentioned in introduction are young or middle - aged objects with sizes @xmath8-@xmath9 pc for which approximation of adiabatic expansion holds .",
    "thus we base our consideration on an adiabatic shock wave model .",
    "the magnetic field becomes dynamically important if magnetic pressure becomes comparable with dynamic and/or thermodynamic pressure .",
    "simple estimates show that magnetic pressure becomes equal to the density of released supernova energy @xmath10 erg smeared out all over the spherical volume with a radius of 10 pc if the magnetic field attains the value @xmath11 g .",
    "there are many magnetized remnants , and sn1006 with @xmath12 g @xcite among them , for which b - field can not be neglected . on the other hand , @xcite estimate magnetic field value in snr 0509 - 67.5 as 60 @xmath13 g ; therefore magnetic pressure is insignificant there at the adiabatic stage at least . in the present paper",
    "we limit ourselves to an examination of the pure hydrodynamical model neglecting the effects of magnetic pressure .",
    "the shock wave dynamics is described by the system of gasdynamic equations for inviscid perfect gas with an adiabatic index @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 which should be complemented by the outer boundary conditions at the strong shock front which in our case read as @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the density , @xmath22 the velocity , @xmath23 the pressure , and @xmath24 is a shock front velocity .",
    "hereafter we denote by the subscripts `` 0 '' , `` 1 '' the states outside and inside the shock - wave flow , respectively , and @xmath25 denotes the states just behind the shock front .    further we consider both preshock and postshock flows as a superposition of the unperturbed ( mean ) flow and small perturbations @xmath26    the parameters of the mean ambient medium are considered as a motionless , zero - pressure state with spherically symmetric power - law density distribution @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spherical radius , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are certain constants .    we suppose that at the initial moment @xmath31 an instant release of energy @xmath32 takes place in the origin that generates a flow with a strong spherical shock wave .",
    "the mean values inside the shock flow obey the self - similar sedov solution @xcite in which the governing parameter , the similarity index @xmath33 is equal to @xmath34 characterizes the rate of the unperturbed shock front expansion , @xmath35    further we use variables for the mean flow @xmath36 normalized by the postshock values @xmath37 and the self - similar variable as the radial coordinate @xmath38    in dimensionless variables - the system  for the mean flow assumes the form @xmath39",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41    one has two qualitatively different kinds of the unperturbed flow , the shell - like one with a hollow cavity inside ( @xmath42 ) or the solid flow which extends to the center of symmetry ( @xmath43 ) @xcite . in physical applications",
    "the most important are the cases of either uniform background @xmath44 or the power - law decreasing density with the slope @xmath45 . in what follows",
    "we assume @xmath46 .",
    "the latter inequality guarantees mass integrability in the origin .",
    "in describing perturbations we also use the nondimensionalized form : @xmath47 here subscripts @xmath48 and @xmath49 stand for tangential and binormal components of velocity to be explained further and the subscript `` 1 '' for the postshock perturbations is further omitted .    the symmetry of the flow permits looking for a solution for perturbations as an expansion in the vector spherical harmonics .",
    "one can find different definitions of the vector spherical harmonics in the literature @xcite ; we follow that of @xcite .",
    "heuristic arguments for this expansion are as follows .",
    "the sphericity of the unperturbed flow prompts seeking the expansion of scalar functions in a form of factored out terms @xmath50 known as solid spherical harmonics .",
    "spherical functions @xmath51 compose a complete orthogonal basis in the space of functions defined on a sphere @xmath52 .",
    "the vector functions are expanded as follows .",
    "the geometry of the problem defines three preferred directions .",
    "two of them are determined through the gradient of solid spherical harmonics @xmath53 : the first , radial one , is given by the gradient of the radial part , @xmath54 , the second direction is determined by the gradient of the spherical harmonic , @xmath55 . by definition",
    "the latter one is tangential to the concentric sphere of radius @xmath56 and thus orthogonal to @xmath57 . the third direction",
    "is then determined unambiguously as an orthogonal complement .",
    "the right - hand triple of unit vectors @xmath58 thus sets the ` natural ' orthogonal system of coordinates .",
    "this new coordinate system allows splitting the nabla operator in expansions similar to to radial , @xmath59 , and tangential , @xmath60 , parts and to complement it by the binormal counterpart @xmath61 : @xmath62 the natural system optimizes the analysis inasmuch as the binormal component of perturbed velocity degenerates and thus perturbations are reduced to two - dimensional ones .",
    "ultimately , the symmetry and similarity of the flow allow us to look for a solution for perturbations as an expansion in the solid spherical harmonics @xmath63 here @xmath64 has a meaning of the radius vector in a comoving spherical coordinate system , @xmath65 is a frequency in the ` comoving ' logarithmic time scale @xmath66 and the frequency does not depend on @xmath67 since the differential equations for perturbations do not depend on the @xmath67-wavenumber .",
    "the radial dependencies of perturbations @xmath68 are found by solving the system of linearized hydrodynamic equations which can be obtained from the system - with the help of - , , .",
    "orthogonality of harmonics allows uncoupling and factorization of equations @xcite : @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 hereinafter the subscripts @xmath74 and @xmath67 are omitted .",
    "the typo in the bracketed expression at the first term in from @xcite is corrected as well .",
    "it is worth noting once more that the system - is @xmath67-wavenumber degenerated and that the variable @xmath75 uncouples ( eq .  ) .",
    "the system - describes perturbations both inside and outside the shock wave .",
    "first consider the external to the shock perturbations coded by the subscript `` 0 '' .",
    "the radial function @xmath76 in solid harmonics is usually chosen as an expansion in eigenfunctions of some operator relevant to the problem @xcite .",
    "for example , for the laplace equation @xmath77 the radial parts are just power functions ; the expression @xmath78 yields a general solution of the laplace equation in a ball .",
    "this power - law expansion of the radial function is nothing but the taylor series . considering the perturbations as a regular scalar or vector field bounded within the finite domain we use the power - law solid spherical harmonics @xmath79 as a basis for the external perturbations expansion .",
    "for simplicity , we further limit ourselves to the principal mode @xmath80 , the subscript @xmath81 will , therefore , be omitted .",
    "it follows therefrom that the absolute external perturbations @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 under consideration are spatially uniform .    assuming the turbulent motion in the ambient medium to be a slow and subsonic one , and the outside pressure perturbations negligible compared with the pressure behind the strong shock wave",
    ", we can neglect the external acoustic perturbations ( @xmath85 ) and consider just two different modes , either ( i ) the vortical mode ( @xmath86 ) , or ( ii ) entropy perturbations ( @xmath87 ) . in any case",
    ", the acoustic perturbations ( @xmath88 ) can not be considered self - consistently as far as they violate the similarity condition .    as we know",
    ", the vortex and entropy modes are frozen in the environment which we regard as motionless , thus they have zero frequency in the rigid reference frame . at the same time , relative perturbations defined in the comoving frame and normalized according to should , of course , be time - dependent .",
    "stationary preshock perturbations must obey the linearized continuity equation @xmath89 taking into account expansion in spherical harmonics , with the aid of we get from the relation between the radial and tangential velocity components @xmath90 this is a unique constraint for the outside perturbations : the other linearized hydrodynamics equations for the momentum and energy conservation are satisfied automatically .",
    "the binormal component of velocity does not enter the equation and can be nullified so long as it does not couple with other terms due to neither boundary conditions on the shock front nor hydrodynamic equations .    in total , one of three perturbations @xmath91 , @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath93 can be considered free whereas the other two should be dependent ones . for the entropy mode",
    "we assume @xmath94 for the vortical mode we have @xmath95    by virtue of stationarity of absolute perturbation , @xmath96 , and self - similarity , @xmath97 , ( see equations , ) for the relative perturbation we get @xmath98 with regard to proportionality @xmath99 according to and using the definition , we finally find the frequency for the entropy mode @xmath100 for the vortex mode with the aid of relations @xmath101 , @xmath102 we similarly get @xmath103 the frequencies , can equally well be found upon substituting , into - .",
    "the radial dependencies @xmath68 of the solution for the perturbations inside the shock wave are not presumed to be power series expansion ; rather , they are to be found by solving the system - with the inner and outer boundary conditions",

    "@xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 corrugation of the shock front is described here by the small dimensionless parameter @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a small shift of the front from its mean value @xmath111 .",

    "@xcite derived the equation @xmath112 which was criticized by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the condition of null perturbed pressure seems to go beyond the bounds of common sense .",
    "if we uniformly compress an element of fluid , pressure will definitely grow inside the fluid .",
    "@xcite proposed another condition which they formulated in an asymptotic form suggesting a lack of similarity at the origin due to specific initial conditions ( non - point and probably non - instant energy release ) .",

    "first , we note that the unperturbed variables asymptotically behave at the origin @xmath128 as @xcite @xmath129 here @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "this particularly means that the term @xmath133 is asymptotically negligible compared to other terms in equation as well as in equation but the other term with pressure @xmath134 and the pressure gradient itself matter .",
    "the coefficients of the system - , asymptotically behave as power functions at the origin .",
    "therefor , e we look for solutions for perturbations as power laws in @xmath56 . from equation",
    "we find @xmath135 , @xmath136 ; from equation we get also @xmath137 .",

    "the asymptotics for the momentum fluxes is @xmath148 and all terms in - are of the same order again .",
    "and finally for the energy flux the asymptotics is @xmath149 which is determined by the dominating term @xmath150 .",
    "the majorizing term among these is that whose power exponent is the minimum one . if @xmath151 , the mass flux dominates , if @xmath152 the energy flux does . in the latter case",
    "the majorizing term is @xmath150 , in the former case vanishing of @xmath150 implies vanishing of all other perturbation terms .",
    "thus , the inner boundary no - source condition yields an equation @xmath153      inner boundary condition for the shell - like flow can be derived as the condition for a contact interface in the point @xmath154 separating gas and vacuum .",
    "two conditions must be fulfilled simultaneously for the contact discontinuity : ( i ) there is no flux through the shifted boundary and ( ii ) the pressure at the shifted boundary is identically zero .",

    "thus , equations - in reality are a singular system",
    ".    the correct condition can be derived by exceeding the limits of linear approximation and by using the property ( ii ) of the contact discontinuity . since from now on , we temporally use non - linear dependencies , let us temporally consider all perturbations as real variables . for the perturbed pressure @xmath163 at the perturbed inner boundary in the first order we have",

    "given the amplitudes and frequency of the external perturbations , the structure of the perturbed flow inside the shock wave is determined by solving in the interval @xmath173 , @xmath198 the system of linear odes - , for unknown variables @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 with the outer - and inner , or boundary conditions .",

    "figure  [ eigenfunctions ] demonstrates the typical behavior of the eigenfunctions in the case of shell - like flow .    to estimate the possible amplification of perturbations by the shock wave we introduce the following coefficients of    density amplification @xmath200 velocity amplification @xmath201 and vorticity amplification @xmath202 accounting for an explicit form for the curl of the vector @xmath203 with zero binormal component in natural coordinates @xmath204 we can write out the vorticity amplification coefficient in full as @xmath205 all these coefficients of amplifications are ratios of amplitudes and time - constant by definition .",
    "first let us consider the vortex mode whose frequency is given by equation  .",

    "the same effect exists of course in the case of any background which involves @xmath207 however , but since we consider the vortex and the entropy modes separately , we do not observe this resonance in other figures .",
    "let us remember that the curl of velocity for any harmonic is expressed as a product of an amplitude depending on @xmath56 and the angular part @xmath208 .",

    "the limit @xmath209 thus provides an evaluation of indeterminate form as zero divide zero because the vorticities themselves @xmath210 and @xmath211 vanish .    from figures  [ vorticity_ampl],[velocity_ampl ]",
    "we see that vorticity intensifies substantially up to 20 times within the wavenumbers range under consideration out of resonance while the velocity fluctuations are damped .",
    "the reason for vorticity amplification is that the rippled shock front generates the shear flow .",
    "while the radial velocity perturbations are strongly suppressed the tangential perturbations are excited .",
    "for instance , for the shortwave perturbation @xmath212 whose eigenfunctions are depicted in figure  [ eigenfunctions ] , the preshock velocity perturbations are radially dominated due to relation ( @xmath213 ) but the amplitudes of the postshock velocity components equalize ( @xmath214 ) . along with that the tangential perturbation derivative @xmath215 undergoes a steep rise from zero before the shock to 3.1 behind the shock ( see right bottom inset in figure  [ eigenfunctions ] ) building up vorticity significantly ( see equation  ) .",
    "the most intriguing effect is the resonance that we find in the case @xmath181 at the resonant wavenumber @xmath216 given by equation .",
    "the insets in figures  [ vorticity_ampl],[velocity_ampl ] show that the resonance width is rather small and equals @xmath217 for vorticity and @xmath218 for velocity amplification . here",
    "the resonance width is defined as a range of wavenumbers @xmath74 in which the frequency differs from the ` mean ' values by the value of @xmath219 . strictly speaking , according to the linear theory of oscillations",
    "the width of resonance in the dissipationless case is negligible so long as the width is usually defined as the interval at which the frequency differs no more than twice from the maximum value .",
    "the density perturbations in the entropy mode are amplified out of resonance only in the case of the accelerating shell blast wave ( @xmath181 ) whereas they are damped by decelerating solid blast wave ( @xmath44 ) ( figure  [ density_ampl ] ) .",
    "resonance prescribed by equation   at @xmath220 has a greater width : @xmath221 .",
    "this resonance describes self - excitation of radial fluctuations of the shock at negligible external density perturbations and takes place for arbitrary @xmath30 because dispersion dependencies always comprise the point @xmath222 .",
    "suppose the energy of explosion undergoes small perturbation @xmath223 .",
    "then the relative displacement of the shock front changes over time as @xmath224 that is , according to equation the spherical perturbation will have zero frequency .",
    "our linear analysis validates an idea that the blast wave can amplify both density and vorticity perturbations in the turbulized interstellar medium through resonant shock - turbulence interaction .",
    "this result is consistent with analytic and numerical studies @xcite predicting vorticity amplification by a distorted shock front . as distinct from the aforementioned works we study the non - local mechanism of amplification when the wave lengths @xmath225 of perturbations are not negligible compared with the shock wave size @xmath226 .",
    "this singles out the resonant nondimensional wavenumbers at macro- ( @xmath227 ) , meso- ( @xmath228 ) and microscopic ( @xmath2 ) scales .",
    "resonant mesoscales are surprisingly very close to the observed scales ( @xmath5 ) of corrugation structures in the remnant snr 0509 - 67.5 .    on the other hand , there are some factors negating the effectiveness of the resonant mechanism .",
    "first , the resonance width is small ( typically @xmath229 ) and the resonance point can be clamped between two nearly integer points @xmath74 . since the observed orbital wavenumbers @xmath74 must be integer values , the amplification for these will not be too large .",
    "the resonance range can grow in size however with dissipation increase .",
    "the linear theory of oscillations predicts that the resonance width of frequencies is proportional to the doubled decay coefficient .",
    "taking into account that in our self - similar problem the frequency is defined as @xmath230 and the decay has to be stipulated by the turbulent viscosity we find that @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the turbulent kinematic viscosity .",
    "the length of the perturbation inside the shock wave can be estimated as @xmath233 while the kinematic viscosity approximately is @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the postshock sound velocity and @xmath236 is the characteristic scale of a turbulent vortex . expressing the resonant width in terms of the wavenumbers for the resonant case considered in our model , @xmath80 and @xmath216",
    ", we get @xmath237 the postshock sound velocity is determined through the relations , : @xmath238 where @xmath239 for @xmath180 and @xmath44 we have @xmath240 , for @xmath182 , @xmath181 the coefficient @xmath241 is something like @xmath242 .",
    "since the propagating shock embraces growing scales we estimate the turbulent vortex scale @xmath236 as proportional to the shock front radius @xmath226 with a fixed constant of proportionality @xmath243 . collecting all estimates",
    "we finally obtain @xmath244 the numerical calculations ( fig .",
    "[ spectrg43om27 ] ) show that the derivative of the dispersion relation @xmath245 amounts to @xmath246 at the resonant point @xmath247 . assuming @xmath248 we find @xmath249 which is close to the width of resonance found numerically ( figs .",
    "[ vorticity_ampl]b,[velocity_ampl]b ) .",
    "the estimates adduced show that the resonance range subject to the existence of dissipation is small but widens and can be not vanishingly small if the resonance occurs at a more gently sloping dispersion curve ( @xmath250 ) and for higher order harmonics @xmath184 and @xmath81 .",
    "secondly , to excite resonant oscillations noticeably the amplitude of resonant harmonics in the spectrum of external perturbations should be non - negligible .",
    "suppose turbulent fluctuations energy distribution over discrete orbital quantum numbers @xmath74 has a power dependence like kolmogorov law @xmath251 , and if we are fortunate it starts from @xmath252 where @xmath252 is close to the resonant number @xmath247 , then the relative square of amplitude of the @xmath253 mode amounts to @xmath254 of the total energy of fluctuations .",
    "the estimate can be reduced significantly if @xmath255 .",
