    "quantum cryptography provides us with a perfectly secure cryptosystem , which is feasible in a practical way as well as in a theoretical way .",
    "in particular , quantum key distribution among quantum cryptographic protocols can be considered as one of the most important applications of quantum entanglement , since secure key distillation in quantum key distribution is closely related with entanglement distillation  @xcite .",
    "it has been known that there are two different types of entanglement .",
    "one is called the _ free _ ( or , _ distillable _ ) entanglement , from which one can distill a pure entanglement useful for quantum communication by local quantum operation and classical communication ( locc ) , and the other is called the _ bound _ ( or , _ nondistillable _ ) entanglement , which is not distillable .",
    "even though one can not distill a pure entanglement useful for quantum communication from the bound entanglement , it has been shown that any bound entangled states can be useful in quantum teleportation  @xcite . recently ,",

    "@xcite have shown that there are some classes of bound entangled states with positive key rate by showing that the lower bound @xmath0 of distillable key rate introduced in  @xcite is more than zero for those states .",
    "however , the question of whether every entangled state has positive distillable key rate , @xmath1 , has still remained open . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of quantum states with nonzero distillable key rate , and construct several sufficient conditions of @xmath1 . exploiting the conditions , we show that the bound entangled states with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) given in  @xcite have nonzero distillable key rate , and finally present a new class of ppt bound entangled states satisfying @xmath1 , although @xmath2 for the ccq states of their privacy squeezed versions presented in  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : private states ] we recall the concepts of private states and distillable key rate in  @xcite . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results .",
    "for a positive integer @xmath3 , a _ private state _ ( or , _ pdit _ ) @xmath4 on @xmath5 with @xmath6 , is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 is an arbitrary state of the subsystem @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is an arbitrary twisting operation @xmath12 with unitary matrices @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath4 can be rewritten as @xmath14 when @xmath15 , @xmath4 is called a _ private bit _ ( or , _ pbit _ ) .",
