    "highly efficient light collection and excitation transfer to the reaction center initiates the energy conversion in photosynthesis .",
    "this process takes place in the so - called light - harvesting antenna network .",
    "particularly , the ring subunit of the peripheral light - harvesting antenna ( lh2 ) @xcite of purple bacteria has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the very symmetric arrangement with short distances between the pigments gave new impulses to the discussion about coherence in the exciton transfer and the exciton delocalization in lh2 .",
    "both could be reduced by dynamic and static disorders .",
    "time - dependent experiments made it possible to study the femtosecond dynamics of the energy transfer and relaxation @xcite .",
    "kumble and hochstrasser @xcite have presented a time - domain analysis of the effects of the static disorder upon the dynamics of optical excitations .",
    "the interpretation of time - dependent experiments on the femtosecond time scale requires a theory which incorporates static and dynamic disorder .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend the investigation by kumble and hochstrasser taking into account the simultaneous influence of static and dynamic disorders after impulse excitation .",
    "in addition we calculate the time - dependent anisotropy of fluorescence not only for the symmetric but also for elliptically distorted rings .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath0 describes the transfer of a single exciton with a transfer integral @xmath1 along the ideal ring ( @xmath2 ) , the independent heat baths for each chromophore ( @xmath3 ) , the site  diagonal and linear interaction between the exciton and the bath ( @xmath4 ) , the static disorder ( @xmath5 ) with gaussian distribution ( standard deviation @xmath6 ) and elliptical distortion of the ideal ring ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath2 of the ideal ring leads to eigenstates @xmath8 and eigenenergies @xmath9 . for a symmetrical coplanar arrangement of site transition moments",
    "@xmath10 dipole - allowed transitions populate only the degenerate @xmath11 levels of the ideal ring .",
    "if the ring is elliptically distorted the eigenenergies of the hamiltonian @xmath12 are no longer degenerate as is the case for the ideal ring . with static disorder of the site energies being present ( @xmath13 ) , the stationary states ,",
    "i.e.  the eigenstates @xmath14 of the hamiltonian @xmath15 , correspond to mixtures of @xmath16 and an excitation will prepare a superposition of the @xmath17 states .",
    "the dipole strength @xmath18 of state @xmath19 of the ring with static disorder and the dipole strength @xmath20 of state @xmath21 the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the expansion coefficients of the eigenstates of the ideal and disordered rings in site representation .",
    "kumble and hochstrasser @xcite concluded , that in the case of pump pulse excitation the dipole strength is simply redistributed among the exciton levels due to disorder .",
    "so the amplitudes of site excitations and the phase relationships in the initial state are necessarily identical to that of an equal superposition of @xmath24 excitons of the ideal ring .",
    "thus , generally , the excitation with a pump pulse of sufficiently wide spectral bandwidth will always prepare the same initial state , irrespective of the actual eigenstates of the real ring .",
    "the nature of this initial state is entirely determined by the selection rules of the ring without static disorder . the initial condition for the density matrix by pulse excitation with the polarization @xmath25",
    "is given by ( eq .",
    "( 1a ) in @xcite ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "kumble and hochstrasser @xcite calculated the usual time - dependent anisotropy of fluorescence @xmath28 where , e.g. , @xmath29 the indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 label the eigenstates of the virtual and disordered ring , respectively .",
    "the brackets @xmath32 denote the ensemble average and the average over the direction of the laser pulses with fixed relative directions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    to include the dynamic disorder which contributes to dephasing of the initial wave packet and promotes thermalization of the dephased populations one has to work within the exciton density matrix formalism @xcite instead of using only the exciton wave functions @xmath35 where @xmath36.\\ ] ]",
    "provided that the exciton dynamics is not very fast , its coupling to the bath weak , and except for the initial time - interval @xmath37 ( @xmath38  =  dephasing time of the bath ) , the adequate equation for a factorized initial state is the redfield equation @xcite : @xmath39+{\\mathcal r}\\rho(t ) , \\label{eqmo}\\ ] ] the redfield relaxation superoperator @xmath40 describes the influence of the thermal bath on the dynamics of the exciton .",
    "pek applied several different ways of obtaining of convolutional and convolutionless dynamical equations for the exciton density matrix in the site basis @xcite .",
    "after markovian approximation they have the following form @xmath39-\\delta\\omega\\rho(t ) .",
    "\\label{eqmo}\\ ] ] we proved @xcite the equivalence of the redfield theory without secular approximation with pek s equations after markovian approximation .",
    "in kumble and hochstrasser s modeling , the anisotropy of fluorescence of the ring lh2 subunit decreases from @xmath41 to @xmath42 and subsequently establishes a final value of @xmath43 .",
    "kumble and hochstrasser concluded that one needs static disorder of strength @xmath44 to reach a time decay below 100 fs .    our results for the time dependence ( @xmath45 ) of the anisotropy of fluorescence eq .",
    "( [ aniso ] ) in the symmetrical ring are shown on fig .",
    "1 with static disorder @xmath46 .",
    "in addition we consider two strengths of dynamic disorder @xmath47 , 0.4 entering the spectral density @xmath48 with cut - off frequency @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "inclusion of dynamic disorder leads to faster decay of the anisotropy of fluorescence during the initial stage .",
    "smaller strength of the static disorder @xmath50 than predicted by kumble and hochstrasser would be necessary to guarantee the decrease of the anisotropy of fluorescence during the first 100 fs .",
    "it was concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite based on measurements by chachisvilis et al .",
    "@xcite that the time decay of the anisotropy of fluorescence during the first dozens of fs is _ temperature independent _ in the case of lh2 subunits . our calculation for the symmetrical ring show that such result can be obtained only for @xmath51 .",
    "but because the time resolution of the experiments in @xcite was not too high this very restrictive statement about the strength of the static disorder can only be made with caution .",
    "we expect that some temperature dependence can be seen using experiments with shorter laser pulses .",
    "recent results obtained by single molecule spectroscopy @xcite can only be interpreted @xcite admitting the presence of a @xmath52 distortion of the lh2 ring .",
    "it has , up to now , not been concluded whether such @xmath52 distortion of the lh2 ring is present also in samples in vivo .",
    "we have made calculations which take into account the possible @xmath52 distortion of the ring using the model c by matsushita et al .",
    "@xcite of elliptical distortion of the ring in which the transfer integral @xmath1 is cosine modulated .",

    "2 with the static disorder @xmath46 and the strength of the dynamic disorder @xmath53 for three values of the elliptical deformation @xmath54 , 0.1 , 0.2 .",
    "it is seen , that the inclusion of an elliptical deformation leads to faster decay of the anisotropy of fluorescence and diminishes the influence of the dynamic disorder .",
    "our calculation for the elliptically distorted ring ( @xmath55 @xcite ) show that the _ temperature independent _ time decay of the anisotropy of fluorescence during the first dozens of fs can be obtained even for @xmath56 .",
