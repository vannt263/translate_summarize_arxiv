    "the discovery of the acceleration of the universe by the measurements of the luminosity - redshift relation for type ia supervonae @xcite , combined with the observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , confirmed that about 70% of the density of the universe is made up of an unknown form of energy .",
    "this component , usually referred to as  dark energy \" , is unclumped and smoothly distributed , with an exotic property that it has negative pressure to cause the expansion of the universe to accelerate .",
    "the simplest candidate of dark energy is a non - vanishing , positive cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "we have to , however , explain why it is non - zero but vanishingly small ( @xmath0 ) : possibly we can resort to some yet unknown fundamental symmetry which makes the cosmological constant vanishingly small but non - zero , or we might invoke an anthropic consideration that the observed small value of the cosmological constant allows life and that is why we observe it @xcite ) different vacua , and some of them may be suitable for some kind of intelligent observers like us . ] .    an alternative form of dark energy is a slowly rolling scalar field , called quintessence , which has not yet relaxed at its ground state @xcite . for recent years , there have been considerable developments in the dynamics of the quintessence field .",
    "for example , in the context of so - called tracker solutions @xcite , the simplest case arises for a potential of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is positive and @xmath3 is an adjustable constant . by choosing @xmath3 suitably ,",
    "it is possible to make a transition from an early matter - dominated universe to a later quintessence - dominated universe , free from fine tuning of the initial conditions .",
    "another interesting possibility , @xmath4-essence , is to introduce a non - canonical kinetic term for the scalar field @xcite , which makes the evolution of the scalar field dependent on the background equation of state , explaining why dark energy is dominating now .",
    "anyway , apart from the details , the situation that a scalar field is slowly rolling down its potential is reminiscent of the primordial inflation @xcite , where a scalar field ( the inflaton ) provides the vacuum - like energy density ( @xmath5 ) necessary for a phase of the accelerated expansion by slowly rolling down its flat potential .",
    "hence one may naturally raise a question of how we can couple the early accelerated expansion , the primordial inflation , and the current one together @xcite : is it possible to cause the acceleration we observe recently by the primordial inflation ?",
    "in this paper , we are going to discuss this possibility using a simple model based on the hybrid inflation @xcite , which arises naturally in many string - inspired inflation models , in particular in potentials for moduli fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in section  [ model ] , we present a simple model of dark energy and analyze its dynamics in detail , presenting several conditions which should be satisfied for our model to work properly . unlike the conventional lore that the true minimum of the quintessence potential is presumed to vanish , we find that positive , zero , or negative vacuum energy is possible as we choose a different set of parameters . in section  [ discussions ] , we discuss the variation of the equation of state @xmath6 which might be detected in future observations such as hetdex @xcite . also we briefly address the possibility of realizing our model in supersymmetric theories and obstacles to overcome .",
    "we briefly summarize this paper in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss a simple model of dark energy based on the hybrid model of inflation @xcite . perhaps the simplest way to combine",
    "the onset of present acceleration of the universe with the primordial inflation is to directly couple the inflaton with the quintessence field . in this case , however , first we should ensure that inflation lasts for a long enough time ( at least 60 @xmath7-foldings ) without being disturbed by the interaction with the quintessence field .",
    "moreover , the quintessence potential must remain extremely flat after the inflaton reaches its minimum and decays to reheat the universe .",
    "rather , it is more plausible to couple the quintessence field with some different field which plays no role during the inflaton rolls down its potential and only works to finish inflation : this is what the waterfall field in hybrid inflation model does .",
    "hence we can write the effective potential as @xmath8 where we take @xmath9 as the inflaton field , @xmath10 as the waterfall field , and @xmath11 as the quintessence field . as can be seen from the coupled terms above",
    ", we will experience two phase transitions , which distinguish different stages of the evolution of the universe . in the following subsections",
    ", we will discuss each stage in detail .",
    "the effective masses squared of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "hence , for @xmath14 , the only minimum of the effective potential , eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , is at @xmath15 .",
    "also , with @xmath15 , for @xmath16 , the only minimum of the effective potential is at @xmath17 .",
    "thus , at the early stage of the evolution of the universe , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are trapped at 0 while @xmath9 remains much larger than @xmath18 for a long time .",
    "this stage lasts until @xmath19 , and at that moment we assume that the vacuum energy density @xmath20 is much larger than the potential energy density of the inflaton field @xmath21 , so that the hubble parameter is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "we can additionally assume that the vacuum energy @xmath24 is dominated by @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 so that the subsequent evolutions of the universe after inflation , e.g. , reheating , becomes identical to the usual hybrid model .",
    "this immediately gives @xmath27 now , combining eqs .",
    "( [ h1stlast ] ) and ( [ psidomination ] ) , the slow - roll condition for @xmath28 gives @xmath29 note that this gives another bound on @xmath28 as @xmath30 , and the tightest bound on @xmath28 depends on the comparison between the prefactors of this expression and eq .",
    "( [ mbound1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .      as discussed above ,",
    "when @xmath9 becomes smaller than @xmath18 , a phase transition with the symmetry breaking for @xmath10 occurs . to finish inflation as soon as @xmath9 reaches the critical value @xmath18 , i.e. , for the so - called  waterfall \"",
    ", we first require that the absolute value of the effective mass squared of @xmath10 be much larger than @xmath33 . during inflation , using the slow - roll equation of motion @xmath34 and eqs .",
    "( [ h1stlast ] ) and ( [ psidomination ] ) , we can find that when the inflaton @xmath9 reaches @xmath18 , it decreases by @xmath35 during the time interval @xmath36 . at that time",
    ", the absolute value of the effective mass squared of @xmath10 is given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{psimass }    is much greater than @xmath33 for @xmath38 also , we demand that the time scale for @xmath9 to roll down from @xmath18 to 0 be much shorter than @xmath36 : let us denote @xmath39 as the time @xmath9 takes as it moves from @xmath18 to 0 . then , from @xmath40 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ psimass ] ) and the slow - roll equation of @xmath9 , we have @xmath41 which gives another condition @xmath42 note that the parameters with respect to @xmath9-@xmath10 transition are further constrained from the observed cobe amplitude of density perturbations : we obtain @xcite @xmath43 which looks similar to eqs .",
    "( [ waterfall1 ] ) and ( [ waterfall2 ] ) .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ waterfall1 ] ) , ( [ waterfall2 ] ) and ( [ pertconst ] ) , we can extract the valid range of the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath44 , @xmath31 and @xmath45 : e.g. if we take @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , all the conditions are satisfied .",
    "after this phase transition , the waterfall field @xmath10 oscillates at the minimum and decays so that the universe is reheated of @xmath11 to @xmath10 , and in turn to the thermal bath , the oscillation of @xmath10 may affect the dynamics of @xmath11 .",
    "however , we note that because of the negative sign of their interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , the pattern of instability is quite different from the usual parametric resonance @xcite even though the interaction is strong enough : we will study this issue in more detail separately . ] .    with these conditions",
    ", as soon as @xmath9 reaches @xmath18 , inflation ends within a hubble time , @xmath36 .",
    "also note that when such a rapid phase transition occurs within observationally interesting range , still we can calculate the power spectrum and the spectral index for the density perturbations @xcite by generalizing the standard perturbative method @xcite : generally , the power spectrum shows a scale dependent oscillations after the phase transition @xcite .      while @xmath10 is rolling down to @xmath49 , the effective mass squared of @xmath11 might become negative then another phase transition occurs . for this to happen",
    ", we want @xmath50 , unless no instability for @xmath11 would develop .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition is settled at @xmath51 . when @xmath10 moves along @xmath52 direction , this is equivalent to the condition @xmath53",
    "this means , combined with eq .",
    "( [ psisigma ] ) , @xmath44 is ( much ) bigger than @xmath54 .",
    "we are grateful to andrei linde for pointing out this . ]",
    "@xmath55 note that we can obtain the same condition by requiring that the minimum along @xmath11 direction , @xmath56 given by @xmath57 be real , i.e. , @xmath58 once the above condition is satisfied and @xmath11 rolls down the effective potential , after all the fields are settled at @xmath59 where the potential becomes @xmath60      when @xmath61 , eq .",
    "( [ globalmin ] ) is greater than zero and it corresponds to a non - zero , positive vacuum energy .",
    "hence no matter @xmath11 evolves quickly or not , we are provided with the source of the current acceleration of the universe in this case , and this acceleration will last forever : the universe will eventually behave as a de sitter space .",
    "note that the possible maximum value of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , could be at most as large as the current critical density , @xmath64 .",
    "however , an extreme fine tuning is required to match this value : if we restrict our interest to this case only , our model is no better than the conventional @xmath65cdm because the latter is simpler and hence preferable .",
    "anyway here we do not try to improve this situation .",
    "a study of alleviating this fine tuning problem is very important and interesting , but is outside the scope of the present paper .      for the case",
    "@xmath66 eq .  ( [ globalmin ] ) is exactly zero and no vacuum energy exists .",
    "this case corresponds to the usual quintessential inflation @xcite , where the cosmological constant @xmath65 is assumed to be zero due to some unknown symmetry , and the observed dark energy is supplied by e.g. another scalar field , here @xmath11 . to be able to explain the acceleration of the universe , we require that still @xmath11 be rolling down so that the potential is non - zero .",
    "that is , @xmath11 should roll extremely slowly . note that although @xmath11 begins to evolve only after @xmath10 reaches @xmath67 , for the most time during @xmath11 rolls down the effective potential to @xmath56 , @xmath10 has already settled at @xmath51 within a time @xmath68 as soon as @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we just set @xmath70 throughout the evolution of @xmath11 .    under this circumstance ,",
    "when @xmath11 begins to roll , @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 for @xmath11 to slowly evolve , we require that @xmath73 , the absolute value of the effective mass squared of @xmath11 , be much smaller than @xmath33 , from which we obtain a condition @xmath74 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ v0=0condition ] ) .",
    "indeed , the same bound could be found when we also require that @xmath11 roll very slowly so that for @xmath11 to move by an infinitesimal displacement @xmath75 , it takes much longer time than @xmath36 : the effective potential is given by @xmath76 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ v0=0condition ] ) . hence , combining with the slow - roll equation @xmath77 we find @xmath78 i.e. @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "requiring @xmath81 gives @xmath82 which is the same as eq .",
    "( [ v0=0con1 ] ) .",
    "recent observations find that the vacuum energy , or cosmological constant , is very small and positive , with its value being of order @xmath83 .",
    "the case of negative cosmological constant is not observationally justified , which seems to support the claim that the true minimum of the quintessence potential is zero .",
    "the vacuum state with negative energy is , nevertheless , an interesting theoretical possibility , especially in string theories where anti de sitter solutions are popular .",
    "hence a negative potential may play an important role in cosmology motivated from string theory or m theory , such as cyclic universe model @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath84 when @xmath85 has a real solution and that this solution is smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath86 , the effective mass squared of @xmath11 is given by @xmath87 imposing the slow - roll condition , this gives @xmath88 the same as eqs .",
    "( [ v0=0con1 ] ) and ( [ v0=0con2 ] ) .",
    "since the dark energy observed now is positive definite , @xmath11 should be still evolving and not have crossed @xmath89 : thus we again require that @xmath11 roll down very slowly , from which we obtain the same conditions as the previous section , eqs .",
    "( [ v0=0con1 ] ) and ( [ v0=0con2 ] ) .",
    "however , unlike the cases before , the true vacuum energy is negative and after a ( tremendously ) long time the universe will collapse eventually @xcite , no matter how small the magnitude is .",
    "generally , for evolving dark energy models the equation of state @xmath6 is not a constant but a slowly evolving function . to provide an acceleration of the universe it is constrained to be smaller than @xmath90 , usually taken to be @xmath91 .",
    "recent combined observations of wmap and sdss constrains @xmath6 to be @xmath92 , with uncertainties at the 20% level @xcite . for the first case discussed in the previous section where @xmath61 ,",
    "this is easily satisfied : @xmath6 is very slowly varying as @xmath11 rolls down its potential , finally becoming exactly @xmath92 at the absolute minimum @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath93 , @xmath6 will be eventually 0 after @xmath11 settles at @xmath56 . for the third case , however , it is not as trivial as the other cases",
    ". naively , we may take @xmath94 to be non - zero although very small , then we can write @xmath95 where @xmath96 stands for the kinetic energy , @xmath97 . at first look",
    ", it seems that @xmath6 is divergent at @xmath98 and a discontinuity appears and moreover a phantom phase @xmath99 exists after that point .",
    "let us more closely see this .",
    "the simplest way is to solve the relevant equations numerically : we choose @xmath100 to solve for @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in figure",
    "[ fig_w ] , we plot the resulting equation of state @xmath6 where , as is shown , it oscillate . to understand this behavior first let us consider the expansion of the universe with such a negative potential @xcite : the universe keeps expanding until the moment @xmath103 where the scale factor reaches its largest value , and the universe shrinks afterwards . from the friedmann equation describing a flat universe @xmath104 which has no solution with @xmath105 , we can see that to maintain a real value of @xmath71 no matter positive or negative , @xmath106 should remain positive .",
    "hence , when @xmath107 is negative , the kinetic energy must compensate this negative potential energy and consequently these energies oscillate out of phase : for example , at the negative bottom of the potential , the field is moving fastest so that we have maximum kinetic energy here so that @xmath6 becomes very large .",
    "this is the reason why the equation of state @xmath6 is oscillating , we do nt see such an oscillation . ] and sometimes becomes greater than 1 , the `` stiff '' fluid .",
    "we can easily find the relation with respect to the redshift @xmath108 , by making use of the relation @xmath109 : by solving the equations @xmath110 where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath108 , we can obtain @xmath6 in terms of @xmath108 .",
    "a typical relation between @xmath6 and @xmath108 is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig_w ] .",
    "supersymmetry is believed to be the most promising candidate related to the fundamental problems in particle physics , such as the hierarchy problem and the gauge coupling unification .",
    "since we have not yet observed any supersymmetric partner of known particles , supersymmetry is broken . in the primordial universe where the energy scale is much higher than the present one , however",
    ", the rich structure of supersymmetric and supergravity theories should have played an important role .",
    "hence it is natural to try to implement inflationary scenario within supersymmetry .",
    "there has been an encouraging progress on the hybrid inflation scenario in the context of supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "for example , consider a simple superpotential @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are a pair of superfields in non - trivial representations of some gauge group under which @xmath9 is neutral .",
    "then , in a globally supersymmetric theory , the effective potential is given by @xmath114 here , the absolute supersymmetric minimum appears at @xmath115 .",
    "however , for @xmath116 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 obtain positive masses squared and hence are confined at the origin . by simply adding a mass term @xmath117",
    "which softly breaks supersymmetry , we see that the hybrid inflation scenario is possible .",
    "if we take into account radiative corrections instead , the total effective potential including one - loop corrections is @xmath118\\ ] ] when @xmath119 , and we can see that still inflation is possible .",
    "similarly , we can hope to implement our scenario within supersymmetry .",
    "the simplest possibility should be @xmath120-terms since , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , the coupled term of @xmath10 and @xmath11 has a negative sign , so that an instability for @xmath11 could be developed as @xmath10 , initially confined at zero , rolls away from the origin .",
    "this is easily achieved by assuming that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are oppositely charged under some gauge symmetry .",
    "if it is a @xmath121 symmetry , we can write the @xmath120-term contribution as @xmath122 where we assumed that @xmath10 and @xmath11 have charges equal to @xmath92 and @xmath123 respectively , @xmath124 is the gauge coupling , and @xmath125 is a fayet - iliopoulos @xmath120-term",
    ". we may also include another gauge symmetry under which @xmath9 and @xmath10 are charged with the same sign , then @xmath120-term is given by @xmath126 where we have introduced another gauge coupling @xmath127 and fayet - iliopoulos term @xmath128 .",
    "taking only eqs .",
    "( [ dterm1 ] ) and ( [ dterm2 ] ) into account , the coupled terms are given by @xmath129    we can reproduce the same forms for @xmath130 and @xmath131 terms as eq .  ( [ potential ] ) as long as @xmath132 is positive .",
    "this sheds some light on the realization of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .    however , this is far from a realistic possibility .",
    "first of all , we have not considered any @xmath133-term contributions .",
    "we do not want to couple @xmath9 and @xmath11 to guarantee their desired behaviors on the flat enough effective potential , but it seems not easy to achieve this through the contributions from @xmath133-term .",
    "more fundamentally , in globally supersymmetric theories the scalar potential is either positive or zero , which does not include the interesting case of @xmath84 . also , it is thought that below the planck scale particle physics is described by an effective @xmath134 supergravity theory derived from string theory .",
    "hence , a more detailed analysis of our model and associated problems should be addressed in the context of supergravity : for example , the mass of the field should be very small , of order the present hubble parameter @xmath135 , so that it is still rolling toward its true minimum .",
    "however , usually scalar fields acquire masses of order the gravitino mass @xmath136 , much heavier than @xmath137 . one way to evade",
    "this difficulty is to use pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons problem associated with generic scalar field potentials in supergravity . ]",
    "@xcite , e.g. , string / m theory axion , as @xmath11 field @xcite .",
    "we will leave such an analysis as a challenging future work .",
    "we have investigated a simple dark energy model based on hybrid inflation . the quintessence field @xmath11 is coupled to the waterfall field @xmath10 so that as @xmath10 rolls towards @xmath138 , @xmath11 begins to move along the effective potential provided that eq .",
    "( [ psisigma ] ) is satisfied .",
    "a number of bounds on the parameters of the model are found , such as eqs .",
    "( [ psidomination ] ) , ( [ mbound1 ] ) , ( [ mpsibound1 ] ) , ( [ waterfall1 ] ) and ( [ waterfall2 ] ) .",
    "an interesting point is that the true minimum of the effective potential , eq .",
    "( [ globalmin ] ) , depends on our choice of the parameters , allowing the vacuum state with positive , negative and zero energy . when it is negative",
    ", the universe will eventually collapse , showing an oscillation in the equation of state @xmath6 for dark energy which we can hope to detect in future observations .",
    "this model could be realized in supersymmetric theories via @xmath120-term contributions , but including @xmath133-term parts and supergravity effects makes this model not easy to be achieved .",

    "<S> the situation that a scalar field provides the source of the accelerated expansion of the universe while rolling down its potential is common in both the simple models of the primordial inflation and the quintessence - based dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this point , we address the possibility of causing the current acceleration via the primordial inflation using a simple model based on hybrid inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we trigger the onset of the motion of the quintessence field via the waterfall field , and find that the fate of the universe depends on the true vacuum energy determined by choosing the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the variation of the equation of state and the possible implementation of our scenario in supersymmetric theories .    </S>",
