    ", the response of the system to collisions between its rigid moving parts is specified by assigning appropriate boundary conditions that tell how a trajectory should be continued once it reaches the boundary . for example , in the theory of billiard dynamical systems , a topic that may be defined very broadly as the study of hamiltonian ( more typically , geodesic flow ) systems on riemannian manifolds with boundary , one typically assumes that trajectories reflect off the boundary specularly  the simplest form of impact response compatible with the basic laws of mechanics such as energy conservation and time reversibility .",
    "billiard systems with more general boundary conditions have to our knowledge been investigated very rarely .",
    "one pertinent example is @xcite , which is restricted to @xmath6-dimensional billiards .",
    "( there is , of course , an extensive literature in engineering and applied physics about less idealized systems governed by impact interactions , but this literature is not concerned with the differential geometric issues that are the main focus here . )",
    "our first goal is to classify boundary conditions for systems defined by two unconstrained rigid bodies in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , under standard physical assumptions of energy conservation , linear and angular momentum conservation , time reversibility , linearity of response , and another condition to be defined shortly that extends momentum conservation and is typically made implicitly in textbooks .",
    "collisions satisfying all of these properties will be called _",
    "strict_. they are formally represented by linear maps @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the configuration manifold equipped with the kinetic energy riemannian metric , @xmath8 is a boundary configuration , and the tangent space @xmath9 is the space of ( pre- and post- ) collision states .",
    "a boundary condition for the system then consists of the ( differentiable , measurable , random , etc . )",

    "the collision map is not uniquely determined by the conditions of strict collision .",
    "it is well - known that the nature of the contact between the colliding rigid bodies also needs to be specified .",
    "the standard case in which @xmath10 is specular reflection corresponds to bodies having physically smooth surfaces .    towards this classification",
    "we identify a family of subbundles of @xmath13 arising naturally under the assumed physical laws and discuss some relationships among them .",
    "we then show examples of trajectories of non - standard ( i.e. , non - specular ) boundary conditions and make a few observations about their dynamics based on numerical simulation .",
    "although we leave for future work a more systematic analysis of rough billiard dynamics , we give here sufficient conditions for the non - standard billiard system to leave invariant the natural volume measure on a constant energy manifold ( derived from the canonical symplectic form ) .",
    "the invariance of this _ billiard measure _ makes it possible to bring the tools of ergodic theory ( see @xcite ) to the study of non - standard billiard systems , although we do not pursue this direction here .",
    "for the most part we consider the unconstrained motion of two rigid bodies , represented by the sets @xmath14 .",
    "we call these sets the _ bodies in reference configuration_. let @xmath15 denote the euclidean group of orientation preserving isometries of @xmath1 equipped with the standard inner product .",
