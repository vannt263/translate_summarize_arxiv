    "diffractive processes were intensively studied at hera in @xmath5 and @xmath6 collisions for more than a decade .",
    "on theoretical side , somewhat enigmatically , these are processes with exchange of pomeron or processes with the qcd amplitude without net color exchange . in such processes",
    "pomeron must be treated rather technically , depending on the formulation of the approach",
    ". experimentally such processes are defined by special requirement(s ) on the final state .",
    "the most popular is a requirement of rapidity gap starting from the final proton(s ) on one ( single - diffrative process ) or both ( central - diffractive process ) sides .",
    "the size of the gap is essentially experimental observable but it is not easy to calculate theoretically .",
    "several processes with different final states were studied at hera , such as dijet , charm production , etc .",
    "the h1 collaboration has found a set of so - called diffractive parton distributions in the proton inspired by the ingelman - schlein model @xcite . in this fit",
    "both pomeron and reggeon contributions were included .",
    "we wish to emphasize that there is no common consensus as far as a model of diffractive production is considered .",
    "however , these open problems go beyond the scope of the present paper and will be not discussed here .",
    "one can gain a better understanding of the mechanism of the diffractive production by going from photon - proton to proton - proton or proton - antiproton scattering .",
    "there , however , some new elements related to nonperturbative interaction between protons show up , such as absorption effects .",
    "so far only some selected diffractive processes were discussed in the literature such as diffractive production of dijets @xcite , production of @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite bosons , production of @xmath9 pairs @xcite or production of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the latter was done there only for illustration of the general situation at the parton level . the cross section for diffractive processes",
    "are in general rather small ( e.g. the single - diffractive processes are of the order of a few percent compared to inclusive cross sections ) . in order to measure rapidity gap(s )",
    "the luminosity can not be big to avoid so - called pile - ups @xcite .",
    "all this causes that for some interesting processes , as for instance @xmath7 or @xmath11 production , the statistics is rather poor and the cross section is difficult to measure .",
    "since the cross section for inclusive production of charm is very large at the lhc @xcite , one could expect that also single- and central- diffractive charm production could be measured with relatively good precision .",
    "this is therefore a process one could use for testing theoretical models .",
    "the same shall be true for diffractive bottom production .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present predictions including our knowledge about diffractive parton distributions from hera and taking into account absorption effects , specific for proton - proton collisions .",
    "we shall include both pomeron and reggeon contributions .",
    "in addition , we shall include hadronization of @xmath12 or @xmath13 quarks / antiquarks to open charmed and bottom mesons , respectively .",

    "although there was a lot of theoretical activity in calculating diffractive production of different objects ( gauge bosons ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , jets or dijets , higgs boson , pairs of gauge bosons ( @xmath9 ) in proton - proton or proton - antiproton collisions , almost no detailed experimental studies were performed and presented in the literature .",
    "such a study would be interesting and important in order to understand mechanism of diffractive production .",
    "this is partly so as many reactions considered so far have rather very small cross section .",
    "so far there is no common agreement on what is underlying mechanism of diffractive production .",
    "since the underlying dynamics is of nonperturbative nature any detailed studies would be therefore very helpful to shed new light on the problem .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss in more detail single- and central- diffractive production of charm and bottom quark - antiquark pairs as well as open charmed and bottom mesons .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are rather large .    in the present study",
    "we have limited ourselves to the most popular ingelman - schlein model of resolved pomeron and reggeon .",
    "although there is no experimental proof for the model and its underlying dynamics it has advantage it was used to describe many diffractive processes at hera . in the purely hadronic processes considered in the present paper",
    "it must be supplemented by including absorption effects due to nonperturbative interaction of hadrons ( protons ) .",
    "in our approach we use diffractive parton distribution in the proton obtained at hera from the analysis of diffractive structure function of the proton and diffractive production of jets . both pomeron and reggeon contributions",
    "are considered here .",
    "first we have calculated cross sections for @xmath10 and @xmath14 production in single and central production .",
    "several quark - level differential distributions are shown and discussed .",
    "we have compared pomeron and reggeon contributions for the first time .    in order to make predictions which could be compared with future experimental data in the next step",
    "we have included hadronization to charmed ( @xmath2 ) and bottom ( @xmath3 ) mesons using a practical method of hadronization functions known for other processes .",
    "we have shown several inclusive differential distributions for the mesons as well as correlations of @xmath2 and @xmath79 mesons . in these calculations",
    "we have included detector acceptance of the atlas , cms and lhcb collaboration experiments .",
    "the production of charmed mesons is extremely interesting because of the cross section of the order of a few microbarns for atlas and cms and of the order of tens of microbarns for the lhcb acceptance .",
    "we have shown that the pomeron contribution is much larger than the subleading reggeon contribution .",
    "especially the lhcb main detector supplemented with velo ( vertex locator ) micro - strip silicon detectors installed already in run i and so - called herschel ( high rapidity shower counters for lhcb ) apparatus to be installed in run ii could be used to measure @xmath2 mesons ( main detector ) and define rapidity gap nececcesary for diffractive production ( velo and/or herschel ) . on the other hand atlas and cms collaboration could use alfa and totem detectors to measure forward protons",
    ". then different additional differential distributions are possible .",
