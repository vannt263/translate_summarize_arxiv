    "the original bcs state for superconductors considers pairing between two species of fermions with equal populations . for a long time , theorists studied the fermion system with unequal species , or mismatched fermi surfaces , and proposed this system may have different ground state @xcite , in particular the so called fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase .",
    "experimentally , however , such superfluid states remain unclear because of the difficulty in preparing the magnetized superconductors .",
    "experiments with ultra - cold atoms have opened a new era to study this fermion system with unequal populations . through the feshbach resonance @xcite , the effective interaction between atoms can be varied over a wide range such that the ground state can be turned from a weak - coupling bcs superfluid to a strong - coupling bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) regime . in the homogeneous system ,",
    "theoretical studies @xcite of the unequal fermion species show that the phase transition must occur when the resonance is crossed , in contrast to the equal population case where a smooth crossover takes place @xcite . breached pair phase @xcite , phase separated states are also proposed @xcite in this system .    two recent experiments @xcite studied the trapped @xmath0li atoms with imbalanced spin populations and obtained the density profiles for various population differences .",
    "both groups found the system contains a superfluid core surrounded by a normal fermions and provide evidence for phase separation near the crossover .    in this paper , we study this imbalanced fermion system by mean field approximation and evaluate the density profiles for various coupling strengths from weak - coupling bcs superfluid to strong coupling bec regime .",
    "in particular , we calculate the axial density profiles , superfluid and minority cloud radii , and distinguish between the phase separation and bose - fermi mixture regimes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the mean - field approximation for the dilute fermion atoms with unequal populations . in sec .",
    "iii we present our results for various polarizations from weaking - coupling bcs superfluid to strong - coupling bec side .",
    "we show that the axial density profiles are constant within the superfluid core and decrease beyond the phase boundary for the phase separations but are smoothly decreasing functions for entire trap for the mixtures .",
    "finally , we conclude with a briefly summary in sec .",
    "while this work was in progress , several theoretical papers have also studied the same problem under similar approximations @xcite or going beyond @xcite .",
    "basically , ref @xcite also conclude the system is phase separated into concentric shells with superfluid in the center and surrounding by leftover fermions near the resonance .",
    "the strong - coupling bec limit has also been studied @xcite . in this case , the composite bosons and unpaired fermions can mix . as the population difference increases the unpaired fermions",
    "can even penetrate into the superfluid core .",
    "our paper provides a more systematic study of the entire bcs - bec regimes for all polarizations .",
    "restricting ourselves to wide feshbach resonance , the two - component fermion system can be described by an effective one - channel hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 and the index @xmath3 runs over the two spin components . within the bcs mean field approximation at zero temperature ,",
    "the excitation spectrum in a homogeneous system for each spin is ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) @xmath4 where @xmath2 are the quasi - particle excitation energies for normal fermions , and @xmath5 . for an inhomogeneous system , @xmath6 the system in a harmonic trap , a finite system sized effect should be included @xcite .",
    "however , the system can be treated as homogeneous locally if the number of particles are sufficiently large .",
    "a local density approximation , or thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) , is applied and the chemical potential for spin @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath7 with @xmath8 the isotropic trap frequency and @xmath9 the distance from the trap center .",
    "we shall show results explicitly only for the isotropic trap . in the local density approximation , the densities @xmath10 depends only on the local chemical potentials @xmath11 .",
    "hence the density profile of an anisotropic trap can be related to an isotropic one by rescaling the spatial coordinates appropriately .",
    "we then introduce the average chemical potential @xmath12\\ = \\ \\mu_0\\ -\\",

    "the physical solution is determined by the condition of minimum free energy among the multiple solutions .",
    "we describe the detail procedures in [ freeenergy ] .",
    "in this section , we investigate the density profiles for various polarizations and coupling strengths from positive detuning bcs superfluid to negative detuning bec side . with the aid of density profiles ,",
    "we evaluate the radii of the superfluid phase boundaries for various cases and compare to the current experimental results .",
    "we close this section with a discussion of axial density profiles .",
    "phase separation versus bose - fermi mixture can be clarified through the axial density profiles of the population difference .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the radial density profiles for three different coupling strengths @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( for different columns ) with polarization @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( for different rows ) .",
    "the total number of particles are fixed to @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the fermi wavevector at the trap center for an ideal symmetric fermi gas with the same total number of particles . in all these plots ,",
    "the system shows a superfluid cloud surrounded by a normal fermi gas except the case in fig . [ fig1](c ) where the system is completely in the normal state with the polarization @xmath33 .",
    "it is consistent with the experimental observation @xcite that the superfluid is destroyed by a sufficiently large population difference .",
    "we remark here however that the critical population difference @xmath34 for the destruction of superfluidity obtained here is much larger than that found in the experiment @xcite . for @xmath35 here , @xmath36 theoretically whereas an extrapolation of the data of @xcite gives @xmath37 ( see further discussions below ) . for less polarized system on the bcs side [ fig . [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) ] , it shows a clear phase separation between the superfluid and a normal fermi gas .",
    "note that within the superfluid cloud , the population difference is zero and the system is just like the typically unpolarized superfluid . outside the superfluid cloud ,",
    "both components of the fermions exist in the normal state which indicates a fraction of the fermions which are not paired - up even at the zero temperature .",
    "the density profile of the population difference @xmath38 peaks at the superfluid phase boundary and decreases gradually toward the edge of the trap .",
    "its value is equal to the density profile of the majority when @xmath39 , the radii of the minority cloud . at the superfluid phase boundary ,",
    "both the majority and minority density profiles exhibit discontinuous which has been observed also by the others @xcite .    near resonance",
    "[ fig1](d)-(f ) ] , similar phase separated states are observed .",
    "however , most of the minority are paired up in this regime such that the density profiles contains mainly the excess fermions outside the superfluid cloud at all @xmath26 s .",
    "this is consistent with the homogeneous normal phase boundary extends near resonance to large population difference @xcite .",
    "near resonance , the superfluid core survives at @xmath40 in our calculations whereas experimentally @xcite it vanishes already at @xmath41 .    on the bec side [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](g)-(i ) ] , all of the minority are paired up and the excess fermions can penetrate into the superfluid core .",
    "the system contains a superfluid core for any @xmath26 ( if sufficiently deep in the bec regime , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] below ) .",
    "the system then contains three different phases : the purely superfluid , the mixture phase , and the normal fermions from the trap center to the edge of the trap .",
    "the mixture phase extends toward the trap center as the polarization increases . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](i ) ( @xmath42 ) , the system is highly polarized and the excess fermions extend deeply into the trap center . in [ beclimit ] , we give an analytic discussion of the density profiles in the bec limit .",
    "the radius @xmath43 of the superfluid core is one of the most interesting quantities in current studies of the imbalanced fermion system @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the density profiles of the population difference @xmath38 have maxima at the phase boundaries between the superfluid and the normal fermions .",
    "@xmath43 is thus also the peak position of @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot @xmath43 as function of @xmath26 for three different coupling strengths .",
    "@xmath43 behaves quite differently above and below the resonance . on the bcs side",
    "the superfluid is eliminated when the polarization reaches around 0.65 for @xmath44 and the system becomes completely normal with mismatch fermi surfaces beyond this critical polarization . for large coupling strengths , @xmath43 is finite except when @xmath26 is exactly @xmath45 , since the superfluid is stable for any finite ( @xmath46 ) polarization in the homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "except for small ( @xmath47 ) or large ( @xmath48 ) polarizations , the sizes of the superfluid clouds have maxima near the feshbach resonance at fixed polarization .",
    "we also plot the radii ( @xmath49 ) of the minority ( spin down fermions ) cloud in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . below the feshbach resonance ,",
    "this radius is the same as the radius of the superfluid core because all the minority of fermions are paired up .",
    "however , this wo nt be true above the feshbach resonance where part of minority are not paired up in this regime . unlike @xmath43 , @xmath49 decreases monotonically as the coupling strength increases .",
    "these two radii become identical when the minority are paired up completely when the system reaches the bec regime .    due to the experimental constraints",
    ", one can not measure the radial density profiles directly .",
    "instead the axial density profiles are reported in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot the normalized axial density profiles @xmath50 @xmath51 $ ] of the population difference for different coupling strengths at three fixed polarization @xmath26 . for the cases with phase separations [ figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , ( b ) , and ( d)-(f ) ] , the corresponding @xmath50 are constants for @xmath52 and have a kink at the phase boundary ( for @xmath53 ) .",
    "this feature results from the population difference @xmath38 being zero inside the superfluid cloud ( see [ adensity ] in detail ) such that @xmath54 remains the same value as at the phase boundary @xmath55 . for a system with a mixed phase region [ figs . [ fig1](g)-(i ) ] , @xmath54 increases smoothly toward the trap center even as @xmath52 .",
    "it reaches a constant value within the cloud containing superfluid only [ @xmath6 , the cases with solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( b ) ] . at large polarization",
    "[ solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ] , the excess fermions mix with superfluid entirely for @xmath56 such that @xmath54 increases monotonically toward the trap center .",
    "the completely different features for the axial density profiles of the population difference inside the superfluid cloud can help us to clarify whether the system is phase separation or mixture .",
    "we have investigated the radial density profiles of the two - component fermion system with unequal spin - populations under feshbach resonance .",
    "the system shows a superfluid cloud in the trap center surrounding by normal fermions . in the weak - coupling bcs side ,",
    "the superfluid is destroyed completely at the polarization @xmath57 for @xmath44 . near the feshbach resonance , almost all the minority",
    "are paired up and the system is phase separated into superfluid and the normal fermions . in the strong - coupling bec side , the excess fermions can mix with the superfluid and the system contains three different phases , the purely superfluid cloud , the mixture phase , and the normal fermions from the trap center to the edge of the trap .    in particular , we emphasize the difference in the axial density difference profiles between the phase separation and bose - fermi mixture regimes .",
    "the former shows a constant for @xmath58 and has a kink at the phase boundary but the later are smoothly increasing toward the trap center .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite reported positive slopes of the axial density different profiles inside the superfluid cloud that indicates the @xmath59 need to be negative somewhere within the superfluid cloud .",
    "we do not obtain this phenomenon within current local density approach .",
    "this research was supported by the national science council of taiwan under grant numbers nsc94 - 2112-m-194 - 001 ( chp ) and nsc94 - 2112-m-001 - 002 ( sky ) , with additional support from national center for theoretical sciences , hsinchu , taiwan .",
    "to determine the minimum free energy state when there are multiple solutions , we need an expression for the free energy .",
    "we obtain this as follows .",
    "first consider a system with fixed volume @xmath60 and particle numbers @xmath61 . with the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eqh ] ) , it is straight - forward to show that @xcite the energy @xmath62 of this system obeys @xmath63 we need to eliminate @xmath64 in favor of the scattering length @xmath24 , the physical parameter of the system .",
    "these two variables are related by the expression @xmath65 we thus get @xmath66 and therefore @xmath67 writing this derivative to be @xmath68 , we then get the thermodynamic relation @xmath69 the free energy @xmath70 then obeys @xmath71 we thus conclude that , for volume @xmath60 and chemical potentials @xmath72 , @xmath73 though this expression is already sufficient to determine and thus compare the free energies of the different solutions for given scattering length @xmath24 , we can convert it to an even more convenient form . to do this ,",
    "let us write @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we get , up to an overall multiplying factor @xmath76 thus , when the solutions are plotted in the form of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the free energy @xmath77 of a state can be related to the free energy @xmath78 of another state along the same curve by , again up to an overall multiplicative constant , @xmath79 since @xmath80 is the area between the curve and the y - axis , the states corresponding to the minimum free energy at a given scattering length @xmath24 ( hence @xmath81 ) can be found via the same procedure as the usual maxwell construction .",
    "here we try to understand the behaviour of the density profile in the bec ( @xmath82 ) limit , for the special case of small number of excess fermions [ @xmath6 fig . [",
    "fig1](g ) ] .",
    "for a bulk system , it is straight forward to perform a low density expansion of the mean - field equations and obtain an expansion of the chemical potentials @xmath83 and @xmath84 as a series in the densities @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see @xcite for the details of this calculation ) . in the bec limit , @xmath87 can be interpreted as the density of the excess unpaired fermions and @xmath88 as the density of the bosons which represent the bound fermion pairs . @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be interpreted as the corresponding chemical potentials .",
    "explicitly we have an expansion of the form @xmath91 where we have dropped the terms higher order in the densities .",
    "these terms are smaller in the limit @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the value of @xmath98 is as expected for a free fermi gas and @xmath99 is the binding energy of the fermion pair .",
    "the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 here , obtained from the mean - field equations , differ from the correct values known .",
    "exact three - body calculation @xcite gives @xmath102 , while a recent four - body calculation @xcite gives @xmath103 .",
    "alternatively , defining the scattering lengths in the usual manner , our low density expansion yields the effective values @xmath104 and @xmath105 , whereas the exact values should be @xmath106 and @xmath107 . the difference between the mean - field and exact results is due of course to the approximate nature of the mean - field theory .",
    "we note however , here that ( a ) @xmath108 and @xmath109 are both positive and of order @xmath24 , hence in the bec limit we have necessarily @xmath110 , thus the fermions and the bosons can mix @xcite ; ( b ) @xmath111 for both mean - field and exact values .",
    "we shall explain the importance of this second relation below .    in the trap , eqs .",
    "( [ muf ] ) and ( [ mub ] ) becomes @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the trap potential . we shall only consider the case where the potential increases from the center of the trap . to appreciate the implications of the relation ( b ) ,",
    "consider the limit of a small number of fermions .",
    "the density profile of the bosons can then be determined by first ignoring the fermion term in eq .",
    "( [ muft ] ) , and we obtain the boson density profile @xmath114 if the r.h.s . is larger than zero , and @xmath115 otherwise .",
    "for ease of reference , we shall call these two regions  inside \" and  outside \" below .",
    "( [ muft ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the effective potential for the fermions .",
    "we obtain , for the inside region , @xmath118 whereas for the outside @xmath119 . in the inside region ,",
    "the position dependence is therefore @xmath120 . from this , it is clear that if @xmath121 , then the effective potential actually is larger near @xmath122 than near the edge of the boson cloud .",
    "it decreases from the center of the trap till it reaches the edge of the boson cloud , then it increases again due to the spatial dependence of @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for @xmath124 , the excess fermions lie near the edge of the boson cloud , at least for a small number of fermions @xcite .",
    "the excess fermions lie near the edge of the cloud [ fig . [ fig1](g ) ] .",
    "thus a peak in @xmath125 does _ not _ indicate phase separation .",
    "we here discuss some useful expressions governing the axial density within the local density approximation .",
    "our results here are , to some extent , a further development of those obtained in @xcite",
    ".    in local density approximation , any quantity , say the density difference @xmath59 , is a function entirely of the local chemical potential @xmath126 ( note that @xmath16 is a constant ) .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath127 for some function @xmath64 . we here note that any density must be identically zero for sufficiently large and negative chemical potential , and thus @xmath128 vanishes exactly for sufficiently large and negative argument @xmath129",
    ". it will be convenient to define another function @xmath130 via @xmath131    consider now for example the radially integrated density ( referred afterwards as axial density ) difference : @xmath132 the integral can be written as , for a trap that is cylindrically symmetric with respect to @xmath133 , @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "this integral can be expressed in terms of @xmath136 and thus @xmath137    this relation can be used to obtain directly the axial density in terms of the function @xmath64 , without first calculating the density profile in trap and then performing the integration .",
    "moreover , it can also be used to deduce the ( unintegrated ) density profile once the axial density is given , for example from experiment . to see this",
    ", we differentiate eq .",
    "( [ nag ] ) with respect to @xmath133 , and notice that @xmath138 evaluated at @xmath139 is directly related to the corresponding density at the coordinate @xmath140 .",
    "thus we have @xmath141 therefore the actual density for a point on the @xmath133 axis can be obtained from the axial density . under the local density approximation ,",
    "the density at any given point in the trap is a function of the local chemical potential only .",
    "hence we can obtain the actual density at any given point in space provided the axial density is given .",
    "the relation eq .",
    "( [ nz ] ) also shows that , since @xmath87 is non - negative , the axial density profile is strictly decreasing ( increasing ) with @xmath133 for @xmath142 , a result pointed out in reference @xcite . in a region",
    "where the density vanishes , then the axial density should be a constant , a result recognized in references @xcite and @xcite .",
