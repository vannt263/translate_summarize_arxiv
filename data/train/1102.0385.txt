    "sensitivity of modern large - scale laser gravitational - wave detectors @xcite is limited by two groups of noise sources .",
    "the first one comprises so - called `` classical '' , or `` technical '' noises of different origin  thermal , seismic , _ etc _ , which , in principle , can be reduced by cooling , using better materials , more sophisticated seismic isolation and so on .",
    "the second one originates from the quantum fluctuations of the light phase and amplitude inside the interferometers .",
    "these noise sources  the shot noise and the radiation pressure noise , correspondingly  obey the fundamental limitation imposed by heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite .",
    "`` naive '' optimization of the quantum noise , which simply makes the shot noise and the radiation pressure noise equal to each other , imposes a so - called standard quantum limit @xcite of the sensitivity : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the equivalent position noise spectral density , @xmath2 is the test mass and @xmath3 is the observation frequency .",
    "this limitation can be evaded using more sophisticated measurement schemes ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , which , probably , will be implemented in the third generation gravitational - wave detectors @xcite .",
    "the second - generation gravitational - wave detectors , which are under development now @xcite , are typically described as `` quantum - noise limited '' ones . however , in the best sensitivity band ( around @xmath4 ) , the noise budget will be dominated by one of the `` classical '' noises , namely , by the thermal fluctuations of thickness of the multilayer dielectric coatings of the interferometers mirrors @xcite .",
    "all contemporary and planned large - scale laser gravitational - wave detectors have the same michelson / fabry - perot topology , shown in fig.[fig : michelson ] .",
    "two arms here provide balanced scheme which suppresses the laser technical noise , and the arms orthogonal placement is dictated by the spatial structure of gravitational waves . in this topology ,",
    "transmittance of the end mirrors ( etm ) have to be as small as possible , while the input mirrors ( itm ) have to have some moderate transmittance which depends on the required bandwidth of the arm cavities ( the typical values are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the end mirrors have to have at least @xmath7 times more coating layers , than the input ones . taking into account that the coating thermal noise spectral density with good precision",
    "is proportional to the coating layers number , this means that it is the end mirrors produce the major part of this noise .    due to this reason",
    ", it was proposed several years ago to replace the end mirrors by coatingless corner reflectors @xcite or by two - mirror reflectors @xcite .",
    "later analysis showed , however , that the corner reflectors introduce significant optical losses @xcite .",
    "in addition to full - scale laser gravitational - wave detectors , several smaller scale interferometers not devoted directly to the gravitational - wave detection are under development now @xcite , with the goal of testing different aspects of future gravitational - wave detectors , in particular , new methods of quantum measurements with macroscopic mechanical objects .",
    "these devices have the same michelson / fabry - perot topology of fig.[fig : michelson ] .",
    "however , in this case , another topology can be used , which does not contain the high - reflectivity end mirrors at all : the well known mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "similar to the michelson / fabry - perot topology , fabry - perot cavities can be placed inside the mach - zehnder interferometer arms in order to increase the optomechanical coupling , see fig.[fig : mach_zehnder ] . in this case",
    ", both input and end mirrors of the fabry - perot cavities must have the same moderate reflectivities created by means of a several reflective layers , instead of tens in the high - reflectivity end mirrors , and , therefore , proportionally smaller coating thermal noise .",
    "it can be noted , that in principle , mach - zehnder / fabry - perot topology can be used in the large - scale gravitational - wave detectors case too .",
    "however , in this case the second beamsplitter has to recombine beams from the end mirrors separated by the several kilometers distance .",
    "it is unclear , whether the sensitivity gain provided by this topology justify the corresponding technological hassles .",
    "the evident difference of the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot topology from the michelson / fabry - perot one is that it has two output ports , with outgoing fields in both of them carrying information about the mirrors motion . in order to achieve a quantum noise limited sensitivity , all this information has to be captured .",
    "therefore , both dark ports have to be equipped with photodetectors .",
    "in this topology , all proposed methods of overcoming the sql can be used too .",
    "but its two output ports provide an additional flexibility in implementation of these methods .",
    "in particular , it can be converted into the _ quantum speed meter _",
    "@xcite , by adding two small mirrors into the centers of each of the fabry - perot cavities , see fig.[fig : speedmeter ] .",
    "the main advantage of the speed measurement is that it allows to overcome the sql in broad band simply by using homodyne detector with frequency - independent homodyne angle . in the `` ordinary '' position measurement case ,",
    "sophisticated schemes which provide frequency - independent homodyne angle or frequency - independent squeezing are required for this purposes @xcite .",
    "the topology of fig.[fig : speedmeter ] is simpler and more suitable for implementation in relatively small - scale prototype devices , than other proposed `` flavours '' of the quantum speed meter : doppler meter @xcite , `` sloshing cavities '' scheme @xcite , and sagnaq interferometer @xcite .",
    "however , instead of pure velocity information , it provides information about sophisticated mix of all six mirrors positions and velocities @xcite .",
    "we show here , that all the irrelevant information can be suppressed by using sufficiently small ratio of the central / end mirrors masses and proper choice of the homodyne angles of the two detectors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : pos ] , we calculate quantum noise of the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot interferometer and show equivalence of this topology to the michelson / fabry - perot one with ideally reflective end mirrors . in sec.[sec : speed ] , we consider an implementation of the _ quantum speed meter _",
    "scheme based on the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot topology . in sec.[sec : conclusion ] we resume the obtained results .    the main notations used in this paper are listed in table[tab : notations ] .",

    "consider the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot interferometer shown in fig.[fig : mach_zehnder ] . in this paper , we suppose that the arm cavities here are tuned in resonance , and the input and the end mirrors have the same transmittance @xmath8 . in this case , most of the optical power which enters the interferometer through one of the bright ports ( left in the picture ) leaves it through the second ( right ) bright port , but some small fraction , proportional to the differential displacement of the mirrors : @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for `` left '' and `` right '' mirrors , and @xmath13 and @xmath14  for `` down '' and `` up '' cavities ) , goes into the dark ports , where it can be detected .",
    "we assume here that both dark ports are equipped by homodyne detectors with the homodyne angles @xmath15 .    two additional power recycling mirrors ( prm ) , shown in fig.[fig : mach_zehnder ] , in principle , are not necessary for the scheme function .",
    "however , they allows to increase the optical power circulating in the fabry - perot cavities ( for the same laser power and for the same finesse of the cavities ) .",
    "it is shown in appendix [ app : pm ] that this scheme is equivalent to two independent quantum position meters which simultaneously measure position @xmath16 of the same mechanical degree of freedom , see fig.[fig : double ] .",
    "output signals of these meters can be represented as sums of the actual position @xmath16 of the test object and the corresponding measurement noises @xmath17 ( originated from the light shot noise ) : @xmath18    both meters also apply back - action noises @xmath19 ( fluctuations of the radiation - pressure forces ) on the test object .",
    "therefore , in spectral domain , the test object position can be represented as follows : @xmath20 , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 of the intrinsic motion of the test object , that is the one independent on the meter noises ( in particular , it can be the response on some external signal force which has to be detected ) , and @xmath22 is the susceptibility function of the test object ( for example , @xmath23 for a free mass @xmath24 ) .",
    "spectral densities of these noises : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the corresponding cross - correlation spectral densities @xmath27 are calculated in appendix [ app : pm ] , see eqs .. they have exactly the same form as in the quantum noise spectral densities of the ordinary michelson / fabry - perot interferometer , but with halved circulating power ( note that here two independent effective meters share the same optical power ) . in particular , these spectral densities satisfy the following uncertainty relation @xcite : @xmath28 with both sides being equal in the ideal case of no optical loss ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "two output signals should be combined by the optimal data processing scheme , giving : @xmath30\\tilde x_2(\\omega ) \\\\",

    "it is easy to show , if both meters are ideal quantum noise limited ones , then the same is valid for the effective combined meter .",
    "consider the symmetric particular case of the homodyne angles equal to each other : @xmath38 if follows from eqs .",
    ", that it corresponds to two identical meters :    @xmath39    where the effective noise spectral densities are equal to    @xmath40    these spectral densities are exactly equal to the ones of the michelson / fabry - perot interferometer with the same parameters , in particular , with the same unified quantum efficiency @xmath41 and the same half - bandwidth @xmath42 .",
    "but while in the michelson / fabry - perot case the inefficiency @xmath43 is created by the photodiods quantum inefficiency , losses in the optical elements , and _ transmittance of the end mirrors _ , in the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot case the last component is absent .",
    "therefore , the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot interferometer with symmetric homodyne angles is equivalent to the michelson / fabry - perot interferometer _ with ideally reflective end",
    "mirrors_.    it should be noted , however , that in order to keep the same value of the half - bandwidth @xmath42 , the arm cavities mirrors transmittances in the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot interferometer must be twice as small as the ones of michelson / fabry - perot , because in the former case , both input and end mirrors transmittances introduce equal parts into @xmath42 .",
    "consider , for example , the michelson / fabry - perot interferometer with the input and end mirrors power transmittances equal to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these values can be considered as typical ones for the smaller - scale prototype interferometer , similar to the aei 10-m interferometer @xcite , and they can be created using @xmath46 and @xmath47 layers of @xmath48 , respectively ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , eq.(2 ) of @xcite ) , giving total number of @xmath48 layers for each fabry - perot cavity equal to 23 .    at the same time",
    ", in order to obtain the same value of the bandwidth in the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot case , all arm cavities mirrors have to have transmittance equal to @xmath49 , which corresponds to 6 layers for each mirror and 12 layers total .",
    "this almost twice as small number of the coating layers translates to the proportional decrease of the coating noise spectral density .",
    "the quantum speed meter version of the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot interferometer is shown in fig.[fig : speedmeter ] .",
    "it differs from the previous scheme by two additional small mirrors located in the centers of the fabry - perot cavities .",
    "both surfaces of these mirrors should have reflective coatings with the transmittances equal to one of the fabry - perot cavities main mirrors , and the short fabry - perot etalons formed thus inside the additional mirrors should be tuned in anti - resonance : the optical length shall be equal to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an integer .",
    "quantum noise of this configuration is calculated in appendix [ app : sm ] .",
    "it is shown , that it is equivalent to the generalized scheme shown in fig.[fig : sp_double ] . here two independent meters ( which correspond to two dark ports of fig.[fig : speedmeter ] ) interact simultaneously with two mechanical degrees of freedoms , which correspond to the following mechanical modes : @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( subscripts @xmath11 , @xmath54 , @xmath12 stand for `` left '' , `` central '' , `` right '' mirrors , and @xmath13 and @xmath14  for `` down '' and `` up '' cavities ) .",
    "effective masses of these degrees of freedom are equal to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , correspondingly .    in spectral picture ,",
    "output signals of these two meters can be represented as follows : @xmath57 where    [ sm_xy ] @xmath58    and @xmath59 are the measurement noises .",
    "correspondingly , both meters together create two fluctuational forces acting on the test objects :    [ sm_f_fl_xy ] @xmath60    where @xmath61 are the back - action noises .",
    "spectral densities @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the noises @xmath64 and @xmath65 , together with the cross - correlation spectral densities @xmath66 [ see eqs . ]",
    "satisfy the standard uncertainty relation similar to , @xmath67 again with the exact equality in the no - losses case of @xmath68 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    ", that the first meter provides information about the position of the `` @xmath16 '' degree of freedom and velocity of the `` @xmath69 '' degree of freedom , and the second meter  about the velocity of the `` @xmath16 '' degree of freedom and position of the `` @xmath69 '' degree of freedom .",
    "in order to implement the quantum speed meter regime , the position information has to be suppressed .",
    "it can be done in the following way .",
    "first , suppose that the end mirrors are very heavy compared to the central ones : @xmath70 ( the general case of finite masses ratio will be considered below ) . in this case ,",
    "the end mirrors can be treated as fixed ones , @xmath71 , and the measurement scheme reduces to the one considered in the previous section : two meters and one test object , see fig.[fig : double ] , with the noise spectral densities equal to : @xmath72 thus , only one source of undesirable information remains : the first meter providing position information about the `` @xmath16 '' degree of freedom .",
    "then , suppose that the first homodyne detector measures the amplitude quadrature of the outgoing light , which corresponds to the homodyne angle @xmath73 this means that the first meter does not `` see '' the input signal , but instead `` sees '' its own back action force .",
    "its noise spectral densities in this case have the following structure : @xmath74 substitution of eqs.([sm_no_m ] , [ virt_mirr ] ) into eqs .",
    "gives the following effective spectral densities :    [ sm_s_eff ] @xmath75    they are almost exactly equal to the spectral densities of the second meter alone .",
    "the only difference is the small term in eq .",
    "proportional to the quantum inefficiency @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the first meter with its undesirable ( position measurement ) noises structure is virtually excluded from the measurement process : due to the homodyne angle setting , it does not provide any information about the test object motion , and the optimal data processing procedure almost completely removes the results of the first meter back action from the output signal ( while the real motion of the test object , of course , is perturbed by both meters ) .",
    "thus , this meter plays the role of a `` virtual mirror '' which effectively closes the corresponding output port of the interferometer .    as a result ,",
    "only one information channel remains : the second meter which provides information about the velocity of the central mirrors differential motion .",
    "the sum noise spectral density of this measurement is equal to [ see eqs.([sm_s_vp ] , [ sm_no_m ] , and [ sm_s_eff ] ) ] : @xmath76      \\biggr\\ } , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath77    this spectral density has typical speed meter frequency dependence , with the optomechanical coupling factor @xmath78 being asymptotically constant and reaching its maximum @xmath79 at @xmath80 ( compare , _",
    "e.g. _ , with eqs.(20 , 21 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the following homodyne angle : @xmath81 provides broad - band low - frequency optimization of the spectral density , which gives : @xmath82    \\biggr\\ } .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that in the absence of the optical losses , @xmath83 , the residual back action noise ( proportional to @xmath78 ) can be very small at low frequencies , @xmath84 . however , similar to other speed meter implementations @xcite , the additional term introduced in eq . by the optical losses , diverges if @xmath80 and therefore seriously limits the sensitivity .    the sum noise spectral density for the general case of arbitrary masses ratio @xmath85 is calculated in appendix [ app : sm_s_sum ] , see eqs.([sm_s_sum_k ] , [ sm_s_sum_k_opt ] ) . in this case",
    ", the perturbation of the `` @xmath69 '' degree of freedom creates additional terms in the sum noise spectral density which also diverge at @xmath80 .",
    "however , @xmath85 can be easily made much smaller than the quantum inefficiency @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity degradation due to the end mirrors motion perturbation can be made negligibly small in comparison with the one caused by the optical losses .",
    "[ see eq . ] for @xmath86 ( solid lines ) and @xmath87 ( dots ) .",
    "for all plots , @xmath88 . ]    in fig.[fig : plots ] , spectral density normalized by the sql spectral density @xmath89 is plotted for @xmath86 and for the asymptotic case @xmath87 , for the following three values of the unified quantum efficiency : @xmath90 ( moderately optimistic ) , @xmath91 ( very optimistic ) , and @xmath68 ( no losses at all ) . in all these cases , the value of @xmath88 is used .",
    "if , for example , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( total arm length @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 ( these values are close to ones planned for hannover 10-m prototype experiment @xcite ) , then this @xmath79 corresponds to @xmath97 .",
    "it is easy to see , that influence of the `` @xmath69 '' degree of freedom is barely noticeable if @xmath90 , small if @xmath91 and is significant only in the ideal lossless case @xmath68 .",
    "it have to be noted that the reduced size of the central mirror requires that the beam radius on this mirrors also have to be reduced proportionally , in order to keep diffraction losses at the same level .",
    "the reduced beam radius means increased influence of brownian and thermoelastic noises of the central mirror coating and bulk @xcite .",
    "however , estimates made in @xcite show that this effect is more than compensated by the increased standard quantum limit of the light central mirrors .",
    "another potential noise source is thermo - refractive noise in the central mirrors bulk @xcite .",
    "however , due to the condition , the optical power penetrating into the central mirrors will be as small as the power inside the fabry - perot cavities end mirrors and the beamsplitters .",
    "therefore , due to the longer light path inside , it is these elements will contribute the major part of the total thermo - refractive noise .",
    "the brief estimate made above shows that in the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot interferometer , the coating thermal noise spectral density can be about twice as small as in the similar michelson / fabry - perot . taking into account ,",
    "that this gain is cumulative with the other proposed methods of reducing the coating thermal noise : in particular , broadened laser beams @xcite , better coating materials @xcite , coating structure optimization @xcite , it is quite possible that together all these methods will allow to push the coating thermal noise below the quantum noise .",
    "concerning the quantum noise , it has to be emphasized , that only two simplest configurations which do not use the advanced techiques like optical springs @xcite , squeezed light @xcite , filter cavities @xcite _ etc _ were considered here .",
    "all these methods of shaping the quantum noise , developed for the michelson / fabry - perot topology , can be used in the mach - zehnder / fabry - perot case as well , with the additional flexibility provided by the two output ports .",

    "therefore , two detectors outputs corresponds to two independent meters with the noises defined by @xmath118 .",

    "each of the arm cavities of the speed meter interferometer shown in fig.[fig : speedmeter ] can be presented as a sequence of two identical fabry - perot cavities , see fig.[fig : speedm_arm ] , top .",

    "note that while the intermediate equations depend on whether @xmath51 is even or odd , the final ones do not .",
    "odd @xmath51 will be used in the calculations below , giving @xmath125 solution of these equations is the following :                                        return to the full two - arm scheme shown in fig.[fig : speedmeter_calc ] . combining eqs . for each of the arms with eqs.([loss ] , [ bs ] ) , we obtain , that @xmath136 where @xmath137 @xmath138 [ see also eqs . ] , and the differential radiation - pressure forces are equal to @xmath139 where                similar to eq . , if @xmath117 , correspond to two non - correlated vacuum noises .",
