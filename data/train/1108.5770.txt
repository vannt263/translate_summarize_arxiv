    "in recent years a large number of experiments have been performed upon atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in double well potentials , see e.g. , @xcite",
    ". each atom can be in a superposition of being in both wells , allowing for studies of macroscopic quantum coherence @xcite analogous to that found in a josephson junction .",
    "however , in contrast to a traditional solid state josephson junction , the microscopic hamiltonian of an atomic gas is highly controllable and is very well understood .",
    "the double well system is also one of the simplest ways to go beyond the mean - field gross - pitaevskii paradigm of gaseous becs because the inter - well tunnelling introduces a very low energy scale which can easily be surpassed by the interaction energy .",
    "this tends to emphasize the discrete ( second - quantized ) aspects of the quantum state , which are conjugate to the phase properties , and can be seen in effects such as number squeezing @xcite .",
    "double well systems are , of course , also naturally disposed to being used for matter - wave interferometery @xcite , with the eventual aim of making precision measurements .",
    "in this paper we consider @xmath0 identical bosons trapped in a double well potential , and model this system via the two - site bose - hubbard model . to this",
    "we add a single impurity atom .",
    "the impurity can be an atom of a different species or internal state , but we assume that it is also trapped in the double well potential ( but need not have the same tunneling rate between the wells as the bosons ) .",
    "reference @xcite considers the related , but different , case of an impurity atom trapped in a double well potential immersed in a uniform bec as an example of the spin - boson model . in our model",
    "the bosons are limited to just two states ( two - mode approximation ) , whereas in a uniform bec there is a continuum of bosonic states .",
    "another study which is related to ours considers an atomic quantum dot acting as a coherent single atom shuttle between two becs @xcite .",
    "one motivation for studying an impurity interacting with a bec in a double well is that it can be used as a simple , yet concrete , model for studying the measurement problem in quantum mechanics @xcite : the impurity is a two - state quantum system interacting with a macroscopic measurement device represented by the bosons .",
    "the measurement device can be tuned between being quantum ( @xmath0 small ) or classical ( @xmath0 large ) .",
    "furthermore , the use of a feshbach resonance would allow the interaction between the quantum system and the measurement device to be tuned between being weak and strong . in this context",
    "we note that the interesting question of the classical ( mean - field ) limit of bosons in double well potential has been addressed in a number of papers @xcite with the general conclusion that this occurs when @xmath1 , although with the caveat that quantum effects remain important close to the separatrix @xcite , which is the boundary in phase space outside of which self - trapping occurs .",
    "a theoretical study of the same system as considered here has been performed by rinck and bruder @xcite .",
    "their paper , which focuses on the case of small atom number , predicts that when the boson - impurity interaction is strong a tunnelling resonance occurs that involves the simultaneous tunnelling of many bosons together with the impurity . in the presence of a tilt asymmetry between the two wells this resonance corresponds to the expulsion of the impurity into the higher lying well . in this paper",
    "we extend their study to larger particle numbers and consider both the full many - body theory and the gross - pitaevskii mean - field theory ( which is expected to be valid in the large @xmath0 regime ) .",
    "we find that the rinck - bruder tunnelling resonance is associated with a bifurcation in the mean - field theory solutions .",
    "although it might seem rather fanciful to study the problem of a single impurity in a bec in a double well , we note that a recent experiment @xcite has realized an optical lattice with many bosons and one impurity per site , which is quite close to the situation we are considering here .",
    "we begin by writing down the many - body hamiltonian for @xmath0 identical bosons interacting with a single impurity .",
    "both the bosons and the impurity are trapped in a double well potential ( for simplicity we shall assume in later sections that the potential is the same for both ) .",
    "the impurity is a particle distinguishable from the bosons  it may be either a boson or a fermion , but its statistics do not matter .",
    "it can even be the same species of atom as the bosons , but in a different hyperfine state provided there is no interconversion between the hyperfine states .",
    "we then make the two - mode approximation ( i.e.  the single band approximation for the two - site bose - hubbard model ) for the bosons and likewise for the impurity , so that there are four modes and @xmath2 many - body states in total",
    ".      in this paper we shall work in the two - mode approximation .",
    "for each species the ground mode is symmetric and the excited mode is antisymmetric : the energy splitting between them is determined by tunneling and is therefore exponentially smaller than the energy separation to higher modes , allowing us to isolate just the lowest two modes .",
    "even and odd combinations of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes give two new orthogonal modes which are localized , respectively , on the left and right hand sides of the double well : @xmath23 for the bosons and @xmath24 for the impurity , with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "expanding the field operators in terms of the localized modes we have @xmath30 where the mode operators for the bosons obey the commutation relations @xmath31=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath32=0 $ ] .",
    "a similar set of commutation relations hold for the impurity operators , and the boson and impurity operators commute with each other . substituting these expansions into the hamiltonian",
    "we obtain the two - mode hamiltonian , which can be written , up to constant terms , as @xcite @xmath33 where we have defined : @xmath34 as the number difference operator between the two wells for the impurity ( its eigenvalues are @xmath35 ) ; @xmath36 ditto for the bosons ( its eigenvalues range from @xmath37 to @xmath0 in steps of two ) ; and @xmath38 and @xmath39 as the hopping operators for the impurity and bosons , respectively .",
    "the parameters that appear in the two - mode hamiltonian are defined as @xmath40\\phi_{r , l }   \\label{eq : jdefinition } \\\\",

    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are , respectively , the bosonic hopping energy and difference in zero - point single - particle energies between the two wells . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the equivalent quantities for the impurity .",
    "the single - particle energy @xmath49 for the bosons is defined as @xmath50\\phi_{l , r } \\ , .\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath46 can be regarded as an imbalance or tilt between the two wells arising , e.g. , due to gravity if one well is lower than the other .",
    "note that the expression ( [ eq : twomodehamiltonian ] ) for the two - mode hamiltonian neglects small cross terms such as those that depend on integrals like @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , we shall also assume that the trapping provided by the wells is tight enough that the single - particle energies @xmath49 dominate the interaction energies .",
    "this allows us to neglect changes in the mode wave functions , and hence changes in the parameters ( [ eq : udefinition])([eq : deltaepsilondefinition ] ) , as the particle number in each well varies .",
    "let us find the matrix elements of @xmath52 in the fock basis @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the eigenvalue of the impurity number operator for the right well @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the equivalent eigenvalue for the bosons .",
    "due to number conservation , we only need to specify the number of particles in the right hand well .",
    "we find that the general matrix element is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of impurities , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "diagonalizing the matrix specified by eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrixelement ] ) gives the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the many - body two - mode hamiltonian . in figure",
    "[ fig : eigenvalues ] we plot the eigenvalues as a function of the tilt @xmath46 for the case of six bosons for both positive and negative values of the boson - impurity interaction @xmath61 .",
    "the avoided crossings correspond to places where a particle hops from one well to another as the tilt is changed .",
    "similar pictures have previously been made for the bec - impurity system by rinck and bruder @xcite , who noted that when the boson - impurity interaction @xmath61 is repulsive enough the impurity can be forced to tunnel uphill against the gradient set by @xmath48 , i.e.  the impurity can be expelled from the bec into the higher lying well .    the problem of a bec in a double well potential can be mapped onto a pendulum model , or , equivalently , a single particle in a periodic potential . as explained in @xcite , in this latter picture",
    "the tilt @xmath46 plays the role of the quasimomentum of the particle , and the eigenvalue structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvalues ] as a function of tilt can then be viewed as a band structure plotted as a function of quasimomentum .",

    "the values of the other parameters are @xmath69 . ]",
    "let us now use the mean - field approximation to calculate the equations of motion for the number and phase differences of the condensate and impurity wave functions between the two wells .",
    "the stationary solutions of these equations provide natural quantities to compare with the eigenvalue structure of the second - quantized theory because both quantities are stationary during time evolution .",
    "the relationship between the second quantized theory presented in section [ sec : manybody ] , and the mean - field theory presented in this section , is analogous to that between quantum and classical mechanics for a single particle : the @xmath1 limit of the many - body theory gives the mean - field theory , and is equivalent to the @xmath70 limit of single particle quantum theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , the precise relationship is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the classical action @xcite .    in the presence of bose - einstein condensation",
    "the bosonic field operator can be written @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the so - called condensate wave function .",

    "the equations of motion can be expressed in the form of hamilton s equations @xmath94 where @xmath76 in terms of the new variables is @xmath95 this mean - field hamiltonian function can be compared term by term with the second - quantized version given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twomodehamiltonian ] ) .    in order to gain some intuition ,",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath96 , so that the impurity and the bec are not coupled to each other .",

    "for simplicity we have assumed that the tilt @xmath103 .    when @xmath104 , the coupled motion of the impurity and the bec can be complicated ( indeed , it is expected to be chaotic ",
    "see later ) .",
    "a simplified situation arises if the bec is static , i.e.  if @xmath105 so that its tunneling is switched off and @xmath106 is locked at a particular value .",
    "we may then ask , how does the presence of the bec affect the tunneling frequency of the impurity ?",
    "the answer is , not very much . as can be seen by inspection of eqns .",
    "( [ eq : josephson1])([eq : josephson4 ] ) , the effect of a static bec upon the impurity is exactly the same as the tilt term containing @xmath48 , which does not affect the frequency of motion .",
    "in fact , if @xmath107 the impurity is completely unaffected by the bec .",
    "thus , the impurity does not acquire an ` effective mass ' through its interaction with the bec .",
    "this result probably only holds in the bose - hubbard limit considered in this paper .",
    "when the mode wave functions are allowed to be modified by interactions it is likely that the impurity will acquire an ` effective mass ' which will affect @xmath108 .",
    "let us now turn to the bec component . in the absence of the impurity , the equations of motion ( [ eq : josephson3 ] ) and ( [ eq : josephson4 ] ) for the bec correspond to the celebrated josephson equations known from the theory of superconductivity .",
    "providing the atom number imbalance between the two wells is much smaller than the total number @xmath0 ( low energy regime ) , and the inequality @xmath109 is obeyed , we can replace @xmath110 in the mean - field hamiltonian by @xmath0 to leave @xmath111 for small angles , this yields the equations of motion @xmath112 whose solutions are @xmath113 the constants @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are set by the boundary conditions , and the amplitude of the number difference oscillations must lie in the range @xmath118 .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations predicted by the above equations of motion is @xmath119 and is known as the plasma frequency .",
    "we see that , due to the interactions between the bosons , the frequency of their oscillation depends on their total number @xmath0 and hence can , counter - intuitively , be much faster than that of the impurity ( assuming all the parameters for the impurity are chosen to be equal to their counterparts for the bosons ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : mfahamiltonianbec ] ) for the bec has the same form as that of a pendulum @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the mass of the bob , @xmath122 the length of the ( massless ) rod , and @xmath123 is the acceleration due to gravity . for the case of the pendulum , @xmath124 becomes the angular displacement from the downward vertical , and it is conjugate to the angular momentum @xmath125 .",
    "the analogy between the pendulum and the bec is completed by relating @xmath125 to the population imbalance via @xmath126 .    from the position of the factor @xmath0 in the ` potential energy ' term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfahamiltonianbec ] ) , it is tempting to associate it with the length @xmath122 of the pendulum , so that @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "however , this is wrong because it implies that the frequency @xmath128 of the pendulum reduces with increasing @xmath0 , in contradiction to what @xmath129 predicts . because @xmath0 is dimensionless , we can instead let @xmath130 , where @xmath28 is a constant with units of length , e.g. the length corresponding to n=1",
    ". then the length of the effective pendulum is inversely related to the number of atoms and @xmath131 , as required .",
    "a similar approach can be applied to the more general case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfahamiltonian ] ) , where the terms @xmath132 imply a pendulum whose length changes during the motion @xcite .",
    "the length of this pendulum increases with @xmath106 .",
    "the above considerations lead us to a picture for the combined bec - impurity system as two coupled pendula with natural frequencies @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 . when @xmath136 the length of the bec pendulum is much shorter than that of the impurity pendulum so that @xmath137 .",
    "the coupling @xmath138 between the two pendula depends upon the product of the two angular momenta .",
    "this implies that we can not think of two pendula coupled by a spring , because that would lead to a coupling term that depends on the difference in the angles @xmath139 .",
    "an alternative model which does have a coupling of the correct form is the double pendulum , where one pendulum is suspended from the other .",
    "the hamiltonian for the double pendulum is derived in the appendix and can be written ( when @xmath140 ) @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the angular momenta conjugate to the angles @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",

    "in these situations the double pendulum model serves as a qualitative model which can help guide our intuition for the bec - impurity system .",
    "indeed , a well known feature of the double pendulum is that it can display chaotic motion , and we expect this to also be true of the bec - impurity system in the mean - field regime .",

    "[ fig : coherence3 ] and [ fig : eveccoherence2 ] illustrate the situation when @xmath323 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : eveccoherence2 ] ( a ) that in the fock regime we have a ground state of the form @xmath324 , where two @xmath321-function - like spikes are separated by a distance @xmath325 in fock space .",
    "although perhaps not a fully fledged schrdinger cat state , it is a step in that direction .",
    "if instead one sets @xmath326 , then one could in theory achieve the `` noon '' state @xcite @xmath327 .",
    "however , such a state would be extremely delicate and would quickly succumb to decoherence .",
    "interestingly , such a state is also difficult to compute because its energy difference from the first excited state is exponentially small and numerical diagonalization routines find them hard to distinguish .",
    "this situation is very similar to that found when computing macroscopic self - trapping in double - well systems ( no impurity ) @xcite , where split number distributions are also formed .",
    "the problem can be diagnosed by checking if the parity of the eigenstates is maintained : the ground state should have even parity in the impurity location and the first excited state odd parity in the impurity location , like in fig .",
    "[ fig : evecsig0 ] , due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "numerical errors can cause this parity to be lost when the states become nearly degenerate .",
    "one remedy for this situation is to form even and odd combinations of the ( erroneously ) computed ground and first excited states , so that parity is enforced .",

    "[ fig : coherence3 ] is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence4 ] ) . as before , the peaks in the coherence coincide with steps in the number fluctuations , and the three panels of fig .  [ fig : eveccoherence2 ] show the many - body wave function in three different regimes .",
    "panel ( b ) corresponds to the maximum coherence , which is @xmath329 , and is located at @xmath330 .",
    "the wave function at this point is remarkably wide considering the very small value of @xmath331 .",
    "the mean - field prediction for the bifurcation point is @xmath332 , which , once again , gives a good estimate for the parameter values at which dramatic changes in the many - body wave function occur .",
    "one measure of the degree of entanglement between two subsystems is provided by their entanglement entropy .",
    "this can be calculated from the reduced density matrix for either subsystem .",
    "the reduced density matrix for the bosons is defined to be @xmath333 where @xmath334 is the many - body wave function in the joint number basis @xmath335 .",
    "one finds that @xmath336 the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix for the bosons in the number basis are thus @xmath337 the entanglement entropy @xmath338 is defined in terms of the reduced density matrix as @xmath339 where @xmath340 are the eigenvalues of @xmath341 .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the bosons is the same as that of the equivalent quantity for the impurity @xmath342 where the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix for the impurity are @xmath343 because of the equality of @xmath344 and @xmath345 , we shall refer to the entanglement entropy simply as s rather than @xmath338 or @xmath346 .     as a function of @xmath61 for @xmath244 and @xmath161 .",
    "the solid orange curve is for zero tilt @xmath347 , and the dashed blue curve is for finite tilt @xmath348 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] we plot the entanglement entropy of the ground state as a function of @xmath61 for @xmath244 .",
    "the solid orange curve is for a perfectly balanced double well and the dashed blue curve is for a tilted double well with @xmath348 . in both cases",
    "the entropy is zero at @xmath96 , because there is no entanglement when the boson - impurity interaction vanishes , but the two curves display very different behavior for large @xmath349 . for the balanced case",
    "the entanglement entropy approaches @xmath350 as @xmath351 because in that regime the bosonic ground state probability distribution in fock space tends to two @xmath321-function peaks at @xmath352 and @xmath353 for both the repulsive and attractive cases .",
    "therefore , the system can occupy two states each having a probability of 0.5 and the entropy becomes @xmath354 . in the tilted case",
    "the ground state tends to a single @xmath321-function peak in bosonic fock space as @xmath351 and therefore the entanglement entropy tends to zero in those limits .",
    "of course , the tilt can never be precisely zero in an experiment and so in reality we always expect @xmath355 if the limit @xmath351 can be achieved .",
    "however , as the tilt becomes small the value of @xmath356 required for the system to become sensitive to a finite value of @xmath46 or @xmath48 becomes large .",
    "once again , it is interesting to ask whether the mean - field prediction for the bifurcation point given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : loopcondition ] ) bears any relevance to the many - body results .",
    "for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] , we find that @xmath357 ( this result is only for the zero tilt case )",
    ". these values do not correspond to any obvious features on the solid orange curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] , but we note that the first derivative of this curve with respect to @xmath61 has extrema close by at @xmath358 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects a single impurity can have upon a bec in a double well potential , with the emphasis placed upon reconciling the many - body and mean - field descriptions .",
    "the mean - field theory is nonlinear ( indeed , our system is analogous to a double pendulum , which is known to be chaotic ) and the static solutions undergo bifurcations as parameters such as the tilt @xmath46 , and the boson - impurity interaction @xmath61 , are varied .",
    "in particular , the lowest lying mean - field solution ( corresponding to both pendula pointing down ) undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation when @xmath61 is increased past a critical value @xmath172 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : loopcondition ] ) .",
    "this bifurcation is due to the spontaneous formation of an imbalance in the number of atoms in the two wells .",
    "considered as a function of the tilt between the two wells , the bifurcated solutions form a swallowtail loop in the lowest lying mean - field solution .",
    "this critical value of the boson - impurity interaction need not be large : taking numbers from the experiments @xcite and @xcite and extrapolating them to include an impurity allows one to estimate that @xmath359 .",
    "the bifurcation in the lowest lying mean - field solution corresponds , in the many - body theory , to a splitting of the ground state atom number probability distribution into two separate pieces .",
    "one piece corresponds to the impurity being in the left well and an increased ( for positive values of @xmath61 ) or decreased ( for negative values of @xmath61 ) number of bosons in the right well , and vice versa for the other piece . unlike the mean - field solution ,",
    "the many - body solution is in general a superposition of both cases ( at least until decoherence is added into the model ) , and in the large @xmath61 limit takes the form of a schrdinger cat state .",
    "the presence of the impurity can have a dramatic effect on the coherence @xmath166 of the bosons between the two wells : at the bifurcation @xmath166 is strongly peaked , even for exceedingly small values of the bosonic hopping energy @xmath45 .",
    "this phenomenon provides a readily verifiable experimental signature of the presence of the bifurcation .",
    "a single particle tunneling between the two wells can therefore drive the system into a coherent state @xcite .",
    "however , either side of the bifurcation @xmath166 returns to the very low background level set by @xmath45 , and , surprisingly , this is true even when @xmath47 is very large so that the impurity is highly mobile . it is conceivable that the high coherence at the bifurcation in a bec - impurity system could be usefully employed in interferometry @xcite , where one wants both high coherence and yet also small number fluctuations ( because the boson - boson interactions mean that different boson numbers in the wells lead to different mean - field shifts ) .    from the quantum measurement theory perspective , the formation of a schrdinger cat state is necessary if the bec is to act as a macroscopic device that measures the position of the microscopic impurity .",
    "for , only then can the bec unambiguously distinguish between the impurity being in the left and right wells ( the schrdinger cat state is assumed to collapse onto one of its two composite states under the influence of an environment ) .",
    "given that the bifurcation heralds the splitting of the number distribution , it is interesting to inquire about the fate of the bifurcation in the macroscopic ( large @xmath0 ) limit .",
    "examining eq .",
    "( [ eq : loopcondition ] ) , we see that if @xmath360 , then @xmath172 tends to the value @xmath361 which is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this expression bears a resemblance to eq .",
    "( [ eq : plasmafrequency ] ) for the plasma frequency , which gives the energy of the first excited state of a bec in a double well in the same limit , except that @xmath45 has been replaced by @xmath47 and @xmath0 has been set to unity .    taken at face value , eq .",
    "( [ eq : loopconditionninfinite ] ) seems to imply the nonsensical result that a single impurity with a finite interaction @xmath61 can have a finite effect on an infinitely large system .",
    "however , this interpretation is misleading .",
    "in particular , eq .",
    "( [ eq : loopconditionninfinite ] ) is written in terms of microscopic parameters and should instead be expressed in terms of intensive quantities that have meaning in the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 , @xmath362 , but @xmath363constant . to accomplish this",
    "we note that @xmath61 is the interaction energy per particle , and should properly be compared with the plasma energy per particle @xmath364 .",
    "this gives @xmath365 where we have put @xmath270 .",
    "taking the plasma energy per particle as an intensive quantity that is independent of @xmath0 , we find that @xmath172 scales as @xmath366 as @xmath1 , and thus an infinite boson - impurity interaction is required to trigger a bifurcation in the thermodynamic limit .",
