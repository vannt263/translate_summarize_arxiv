    "the evolution of large - scale structure ( lss ) in the universe probes the abundance and form of dark matter , the mean baryon density , the turnover scale in the perturbation power spectrum , and the formation processes of galaxies and clusters .",
    "observational constraints on the evolution of lss provide strong limits on structure formation theories because the sensitivity of the mass function to @xmath30 is high and because coherent structures on scales @xmath31 mpc are still in the linear regime , precisely where important distinctions can be made between competing theories .",
    "a study of this evolution is , thus , fundamental .",
    "substantial progress has been made in studying lss evolution from deep redshift surveys .",
    "the general consensus from the most distant probes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) suggests that there has been significant evolution in the clustering properties of galaxies since @xmath32 .",
    "precisely just how much evolution has occurred since @xmath33 is less certain but the data are being accumulated rapidly ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional surveys offer some key advantages over narrow , deep redshift surveys like those above .",
    "specifically , a large area angular survey subtends many galaxy correlation lengths in the transverse direction enabling many independent cells to contribute to the signal at a given depth .",
    "in addition , the power spectra derived from angular surveys are unaffected by redshift distortions , which tend to wash out small - scale power .",
    "the disadvantage of a 2d survey , of course , is that the depth sampled in a given flux range is usually broad and one must therefore deal with projection effects .",
    "observationally , mapping large areas of sky is now quite an efficient process due to the availability of large - format ccd arrays and mosaic cameras .",
    "ideally , one would like to conduct deep redshift surveys that also cover large , quasi - contiguous areas . as an initial step towards this goal",
    ", we have surveyed a contiguous 16 square degree area in the @xmath25-band using the prime focus ccd camera on the mayall 4 m at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the area is about an order of magnitude larger than any comparably deep , contiguous survey yet published .",
    "our goal is to set accurate limits at @xmath34 on the amplitude of structures now seen at @xmath35 .",
    "the study of large - scale structure has advanced primarily through the study of the moments of the galaxy distribution .",
    "these fundamental functions , which must be explained by any viable structure formation model , are determined , in part , by the initial conditions at recombination and by subsequent non - linear growth .",
    "the presence of non - zero high order moments ( @xmath36 ) provide constraints on the non - gaussian properties of the galaxy distribution and , hence , provide very strong discrimination between competing models .",
    "the first two moments , however , are essential for assessing departures from a non - evolving , poisson distribution .",
    "the combination of area and depth provided by this survey ( @xmath37 galaxies with @xmath0 ) allows us to determine the first two moments with significantly lower uncertainties than previous works .",
    "for example , the angular two - point correlation function at faint magnitudes has been measured on scales of @xmath38 arcminutes ( _ e.g. ,  _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but there is substantial scatter in the results at @xmath39 , which has lead to conflicting conclusions about the evolution of structure .",
    "a significant reason for the scatter is the relatively small ( @xmath40 deg@xmath41 ) contiguous areas used . at these scales ,",
    "one is subject to both cosmic variations in clustering and systematic corrections that are comparable in amplitude with the signal being measured .",
    "such effects are negligible for the present survey and thus enable a major enhancement to the precision and accuracy of lss and evolution measurements .",
    "furthermore , the survey supports a reliable determination of at least the 3rd and 4th moments of the galaxy distribution .    in this paper",
    "we present the @xmath25-band galaxy counts and constraints on the evolution of the two - point correlation function .",
    "an analysis of the higher moments ( @xmath42 ) of the galaxy distribution will be presented in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "section 2 contains a brief description of the observations and survey strategy .",
    "section 3 presents results for the @xmath25-band galaxy counts .",
    "our results for the two - point angular correlation function are presented in section 4 .",
    "the interpretation of our results is discussed in section 5 .",
    "we adopt @xmath43(100 km sec@xmath44 mpc@xmath44 ) .",
    "the primary goal of the survey is to use distant clusters of galaxies to explore lss out to @xmath34 . to do this reliably , the survey had to subtend at least @xmath45 mpc in at least one of the angular directions given that the local correlation length of clusters is @xmath46 mpc ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . at @xmath34 , 75@xmath47 mpc subtends @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 for @xmath51 ) .",
    "furthermore , to measure the high redshift cluster correlation function with accuracies approaching those of low redshift studies , the survey needed to contain at least 150  200 clusters with @xmath52 .",
    "estimates of the surface density of clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) are in the range 10  15 clusters / deg@xmath41 out to @xmath34 , thus an area of at least 15 square degrees was needed .",
    "additional survey size constraints were imposed by the desire to accurately measure the galaxy angular two - point correlation function , @xmath2 , on scales up to @xmath53 at faint magnitudes .",
    "this required that the survey subtend at least @xmath54 to minimize the effects of the integral constraint on @xmath2 on scales @xmath55 .",
    "these requirements , plus the desire to avoid severe aliasing effects and unfavorable window functions , led us to choose a @xmath1 survey geometry .",
    "the kpno 4 m prime focus ccd camera has a @xmath56 field of view ( 0.47 arcseconds per pixel ) ; 256 exposures were , therefore , required to survey the entire field . each pointing overlapped its adjacent pointing by 1 arcminute .",
    "local stability of the zeropoint is provided by comparing the overlap regions of any given ccd field with its neighbors . by comparing the photometry of objects in common in any overlap region",
    ", we find that we can measure the relative photometric offsets between any two images to 0.03 mag .",
    "we then solve for relative offsets of all images in the survey by a system of linear equations that minimizes the local differences between the images and their neighbors .",
    "simulations of this operation show that the local error in the zeropoint of any image is @xmath57 mag which translates to a limit on the random error in @xmath2 of @xmath58 due to frame - to - frame zeropoint variations . as roughly half of the images",
    "were obtained in non - photometric conditions , this allows us to still calibrate the survey from the photometric set of images .",
    "unfortunately , building the calibration from a set of local differences is poor at preserving a constant zeropoint over large scales . to provide for stability of the zeropoint over the extent of the survey",
    ", we used large - area calibration frames obtained under photometric conditions at the kpno 0.9 m telescope by ralph shupping .",
    "the calibration frames were interspersed throughout the survey area , and provide a check against large - scale gradients in the calibration .",
    "based on the quality of this material , we estimate that the zeropoint is constant over both @xmath59 dimensions of the survey to @xmath60 mag which translates to a systematic error in @xmath61 on a @xmath62 scale and proportionally less on smaller scales . indeed ,",
    "computation of @xmath2 in the independent quadrants of the survey yields results which are consistent with one another at the above level .",
    "we selected the field centered at 10h  13 m  27.95s + 52d  36 m  43.5s ( j2000 ) by virtue of its high galactic latitude ( @xmath63 ) , low hi column density ( @xmath64 ) , high declination ( extended visibility from kpno ) , low iras @xmath65 cirrus emission , and the absence of many bright stars or nearby rich clusters . in a survey of this size , however , it is impossible to avoid all bright ( @xmath66 ) stars .",
    "the effective area of the survey is 14.7 deg@xmath41 after we exclude those pixels in the vicinity of these bright objects .",
    "each exposure was 900 seconds in duration yielding images with a @xmath67 limit at @xmath68 and sufficient depth to detect cluster galaxies 2 magnitudes fainter than the typical unevolved first - ranked elliptical at @xmath69 this depth was essential  a shallower survey would only be sufficient for detecting the very richest @xmath33 clusters ( at @xmath70 , we are able to detect @xmath33 abell richness class 1 systems ) and would limit visibility of structure evolution .",
    "automated object detection and classification were performed using a modified version of the focas package ( @xcite ) .",
    "modifications include the use of a position - dependent point spread function ( psf ) , an essential feature for accurate star / galaxy classification in data obtained with the kpno pfccd system .",
    "extensive catalog quality assurance was performed to verify object classification accuracy and to remove spurious detections near bright objects .",
    "a detailed description of the galaxy catalog construction process is discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to provide a brief description of the star - galaxy classification procedure here .",
    "the object classification is done on a frame - by - frame basis .",
    "first , the psf in each image is determined using a set of compact , symmetric objects ( this is accomplished with the focas _ autopsf _ routine ) . to assure the code has not selected inappropriate objects , each derived psf is visually inspected and a quick comparison is made with the actual image frame to assess whether the psf template is sensible . in about 10",
    " 15% of the cases , stellar templates had to be selected manually .",
    "second , a polynomial representation of the psf variation as a function of distance , @xmath71 , from the camera s optical center is made .",
    "( specifically , we find the function @xmath72 is an accurate model of the variation in the kpno camera prior to the installation of the new prime focus corrector / adc in june 1997 ) .",
    "the optical center is determined directly from the data by mapping the stellar surface density ( using a position - independent psf classifier ) as a function of ccd position .",
    "failure to use a position - dependent psf results in a paucity of stars near the ccd edges which traces the optical distortions .",
    "finally , each detected object is classified as a star or galaxy based on fitting both an unbroadened and broadened psf to the two - dimensional object image .",
    "any object which requires a component broader than 1.3 times the nominal psf _ at the object s position on the frame _ is considered to be a galaxy .",
    "the stellar surface density derived from position - dependent psf classification shows no variation with distance from the optical center .",
    "this classification method works well down to about i=21.5 in these data ( based on running the same code on simulations ) .",
    "fainter than this , a statistical approach is needed to assess the probability that an object is a galaxy . however , for @xmath73 galaxies outnumber stars by at least a factor of 5 ( the galaxy / star ratio is @xmath74 by @xmath75 , based on an extrapolation of the star and galaxy counts measured to @xmath76 ) .",
    "hence , star contamination would not exceed @xmath77% even if one simply classified every object fainter than @xmath78 as a galaxy .",
    "we , however , do use a probability derived from the extrapolated galaxy / star ratio to classify objects fainter than @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ lognmag ] and table  1 show the differential number of galaxies per unit area per magnitude as a function of @xmath25 magnitude . also shown in figure  [ lognmag ]",
    "are the predictions from the dwarf - dominated , no - evolution models of @xcite and the counts from the hubble deep field ( @xcite ) all adjusted to the cousins @xmath25 system .",
    "the curvature seen in the @xmath79band log n - mag relationship is real  the effects of object misclassification and incompleteness are negligible for @xmath80 and have been accurately modeled and removed at fainter magnitudes as discussed above .",
    "the slope of the relationship monotonically decreases in a nearly linear fashion from the euclidean value of 0.60 at @xmath81 to 0.27 by @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ compnmag ] demonstrates how our counts compare with previous determinations . for clarity , we have normalized all results by dex@xmath83 .",
    "our counts are in good agreement with those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( cfrs ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our survey provides a homogeneous calibration of the @xmath79band galaxy counts over an 11 magnitude range ( @xmath84 ) , and actually covers more area at the _ bright _ end ( @xmath85 ) than any of these earlier surveys .",
    "this is an important step towards removing ambiguities in the galaxy number counts at brighter magnitudes .",
    "we find that the cfrs counts are systematically high for @xmath85 and the hubble deep field ( hdf ) counts are systematically high for @xmath86 .",
    "however , the errors for those surveys are large in those intervals owing to their small angular coverage and the difference is entirely consistent with the observed cosmic fluctuations in counts on scales of a few arcminutes and probable small differences in isophotal detection limits .",
    "our agreement with the hdf counts in the range @xmath87 is quite important because it suggests that both the hdf galaxy catalog and ours appear to be counting the same type of objects at least in this magnitude range .",
    "given hst s superior resolution , this would argue that down to @xmath88 inclusion of a significant population of sub - galactic clumps in the hdf counts is not likely ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have normalized the no - evolution models to match our counts precisely at @xmath66 where the models and the data exhibit the same near - euclidean slope of 0.55 .",
    "this is the most appropriate normalization location since we want to test for departures from the no - evolution assumption at cosmological distances .",
    "relative to the no - evolution @xmath89 model at @xmath23 ( @xmath90 ) , our counts are consistent with either @xmath91 mag of luminosity evolution or a factor of @xmath92 enhancement in the galaxy density .",
    "relative to the @xmath93 model at this same magnitude , our counts are consistent with either @xmath94 mag of luminosity evolution or a factor of @xmath95 enhancement in the galaxy density .",
    "while these models fail to reproduce the very faint hubble deep field observations ( see @xcite ) , they do reasonably well at brighter magnitudes and thus provide a plausible comparison in the flux regime covered by our survey .",
    "we use the @xcite estimator , @xmath96 , to compute the two - point angular correlation function . here",
    "dd is the observed number of galaxy pairs with separation between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , rr is the number of such pairs in a randomly distributed sample with identical boundaries and galaxy surface density , and dr is the number of such pairs in a cross - correlation between the observed catalog and a random realization .",
    "this is the minimum variance estimator and fully corrects for mask and edge effects up to scales approaching the survey size .",
    "our results for 9 independent magnitude slices , each based on 100 random realizations , are shown in figure  [ wtheta ] after the application of the integral constraint ( ic ) and stellar contamination corrections .",
    "the ic correction attempts to offset the artificial reduction in power on large scales that occurs when the mean galaxy density and @xmath2 are determined from the same survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the small reduction in amplitude introduced by misclassified stars is corrected by multiplying the ic - corrected @xmath2 values by the factor @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the total number of objects in a given magnitude bin and @xmath101 is an estimate of the number of misclassified stars in the same bin . since galaxies significantly outnumber stars when @xmath73 , stellar contamination effects are most significant for brighter magnitudes . however",
    ", that is precisely where the psf - based classifier works extremely well .",
    "hence we take the number of misclassified stars to be approximately equal to the square root of the number of stars in the bin .",
    "we have confirmed that the results from landy - szalay estimator are in excellent agreement with those from alternative estimators for @xmath2 such as the counts - in - cells method or the ensemble estimator . in each magnitude slice , we only include data from those ccd images in the survey that are complete to at least 0.5 mag fainter than the upper mag limit of the slice .",
    "this assures that large - scale artificial power from frame - to - frame depth variations is eliminated .",
    "the depth of each frame is determined by identifying the location of the peak object counts ( stars plus galaxies ) and then subtracting 0.25 mag .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our results for @xmath102 and the apm @xmath2 determination ( @xcite ) derived from galaxies with @xmath103 ( dashed line ) .",
    "table 2 presents our correlation function data ( multiplied by 100 for compactness ) in each magnitude bin .",
    "the data in this table have the ic and stellar contamination corrections applied .",
    "table 3 presents the median @xmath25 magnitudes , number of galaxies each subsample , best fit power law slopes , the corrected amplitudes at 0.5 , 1 , and 3 arcminutes ( interpolated from results in table 2 ) , and the values of the ic and stellar contamination corrections .",
    "the slope of the correlation function is determined from the best fit to the power law representation @xmath104 .",
    "the formal error in @xmath2 is @xmath105 .",
    "this expression produces error values which are comparable to those estimated by the statistical bootstrap method .",
    "the errorbars in figure  [ wtheta ] ( and table 2 ) include an often ignored additional error term , added in quadrature to the formal error , arising from uncertainty in the value of the ic .",
    "the ic uncertainty arises because one typically assumes a power - law form for @xmath2 a priori and thus , on large scales , systematic errors can be introduced if this is not an accurate representation of the true correlation function .",
    "we estimate this uncertainty by measuring the change in the ic as the assumed power law slope is varied by @xmath106 .",
    "strictly , these two error components are not completely independent ( and thus a quadrature addition is not completely proper ) .",
    "however , the quadrature addition provides a reasonable approximation and , for the present survey , the ic uncertainty is only important ( _ i.e. _ , becomes comparable to the formal error above ) on scales @xmath107 arcminutes .",
    "figure  [ wone ] shows the dependence of the amplitude of @xmath2 at @xmath108 scale on the median @xmath25 magnitude of the subsample .",
    "results from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are shown for comparison .",
    "we find a smooth decline in amplitude with median @xmath25 magnitude that is consistent with the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for @xmath109 , our results are also consistent with those of @xcite , although their results are systematically lower in amplitude by 20% to 45% . at @xmath110 , we differ at more than the @xmath111 level from the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results are substantially more reliable than previous estimates over the range @xmath29 because our large survey area overcomes the most significant problem faced by smaller surveys : the cosmic variance in galaxy surface density and clustering . for small surveys",
    ", these effects result in large fluctuations in the correlation amplitude and in a large value of the ic correction on arcminute scales . at large scales both of these effects depend on the average of the correlation function over the survey area .",
    "the ratio of variances expected between two different surveys is at least @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the effective angular scales of the two surveys and @xmath115 is the slope of the angular correlation function .",
    "while cosmic variance is boosted at small scales by the higher order correlations neglected in this simplified formula , the formula should be a reasonable accurate approximation for the ratio of finite volume errors .",
    "thus , relative to many of the previous surveys , the cosmic variance on arcminute scales in our survey is suppressed by more than a factor of 3 . moreover , the continuity and simple geometry of our survey together with the large number of galaxies employed ensure that edge and discreteness effects are negligible over a large dynamic range of scales .",
    "the advantage of this large , contiguous area surveys is , therefore , even better than the above estimate .",
    "in addition to the above effects , which primarily depend on the variance only , the non - gaussian error distribution for @xmath2 is likely to be skewed positively ( @xcite ) as well .",
    "this can result in an _ apparent _ low bias in the correlation amplitude for smaller surveys since there are many areas of sky with values somewhat lower than the mean , which are not balanced by the relatively few areas with values much higher than the mean .",
    "we use our survey data to directly measure the true variance caused by surface density and clustering properties in @xmath116 in many independent but small contiguous areas , and find that variance is significant on 1 arcminute scales .",
    "we chose a cell size of @xmath117  corresponding to the field of view of a single kpno 4 m ccd exposure ( which is still significantly larger than the independent fields of previous surveys ) .",
    "we analyze 250 such fields and computed @xmath2 for @xmath118 , a magnitude range where we begin to see growing discrepancy between different surveys .",
    "the histogram of @xmath116 values is shown in figure  [ wfluc ] .",
    "we find that the scatter in @xmath116 is comparable to its mean value ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "extreme values can reach @xmath120 the mean .",
    "thus , in order to measure @xmath116 with a s / n of 10 one requires at least 100 such independent fields even at only moderately faint magnitudes .",
    "there is also a 20% offset between the full survey value and the mean of the 250 independent fields , but this difference is entirely consistent with uncertainties in the ic correction for the individual ccd frame results .",
    "the ic correction , like cosmic variance , is determined by the effective survey area , and to lesser extent , by the survey geometry .",
    "the largest contiguous area used in @xmath2 measurements at @xmath121 in the other works cited is 0.25 deg@xmath41 ( compared with 14.7 deg@xmath41 here ) .",
    "the ic corrections at @xmath108 in our survey are negligible ( @xmath122 ) whereas they can be a significant fraction ( @xmath123% ) of the amplitude of @xmath2 in some of the previous surveys ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , while the agreement between @xcite and our results is excellent , their two survey fields only cover about 0.02 deg@xmath41 and , therefore , additional imaging over larger areas at fainter limits ( @xmath124 ) is still desired .",
    "the @xcite results are based on a survey of 64 @xmath125 non - contiguous fields ( 2.2 deg@xmath41 total area ) distributed over an @xmath126 region .",
    "the dependence of the angular correlation function amplitude on magnitude can be modeled using the equation ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath127 } \\over { \\gamma(\\gamma/2 ) } } { a(\\epsilon ) \\over { \\theta^{\\gamma-1 } } } r_{o}^{\\gamma } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that relates @xmath2 to the spatial correlation function , @xmath128 .",
    "a power - law spatial correlation function implies that it s two dimensional counterpart , @xmath2 , will also take on a power - law form .",
    "the function @xmath129 depends on the the galaxy redshift distribution , @xmath130 , and on the evolution of @xmath8 .",
    "if this evolution is parameterized as ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath131 then @xmath129 is @xmath132^{-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 , the angular diameter distance , and @xmath134 are @xmath135 in this parameterization , two special cases are noteworthy . clustering that remains constant in co - moving coordinates yields @xmath136 . clustering that remains fixed with respect to physical coordinates yields @xmath137 .",
    "we use several different redshift distributions in our fitting procedure ( all shown in figure  [ nz ] ) .",
    "the first is based on fits of the empirical function @xmath138 to the cfrs data and its extrapolation to fainter magnitudes ( @xcite ; hereafter cfrs model ) .",
    "this parameterization provides a very good representation to the observed data ( @xcite ) and allows one to use a smoothly varying function in the limber equation , thus removing shot noise effects present in the actual data .",
    "the median redshifts for the cfrs - based @xmath130 model are 0.095 , 0.145 , 0.260 , 0.420 , 0.540 , 0.615 , 0.690 , 0.755 , 0.810 , and 0.865 for @xmath139 mags of 16.5 , 17.5 , 18.5 , 19.5 , 20.5 , 21.25 , 21.75 , 22.25 , 22.75 , and 23.25 , respectively .",
    "the remaining @xmath130 models are generated by integrating an evolving schechter luminosity function in successive redshift shells ( hereafter evlf models ) and within magnitude limits that correspond to our chosen subsamples .",
    "the evolution is assumed to be a pure luminosity evolution as represented by the schechter lf parameters @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "the @xmath143 values were chosen to approximately bracket the cfrs model .",
    "all the models contain a significant fraction of high-@xmath144 galaxies by @xmath82 : @xmath145% with @xmath24 and @xmath146% with @xmath147 for the evlf models ; 44% with @xmath24 and 11% with @xmath147 for the cfrs model .    for each @xmath130 model , we find the best - fit to our @xmath116 vs @xmath25 magnitude data by identifying the combination of @xmath14 and @xmath15 that minimize the @xmath148 statistic .",
    "table 4 and figures  [ wonefits ] and [ chisqr ] summarize the results of the fitting procedure .",
    "the best fit in the range @xmath149 using the cfrs @xmath130 model gives @xmath150 mpc and @xmath151 . the best fits for the evlf @xmath130 models are @xmath152 @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 for @xmath1561 , 1.5 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "if we fix the correlation length to be @xmath157 mpc , a value that is typical of that found from local redshift surveys ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the best fit @xmath15 values fall in the range @xmath158 . restricting the fits to data with @xmath12 , in general , also yields more positive @xmath15 values and higher correlation lengths that are consistent with those from the above local redshift surveys ( see columns 3 and 5 in table 4 ) .",
    "fits to data in subsets between @xmath159 and @xmath23 are consistent with the results obtained using all data with @xmath160 . in other words , we see little change in the correlation length with magnitude for @xmath161 for a given redshift distribution .",
    "all fits were done assuming a slope of @xmath162 and q@xmath163 ( for q@xmath164 the best fit @xmath14 values are @xmath165% lower ) .",
    "figure  [ chisqr ] shows the reduced @xmath148 contours for the four @xmath130 models as functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "two things are clear from the @xmath148 measurements . first , there is a significant covariance between @xmath14 and @xmath15  for a given redshift distribution , lower correlation lengths are coupled with lower @xmath15 values .",
    "second , the best - fit is located within a fairly shallow minimum at least in the direction of the @xmath166 covariance .",
    "thus , although the best fits prefer @xmath167 , positive values are included in the @xmath168 contours , albeit with correspondingly higher correlation lengths .",
    "we provide an approximate description of the covariance between @xmath14 and @xmath15 by determining the best - fit line to the data within the @xmath168 contour .",

    "the typical @xmath168 uncertainty in @xmath15 at a given @xmath14 is @xmath173 ( for all models ) .",
    "these fit parameters are given in table 4 .",
    "our large survey allows us to perform model fits at scales other than @xmath108 .",
    "we perform a similar analyses for @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ allscales ] .",
    "figure  [ eps_allscales ] shows the best fit @xmath15 value as a function of angular scale obtained when the cfrs redshift model is used .",
    "the results for the evlf redshift models are similar shape although there is a zeropoint shift in the @xmath15 values . for @xmath110",
    ", there is a trend towards larger @xmath15 values as the angular scale decreases , perhaps suggesting that the clustering on the smallest scales evolves more rapidly .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath15 on scales greater than 10 arcminutes are substantial , however , and the trend is not seen at @xmath80 .",
    "we show in the following section that there is a significant flattening of the slope of the correlation function when @xmath110 as well .",
    "these two trends are not easily identified with any known observational or instrumental effects ( see discussion below ) but clearly a deeper , wide area survey is needed to confirm these results .",
    "we find no significant dependence of the correlation function slope on magnitude for @xmath26 as shown in figure  [ acfslope ] . over this magnitude range and for @xmath176",
    "the best fit slope is @xmath177 . for our two faintest bins ( @xmath110 ) , a flattening of the slope on angular scales @xmath178",
    "is seen with @xmath179 for @xmath180 ( see figure  [ wtheta ] and table 3 as well ) .",
    "the trend is not explained by seeing or deblending effects as it is also seen in the subset of the data with the best resolution ( fwhm @xmath181 ) .",
    "it could , in principle , be introduced by poorly calibrated frame to frame photometric zeropoint variations .",
    "however , our observing strategy enables us to measure and correct for these variations quite well ( see  2 ) and any residual variations are not sufficient to introduce a flattening of this magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath182 bin is still 1 magnitude brighter than the completeness limit .",
    "experiments with simulated ccd data show that our object detection software is not dependent on the clustering properties of the objects . as an additional check , however , we compute @xmath2 independently for the 4 quadrants of the survey , for the single run with the best atmospheric transparency , and for each individual ccd frame .",
    "we see the flattening in these subsamples as well .",
    "one would not expect an effect introduced by zeropoint miscalibration to survive all these experiments .",
    "this dependence has been seen in two other surveys at approximately the same magnitude and over the same angular scales as seen here .",
    "@xcite report slopes of @xmath183 by @xmath184 based on two independent fields , each one covering 0.25 contiguous deg@xmath41 .",
    "@xcite find best fit slopes of @xmath185 and @xmath186 for their @xmath187 and @xmath188 samples , respectively .",
    "there is a physical model that can be invoked to explain the flattening ; we will summarize it in the next section . while it is intriguing that our results are roughly consistent with those seen in these two independent surveys done at different wavelengths , we remain cautious for now since the effect is only seen in our faintest bins .",
    "other large , contiguous surveys now underway ( @xcite , @xcite ) should provide an important check on this result .",
    "we note that the constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath15 discussed above do not change if we exclude the two faintest points from the analysis .",
    "our constraints on @xmath2 reveal a dependence of its amplitude on median @xmath25 magnitude that appears to fit the model of the redshift evolution of @xmath8 parameterized as @xmath189 .",
    "in fact , this model provides an acceptable representation of the data over the range @xmath190 if the results of @xcite are also included in the fits .",
    "the decline in the amplitude of the correlation function ( over a wide range of scales ) with @xmath25 magnitude is about 3 times steeper over the range @xmath191 than over the range @xmath192 .",
    "the @xmath130 distributions that yield good fits to magnitude-@xmath2 relation typically have about 40% of the galaxies at @xmath24 by @xmath23 , consistent with the conclusions of @xcite . a shallower decline in the amplitude of @xmath2 with magnitude for @xmath39",
    "can be induced by the reduction of the proper volume element at higher @xmath144 .",
    "@xcite use this argument to support the assertion that a significant fraction of faint galaxies are at @xmath193 .",
    "however , a high-@xmath144 cutoff can also induce similar behavior since in this case the effective depth and redshift distribution are not changing dramatically as one goes to fainter limits . if such a cutoff were introduced , as noted by @xcite , by a selection bias",
    "_ against _ the detection of high-@xmath144 galaxies a shallow decline in correlation length with magnitude would result .",
    "however , a strong redshift cutoff would also effect the number counts and the corresponding turnover in the counts is not seen ( see also @xcite ) . given the excellent agreement we find with the hdf number counts , we conclude that a selection bias of this nature is not a significant problem for our sample .",
    "taken at face value , our best fits to the above model suggest the evolution of the spatial correlation function is relatively mild over the depth of the survey .",
    "when we allow @xmath14 to be a free parameter in the fit , we obtain exponents in the range @xmath194 with @xmath195 mpc depending on the assumed redshift distribution .",
    "growth in the clustering of galaxies ( in proper coordinates ) requires @xmath16 .",
    "the 95% confidence limits are substantial , nevertheless , given the strong covariance between @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as figure  [ chisqr ] demonstrates , our data are also consistent with @xmath16 providing @xmath196 mpc . if @xmath197 then values of @xmath18 mpc are strongly rejected .",
    "as already noted , redshift surveys of local galaxies find @xmath198 mpc .",
    "the interpretation of the goodness of the fit to the above model , however , must take into account a number of additional selection effects that may mask more substantial evolution of the correlation function .",
    "it is known that low-@xmath144 galaxy clustering depends on both the morphology and luminosity of the objects being studied ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the sense of these trends is that elliptical galaxies and more luminous galaxies tend to have larger correlation lengths than spiral galaxies and less luminous galaxies , respectively .",
    "we also know that the mean absolute luminosity of the objects in a flux - limited sample will increase with redshift .",
    "the relative insensitivity of our derived @xmath14 values to @xmath25 magnitude for galaxies with @xmath199 could therefore be , in part , the result of two competing effects .",
    "as one goes fainter the mean redshift of the galaxies in the survey tends to increase . if galaxies at @xmath200 exhibit a similar luminosity dependent clustering as local galaxies and/or @xmath79band selection enhances the elliptical galaxy fraction at these redshifts then it is possible that a decrease in the spatial correlation length with magnitude could be partially offset by the tendency for more luminous and/or early type galaxies to be more strongly clustered .",
    "this could also explain the observed preference for negative @xmath15 values ( which suggests only modest clustering evolution ) .",
    "the precise evolution of @xmath15 and @xmath14 with redshift is intimately connected to the density pertubation power spectrum and the galaxy merger rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the complexity of the dependence makes a unique theoretical interpretation the observational constraints problematic . none the less",
    ", the constraints are now solidly determined on degree - scales and less down to @xmath23 from the present survey .",
    "more stringent constraints on clustering evolution will require the addition of multiple passbands or redshift data .",
    "@xcite report a marginal increase in the clustering amplitude as one selects redder passbands and posit that normal galaxies dominate the composition of fainter @xmath79band selected galaxy samples as opposed to the weakly clustered faint galaxies , that appear to dominate @xmath201 and @xmath202 selected surveys .",
    "@xcite also find a marginally significant color dependence , showing that red ( @xmath203 ) galaxies have a larger clustering amplitude than blue galaxies .",
    "@xcite find no color dependence to the clustering properties of galaxies at @xmath204 from an analysis of the cfrs data .",
    "they have also measured the spatial correlation function directly from their redshift data .",
    "they find a correlation length of @xmath205 mpc at @xmath206 which , if they are sampling a mix of galaxies similar to those in local redshift surveys , implies @xmath207 .",
    "our results are consistent with this @xmath15 range . from equation ( 2 ) , we know @xmath208 . using our best - fit results for the cfrs redshift distribution we ,",
    "thus , find that @xmath209 mpc .",
    "results for the evlf redshift distribution models yield @xmath210 mpc .",
    "the cfrs galaxies were also @xmath79band selected so any difference in results between the cfrs and our angular survey are due either to projection effects ( which tend to wash out clustering ) or the volume sampled as opposed to intrinsic differences between the galaxy population .",
    "@xcite determined the redshift dependence of the amplitude of @xmath2 using photometric redshifts derived from the hdf survey .",
    "for @xmath211 , they find @xmath212 mpc and @xmath213 however , in order to be consistent with low-@xmath144 surveys , they would require @xmath214 .",
    "they suggest , therefore , that the expression for the evolution of the spatial correlation function , @xmath189 , is not particularly good .",
    "others have made similar claims based on poor fits to the @xmath2 vs. magnitude relation .",
    "this is in contrast with the excellent fit we obtain extending over @xmath215 magnitudes ( figure  [ wonefits ] ) .",
    "we speculate that the discrepancy is caused by cosmic variance due to the small area used in previous measurements of the correlation function .",
    "@xcite note that the hdf survey subtends only @xmath216 kpc at @xmath34 ( q@xmath217 ) , a fraction of the galaxy correlation length .",
    "the cfrs is larger ( five @xmath218 fields ) but still covers a relatively small volume ( @xmath219 spans @xmath220 mpc at @xmath34 ) .",
    "hence , these surveys are also subject to the same sorts of problems associated with cosmic scatter and undersampling of lss as small area angular surveys .",
    "indeed , @xcite make a clear demonstration of this point at low-@xmath144 : even in their redshift survey of @xmath221 galaxies ( @xmath222 ) filling a volume of @xmath223 mpc@xmath224 , the density fluctuations caused by lss prevent the determination of @xmath14 by better than a factor of 2 .",
    "given that the deep , redshift probes sample roughly comparable volumes ( but with the added complication that they stretch over a significant fraction of cosmic time ) , it seems optimistic to expect reliable constraints to be determined from the existing surveys .",
    "in fact , it is quite remarkable that the values obtained from them are in agreement with the local correlation length to within a factor of two .",
    "not until much larger volumes are surveyed will the constraints on @xmath14 at high redshift be robustly measured .",
    "if the results from direct measurements of the spatial correlation function at higher redshifts are ultimately accurate , however , and assuming their sample composition is not significantly different from the low redshift surveys , then the basic model may be in need of refinement .",
    "one possible refinement , discussed in some detail already by @xcite , is to include a redshift - dependent spatial correlation function slope .",
    "this would be a natural consequence of models in which there is a scale dependence to the growth of structure .",
    "for example , if galactic scale structures grow significantly faster than structures on scales @xmath225 mpc the correlation function slope would steepen with time .",
    "this would also cause the slope of @xmath2 to flatten at fainter magnitudes on small scales and , depending on the details of the density perturbation power spectrum and the merger rate , could also result in an increase in @xmath15 with redshift on small scales .",
    "adopting the parameterization @xmath226 proposed by @xcite , implies @xmath227 which is consistent with their limit .",
    "as @xcite demonstrate , values in the range @xmath228 , are consistent with structure formation models which have significant power on co - moving scales of @xmath229 mpc but disfavor models with little small scale power such as hdm .",
    "however , since the flattening is only seen at @xmath230 , the above parameterization of the slope redshift dependence is not particularly good  there appears to be no real redshift dependence to the slope until @xmath231 .",
    "we have produced an @xmath79band selected catalog of @xmath37 galaxies for studying the evolution of structure out to @xmath33 .",
    "our survey puts new and stringent limits on the magnitude dependence of the two - point angular correlation function .",
    "the survey is the first of a new generation of deep , wide - area imaging surveys made feasible by large - format ccds and mosaic cameras .",
    "the key results presented in this paper are    1",
    ".   galaxy number counts are consistent with modest evolution in luminosity ( @xmath232 mag , depending on @xmath233 ) and/or density ( factor of @xmath234 ) .",
    "the counts are consistent with the f814w hdf counts in the range @xmath235 suggesting that the hst - based catalog does not contain a substantial number of sub - galactic components in this flux range .",
    "2 .   the two - point correlation function agrees remarkably well with that of the apm in the magnitude range common to both surveys . at the faint end ,",
    "our measurements of @xmath2 are consistent with those of @xcite , who have measured @xmath2 down to @xmath236 .",
    "the large contiguous size of our survey minimizes the effects of cosmic scatter and provides a firm determination of @xmath2 over 7 magnitudes .",
    "the amplitude of the two - point angular correlation function decreases monotonically with increasing magnitude over the range @xmath237 .",
    "the decline is well fit by a redshift dependence of the spatial correlation function parameterized as @xmath238 .",
    "our best fit correlation lengths for galaxies with @xmath12 are consistent with those from low-@xmath144 redshift surveys . at fainter magnitudes we find correlation lengths in the range @xmath239 mpc depending on the assumed redshift distribution .",
    "if @xmath197 then we strongly reject @xmath18 mpc for our @xmath13 sample .",
    "however , more negative @xmath15 values are preferred at @xmath13 , suggesting the effective clustering is not evolving as rapidly as linear perturbation theory predicts . the possible preference for inclusion of more luminous and/or early type galaxies at fainter magnitudes in the survey could explain this trend .",
    "4 .   our derived correlation length _ at _ @xmath240 is about a factor of 2 larger than that derived from the cfrs . while a complete physical interpretation of our results requires additional color and redshift data , it is also clear that the volumes sampled by existing deep , redshift probes are inadequate to properly constrain the two - point spatial correlation function to better than the above difference . if the galaxy population sampled at @xmath241 is similar to that in the cfrs , then our deprojection of @xmath8 may indeed be more accurate by virtue our reduced sensitivity to cosmic scatter .",
    "5 .   for @xmath26 ,",
    "the mean value of power - law slope of @xmath2 is @xmath242 and is independent of magnitude .",
    "we find a slope of @xmath243 is a better fit to the @xmath110 data , however .",
    "this flatter slope is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also detect an increase in @xmath15 on scales less than 1 arcminute for @xmath110 .",
    "we can identify no instrumental or software - related cause for these effects but remain cautious in interpreting the full signals as real phenomena .",
    "such trends are , however , consistent with structure formation models in which small scale power increases more rapidly than power on scales larger than @xmath244 mpc .",
