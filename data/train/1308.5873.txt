    "molecular dynamics ( md ) is a compute - intensive technique that simulates the evolution of a system on the basis of interatomic forces and newton s laws of motion .",
    "md has become a popular and successful methodology to investigate the behavior of biomolecular systems at an atomistic scale , because it provides structural information at temporal and spatial resolutions much finer than those afforded by most experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "studies routinely use md to probe the behavior of systems as diverse as solvated globular proteins , biological membranes  @xcite , transmembrane proteins  @xcite , receptor domains  @xcite , drug - protein interactions  @xcite , etc .",
    "predictivity is ensured by empirical force - fields which undergo periodic refinements in order to faithfully reproduce structural , energetic and kinetic observables  @xcite .",
    "density functions , such as number or mass densities , is one of the observables that can be derived from md trajectories . for planar systems , like biological membranes , it is convenient to project density functions along the plane s normal to obtain 1-d profiles ( figure  [ fig : lipid ] ) .",
    "the profiles can be connected to experimental observables ; for example , the distance between peaks of lipid s phosphate groups is a direct indicator of bilayer thicknesses , while electron density profiles are related to low angle diffraction and scattering data  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the density profile tool , a software package that computes one - dimensional density profiles of molecular systems .",
    "the software is used from within the open - source visual molecular dynamics ( vmd ) environment , leveraging its extensive support for file formats , interactive graphical display , atom selection syntax , etc .",
    "@xcite the plugin provides both a graphical user interface ( gui ) , which makes it immediate to setup computations , and a scripting interface .",
    "gui usage is generally convenient to perform casual inspections , because no learning curve is involved ; on the other hand , the integration with vmd s scripting environment , based on the tcl language  @xcite , makes it possible to embed calculations in more complex protocols and build on its results .",
    "profile resolution is @xmath0  .",
    "right : mass density profile computed for lipid molecules . ]",
    "other analysis packages contain command - line tools to perform density profile computations similar to the one described here .",
    "gromacs distribution , for example , provides ` g_density ` , a stand - alone executable meant to be used from the command - line or in shell scripts  @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage of not being tied to a specific graphical or scripting environment ; however , it can be limiting in three respects : first , a gui may be desirable for quick one - off computations ; second , binaries mostly require gromacs - specific file formats and topologies ; finally , performing computations in shell scripts implies a programming model in which text files are used to store intermediate results  a model which is more cumbersome than manipulating variables , the route afforded by conventional programming languages like tcl or python .",
    "assuming point - like atoms ( an assumption generally justified in classical md , see section  [ sec : limitations ] ) , the algorithm to compute density profiles is straightforward . for the sake of clarity",
    ", here we assume to be interested in the mass density profile along the @xmath1 axis , with a granularity of @xmath2 .",
    "first , the space is divided in equally - sized slabs of thickness @xmath2 .",
    "assuming orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , the slabs will extend in the @xmath3 plane up to the boundaries of the unit cell ; otherwise , they can be considered infinitely large .",
    "slabs are indexed by a ( relative ) integer @xmath4 ; slab @xmath4 will include the spatial region @xmath5 ( figure  [ fig : slabs ] ) . defining the indicator function @xmath6 for slab @xmath4 , @xmath7 the value of the density function at bin @xmath4",
    "is obtained by binning the chosen atomic property @xmath8 , then normalizing by the slab volume : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the sides of the periodic cell , @xmath12 is the @xmath1 coordinate of the center of atom @xmath13 . in the case of an infinite system ,",
    "it is possible to assume @xmath14 and obtain linear ( as opposed to volumetric ) density values along @xmath1 .    depending on whether number , mass , charge or electron number density is to be computed ,",
    "the value of @xmath8 is taken from different atomic attributes , according to table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "these properties are generally stored in the md topology file associated with the system .    .supported density function types and the corresponding value to be used for @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the atomic mass , @xmath16 the partial charge , @xmath17 the atomic number . in classical md",
    "these properties can be derived from topology files , the atom s name , and/or its type . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the behaviour of the plugin differs depending on whether the size of the periodic cell is available or not . in the former case ,",
    "the real - space volume of each slab is known , and the plugin computes the expected _ volumetric _ densities ( figure  [ fig : slabs ] ) , normalized by cubic ngstrm .",
    "following vmd s conventions , the units of measurements used are atoms ( number density ) , dalton ( mass ) , elementary charges ( charge ) or electron number , as per table  [ tab : units ] .",
    "if the volume of the unit cell is not known , or the simulation was performed without pbc , the plugin will normalize densities with respect to the bin width , thus reporting densities per unit of length .",
    "linear densities can then be normalized manually ( which can be useful e.g.   to deal with non - orthorhombic cells ) .",
    "the algorithm considers point - like atoms instead of volumetric distributions ; the tool would therefore be inappropriate to compute the density of isolated atoms with sub -   resolution ( a setup generally outside the scope of md ) .",
    "the point - like atom approximation is valid as long as the chosen resolution is coarser than the average atomic radius , or the number of atoms in each bin is large .",
    "the latter condition is commonly satisfied in the md practice .",
    "the current version of the package restricts simulations to those performed in orthorhombic boundary conditions ( either constant or variable boxes ) .",
    "it should be noted that these are the conditions used in most contemporary large - scale md simulations  @xcite .",
    "finally , the plugin should provide correct results on coarse - grained and united - atom models @xcite , such as the martini force - field @xcite , as well ; this is due to the fact that the coarse - grained topologies often contain the correct atomic properties , with the exception of atomic numbers . for electron density computations ,",
    "`` united '' atomic numbers for the various atoms types should be set manually ( e.g. 10 for an united - atom water molecule ) , because the heuristics to deduce atomic numbers is based on all - atom systems .",
    "to illustrate the use of density profiles with a realistic use case , we equilibrated a model bilayer of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( popc ) lipids in presence and absence of cholesterol in a 4:1 ratio .",
    "the hydrated membrane systems were constructed with the charmm - gui membrane builder interface  @xcite , using a symmetric composition for the two leaflets , 70   initial box size , 15   water buffer per side , and 0.15 m kcl ionic strength .",
    "the generated systems , containing approximately 35,000 atoms each , were parametrized with the charmm36 lipid forcefield  @xcite ( cross - section shown in figure  [ fig : lipid ] ) .",
    "after 1000 steps of conjugate - gradient minimization , systems were simulated with the acemd software  @xcite for 100 ns in the constant - pressure ( npt ) ensemble , holding fixed the @xmath18-@xmath19 aspect ratio of the periodic box .",
    "density profiles were computed considering the last 50 ns of each trajectory , using snapshots taken every 100 ps ( 500 frames per simulation ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] ( a ) compares the final mass distributions of popc molecules of the two systems , shown as average and standard deviations along the analysis interval . as expected , the bulky cholesterol molecules contribute to the membrane surface area interposing between popc molecules ; therefore , popc volumetric mass density is decreased by approximately 15%    second , we computed the electron density of a pure 1,2-dioleoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dopc ) lipid bilayer , prepared as above , and compared it with the experimental profile determined through x - ray scattering by gandhavadi _",
    "et al . _",
    "* figure 5 ) . figure  [ fig : example ] ( b )",
    "shows that the experimental ( solid line ) and md - derived profiles ( points with standard deviations ) are in excellent agreement .",
    "analogously , figure  [ fig : example ] ( c ) compares the computed profiles for a mixture of 2:1 dopc - cholesterol ( points ) with the experimental results by gandhavadi _",
    "et al . _",
    "( solid line )  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 7 ) and hung _",
    "et al . _",
    "( dashed line )  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5 ) ; the agreement for this heterogeneous bilayer is very good , as well .",
    "experimental profiles , originally in arbitrary units , were scaled to fit .    as a last example , figures  [ fig : example ] ( d ,",
    "e ) compare the mass and electron density profiles of a polyunsaturated fatty acid phospholipid bilayer ( 1,2-diarachidonoyl - glycero-3-phosphocholine , dapc ) and a saturated one ( 1,2-dimyristoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine , dmpc ) , both prepared as above .",
    "the profiles include phospholipids together with solvent ; accordingly , the density values outside of the bilayer region converge towards the values expected for bulk water ( dotted lines ) .          for the sake of illustration , we perform the same mass calculation of the above example , this time accessing the results through the customary vmd - tcl language syntax :    .... vmd > set dp [ density_profile -rho mass -selection lipid                          -frame_to 99 -frame_from 50 -frame_step 1 ] vmd > puts [ lindex $ dp 0 3 5 ]      # meaning dp(0,3,5 ) vmd > puts [ lindex $ dp 1 3 ]          ....    the first line performs the mass density computation ( without any graphical interaction ) .",
    "the return value of the function call , a list of two lists , is assigned to the variable ` dp ` .",
    "the next command prints the value of the density at bin 3 of the 6th selected frame ( trajectory frame 55 ) .",
    "analogously , the last line extracts the fourth element of the second returned list , i.e.  the lower coordinate of bin 3 ; ` lindex ` is tcl s list index operator ( indices are zero - based ) .",
    "the density profile tool is written in tcl and is platform - independent ; it will therefore work on any of the platforms supported by the vmd system , notably linux , osx , windows , and numerous unix variants @xcite .",
    "the source is released under a 3-clause bsd license .",
    "the latest version of the package can be obtained from the url multiscalelab.org/utilities/densityprofiletool .",
    "the archive also contains cross - platform installation instructions .",
    "package development was started while at the computational biophysics laboratory ( grib - imim - upf ) of the universitat pompeu fabra with partial support by the agncia de gesti  dajuts universitaris i de recerca , generalitat de catalunya ( 2009 bp - b 00109 ) . these institutions are gratefully acknowledged .",
