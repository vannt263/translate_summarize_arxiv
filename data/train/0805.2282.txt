    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) has been shown to be suitable to quantum computation processing@xcite thanks to the high quality factors @xmath0 of cavities , control of atom - cavity interactions and long lifetimes of rydberg atoms@xcite . in this context , the information can be stored and processed by atoms and photons representing the quantum bits ( qubits)@xcite and two approaches can be distinct : the `` microwave way '' , where photons are confined in cavities and atoms are used to carry out the information between the cavities ; the `` optical way '' , where atoms are very slow or even trapped within the cavities and information is carried out by photons@xcite . following the first approach ,",
    "a cqed scheme to obtain two - bit universal quantum logic gates has been proposed@xcite and a quantum phase gate realized@xcite , while a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate was constructed by the optical approach@xcite .",
    "these schemes use resonant interactions between two - level rydberg atoms and cavities having zero or one photon only .",
    "recently , interest has arisen to the coherent states and their usefulness to realize universal quantum computation in the quantum optics context@xcite . there , the qubit is represented by two coherent states @xmath1 and @xmath2 of @xmath3-phase difference and the quantum logic operations , based on quantum teleportation , are realized by beam - splitters , non - linear crystals and phase - shifters@xcite .",
    "apart the difficulty of performing a teleportation protocol , a drawback of using coherent states is their intrinsic non orthogonality , with the consequent request of a large photon number .",
    "this problem can be overcome by moving to the microwave way of cqed and using @xmath4-photon generalized binomial states of electromagnetic field ( @xmath4gbss)@xcite stored in high-@xmath0 cavities .",
    "in fact these states , that interpolate between the coherent and the number state , have the feature that to each state it corresponds another exactly orthogonal@xcite for any value of the maximum photon number @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , they can be efficiently generated by standard resonant atom - cavity interactions@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that universal quantum computation , that is a set of cnot and 1-qubit rotation gates@xcite , can be realized without any teleportation protocol by exploiting two orthogonal @xmath5gbss as qubit stored in cavities and dispersively interacting with rydberg atoms .",
    "the normalized @xmath4-photon generalized binomial state ( @xmath4gbs ) is defined as@xcite @xmath6^{1/2}e^{in\\phi}{|n\\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the probability of single photon occurrence and @xmath8 the mean phase@xcite .",
    "the @xmath4gbs of eq .",
    "( [ ngbs ] ) is equal to the vacuum state @xmath9 when @xmath10 and to the number state @xmath11 when @xmath12 . for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 , the @xmath4gbs becomes the glauber coherent state @xmath16 . in this sense , a @xmath4gbs interpolates between the number and the coherent state .",
    "moreover , whatever @xmath17 defined by eq .",
    "( [ ngbs ] ) is , the state @xmath18 is such that the orthogonality property @xmath19 holds@xcite .",
    "to realize our universal quantum gates we consider a rydberg atom that crosses a cavity dispersively interacting with the field state stored inside it .",
    "the atom can be thought as an effective three - level atom , with levels @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] , and the cavity has a mode frequency @xmath23 slightly different from that of the transition @xmath24 , @xmath25 , of an amount @xmath26 . the level @xmath20 , the ground state of the atom , is unaffected by the atom - cavity coupling@xcite .",
    "it is known that , if @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rabi frequency between the cavity mode and the transition @xmath24 , the effective atom - cavity coupling is described by the interaction hamiltonian@xcite @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the photon annihilation and creation operators while @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the effect of this dispersive atom - cavity interaction on a generic cavity state @xmath33 is obtained , in interaction picture , by applying the operator @xmath34 to the total atom - cavity state and gives the evolutions @xmath35    let us take the cavity state initially prepared in the @xmath4gbs @xmath36 and the atom - cavity interaction time @xmath37 such that @xmath38 . exploiting eq .",
    "( [ effectofh ] ) and taking into account eq .",
    "( [ ngbs ] ) as well as the fact that @xmath39 , we immediately obtain @xmath40 thus , the initial @xmath4gbs remains unchanged if the atom is in the ground state @xmath20 , while it is transformed to its orthogonal @xmath41 if the atom is in the excited state @xmath21 .",
    "we shall refer to the dynamics due to the dispersive interaction ( di ) of eq .",
    "( [ effectofhongbs ] ) as the @xmath3-di .      our protocols for the quantum gates will require the preparation and also the measurement of @xmath4gbss inside the cavity and it is known that for @xmath42 this is achievable efficiently by standard resonant atom - cavity interactions@xcite .",
    "hereafter , we consider two orthogonal 2gbss and identify them as basis states of a logical qubit @xmath43 , that is @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "an arbitrary qubit state @xmath46 can be prepared by the @xmath3-di above , the application of two opportune ramsey zones before and after the cavity and the final measurement of the atomic state .",
    "we recall that a ramsey zone provides a resonant interaction of an atom with a classical field ( laser ) that in turn allows the following transformations : @xmath47 where @xmath48 indicates the dependence on the parameters @xmath49 ( `` ramsey pulse '' ) and @xmath50 , which are fixed by adjusting the classical field amplitude and the atom - field interaction time .",
    "the scheme to obtain the qubit state @xmath46 requires the following steps : ( i ) the initial preparation , by a first ramsey zone , of the atomic state @xmath51 and of the cavity in the logic state @xmath52 ; ( ii ) the @xmath3-di between atom and cavity ; ( iii ) the application of a second ramsey zone @xmath53 after the atom has come out of the cavity ; ( iv ) the final measurement of the atomic state .",
    "if the outcome is @xmath21 , occurring with a probability of @xmath54 , the procedure ends successfully .",
    "if the measurement outcome is @xmath20 , the qubit state obtained is instead @xmath55 .",
    "a deterministic procedure is also applicable to obtain the qubit state @xmath56 that exploits the resonant interaction of two consecutive two - level atoms with the cavity initially in the vacuum state@xcite .",
    "we now show how a cnot gate can be realized by using 2gbss and @xmath3-di .",
    "a cnot operation requires two qubits , namely the control and target qubits .",
    "if the control qubit is @xmath9 , the target qubit is unchanged , while it is flipped if the control is @xmath57 .",
    "the final target state can be thus written @xmath58 .",
    "since the quantum gate is coherent , it also acts on two general qubit states @xmath59 ( target ) and @xmath60 ( control ) giving @xmath61    in our case , this result can be realized by the @xmath3-di of eq .",
    "( [ effectofhongbs ] ) taking the two orthogonal 2gbss @xmath62 as target qubit and the atom as control qubit , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the scheme is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnot ] .",
    "in fact , it is readily seen that @xmath65 and this transformation just coincides with the cnot gate operation of eq .",
    "( [ cnotoperation ] ) .",
    "thus , a cnot gate can be realized in a very simple way in the cqed framework by exploiting 2gbss and an opportune dispersive interaction of a control rydberg atom with the cavity field .",
    "it is known that for a universal gate operation a 1-qubit rotation is required besides the cnot gate@xcite . in the following section",
    "we will see how this 1-qubit rotation can be achieved .",
    "in this section we describe the cqed scheme to realize a 1-qubit rotation gate by 2gbss and @xmath3-di .",
    "the relevant rotations of the logical qubit state @xmath46 are those about the axis @xmath66 and about the axis @xmath67 represented respectively , in the computational basis @xmath68 , by the matrices @xmath69 these rotation matrices act on the qubit state @xmath56 giving @xmath70 where @xmath71    the rotated qubits of eq .",
    "( [ rotatedqubit ] ) can be obtained by means of the scheme sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] , that requires two cavities @xmath72 : @xmath73 is prepared in the qubit state @xmath46 , while @xmath74 is in the state @xmath52 .",
    "the protocol for a @xmath75 rotation can be described through four steps .",
    "\\(i ) _ copy of the cavity qubit state in an atomic state_. the atom , initially in @xmath20 , is prepared in the state @xmath76 by the ramsey zone @xmath53 and then enters the cavity @xmath73 for a @xmath3-di . this interaction gives @xmath77/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the atomic state copy of the initial cavity qubit state and @xmath79 is the first pauli matrix .",
    "a measurement of the cavity state is then performed . from eq .",
    "( [ copypsi ] ) it is readily seen that , if the outcome is @xmath52 , the resulting atomic state is just @xmath80 and we can pass to the second step . otherwise ,",
    "if the outcome is @xmath81 , we need to perform a @xmath79 operation to obtain the copy atomic state @xmath80 , achievable up to a unimportant global phase factor by using a ramsey zone @xmath82 .",
    "\\(ii ) _ atom rotation_. the copy atomic state @xmath80 is rotated by the ramsey zone @xmath48 according to eq .",
    "( [ ramseyeq ] ) to give @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , @xmath85 are given in eq .",
    "( [ coeffaandb ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) _ copy of the atomic state in the cavity qubit state_. the atom is subjected to a @xmath3-di with the cavity @xmath74 and successively crosses a ramsey zone @xmath53 .",
    "the total state after these interactions is @xmath86/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the desired rotated qubit state given in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ rotatedqubit ] ) .",
    "\\(iv ) _ atomic state detection_. the atomic state is finally measured with the result that , if the outcome is @xmath21 , the protocol ends successfully with a probability of @xmath54 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ copypsirotated ] ) .",
    "the rotated qubit state @xmath88 about the @xmath67 axis , given in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ rotatedqubit ] ) , is obtained by means of a protocol analogous to that described above , with the only difference that the step ( ii ) now consists of two consecutive ramsey zones @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "after step ( i ) , the action of these ramsey zones creates the rotated copy atomic state about the @xmath67 axis , @xmath91 .",
    "the protocol then ends with the steps ( iii ) and ( iv ) .",
    "we have thus shown that a 1-qubit rotation can be realized in the cqed framework by 2gbss and opportune dispersive atom - cavity interactions . within this context ,",
    "a hadamard gate@xcite can be also realized , up to a global phase factor @xmath92 , by three consecutive 1-qubit rotations , namely @xmath93 .",
    "finally , a quantum phase gate ( qpg ) can be obtained by the protocol described in this section . in particular",
    ", the action of the @xmath3-qpg on the qubit state @xmath46 is to change of @xmath3 the phase of the logic state @xmath94 , giving the output state @xmath95 .",
    "this @xmath3-qpg action is produced by the steps ( i ) and ( iii ) of the above rotation protocol , provided that the final measurement of the atomic state , step ( iv ) , gives @xmath20 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ copypsirotated ] ) with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we have shown that both cnot and 1-qubit rotation gates can be simply realized in the cqed framework by exploiting orthonormal 2gbss as qubits stored in high-@xmath0 cavities and standard cqed technics as dispersive interactions of rydberg atoms with the cavities .",
    "we have also seen that a hadamard gate and a quantum phase gate can also be implemented in this context .",
    "the cnot scheme is deterministic ( sec .",
    "[ cnotsection ] ) while the 1-qubit rotation one is conditional , since it requires the measurement of the final atomic state ( sec .  [ singlequbitrotation ] ) .",
    "these protocols differ from the ones using coherent states in the optical framework@xcite , where both a large photon number and teleportation procedures are required to realize the quantum logic gates .",
    "the practical realization of these quantum gates principally relies on the possibility to produce 2gbss in a cavity and @xmath3-di between atom and cavity . in the 1-qubit rotation scheme the measurement of a 2gbs",
    "is also needed .",
    "the generation and measurement of 2gbss in a cavity is efficiently achievable by the resonant interaction of two consecutive two - level atoms with a cavity , and it appears to be within the current experimental capabilities@xcite .",
    "the use of @xmath3-di requires an atom - cavity interaction time @xmath98 ; this is obtainable with sufficient precision by selecting a suitable atomic velocity @xmath99 , whose typical experimental relative error ( @xmath100 ) is small enough not to sensibly affect the schemes@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", the schemes proposed here to realize cnot and 1-qubit rotation logic gates should be feasible with the established cqed technologies and would provide a set of universal gates for any quantum computation processing .",
