    "there has always been search for the interior solution of spherically symmetric system .",
    "considering different methods and approximations researchers tried to find out more than several hundreds different type of interior solutions .",
    "but very few solutions made its physical acceptance in all aspects describing the system so far .",
    "however , in the present paper we have studied a spherically symmetric system of radiating star under the homotopy perturbation method ( hpm ) .",
    "this is a series expansion method used in the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations , in the present case the einstein field equations of general relativity .",
    "the method in principle employs a homotopy transform to generate a convergent series solution of differential equations .",
    "the hpm was introduced and developed by he @xcite and others @xcite .    in one of his earlier works he @xcite",
    "proposed a coupling method of a homotopy technique and a perturbation technique to solve non - linear problems .",
    "the author argued that in contrast to the traditional perturbation methods , the proposed method does not require a small parameter in the equation and the results reveal that the new method is very effective and simple . later on several other researchers have employed the hpm in the diverse field of pure and applied mathematics ( as an exhaustive appliance ) , and in physics and astrophysics ( as a new field of application ) to solve related non - linear differential equations in an extraordinary simplified way @xcite .    in connection to self - gravitating radiation model sorkin et al",
    "@xcite have examined the entropy of self - gravitating radiation confined to a spherical box with finite radius in the context of general relativity .",

    "@xcite proposed and analyzed a model for the existence of strange stars where observed masses and radii are used to derive an interpolation formula for the mass as a function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the interpolation technique has been used to estimate the cubic polynomial that yield the following expression for the mass as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 all being numerical constants .",
    "their analysis is based on the mit bag model and yields physically valid energy density , radial and transverse pressures .    however , in the above mentioned work of rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite the target object was a strange star . in our present investigation",
    "we start with the intention to develop a basic interior solution of the einstein equations valid for any radiating model under a similar expression for the mass as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "then we match our theoretically obtained solutions set with the observational results for practical validity of the model and find that our model is best fit for the brown dwarf star of e0 type .",
    "therefore , the motivation of our present work is to find the interior solution of spherically symmetric system considering radiation effects in a more general way . for this",
    "we consider a metric with unknown time - time component . by using the maximum entropy principle ( mep )",
    "we obtain an euler - lagrangian equation which gives second - order differential equation for mass of the spherical distribution .",
    "then we find out solution for mass by the homotopy perturbation method ( hpm ) .",
    "the einstien field equations are solved for density , time - time component of metric and pressures of the system .",

    "iv it has been shown in details that all the physical features in connection to brown dwarf stars of type e0 are valid with the observed features except that of stability of the model which seems partially unstable .",

    "the reason to consider these data set lies on the physical background that our target is to investigate a radiating model which is compatible with brown dwarfs which are cool star - like objects that have insufficient mass to maintain stable nuclear fusion in their core regions @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that although brown dwarfs are not stars , they are expected to form in the same way , and they should radiate a large fraction of their gravitational energy at near - infrared wavelengths .    for the above specification we plot variation of mass and density as shown in fig . 1 and 2 .     for @xmath68 and @xmath69 solar radius , width=226 ]     for @xmath68 and @xmath69 solar radius , width=226 ]      using eq .",

    "we have checked out the stability criteria given by herrera @xcite . in this approach ( usually known as the concept of cracking or overturning ) the region",
    "for which the radial and tangential sound speeds @xmath74 and its numerical value less than unity is a stable region .",
    "we observe from the plot in fig .",
    "6 that for @xmath75 there is no change of sign but up to 41800  km its numerical value greater than unity .",
    "this implies that our configuration with e0 type brown dwarf star of 0.065 solar radius ( i.e. 45227  km ) is unfortunately suffers from instability within the region of core radius 41800  km .    however , it is interesting to observe from the fig .",
    "7 that outside the core our model is potentially stable one where clearly @xmath76 and its numerical value less than unity .",
