    "unprecedented experimental control in these fields allowed to envision new realizations of strongly correlated many - body systems , which operate with light.@xcite confined light modes in coupled cavity arrays are able to tunnel between adjacent sites and thus propagate on a lattice of cavities .",
    "strong correlations in turn can be observed when a repulsive interaction between photons is present.@xcite this repulsion , which is termed optical nonlinearity , can be achieved by coupling the light modes to matter in the form of atoms or atomiclike structures present within each cavity .",
    "the interaction between the light modes and atomic like structures is achieved by means of dipole coupling . in theory there",
    "exist two major schemes to obtain this interaction .",
    "the first is to model the atomiclike structures by two - level systems , leading to an interaction of the jaynes - cummings type,@xcite whereas the second approach is based on electromagnetically induced transparency@xcite and uses four - level systems.@xcite in both cases optical nonlinearities between photons arise as the energy for adding two photons to the cavity is larger than twice the energy needed to add one photon .",
    "this behavior leads to intriguing experiments such as the photon blockade effect,@xcite where only one elementary excitation is present in the cavity at the same time .",
    "the elementary excitations in light matter systems are termed polaritons .",
    "polaritons are superpositions of both particle species , namely photons as well as excitations of the atomiclike structures . following these considerations and arranging multiple cavities on a lattice leads to a strongly correlated phase in which photons are involved . as a result ,",

    "a single cavity at lattice site @xmath2 containing @xmath0 two - level systems is modeled by the tavis - cummings ( tc ) hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the resonance frequency of the cavity , @xmath5 is the energy spacing of the two - level systems , and @xmath6 is the atom - field coupling constant ( see a single cavity in fig.[fig : tcl ] for illustration ) .        the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , create and annihilate photons in the cavity @xmath2 .",
    "the ensemble of two level systems is described by collective spin operators @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the spin raising and lowering operators . when starting from the dipole interaction between photons and two - level systems two additional terms arise in the hamiltonian , which are proportional to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , for the condition @xmath14 these terms are fast oscillating in comparison to @xmath15 and @xmath16 and can thus be neglected , which is known as rotating wave approximation.@xcite the difference between the resonance frequency of the cavity @xmath4 and the energy spacing of the two - level system @xmath5 is termed detuning @xmath17 . as a consequence of the rotating wave approximation the total number of excitations @xmath18",
    "is conserved . additionally , the total spin @xmath19 is a conserved quantity as well .",
    "the ground state of the tc model is always in the sector of maximum spin @xmath20,@xcite which will thus be considered in further calculations .",
    "the full model consists of @xmath21 coupled cavities , which are arranged on a lattice .",
    "therefore we refer to this model as tavis - cummings lattice ( tcl ) model .",
    "the tcl hamiltonian is given by @xmath22 where the first term allows photons to tunnel between cavities @xmath2 and @xmath23 . the tunneling strength @xmath24",
    "is given by the overlap integral of the photonic wave functions , which is considered to be nonzero only for nearest - neighbor sites @xmath2 and @xmath23 .",
    "the restriction to nearest neighbors is denoted by the angle brackets @xmath25 around the summation indices .",
    "the second term of eq.([eq : tcl ] ) describes the physics of the individual cavities and the last term controls the average particle number of the system , where @xmath26 is the chemical potential and @xmath27 is the total particle number .",
    "figure[fig : tcl ] illustrates the tcl model . for the tcl model",
    "the total particle number @xmath28 is conserved as well as the total spin @xmath19 of each cavity . as in the case of the jaynes - cummings lattice",
    "model@xcite the tcl model can be rewritten as @xmath29 in the forthcoming discussions and calculations we use the dipole coupling @xmath6 as unit of energy .",
    "therefore the physics of the tcl model depends only on three independent parameters , namely , the hopping strength @xmath24 , the detuning @xmath30 , and the modified chemical potential @xmath31 .",
    "in order to evaluate the boundary of the quantum phase transition from mott phase to superfluid phase and to investigate the excitations of the tcl model we employ the variational cluster approach@xcite ( vca ) , which yields the single - particle green s function @xmath32 of the physical system @xmath33 .",
    "vca has been previously applied to light - matter systems in refs .  .",
    "the basic idea of vca is that the grand potential @xmath34 can be expressed as a functional of the self - energy @xmath35 and that dyson s equation for the green s function is fulfilled at the stationary point of @xmath36 $ ] . to be able to evaluate @xmath36 $ ]",
    ", the unknown self - energy @xmath35 of the physical system is approximated by the self - energy of an exactly solvable , so - called reference , system . in vca",
    "the reference system is chosen to be a cluster decomposition of the physical system , which means that the system of size @xmath21 is divided into clusters of size @xmath37 with , however , different single - particle parameters @xmath38 as compared to the physical system .",
    "due to the approximation in the self - energy the functional @xmath36 $ ] becomes a function of the single - particle parameters @xmath38 of the reference system @xmath39 where quantities with prime correspond to the reference system and @xmath40 is the noninteracting green s function .",
    "the stationary condition on @xmath41 now reads @xmath42 which can be evaluated numerically by varying some or all single - particle parameters of the reference system . in refs .",
    "it was pointed out that the particle number of a certain particle species is thermodynamically consistent only if the corresponding chemical potential is considered as variational parameter .",
    "however , there is a formal difficulty when considering , for instance , the chemical potential @xmath26 or the energy spacing of the two - level systems @xmath5 as variational parameter since both couple to atomic excitations , which can not be regarded as noninteracting particles .",
    "generally a variation in these terms is not allowed within vca , yet , this subtlety can be circumvented by mapping the atomic excitations onto hard - core bosons , @xmath43 @xmath44 with this mapping the tcl hamiltonian is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 . in eq.([eq : jclhc ] ) we have formally added the hard - core constraint by introducing the infinite interaction @xmath47 . due to the fact that the hamiltonian consists now of noninteracting particles the variation in the chemical potential @xmath26 , which is needed to guarantee that the total particle number @xmath28 is thermodynamically consistent , becomes possible .    in our calculations",
    "we varied the on - site energies and the hopping strength .",
    "in fact only two of the three on - site energies @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath26 are linear independent and therefore a combination of any two of them used as variational parameters yields identical results .",
    "in particular , we use @xmath48 as variational parameters , which ensures thermodynamic consistency for the particle number of both particle species and thus consistency for the total particle number as well .",

    "the creation operators are replaced by annihilation operators . using the bosonic @xmath53-matrix formalism@xcite",
    "we evaluate the grand potential and the single - particle green s function of the physical system .",

    "hence , the mott phase can be considered as a stable state of frozen light . in superfluid phase , however , the polaritons are delocalized on the whole lattice and bose condense in the state of zero momentum .",
