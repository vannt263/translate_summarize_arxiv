    "spherical systems with predominance of eccentric orbits are subject to the so - called radial orbit instability ( roi ) that leads to formation of non - spherical structures . these structures are naturally associated with the triaxial bulges and bars , observed in a variety of self - gravitating systems , where the eccentric orbits could occur as a result of the radial collapse in early stages of formation .",
    "numerical simulations of collapsing systems have been carried out in aguilar and merritt ( 1990 ) , roy and perez ( 2004 ) , trenti and bertin ( 2006 ) .",
    "in addition to these non - equilibrium systems , it is of interest to study the stability of _ equilibrium _ models that are used in modelling galaxies , globular and open clusters .",
    "the stability conditions may impose substantial restrictions on the allowed parameters of models .    by analogy with the well - known ostriker ",
    "peebles stability criterion for disk systems , polyachenko and shukhman ( 1981 ) proposed a global stability criterion for spherical systems , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are total kinetic energy of radial and transverse motion .",
    "subsequently it was found that the specified range for @xmath3 is not rigorously found .",
    "in particular , a critical value of @xmath4 for generalized polytropic models was found close to 1.4 ( fridman and polyachenko , 1984 , barnes et al .",
    "1986 ) , or even 1 ( palmer and papaloizou , 1987 ) .",
    "on the other hand , osipkov ",
    "merritt models give examples of systems that preserve initial spherical shape with @xmath5 as much as @xmath6 ( meza and zamorano 1997 ) . the most stable radially anisotropic configuration ( @xmath7 ) were obtained by trenti and bertin ( 2006 ) in the numerical simulation of collisionless collapse . in the latest models ,",
    "the stabilizing effect was due to the nearly isotropic core , while large anisotropy was achieved due to a strongly anisotropic shell .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed to explain roi , among which we mention two .",
    "the first mechanism treats this instability as the jeans instability of anisotropic medium , in which the velocity dispersion in the transverse direction can not resist gravitational attraction ( polyachenko and shukhman , 1972 , 1981 ; antonov , 1973 , barnes et al .",
    "the other mechanism supported by merritt ( 1987 , 1999 ) , saha ( 1991 ) , weinberg ( 1991 ) , palmer ( 1994 ) , and others is claimed to be similar to bar formation in rotating discs described by lynden - bell ( 1979 ) : this is a _ tendency _ of some orbits to line up in the direction of the bar that leads to increase of the density and potential perturbation .",
    "a detailed exposition of the latter approach is given by palmer ( 1994 ) , who describes allowed mathematical simplifications of a general matrix equation for eigenoscillations to study instability under question .",
    "it was assumed that :    * the modes are even ( even spherical harmonics @xmath8 ) , since the stellar orbits are symmetric with respect to the centre of the system . *",
    "the modes are ` slow ' , i.e. the modes eigenfrequency @xmath9 must be much smaller than the characteristic radial frequency of stars , @xmath10 . under this condition , periods of stars will be much shorter than characteristic time of the instability , and the orbits can be regarded as separate objects .",
    "these two features certainly narrow the range of possible unstable modes compared to the more general former approach , in which the frequencies @xmath11 can be of the order of the radial frequency , @xmath12 . for convenience ,",
    "we denote the two mechanisms as ` jeans ' and ` lynden - bell ' , but the primary difference is fastness and slowness of unstable modes .",
    "besides the mentioned above restrictions , the ` lynden - bell ' mechanism assumes that a radial part @xmath13 of the eigenfunction of the perturbed potential @xmath14 is nodeless .    in what follows we analyse",
    "the spectra of radially - anisotropic dfs of the form @xmath15 to answer the question whether only slow modes , or both types of modes are possible .",
    "we imply that all unstable non - radial modes are due to roi , provided they are stabilized by decreasing the radial anisotropy . for the analysis we employ a two - parametric family of radially anisotropic models without central singularity ( polyachenko et al .",
    "2013 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the heaviside step function ; parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the energy and @xmath21 is the absolute value of the angular momentum of individual stars , @xmath22 in the distribution function ( df ) ( [ apm ] ) , the gravitational potential @xmath23 is set to zero on the sphere boundary ; the boundary radius @xmath24 , and the total mass @xmath25 are unity ; @xmath26 is the normalization constant .",
    "in contrast to the well - known osipkov  merritt models ( osipkov , 1979 ; merritt , 1985 ) , and generalized polytropic models ( cumm , 1952 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , our family of models ( [ apm ] ) have two advantages needed for correct analysis of the roi : ( i ) the central density and the potential are finite , and ( ii ) for a wide range of parameter @xmath30 , variation of parameter @xmath31 transforms the system from isotropic to purely radial .",
    "a technical advantage is that the specific form of the @xmath32-dependence of the df significantly simplifies a cumbersome numerical procedure of finding the eigenmodes .",
    "below we investigate the stability of two series of df ( [ apm ] ) with fixed values of the parameter @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "a principal difference between the two is in the energy distribution of stars : the former one holds equipartition , while the latter is mono - energetic , since @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , gelfand and shilov , 1964 ) . for highly radially anisotropic systems , models of @xmath36 series",
    "have orbits with small apocentric distances ( short needles ) confined in the centre , where the characteristic orbital frequency @xmath37 is very large .",
    "in contrast , in mono - energetic models length of all highly eccentric orbits is nearly equal , and all stars can reach the outer radius of the system .",
    "we find that this feature results in a completely different character of the instability .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide a general matrix equation to determine the eigenfrequencies , and its special form for the series under consideration . in section 3 we present results of calculations of eigenmodes .",
    "finally , in section 4 we summarize the results and discuss the physical mechanisms of radial orbit instability .",
    "in this paper , we address the problem of stability by finding the eigenfunctions @xmath13 and the eigenfrequencies @xmath9 of collisionless systems using matrix method .",
    "the method was first proposed by kalnajs ( 1977 ) for disk systems . for spherical systems we are interested in a similar matrix equation , which was first obtained by polyachenko and shukhman ( 1981 ) .",
    "details of the derivation has been repeatedly given in the literature ( see , e.g. , polyachenko and shukhman , 1981 ; weinberg , 1991 ; bertin et al .",
    ", 1994 ; saha , 1991 ; palmer , 1994 ) , so here we only present the equation and explain the notations . the equation can be written as @xmath38 where matrix @xmath39 is given by the following expression @xmath40 \\bigl ( \\frac{l \\ , \\psi ^{\\alpha \\beta}_{l_1 \\ ,",

    "this is the so - called ` lagrangian ' form of the matrix elements ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it is different from the more familiar ` euler ' form : @xmath43 which can be formally obtained by integrating by parts and discarding the boundary terms .",
    "note that ` euler ' form becomes incorrect for @xmath44 with an integrable singularity at the sub - space boundary . for our series of models",
    ", this occurs for @xmath45 at the boundary @xmath46 .    in equations ( [ eq : lme ] ) and ( [ eq : euler_me ] ) indeces @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to the expansion of the radial part of the potential @xmath13 and the radial part of the perturbed density @xmath49 over the biorthogonal set : @xmath50 the perturbations are assumed to be independent of the azimuthal variable @xmath51 , since the eigenfrequencies of the perturbations @xmath9 for spherically symmetric distributions @xmath52 are independent of the azimuthal number @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath185 is a weighted jeans frequency ; @xmath186 is a jeans frequency on the radius of localization of the perturbation ( i.e. , @xmath187 ) .",

    ".    the obtained slowness of the modes allows one to average over the motion of a particle along its orbit , and consider orbital slow dynamics rather than ordinary particle dynamics ( see , e.g. , polyachenko , 2004 , 2005 )",
    ". then the matrix equation can be simplified , and instead of the full equation based on matrix ( [ me_q = 0 ] ) , one may consider a ` slow ' equation , which is obtained from ( [ me_q = 0 ] ) by omitting all terms except those for which @xmath188 .",
    "similar simplification is used by palmer ( 1994 ) for calculation and interpretation of the instability in the ` lynden - bell ' approach . recall that for highly eccentric orbits @xmath189 , which means @xmath190 we checked the applicability of the ` slow ' approach by direct recalculation of the spectra of modes for the lower spherical harmonics ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the comparison demonstrates that difference in frequency values does not usually exceeds 1 per cent .",
    "thus we conclude that for @xmath106 series roi can be interpreted in terms of ` lynden - bell ' mechanism .",
    "this result seems suspicious in the absence of a dominant external potential , which provides a slow precession for all orbits and ensures the slow mode ( polyachenko et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate for eigenfrequencies gives the jeans frequency , or the dynamical frequency , @xmath192 .",
    "however , this is a hasty conclusion : although the characteristic dynamical frequency is of the order unity , the maximum dynamical frequency of star oscillations ` locked ' near the centre is very high . for @xmath193 series a large group of stars",
    "never leaves the centre , and despite the obtained growth rates are substantially greater than unity , they are still much smaller than the dynamical frequency of the locked stars .",
    "the slowness occurs here due to the small deviation of the potential from a harmonic form that exists in the central region .",
    "note that these modes are turn out to be analogous to slow modes in near - keplerian systems ( tremaine , 2001 ) : in both cases orbital precession rates are low , and the modes are formed due to orbit  orbit alignment .",
    "we performed an ` experiment ' to determine which particles give the main contribution to the growth rates , retaining only contribution from @xmath194 to some @xmath195 in the integrals over the horizontal line @xmath196 .",
    "our calculations confirm that the main contribution to the matrix elements comes from particles with apocentric distances @xmath197 much smaller than unity .",
    "jeans instability mechanism suggests a simple dependence of critical parameter @xmath198 , at which the system becomes stable , from the spherical harmonics @xmath8 . for a system in equilibrium @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the radial dispersion . on the other hand , assuming marginal stability one can obtain for the jeans characteristic scale in the transverse direction , @xmath201 , from the jeans criterion @xmath202 .",
    "thus , using @xmath203 , we have @xmath204 which gives @xmath205 with the exponent @xmath206 of order unity . since for small @xmath207 , @xmath208 ( polyachenko et al .",
    ", 2013 ) , it is natural to expect @xmath209 to be inversely proportional to some power of @xmath8 : @xmath210 .",

    "the filled circles show the results obtained using the full matrix equation ( [ me_q = 0 ] ) . starting from @xmath213 , the linear combination of orbital frequencies @xmath214 vanishes for some @xmath215 . due to these resonances , calculation of the stability boundaries",
    "becomes extremely time - consuming .",
    "open circles show the results of calculations using the ` slow ' equation , which are almost identical in the absence of resonances ( @xmath216 8) .",

    "the full equation gives approximately exponential decay for @xmath217 , while the ` slow ' solution decreases significantly faster than exponent .",

    "this paper analyses two approaches presented in the literature to interpretation of the radial orbit instability ( roi ) .",
    "the first one explains roi in terms of the classical jeans instability .",
    "indeed , it is natural to expect that radially anisotropic systems are ` cold ' enough in the transverse direction for the instability to develop .",
    "such an approach has been proposed in the first works devoted to roi ( polyachenko and shukhman 1972 , 1981 ) .",
    "the second approach appeals to a bar formation in disc galaxies proposed by lynden - bell ( 1979 ) .",
    "his mechanism considers coalescence of the so - called ` abnormal ' stellar orbits , for which the precession rates of stars , @xmath274 , decreases with decrease of angular momentum @xmath21 while the adiabatic invariant @xmath275 is conserved ( here @xmath276 is the radial action ) , i.e. @xmath277 . let a weak bar - like perturbation of the potential rotates at a slow rate @xmath278 .",
    "orbits having a form of nearly symmetric ovals and the precession rates close to bar pattern speed effectively interact with the bar .",
    "the torque exerted by the bar on the abnormal orbit results in a change of the orbit precession rate , so that the orbit tends to line up with the bar , contributing to the potential well , thus enhancing the bar - like perturbations .    for spherical systems ,",
    "highly eccentric orbits usually obey required inequality @xmath279 .",
    "therefore , the idea of lynden - bell can allegedly be extended to spherical systems .",
    "however , the key assumption that makes this analogy legitimate is _ slowness _ of the perturbations , i.e. perturbation frequencies must be much smaller than the characteristic orbital frequencies .",
    "otherwise , the concept of orbit as a separate united object ( instead of a set of individual stars ) interacting with potential perturbation is invalid .",
    "moreover , the orbital approach can be used to describe symmetric relative to the center disturbances only . the easiest way to explain it is to consider perturbations on a disc , which have a form @xmath280 . even @xmath281 describe symmetric perturbations relative to the center , while for odd @xmath53 signs of the potential are opposite at the opposite points : @xmath282 . in the latter case ,",
    "the potential exerts differently on either side of the symmetric elliptic orbit . note that for spherical models , the role of the azimuthal number @xmath53 plays a spherical number @xmath8 .",
    "if an unstable model violates any of these assumptions ( the perturbation is not slow , or instability is possible for odd @xmath8 ) , then the validity of the ` lynden - bell ' or , equivalently , ` slow even-@xmath283 ' or ` orbital ' ) interpretation for this model can be put into question .    in this paper , we consider two series of dfs of the form @xmath15 . in the first one , @xmath284 , unstable perturbations are indeed slow , and are possible for even @xmath8 only . in the second series , @xmath34 , the modes are fast , and instability is possible both for even and odd @xmath8 .",
    "the reason for this difference is in the properties of energy dependence of their dfs . in the model with equipartition of the energy @xmath285",
    "many stars never leave the central region ( their apocentric distances are much less than the radius of the system ) , where frequency of radial oscillations , @xmath286 , and jeans frequency , @xmath287 , are much greater than frequencies of the perturbation . in this sense",
    "unstable modes are indeed slow , and thus the orbital approach to the instability is valid .    on the contrary , in the mono - energetic model @xmath288 orbits of all stars",
    "nearly approach the outer radius , so our estimates that mode frequencies would be comparable to the characteristic dynamical frequency ( almost the same for all stars ) is proved true .",
    "hence there is no way to use the orbital approach , and the odd modes obeying @xmath289 can be excited .",
    "we conclude that the spectra of radially - anisotropic dfs of the form @xmath290 are allowed to have both slow and fast modes",
    ". however , some dfs support essentially slow modes , while others allowing for both slow and fast modes .",
