    "the symmetry energy @xmath3 appears in the energy density @xmath4 , expressed in terms of total ( @xmath5 ) and isospin ( @xmath6 ) densities .",
    "the symmetry term gets a kinetic contribution directly from basic pauli correlations and a potential part from the highly controversial isospin dependence of the effective interactions @xcite .",
    "both at sub - saturation and supra - saturation densities , predictions based of the existing many - body techniques diverge rather widely , see @xcite . we take advantage of new opportunities in theory ( development of rather reliable microscopic transport codes for @xmath0 ) and in experiments ( availability of very asymmetric radioactive beams , improved possibility of measuring event - by - event correlations ) to present results that are severely constraining the existing effective interaction models .",
    "we will discuss dissipative collisions in the low energy range , from just above the coulomb barrier up to about hundred @xmath7 .",
    "in this way we can probe in detail the symmetry energy in dilute matter .",
    "the transport codes are based on mean field theories , with correlations included via hard nucleon - nucleon elastic and inelastic collisions and via stochastic forces , selfconsistently evaluated from the mean phase - space trajectory , see @xcite .",
    "stochasticity is essential in order to get distributions as well as to allow the growth of dynamical instabilities .",
    "the isovector part of the @xmath1 has been tested systematically by using two different behaviors of the symmetry energy below saturation : one ( @xmath8 ) where it is a smooth decreasing function towards low densities , and another one ( @xmath9 ) where we have a rapid decrease , @xcite .",
    "the possibility of an entrance channel bremsstrahlung dipole radiation due to an initial different n / z distribution was suggested at the beginning of the nineties @xcite , largely inspired by d.m.brink discussions . at that time",
    "a large debate was present on the disappearing of @xmath11 in fusion reactions .",
    "brink was suggesting the simple argument that a @xmath12 needs time to be built in a hot compound nucleus , meanwhile the system will cool down by neutron emission and the @xmath12 photons will show up at lower temperature . the natural consequence suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite was that we would expect a new dipole emission , in addition to the statistical one , if some pre - compound collective dipole mode is present .",
    "after several experimental evidences , in fusion as well as in deep - inelastic reactions @xcite we have now a good understanding of the process and stimulating new perspectives from the use of radioactive beams .    during the charge equilibration process taking place in the first stages of dissipative reactions between colliding ions with different n / z ratios , a large amplitude dipole collective motion develops in the composite dinuclear system , the so - called dynamical dipole mode .",
    "this collective dipole gives rise to a prompt @xmath13-ray emission which depends : i ) on the absolute value of the intial dipole moment @xmath14 being @xmath15 and @xmath16 the center of mass of protons and of neutrons respectively , while r@xmath17 and r@xmath18 are the projectile and target radii ; ii ) on the fusion / deep - inelastic dynamics ; iii ) on the symmetry term , below saturation , that is acting as a restoring force .    a detailed description is obtained in a microscopic approach based on semiclassical transport equations , of landau - vlasov type , @xcite , where mean field and two - body collisions are treated in a self - consistent way , see details in @xcite .",
    "realistic effective interactions of skyrme type are used .",
    "the numerical accuracy of the transport code has been largely improved in order to have reliable results also at low energies , just above the threshold for fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "the resulting physical picture is in good agreement with quantum time - dependent - hartree - fock calculation @xcite .",
    "in particular we can study in detail how a collective dipole oscillation develops in the entrance channel @xcite .",
    "first , during the @xmath19 , the two partners , overcoming the coulomb barrier , still keep their own response . then a _ dinuclear phase _ follows , where the relative motion energy , due to the nucleon exchange , is converted in thermal motion and in the collective energy of the dinuclear mean field .",
    "in fact the composite system is not fully equilibrated and manifests , as a whole , a large amplitude dipole collective motion .",
    "finally thermally equilibrated reaction products are formed , with consequent statistical particle / radiation emissions .",

    "the nice `` spiral - correlation '' clearly denotes the collective nature of the mode .",
    "> from fig.[spiral ] we note that the `` spiral - correlation '' starts when the initial dipole moment @xmath40 , the geometrical value at the touching point , is already largely quenched .",
    "this is the reason why the dinucleus dipole yield is not simply given by the `` static '' estimation but the reaction dynamics has a large influence on it .",
    "a clear energy dependence of the dynamical dipole mode is evidenced with a net increase when we pass from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "a possible explanation of this effect is due to the fact that at lower energy , just above the coulomb barrier , a longer transition to a dinuclear configuration is required which hinders the isovector collective response . from fig.[fusdyn ] a slower dynamics of the neck during the first @xmath41 from the touching configuration is observed at @xmath42 .",

    "we note the dependence of the extra strength on the interplay between initial dipole moment and initial mass asymmetry @xcite : this clearly indicates the relevance of the fusion dynamics .",
    "we must add a couple of comments of interest for the experimental selection of the dynamical dipole : i ) the centroid is always shifted to lower energies ( large deformation of the dinucleus , slightly increasing with impact parameter ) ; ii ) a clear angular anisotropy should be present since the prompt mode has a definite axis of oscillation ( on the reaction plane ) at variance with the statistical @xmath12 .    in a very recent experiment",

    "the deviation from a @xmath52 dipole form can be interpreted as due to the rotation of the dinucleus symmetry axis vs. the beam axis during the prompt dipole emission . from accurate angular distribution mesurements",
    "we can then expect to get a direct information on the dynamical dipole life time .    at higher beam energies",
    "we expect a further decrease of the direct dipole radiation for two main reasons both due to the increasing importance of hard @xmath53 collisions : i ) a larger fast nucleon emission that will equilibrate the isospin before the collective dipole starts up ; ii ) a larger damping of the collective mode due to @xmath54 collisions . this has been observed in ref.@xcite and more exps .",

    ", some instabilities can show up @xcite .",
    "this can lead to 3-body breakings , where a light cluster is emitted from the neck region .",

    "we have studied again the reaction @xmath69 at @xmath63 in semicentral events , impact parameters @xmath70 , where one observes mostly binary exit channels , but still in presence of large dissipation .",
    "the wilczynski plots , kinetic energy loss vs. deflection angle , show slightly more dissipative events in the @xmath9 case , consistent with the point that in the interaction at lower densities in very neutron - rich matter ( the neck region ) we have a less repulsive symmetry term .",
    "in fact the neck dynamics is rather different in the two cases , as it can be well evidenced looking at the deformation of the @xmath71 residues .",
    "the distribution of the octupole moment over the considered ensemble of events is shown in fig.[octupole ] for the three considered impact parameters .    except for the most peripheral events , larger deformations , strongly suggesting a final 3-body outcome , are seen in the @xmath9 case .",
    "now , due to the lower value of the symmetry enrgy , the neutron - rich neck connecting the two systems survives a longer time leading to very deformed primary fragments , from which eventually small clusters will be dynamically emitted .",

    "we can predict interesting isospin transport effects for this new fragmentation mechanism since clusters are formed still in a dilute asymmetric matter but always in contact with the regions of the projectile - like and target - like remnants almost at normal densities .",
