    "this hamiltonian is commonly used to describe systems of strongly correlated electrons . among these , we mention such important examples as high - tc superconducting cuprates , manganites , cobaltites , etc . however , there is no commonly accepted method that allows to solve hubbard model for a generic value of doping .",
    "one of the most intriguing problems of the hubbard model is the question if the model captures the essential physics of the high - temperature copper - oxide superconductors . at low interaction one",
    "expects that the model exhibits kohn - luttinger superconductivity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the critical temperature in such a regime is very small .",
    "thus , it is necessary to study the hubbard model at moderate or large interaction strengths .",
    "such a regime is tractable only when the concentration of electrons is low @xcite .",
    "however , the electron concentration for all known copper - oxide superconductors is close to one electron per unit cell .",
    "little rigorous knowledge is available for this limit .",
    "different approaches return quite controversial answers : some monte carlo ( mc ) studies argue against superconductivity @xcite , or against high-@xmath16 superconductivity @xcite in hubbard model , other numerical works favor existence of the superconducting ground state with high condensation energy @xcite .    in the moderate and strong coupling limits there is no guidance from analytical studies as well",
    ": in this parameter region the majority of theoretical methods become unreliable . thus",
    ", one is forced to utilize uncontrollable devices with unknown accuracy .",
    "in such a situation it appears useful to investigate reliability of uncontrollable schemes .",
    "a particularly convenient uncontrollable approach for the analysis of the hubbard model is hubbard - i approximation  @xcite .",
    "hubbard - i , being invalid for @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the number of the nearest neighbor sites on the lattice ) , could be considered as a good first approximation in the case of the strong correlations @xmath19 .",
    "its evident advantage is its simplicity .",
    "the method allows deriving analytical results in many cases or performing numerical calculations at low computational cost .",
    "the clarity and transparency of the hubbard - i approximation explains its popularity among the researchers working in the field of strongly correlated electronic systems . for us , it is especially important that , after the discovery of high - tc superconductors , the method has been applied to the superconductivity as well .",
    "namely , hubbard - i approximation is used for study of superconductivity in the hubbard or extended hubbard model @xcite , in the hubbard model with phonons @xcite , in the hubbard model with attractive interaction @xcite .",
    "a related approach , the two - pole approximation ( which , in some respects , is superior to hubbard - i approximation ) , and its generalization are applied to study possible superconductivity of the usual hubbard model @xcite and of the multi - band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "similar techniques are used in @xcite .",

    "it contains the hubbard - i approximation as a special case .      despite broad use of the hubbard - i approximation ,",
    "its ability to account for superconducting properties is untested . in this paper",
    "we address this issue by comparing the cooper pair propagator found with the help of generalized hubbard - i method against the same propagator calculated within the mc framework ( in this paper we refer to our calculations of the two - particle green s function as the _ generalized _ hubbard - i approximation to distinguish it from the classical hubbard - i scheme @xcite designed for evaluation of the single - particle green s function ) .",
    "such comparison has became possible only recently due to significant progress of computational techniques @xcite .",
    "we use the mc data of aimi and imada  @xcite , who analyze whether the hubbard model is enough to capture the phenomenon of high - tc superconductivity .",
    "these authors use an advanced numerical approach ( pre - projected gaussian - basis monte carlo ) .",
    "it evaluates the equal - time two - particle propagator in @xmath21-channel @xmath22 without any prior assumptions about the structure of the ground state wave function .",
    "the mc propagator on 10x10 square lattice does not exhibit superconducting correlations up to @xmath23 .",
    "instead , when @xmath2 grows , @xmath22 decays algebraically until finite size effects set in .    on our part ,",
    "we generalize the classic hubbard - i scheme @xcite and derive the equation of motion for the cooper pair propagator .",

    "it is shown that at large @xmath25 the results predicted by the hubbard - i approach are qualitatively consistent with numerical data obtained in ref .",
    "in particular , both approaches agree that the @xmath21-wave pairing correlations decay as @xmath1 ( `` free electron '' behaviour ) . the hubbard - i approximation underestimates coefficient @xmath3 by a factor of order three .",

    "the above decouplings correspond to the assumption that the propagation of a single electron is unaffected by the fluctuations of these quantities around their average values .",

    "the fact that the mc propagator decays as the free - electron propagator is a surprising revelation of ref .",
