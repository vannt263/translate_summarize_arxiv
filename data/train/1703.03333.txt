    "a nova eruption occurs when a white dwarf has accreted enough material from a companion star to trigger thermonuclear runaway on its surface ( e.g. , starrfield et al .",
    "observations with modern telescopes have revealed the presence of strong shocks in nova systems . in particular , the discovery of gev @xmath2-rays from v407 cyg indicated that in at least some systems , the shocks were strong enough to accelerate particles to very high energies ( abdo et al . 2010 ) . in the case of v407 cyg ,",
    "the shocks were the result of the nova ejecta colliding with a dense stellar wind from a mira variable companion ( abdo et al .",
    "much to the surprise of the nova community , further observations with the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ discovered @xmath2-ray emission from systems with main sequence companions ( e.g. , ackermann et al . 2014 ) .    while observations across the electromagnetic spectrum have contributed to the discovery of shocks in novae ,",
    "radio observations have proven to be particularly valuable . resolved radio images",
    "can reveal non - spherical structure and provide evidence for multiple outflows , as in the case of v959 mon ( chomiuk et al . 2014 ) .",
    "early monitoring of the radio emission , even when the ejecta are too small to resolve , has also prove to be an effective probe of shocks in novae .",
    "the shocks can manifest as synchrotron emission with non - thermal brightness temperatures in spectacular ways as in v1723 aql ( weston et al .",
    "2016a ) , or more subtle ways as in v5589 sgr ( weston et al .",
    "when the radio synchrotron emission is bright enough , the shocks can be directly imaged with very long baseline interferometry , as in v959 mon ( chomiuk et al . 2014 ) and rs oph ( rupen et al . 2008 ; sokoloski et al . 2008 ) .",
    "observations with modern x - ray telescopes have also proven to be useful in characterizing shocks in novae .",
    "those novae embedded within the wind of a giant companion typically emitting bright , hard x - rays early in their evolution , such as rs oph ( bode et al .",
    "2006 ; nelson et al . 2008 ) and v745 sco ( page et al . 2015 ; orio et al .",
    "novae in systems with main sequence companions are also capable of producing strong x - rays , but typically later in their evolution such was the case in both v382 vel ( mukai & ishida 2001 ) and v5589 sgr ( weston et al .",
    "2016b ) .",
    "on 2015 february 11 , the nova v1535 sco was discovered in the constellation scorpius .",
    "it was reported in vsnet - alert 18276 by p. schmeer and in cbet 4078 by t. kojina .",
    "early optical and near infrared follow - up indicated the nova was fading rapidly ( walter 2015 ) .",
    "the combination of rapid fading and a possible bright near - infrared counterpart indicated that the companion star could be an m giant , in which case the nova could be embedded in the wind from a giant companion ( walter 2015 ) .",
    "srivastava et al .",
    "( 2015 ) later argued that the companion could be a k giant based on pre - eruption 2mass photometry of a likely counterpart ( 2mass j17032617 - 3504178 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations indicated it was a he / n type nova ( walter 2015 ; srivastava et al .",
    "early x - ray and radio observations ( nelson et al . 2015 ) indicated the presence of strong shocks in the ejecta , which was further evidence that the ejecta were expanding into a dense medium .",
    "the nova was originally given the designation pnv j1703260 - 3504140 , then known as nova sco 2015 , and eventually given the official designation v1535 sco .",
    "srivastava et al .",
    "( 2015 ) also noted that narrowing of the h - line profiles in the infrared indicated the presence of a deceleration shock , and estimated the total mass ejected to be between @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 m@xmath6 ( where @xmath5 is the filling factor of the ejecta ) .    during the 2015 outburst , no _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "staring mode observations were scheduled and the nova was not reported as a detection from the survey mode data . however , it must be noted that _",
    "fermi _ is generally less sensitive to transients at the galactic center due to a combination of the high background , and the north - south `` rocking '' profile of the survey mode results in the galactic center having minimal exposure ( acero et al .",
    "it is therefore possible that v1535 sco produced @xmath2-rays like other novae ( e.g. , v407 cyg and v745 sco ; abdo et al .",
    "2010 ; cheung et al .",
    "2014 ) , but none were detectable due to these limiting factors .",
    "recent work by morris et al .",
    "( 2017 ) argues that all novae produce @xmath2-ray emission , but we mainly detect the nearby ones with _ fermi_.    in this paper , we present our multi - wavelength observations of v1535 sco made during 2015 . these observations were made with the karl j. jansky very large array ( vla ) , the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , and the small & moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) .",
    "we present our observations and data reduction methods in section 2 .",
    "our knowledge about the distance to v1535 sco is discussed in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we present results from the multi - wavelength observations .",
    "we discuss our findings in section 5 .",
    "final conclusions are summarized in section 6 . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the initial optical detection of the nova on 2015 february 11.837 ( mjd 57064.837 ) as day 0.0 .",
    "we also use the term `` embedded nova '' to refer to any nova embedded in the wind material from its companion star ( e.g. chomiuk et al . 2012 ; mukai et al .",
    "we began monitoring v1535 sco with the vla within 64 hours of its discovery in the optical .",
    "the first epoch only included observations at c - band ( 4.0 - 8.0 ghz ) and ka - band ( 26.5 - 40.0 ghz ) .",
    "all following epochs also included observations at l - band ( 1.0 - 2.0 ghz ) and ku - band ( 12.0 - 18.0 ghz ) .",
    "to maximize spectral coverage , all bands were split into upper and lower sidebands . for the first 8 epochs",
    ", we used 8-bit sampling for all frequencies .",
    "this gave us a total bandwidth of 1.0 ghz at l - band , and 2.0 ghz at all other bands .",
    "for the ninth epoch ( day 93.463 ) we used 3-bit sampling for ku - band and ka - band , resulting in total bandwidths of 6.0 ghz and 8.0 ghz , respectively .",
    "for the final epoch ( day 122.363 ) , we used 3-bit sampling for c - band , ku - band , and ka - band , giving total bandwidths of 4.0 ghz , 6.0 ghz , and 8.0 ghz , respectively .",
    "10 epochs were observed under the program vla/13b-057 , and one epoch ( day 93.463 ) was observed under the program s61420 .",
    "the nova was detected during the first epoch ( day 2.7 ) and remained detectable at multiple frequencies for nearly 100 days .",
    "we ceased observations once the nova had faded to the point where it was no longer detected at all frequencies .",

    "there are two possible explanations for this second episode of synchrotron emission .",
    "first , the ejecta encountered another dense medium to shock against . using the fit to the velocity from h@xmath17 emission lines and integrating over time",
    ", the h@xmath17 emitting region had a radius of approximately 13 au by this time .",
    "if we assume that the ejecta that were emitting synchrotron radiation at this time was instead travelling at a velocity of 1659 km s@xmath21 for 49 days , that would be at a radius of approximately 47 au .",
    "if we assume that the synchrotron - emitting material was from the ejecta producing the high velocity outliers in the h@xmath17 spectra and travelled with a constant velocity of 4782 km @xmath21 , it would have travelled 135 au by day 49 .",
    "it is possible that the ejecta caught up to material ejected during a previous nova eruption .",
    "if we assume that the slowest material from a previous ejecta were moving at 50 km @xmath21 , the previous eruption would have occurred 1.2 years ago for a distance of 13 au , 4.5 years ago for a distance of 47 au , or 12.8 years ago for a distance of 137 au .",
    "of these three , the 12.8 years seems the most likely , as it is hard to imagine the astronomy community could have missed multiple outbursts of this nova in the past 10 years .",
    "however , a recurrence time of 12.8 years would still require that this system is a very young recurrent nova undergoing only its second or third outburst , or that we have missed a very large number of its previous eruptions .",
    "the second possibility is that the second synchrotron event is the result of shocks within the ejecta itself .",
    "we already have evidence for two different outflows from the width of the h@xmath17 line and the high velocity outliers ( see section 2.4 ) .",
    "it is not hard to imagine an interaction between these two outflows , or possibly even a third outflow such as a hot , fast wind driven by thermonuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf but hidden below the optical photosphere of the bulk of the ejecta .          using the radial size",
    ", we can estimate what we expect the brightness temperature of the ejecta to be at the time of the vlba observation using @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the radius of the spherically expanding ejecta and @xmath118 is the distance to the source ( e.g. , seaquist & bode 2008 ) .",
    "we will start by assuming the size of the radio emitting region is the same as the h@xmath17 emitting region . from our fit to the h@xmath17 line widths presented in section 2.4 , we derive a radius for the h@xmath17 emitting region of @xmath119 cm on day 7.663 . using only the vlba flux of 0.477 mjy , and assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc",

    "this material would have a @xmath122 k. both of these are significantly higher than the estimate of @xmath123 k using the distance - free formula for @xmath63 in section 4.2 . to get the largest possible radius",
    ", we could assume the ejecta were travelling at 4782 km s@xmath21 for 7.663 days , giving a radius of @xmath124 cm and @xmath125 k. the discrepancy between the observational and expected @xmath63 can indicate several possibilities : first , the ejecta were unresolved by the vlba ; second , the nova is much closer than 8.5 kpc ; third , the ejecta shape is highly non - spherical ; or some combination of these reasons .",
    "we should note that the expected @xmath63 using the largest possible radius agrees well with the observational @xmath63 assuming 2 point sources .",
    "however , using the largest possible radius would only give us a single sphere with an angular size of 2.5 mas at 8.5 kpc ( which just happens to be the minor axis of the vlba restoring beam for our observation ) , not the 2 point sources modelled in section 4.2 , so we can not reconcile the measurement with the observation quite so easily .    from section 3 ,",
    "recall that the closest the nova can be is 5.8 kpc . at this distance",
    ", the brightness temperature would be @xmath126 k for a radius of @xmath119 cm , @xmath127 k for a radius of @xmath121 cm , or @xmath128 k for a radius of @xmath124 cm .",
    "the first two are still larger than our value of @xmath129 k we calculated for the single - component model in section 4.2 , although they are comparable to the two - component model .",
    "the final one , using our maximum possible radius , agrees well with the single - component model @xmath63 in section 4.2 .",
    "however , recall that we find it more likely that the high velocity outliers in the h@xmath17 spectra represent a bipolar outflow , not an expanding spherical shell .    note that this approach to estimating what the brightness temperature should be at the time of the vlba detection assumes that the entire surface of the ejecta shell is emitting .",
    "if the emission is coming from compact , jet - like structures as in rs oph ( rupen et al .",
    "2008 ; sokoloski et al .",
    "2008 ) , the value for @xmath117 would be smaller and the estimate for @xmath63 would be even larger . placing",
    "the nova at further distances also increases the estimate for @xmath63 .    because placing the nova closer does not make the values of @xmath63 match",
    ", it is more likely that the vlba did not fully resolve the compact emitting region on day 7.663 . because of the highly - elliptical shape of the restoring beam , it is especially likely that there is unresolved structure in the north - south direction .",
    "however , the image does look like there is some resolved structure in the east - west direction .",
    "we find it likely that the compact component is non - spherical , possibly bi - lobed , with more extension in the east - west direction .",
    "we used the emission measures for both radio and x - ray to investigate whether the secondary maximum in the radio light curve that occurs between day 23.663 and 26.563 can be explained by thermal radio emission from the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "for the x - rays , the emission measure depends on the volume of the emitting region : @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the number densities of ions and electrons , respectively , and @xmath133 is the volume of emitting material . generally it is assumed that @xmath134 so that it simplifies to @xmath135 . to make a further simplification ,",
    "the emitting volume is assumed to be thin compared to the total extent of the ejecta so that it can be approximated as a uniform slab : @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the radius of the ejecta ( we are assuming the emitting region can be approximated as a cylinder ) and @xmath138 is the thickness of the emitting region . the x - ray emission measure can be determined from the hot plasma parameters in the fits to the _ swift _ data : @xmath139 where @xmath118 is the distance to the nova . assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc ( placing the nova approximately at the galactic center ) and using @xmath140 from day 24.75 ( see table  [ swiftab2 ] )",
    "gives @xmath141 @xmath142 .",
    "assuming the ejecta travel with a constant velocity of 1659 km s@xmath21 , we can determine the approximate radius for the shell on day 24.75 was @xmath143 cm .",
    "if we assume that the thickness of the emitting shell is @xmath71 of its radius , we can solve for the number density of the emitting electrons : @xmath144 @xmath142 emitting at a temperature of approximately @xmath145 k ( from kt@xmath146 in table  [ swiftab2 ] ) .",
    "note that if we assume a larger distance to the nova , both @xmath147 and @xmath132 increase .",
    "the radio ( path length ) emission measure is given by : @xmath148 plugging in the same @xmath138 ( but this time in pc ) used for @xmath147 and using @xmath132 derived from the x - ray data gives @xmath149 @xmath150 pc .",
    "the radio emission measure is also part of the equation for optical depth , @xmath151 ( rohlfs & wilson 2006 ) : @xmath152 therefore , another way to calculate the radio emission measure is given by : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the electron temperature in k , @xmath53 is the observing frequency in ghz , @xmath151 is the optical depth at the observing frequency , and @xmath155 is a correction term usually assumed to be 1 . in order for the emission to be optically thick at the observed frequency , @xmath156 .",
    "because we are trying to determine if the radio flux can be explained by the x - ray plasma , we set @xmath157 k from the kt@xmath146 value from the fits to the swift data on day 24.75 ( see table  [ swiftab2 ] ) .",
    "we use our highest observing frequency of 36.5 ghz because it provides the tightest constraint .",
    "this gives us @xmath158 @xmath150 pc , which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than expected from the x - ray electron number density used above .",
    "therefore , under the reasonable assumptions we have made , the x - ray emitting plasma can not account for the thermal radio emission detected around day 24 .",
    "it is more likely that there is also a warm ( @xmath159k ) ionized ejecta that begins to dominate the radio emission at this time .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty on @xmath140 from day 24.75 is very high .",
    "if we use the @xmath140 value from day 17.93 with its much lower uncertainty and assume that the number density remains mostly constant until day 24 , we get @xmath160 @xmath142 , which would imply @xmath161 @xmath150 pc .",
    "this makes the discrepancy between the two methods for determining the radio emission measure even greater , further strengthening our argument that the x - ray emitting plasma can not account for the radio flux density observed during the second radio maximum .",
    "v1535 sco showed peculiar behavior at nearly every wavelength we observed .",
    "the radio emission started bright , faded quickly , and then had two re - brightening events .",
    "the spectral index for early radio emission and the second radio re - brightening event were consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "the x - ray emission began promptly with a hard spectrum .",
    "there was a re - brightening in the x - rays which appeared to correspond to the second re - brightening event in the radio .",
    "the lack of connection between the first radio re - brightening event and the x - ray emission implies that are are at least two emitting components in the ejecta : one shock - heated plasma and one thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the optical observations indicate that the nova was discovered post - peak , and faded very fast .",
    "optical spectroscopy also indicated the presence of two outflows : 1 ) a relatively slow ( @xmath01659 km s@xmath21 ) outflow ; and 2 ) a fast ( @xmath04782 km s@xmath21 ) , possibly bipolar outflow .",
    "spectral monitoring of the h@xmath17 line at late times also indicated the presence of a neutral , dense surrounding cloud of emitting material .",
    "the early hard x - rays combined with the radio synchrotron emission and the detection with the vlba strongly support the existence of strong shocks very early in the evolution of the nova .",
    "such early strong shocks are most easily explained by the presence of a dense wind from the companion star .",
    "the estimated magnetic field from the vlba detection was between 0.10 g and 0.18 g , which is larger than but comparable to the magnetic field strength found by rupen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for rs oph , a system known to have a red giant companion .",

    "the radio spectral index at this time changed from being consistent with optically thick thermal bremsstrahlung , to being synchrotron - like .",
    "the x - ray emission also showed an increase at this time .",
    "we posit that this second shock was the result of collisions between multiple outflows within the ejecta , but the presence of a shell of dense material ( possibly from a previous eruption ) has not been completely ruled out .",

    "<S> we present multi - wavelength observations of the unusual nova v1535 sco throughout its outburst in 2015 . </S>",
    "<S> early radio observations were consistent with synchrotron emission , and early x - ray observations revealed the presence of high - energy ( > 1 kev ) photons . </S>",
    "<S> these indicated that strong shocks were present during the first @xmath02 weeks of the nova s evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the radio spectral energy distribution was consistent with thermal emission from week 2 to week 6 . </S>",
    "<S> starting in week 7 , the radio emission again showed evidence of synchrotron emission and there was an increase in x - ray emission , indicating a second shock event . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectra show evidence for at least two separate outflows , with the faster outflow possibly having a bipolar morphology . </S>",
    "<S> the optical and near infrared light curves and the x - ray n@xmath1 measurements indicated that the companion star is likely a k giant . </S>"
