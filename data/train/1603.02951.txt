    "the correlation femtoscopy method ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) ) uses momentum correlations of identical particles to extract information about the spatiotemporal structure of extremely small and short - lived systems created in nucleon and nuclear collisions .",
    "the method is grounded in the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac symmetric properties of the quantum states . because in high - energy nucleus - nucleus or hadron - hadron collisions most of produced particles are pions , the bose - einstein correlations of two identical pions are usually analyzed to increase the statistics of the correlation femtoscopy measurements .",
    "inasmuch as mean particle multiplicities increase with collision energy , one can divide a whole set of high energy collision events into subsets with fixed charged - particle multiplicities . in recent papers",
    "@xcite it was considered even a possibility of single - event correlation femtoscopy  at least , theoretically , because in reality not enough pairs remain for a statistically meaningful analysis in a single event . typically , the ensemble of events with charged - particle numbers selected in some fixed multiplicity bins is analyzed . in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the measurement of observables as a function of the multiplicity class has a long history and is regarded as a proxy for centrality dependence .",
    "recently , due to the start of large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments where colliding energies per nucleon pair are in a tev region , the fixed particle multiplicity technique has also been utilized for analysis of the bose - einstein correlations of identical particles in proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "it is firmly established now that high - energy heavy - ion collisions are described basically by relativistic hydrodynamics ( for recent reviews , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and that at the later dilute stage of matter evolution the hydrodynamics is followed by the highly dissipative hadronic gas expansion that is modeled by a hadronic cascade model like urqmd @xcite till the free streaming regime is reached .",
    "the so - called particlization  transition from continuous medium ( hydrodynamic ) consideration of the system to its particle - based description  is associated typically with the lowest possible temperature when the system is still close to local thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "it defines the isotherm that is often called the chemical freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "the situation is less clear in high - multiplicity proton - proton collisions , and there are also attempts to describe particle momentum spectra in such collisions using a hydrodynamic approach ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is worth to noting that quantum statistics is not an inherent property of these , as well as many other , quasiclassical models .",
    "typically , when hadrons are generated on the particlization hypersurface , the single particle weight is sampled according to the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distributions in the grand canonical ensemble ( with viscous corrections , if necessary ) in the framework of the so - called cooper - frye prescription @xcite . as for the two - identical - particle spectra ,",
    "the current quasiclassical simulations utilize the factorized decomposition of the two - particle emission function into the single - particle ones with the additional multiplier proportional to the module squared of two - particle symmetrized or antisymmetrized amplitudes , so that the correlation function becomes ( omitting all nonprincipal details ) @xmath2 , where angular brackets mean averaging over an emission function .",
    "such a local `` switching on '' of the quantum statistic effects in two - particle cross sections is just like in the final - state - interaction method .",
    "however , the quantum statistics is not associated with local two - particle interaction but is the global effect , and complete symmetrization or antisymmetrization of the _ total _ system is required to find the correct results for one- and multi- particle momentum spectra .",
    "such an analysis was done in refs .",
    "it has been shown that for thermal identical particles the above mentioned procedure for one- and two - boson spectra evaluations in quasiclassical models is correct if one provides the symmetrization in an _ ensemble _ of initially independently emitted thermal boltzmann particles with the poisson distribution for the particle numbers in the ensemble .",
    "otherwise , the above - described prescription for the simulation of the single- and double - particle spectra and the correlation function @xmath3 is not correct . in particular , it is violated for the states with a fixed boson number .",
    "the detailed grounding of such a conclusion , provided in ref .",
    "@xcite with corresponding numerical calculations , is based on the nonrelativistic kopylov - podgoretsky model @xcite of initially boltzmann independent factorized sources ( with subsequent symmetrization ) .    in this article",
    "we use as a basis thermal canonical and grand - canonical bosonic ensembles for quantum relativistic ideal gases , which allows us to avoid the specific procedure of `` switching on '' the quantum statistics as well as the assumption of initially distinguishable sources .",
    "our aim is to clarify the general reasons of violation of the standard prescriptions for @xmath3 ( see above ) when one calculates the correlation function in events with fixed multiplicity or just on an event - by - event basis @xcite .",
    "the answer is not trivial and depends on the applicability of the thermal wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this study to give a comprehensive analysis and prescription for quasiclassical event generators dealing with @xmath1 and @xmath0 collisions .",
    "rather , the purpose of this paper is to show how imposed particle number constraints affect the single - particle momentum density and the two - particle momentum correlation function in a canonical ensemble of a finite system , as well as to present the analytical estimates for these values in some tractable approximations . in particular , the conditions under which the standard decomposition of two - particle distribution can be applied are considered .",

    "the third result is based on our approximation ( [ 40 ] ) of the correlation function of a finite system without any modification .",
    "one can see that the last result qualitatively reproduces the previous one where the one - particle spectra are calculated from the two - particle ones in a direct way ( that is , in fact , an exact self - consistent approach ) and the two - particle spectra are taken in our finite - system approximation ( numerator of eq .",
