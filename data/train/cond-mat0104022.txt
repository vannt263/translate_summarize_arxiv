    "the effect of a topological constraint should be nontrivial on physical quantities of a ring polymer such as the size of the ring polymer .",
    "once a ring polymer is formed , its topological state , which is given by a knot , is fixed .",
    "however , it has not been established how to formulate the topological constraint on the ring polymer in terms of analytic methods . on the other hand ,",
    "several numerical simulations have been performed , investigating some statistical properties of ring polymers under topological constraints @xcite . through the simulations , it has been found that a topological constraint may severely restrict the available degrees of freedom in the configuration space of a ring polymer , and can be significant in its physical properties .",
    "recently , dna knots are synthesized in experiments , and then separated into various knot types by the agarose - gel - electrophoresis technique @xcite . under the electric field ,",
    "the charged macromolecules move through the network of the gel , and the migration rates should depend on their sizes , shapes and charges .",
    "it is remarkable that the electrophoretic mobility of a circular dna depends also on its knot type .",
    "it is observed that the more complicated the dna knot is , the higher its mobility .",
    "the fact could be related to a common belief that the gyration radius of a knotted dna should depend on its knot type .    in this paper , we discuss the mean square radius of gyration of circular polymers having a fixed knot type .",
    "we consider the question how the size of a ring polymer should depend on the length @xmath0 under the topological constraint . here",
    "the length @xmath0 corresponds to the number of polygonal nodes , when we model the ring polymers by some self - avoiding polygons .",
    "we find that the effect of the topological constraint is not trivial .",
    "in fact , the mean square radius of gyration for ring polymers under the topological constraint can be smaller or larger than that of the ring polymers under no topological constraint , as we shall see later .",
    "we study the question through numerical simulations , making use of some knot invariants .",
    "we construct an ensemble of ring polymers consisting of freely jointed hard cylinders , and then evaluate the mean square radius of the gyration for the ring polymers that have the given knot type .",
    "let us explain the model of ring polymers consisting of freely jointed hard cylinders @xcite .",
    "the segments are given by hard cylinders with radius @xmath1 .",
    "they are `` hard '' in the sense that there is no overlap allowed between any pair of non - adjacent cylindrical segments , while adjacent segments can overlap : there is no constraint on any pair of adjacent cylinders .",
    "the model was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite with the monte - carlo algorithm using the `` hedgehog '' configurations of polygons .",
    "recently , another method was introduced for constructing the cylindrical self - avoiding polygons @xcite .",
    "it is based on the algorithm of ring - dimerization @xcite for the rod - bead model of self - avoiding polygons .",
    "we call the new algorithm the cylindrical ring - dimerization method , or the dimerization method , for short .",
    "all the cylindrical self - avoiding polygons in this paper are constructed by the dimerizaion method .",
    "we note that the algorithm of chain dimerization is quite effective for constructing long self - avoiding walks on off - lattice @xcite .",
    "the most useful property of the model of cylindrical self - avoiding polygons is that it has the two parameters : the cylinder radius @xmath1 and the number @xmath0 of segments .",
    "the two parameters are important in the theoretical explanation of the experimental data of dna knots @xcite : the cylinder radius corresponds to the effective radius of negatively charged dnas surrounded by the clouds of counter ions .",
    "thus , the model is closely related to the wormlike chain model for polyelectrolytes in electrolyte solutions .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the cylinder radius @xmath1 plays an important role in the random knotting probability @xcite .",
    "now let us consider the mean square radius of gyration @xmath2 for the cylindrical self - avoiding polygons .",
    "it is defined by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the position vector of the @xmath5-th monomer and @xmath0 is the number of nodes in the cylindrical self - avoiding polygon . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the statistical average @xmath6 is given by the average over @xmath7 samples of polygons .",
    "we take @xmath8 in the paper : we construct @xmath9 self - avoiding polygons of @xmath0 segments of cylinders with radius @xmath1 by the dimerization method .",
    "we have calculated numerical estimates of the the mean square radius of gyration @xmath10 for the cylindrical self - avoiding polygons with the different values of radius @xmath1 for several different numbers @xmath0 of polygonal nodes upto 1000 .",
    "we consider eighteen numbers from 20 to 1000 for the number @xmath0 of polygonal nodes , and fifteen different values from 0.0 to 0.07 for the cylinder radius @xmath1 . here",
    "we note that the gyration radii for the rod - bead polygons have been estimated in refs .",
    "let us describe the method for selecting such polygons that have a given knot type in our simulation . for a given knot @xmath11 , we enumerate the number @xmath12 of such polygons out of the @xmath7 polygons that have the same set of values of some knot invariants for the knot type @xmath11 .",
    "we employ two knot invariants , the determinant @xmath13 of knot and the vassiliev - type invariant @xmath14 of the second degree , as the tool for detecting the knot type of a given polygon @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath12 depends not only on the knot type but also on the step number @xmath0 and cylinder radius @xmath1 .",
    "let us recall the knotting probability for cylindrical self - avoiding polygons consisting of cylinders with the radius @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the probability of a cylindrical self - avoiding polygon of @xmath0 nodes with cylinder radius @xmath1 being a trivial knot .",
    "then , it is given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is called the characteristic length of random knotting and can be approximated by an exponential function of @xmath1 : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a constant @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the mean square radius of gyration for cylindrical self - avoiding polygons with a fixed knot type .",
    "we evaluate the expected value of the gyration radius for a given knot @xmath11 by the mean value of the square radii of gyration for the @xmath12 polygons with the knot @xmath11 .",
    "then , the mean square radius of gyration @xmath20 for the knot type @xmath11 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the gyration radius of the @xmath23-th cylindrical self - avoiding polygon that has the knot type @xmath11 , in the set of @xmath7 polygons .",
    "for the rod - bead model of self - avoiding polygons , @xmath20 has been evaluated for some different knots @xcite .",
    "let us discuss our data of numerical estimates of @xmath20 .",
    "for trivial , trefoil and figure - eight knots , we find that the mean square radius of gyration increases monotonically with respect to the number @xmath0 of polygonal nodes . however , the ratio @xmath24 is not constant with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "the graphs of the ratio @xmath24 against the step number @xmath0 are plotted in fig . 1 for trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "here the cylinder radius is given by 0.005 , i.e. , the diameter is given by 0.01 .",
    "here we recall that @xmath2 denotes the mean square radius of gyration for the self - avoiding polygons with all possible knot types . in terms of @xmath20 , @xmath2",
    "is given by the following : @xmath25 .",
    "we recall that the number @xmath12 gives different values for different step numbers @xmath0 or different knots @xmath11 .",
    "when the knot @xmath11 is complicated , @xmath12 can be very small and it may give a poor statistics to @xmath20 .",
    "let us discuss the plots of the trivial knot shown in fig .",
    "1 . the ratio @xmath26 at @xmath27 is almost given by 1.0 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that trivial knots are dominant when @xmath0 is small .",
    "here we recall that the probability of being a trivial knot is given by eq .",
    "( [ pro ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath26 increases with respect to the step number @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the size of the ring polymer enlarges under the topological constraint of being a trivial knot .",
    "the topological constraint gives an effective swelling effect , in this case .",
    "let us consider the case of trefoil knot .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 is not always larger than 1.0 .",
    "in fact , it is smaller than 1.0 when @xmath29 .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 is given by about 0.7 when @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the topological constraint gives an effective shrinking effect on the ring polymer .",
    "when @xmath30 300 or 400 , the ratio @xmath28 becomes larger than 1.0 for @xmath31 0.005 .",
    "thus , the topological constraint makes the ring polymer enlarge for large @xmath0 .",
    "however , when @xmath32 , the ratio @xmath28 becomes smaller than 1.0 even for @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 .    in figs . 1 and 2",
    ", we see that the difference among the ratios of the gyration radii for trivial , trefoil and figure - eight knots is much more clear in the small-@xmath0 region than in the large-@xmath0 region",
    ". the dependence of the gyration radius of the ring polymer on its knot type could be more significant for small @xmath0 than for large @xmath0 .",
    "the effective shrinking of a thick and finite ring - polymer with a nontrivial knot might be associated with the concept of ideal knots or tight knots @xcite .    the fitting curves in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are given by @xmath34 here , the constants @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are fitting parameters .",
    "we see that the fitting curves in figs . 1 and 2 are consistent with all the numerical estimates of @xmath20 in the range from @xmath27 to 1000 .",
    "thus , the formula ( [ formula ] ) effectively describes the finite - size behaviour of @xmath20 , although there is no apriori reason for assuming it .",
    "for instance , the formula ( [ formula ] ) can be not appropriate as an asymptotic expansion . in  6",
    ", we shall introduce another formula to discuss the possible asymptotic behaviors of @xmath20 .",
    "let us discuss possible asymptotic behaviors of the gyration radius of the ring polymer under a topological constraint .",
    "we may assume that when @xmath0 is very large , @xmath20 can be approximated by @xmath38 the expansion is consistent with renormalization group arguments , and hence it should be valid for the case of asymptotically large @xmath0 .",
    "the exponent @xmath39 and the amplitude @xmath40 can be evaluated by applying the formula ( [ asymp ] ) to the numerical data of @xmath20 for large values of @xmath0 . here we note that the expansion ( [ asymp ] ) is not effective for small @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath41 , it does not give any good fitting curves to the data in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "let us now discuss the exponent @xmath39 .",
    "we have analyzed the plots of @xmath42 given in fig . 1 for trivial and trefoil knots by the least - sqaure method with respect to the following formula : @xmath43 .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath44 , which is consistent with the scaling expansion .",
    "then , we obtain the following estimates : for trivial knot , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ; for trefoil knot , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "to each of the knots , we have applied the formula ( [ asymp ] ) to the eight points with @xmath51 in fig .",
    "the @xmath52 values are given by 4.3 and 6.2 for trivial and trefoil knots , respectively .",
    "for other values of radius @xmath1 , we have similar results .",
    "thus , for trivial and trefoil knots , the exponent @xmath39 should agree with the exponent @xmath53 of the mean square radius of gyration @xmath2 , within the error bars .",
    "there are also other evidences supporting @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 , for trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "in fact , the plots of the ratio @xmath56 versus the number @xmath0 in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are likely to approach some horizontal lines at some large @xmath0 .",
    "it is also the case with some other values of cylinder radius @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear particularly for trivial knot .",
    "thus , at least for trivial knot , we can easily conclude that the exponent @xmath39 should coincide with the exponent @xmath53 .",
    "we note that even the fitting formula ( [ formula ] ) is consistent with the coincidence of the exponents : @xmath54 .",
    "thus , all the numerical results obtained in the paper suggest @xmath54 for trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "it is also consistent with the observation for the self - avoiding polygon on a lattice in refs .",
    "@xcite that the exponent @xmath39 should be independent of the knot type .",
    "let us now consider the amplitude @xmath40 of the asymptotic expansion ( [ asymp ] ) . in fig .",
    "3 , the numerical plots of the ratio @xmath57 versus the radius @xmath1 are shown for trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "the ratio is evaluated by the following formula : @xmath58 here , we have assumed @xmath59 and @xmath60=0.5 .",
    "furtheremore , we have applied it only to the data with @xmath51 .    when @xmath1 is small , the ratio @xmath57 in fig . 3 is larger than 1.0 for both trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "it is remarkable that the asymptotic ratio @xmath57 can be larger than 1.0 when the ring polymer is thin enough .",
    "we can easily confirm it also in fig .",
    "1 , observing the increasing behavior of the plots of @xmath26 versus @xmath0 . thus , the topological constraint gives an effective expansion to the ring polymer with small radius @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , we see in fig .",
    "3 that the ratio @xmath57 decreases monotonically with respect to the cylinder radius @xmath1 . one might expect that the ring polymer with larger excluded - volume should become much larger . in reality , however , for the ring polymer under the topological constraint , the ratio @xmath57 decreases if the excluded - volume parameter becomes large .",
    "it is as if the excluded volume effect could make weaken the effective expansion derived from the topological constraint .",
    "we notice in fig .",
    "3 that @xmath57 might become close to the value 1.0 when @xmath1 is thick enough . due to the poor statistics",
    ", we can not determine whether it really does or not .",
    "however , if it does , then it is consistent with the interpretation on the lattice model of refs .",
    "@xcite that @xmath40 should be independent of knot type .",
    "it is quite nontrivial that @xmath57 which is valid in the asymptotic expansion can be larger than 1.0 , and the ratio decreases with respect to the radius @xmath1 .",
    "let us give one possible explanation for it .",
    "first , we note that @xmath2 is given by the average of @xmath20 over all possible knots : @xmath61 .",
    "the fact : @xmath62 suggests that there are large number of knots smaller than the knot @xmath11 .",
    "second , we recall the finite-@xmath0 behavior of @xmath63 : in figs .",
    "1 and 2 we see that the ratio @xmath64 is much smaller than 1.0 when @xmath0 is small , while it increases with respect to @xmath0 and finally becomes constant .",
    "we consider that when @xmath0 is small , the size of trefoil knot is small due to a finite - size effect , while when @xmath0 is asymptotically large then @xmath64 becomes almost constant . for a given knot @xmath65 ,",
    "if we take @xmath0 large enough , then the ratio @xmath66 becomes constant with respect to @xmath0 , while the majority of knots possible in @xmath0-noded polygons should be much more complex than the knot @xmath65 and their sizes should be much smaller than that of the knot @xmath65 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 can be smaller than @xmath67 and the ratio @xmath68 can be larger than the value 1.0 .",
    "we remark that @xmath26 is always larger than 1.0 both for finite @xmath0 and asymptotically large @xmath0 . for the finite-@xmath0 case ,",
    "it is clear from figs . 1 and 2 that @xmath69 .",
    "for the asmptotic case , it is suggested from fig .",
    "3 that @xmath70 should be larger than 1.0 for some small values of radius @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the property : @xmath71 should persist in the asymptotic limit , as far as the data analysis is concerned .    summarizing the numerical results on the asymptotic behaviors ,",
    "we conclude that the topological constraint on a ring polymer gives an effective expansion when the radius @xmath1 is small and also that the expanding effect becomes weaker when the radius @xmath1 becomes larger , and it may vanish when the radius @xmath1 is large enough .",
    "the results suggest that there should be a new ` phase transition ' , where it is controlled by the excluded - volume parameter whether the topological constraint gives an effective expansion to the ring polymer or not .",
