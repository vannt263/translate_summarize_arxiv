    "<S> three - nucleon forces have been considered to be one possibility to resolve the well known discrepancy between experimental values and theoretical calculations of the nucleon analyzing power in low energy nucleon - deuteron scattering . in this paper , we investigate possible effects of two - pion exchange three - nucleon forces on the analyzing power and the differential cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the reason for different effects on the analyzing power by different three - nucleon forces found in previous calculations is related to the existence of the contact term . </S>",
    "<S> effects of some variations of two - pion exchange three - nucleon forces are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> also , an expression for the measure of the nucleon analyzing power with quartet p - wave phase shifts is presented .    </S>",
    "<S> differential cross sections for nucleon - deuteron elastic scattering have peaks at forward and backward scattering angles and a minimum at a c.m . </S>",
    "<S> scattering angle of , e.g. , @xmath0 at @xmath1 = 3 mev . around the cross section minimum angle , </S>",
    "<S> some observables calculated with realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials are known to deviate systematically from experimental values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon analyzing power @xmath2 for energies below @xmath3 30 mev has exhibited a notable discrepancy @xcite , which is referred to as the @xmath2 puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , in the neutron - deuteron ( n - d ) elastic scattering at @xmath4 = 3 mev , experimental @xmath2 has a maximum value at @xmath0 @xcite , while theoretical calculations with modern realistic nn potentials @xcite undershoot the value by about 30 % . the three - nucleon ( 3n ) system has been considered as a good testing ground for the nn interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated @xmath2 may show that there is room for improvement of modern nn potentials . </S>",
    "<S> actually , it was pointed out that changes in @xmath5 nn forces or the spin - orbit component of a potential cause a dramatic increase in @xmath2 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however constraint from nn observables made it difficult to obtain reasonable changes in the nn potential to resolve the @xmath2 puzzle @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another possibility for resolving the @xmath2 puzzle is the introduction of a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) into the nuclear hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that most realistic nn forces underbind the triton , and a 3nf based on exchange of two pions among the three nucleons ( 2@xmath6e-3nf ) can explain the needed attraction . </S>",
    "<S> so far , several 2@xmath6e-3nf models have been proposed , among which the tucson - melbourne ( tm ) 3nf @xcite and the brazil ( the earlier version , br@xmath7 @xcite , and the latter version , br @xcite ) 3nf have been used for 3n calculations . although these 3nf models were made based on different ideas in constructing off - shell @xmath8 scattering amplitudes which are important ingredients in 2@xmath6e-3nf , the resulting potentials have essentially the same form with slightly different parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is reported that with introducing the tm-3nf or br-3nf , the calculated @xmath2 decreases , which means that the discrepancy with the experimental value is enhanced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the calculations with the br@xmath7 - 3nf or another 3nf model , the urbana ( ur ) 3nf , are reported to improve @xmath2 slightly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ur-3nf is based on the @xmath9-mediated two - pion exchange diagram @xcite , which is a part of diagrams included in tm-3nf and br-3nf . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy of the effects on @xmath2 should arise from a structure difference between tm / br-3nf and br@xmath7/ur-3nf . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study effects of the 2@xmath6e-3nf on @xmath2 carefully and investigate the possibility for resolving the @xmath2 puzzle with a 3nf . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations are performed at @xmath4 = 3 mev , where experimental data are available for the differential cross section @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite . the argonne @xmath10 model ( av18 </S>",
    "<S> ) @xcite is used as the input nn potential throughout this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> our method for calculating the 3n continuum state is based on a natural extension of the bound state calculation @xcite , in which the faddeev equation is expressed as an integral equation in coordinate space . in the continuum state calculation </S>",
    "<S> , there appear additional singularities in the faddeev integral kernel , which are absent in the bound state calculation : elastic singularity and three - body breakup singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the latter does not appear at energies below the three - body breakup threshold as in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> the former singularity can be easily treated by the usual subtraction method @xcite . in the present calculation , 3n partial wave states for which nn and 3n forces act , are restricted to those with total two - nucleon angular momenta @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the total 3n angular momenta ( @xmath12 ) is truncated at @xmath13 , while 3nf is switched off for 3n states with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> these truncating procedures are known to be valid for the low - energy ( @xmath4 = 3 mev ) n - d scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - pion exchange three nucleon potential has the following form in momentum space : @xmath15 , \\label{eq:2pie3np}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the momenta of the propagating pions , @xmath18 is the pion mass and @xmath19 a form factor which is parameterized as the dipole form with a cutoff mass @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , for the br@xmath7 - 3nf @xcite and the br-3nf @xcite are shown in table  [ tab:3np - param ] . since the brazil 3nf model is based on the effective lagrangian approach , in which several diagrams are considered explicitly , we can separate out the 3nf component which results from @xmath9-mediated diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters for this 3nf component , which should correspond to the ur-3nf , are shown in table  [ tab:3np - param ] as br@xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> .various parameters for the three - nucleon potentials , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2pie3np ] ) , used in the present work . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , we have studied the effects of the 2@xmath6e-3nf , and its variations , on some observables for n - d elastic scattering at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> we found that a contact term included in the 2@xmath6e-3nf gives a rather large @xmath2 effect . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why effects on @xmath2 by br / tm-3nf are different from those by br@xmath7/ur-3nf , which does not include the contact term . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 increases by about 5% with a 2@xmath6e-3nf model in which the contact term is eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> however , this increase is essentially the result of a decrease in the differential cross section caused by reproducing the triton binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the increase of @xmath2 by the modification of the @xmath5 nn force , which is caused by a variation in spin - dependent cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we found a phenomenological 3nf model which reproduces both of the triton binding energy and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this 3nf originates from @xmath8 @xmath26-wave scattering in the intermediate state with the strength parameter adjusted to reproduce the triton binding energy . but this 3nf destroys the good fit of the tensor analyzing power at the same time . since forces arising from the exchange of pions should have a tensor character , it seems natural that such forces affect not only the spin vector observables but also the spin tensor observables . </S>",
    "<S> a 3nf involving any mechanism other than 2@xmath6e , which might have a character of a spin - orbit forces as suggested from the modification of the @xmath5 nn force , should be examined to resolve the @xmath2 puzzle . </S>"
