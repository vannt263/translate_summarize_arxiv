    "kondo insulators are presently experiencing a renaissance since they are promising candidates for correlated materials with nontrivial topology@xcite .",
    "such predictions caused a flurry of experimental investigations on smb@xmath2 ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) and more recently we suggested that also ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 might be a good candidate for a strongly correlated material with topologically protected surface states@xcite .",
    "ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 is a tetragonal kondo insulator where the hybridization of @xmath4 and conduction electrons leads to the opening of a gap@xcite at low temperature .",
    "accordingly , the resistivity rises as temperature decreases , but saturates below @xmath5@xmath610k .",
    "our recent spectroscopic investigation of ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 showed that it has a large kondo temperature of about 170k and a @xmath7 ground state crystal - field symmetry ( @xmath8=@xmath91/2)@xcite which is the favorable symmetry for strong hybridization and opening of a gap according to dzero _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the opening of a gap in the presence of the @xmath8=1/2 symmetry is supported by our band structure calculations and we inferred that ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 must be topologically non trivial .    in that work@xcite we had deduced the kondo temperature from the temperature evolution of the @xmath10 spectral weight in the @xmath11-edge absorption data where we had detected the l@xmath12 emission line .",
    "a difficulty of the analysis of the @xmath13-edge data in general is the assignment of the spectral weights , even when measured in the life time reduced partial fluorescence yield mode , since the line shape reflects the empty 5@xmath14 density of states in the presence of the core hole .",
    "this uncertainty does not affect the temperature dependence but the absolute numbers for the spectral weights .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have been fitting empirical , identical line shapes to each @xmath15 configuration and found an absolute @xmath3 occupation of @xmath66% .",
    "hard x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( haxpes ) is a bulk sensitive technique@xcite and its data can be analyzed more quantitatively@xcite than that of x - ray absorption .    in cerium based kondo systems the electron in the @xmath4 shell hybridizes with the conduction electrons so that the resulting hybridized ground state is a mixed state that can be written as @xmath16=@xmath17 @xmath18+@xmath19@xmath20+@xmath21@xmath22 where the main component is given by the trivalent @xmath23 configuration with additional contributions of the divalent and tetravalent states ( @xmath24 and @xmath3 ) with weights @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 ( @xmath28=0,1,2 ) .",
    "@xmath30 denotes one ( two ) hole in the valence states . a core hole acts differently on the respective @xmath15 configurations so that they are split in a pes and xas experiment and the spectra exhibit three spectral weights that are related to the initial state @xmath15 admixtures .",
    "however , due to strong final state effects _ spectral _ weights and @xmath15 weights @xmath25 in the ground state are not related 1:1 . here a configuration interaction model is required for converting between the two .",
    "plasmons may complicate the situation when they cover up or distort the @xmath15 spectral weights . in such cases the spectra have to be corrected for plasmons by performing a full multiplet calculation that contains the plasmons as part of the lineshape ( see analysis ) .",
    "below we present haxpes data of ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 at t@xmath31 90k that have been analyzed quantitatively with the combination of a full multiplet and configuration interaction calculation .",

    "single crystals were grown by the self - flux floating - zone melting method using optical heating in a four - mirror furnace@xcite .",
    "the samples are single grain and single phase , as shown by laue and x - ray diffraction , scanning electron microscopy , and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "hard x - ray core level photoemission spectra are performed at the taiwan beamline bl12xu at the spring-8 synchrotron radiation facility in japan .",
    "the high incident energy of 6.47kev ensures bulk sensitivity .",
    "the photo electrons were detected by a mb scientific a-1he analyzer with a pass energy of 200mev in vertical geometry for the ce3@xmath14 test measurement and in horizontal geometry@xcite for the ce3@xmath0 and sn3@xmath0 , yielding an instrumental fwhm of about 1ev .",
    "the fermi energy was determined by a au thin film measured with same conditions .",
    "the samples were cooled down and cleaved in ultra high vacuum of @xmath610@xmath33 mbar and were then immediately transferred to the measurement position ( pressure @xmath343@xmath3510@xmath36 mbar and t@xmath3490k ) .",
    "the quality of the sample and sample surface was verified by performing long energy scans that verify the absence of extra peaks ( fermi energy to 1500ev binding energy ) .",
    "we have analyzed the haxpes data with a combination of full multiplet and configuration interaction model .",
    "we use the xtls  9.0 code@xcite for these calculations with input parameters from atomic calculations using cowans atomic code@xcite .",
    "the code uses a configuration interaction model based on a single non - dispersive valence state@xcite combined with a full multiplet calculation .",
    "the plasmon parameters are determined from emission lines that are not subject to the configuration interaction , here the sn3@xmath0 , so that , once the overall lineshape of the multiplet is adjusted , the configuration interaction model only depends on four parameters , coulomb exchange interaction between the @xmath4 electrons ( @xmath37 ) and between the @xmath4 electrons and core hole ( @xmath38 ) , the effective @xmath4-electron binding energy @xmath39@xmath40 and the isotropic hybridization @xmath41 .",
    "these parameters are uniquely defined by the intensity ratios and energy differences of the three valence states in the spectra .",
    "more details about the simulation can be found in ref.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "haxpes data of the sn3@xmath0 core level emission . data",
    "( black dots ) , shirley - type background ( black line ) , main emission lines ( orange line ) and fitted plasmon intensities ( green lines ) .",
    "the red line is the sum of the calculated contributions . ]    for the rare earth the 3@xmath14 core level spectrum is typically used for determining the valence state . in fig.[ce3d](top ) the ce3@xmath14 spectrum of ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 is shown .",
    "there are two sets of emission lines due to the 3@xmath14 spin - orbit splitting ( 3@xmath42 and 3@xmath43 ) .",
    "however , in ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 the sn3@xmath32 emission appears at 885ev binding energy ( see red arrow ) so that it severely distorts the spectral weights .",
    "we therefore measured the ce3@xmath0 emission line which is shown in fig.[ce3p](top ) .",
    "the advantage of the ce3@xmath0 is also that the two spin - orbit contributions do not overlap because the spin - orbit coupling of the ce3@xmath0 electrons is much stronger and the resulting splitting of the ce3@xmath44 and ce3@xmath45 much larger than for ce3@xmath14 ( note the different energy scales of fig.[ce3d ] and [ ce3p ] ) .",
    "a drawback is the stronger intrinsic lifetime broadening due to the higher binding energy .",
    "the expected averaged energy positions of the @xmath15 configurations are marked by the ruler at the bottom of fig.[ce3d ] and [ ce3p ] , respectively .    before analyzing the ce data",
    "further we look at the sn3@xmath0 emission lines which are also spin orbit split ( 3@xmath44 and 3@xmath45 ) ( see fig.[sn3p](top ) ) .",
    "the multiplet structure consists of a single emission line and sn is not affected by the configuration interaction so that the additional humps at about 16ev distance from the main emission lines are identified as strong plasmons .",
    "these plasmons have about the same energy distance from the main emission line as the expected @xmath3 contributions so that these plasmon intensities have to be taken into account when analyzing the ce3@xmath0 spectra . after subtracting a shirley - type background the plasmon parameters ( energy positions , intensity ratios , and widths of 1st , 2nd , and 3rd order plasmons )",
    "are determined form the sn3@xmath0 emission . in fig.[sn3p](top )",
    "the black line shows the shirley - type background and the green lines the plasmon contributions ( solid 1@xmath46 order , dashed 2@xmath47 order , and dotted 3@xmath48 order ) . the orange line is the multiplet line broadened with a gaussian fwhm=1ev and lorentzian fwhm=3.1ev as well as a mahan lineshape with energy cut - off @xmath49=8ev and asymmetry factor @xmath50=0.1 , and the red line is the total fit .",
    "the plasmon parameters are listed in table[tab_plasmon ] .",
    "we now use these plasmon parameters for describing the ce3@xmath0 multiplet structure i.e.  we attach the plasmon of this shape and energy to each emission line@xcite . in fig.[ce3p](top ) the shirley - type background ( black ) and resulting plasmon intensities ( green ) are shown . in the bottom part the background and plasmon corrected data are shown .",
    "there is clearly a strong shoulder at the energy position where we expect the @xmath3 spectral weight .",
    "the combination of multiplet and configuration interaction calculation yields the multiplet structure ( orange ) . for the fit",
    "the multiplet emission lines are broadened with a gaussian fwhm=1ev , a lorentzian fwhm=3.8ev and a mahan lineshape with energy cut - off @xmath49=8ev and asymmetry factor @xmath50=0.4 .",
    "the red line is the total fit .",
    "the resulting weights @xmath25 of the @xmath15 configurations in the initial state and the resulting configuration interaction parameters are listed in table[tab_results ] . the resulting @xmath3 weight ( @xmath51 ) to the ground state amounts to 8% .",
    "the strong lorentzian broadening and overlap between @xmath23 and @xmath24 limits the precise separation between theses contribution so that we give the sum of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . when fitting the main emphasis has been put on the ce3@xmath45 part of the data since it is not affected by the auger intensities .    as a consistency",
    "check the parameters from the ce3@xmath0 emission data were used for ce3@xmath14 .",
    "the black and green lines in fig.[ce3d](top ) refer to the shirley - type background and the plasmon intensities , using the parameters from table[tab_plasmon ] .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.[ce3d ] shows the background an plasmon corrected data ( 4 energy intervals grouped together ) , the multiplet structure ( orange ) resulting from the multiplet calculation with the configuration interactions parameters from table[tab_results ] and the calculated emission ( red line ) .",
    "the multiplet lines of the ce3@xmath14 are broadened with a gaussian fwhm=1ev , a lorentzian fwhm=1.6ev and a mahan lineshape with energy cut - off @xmath49=8ev and asymmetry factor @xmath50=0.3 .",
    "the ce3@xmath42 part is quite well described while the ce3@xmath43 shows some discrepancy between calculation and data .",
    "the latter was expected because of the contribution of sn3@xmath32 .",
    "note , that the ce3@xmath42 is still affected by the plasmon of the sn3@xmath32 .",

    "the value is slightly larger than in our previous @xmath13-edge absorption study@xcite since in the present analysis final state effects have been taken into account . comparing results of the same type of analysis , we can state that hybridization and occupation of @xmath3 of ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 are only slightly larger than in ceru@xmath55si@xmath55 , a magnetically non - ordering , metallic heavy fermion compound .",
    "however , ground state symmetries , that also have an impact on the efficiency of hybridization are not taken into account in such a comparison .",
    "we summarize that the ce3@xmath0 core level is an alternative to the ce3@xmath14 for determining valencies with photoemission and the present work provides a more quantitative value for the absolute @xmath3 weight in the ground state of ceru@xmath1sn@xmath2 , thus confirming its moderate intermediate valency .",
