    "the problem of the emergence of irreversible quantum dynamics from closed - system , unitary dynamics has occupied the attention of many researchers since the birth of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that an acceptable solution is to view every quantum system as coupled to an environment , i.e. , true quantum systems are always `` open '' .",
    "the action of the environment is to perform measurements on the system , thus establishing a preferred `` pointer basis '' and leading to decoherence @xcite . within a hamiltonian framework ,",
    "recipes for deriving the associated reduced - dynamics were known since the early nineteen - sixties , starting with the zwanzig projection technique : one writes down the heisenberg equation of motion for the combined system - environment state , and then projects out the system by tracing out the environment degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this yields an integro - differential equation involving an environment memory kernel , which must be subjected to approximations in order to become useful .",
    "the two main techniques available are the derivation of master equations by the use of the born - markov approximation @xcite , or a representation in terms of path integrals and influence functionals @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the former approach it is often unclear whether or not _",
    "complete positivity _ is preserved in the sequence of approximations one makes @xcite , while in the latter approach one must make a semi - classical approximation in order to obtain a tractable theory @xcite .",
    "complete positivity in reduced dynamics is the very common - sensical idea that the open - system dynamics must preserve the positivity of a system s density matrix ( a necessary condition for the probability interpretation to hold )  in the presence of any other _ non - interacting _ system .",
    "building on this notion , two seminal contributions have been made .",
    "kraus established an `` operator - sum representation '' which describes the most general completely - positive linear map on the density matrix of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "this is a formal representation of the dynamics , which has been used profitably in the quantum information processing community @xcite , but is impractical to use for dynamics calculations . to address this",
    ", lindblad has derived the most general completely - positive markovian semigroup master equation for the dynamics of the density matrix @xcite .",
    "this master equation can be integrated and solved to provide the time - development of the system density matrix .",
    "both of these results were derived on the basis of axiomatic quantum mechanics .",
    "while systematically satisfying , this approach nevertheless possesses the disadvantage that the resulting theories are necessarily phenomenological , in the sense that they contain no recipe for deriving their parameters from first principles @xcite .",
    "previous formal approaches therefore suffer from one of two disadvantages .",
    "either the final equations are not necessarily completely positive , or they contain parameters which are not derived from first principles and must therefore be treated as phenomenological . in this paper",
    "we provide a derivation of the semigroup master equation ( sme ) from the kraus operator - sum representation ( osr ) which overcomes both of the above problems .",
    "thus , the sme we derive is completely - positive ( i.e. , it is of lindblad form ) , while we can also provide a recipe for calculating the parameters that appear in the equation .",
    "our technique involves a coarse - graining procedure which leaves us with just one phenomenological parameter : the coarse - graining time - scale @xmath0 .",
    "the work presented here is a continuation and generalization of @xcite , where the derivation of the sme from the osr was provided for the first time . here",
    "we verify the validity of the approach in @xcite , by proving now that the resulting sme is , as required , completely positive ( section  [ sme ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we greatly expand the utility of the derivation by now also showing explicitly how to calculate the parameters that appear in the sme ( section  [ param ] ) . the method uses a perturbative expansion in the system - bath coupling strength .",
    "we apply our formalism to the simple example of a collection of spins coupled to a boson bath , and compare the result to the exact solution ( section  [ example ] ) .",
    "we conclude with an overview and assessment of possible extensions ( section  [ conclusions ] ) .",

    "this is impractical in all but a very few exactly solvable models .",
    "( ii ) it is not clear how to separate out the unitary evolution of the system from the possibly non - unitary one , which occurs from the coupling of the system to the bath and leads to decoherence .",

    "let us summarize : the markovian approximation we introduced gives reliable results for times greater than the course - graining time - scale , which in turn must be greater than the bath cut - off time .",
