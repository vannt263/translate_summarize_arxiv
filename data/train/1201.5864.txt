    "<S> gaining control of the building blocks of magnetic materials and thereby achieving particular characteristics will make possible the design and growth of bespoke magnetic devices . </S>",
    "<S> while progress in the synthesis of molecular materials , and especially coordination polymers , represents a significant step towards this goal , the ability to tune the magnetic interactions within a particular framework remains in its infancy . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate a chemical method which achieves dimensionality selection via preferential inhibition of the magnetic exchange in an @xmath0 antiferromagnet along one crystal direction , switching the system from being quasi - two- to quasi - one - dimensional while effectively maintaining the nearest - neighbour coupling strength .    </S>",
    "<S> coordination polymers are self - organising materials consisting of arrays of metal ions linked via molecular ligands , with non - coordinated counterions supplying charge neutrality . </S>",

    "<S> although it is now possible to generate an assortment of disparate magnetic lattices using this method  @xcite , true control of magnetic exchange interactions implies an ability to adjust selected parameters while keeping others constant . to this end , </S>",
    "<S> a series of coordination polymers based on cu(ii ) ions bridged by pyrazine ( c@xmath1h@xmath1n@xmath2 ) molecules have proven to be highly versatile . in these systems </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that it is possible to alter significantly the primary exchange energies via adjustment of the ligands  @xcite and the counterions  @xcite , or fine - tune the exchange by a few percent via isotopic substitution  @xcite , all the while maintaining the same basic metalpyrazine network . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the power of this strategy by chemically engineering a reduction in the dimensionality of a magnetic system . </S>",
    "<S> after first designing a material based on coordinated planes of cu(ii ) , we adapt the recipe such that the ligand bridges are broken along a specific crystal direction , resulting in a chain - like compound . because the ligand mediating the magnetic interactions in both cases is unchanged , the nearest - neighbour exchange energies of the two materials are found to be equal to each other to within 5% . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in numbers of nearest - neighbours , however , means that the strength of the combined exchange interactions acting on each magnetic ion in the quasi - two - dimensional material is twice that of its quasi - one - dimensional cousin </S>",

    "<S> were added in a 3:1 ratio , previous experience suggesting that to account for the potential for pyo to substitute for pyz , the ligands must initially be in a proportion different to that found in the final product . in order to create a similar sample , but one based on cupyz chains rather than planes , we reduce the pyz : pyo ratio to 2:1 and proceed with the synthesis in a similar way . </S>",

    "<S> the magnetic lattice in a low - dimensional system is not always obvious from an inspection of the crystal structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> verification of the equivalence of the magnetic and structural planes and chains in our materials comes from the angle - dependence of the @xmath31-factor as determined by electron - spin resonance . </S>",
    "<S> to first approximation , the cu(ii ) ions in the planar material have a local octahedral symmetry with a tetragonal distortion along the @xmath7-axis . </S>",
    "<S> in such situations , the unpaired spin in a @xmath52  configuration is expected to occupy the @xmath53 orbital  @xcite , and the @xmath31-factor parallel to the distorted @xmath54-axis takes a larger value than those in the @xmath55-plane ( see discussion in ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the data in fig .  [ pulsed](d ) show that the @xmath31-factor is lowest when the excitation field is applied in the @xmath56-plane , implying that the direction of highest electronic orbital overlap is the cupyz directions , with the strong q2d exchange interactions being mediated via the molecular orbitals of the pyrazine . for the chain - like material , </S>",
    "<S> the distortion is more complicated due to the lower crystal symmetry . nevertheless , using two rotations , the smallest values of the @xmath31-factor </S>",
    "<S> are found to be along the cupyz and cupyo bonds , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pulsed](e ) , implying that again the magnetic orbital is @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for the possibility of good exchange coupling along those bonds , but as the pyo molecules are non - bridging ligands , the q1d magnetism must be mediated along the cupyz chains .    </S>",
    "<S> taken together , these experimental observations paint a complete picture of the two closely - related magnetic systems . from the point of view of magnetic superexchange </S>",
    "<S> , the chain direction in the q1d material looks very similar to the two cupyz directions in the q2d material and so , despite the compositional differences , the primary nearest - neighbour exchange energies remain largely unaltered . at the same time the critical field in the q2d material </S>",
    "<S> is approximately double that for the q1d compound because it has twice the number of nearest neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> the q2d compound is strongly anisotropic , comparable to the most 2d materials yet identified  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested above , this is likely due to the disconnect and staggering that occurs between successive planes . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme anisotropy explains why the zero - field heat capacity was not sensitive to the antiferromagnetic transition observed using @xmath16sr . in the q1d material </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy is less pronounced ( even though the @xmath57 ratio is smaller ) because the chains are not staggered , there are twice as many next - nearest neighbours , and the shortest distance between chains ( along the @xmath9-axis ) is approximately half the interlayer separation in the q2d material .    </S>",
    "<S> these materials showcase the ability to take deliberate control over the magnetic properties of polymeric systems . </S>",
    "<S> the self - organisation of the coordination polymers enables them to spontaneously form crystalline lattices whose structure can be anticipated with a high level of predictability . </S>",
    "<S> it is this predictive power , together with the ability to choose the starting ingredients and the knowledge of the exchange efficiency of various ligands accrued over the past few decades , that permits the preselection of exchange anisotropy . in the cupyz systems we have demonstrated the ability to make this preselection without significantly perturbing the magnitude of the primary interaction strengths , while previous studies of similar materials have highlighted the capacity to tune the exchange couplings without changing the overall dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> thus these compounds represent a promising approach to magnetic crystal engineering , and in particular raise the possibility of generating systems that exhibit higher ordering temperatures and other cooperative phenomena .    </S>",
