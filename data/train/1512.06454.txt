    "this re - calibration is done on a regular basis ( as new information becomes available ) .",
    "this implies that model parameters are not static and , henceforth , may also be understood as stochastic processes . the re - calibration should preserve the no - arbitrage condition , which provides side constraints in the re - calibration .",
    "the aim of this work is to discuss these side constraints with the help of the discrete - time multifactor vasiek interest rate model , which is a tractable , but also flexible model .",
    "we show that re - calibration under the side constraints naturally leads to heath  jarrow  morton @xcite models with stochastic parameters , which we call consistent re - calibration ( crc ) models @xcite .",
