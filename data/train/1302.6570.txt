    "wyner introduced the wiretap channel in which a legitimate transmitter wants to have secure communications with a legitimate receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper , and determined its capacity - equivocation region for the degraded case @xcite .",
    "csiszar and korner extended this result to the general , not necessarily degraded , wiretap channel @xcite .",
    "leung - yan - cheong and hellman determined the capacity - equivocation region of the gaussian wiretap channel @xcite .",
    "this line of research has been subsequently extended to many multi - user settings . here , we are particularly interested in models with multiple independent legitimate transmitters , e.g. , interference channel with confidential messages @xcite , interference channel with external eavesdroppers @xcite , multiple access wiretap channel @xcite , wiretap channel with helpers @xcite , and relay - eavesdropper channel with deaf helpers @xcite .",
    "since in most multi - user scenarios it is difficult to obtain the exact secrecy capacity region , recently , there has been a significant interest in studying the asymptotic performance of these systems at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in terms of their secure degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    "achievable secure has been studied for several channel structures , such as the @xmath2-user gaussian interference channel with confidential messages @xcite , @xmath2-user interference channel with external eavesdroppers @xcite in ergodic fading setting @xcite , gaussian wiretap channel with helpers @xcite , gaussian multiple access wiretap channel @xcite in ergodic fading setting @xcite , multiple antenna compound wiretap channel @xcite , and wireless @xmath3 network @xcite .",
    "the exact sum secure was found for a large class of one - hop wireless networks , including the wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers , two - user interference channel with confidential messages , and @xmath2-user multiple access wiretap channel in @xcite , and for all two - unicast layered wireless networks in @xcite .     helpers . ]        in this paper , we revisit the gaussian wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers , see fig .  [",
    "fig : gwc_helper_general ] .",
    "the secrecy capacity of the gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is the difference between the individual channel capacities of the transmitter - receiver and the transmitter - eavesdropper pairs .",
    "this difference does not scale with the snr , and hence the secure of the gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero , indicating a severe penalty due to secrecy .",
    "it has been known that the secrecy rates can be improved if there are helpers which can transmit independent signals @xcite , however , if the helpers transmit i.i.d .",
    "gaussian signals , then the secure is still zero @xcite .",
    "it has been also known that positive secure could be achieved if the helpers sent structured signals @xcite , but the exact secure was unknown .",
    "references @xcite determined the exact secure of the gaussian wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers to be @xmath1 .",
    "this result was derived under the assumption that the eavesdropper s csi was available at the transmitters . in the present paper , we show that the same secure can be achieved even when the eavesdropper s csi is unknown at the legitimate transmitters .",
    "this result is practically significant because , generally , it is difficult or impossible to obtain the eavesdropper s csi . since the upper bound developed in @xcite is valid for this case also , we thus determine the exact secure of the gaussian wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers with no eavesdropper csi to be @xmath1 .",
    "the achievable scheme in the case of no eavesdropper csi here is significantly different than the achievable scheme with eavesdropper csi developed in @xcite .    in particular , in @xcite ,",
    "the legitimate transmitter divides its message into @xmath0 sub - messages and sends them on @xmath0 different _ irrational dimensions_. each one of the helpers sends a cooperative jamming signal .",
    "the message signals and the cooperative jamming signals are sent in such a way that : 1 ) the cooperative jamming signals are aligned at the legitimate receiver in the same irrational dimension , so that they occupy the smallest possible space at the legitimate receiver to enable the decodability of the message signals , and 2 ) each cooperative jamming signal is aligned exactly in the same irrational dimension with one of the message signals at the eavesdropper to protect it .",
    "this scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gwc_no_csi_one_helper_ia ] for @xmath4 helpers . in @xcite , we used insights from @xcite to show that , when a cooperative jamming signal is aligned with a message signal in the same irrational dimension at the eavesdropper , this alignment protects the message signal , and limits the information leakage rate to the eavesdropper by a constant which does not depend on the transmit power . meanwhile , due to the alignment of the cooperative jamming signals in a small space at the legitimate receiver , the information rate to the legitimate receiver can be made to scale with the transmit power .",
    "we use this real interference alignment @xcite based approach to achieve a secure of @xmath1 for _ almost all channel gains _ , and develop a converse to show that it is in fact the secure capacity .",
    "the achievable scheme in the present paper again divides the message into @xmath0 sub - messages .",
    "each one of the helpers sends a cooperative jamming signal . as a major difference from the achievable scheme in @xcite , in this achievable scheme , the legitimate transmitter also sends a cooperative jamming signal .",
    "this scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gwc_no_csi_one_helper_no_csi_ia ] for @xmath4 helpers . in this case , the message signals and the cooperative jamming signals are sent in such a way that : 1 ) all @xmath5 cooperative jamming signals are aligned at the legitimate receiver in the same irrational dimension , and 2 ) all cooperative jamming signals span the _ entire space _ at the eavesdropper to limit the information leakage to the eavesdropper .",
    "we use insights from @xcite , which developed a new achievable scheme that achieved the same secure as in @xcite without eavesdropper csi , to show that the information leakage to the eavesdropper is upper bounded by a function , which can be made arbitrarily small . on the other hand , since the cooperative jamming signals occupy the smallest space at the legitimate receiver , the information rate to the legitimate receiver can be made to scale with the transmit power . in this achievable scheme ,",
    "we let the legitimate transmitter and the helpers _ blindly _ cooperative jam the eavesdropper .",
    "because of the inefficiency of _ blind _ cooperative jamming , here , we had to use more cooperative jamming signals than in @xcite , i.e. , in @xcite we use a total of @xmath0 cooperative jamming signals from the helpers , while here we use @xmath5 cooperative jamming signals , one of which coming from the legitimate transmitter .",
    "the gaussian wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers , see fig .  [",
    "fig : gwc_helper_general ] , is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the channel output of the legitimate receiver , @xmath8 is the channel output of the eavesdropper , @xmath9 is the channel input of the legitimate transmitter , @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , are the channel inputs of the @xmath0 helpers , @xmath12 is the channel gain of the @xmath13th transmitter to the legitimate receiver , @xmath14 is the channel gain of the @xmath13th transmitter to the eavesdropper , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two independent zero - mean unit - variance gaussian random variables .",
    "all channel inputs satisfy average power constraints , @xmath17 \\le p$ ] , for @xmath18 .",
    "transmitter @xmath19 intends to send a message @xmath20 , uniformly chosen from a set @xmath21 , to the legitimate receiver ( receiver @xmath19 ) .",
    "the rate of the message is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of channel uses .",
    "transmitter @xmath19 uses a stochastic function @xmath24 to encode the message , where @xmath25 is the @xmath23-length channel input .",
    "we use boldface letters to denote @xmath23-length vector signals , e.g. , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , etc .",
    "the legitimate receiver decodes the message as @xmath28 based on its observation @xmath29 .",
    "a secrecy rate @xmath30 is said to be achievable if for any @xmath31 there exists an @xmath23-length code such that receiver @xmath19 can decode this message reliably , i.e. , the probability of decoding error is less than @xmath32 , @xmath33 \\le \\epsilon\\ ] ] and the message is kept information - theoretically secure against the eavesdropper , @xmath34 i.e. , that the uncertainty of the message @xmath20 , given the observation @xmath35 of the eavesdropper , is almost equal to the entropy of the message .",
    "the supremum of all achievable secrecy rates is the secrecy capacity @xmath36 , and the secure d.o.f . , @xmath37 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath38    note that @xmath39 is an upper bound . to avoid trivial cases , we assume that @xmath40 and @xmath41 . without the independent helpers , i.e. , @xmath42 , and with full knowledge of all channel gains , the secrecy capacity of the gaussian wiretap channel",
    "is known @xcite @xmath43 and from the secure is zero .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath44 . if there exists a @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then a lower bound of @xmath19 secure can be obtained for this channel by letting this helper jam the eavesdropper by i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noise of power @xmath49 and keeping all other helpers silent .",
    "this lower bound matches the upper bound , giving the secure on the other hand , if there exists a @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then this helper can be removed from the channel model without affecting the secure d.o.f .",
    "therefore , in the rest of the paper , we assume that @xmath52 and @xmath50 and @xmath48 for all @xmath53 .",
    "in this section , we propose an achievable scheme to achieve the secure of @xmath1 with no eavesdropper csi at any of the transmitters .",
    "the only assumption we make is that the legitimate transmitter knows an upper bound of @xmath54 on the eavesdropper channel gains .",
    "let @xmath55 be mutually independent discrete random variables , each of which uniformly drawn from the same pam constellation @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a positive integer and @xmath59 is a real number used to normalize the transmission power , and is also the minimum distance between the points belonging to @xmath56 .",
    "exact values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 will be specified later .",
    "we choose the input signal of the legitimate transmitter as @xmath60 where @xmath61 are rationally independent among themselves and also rationally independent of all channel gains .",
    "the input signal of the @xmath45th helper , @xmath62 , is chosen as @xmath63 note that , neither the legitimate transmitter signal in ( [ legit - signal ] ) nor the helper signals in ( [ helper - signal ] ) depend on the eavesdropper csi @xmath64 . with these selections , observations of the receivers",
    "are given by , @xmath65    the intuition here is as follows : we use @xmath0 independent sub - signals @xmath66 , @xmath67 , to represent the original message @xmath20 .",
    "the input signal @xmath9 is a linear combination of @xmath66s and a jamming signal @xmath68 . at the legitimate receiver ,",
    "all of the cooperative jamming signals , @xmath69s , are aligned such that they occupy a small portion of the signal space .",
    "since @xmath70 are rationally independent for all channel gains , except for a set of lebesgue measure zero , the signals @xmath71 can be distinguished by the legitimate receiver .",
    "in addition , we observe that @xmath72 are rationally independent , and therefore , @xmath73 _ span _ the _ entire space _ at the eavesdropper ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : gwc_no_csi_one_helper_no_csi_ia ] . here , by the _",
    "entire space _ , we mean the maximum number of _ dimensions _ that the eavesdropper is capable of decoding , which is @xmath5 in this case . since the _ entire space _ at the eavesdropper is occupied by the cooperative jamming signals , the message signals @xmath74 are secure , as we will mathematically prove in the sequel .",
    "since , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence and is independent of @xmath77 , the following secrecy rate is achievable @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "first , we use fano s inequality to bound the first term in .",

    "then , we can upper bound the probability of decoding error of such a pam scheme by considering the additive gaussian noise at receiver @xmath19 , @xmath87 & \\le \\exp\\left (   - \\frac{d_{min}^2}{8}\\right )    \\\\ & \\le \\exp\\left (   - \\frac{a^2k_\\delta^2}{8 ( ( m+1)q)^{2(m+\\delta)}}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the estimate of @xmath89 by choosing the closest point in the constellation based on observation @xmath7 . for any @xmath84 , if we choose @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a constant independent of @xmath49 , then @xmath93 & \\le \\exp\\left ( -\\frac{k_\\delta^2 \\gamma^2 ( m+1)^2 p}{8 ( ( m+1)q)^{2(m+\\delta)+2 } } \\right ) \\\\ &   = \\exp\\left ( -\\frac{k_\\delta^2 \\gamma^2 ( m+1)^2 p^\\delta}{8 ( m+1)^{2(m+1+\\delta ) } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we can have @xmath94 \\to 0 $ ] as @xmath95 . to satisfy the power constraint at the transmitters , we can simply choose @xmath96^{-1},|h_2| , |h_3| , \\cdots ,    chain @xmath97 , we know that @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath92 are fixed , and @xmath100 is the little-@xmath101 function .",
    "this means that @xmath102    next , we need to bound the second term in , @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the upper bound on @xmath106 defined at the beginning of this section , and is due to the fact that given @xmath89 and @xmath107 , the eavesdropper can decode @xmath108 with probability of error approaching zero since @xmath72 are rationally independent for all channel gains , except for a set of lebesgue measure zero .",
    "then , by fano s inequality , @xmath109 similar to the step in .    combining and",
    ", we have @xmath110 where again @xmath100 is the little-@xmath101 function .",
    "if we choose @xmath99 arbitrarily small , then we can achieve @xmath1 secure for this model where there is no eavesdropper csi at the transmitters .",
    "we studied the gaussian wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers without any eavesdropper csi at the transmitters .",
    "we proposed an achievable scheme that achieves a secure of @xmath1 , which is the same as the secure reported in @xcite when the transmitters had perfect eavesdropper csi .",
    "the new achievability scheme is based on real interference alignment and _ blind _ cooperative jamming . while @xcite aligned cooperative jamming signals with the information symbols at the eavesdropper to protect the information symbols , which required eavesdropper csi , here we used one more cooperative jamming signal to span the _ entire space _ at the eavesdropper to protect the information symbols . as in @xcite , here also , we aligned all of the cooperative jamming signals in the same dimension at the legitimate receiver , in order to occupy the smallest space at the legitimate receiver to allow for the decodability of the information symbols .",
