    "in wireless communication systems , a channel is called line - of - sight ( los ) if a direct link between the transmitter and the receiver is always present .",
    "information delivery over los channels is an important kind of data transmission in modern wireless systems , with numerous applications including satellite communications , indoor communications , and near - base - station communications .",
    "a typical far - field multiple - input single - output ( miso ) los channel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7.22 ) takes the form @xmath0 with @xmath1^t$ ] , where @xmath2 is the carrier wavelength , @xmath3 is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver , @xmath4 is the normalized receiver antenna separation ( normalized to the unit of the carrier wavelength ) , and @xmath5 is the attenuation of the path . the magnitude of the los channel @xmath6 is determined solely by the path attenuation @xmath5 , which usually varies slowly and is easy to estimate in practice @xcite . by contrast",
    ", the phase @xmath7 depends on many factors such as distance , antenna position , and oscillator offsets.s .",
    "the design of such channels is beyond the scope of this work . ] in real - world systems , errors in those factors may originate from long distance transmission delay @xcite ( e.g. , for satellite channels ) , asynchronous carrier frequency ( e.g. , cheap oscillators in mobile terminals ) , or arrival delay at different antennas .",
    "therefore , phase error has a more dominant effect in los channels .",
    "although there is a vast literature on robust beamforming for los channels , to our best knowledge , not much has been done to incorporate phase error in the noise model .",
    "two related works we are aware of are those by el - keyi and champagne @xcite and gharanjik et al @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study collaborative uplink beamforming for los channels with phase errors and model them as @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the uncertainty .",
    "this model is additive in nature ( with respect to @xmath7 ) and the channel magnitude is subject to change .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite propose modeling the phase error by adding a gaussian noise directly to the phases of the entries of @xmath7 .",
    "such a multiplicative noise model is attractive from a modeling perspective .",
    "however , this model results in a substantially more difficult design problem .    in this paper , we are interested in the robust beamforming design for the miso downlink multicast los channel under the same phase error model as in @xcite ( the applicability of our approach is actually not limited to miso multicasting ) . specifically , we consider the power minimization problem subject to probabilistic outage constraints .",
    "such constraints involve random trigonometric forms , which have rarely been addressed in the beamforming literature . to obtain more tractable approximations of the probabilistic constraints",
    ", we propose to approximate the random trigonometric form by a second - order taylor expansion and then apply the bernstein - type inequality approach in @xcite .",
    "the resulting formulation can then be tackled by the semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) technique , thereby leading to an approximately optimal beamformer . to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach ,",
    "we compare our method with that in @xcite by simulations .",
    "the results show that the proposed design approach is less conservative and require less transmit power than the gaussian approximation ( ga ) approach in @xcite .",
    "we consider the physical - layer multicasting channel , where a base station with @xmath10 antennas intends to transmit a common signal to @xmath11 single - antenna receivers .",
    "suppose that the channel is quasi - static and we consider the transmit design for each code block .",
    "as such , we shall omit the time index from the notations henceforth . for @xmath12 , let @xmath13 denote the estimated channel for user @xmath14 and we focus on the problem of beamforming design that is robust against the phase error of the channel .",
    "specifically , we model the phase error of the @xmath14-th channel by a gaussian random vector @xmath15 . denoting @xmath16 ,",
    "the corrupted channel for user @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the entry - wise product .",
    "let @xmath19 be the common unit - power signal intended for all users . before transmission",
    ", the signal will be precoded by a precoding vector @xmath20 and the resulting signal for transmission is @xmath21 . after passing through the channels , the signal obtained at the @xmath14-th receiver is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the additive noise at user @xmath14 and",
    "is assumed to be gaussian distributed with mean zero and variance @xmath24 .",
    "also , the random variables / vectors @xmath25 are assumed to be independent .    as usual , the quality - of - service ( qos ) at user @xmath14 is measured by the snr : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the operator on the space of hermitian matrices given by @xmath28 we say that user @xmath14 is in outage if @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a prescribed threshold .",
    "a natural formulation of the beamforming design problem is to minimize the power while maintaining a low outage probability : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 s are the outage probabilities . assuming @xmath33 and letting @xmath34 , we can equivalently write as @xmath35 recall that we have @xmath16 and @xmath15 . problem ( p ) is difficult to handle since we do not have a good analytic description of the probabilistic constraint . in @xcite",
    ", the authors work around this by approximating @xmath36 by a gaussian random variable with matching mean and covariance .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive a more accurate and efficient alternative to handle .",
    "in this section , we use a taylor series approximation and the bernstein - type inequality to tackle . specifically , by considering the second - order taylor expansion of the random variables",
    "@xmath36 , we transform the outage probability into the large deviation of a quadratic function in gaussian random variables .",
    "the probabilistic constraint can then be handled by the bernstein - type inequality approach @xcite .",
    "finally , by employing the sdr technique , we obtain a tractable approximation of the probabilistic constraint .",
    "let us first introduce some notations .",
    "denote by @xmath37 and @xmath38 the sets of @xmath39 real symmetric and skew - symmetric matrices respectively .",
    "given any arbitrary matrix @xmath40 with its @xmath41-th element denoted by @xmath42 , let @xmath43 be the linear map given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the linear map given by @xmath46 to build our approximation , we need the following two lemmas , whose proofs are relegated to the appendix .",
    "[ quadratic_appr ] let @xmath47 , @xmath48^t$ ] , and @xmath49 be an @xmath39 hermitian matrix with symmetric real part @xmath50 and skew - symmetric imaginary part @xmath51 .",
    "then , the second - order taylor approximation of @xmath52 is given by @xmath53    lemma [ quadratic_appr ] allows us to approximate the hard probabilistic constraint by a more well - studied one . in particular , if @xmath54 and @xmath55 is small , then we should have @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the standard @xmath10-dimensional gaussian random vector .",
    "given the above approximation , it suffices to approximate the right hand side of , which can be achieved using the following lemma :    [ cc_to_sdp ] let @xmath58 be a solution to the system @xmath59 then , @xmath60 satisfies @xmath61    with a slight abuse of notation , we write @xmath62 [ system_s ] if there exist @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that @xmath58 is feasible to the system . also , let @xmath67 and @xmath68 be the real and imaginary parts of @xmath69 , respectively . using lemmas [ quadratic_appr ] and [ cc_to_sdp ] , we obtain the following approximation of problem ( p ) : @xmath70 by dropping the non - convex rank - one constraint , we arrive at @xmath71    problem ( apr ) is an instance of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) and hence can be solved efficiently by any off - the - shelf sdp solver @xcite .",
    "the optimal solution @xmath72 to problem ( apr ) can be of any rank because we drop the rank constraint .",
    "for ease of presentation , we consider the problem instances where problems ( p ) , ( ap ) , and ( apr ) are feasible .",
    "then , to extract a rank - one solution from @xmath73 , we can use gaussian rounding ( see algorithm [ alg ] ) to obtain a vector beamformer @xmath74 such that @xmath75 is approximately feasible to problem ( p ) .",
    "we remark that although problem ( apr ) is convex and tractable , its feasible region is not necessarily included in that of ( p ) and hence theoretically the beamformer @xmath74 can fail to satisfy the original outage probability requirement . however , our numerical results in the next section show that the proposed approximation is actually _ empirically safe _ under our scenario settings : all the outage probabilities given by @xmath74 are always smaller than @xmath32 s .",

    "output : a beamformer @xmath81 with @xmath83 feasible to ( ap ) .",
    "in this section , we provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed robust design .",
    "the setup of the experiment is as follows : the number of transmit antennas is @xmath84 ; the number of users served is @xmath85 ; channels are generated by @xmath86 independently ; the noise power at each user is set to be @xmath87 ; the phase error variance is @xmath88 ; the snr outage probability is set to be @xmath89 .",
    "we averaged @xmath90 channel realizations to get the plots .    in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we show the minimum power required to satisfy the outage constraints as the snr threshold varies from @xmath91db to @xmath92db when @xmath93 .",
    "specifically , we compare the ga design in @xcite with the proposed design ( called tb in the legend ) . from the plots",
    ", we see that the optimal values of the sdrs serve as lower bounds of the respective beamforming schemes . in the legend , `` sdr ''",
    "refers to the values obtained by the sdrs prior to rounding and `` bf '' refers to the actual power required by the beamformers produced by the rounding .",
    "the figure shows that the proposed tb approach needs a lower power budget than the ga approach in @xcite . to investigate the conservatism",
    ", we plot the histogram of the snr satisfaction probability of the beamformers obtained by different schemes ; see figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "in the non - robust approach , the channel errors are simply ignored and the problem reduces to the classical physical - layer multicasting design problem @xcite .",
    "the non - robust histogram reveals that if we do not take phase error into account , the outage probability requirement could be seriously violated and the system is totally unreliable .",
    "this actually demonstrates the importance of the robust designs .",
    "for the ga approach , the snr satisfaction probability is always @xmath87 under our setting .",
    "this means that the ga scheme sacrifices extra transmit power for unnecessary conservatism .",
    "this is also manifested in figure [ fig:1 ] . for the proposed tb approach",
    ", we see that the snr satisfaction probability is less than @xmath87 but exceeds the target threshold @xmath94 . hence , the proposed tb approach is reliable but less conservative than the ga counterpart .",
    "both figures demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tb design .",
    "in this paper , we study the robust design for los channels with phase uncertainty . in particular , we consider the miso physical - layer multicasting scenario and aim at minimizing the transmit power subject to probabilistic snr constraints .",
    "we employ taylor series , a bernstein - type inequality and the sdr technique to approximate the probabilistic snr constraints by sdps , from which an approximate beamformer can be obtained . according to our simulation results ,",
    "the robust design is important when phase error is present .",
    "furthermore , the proposed method is less conservative and requires lower transmit power when compared with the existing design approach based on gaussian approximations .",
    "one future direction is to extend the proposed method to study more general los channels with reflected paths .",
