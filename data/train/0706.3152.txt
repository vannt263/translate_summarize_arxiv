    "the calculus on time scales was introduced by stefan hilger during his phd project , carried out under the scientific supervision of bernd aulbach .",

    "the calculus on time scales has a very similar notation with the differential calculus .",
    "when one is not carefully enough , this leads to `` results '' without any meaning .",
    "this means that extra care must be taken when dealing with problems on time scales .    in this note",
    "we show and highlight some weaknesses that may arise when proving results on a general time scale .",
    "such weaknesses can be of various kinds and we hope that by the end of this note they can be better understood .    unless the contrary , throughout the text the notation conforms to that used in the references .",

    ", we will make some observations about the proof of the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations and the derivation of the euler - lagrange equation in @xcite .",
    "the fundamental lemma for the one independent variable problem of the calculus of variations on time scales , as stated in @xcite , is ( here we do not use the notation of @xcite ) :    ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we first note that in differential calculus , a @xmath76 function is ( by definition ) a function that possess a derivative and this derivative is continuous .",
    "therefore , it is natural that in the context of time scales , the notation @xmath76 should mean that a function has a delta derivative and that the delta derivative is continuous .",
    "the proof of the lemma is made in various steps ( cases ) .",

    "it is constructed a function @xmath79 that is positive in the same points of @xmath8 and zero at the other points . in case @xmath80 of the proof in @xcite ,",
    "the authors intend to show that the lemma is true for left - dense points ( independently of the points being right - dense or right - scattered ) .",

    "this is due to the fact that if @xmath27 is such a point , then @xmath88 by ( [ rui5 ] ) , it immediately follows that @xmath89 is not continuous at @xmath84 . clearly",
    ", analogous observations to those above can be made to the double integral problem .",
    "now we turn our attention to @xcite . there , after applying the integration by parts formula with respect to @xmath90 , it appears the following term within a formula ( see @xcite for a better comprehension of the notation ) :    @xmath91 by definition , @xmath92 , so by the same reasoning as we did before , we may say that @xmath93 does nt make sense .",
    "however , it is possible to bypass this problem and we shall show how .",
    "multiple integration on time scales was introduced in @xcite .",
    "there , it is defined the double riemann integral .",
    "we use this concept and we define the problem of minimizing the functional @xmath94 among all the functions @xmath95 that have partial derivatives of the second order with respect to its arguments , and that become a given continuous function on the boundary of @xmath96\\times[a_2,b_2]\\subset\\mathbb{t}_1\\times\\mathbb{t}_2 $ ] . we assume that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are delta differentiable .",

    "continuity of @xmath8 ensures that @xmath8 is positive in @xmath134 .",

    "* theorem  2.25 ) ) . if @xmath149 c@xmath141 , why should those partial derivatives be continuous ?",
    "a justification to this fact could be that the authors , when enunciating theorem  5.2 ( euler s necessary condition ) , assume that the admissible functions have continuous partial delta derivatives of the second order , hence it would be implicit that the admissible variations should belong to the same class .",
