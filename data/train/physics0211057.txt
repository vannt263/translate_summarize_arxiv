    "a pre - eminent challenge in liquid state physics is the understanding of aqueous phase chemical transformations on a molecular scale .",
    "water undergoes limited autoprotolysis , which is enhanced in the presence of highly charged metals , such as be@xmath2 @xcite . understanding the hydration and transport of the autoprotolysis products , h@xmath3 and ho@xmath1 , presents unique and interesting challenges for molecular - scale theories of solutions and for simulations . in this paper",
    "we focus on ho@xmath1(aq ) .",
    "since h@xmath3 and ho@xmath1 constitute the underlying aqueous matrix , it is not unreasonable to expect that their transport in water is different from the transport of other aqueous ions .",
    "this anomalous diffusion of the h@xmath3(aq ) and ho@xmath1(aq ) has received extensive scrutiny over the years ( for example , @xcite ) , but recently _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) capabilities have evolved to provide new information on the solution condition and transport of these species . over a similar period of time , the statistical mechanical theory of liquids ( especially water ) has also become usefully more sophisticated ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "these two approaches can be complementary , but in typical practice they remain imperfectly connected ( but see @xcite ) .    in an initial aimd study @xcite , ho@xmath1(aq )",
    "was observed to be tetra - hydrated during the course of the @xmath46  ps long simulation .",
    "this complex had a lifetime of about 2 - 3  ps .",
    "an approximately square - planar configuration was noted for this @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] complex . that study hinted that transport occurred when @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] converted to a tri - hydrated ( @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] ) species which has hydrogen - bonding arrangements similar to those in liquid water .",
    "a recent aimd study @xcite reinforced the notion of a @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] species exclusively dominating the equilibrium population distribution at infinite dilution .",
    "the proposed mechanism for ho@xmath1(aq ) transport was : first the stable ( and hence inactive ) @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] converts to the active @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] species ; then the h - bond between the anion and one of the ligating water molecules shortens , thus identifying a transient @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] species ; a shared proton is transferred along that shortened bond , and a @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] species is reconstituted with the hydroxide identity now switched ; this active @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] species reverts back to an inactive @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] species completing one transport event .",
    "presumably , as in @xcite , the lifetime of the @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] species was 2 - 3  ps , but statistical characterization was sketchy .",
    "discussions of a transport mechanism for ho@xmath1(aq ) typically focus on agmon s @xcite extraction of an activation energy for hydroxide transport from the temperature dependence of the experimental mobilities .",
    "near room temperature that empirical parameter is about 3  kcal / mol but increases by roughly a factor of two for slightly lower temperatures . as a mechanical barrier",
    "this value , about 5 - 6 @xmath5 , may be low enough to require some subtlety of interpretation @xcite ; the observed temperature sensitivity of the activation energy , and particularly its _ increase _ with decreasing temperature , supports that possibility .",
    "we note that a standard inclusion of a tunneling correction would be expected to lead to a _ decrease _ of activation energy with decreasing temperature",
    ".    however , ref .",
    "@xcite framed the consideration of ho@xmath1 transport in terms of classical transition state theory and extracted an activation energy from the gas - phase study of novoa  _ et  al .",
    "_ @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite also considered the importance of tunneling in lowering the barrier for proton transfer by performing path integral calculations .",
    "their combined value of 3.1  kcal / mol was close to agmon s estimate @xcite .",
    "that experimental number does reflect the influence of the solution medium , and the arrhenius plots are non - linear . additionally , the earlier gas - phase studies @xcite have shown that outer shell disposition of the fourth water molecule @xmath0_3{}^-\\cdot h_2o}$ ] is lower in energy than @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] , in agreement with subsequent experimental results @xcite ; and , further , with a barrier of 2.5  kcal / mol for conversion @xmath0_3{}^-\\cdot h_2o}$ ] to @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] , nearly 1.3  kcal / mol _ greater _ than the barrier for the reverse process .",
    "a follow - up classical aimd study @xcite , which treated a 1.5  m solution of kod ( 1 molecule of od@xmath1 and 1 atom of k@xmath3 in a 32 water molecule system ) , estimated the diffusion coefficient of od@xmath1 to be 2.1  @xmath6/ps .",
    "a tunneling correction for the classical treatment would be expected to increase this rate .",
    "the experimental diffusion coefficient for the light water oh@xmath1 case is about 0.5  @xmath6/ps at 298  k @xcite .",
    "the incongruities in @xcite were noted recently by @xcite in aimd simulations of deuterated naod and kod hydroxide solutions with concentrations ranging between 1.5  m to 15  m @xcite .",
    "interestingly , they observed that @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] was well - represented in the population distribution , and commented that their results @xcite differed somewhat from those obtained in the previous ab initio study @xcite which reported @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] to be the only dominant solvation structure .",
    "the distribution of hydration numbers was markedly influenced by the cations there @xcite .",
    "those results do not permit a consistent extrapolation of ho@xmath1(aq ) properties to infinite dilution , but @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] was just a prominent structure , not the only one .",
    "it is clear that earlier simulations have not resolved the most primitive question : what is the coordination state of ho@xmath1(aq ) in water without extrinsic complications ?",
    "speculations regarding the transport mechanism are somewhat premature in the absence of a clear understanding of this coordination number question . here",
    "we focus on that primitive question first , apply aimd methods , and find that @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] is a probable coordination number .",

    "the inner shell , where chemical effects are important , is treated quantum mechanically .",
    "the outer shell contributions can be assessed using classical force - fields or dielectric continuum models @xcite .",
    "the theory permits a variational check of the partition @xcite .",

    "the fourth water molecule initiates an outer shell around this cluster .",
    "this identification of a shell - closure is in agreement with thermo - chemical measurements that show the same effect @xcite .",
    "thus theoretical considerations and experiments on hydroxide - water clusters concur on the significance of @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] as the nominal full inner shell structure .",

    "ultrasoft pseudopotentials ( us - pp ) @xcite for oxygen were used to describe the core - valence interaction , and an ultrasoft pseudopotential was used for the hydrogen atoms as well@xcite .",

    "run1 used a 1  fs timestep .",

    "the @xmath33 results of table  [ tb : thetas ] document the interesting point that three nearest coordinating protons are physically equivalent and approximately disposed towards the corners of a tetrahedron .",

    "the recent theoretical and experimental work noted in sec .  [ theory ] suggests that the structure @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] does not provide as natural a description of the thermodynamic hydration free energy as does the species @xmath0_3 ^ -}$ ] that follow from a more conservatively defined inner - shell .",
    "it seems likely that an inner - shell definition designed @xcite to better isolate this @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] sub - grouping would be excessively complicated .",
    "this is one reason why @xmath36 is not unambiguously separated by the results of table  [ tb : xs ] .",
    "the identification of @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] as a prominent sub - grouping agrees with spectroscopic studies on concentrated hydroxide solutions .",
    "the ir and raman spectra of concentrated hydroxide solutions have been interpreted in terms of @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] as a principal structural possibility for those systems @xcite .",
    "but the present observations suggest that it is the principal participant in the proton conductivity .",
    "this @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] sub - grouping also concisely resolves the high `` effective '' ( not microscopic ) hydration numbers extracted from dielectric dispersion measurements @xcite .",
    "a ` super'-grouping of hydrated @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] , one involving several more water molecules , could well be relevant to the time scale of the measurement , a possibility also suggested by agmon @xcite .",
    "then a dominating @xmath0_4{}^-}$ ] species @xcite is not a conclusion necessary to the resolution of experimentally obtained `` effective '' hydration numbers .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of ho@xmath1 is calculated to be 3.1  @xmath6/ps at 332  k using pw91 for ho@xmath1 , and 1.1  @xmath6/ps at 313  k using rpbe for do@xmath1 . for comparison ,",
    "zhu and tuckerman s results for do@xmath1 gives 2.1  @xmath6/ps presumably at 300  k @xcite .",
    "the experimental value , calculated from mobility data , is about 0.5  @xmath6/ps for ho@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "perhaps the agreement with experiment of this rpbe result is acceptable , but all these values agree only roughly with experiments .",
    "an important background point is that evaluation of diffusion coefficients typically requires longer simulation times , not readily accessible here by aimd simulation .",
    "rationalizations why the simulation rates are higher than observed experimental rates would be highly speculative . a quantum mechanical treatment of the water matrix , rather than a classical one , would imply less order , and perhaps that would lead to slower rates . or it might be that the electron density functionals used here lead to excessive prominence of the @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] sub - grouping , and that leads to rates that are too high by comparison with experiment .",
    "the fact that the empirical activation energies _ increase _ with decreasing temperature remains an unexplained point , apparently of qualitative significance .",
    "the transport observed here involved the movement of a proton - hole between two tri - hydrated species , which is also consistent with the identification of the @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] sub - grouping and the ir spectra .",
    "second - shell rearrangements do occur , but _ all - or - nothing _ breaking and reforming of a hydrogen bond is not necessary @xcite .",
    "there will certainly be rearrangements as the hole settles into its new place .",
    "the hole - hopping proposal for ho@xmath1 transport , as discussed by bernal and fowler @xcite , hckel @xcite , and later stillinger @xcite , has substantial validity .",
    "we note that aimd studies on pure liquid water @xcite under conventional thermodynamic conditions show that pw91 and pbe predict more strongly structured liquid water compared to experiment , and rpbe softens the structure of liquid water simulated on that basis . the excess chemical potential evaluated in that study @xcite , on the basis of aimd results and the quasi - chemical theory , indicates that pw91 binds liquid water too strongly , whereas rpbe softens the binding .",
    "the excess chemical potential of water at 314  k using the rpbe functional was @xmath37  kcal / mole ( compared with @xmath38  kcal / mole experimentally ) , whereas pw91 gives @xmath39  kcal / mole at 330  k. despite these differences , the hydration structure of ho@xmath1(aq ) and the qualitative transport pattern are similar in these two cases .",
    "therefore , the above comparisons can be more optimistic for providing the correct direction to frame discussions on ho@xmath1 transport .",
    "three distinct lines of investigation , theory @xcite , experiments @xcite , and the present simulations @xcite , converge on the common view that @xmath0_3{}^-}$ ] is a prominent , likely even dominating coordination structure for ho@xmath1 ( aq ) ; this is the most primitive issue underlying current speculations regarding ho@xmath1 in aqueous solutions .",
    "the present simulation results suggest , in addition , that the coordination number distribution is labile , includes less specifically structured @xmath29=4 possibilities , and that @xmath0 ^ -}$ ] is a prominent sub - grouping within larger inner shell structures .",
    "this latter point is consistent with interpretations of aqueous phase spectroscopic @xcite results , and also with proposals of high - effective solvation numbers on the basis of dielectric dispersion measurements @xcite .",
