    "the simplest physical model describing the random motion of a non - relativistic brownian particle is given by the langevin equation , which can be written as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ( non - relativistic ) momentum , and the three terms of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) correspond to the friction , to an external force @xmath2 , and to a stochastic force @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "@xmath4 is a coefficient called the friction coefficient . due to the friction term",
    ", the particle in brownian motion loses energy to the medium , but simultaneously gains energy from the random kicks of the thermal bath , modeled by the random force .",
    "the random force , which we assume to be a white noise , satisfies the conditions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , where @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "the separation of the force into frictional and random parts is merely a phenomenological simplification - microscopically , the two forces have the same origin ( collision with the external medium constituents ) .",
    "the langevin equation has a large range of applications in physics , astrophysics , engineering , biology etc . @xcite .",
    "an exact formulation of the physics of barnett relaxation , based on a realistic kinetic model of the relaxation mechanism which includes the alignment of the grain angular momentum in body coordinates by barnett dissipation , disalignment by thermal fluctuations , and coupling of the angular momentum to the gas via gas damping was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for the measure of internal alignment was solved by using numerical integration of the equivalent langevin equation for brownian rotation .",
    "it was also shown that in a steady state , energy is transferred back to the grain material at an equal rate by barnett dissipation .",
    "a simple physical model to describe the dynamics of a massive point - like object , such as a black hole , near the center of a dense stellar system was developed in @xcite .",
    "the total force on the massive body can be separated into two independent parts , one of which is the slowly varying influence of the aggregate stellar system , and the other being the rapidly fluctuating stochastic force due to discrete encounters with individual stars .",
    "the motion of the black hole is similar to that of a brownian particle in a harmonic potential , and its dynamics can be analyzed by using an approach based on the langevin equation . by numerically solving the langevin equation one can obtain the average values , time - autocorrelation functions , and probability distributions of the black hole s position and velocity . by using this model a lower limit on the mass of the black hole sgr a * in the galactic center",
    "can be derived .",
    "a langevin  type treatment of the motion of a charged particle in the inter - galactic medium magnetic field , which allows to estimate both the average and of the root mean square time - delay for particles of given energy , was introduced in @xcite .",

    "the generalized thermodynamics and the collapse of a system of self - gravitating langevin particles exhibiting anomalous diffusion in a space of dimension d was considered in @xcite .",

    "there are many processes in the accretion of material onto an active galactic nuclei that occur on relatively short timescales as compared to the cooling time of the x - ray emitting gas in and around elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "accretion rates onto active galactic nuclei are likely to be extremely variable on short timescales . using a langevin type equation @xcite",
    "has shown that , for a simple feedback system , this can induce variability in the active galactic nuclei power output that is of much larger amplitude , and persists for longer timescales , than the initial fluctuations .",
    "an implication of this result is that rich galaxy clusters are expected to show the largest and longest - lived fluctuations .",
    "stochastic variations in the accretion rate also mean that the active galactic nuclei injects energy across a wide range of timescales .",
    "accretion disks around compact objects have become standard models for a number of astrophysical phenomena like x - ray binaries or active galactic nuclei .",
    "the disks are usually considered as being composed from massive test particles that move in the gravitational field of the central compact object . waves and normal - mode oscillations in geometrically thin and thick disks around compact objects have been studied extensively both within newtonian gravity ( see @xcite 2001 for a review ) and within a relativistic framework @xcite .",
    "the oscillations of the accretion disks may produce the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo s ) @xcite in black hole low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to propose a fully general relativistic model for the description of the oscillations of the particles in the accretion disks around compact objects in contact with an external heat bath .",
    "the oscillations of the disk , assumed to interact with an external medium ( the heat bath ) , are described by a general relativistic langevin equation , which is derived , for the case of a general axisymmetric gravitational field , by considering the perturbations of the geodesic equation describing the motion of test particles in stable circular orbits .",
    "the energy transport in the presence of the stochastic fluctuations of the disk is discussed in detail . as an application of our general formalism we consider in detail the vertical stochastic oscillations of the accretion disks in both the static schwarzschild and rotating kerr geometries . in these cases",
    "the equations of motion of the disk can be formulated as langevin equations , describing the interaction between the disk and an external thermal bath . by numerically integrating the corresponding langevin equation",
    "we obtain the vertical displacements , velocities , and the luminosities of the stochastically oscillating disks .",

    "the friction force is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath4 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath49 are the components of the non - relativistic velocity .",

    "the interaction between the medium and the disk , the motion of the particles in the disk has essentially a stochastic nature . to obtain the equations of motion of the perturbed disk we have generalized the approach introduced in @xcite and @xcite , by introducing in the equations of the perturbed geodesic lines a dissipative viscous term , and a stochastic force term , respectively .",
    "the equations of the motion of the fluctuating disk have been obtained in both the equatorial and the vertical plane , as well as the general stochastic energy transfer equation .",
    "we have studied in detail the vertical oscillations of the disk , and we have shown that in this case the motion is described by a standard langevin type differential equation for an harmonic oscillator , with a geometry dependent oscillation frequency . by numerically integrating the equation of motion",
    "we have obtained the vertical displacements , velocities and the luminosity of the disk in the cases of both schwarzschild and kerr geometries .",
    "fluctuations of accretion disks around super - massive black holes may have important astrophysical applications .",
    "the emission of galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) displays a significant aperiodic variability on a broad range of time - scales .",
    "the power spectral density of such variability is generally modeled with a power law , @xmath230 , where power - law index @xmath211 keeps a constant value in a certain range of @xmath231 , but changes among different ranges . at high frequencies , the psds of both bhbs and agns present a steep slope with @xmath232 . on the contrary , below a break frequency , typically at a few hz for bhbs , they flatten to a slope with @xmath233 , representing the so - called flicker noise @xcite .",
    "however , the observed power spectra often deviate from the form @xmath234 .",
    "for example , the psd of cyg x-1 is well described with the form @xmath234 in the soft state , but in the hard state it exhibits the form @xmath235 @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the power - law index is around @xmath236 both in the soft state of bhbs and in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .    in the case of the present model of the disk oscillations under the effect of some stochastic forces",
    "@xmath237 , the resulting power spectral density is of the form @xmath238 .",
    "this result can be understood qualitatively by noting that @xmath239dt}\\propto if^{-1}\\int ^t{\\exp\\left(ift\\right)\\xi ( t)dt}$ ] , which gives @xmath240 , since @xmath237 is a stochastic variable .",
    "this result is generally also valid for harmonically oscillating , undamped disks , and consequently it is independent of the general relativistic corrections to the equation of motion , since these only change the oscillation frequency of the compact object - disk system .",
    "however , as pointed out previously , observations of bhbs and agns have shown that the spectral index is not @xmath241 , but it is either @xmath242 , or , more generally , @xmath243 .",
    "such a dispersion of the power - law index reveals that there must exist some other mechanisms , different from purely stochastic oscillations , which may be responsible for the observed value of @xmath211 , like , for example , hydrodynamic fluctuations , magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , magnetic flares , density fluctuations in the corona , or variations of the accretion rate , caused by small amplitude variations in the viscosity @xcite .    in a model introduced in @xcite",
    "aperiodic x - ray fluctuations are thought to originate from instabilities of the accretion disk around a black hole . to describe these type of fluctuations",
    "a cellular automaton model was proposed @xcite . in this model , a gas particle",
    "is randomly injected into an accretion disk surrounding a black hole .",
    "when the mass density of the disk exceeds some critical value at a certain point , an instability develops , and the accumulated matter begins to drift inward as an avalanche , thereby emitting x - rays . within the framework of this model , one can generate @xmath244 - like fluctuations in the x - ray luminosity , in spite of the random mass injection .",
    "a similar model can be used to explain the optical - ultraviolet `` flickering '' variability in cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "light fluctuations are produced by occasional flare - like events , and subsequent avalanche flow in the accretion disk atmospheres .",
    "stochastic oscillations of the accretion disks can also provide an alternative model for the explanation of the observed intra - day variability in bl lac objects , and for other similar transient events @xcite .",
    "the basic physical idea of this model is that the source of the intra - day variability can be related to some stochastic oscillations of the disk , triggered by the interaction of the disk with the central supermassive black hole , as well as with a background cosmic environment , which perturbs the disk . to explain the observed light curve behavior , a model for the stochastic oscillations of the disk was developed , by taking into account the gravitational interaction with the central object , the viscous type damping forces generated in the disk , and a stochastic component which describes the interaction with the cosmic environment .",
    "the stochastic oscillation model can reproduce the aperiodic light curves associated with transient astronomical phenomena .",
    "random or fluctuating phenomena can be found in many natural processes . in the present paper",
    "we have investigated the stochastic properties of the oscillating general relativistic thin accretion disks , and we have introduced an approach in which the stochastic processes related to disk instabilities can be described in a unitary approach by a langevin type equation that includes both the deterministic , general relativistic , and the random forces acting on the accretion disks .",
    "our results can be considered only as a first step in the investigation of the stochastic properties of the general relativistic accretion disks . in order to obtain a more accurate determination of the relevant physical parameters of the disks , and to determine more exactly the possible astrophysical applications of the model",
    ", it would be important to also investigate the radial stochastic oscillations of the disks around compact general relativistic objects .",
