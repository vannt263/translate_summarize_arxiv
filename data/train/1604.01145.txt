    "the study of quantum spin - glass has a long history dating back to the early seminal work of bray and moore on the random quantum heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "many different models @xcite as well as theoretical methods @xcite for studying them have since been proposed . in most of these earlier works ,",
    "the approach is mainly a mean field one based on a combination of suzuki - trotter decomposition and replica theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , quantum spin - glasses have attracted attention within the context of quantum annealing @xcite and adiabatic quantum computation @xcite . here , the quantity of interest is the energy gap between the ground and first excited state as it determines the success rate of the annealing process @xcite , especially in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . to compute the energy gap , precise calculation of the energies of the lowest two energy levels",
    "is necessary . earlier mean field approaches are no longer sufficient since they give only the ground - state energy , and even that is strictly speaking only correct in the thermodynamic limit . furthermore",
    ", the first excited state arises from the excitation of just a few spins and is very close in energy to the ground - state .",
    "the energy gap is therefore very small compared to the ground - state energy and is not an extensive quantity .",
    "one usually resorts to numerical methods when computing the energy gap in quantum spin - glasses @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "one is frequently interested in the behavior of the energy gap when the number of spins is large , and in this respect the most important difficulty faced in the numerical study of quantum spin - glasses is the apparent lack of conserved quantities , i.e. operators that commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "this is in stark contrast to , for instance , a non - disordered spin system @xcite such as the infinite range ferromagnetic ising model in transverse field @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the @xmath4-direction pauli matrix of the @xmath5th spin , @xmath6 is the total number of spins , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the strengths of the ferromagnetic coupling and transverse field . for @xmath9 , the total angular momentum @xmath10 is a conserved quantity and the hamiltonian matrix takes a block diagonal form . in particular , the ground and first excited states lie in the block with the largest total angular momentum , and it is possible to diagonalize this block matrix for large @xmath6 because its dimension scales only linearly with @xmath6 . fig .",
    "[ fig.fig00 ] shows the energy gap of @xmath9 computed in this way for @xmath11 , and 2000 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath12 is no longer conserved for quantum spin - glasses , and one must work with the full hilbert space whose dimension scales exponentially with @xmath6 .",
    "there are currently three main approaches for computing the low - lying energy levels of quantum spin - glasses .",
    "the first is to diagonalize the full hamiltonian matrix using standard numerical routines such as jacobi s method or householder reduction @xcite .",
    "all energy levels are obtained , but the size of the matrices and computational time involved mean that this approach is practical only for relatively small systems ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the second method is lanczos algorithm @xcite .",
    "this is an algorithm where only the lowest few eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed .",
    "the elements of the hamiltonian matrix need not be stored but can be computed only when needed . using lanczos algorithm ,",
    "some studies computed the energy gap @xcite as well as physical quantities such as the binder cumulant@xcite for up to @xmath14 , but further increase in @xmath6 is hampered by the exponential increase in the dimension of the eigenvectors .",
    "the third approach is quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite . unlike the previous methods , instead of including all the terms in hilbert space , one instead performs a sampling of the states of an effective classical model in imaginary time @xcite . by combining a novel zero - temperature qmc with a quantum annealing schedule ,",
    "das and chakrabarti computed the exact ground - state of quantum spin - glasses for up to @xmath15 with a numerical accuracy on par with that of lanczos algorithm@xcite . with the traditional qmc , young et al .",
    "are able to study systems with up to 256 spins @xcite .    in lanczos algorithm and qmc ,",
    "one seeks to obtain the energy levels exactly .",
    "the two methods can be viewed as opposite extremes , where the former includes all the terms in hilbert space while the latter seeks only a representative _ random _ sample . in this paper",
    ", we propose an intermediate between the two .",
    "we include only a subspace of the full hilbert space , but this subspace is constructed not randomly but systematically by including low - lying excitations from the ground - state . unlike the previous methods , our approach is not exact but an approximation",
    ". nevertheless , intuitively speaking , large excitations should make only minor corrections to the energies of the lowest few energy levels , and might be neglected if some approximation can be tolerated .",
    "the proposal to describe the system using a smaller basis consisting of low - lying excited states is well - grounded on the theoretical framework of hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation in many - body theory @xcite and configuration - interaction ( ci ) in quantum chemistry @xcite . in the hf formalism ,",
    "one considers a wavefunction consisting of a direct tensor product of single - spin states @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the state of the @xmath5th spin .",
    "early on , lipkin suggested using the hf wavefunction @xmath18 as an approximate ground - state wavefunction for the heisenberg and ising spin models with random bonds @xcite .",
    "more recently , dusuel and vidal also used @xmath18 in their study of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite , a non - disordered system .",
    "in particular , the analysis of dusuel and vidal showed that the energy obtained from @xmath18 gives just the extensive part of the ground - state energy .",
    "hence , hf approximation by itself is equivalent to mean field approximation .",
    "the reason is because the hf wavefunction is a direct product whereas the true ground - state can not be completely factorized . to improve upon the hf approximation , ci uses @xmath18 as a vacuum state for generating a basis of excited states .",
    "for instance , a basis state where spin 1 is excited is @xmath19 where @xmath20 arises from exciting spin 1 s ` ground - state ' @xmath21 , and the states of all the other spins remain the same .",
    "the ground - state wavefunction is then expanded in terms of a basis consisting of @xmath18 and such excited states .",
    "if all possible combinations of exciting all the spins are included the basis is complete and all physical quantities being calculated using ci are exact . in this paper",
    ", we make an approximation by including only the one - spin and two - spin excitations .",
    "as mentioned , hf approximation has previously been used by dusuel and vidal to study the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite . also , the combination of hf approximation and ci is already a standard technique in the field of quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "however , the two methods combined have not yet been applied to the study of quantum spin - glasses before .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform an extensive numerical study of a specific spin - glass model using a combination of the two methods . unlike previous approaches based on the full hilbert space , by focusing on a smaller subspace hf approximation and ci",
    "is computationally less expensive , making it possible to study system sizes comparable to that achievable by qmc .",
    "interestingly , even though the dimension of the subspace spanned by these low - lying excitations is very small relative to that of the full hilbert space , significant improvement in the accuracy of the energies of the levels is achieved by their inclusion .",
    "this means that much physical effects are captured by these excitations .",
    "hence , in addition to being an alternative technique for the numerical study of quantum spin - glasses , this approach also provides insights into the relative importance of different parts of hilbert space spanned by different excitations .    in this paper , we apply these methods to the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model in transverse field , @xmath22 @xmath23 is the strength of the transverse field , and the couplings @xmath24 are drawn from the gaussian distribution @xmath25 where @xmath26 measures the strength of the spin - glass term ( we set @xmath27 without loss of generality ) .",
    "several aspects of this model are already well - understood .",
    "for instance , its ground - state energy in the thermodynamic limit is known ( within the replica - symmetric ansatz ) @xcite .",
    "the absence of replica symmetry breaking in the presence of transverse field has been reported@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram has also been obtained using both mean field methods @xcite and qmc simulations @xcite .",
    "a recent numerical study of its critical behavior reveals the existence of two different universality classes ( classical and quantum ) , with a crossover at a finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the energy gap for small system sizes has also been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "however , the size dependent behavior of the model is still not very clear . in particular , at the point of quantum phase transition , one should observe that the energy gap of an infinite size system becomes zero @xcite .",
    "however , numerical studies of small system sizes ( @xmath28 ) show that the closure of the averaged energy gap does not coincide with the point of phase transition , leading to the proposition that the gap is not a useful quantity to describe phase transition in the sk model @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting claim but would require numerical evidences from larger system sizes to substantiate . with the approach proposed above , we study larger system sizes and chart the size dependence of the ground - state energy and energy gap .",
    "our results show that for large systems , the behavior of these quantities approaches that predicted by replica theory for an infinite system @xcite , and that gap closure is still a good description of phase transition in the sk model .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts . in the first part we study the ground - state energy in detail . for small system sizes ( from @xmath29 to 14 ) ,",
    "we compare the results of hf approximation and ci with the exact results computed using lanczos algorithm .",
    "this allows us to understand the error incurred by our approximations . for larger systems it is no longer possible to obtain the exact ground - state energy ,",
    "so we compare with the free energy computed using replica theory @xcite . a new insight offered by our method",
    "is the nature of the leading correction to the extensive part of the ground - state energy when the low - lying excitations are included .",
    "the scaling of the correction is ` sub - extensive ' in the sense that it varies as @xmath30 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the ferromagnetic model eq .",
    "( [ eq.i.01 ] ) whose leading correction is known from the holstein - primakoff transform to be independent of size @xcite .    in the second part",
    ", we study the energy gap in detail .",
    "traditionally , the energy gap is obtained by computing the second lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian matrix . here , we take a slightly novel approach by deriving a formula that relates the energy gap to the ground - state wavefunction .",
    "one does not need to solve the eigenvalue problem for the second lowest energy level , making it computationally less expensive .",
    "our gap formula is exact and independent of any approximation scheme .",
    "approximation enters by substituting the hf ( or ci ) instead of the exact ground - state wavefunction into the formula . for small system sizes ,",
    "we compare our approximation with the exact gap computed using lanczos algorithm .",
    "when applied to large systems , our method reveals that the energy gap of the sk model decreases as @xmath31 , much faster than @xmath32 for the ferromagnetic model .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows",

    "the scaling with system size of ( i ) the energy gap at the critical point and ( ii ) the leading correction to the extensive part of the ground - state energy are two new insights obtained with our approach .",
    "the dimension of the truncated ci basis scales as @xmath200 , much smaller than @xmath81 which is required for full diagonalization .",

    "[ fig.fig13 ] shows that the error incurred in the energy gap in the paramagnetic phase is actually very small .",

    "the usage is simpler compared to that of qmc , where usually one needs to first run a few trials to locate the critical point and also to estimate the number of monte carlo steps required to converge the data at different parameter values .",
    "moreover , near the critical point it can be computationally expensive to achieve numerical convergence for large system sizes using qmc@xcite .",
    "these issues do not arise in our proposed method .    in a spin - glass , especially in the thermodynamic limit , there exists many local minima whose energies are very close to each other , but are separated in configuration space by a macroscopic number of spin flips .",
    "the one - spin and two - spin flipped states provide a basis to expand the wavefunction centered around the global minimum . by truncating the ci expansion after the two - spin flipped states",
    ", we are effectively ignoring the other local minima ( and the states around them ) even though their energies can be very close to that of the global minimum .",
    "this truncation is a valid approximation when the transverse field is not too strong .",
    "when @xmath23 is turned on from zero , the ground - state wavefunction  a delta function located at the global minimum  starts to acquire a finite width .",
    "as the relaxation of this wavepacket is localized around the vicinity of the global minimum , there is almost no overlap with the wavefunctions at other local minima many spin - flips away .",
    "hence , truncated ci is sufficient to describe the ground - state during this initial stage .",
    "as @xmath23 increases further , however , the effects of tunneling becomes important .",
    "quantum fluctuations now enable the wavepacket at the global minimum to tunnel across energy barriers and superpose with the wavepackets at other local minima , giving rise to a ground - state that is delocalized in configuration space .",
    "in particular , as @xmath23 approaches criticality , it becomes necessary to include states with multiple spin - flips , and truncated ci is no longer accurate .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig.fig07 ] shows that the error incurred in the ground - state energy goes to zero in the classical limit ( @xmath201 ) and peaks around @xmath202 where the system undergoes a change of phase .",
    "hence , an interesting challenge in the numerical simulation of quantum spin - glasses would be the development of a technique that caters just specifically to the regime near criticality .",

    "[ fig.fig11 ] raises some interesting questions for the quantum annealing of the sk model . as system size increases the gap decreases to zero in the entire ordered phase , and this might be a problem for quantum annealing within the ordered phase .",
    "hitherto , analyses on the feasibility of quantum annealing have focused on the vanishing of the energy gap at the critical point .",
    "implicit in the landau - zener analysis of the avoided crossing is the assumption that the two energy levels become well - separated after the crossing .",
    "this might not be a valid assumption for the sk model in the thermodynamic limit . hence , even though the gap at the critical point of a continuous transition model does not decrease exponentially with system size , the feasibility of quantum annealing even for such models might be affected by the nature of the gap within the ordered phase . indeed , such a caveat has also been briefly mentioned in a recent letter by liu et al .",
