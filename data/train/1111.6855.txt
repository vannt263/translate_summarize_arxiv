    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the high and low state spectra are shown in fig .",

    "it can be seen that the 2006 spectrum shows much better resolved absorption troughs and was used in order to obtain the warm absorber parameters .",
    "the fitting procedure follows our ion - by - ion fitting method @xcite .",
    "first , we fit for the broad - band continuum .",
    "subsequently , we fit the absorption features using template ionic spectra that include all of the absorption lines and photoelectric edges of each ion , but vary with the broadening ( so - called turbulent ) velocity and the ionic column density . covering factor of unity",
    "is used throughout this process .",
    "the `` black '' troughs of the leading lines of o@xmath17 and o@xmath18 strongly support this assumption .",
    "strong emission lines are fitted as well .",
    "the emission lines are added after the absorption components were modelled ( hence , the emission lines are not absorbed ) .",
    "another interesting feature that can be seen in fig  [ spectra_01,06 ] is the softening of the spectrum at higher flux levels .",
    "this was already observed for ngc 3783 @xcite and in fact expected from the cooling of a comptonizing corona above the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the continuum x - ray  spectrum of most agns can be characterized by a high - energy power - law and a soft excess that rises above the power - law below @xmath101  kev .",
    "this soft excess is often modeled with a blackbody , or modified blackbody , although it clearly is more spectrally complex and possibly includes atomic features .",
    "for the 2006 spectra , we used a power law with a photon spectral index of @xmath19 = 1.48 , which was fitted to the 26   band , and a blackbody temperature of @xmath20 = 110 ev .",
    "this is a rather flat slope , which could be due to the band in which it is fitted , but it still provides an good fit to the spectrum ( see fig .  [ ngcfit ] ) .",
    "the intensity spectrum @xmath21 around an atomic absorption line @xmath22 can be expressed as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 represents the unabsorbed continuum intensity , @xmath25 denotes the line absorption cross section for photo - excitation ( in @xmath26 ) from ground level @xmath27 to excited level @xmath28 .",
    "if all ions are essentially in the ground level , @xmath29 is the total ionic column density towards the source ( in @xmath5 ) .",

    "the absorption oscillator strength is denoted by @xmath34 , and @xmath35 represents the voigt profile due to the convolution of natural ( lorentzian ) and doppler ( gaussian ) line broadening .",
    "the doppler broadening consists of thermal and turbulent motion , but in agn  outflows , the turbulent broadening is believed to dominate the temperature broadening . the natural broadening becomes important when the lines saturate as in our current spectrum , e.g. , the o@xmath17 line .",
    "transition wavelengths , natural widths and oscillator strengths were calculated using the hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac , * ? ? ? * ) . particularly important for agnoutflows",
    "are the inner - shell absorption lines @xcite .",
    "more recent and improved atomic data for the fe m - shell ions were incorporated from @xcite .",
    "these atomic wavelengths were tested against the hetg spectra of ngc3783 @xcite and found to agree with the data to within the instrumental precision .",
    "since the absorbing gas is outflowing , the absorption lines are slightly blue - shifted with respect to the agn  rest frame .",
    "although blue shifts of individual lines can differ to a small degree , we can identify two kinematic components with best - fit outflow velocities of @xmath36  km  s@xmath1 and @xmath37  km  s@xmath1  which we call component 1 and component 2 , respectively .",
    "we also identify two high ionization components at @xmath38  km  s@xmath1  and @xmath39  km  s@xmath1  ( component 3 and component 4 , respectively ) .",

    "component 4 is even harder to detect .",
    "there are signs for it either as a small `` knee '' or very small troughs .",
    "the broad k@xmath9 troughs of fe@xmath48 and fe@xmath49 , not shown in figure  [ velocity1 ] , also extend from @xmath10 04000 km  s@xmath1 . however",
    ", this result can not be too meaningful , as the instrumental resolution at these lines is worse than 3000 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "fe@xmath40 does not show absorption from the faster components 3 and 4 , and we conclude these two components appear only in higher ionization states . above @xmath50  ",
    "there are absorption lines mostly from oxygen which appear to have a high velocity component matching the third component ( @xmath51  km  s@xmath1 ) , but could also be local ( z=0 ) , which is discussed in detail in  [ local ] .    for all of the four components , a doppler turbulent velocity @xmath52  km  s@xmath1 , referred to by some as @xmath53fwhm@xmath54 $ ] is used ( i.e. , full width half maximum fwhm  = 500  km  s@xmath1 ) , which is approximately the meg broadening ( 23 m ) at 14 .",
    "this value provides a good fit to the strongest absorption lines in the spectrum .",
    "finally , the model includes also the 23  m  fwhm  instrumental broadening ( convolved with the model ) , the value of @xmath55  = 300  km  s@xmath1  is the same value used by @xcite for the slow component .",

    "we also include the k - shell photoelectric edges for all these ions although their effect here is largely negligible . when fitting the data , each ionic column density is treated as a free parameter .",
    "a preliminary spectral model is obtained using a monte - carlo fit applied to the entire spectrum .",
    "subsequently , the final fit is obtained for individual ionic column densities in a more controlled manner , which ensures that the fit of the leading lines is not compromised .",
    "ionic column density uncertainties are calculated by varying each column density ( while the other ions are fixed ) until @xmath65 , as described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the best fit model is plotted over the data in fig .",
    "[ ngcfit ] .",
    "it can be seen that most ions are reproduced fairly well by the model .",
    "note that some lines could be saturated , e.g. , the leading lines of o@xmath17 and o@xmath18 . in these cases , the higher order lines with lower oscillator strengths are crucial for obtaining reliable @xmath29 values .",
    "the large range of ionization states present in the absorber implies that the absorption arises from gas that is distributed over a wide range of ionization parameter @xmath13 . throughout this work , we use the following convention for the ionization parameter @xmath66 in units of erg  s@xmath1  cm , where @xmath67 is the ionizing luminosity , @xmath68 is the h number density , and @xmath69 is the distance from the ionizing source .",
    "we apply the absorption measure distribution ( @xmath3 ) analysis in order to obtain the total hydrogen column density @xmath15 along the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath3 can be expressed as :    @xmath70    and    @xmath71    the relation between the ionic column densities @xmath29 and the @xmath3 is then expressed as :    @xmath72    where @xmath29 is the measured ion column density , @xmath73 is the element abundance with respect to hydrogen assumed to be constant throughout the absorber , and @xmath74 is the fractional ion abundance with respect to the total abundance of its element .",
    "we aim at recovering the @xmath3 for the different kinematic components of ngc  3516 .    for the @xmath3",
    ", we seek a distribution @xmath75 that after integration ( eq .  [ eqamd ] ) will produce all of the measured ionic column densities . in this procedure",
    ", one must take into account the full dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath13 .",
    "we employ the xstar  code @xcite version 2.1kn3 to calculate @xmath74 using the continuum derived in  [ sec : continuum ] , and extrapolated to the range of 1  1000 rydberg . during the fit ,",
    "the @xmath3 bin values are the only parameters left free to vary .",
    "the @xmath3 errors are calculated by varying each bin from its best - fit value while the whole distribution is refitted .",
    "this procedure is repeated until @xmath77 .",
    "the fact that changes in the @xmath3 in one bin can be compensated by varying the @xmath3 in other bins dominates the @xmath3 uncertainties .",
    "this is what limits the number of bins and the @xmath3 resolution in @xmath13 or @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , we choose the narrowest bins ( in @xmath79 ) that still give meaningful errors . @xmath3 in neighboring , excessively narrow bins can not be distinguished by the data , i.e. , different narrow - bin distributions produce the measured @xmath29 values to within the errors .",
    "more details on the @xmath3 binning method and error calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the current method obtains a well defined distribution of ionization , which is tightly constrained by the data , instead of the more traditional method , which constructs a superposition of individual ionization components that are @xmath80 functions of @xmath13 , and are obtained through a global - fitting procedure .",
    "the current method should not be viewed as an upgraded version of the traditional one .",
    "in fact , the two approaches are fundamentally different . while the @xmath3 is a bottom - up approach that uses directly measured quantities @xmath81 to derive the distribution , global fitting uses a top - bottom method that imposes a physical model and obtains its best - fit parameters .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath3 method is that it helps identify column - density and ionization trends that can then be compared with models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the precise temperature boundaries between different phases of the possibly multi - phase absorber , e.g. , due to thermally unstable temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is not intended to , and indeed does not necessarily provide a superior statistical fit to the spectra .",
    "the present ngc  3516  spectrum has a few narrow , bright emission lines .",
    "the emission component is added only after the continuum is set and the absorption fit is completed .",

    "the errors for the ionic column densities were calculated in the same manner as in @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that both component 1 and component 2 have a wide range of ionization parameter .",
    "they both have similar absorption with ionic column densities of the order of 10@xmath86 to 10@xmath87 @xmath5 in iron , silicon , neon , and magnesium , while those of the more abundant o ions are higher and reach @xmath10  10@xmath88  @xmath5 .",

    "it is mostly a manifestation of the relatively low ionic column densities observed for the ions fe@xmath46",
    "fe@xmath64 , as can be seen in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "one way to explain this gap is that this temperature regime is thermally unstable @xcite .",

    "such instabilities could result in a multi phase ( hot and cold ) plasma in pressure equilibrium , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the @xmath3s of component 1 and 2 are so similar , which implies the physical conditions in component 1 and component 2 , the distance from the source and the outflow density , as well as the overall outflow column are similar . given the similar @xmath3s we are led to think that these components are connected .",

    "on the other hand , the @xmath3 value of these component for @xmath95 @xmath96 2  ( erg  s@xmath1  cm ) is an order of magnitude higher than in components 1 and 2 . in the k - shell",

    "similarly to components 1 and 2 , we are led to think that component 3 and 4 are also connected ; particularly , since they both appear in the 2006 spectrum , but are absent in the 2001 spectrum , together ( see  [ variability ] ) . the total column density ( integrated @xmath3 )",

    "table 5 shows that the total column density can vary between observations and authors by nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "the highest column densities are due to few spectral features e.g. , fe - k in the present work , or to the need to explain spectral curvature with photo - electric absorption without lines @xcite .",

    "the outflow velocity of component 3 is 2600@xmath0200 km  s@xmath1  matching the cosmological recession of 2650 km  s@xmath1 , which raises the possibility that some of the absorption at this velocity is due to local absorption as commonly found along lines of sight to bright agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are a few additional reasons to favor the local component scenario for o and n. first , they form at lower ionization parameters of @xmath105 , while most of component 3 is primarily comprised of high ionization species . in fe , we do not detect any m - shell ions , and not even fe@xmath40 in this component . even though we can not conclusively determine whether the oxygen and nitrogen absorption comes from outflow component 3 , or has a local origin , we tend to favor the local origin scenario , because such a component is often observed .",
    "the ( presumably ) local component column densities are shown in table  [ tab : local ] .",
    "the low charge states are due to the galactic disc and halo , and likely not associated with the higher ionization states that are due to the hot phase of the galactic halo or the local group .",
    "the oxygen ionic column densities are all in the range of several 10@xmath86 @xmath5 , which implies a neutral hydrogen column density of a few 10@xmath106 @xmath5 , using 4.9@xmath10710@xmath108 for the o to h ratio @xcite and a fractional ionic abundance of 0.5 .",
    "this value is consistent with the galactic absorption of @xmath15 = 3.23@xmath16 @xmath5@xcite .",
    "using the same calculations for n@xmath17 gives a slightly higher neutral hydrogen column density of the order of @xmath1010@xmath109 @xmath5 .",
    "note that most species of component 3 are likely not local since their ionization and column densities are too high .",
    "ions such as fe@xmath110 , k - shell s and si , ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) are usually not observed in the local ionized ism .",
    "moreover , the high column density measured in this component of n@xmath111 @xmath5  is by far higher than typical local ism columns .",
    "the observation of 2006 caught ngc  3516  in a much higher state than the 2001 observation , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spectra_01,06 ] .",
    "so far , the analysis in this paper focused on the 2006 observation .",
    "we now want to use the two flux states to study the differences between the two .",
    "several explanations for the flux and spectral variability of ngc  3516  can be found in the literature .",
    "@xcite reported a slow , monotonic decay in flux between 1994 and 2000 , however _",
    "bepposa@xmath12x _  observations from 1996 and 1997 as well as the present data show a sharp transition between high and low flux over a period of 4 months ( see table .  [ cont ] ) .",
    "@xcite used a varying covering factor .",
    "however , @xcite found that a varying covering factor did not fit the data , while , variable source continuum could .",
    "in order to compare the absorption in 2001 and in 2006 we scaled up the 2001 spectrum to the flux level of 2006 near specific lines . since absorption depends exponentially on optical depth , this comparison directly shows changes in optical depth , independent of continuum flux .",
    "if the absorber did not change , the scaled - up trough should match that of the high - state .",
    "because the continuum shape during the two states is different , this comparison is meaningful only locally .",
    "indeed , we show this comparison around the most prominent lines . results for si and mg k @xmath9 lines , and for fe@xmath43 and fe@xmath42 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio1 ] , where the low stat spectrum is multiplied by 4 in the upper left panel , by 4.5 in the upper right panel , by 4.3 in the lower left panel , and by 5.2 in the lower right panel .",
    "the s / n in the low - state is worse , but it appears that component 1 ( the slowest component ) did not change much between the high and low states . on the other hand ,",
    "some of component 2 and most of components 3 and 4 are absent in the 2001 low state . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss a possible geometrical explanation for this result .",
    "we find that apart from a lower continuum level , the 2001 spectrum of ngc  3516  also lacks the faster absorption components .",
    "the appearance of high - ionization ( @xmath112 erg  s@xmath1  cm ) components with columns of @xmath113 @xmath5 are reminiscent of the variable covering invoked by @xcite to explain the varying continuum shape .",
    "we allude to three other possible explanations :    a.*photo - ionization change * - the faster components of the outflow are also more ionized .",
    "one possibility could be that the fast components recombined due to the reduced flux , and are thus not seen in 2001 .",
    "however , one would still expect to observe the fast components in lower charge states .",
    "we could not detect the fast components in the 2001 spectrum in any ion .",
    "since the 2001 spectrum has a much lower signal to noise ratio , we can not unambiguously rule out this possibility .",
    "b.*fast components crossing line of sight * - another possibility could be that the fast components , while not in the line of sight in 2001 , passed through our line of sight in 2006 , 5 years are plenty of time compared to the variability time scale of months that perhaps represents the size of the source , to make this scenario work .",
    "such transverse velocities have been proposed for ngc 4151 by @xcite .",
    "c.*lighting up the disc * the third possibility is that the fast components are present the whole time , but in 2001 , when the flux is low , there was no light from accretion disk behind them for them to absorb . in 2006 ,",
    "the source flux is much brighter , whether intrinsic source output change or flux change due to variable covering factor by thick gas , which could result from a flare on the disc that illuminates the fast components from behind , and which subsequently they absorb along the line of sight .    with the current spectra",
    ", one can not rule out any of these scenarios .",
    "with better s / n spectra , one might be able to confirm ( or rule out ) changes in the ( photo-)ionization state if the fast component is detected ( or not detected ) in low ionization species during the low flux state .",
    "if one would detect a change in the covering fraction in the narrow absorption lines , which we are not able to detect here , that would be evidence for transverse velocities @xcite .",
    "the possibility of flaring on the disc is most difficult to test , as the angular resolution required for detecting sources on sub - disc scales is currently prohibitive .",
    "we have analyzed the kinematic and thermal structure of the ionized outflow in ngc  3516 .",
    "we find absorption troughs in dozens of charge states that extend from zero to almost 5000 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we model the outflow with four absorption systems .",
    "the first and second components are outflowing at 350 and 1500  km  s@xmath1 , and span a considerable range of ionization from at least fe@xmath56 to fe@xmath43 [ @xmath114 ( erg  s@xmath1  cm ) ] .",
    "the third and fourth components are outflowing at 2600 and 4000  km  s@xmath1 , respectively and are highly ionized featuring only l - shell and k - shell iron and k - shell ions from lighter elements .",
    "finally , a component of local absorption at @xmath2 ( 2630 km  s@xmath1 ) is detected , this component could be part of the third component , however its low ionization and narrow time profiles imply it is more likely at @xmath2 .    using our @xmath3 reconstruction method for all four components",
    ", we measured the distribution of column density as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "we find a double - peaked distribution with a significant minimum at @xmath115 ( erg  s@xmath1  cm ) in components 1 and 2 , which corresponds to temperatures of @xmath93 ( k ) .",
    "this minimum was observed in other agn  outflows like mcg  63015 , ngc3783 , iras 13349 + 2438 , ngc7469 , and it can be ascribed to thermal instability that appear to exist ubiquitously in photo - ionized seyfert winds .",
    "the @xmath3 of component 3 shows a continuous rise in column density toward higher ionization parameters .",
    "the @xmath3 of component 4 is similar in some aspects to that of component 3 , however it shows a minima at @xmath116 ( k ) mostly due to low fe@xmath98fe@xmath99 column densities .",
    "the local absorption system could arise from either the ionized galactic ism , or from the local group .",

    "<S> by analyzing the x - ray  spectra of ngc  3516  from 2001 and from 2006 obtained with the hetgs  spectrometer on board the _ chandra _  observatory , we find that the kinematic structure of the outflow can be well represented by four outflow components intrinsic to ngc  3516 : 350  @xmath0 100  km  s@xmath1 , 1500  @xmath0 150  km  s@xmath1 , 2600  @xmath0 200  km  s@xmath1 , and 4000  @xmath0 400  km  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a local component at @xmath2 could be confused in the spectrum with intrinsic component 3 . </S>",
    "<S> components 1 and 2 have a broad range of ionization manifested by absorption from 23 different charge states of fe . component 3 and 4 are more highly ionized and show absorption from only 9 different charge states of fe . </S>",
    "<S> however , we were able to reconstruct the absorption measure distribution ( @xmath3 ) for all four . </S>",
    "<S> the total column density of each component is @xmath4  @xmath5 , @xmath6  @xmath5 , @xmath7  @xmath5 , and @xmath8  @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fast components 3 and 4 appear only in the high state of 2006 and not in 2001 , while the slower components persist during both epochs . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there is no significant absorption variability within days during 2001 or during 2006 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that covering factor plays a minor role for the line absorption .    </S>",
