    "hot intracluster gas should have an admixture of non - thermal components , including relativistic electrons , magnetic fields , relativistic protons , and supra - thermal electrons .",
    "some of these components are expected on the theoretical grounds while the presence of relativistic electrons and sizable magnetic fields is clear from observations of cluster radio halos ( see e.g. , a recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "often , the very existence of non - thermal components in the icm poses interesting problems which have been studied intensively ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "the relativistic electron population in clusters can be studied in the hard x - ray band through the high - energy spectral components observed on top of the thermal bremsstrahlung spectra .",
    "if such components are present at the intensity levels accessible with the current instrumentation , their likely origin is inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons ; the models in which high - energy x - rays are produced by bremsstrahlung of the supra - thermal electrons are less attractive ( e.g. , petrosian , 2001 ; petrosian , bykov & rephaeli , 2008 ; petrosian & eats , 2008 ) because subrelativistic electrons are subject to strong coulomb losses ( but see @xcite ) . at some level ,",
    "an excess around 2030  kev with respect to a single - temperature fit can be attributed to the presence of localized patches of hot gas with temperatures substantially exceeding the cluster average .",
    "the amplitude and the shape of such high energy excess is an important diagnostic for the non - isothermality of the gas .",
    "a classic application of the hard x - ray spectral observations is the measurement of the bulk magnetic field strength via comparison of the inverse compton and radio synchrotron emission ( e.g. , felten & morrison 1966 , tucker et al . , 1973 , rephaeli 1979 ) .",
    "a prime object for such studies is the coma cluster , which possesses a bright , well - studied radio halo ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since coma is also the nearest rich cluster , it was observed with virtually every x - ray observatory flown .",
    "detection of the hard x - ray component in excess over the extrapolation of the thermal spectrum in coma was first reported from the _ rxte _ and _ beppo - sax _",
    "observations @xcite , later confirmed by more extensive analyses @xcite",
    ". the statistical significance of these detections remains not very high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* reported a @xmath10 detection ) , and the reported detections are subject to criticism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* report only a @xmath11 significance of the hard component from independent reanalysis of the data ) .",
    "even if a hard component exists in the coma spectrum , we can not exclude , on the basis of the _ beppo - sax _ of _ rxte _ data , a possibility that it is produced by , e.g. , a strongly absorbed agn .",
    "obviously , the situation can be improved through observations of coma with an _ imaging _ hard x - ray telescope .",
    "telescopes of the _ integral _ observatory @xcite offer a unique combination of good sensitivity and angular resolution in hard x - rays . the total _",
    "integral _ exposure of the coma cluster is almost @xmath12  sec , leading to the sensitivity for an extended source at @xmath13  kev which is comparable to that of the _ beppo - sax _ and _ rxte _ data .",
    "coma is detected by _",
    "integral _ with high significance at @xmath14  kev , where the emission is dominated by the thermal component ; the analysis in this energy band has been reported by @xcite and @xcite ; @xcite also used the first 500  ksec of the coma data to put limits on the hard x - ray component . in this work",
    ", we present a systematic analysis of the hard x - ray component using the full _ integral _ exposure in combination with the data from _ rosat _ and _ rxte_. the combination of the data from these satellites provides an accurate , self - consistent measurement of the broad band thermal spectrum of coma , which is critical for detection of non - thermal components at or below 50  kev .",
    "we also present a temperature map of the central region of coma obtained from the ratio of _ integral _ and _ rosat _ brightnesses .",
    "all distance - dependent quantities are reported assuming that coma is at @xmath15  mpc ( corresponding to @xmath16 and @xmath17 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ) .",
    "we use x - ray observations of the coma cluster performed by _ rosat _ , _ rxte _ , and _",
    "integral_. these observatories combined cover a very broad energy range , 0.5100  kev , and thus provide a very high - quality broad band spectrum . since coma is a bright x - ray source , the spectral measurements with each instrument are relatively straightforward .",
    "the main complication is adjusting the observed spectra to account for the different spatial response : _ rosat _ is a direct - imaging telescope ; _ integral _ is a coded - mask imager which results in a rather broad point spread function ( psf ) in reconstructed images ; _ rxte _ is a collimator with a beam pattern which is slightly smaller than the cluster size .",
    "also , the statistical quality of the coma data in the _ rosat _ and _ rxte _ energy bands is very high and so uncertainties are dominated by the instrument cross - calibration .",
    "these issues are discussed below for each telescope individually .",
    "coma was targeted by _",
    "integral _ in several sets of observations with a total exposure near @xmath18  seconds ( revolutions 36 , 71 , 72 , 274 , 275 , 317 , 318 , 319 , 324 , 325 ) .",
    "we concentrated here on the data from isgri detector @xcite of the ibis telescope @xcite .",
    "this telescope provides a wide field of view ( @xmath19 ) and an angular resolution of 12 .",
    "the telescope is sensitive over approximately @xmath20  kev energy band .",
    "some fraction of the ibis data was affected by solar flares and was discarded from the analysis .",
    "the clean set of ibis data was initially reduced in individual pointings ( so called science windows ) , each with a typical duration @xmath21  ksec .",
    "the reconstructed images were combined into a single mosaic which was analyzed further .",
    "the total dead - time corrected combined exposure was @xmath22 ksec .",
    "the ibis / isgri image reconstruction algorithm was discussed previously in @xcite , and we refer the reader to these works . a crucial prerequisite for this  and any other coded mask image reconstruction algorithm  is the ability to accurately predict the detector background image in the absence of any sources .",
    "our image reconstruction software uses standard calibration tables ( osa 6.0 ) were used to correct the event energies depending of their rise - time .",

    "the solid line shows a growth curve expected for a @xmath23-model profile with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( parameters for the @xmath23-model in the _ rosat _ band ) .",
    "the crab flux was rescaled to the coma level for comparison . ]",
    "angular size of the coma cluster is significantly larger than the ibis psf .",
    "this is apparent from the comparison of the `` growth function '' ( flux integrated within an aperture ) for coma and a point source ( crab ) shown in fig.[growth ] .",
    "while essentially all of crab flux is concentrated within 12 ( three 4 pixels in the reconstructed image ) , for coma the curve continues to grow up to a 30 radius .",
    "in fact , the observed growth curve is consistent with that for a @xmath23-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) fit to the _ rosat _ image , @xmath26 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . because of such a good agreement",
    ", the total coma flux in the _ integral _ energy bands can be obtained by fitting a normalization of the @xmath23-model instead of directly integrating the flux in each pixel within a wide aperture .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it provides a higher statistical accuracy since each pixel is added with an optimal weight .",
    "direct integration , however , is less model - dependent since the hard - band thermal  and especially , the inverse compton  emission in general does not have to follow the distribution of the surface brightness in the _ rosat _ band . given the pros and cons , our choice is to use the @xmath23-model fluxes throughout but always check that they are consistent with the direct integration .",
    "the limiting factor for the _ integral _ observations of the coma cluster is the level of background fluctuations .",
    "in addition to purely statistical fluctuations , the background can leave systematic variations in the reconstructed image if subtracted incompletely from the raw detector image .",
    "every care was taken , therefore , to ensure that the background was subtracted correctly .",
    "background templates were taken from observations of `` empty '' fields closest in time to each coma pointing or group of pointings . with this approach",
    ", we correctly take into account all possible temporal variations of isgri background . as a final check",
    ", we checked the statistics of fluctuations in the reconstructed image ( similar to the analysis in  3 of @xcite ) , and also fluxes within 40 circles at different off - axis locations . in both cases ,",
    "the variations had the mean consistent with zero and the dispersion equal to that expected for the purely poisson fluctuations .",
    "we conclude , that the accuracy of our background modeling has reached its fundamental statistical limit ( for the exposure time accumulated during coma observations ) .    to convert isgri counts to physical flux units ( erg  s@xmath7  @xmath6 ) , we used the calibration observations of the crab nebula which are regularly performing by _ integral_. crab observations were reduced with the same software setup we used for coma and the counts - to - flux conversion coefficients were determined assuming the `` conventional '' spectral parameters for crab , @xmath27   phot  s@xmath7  @xmath6  kev@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "after experimenting with energy bands for the coma analysis , we chose to extract fluxes in the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath3  kev bands .",
    "isgri efficiency quickly drops below 17  kev setting a natural lower limit for the energy band .",
    "the width of the two lower channels , factor of 1.3 in energy , was chosen to ensure high statistical significance of the coma detection ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the flux in the @xmath3  kev channel should be dominated by non - thermal components .",
    "the third channel , @xmath30  kev fills the gap .",
    "source fluxes were extracted within the 60  radius .",
    "this aperture , one the one hand , contains almost all of the _ integral _ x - ray flux ( fig.[growth ] ) , and on the other hand matches the size of the _ rxte _ field of view , making flux comparisons easier .",
    "_ rosat _ pointings fully cover this region .",
    "upper limit for a point source emission is shown by a dashed - dotted line . ]",
    "coma was observed by _ rxte _ for @xmath32  ksec ( obs.id 10368 ) and the data from its pca spectrometer can be used to measure the cluster spectrum in the @xmath33 kev energy band .",
    "the data reduction was done with standard programs of the lheasoft package ( v6.0 ) . to increase the sensitivity and reduce systematic uncertainties",
    ", we used only data of the first layers of pca detectors .",
    "the background was based on the `` l7_240 cm '' model ( this includes both the particle - induced detector background and the all - sky average of the cosmic x - ray background ) .",
    "one of the complications in the _ rxte _ analysis is to correctly compute the flux fraction outside the pca collimator fov .",
    "the pca beam pattern can be modeled as a convolution of a near - conical response of the individual collimator , @xmath34 , with a gaussian ( @xmath35 ) which corresponds to misalignment of individual collimators and spacecraft pointing drift during the observation @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 is tabulated in the calibration file _",
    "pcacol_. assuming that in the pca energy band , the coma surface brightness distribution follows the _ rosat _ image , the effective flux fraction within the pca fov can be computed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the _ rosat _ image and @xmath38 is a gaussian .",
    "to obtain total coma fluxes , the observed _ rxte _ count rates should be divided by this factor .",
    "in addition to the fov correction , we need to ensure good cross - calibration of the _ rxte_/pca with _",
    "rosat _ and _ integral_. to this end , we note that the best - fit parameters of the crab spectrum obtained with the standard pca response matrix differ significantly from the `` conventional '' values : @xmath39 and @xmath40 phot s@xmath7 @xmath6 kev@xmath7 instead of 2.1 and 9.7 phot s@xmath7 @xmath6 kev@xmath7 , respectively , indicating a possible problem with the pca absolute calibration @xcite .",
    "an ad - hoc correction factor , @xmath41 applied to the observed pca spectra brings the crab results into agreement with the conventional average spectrum @xcite .",
    "we apply this correction factor also to the coma data .",
    "we note that this eliminates a 20% difference in flux when the pca spectrum is extrapolated to the _ rosat _ band ; the _ integral _ and pca fluxes near 20  kev are also in a good agreement after this correction is applied ( fig.[spectrum ] ) .",
    "since we effectively base the pca response calibration on the absolute crab spectrum , we need to assign systematic errors to account for the uncertainties in the latter .",
    "the uncertainty of the crab spectral index , @xmath42 @xcite can be approximated if we bin the pca data into five wide energy channels and assign a 7% uncertainty to the flux in each channel .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc pointed observations of coma were reduced as described in @xcite .",
    "the reduction pipeline was based on s.  snowden s software @xcite .",
    "this software eliminates periods of high particle and scattered solar backgrounds as well as those intervals when the detector may be unstable .",
    "exposure maps in several energy bands are then created using detector maps obtained during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey .",
    "the exposure maps include vignetting and all detector artifacts . the unvignetted particle background is estimated and subtracted from the data even though the pspc particle background is low compared to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "the scattered solar x - ray background also should be subtracted separately , because , depending on the viewing angle , it can introduce a constant background gradient across the image .",
    "most of solar x - rays were eliminated by simply excluding time intervals when this emission was high , but the remaining contribution was also modeled and subtracted .",
    "the remaining background was estimated by extracting the radial surface brightness profile from the merged data , and fitting it to the @xmath43 model at large radii .",
    "the background - subtracted images are suitable for direct extraction of fluxes in the energy bands of interest .",
    "our imaging analysis uses the 0.52  kev band images .",
    "the combined energy spectrum of coma from _ integral _ ( @xmath44  kev ) , _ rxte _ ( @xmath33  kev ) , and _ rosat _ ( @xmath45  kev ) is shown in fig.[spectrum ]",

    "we did not adjust the normalization of the _ beppo - sax _ spectrum to account for the cluster flux outside the collimator fov .",
    "note the overall mismatch in spectral slope between our _ rxte _ and _ integral _ measurements in the 1550  kev energy band .",
    "this has implications for the decomposition of the observed data into thermal and non - thermal components . ]",
    "_ integral _ fluxes at @xmath56  kev are in full agreement with the thermal spectrum . the thermal component ( including possible contribution from hotter regions within the cluster , see below ) should make a negligible contribution at higher energies .",

    "measurements @xcite .",
    "we also tried to repeat the @xcite procedure by fixing the photon index of a non - thermal component at @xmath59 and fitting the total spectrum with a thermal plus power law model .",

    "the source of discrepancy seems to be instead in the fluxes measured at the lower boundary of the _ beppo - sax _ band .",
    "the _ beppo - sax _ data points below 20 kev seem to be a factor of 1.52 below our _ rxte _ and _ integral _ measurements , and hence they imply a lower thermal component flux .",
    "these discrepancies underscore the importance of using a broad - band spectra for detection of non - thermal components from hot clusters at around @xmath62  kev .    where _ integral _ can do significantly better than the previous observatories is to check whether this emission can be attributed to single point source within the cluster .",
    "we do not detect any significant point sources in the hard - band image ( see below ) and a @xmath63 upper limit on the point source flux is @xmath64  ergs  @xmath6  s@xmath7 in the 44107  kev band .",
    "this is below the fluxes of non - thermal components reported by @xcite and @xcite , and so we can exclude a possibility that these detections can be attributed to a single persistent agn .      to study the spatial structure of the cluster emission , we used images in the @xmath65  kev ( `` soft '' ) and @xmath3  kev ( `` hard '' ) _ integral _ bands .",

    "we estimate the effects of magnetic field variations using a simple parameterization , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the thermal gas density , which scales approximately as the icm pressure if the gas density variations are much stronger than those of temperature over the region of interest . adopting the _ rosat _ @xmath23-model for the gas density distribution , we can write : @xmath124^{-\\frac{3}{4}a\\beta_x},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the magnetic field at the center of the cluster . in this parameterization @xmath125",
    "corresponds to the case of a constant magnetic field , while @xmath118 implies that energy density of the magnetic field scales as the icm pressure .",
    "compared to the constant @xmath84 case ( i.e. eq.[eq : fx ] ) the ratio of the ic and synchrotron fluxes ( within given distance from the center ) has to be multiplied by an additional factor @xmath126 : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is given by eq.[eq : emr ] where the integration is in the range @xmath129 .",
    "the computed factor @xmath126 is shown in fig.[fig : comar ] ( in these calculations we assumed the x - ray surface brightness parameters @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) .",
    "the total ic flux ( up to infinity ) may actually diverge for large @xmath132 since the drop of the @xmath84 at large distances from the center has to be `` compensated '' by energy density of relativistic particles to maintain the assumed @xmath133 .",
    "this causes strong increase of ic emission .",
    "formally for convergence ( up to infinity ) one needs : @xmath134 which translates to @xmath135 for our parameters .",
    "however , since we integrate the hard x - ray flux only within a 1  radius , we can use wider range of @xmath132 .",
    "it follows from fig.[fig : comar ] that the change in @xmath132 from 0 to 1 changes the ratio @xmath126 by a factor of @xmath12111 .",
    "this translates into the uncertainty in the estimated @xmath119 by a factor of @xmath136 .",
    "an additional uncertainty is introduced by our determination of the hard x - ray flux which was done by convolution of the _ integral _ image with the surface brightness model observed at @xmath137  kev by _",
    "rosat_. if , for example , the true surface brightness in the hard band has the same core - radius but @xmath23 is varied in the range 0.3 - 1.5 , this would change our derived values of @xmath119 by @xmath13830% .",
    "although the modeling uncertainties described above are substantial , they do not change the conclusion that it is unlikely that the ic emission in the @xmath3 kev band can reach the flux levels comparable to the isgri/_integral _ sensitivity , unless the magnetic field is as low as a few@xmath139 .",
    "for these low values of the magnetic field the life time is shorter for electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron emission ( fig.[fig : comab ] ) and thus the ic spectrum of the electron population has to be close to a power law , as long as a power law spectrum is observed in the radio .",
    "if we treat the observed hard x - ray flux as a detection , the derived @xmath140  @xmath8 g is an order of magnitude below the values derived from faraday rotation @xmath141  @xmath8 g ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "various ways to bring these estimates into agreement have been discussed ( see e.g. goldshmidt & rephaeli 1993 , petrosian 2001 , brunetti et al . , 2001 , newman et al .",
    "the most obvious factor affecting these estimates is the spatial variations of the field strength .",
    "note that the faraday rotation signal depends on the line of sight integral of the product of the electron density and the parallel component of the field .",
    "the value of the field derived from the comparison of the cluster ic and radio fluxes depends instead on the volume averaged non - linear function of the field ( see eq.[eq : fa ] ) .",
    "thus different assumptions on the non - uniformity of the magnetic field will affect differently the estimates of @xmath84 with these two methods and the above mentioned discrepancy can be at least partly removed .",
    "however , given the low significance of the signal , we should treat the _",
    "integral _ results as an upper limit on the ic flux .",
    "our @xmath63 upper limit in the @xmath3 kev band is perfectly consistent with the magnetic fields stronger than few@xmath139 . for even larger fields , the expected ic signal drops as @xmath142 and",
    "will be below the reach of even planned future experiments .",
    "for example , for @xmath143 g , the expected ic flux at @xmath144  kev is a factor of @xmath145 below the _ integral _ sensitivity , even without account for any possible electron aging ( see fig.[fig : comab ] ) .",
    "the summary of main results from the deep observations of the _ coma _ cluster with _",
    "integral _ and combining these observations with results of _ rxte _ and rosat observatories lead us to the following conclusions :      \\2 ) there are significant temperature variations within the cluster and the mean 8.2  kev temperature is the result of mixing emission components with @xmath77 ranging from 7.5 to 10.5  kev .",
    "the temperature near the _ rosat _ surface brightness peak is @xmath147  kev .",
    "\\3 ) we do not detect a significant excess over the thermal spectrum at high energies .",
