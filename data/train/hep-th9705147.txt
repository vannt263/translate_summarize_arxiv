    "the possible loss of quantum coherence is one of the most exciting topics in quantum gravity .",
    "recent work on d - branes has encouraged those that believe that the evaporation of black holes is a unitary process without loss of quantum coherence . it has been shown that collections of strings attached to d - branes with the same mass and gauge charges as nearly extreme black holes have a number of internal states that is the same function of the mass and gauge charges as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the area of the horizon of the black hole @xcite .",
    "they also seem to radiate various types of scalar particles @xcite at the same rate as the corresponding black holes .",
    "however , the d - brane calculations are valid only for weak coupling , at which string loops can be neglected .",
    "but at these weak couplings , the d - branes are definitely not black holes : there are no horizons , and the topology of spacetime is that of flat space .",
    "one can foliate such a spacetime with a family of non - intersecting surfaces of constant time .",
    "one can then evolve forward in time with the hamiltonian and get a unitary transformation from the initial state to the final state .",
    "a unitary transformation would be a one to one mapping from the initial hilbert space to the final hilbert space .",
    "this would imply that there was no loss of information or quantum coherence .",
    "to get something that corresponds to a black hole , one has to increase the string coupling constant until it becomes strong .",
    "this means that string loops can no longer be neglected .",
    "however , it is argued that for gauge charges that correspond to extreme , or near extreme black holes , the number of internal states will be protected by non - renormalization theorems , and will remain the same .",
    "it is argued that there s no sign of a discontinuity as one increases the coupling , and therefore that the evolution should remain unitary .",
    "however , there s a very definite discontinuity when event horizons form : the euclidean topology of spacetime will change from that of flat space , to something non - trivial .",
    "the change in topology will mean that any vector field that agrees with time translations at infinity , will necessarily have zeroes in the interior of the spacetime . in turn",
    ", this will mean that one can not foliate spacetime with a family of time surfaces .",
    "if one tries , the surfaces will intersect at the zeroes of the vector field .",
    "one therefore can not use the hamiltonian to get a unitary evolution from an initial state to a final state .",
    "but if the evolution is not unitary , there will be loss of quantum coherence .",
    "an initial state that is a pure quantum state can evolve to a quantum state that is mixed .",
    "another way of saying this is that the superscattering operator that maps initial density matrices to final density matrices will not factorise into the product of an @xmath3 matrix and its adjoint @xcite .",
    "this will happen because the zeroes of the time translation vector field indicate that there will be horizons in the lorentzian section .",
    "quantum states on such a background are not completely determined by their asymptotic behavior , which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the superscattering operator to factorise .",
    "one can not just ignore topology and pretend one is in flat space .",
    "the recent progress in duality in gravitational theories is based on non - trivial topology .",
    "one considers small perturbations about different vacuums of the product form @xmath4 , and shows that one gets equivalent kaluza - klein theories .",
    "but if one can have small perturbations about product metrics , one should also consider larger fluctuations that change the topology from the product form . indeed ,",
    "such non - product topologies are necessary to describe pair creation or annihilation of solitons like black holes or p - branes .",
    "it is often claimed that supergravity is just a low energy approximation to the fundamental theory , which is string theory .",
    "however , the recent work on duality seems to be telling us that string theory , p - branes and supergravity are all on a similar footing . none of them is the whole picture ; instead , they are valid in different , but overlapping , regions . there may be some fundamental theory from which they can all be derived as different approximations .",
    "or it may be that theoretical physics is like a manifold that ca nt be covered by a single coordinate patch .",
    "instead , we may have to use a collection of apparently different theories that are valid in different regions , but which agree on the overlaps .",
    "after all , we know from goedel s theorem that even arithmetic ca nt be reduced to a single set of axioms",
    ". why should theoretical physics be different ?",
    "even if there is a single formulation of the underlying fundamental theory , we do nt have it yet .",
    "what is called string theory has a good loop expansion , but it is only perturbation theory about some background , generally flat space , so it will break down when the fluctuations become large enough to change the topology .",
    "supergravity , on the other hand , is better at dealing with topological fluctuations , but it will probably diverge at some high number of loops .",
    "such divergences do nt mean that supergravity predicts infinite answers .",
    "it is just that it can not predict beyond a certain degree of accuracy .",
    "but in that , it is no different from perturbative string theory .",
    "the string loop perturbation series almost certainly does not converge , but is only an asymptotic expansion .",
    "this means that higher order loop corrections get smaller at first .",
    "but after a certain order , the loop corrections will get bigger again .",
    "thus at finite coupling , the string perturbation series will have only limited accuracy .",
    "we shall take the above as justification for discussing loss of quantum coherence in terms of general relativity or supergravity , rather than d - branes and strings .",
    "one might expect that loss of quantum coherence could occur not only in the evaporation of macroscopic black holes , but on a microscopic level as well , because of topological fluctuations in the metric that can be interpreted as closed loops of virtual black holes @xcite .",
    "particles could fall into these virtual black holes , which would then radiate other particles .",
    "the emitted particles would be in a mixed quantum state because the presence of the black hole horizons will mean that a quantum state will not be determined completely by its behavior at infinity .",
    "it is with such loss of coherence through scattering off virtual black holes that this paper is concerned .",
    "our primary intention is not to provide a rigorous demonstration that quantum coherence is lost , but rather to explore the effects that will arise , assuming that the semi - classical calculations are accurate , and it is lost .    in @xmath5 dimensions ,",
    "a single black hole has a euclidean section with topology @xmath6 .",
    "as has been seen in studies of black hole pair creation , a real or virtual loop of black holes has euclidean topology @xmath7 , where the point has been sent to infinity by a conformal transformation . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider @xmath8 , but the treatment for higher @xmath5 would be similar .    on the manifold @xmath9",
    "one should consider euclidean metrics that are asymptotic to flat space at infinity .",
    "such metrics can be interpreted as closed loops of virtual black holes .",
    "because they are off shell , they need not satisfy any field equations",
    ". they will contribute to the path integral , just as off shell loops of particles contribute to the path integral and produce measurable effects .",
    "the effect that we shall be concerned with for virtual black holes is loss of quantum coherence .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of such topological fluctuations that distinguishes them from ordinary unitary scattering , which is produced by fluctuations that do not change the topology .",
    "one can calculate scattering in an asymptotically euclidean metric on @xmath9 .",
    "one then weights with @xmath10 and integrates over all asymptotically euclidean metrics . this would give the full scattering with all quantum corrections .",
    "however , one can neither calculate the scattering in a general metric , nor integrate over all metrics .",
    "instead , what we shall do in the next two sections is point out some qualitative features of the scattering in general metrics , that indicate that quantum coherence is lost .",
    "we shall then illustrate the effects of loss of quantum coherence and obtain an estimate of their magnitude by calculating the scattering in a specific metric on @xmath9 , the @xmath0 metric .",
    "it is sufficient to show that quantum coherence is lost in some metrics in the path integral , because the integral over other metrics can not restore the quantum coherence lost in our examples .",
    "we do nt have much intuition for the behavior of euclidean green functions or their effect on scattering . however",
    ", if the euclidean metric has a hypersurface orthogonal killing vector , it can be analytically continued to a real lorentzian metric , in which it is much easier to see what is happening .",
    "we shall therefore consider scattering in such metrics .    the lorentzian section of an asymptotically euclidean metric which has topology @xmath11 will contain a pair of black holes that accelerate away from each other and go off to infinity .",
    "one might think that this is not very physical , but it is no different from a closed loop of a particle like an electron . closed particle loops are really defined in euclidean space .",
    "if one analytically continues them to minkowski space , one gets a particle anti - particle pair accelerating away from each other .",
    "any topologically non - trivial asymptotically euclidean metric will appear to have solitons accelerating to infinity in the lorentzian section , but this does not mean that there are actual black holes at infinity , any more than there are runaway electrons and positrons with a virtual electron loop .",
    "one can regard the use of the lorentzian metric , with its black holes accelerating to infinity , as just a mathematical trick to evaluate the scattering on the euclidean solution .    to understand the structure of these accelerating black hole metrics , it is helpful to draw penrose diagrams .",
    "start with the penrose diagram for rindler space with the left and right acceleration horizons , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and past and future null infinity , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see figure [ rind ] ) .",
    "a uniformly accelerated particle moves on a world line that goes out to @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the points where they intersect the acceleration horizons .",
    "one now replaces the accelerating particle and the similar accelerating particle on the other side with black holes .",
    "thus , one replaces the regions of rindler space to the right and left of the accelerating world lines with intersecting black hole horizons .",
    "it turns out that the two accelerating black holes are just the two sides of the same three dimensional wormhole , so one has to identify the two sides of the penrose diagram , and the penrose diagram will look like the one in figure [ fig1 ] . at first sight",
    "it looks as if one has lost half of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , but that is because this penrose diagram applies only on the axis .",
    "one can get a better idea of the causal structure near infinity from figure [ fig2 ] , in which a conformal transformation has been used to make @xmath15 into a cylinder @xmath16 , with the null generators lying in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "the hypersurface orthogonal killing vector of the euclidean metric that allows continuation to a lorentzian metric will be a boost killing vector in the accelerating black hole metric and it will have two fixed points @xmath18 and @xmath19 on @xmath15 , lying on generators @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the past light cones of @xmath18 and @xmath19 minus the generators @xmath20 and @xmath21 form the acceleration horizons .",
    "thus one can see that nearly every null geodesic outside the black hole horizons goes out to @xmath15 in the region to the future of both acceleration horizons .",
    "the exceptions are the null geodesics that are exactly in the boost direction , which intersect the generators @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "we shall ignore @xmath20 and @xmath21 as a set of measure zero on @xmath23 , and a number of the statements we shall make will be valid modulo this set of measure zero .",
    "the analytically continued euclidean green functions will define a vacuum state @xmath24 which is the analogue of the so - called hartle hawking state @xcite for a static black hole .",
    "the euclidean quantum state can be characterized by saying that positive frequency means positive frequency with respect to the affine parameters on the horizons . in the accelerating black hole metrics",
    "there are two kinds of horizons , black hole and acceleration .",
    "each kind of horizon consists of two intersecting null hypersurfaces , which we shall refer to as left and right , as in figure [ fig1 ] . in choosing a cauchy surface for the spacetime ( modulo a set of measure zero )",
    ", we break the symmetry between left and right , and choose say the left acceleration horizon and the right black hole horizon .",
    "the quantum state defined by positive frequency with respect to the affine parameters on these horizons is the same as the quantum state defined by the other choice of horizons .",
    "another cauchy surface in the future ( again modulo a set of measure zero ) is formed by @xmath23 and the future parts of the black hole horizons @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as in figure 4 .",
    "there is a natural notion of positive frequency on @xmath23 . on the black hole horizons",
    "the concept of positive frequency is less well defined .",
    "one could use rindler time , but in any case , what one observes on @xmath23 is independent of the choice of positive frequency on the black hole horizons .    the quantum state of a field @xmath27 on this background metric will be determined by data on either of these cauchy surfaces .",
    "this means that the hilbert space @xmath28 of quantum fields on this background metric will be isomorphic to the tensor products of the fock spaces on their components : @xmath29 the vacuum state defined by the euclidean green functions is the product of the vacuum states of the fock spaces for the left acceleration horizon and right black hole horizon ; latexmath:[\\[\\label{state }    because of frequency mixing , the euclidean quantum state wo nt be the product of the fock vacuum states on @xmath23 and the future black hole horizons .",
    "rather it will be a state containing pairs of particles .",
    "both members of the pair may go out to @xmath23 , or both may fall into the holes , or one go out to @xmath23 and one fall in",
    ".    equation ( [ hor ] ) shows that quantum field theory on an accelerating black hole background does not satisfy the asymptotic completeness condition that the hilbert space of the quantum fields on the background is isomorphic to the asymptotic hilbert space of states on @xmath23 .",
    "asymptotic completeness is the necessary and sufficient condition for scattering of quantum fields on the background to be unitary @xcite .",
    "thus there will be loss of quantum coherence .",
    "what happens is that to calculate the probability of observing particles at @xmath23 , one has to trace out over all possibilities on the future black hole horizons .",
    "this reduces the euclidean quantum state to what appears to be a mixed quantum state described by a density matrix .    in a recent pair of papers @xcite",
    ", yi argued that the euclidean quantum state in the ernst metric would contain no radiation at infinity .",
    "the ernst metric is similar to the metrics we are considering .",
    "however , in the explicit calculation that we carry out in the @xmath0 metric , we find that there is indeed radiation at infinity .",
    "what s wrong with yi s argument ?",
    "as he was working with the ernst metric , which is nt asymptotically flat , he was nt able to study the radiation at infinity directly .",
    "he therefore assumed that if there was no radiation on the acceleration horizon , there would be no radiation at infinity .",
    "but if we evolve some state forward from one of the acceleration horizons to @xmath15 , part of the state can fall into the future black hole horizon .",
    "therefore , there can be a non - trivial bogoliubov transformation between the acceleration horizon and infinity , and yi s assumption is incorrect",
    ".    the euclidean quantum state @xmath31 will be time symmetric , and so will contain both incoming and outgoing radiation .",
    "unlike the euclidean state for static black holes , there wo nt be radiation to infinity at a steady rate for an infinite time .",
    "instead , the radiation will be peaked around the points @xmath18 and @xmath19 where the acceleration horizons intersect @xmath23 .",
    "the radiation will die off at early and late times and the total energy radiated will be finite .    is this the appropriate quantum state ?",
    "in the case of a static black hole , one usually imposes the boundary condition that there is no incoming radiation on @xmath32 .",
    "this means that one has to subtract the incoming radiation from the euclidean state to give what is called the unruh state .",
    "this is singular on the past horizon , but that does nt matter , as one normally replaces this region of the metric with the metric of a collapsing body .",
    "the energy for the steady rate of outgoing radiation comes from a slow decrease of the mass of the black hole formed by the collapse .",
    "however , in the case of a virtual black hole loop , there is no collapse process to remove the singularities on the past horizons of the black holes or supply the energy of the outgoing radiation .",
    "therefore , we should study the euclidean vacuum state , in which the energy of the outgoing radiation is supplied by the incoming radiation on @xmath32 .",
    "our view therefore is that integrating over gauge equivalent virtual black hole metrics will cause the amplitude to be zero unless the energy of the outgoing particle or particles is matched by particles with the same energy falling in .",
    "one might object that one would never have exactly the combination of incoming particles that corresponded to the quantum state obtained from the euclidean green functions .",
    "however , the euclidean quantum state will appear to be a mixed quantum state on @xmath14 which contains every possible combination of incoming particles .",
    "one can choose one of these combinations as an initial pure quantum state that is incident on the virtual black hole loop .",
    "the final quantum state will then be that part of the euclidean quantum state on @xmath23 that has the same energy , momentum and angular momentum as the incoming state . because of the trace over the future black hole horizon states , the final state on @xmath23 will be mixed .",
    "such an evolution from pure to mixed states can be described by a superscattering operator @xmath33 rather than an @xmath3 matrix @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution will presumably come from virtual black hole loops of planck size .",
    "the cross section for a low energy particle to fall into a planck size static black hole is very low unless the particle is spin @xmath34 or @xmath35 @xcite . in the case of spin @xmath35 ,",
    "the probability of emission will be reduced because the fermi - dirac factor @xmath36 tends to @xmath37 at low @xmath38 while @xmath39 tends to @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests the effects of virtual black holes will be small except for scalar particles . in this paper",
    "we shall therefore do a scattering calculation for scalar particles in the @xmath0 metric .",
    "this does nt really qualify as a virtual black hole metric , because it has conical singularities on the axis , although one can interpret these as cosmic strings .",
    "we study the @xmath0 metric because it has the same topological structure as a virtual black hole pair , but it has the great advantage that one can calculate the scattering , because the wave equation separates .",
    "the charged @xmath0 metric solution is @xcite @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 the gauge potential is @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "we define @xmath45 .",
    "we constrain the parameters so that @xmath46 has four roots , which we label by @xmath47 . to obtain the right signature ,",
    "we restrict @xmath48 to @xmath49 , and @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the inner black hole horizon lies at @xmath52 , the outer black hole horizon at @xmath53 , and the acceleration horizon at @xmath54 .",
    "the axis @xmath55 points towards the other black hole , and the axis @xmath56 points towards infinity .",
    "spatial infinity is at @xmath57 , null and timelike infinity at @xmath58 .",
    "this metric describes a pair of oppositely - charged black holes accelerating away from each other , although the coordinate system used in ( [ cmetric ] ) only covers the neighborhood of one of the black holes .    to avoid having a conical singularity between the two black holes ,",
    "we choose @xmath59 this implies that there will be a conical deficit along @xmath60 , with deficit angle @xmath61 physically , we imagine that this represents a cosmic string of mass per unit length @xmath62 along @xmath60 . at large spatial distances ,",
    "that is , as @xmath63 , the @xmath0 metric ( [ cmetric ] ) reduces to flat space with conical deficit @xmath64 in accelerated coordinates .",
    "the @xmath0 metric also reduces to flat space if we set @xmath65 .",
    "it reduces to a single static black hole if we set @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath67 is referred to as the point - particle limit , as in this limit the black hole is small on the scale set by the acceleration .",
    "the @xmath0 metric was shown to be asymptotically flat in @xcite .",
    "this is a considerable advantage over , say , the ernst metric , as it means we will have a well - defined notion of @xmath68 , and we can study the radiation at infinity directly .",
    "if we neglect the axis @xmath69 , all observers will intersect the acceleration horizon before reaching infinity , and the causal structure of the solution is roughly speaking given by the penrose diagram shown in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ". however , the metric is not spherically symmetric , so this diagram is not a true picture of the whole spacetime .",
    "we will refer to the left and right acceleration horizons as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and to the left and right outer black hole horizons as @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "further , the future and past halves of each horizon will be denoted by superscripts @xmath72 .",
    "hopefully the diagram clarifies the meaning of this notation .",
    "we will only discuss the behavior at future null infinity .",
    "as the metric is time - symmetric , the discussion of past null infinity will be identical .",
    "we can conformally compactify the @xmath0 metric by using a conformal factor @xmath73 .",
    "the conformally rescaled metric is @xmath74 null infinity is the surface @xmath75 , that is , @xmath76 ( more precisely , its maximal extension ; the coordinate system of ( [ conc ] ) misses the generator on which the other black hole intersects @xmath15 @xcite ) .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath15 is @xmath77 note that , at null infinity , @xmath78 is a spatial coordinate .",
    "the normal to @xmath15 is @xmath79 we see that @xmath78 and @xmath80 are constant along the orbits of @xmath81 , which are the generators of @xmath15 , so they are good coordinates on the manifold of orbits of @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to define new coordinates @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( so @xmath84 ) .",
    "we also make a further conformal rescaling with a conformal factor @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 in this conformal gauge , an affine parameter along the generators of @xmath15 is @xmath87 it is also useful to define another coordinate @xmath88 which labels the @xmath89 cross - sections .",
    "the structure of @xmath90 in the conformal gauge ( [ scricm ] ) is depicted in figure [ fig2 ] . in this conformal gauge ,",
    "@xmath15 is divergence - free , and @xmath82 are coordinates on the manifold of generators of @xmath15 , so we can see that @xmath15 has topology @xmath91 .",
    "we can obtain the euclidean section of the @xmath0 metric by setting @xmath92 in ( [ cmetric ] ) . to make the euclidean metric positive definite , we need to restrict the range of @xmath50 to @xmath93 .",
    "there are then potentially conical singularities at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which have to be eliminated .",
    "we can avoid having a conical singularity at @xmath54 by taking @xmath94 to be periodic with period @xmath95 in this paper , we assume the black holes are non - extreme , that is , @xmath96 .",
    "we can then only avoid having a conical singularity at @xmath53 by taking the two horizons to have the same temperature , so that both conical singularities can be removed by the same choice of @xmath97 .",
    "this implies @xmath98 the euclidean section has topology @xmath99 .",
    "this euclidean section can be used to study the pair creation of black holes by breaking cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "however , we want to use it simply to determine the appropriate vacuum state on the lorentzian section .",
    "since the black hole and acceleration horizon have the same temperature on the euclidean section , the analytic continuation will give green s functions which are thermal with temperature @xmath100 with respect to the time parameter @xmath78 in the lorentzian section .",
    "the region of the spacetime outside the inner horizon of the black holes is globally hyperbolic .",
    "consider a cauchy surface for this region which is made up of one black hole horizon and one acceleration horizon ( say the left acceleration horizon and the right black hole horizon ) , as pictured in figure [ fig1 ] . as explained earlier ,",
    "the hilbert space is isomorphic to the tensor product of the fock spaces on the two horizons ( [ hor ] ) .",
    "positive frequency on the fock spaces is defined with respect to the affine parameter along the horizon .",
    "the state we wish to study is the analytically - continued euclidean vacuum state @xmath101 given in ( [ state ] ) .    in the next section",
    ", we will describe the solution of the scalar wave equation on the @xmath0 metric background .",
    "we then use this to calculate the bogoliubov coefficients in the subsequent section .",
    "we consider a minimally - coupled massless neutral scalar field , so the wave equation is just @xmath102 .",
    "one of the great advantages of considering the @xmath0 metric is that this equation separates .",
    "it is easy to see this if we observe that the @xmath0 metric is a solution of the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations , and hence @xmath103 .",
    "the minimally coupled equation above is therefore equivalent to the conformally - invariant equation @xmath104 .",
    "but in solving this latter equation , we are free to make conformal transformations",
    ". in particular , we can transform to the conformal gauge ( [ conc ] ) , in which this equation takes the form @xmath105 + \\partial_x [ g(x ) \\partial_x \\tilde{\\phi } ] + \\frac{1}{g(x)}\\partial_\\varphi \\partial_\\varphi \\tilde{\\phi } + \\frac{1}{6}[\\partial_x^2g(x ) - \\partial_y^2g(y ) ] \\tilde{\\phi } = 0 ,    \\label{cweq}\\ ] ] where because of the conformal rescaling , @xmath106 .",
    "thus we see that if we use the ansatz @xmath107 then we get two second - order odes for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 - \\frac{1}{g(x)}m^2 \\nu(x)+ [ \\frac{1}{6 } \\partial_x^2g(x ) + d ] \\nu(x ) = 0     \\label{xeq}\\ ] ] and @xmath111 + \\frac{1}{g(y)}\\omega^2 \\gamma(y)+   [ \\frac{1}{6 } \\partial_y^2g(y ) + d ] \\gamma(y ) = 0 ,    \\label{yeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is a separation constant , and @xmath46 is given in ( [ gxi ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath80 is a periodic coordinate with period @xmath113 .",
    "thus @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is an integer . we assume , without loss of generality , that it is positive .    one way to rewrite these equations that offers some further insight is to define new coordinates @xmath116 which have the advantage that @xmath117 .",
    "note that the integral for @xmath118 in ( [ zchi ] ) diverges as we approach a horizon , as @xmath119 at the horizons .",
    "thus , @xmath120 only covers the region between two of the horizons ; similarly , @xmath121 is mapped to @xmath122 .",
    "we can write ( [ xeq],[yeq ] ) as @xmath123 @xmath124 that is , ( [ yeq ] ) reduces to the one - dimensional wave equation with effective potential @xmath125 , which is given by @xmath126.\\ ] ] there is a similar expression for @xmath127 .",
    "it is not possible to invert ( [ zchi ] ) to obtain @xmath128 explicitly , but we can make some observations . near the horizons , @xmath119 , and",
    "thus the effective potential becomes unimportant , so @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , near @xmath130 , @xmath131 . obviously , for physically - interesting solutions , we must have @xmath132 as @xmath133 .",
    "we can rewrite the metric ( [ cmetric ] ) in terms of these coordinates : @xmath134,\\ ] ] where by @xmath135 we mean @xmath136 , @xmath128 .",
    "this coordinate system evidently only covers the region between two of the horizons ( or between the acceleration horizon and infinity ) .",
    "that is , there is a coordinate system like this for each of the diamond - shaped regions in the penrose diagram in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ". we will therefore refer to these as the rindlerian coordinates .",
    "we can now define null coordinates @xmath137 .",
    "since @xmath118 increases as we go from the acceleration horizon towards the black hole horizon , the @xmath138 and @xmath139 coordinates run as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "thus , @xmath138 is a ( non - affine ) parameter along @xmath140 and @xmath141 , while @xmath139 is a ( non - affine ) parameter along @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "as is usual for bifurcate killing horizons , these parameters are related to the affine parameters @xmath144 on the acceleration horizon by @xmath145 , @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the common surface gravity of the two horizons .",
    "these coordinates are useful for specifying boundary conditions near the black hole and the acceleration horizons , and we will see later that we can easily write down explicit forms for the positive - frequency wavefunctions on the horizons in terms of them .",

    "if we restrict our attention to the region near @xmath284 , we can expand @xmath304 in a power series , and we see that the integrand is most nearly constant near @xmath284 if @xmath305 , so we expect that the bogoliubov coefficient will be peaked at @xmath305",
    ". this peak will become narrower as @xmath306 , approaching a delta function in the limit , but the amplitude tends to zero in this limit because of the factor of @xmath199 in front of the integral , so this does not imply infinite particle production .",
    "the leading - order part of the total particle production along the generator labeled by @xmath279 is given by integrating @xmath307 over @xmath199 and @xmath285 ; we ca nt do this integral , but given the arguments above , it seems reasonable to expect the answer to be finite .",
    "the integration over all generators , which gives the total particle production , will not give rise to any divergences either .",
    "in the first part of this paper , we argued that the scattering off virtual black hole pairs , which could lead to loss of quantum coherence in ordinary scattering processes , could be discussed in terms of a path integral over euclidean metrics with topology @xmath308 . in this approach ,",
    "one considers the scattering in each metric and performs a path integral over all such metrics .",
    "since we can not perform this path integral , we then restricted the discussion to one such metric , and analytically continued the solution to a lorentzian section to make the scattering easier to understand .",
    "we argued that the appropriate quantum state is the analytically - continued euclidean vacuum state @xmath101 , and we argued that this state will contain a finite , non - zero number of particles at infinity .",
    "it is well - known that from the point of view of an observer co - moving with the black holes , this state corresponds to a thermal equilibrium between the black holes and a thermal bath of acceleration radiation .",
    "thus , this state must be time - reversal invariant , which means that the particle content at past null infinity @xmath14 is the time - reverse of the particle content at future null infinity @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that no net energy is gained or lost by the black holes in this scattering process , which is what we would expect for a model of a virtual loop , and is in agreement with the fact that the state is an equilibrium as seen by co - moving observers .",
    "the fact that there is a non - zero number of particles at @xmath15 implies that there is loss of quantum coherence in this semi - classical calculation , as each particle detected at infinity can be thought of as one member of a virtual pair , the other one of which has fallen into the black hole , carrying away information .",
    "more formally , there are correlations between modes on future infinity and modes on the future black hole horizon , and the information encoded in these correlations is lost because we do not observe the state on the future black hole horizon .",
    "this loss of quantum coherence is of the same character as that observed in static black holes .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we proceeded to an explicit calculation of the scattering in the @xmath0 metric .",

    "however , we believe it is a reasonably good model for a virtual black hole loop , and the wave equation separates in this background , so it is relatively easy to study the scattering explicitly .",
    "the @xmath0 metric is asymptotically flat @xcite , so it is also straightforward to study the radiation at infinity .",
    "one slightly surprising fact about the structure at infinity is that the affine parameter along generators of @xmath15 is @xmath212 , which is spacelike between the black hole and acceleration horizons , while the boost time coordinate @xmath78 becomes a spacelike coordinate labeling the generators of @xmath15 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the transmission factor @xmath257 .",
    "this implies that the dominant contribution to the particle production is in the s - wave , as for static black holes , because of the high centrifugal potential barrier for higher - spin modes .",
    "it also suggests that the scattering of higher - spin fields off such virtual black hole loops will be suppressed relative to that of scalar fields , as they can not radiate in the s - wave .",
    "this is in agreement with the arguments of @xcite .",
    "the calculation we have actually been able to perform is rather limited ; we considered only one specific , rather special metric , and we were only able to study the scattering on it in a particular limit .",

    "<S> although it is not possible to properly compute the scattering off such fluctuations , we argue that one can get useful qualitative results , which provide a guide to the possible effects of such scattering , by considering a quantum field on the @xmath0 metric , which has the same topology as a virtual black hole pair . </S>",
    "<S> we study a scalar field on the lorentzian @xmath0 metric background , with the scalar field in the analytically - continued euclidean vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are a finite number of particles at infinity in this state , contrary to recent claims made by yi . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this state is not determined by data at infinity , and there is loss of quantum coherence in this semi - classical calculation .    </S>",
