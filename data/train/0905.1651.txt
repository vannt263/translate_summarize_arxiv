    "the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( hereafter , cmb ) anisotropies from satellite , ground based and balloon - borne experiments such as wmap ( @xcite ) , boomerang - b2k ( @xcite ) , acbar ( @xcite ) and quad ( @xcite ) have revolutionized the field of cosmology .",
    "the precise measurements of the acoustic oscillations in the angular power spectrum of the cmb have indeed not only provided a confirmation of the standard model of structure formation but also constrained key parameters as the curvature , the energy density in baryons and cold dark matter , and the shape of the primordial inflationary perturbations .",
    "the new measurements expected by future experiments as planck will certainly improve our knowledge of the cmb anisotropies by providing maps at higher angular resolutions and in a broader frequency spectrum ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the highest impact for cosmology is however expected not from temperature but from polarization measurements .",
    "the current measurements of cmb polarization ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , while firmly establishing a detection broadly in agreement with the standard model predictions , lack the precision needed to improve substantially the cosmological constraints . especially on large angular scales , an accurate future measurement of cmb polarization will certainly shed light on crucial aspects as the epoch and history of cosmic reionization ( @xcite ) and the amount of primordial isocurvature perturbations ( @xcite ) .",
    "more ambitiously , the cmb polarization is perhaps the most promising tool for detecting the background of primordial gravitational waves , generated during inflation @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of cmb linear polarization are indeed fully characterized by two sets of spin-2 multipole moments with opposite parities . in the standard inflationary paradigm",
    "the primordial magnetic - type modes ( @xmath3 or curl modes ) are only produced by gravity waves ( or `` tensor '' metric perturbations @xcite ) , while density ( scalar ) perturbations only excite electric - like parity modes ( @xmath4 or gradient modes ) and they do not correlate with each other ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a detection of polarization @xmath3-modes at large angular scales will clearly hint towards the presence of a gravitational wave background and open a window on the physics of inflation , at extreme energy scales .    however , since the seminal paper by carroll et al .",
    "( @xcite ) the possibility of a _ cosmological birefringence _ , or _ in vacuo _ rotation of the polarization direction of a photon , has been considered by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . even if exotic , cosmological birefringence",
    "is therefore predicted by a wide class of non - standard models and provides information on symmetry violations and on pseudoscalar fields beyond the standard model .",
    "the main effect of such rotation is to mix the @xmath4 and @xmath3 modes . considering the usual @xmath5 coefficients of the expansions in legendre polynomials of the corresponding two - point angular correlation functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the effect of cosmological birefringence is to correlate the spectra by an angle @xmath6 such that :    @xmath7    where the new quantities affected by birefringence are denoted with a prime .",
    "as we can see , even if one assumes a standard scenario where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 correlations are zero at the last scattering surface ( lss ) , cosmic birefringence introduces a new @xmath8 component from @xmath11 .",
    "the above equations are exact for a constant rotation , and approximate very well the effects of a rotation angle varying with time if the time variation is sufficiently slow and the resulting total rotation after the propagation of photons ( from lss toward us ) is sufficiently small , which is the case for most models of interest ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the final result is that @xmath3-modes polarization could therefore not only be sourced by gravitational waves but also from a completely different physics .",
    "while both gravity waves and cosmic birefringence would represent sensational discoveries , one has to deal also with less exciting and definitely more common possibilities as experimental systematics .",
    "cosmic birefringence could indeed be mostly exactly mimicked by a simple mismatch in the calibration of the principal axis orientation of the polarimeters .",
    "let us remind that polarization can be fully described by the four stokes parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "information about linear polarization are encoded in the q and u parameters that depend on the reference frame .",
    "a wrong definition of the principal axis of the polarimeter which rotates the reference frame of an angle @xmath6 will lead to un - properly defined and mixed @xmath13 and @xmath14 , thus resulting in a mixing between @xmath4 and @xmath3 modes and producing a change in the polarization power spectra in the same way as described by equations [ eq : rotpse ] .",
    "cosmic birefringence and how to disentangle it from spurious systematics is therefore a very timely subject of investigation and has already motivated several recent papers .",
    "for example , the possibility of _ de - rotating _",
    "cmb polarization and to reconstruct the rotation angle by measurements of higher - order @xmath16 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 correlations has been suggested in @xcite and analyzed in detail in @xcite , while in @xcite the effects of beam systematics ( which can mimic the rotation of polarization plane ) have been considered .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the effects that a rotation of the polarization plane , regardless of its origin , has on the determination of cosmological parameters from cmb data when the effect is not properly taken into account .",
    "in particular , a miscalibration can produce a bias on cosmological parameters as the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the hubble constant @xmath19 , the optical depth @xmath20 , the inflationary spectral index @xmath21 , and a false detection of gravitational waves other than obviously be confused with a genuine cosmological birefringence .",
    "we also discuss in detail the benefits of inserting a specific parameter describing a rotation of systematical origin in the analysis and we employ our formalism on recent data provided by the boomerang - b2k experiment as well on simulated datasets of the planck and epic missions . in the case of boomerang - b2k we show that previous marginal detection of cosmological birefringence that have been pointed out by @xcite , could be partially explained by a systematic effect .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : syst ] we discuss the calibration method adopted for the boomerang - b2k experiment and few cases that can induce a systematic rotation of the plane of a polarimeter in future missions ; in section [ sec : method ] we set forth our methodology which we apply in section [ sec : b03 ] to revisit the boomerang - b2k constraints on cosmological birefringence ; finally in section [ sec : forecast ] we forecast the impact of a systematic rotation on future experiments .",
    "in general , polarimeters for the cmb must detect intensity and linear polarization . both can be described through the stokes i , q and u parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one horned radio - meters and polarization sensitive bolometers ( psb ) measure the quantity : @xmath22 + \\varepsilon u(\\hat \\gamma_t ) \\sin [ 2 ( \\delta+\\beta)]\\ } + n_t\\ ] ] where @xmath23 labels time , @xmath24 is the detector gain , @xmath25 the observed sky direction is given by a convolution between the true sky and an optical response function ( or `` beam '' ) , which is a tensor in the case of polarization sensitive detectors .",
    "such detail is irrelevant here , so we simplify the description assuming an infinite resolution scalar beam ] , @xmath26 is the detector noise , @xmath27 is the angle between the telescope reference frame and a meridian in the sky , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the polarimeter properties , so defined :    * @xmath28 is the cross polarization , the ratio between the minimum and the maximum signal from the polarimeter , when a linearly polarized source is rotated in front of it ; * @xmath29 is the angle at which the polarimeter is maximally sensitive to a vertical linear polarization , in the telescope reference frame",
    ".    these parameters must be accurately calibrated .",
    "an incorrect measure of @xmath28 will result in a fake attenuation or amplification of the polarization and therefore will induce a bias in the q and u maps .",
    "an incorrect measure of @xmath29 will result in leakage from q to u and from u to q , thus to a further `` mixing '' of the cmb polarization angular power spectra in equations [ eq : rotpse ] above : any anaccounted rotation of the polarimeter will mimic a genuine rotation of the photon polarization plane .",
    "there are several techniques to measure the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath28 , depending on the instrument characteristics . + in the case of boomerang - b2k , the polarimeters have been calibrated in the lab prior the flight . the calibration is obtained using a dedicated apparatus , able to illuminate the full telescope with a linearly polarized source , modulated by a chopper wheel . a description of this system is reported in @xcite ( see figure 12 in that paper ) .",
    "the polarization angle of the source can be rotated as needed to cover the full range @xmath30 , and the angle @xmath29 for each of the detectors has been measured by means of a best fit procedure .",
    "even if the associated statistical error was small , there are systematic errors in the alignment of the calibration source and of the telescope during the calibration .",
    "these , however , affect in the same way all the 16 detectors of the instrument .",
    "so if we consider the dataset of the 16 measurements of @xmath29 @xcite , the average value of the difference between nominal and measured orientations is @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that this is due to the above mentioned attitude misalignment .",
    "this value will be used as a prior for the @xmath29 angle in the following analysis . instead , the standard deviation of the differences between nominal and measured orientations is @xmath32 if we include all the 16 detectors , and is @xmath33 if we just include only the eight 145 ghz detectors .",
    "these values indicate the effect of rotation errors in the assembly of the polarimeters , and can be used as an estimate of the precision of the direction of the main axis for the boomerang - b2k polarimeters .",
    "the axis direction error propagates on the measured power spectra following eq.1 .",
    "so in the following we will mainly consider the effect of a general rotation of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "+ in the case of satellite mission such as planck calibration procedure are even more delicate .",
    "the optical characteristics can change in space due to thermo - elastic effects , and ground based measurements must be extrapolated to flight conditions .",
    "alternatively these parameters can be measured in flight by observation of a strong linearly polarized source .",
    "the most interesting source from this point of view is the crab nebula , which must be observed in advance by some ground based telescope in order to provide a reliable calibrator . in the case of planck hfi",
    ", the issue of the polarimeter angle is complicated even more by the fact that , in the psb employed , the polarimeter angle depends on the details of the lithographic properties of the detector and its coupling to the feeds . for the radio - meters on board planck lfi @xmath35",
    "is expected to be very close to unity , given to the excellent isolation provided by the omt .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath29 is subject to similar potential uncertainties as bolometers and must be calibrated in flight . for planck ,",
    "the uncertainty on the polarimeter calibration properties are not been disclosed yet . in the following ,",
    "we assess what calibration accuracy should be achieved with planck to yield unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "to understand the impact of a systematic rotation of the cmb linear polarization plane on the determination of cosmological parameters , we analyze a set of cmb data with a modified version of the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath36 chains with a convergence diagnostics done through the gelman and rubin statistic , as now common in the literature . for the cmb data - sets we analyze either the already published boomerang - b2k data , including the @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra from the na data analysis pipeline ( see @xcite ) , either simulated mock data for the ongoing / future planck@xcite and epic@xcite satellite missions . for boomerang - b2k",
    "we consider two rotation angles ( @xmath29 and @xmath37 ) in order to take into account both a systematic and a possible additional angle of true , cosmic birefringence , origin .    for planck and epic",
    "we focus on a single rotation angle and we study the impact on the cosmological inferences drawn by those missions and , in particular , on the detection of a @xmath3-modes signal from primordial gravity waves .    when simulating the planck and epic future data we assume as fiducial model the maximum likelihood wmap5 parameters but with different values of miscalibration angles .",
    "we therefore sample the following eight - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath40 , the scalar spectral index @xmath21 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath41 at @xmath42 mpc@xmath43 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath20 , the tensor to scalar ratio of the primordial spectrum @xmath44 and the systematic rotation angle @xmath29 .",
    "we also use a cosmic age tophat prior as @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions , we impose flatness and we treat the dark energy component as a cosmological constant .",
    "+ in the case of the boomerang - b2k dataset we include an additional rotation angle but we fix @xmath46 consistent with the wmap5 measurement ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider the @xmath47 , @xmath16 , @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 power spectra of the cosmic microwave background obtained by the boomerang - b2k experiment flown in jan .",
    "2003 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this dataset has already being analyzed in previous papers .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite a claim for a @xmath48 indication for cosmic birefringence from this data was presented . here",
    "we re - analyze the issue by including an additional systematic uncertainty @xmath29 on the rotation angle together with the rotation angle @xmath37 assumed as sourced by a true signal of cosmic birefringence .    while both rotation angles affect the cmb spectra as in eq .",
    "1 , there are few differences .",
    "first of all , only photons coming from the last scattering surface at redshift @xmath49 are affected by the birefringence angle @xmath37 .",
    "we therefore do not rotate with @xmath37 the cmb spectra for @xmath50 since the cmb signal from those angular scales is assumed to be sourced from smaller red - shift @xmath51 when the reionization process starts ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "second , we do not let the systematic angle @xmath29 to vary as a free parameter but we impose a gaussian prior on it as @xmath52 at @xmath53 motivated by the discussion presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : syst ] .    without systematic effects ( @xmath54 )",
    "we found that the boomerang - b2k data , with a prior on the optical depth @xmath46 , yields a @xmath55 evidence for cosmological birefringence with @xmath56 at @xmath57 c.l .",
    ", in agreement with the previous results of @xcite .",
    "we have then included the possibility of a systematic angle @xmath29 .",
    "taking into account @xmath29 and the prior on it we instead find @xmath0 at @xmath57 c.l .",
    ", marginalizing over @xmath29 .",
    "as we can see , even if the the weak indication for cosmological birefringence is still present , the inclusion of @xmath29 reduces the statistical significance at about @xmath58 level .",
    "-@xmath29 plane , showing the @xmath57 and @xmath59 confidence level contours from the boomerang - b2k data .",
    "[ fig : boom ] ]    it is also interesting to note that from fig.[fig : boom ] , where we plot the @xmath60-d likelihood contour plot from the boomerang - b2k data on the @xmath37-@xmath29 plane , the probability that the detected rotation is due only to a miscalibration ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) is suppressed . as we can see in table",
    "[ tab : boom_results ] the constraints on the cosmological parameters from boomerang - b2k data are not much affected by the calibration error , only the upper limit on @xmath44 is slightly relaxed .",
    ".@xmath63 confidence level on cosmological parameters obtained by analyzing boomerang - b2k data with and without including the systematic rotation angle @xmath29 in the analysis . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we analyze in more detail the case of the planck mission in table [ tab : results ] where we show the effects on @xmath44 separately for different channels . for the lfi @xmath64  ghz channel , the results on @xmath44 are not dramatically affected even for an unaccounted miscalibration of @xmath65 .",
    "the hfi @xmath66 ghz channel has higher sensitivity and is expected to drive accurate results on cosmological parameters , even in the case where a set of frequency maps is used to provide a reference foreground cleaned cmb map .",
    "the @xmath66 ghz channel can , however , be heavily affected by a miscalibration in the polarization angle .",
    "for instance , a value of @xmath67 will affect the expected bound on @xmath44 by relaxing it at about @xmath68 . a larger miscalibration by @xmath65 , if not properly accounted for , will have dramatic implications for this channel producing a fake detection of non - zero @xmath3 modes at more than @xmath69 confidence level . for the other two hfi channels considered here (",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 ghz ) there is no spurious detection of gravitational waves even for a systematic angle as big as @xmath72 , even if the bound on @xmath44 gets relaxed .",
    "even a miscalibration @xmath73 could , in the case of planck , yield biased results for @xmath44 if a genuine cosmological rotation ( @xmath37 ) is present but not accounted for in the analysis .",
    "this because an unaccounted rotation can in principle bias @xmath44 regardless of its origin ( i.e.  genuine or systematic ) . as a consequence ,",
    "it is always necessary to include @xmath29 among the derived parameters even in the case where the systematic rotation is kept under control .",
    "if a rotation is detected , disentangling its origin ( cosmological or not ) only based on the data is more troublesome .",
    "if cosmological birefringence is expected to scale with energy , as predicted by some models ( see @xcite ) the analysis of multifrequency data can shed light on the nature of the effect observed , since calibration errors are not normally expected to mimic this behavior .",
    "models that do not display frequency scaling , on the other hand , can not be constrained in this way .",
    "another option is to rely on the @xmath74 scale dependency of the rotation .",
    "since the universe has undergone reionization , a fraction of the cmb photons have suffered an effective last scattering at @xmath75 , thus the magnitude of the accumulated rotations is expected to be severely suppressed at the lowest multipoles .",
    "a systematic rotation , instead , does not display the same behavior and hence this fact could potentially be used to disentangle the two effects . however , when we tried to verify this method on our planck simulations we discovered that the number of multipoles that are affected by reionazation is too low for the method to be useful at disentangling the two contributions . specifically , we chose not to rotate the multipoles @xmath76 , to find that the @xmath77 degeneracy can only be broken this way for amplitudes of order of several degrees , which is totally useless in a high precision context .",
    "thus , with the possible exception of exotic models with small scale angular variations , models that do not exhibit frequency scaling can only be constrained assuming an accurate enough calibration of the telescope s focal plane .    , @xmath78 , @xmath19 and @xmath44 with ( black solid line ) and without ( other solid lines ) including the rotation angle @xmath29 in the analysis .",
    "the noise considered for the mock data is equivalent to the overall expected sensitivity ( @xmath79 channels ) of the planck mission .",
    "the rotation angles considered in the fiducial model are : @xmath80 ( red ) , @xmath81 ( blue ) , @xmath82 ( green ) and @xmath83 ( cyan ) [ fig : planck ] ]    , @xmath78 , @xmath19 and @xmath44 with ( black solid line ) and without ( other solid lines ) including the rotation angle @xmath29 in the analysis .",
    "the noise considered for the mock data is equivalent to the @xmath84 ghz epic channel and @xmath85 is assumed in the fiducial model .",
    "the rotation angles considered are : @xmath86 ( red ) , @xmath87 ( blue ) , @xmath88 ( green ) and @xmath89 ( cyan ) [ fig : epic ] ]",
    "cmb polarization will be measured with exquisite precision by future experiments . a possible and worrying systematic that may affect",
    "this measurement is a miscalibration of the polarization reference frame . in this paper",
    "we have first investigated the impact of this systematic on the recent claim for a cosmic birefringence signal in the boomerang - b2k data .",
    "we have found that , when the calibration error in the polarization signal is properly taken into account , the constraint on a cosmic birefringence angle is @xmath0 at @xmath57 c.l .",
    ", i.e. almost consistent with a statistical fluctuation at one standard deviation .",
    "+ we have then analyzed the effect of a systematic rotation angle @xmath29 on the determination of cosmological parameters from future cmb surveys , with a particular attention on the implications for a detection of a gw background .",
    "we have found that for the planck mission , a miscalibration smaller than @xmath90 will have a negligible impact on the constraints for all parameters , while it could introduce a sizable bias for larger angles .",
    "for example , systematic error in the calibration of about @xmath91 ( i.e. at about @xmath92 from the expected calibration of @xmath90 ) would result in a @xmath93 gw s detection .",
    "we have shown that when including in the usual mcmc analysis the additional parameter @xmath29 to consider a possible rotation of the spectra ( of systematic or cosmological origin ) the bias disappears .",
    "we have also found that the planck hfi experiment will be able to constraint the angle @xmath29 with a precision of the order @xmath94 at @xmath59 and we have investigated the possibility to disentangle the systematic or cosmological origin of the rotation .",
    "however , the derived sensitivity on @xmath29 is one order of magnitude smaller than the precision achievable from direct , in - flight , measurements",
    ". it will be therefore mandatory either to calibrate the planck polarimeters with better than @xmath1 degree accuracy , either to include in future mcmc analysis @xmath29 as an extra parameter .    for the epic proposal , a value of @xmath95 could heavily affect the cosmological parameters , if not properly included in the analysis , leading to a misleading claim of gravity waves detection at @xmath92 level .",
    "on the other hand the sensitivity on @xmath29 will improve by one order of magnitude with @xmath96 at @xmath59 c.l . in mcmc analysis .",
