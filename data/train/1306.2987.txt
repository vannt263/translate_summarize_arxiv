    "spin foams @xcite provide a non - perturbative definition of the path integral for quantum gravity and thus a microscopic description of space time .",
    "the description of the path integral requires a regularization , which , as usual for non  perturbative approaches , is based on a discretization or lattice . indeed spin foams can be understood as generalized lattice gauge theories based on the group @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) .",
    "see for instance @xcite for a basic introduction based on lattice gauge theory .    given that spin foams provide a microscopic description of space time , a key task is to show that spin foams reproduce the familiar physics on large scales . due to the background independence of the models , there are two kinds of limits that one can consider .",
    "one limit would be to consider a triangulation with few building blocks where the physical size of these building blocks is large compared to planck lengths .",
    "this kind of limit is by now well understood @xcite using different techniques .",
    "it comes however with a large discretization scale and indeed the results of @xcite indicate that one should also consider a limit which involves many building blocks , such that the average physical size of the building blocks is small .    such a limit is automatically included if we study coarse graining of the models and fixed points under the coarse graining flow .",
    "moreover , we expect that a discrete notion of diffeomorphism symmetry is recovered at certain fixed points @xcite , which would also describe the continuum limit of the models via the concept of cylindrical consistent measures @xcite .",
    "this discrete notion of diffeomorphism symmetry is conjectured to be equivalent to discretization independence @xcite .",
    "as discretization independence also includes changing a very coarse triangulation into a very fine one , the two different kinds of limits should actually agree if one considers the models defined by these fixed points .",
    "thus the study of the coarse graining flow provides a key test : do we reproduce continuum space time ? however , the complexity of the models and a rather poor understanding of their dynamics ( i.e.  which parameters are relevant or irrelevant ) have so far prevented a systematic and explicit study .",
    "the goal of the present work is to face the previous question for simplified models that retain features of spin foam models .    for earlier more conceptual work on renormalization in spin foam models ,",
    "see i.e. @xcite .",
    "numerical ( monte carlo ) simulations have been performed for the barrett crane model @xcite , again with the aim to study the behaviour of the models in the limit of many building blocks .",
    "such monte carlo simulations are however only possible for the barrett crane model due to the positivity of its amplitudes .",
    "spin foams are however ( quantum mechanical ) state sums , and the positivity does indeed not hold for the more recent models , i.e. the eprl model .",
    "indeed the question arises whether one can define a statistical limit with such proper quantum models at all .",
    "our approach is based on tensor network renormalization group techniques @xcite , which can deal with negative ( or complex ) amplitudes .",
    "compared to monte carlo simulations it allows to obtain more information on the actual coarse graining flow and a more direct access to the structure of the fixed points .",
    "we also have to face the complexity of the models , including the possibilities of divergencies @xcite .",
    "indeed tensor network methods can not a priori be applied to models defined with a lie group ( having infinitely many irreducible representations ) , nor are these methods explored for four dimensional models . in @xcite",
    "we therefore introduced a simplified class of models , which ( a ) replaces the lie group with a finite group we are considering in this work leads to the same recoupling data and symbols ( apart from signs ) with the @xmath2 quantum group .",
    "thus we expect to find similar coarse graining results for this quantum group . ] and ( b ) replaces the gauge symmetry of spin foams by a global symmetry .",
    "the latter step allows to define non  trivial models in two dimensions , for which tensor network algorithms are known to give reliable results .",
    "these simplifications still allow to capture the key ingredients of spin foams , in particular the so  called simplicity constraints . the imposition of these constraints converts topological ( @xmath3 ) models to spin foams .",
    "indeed key progress will be made if we understand better the influence of these constraints on the dynamics of these models , and the fate of the simplicity constraints under coarse graining .",
    "the current work studies a particular example , based on the finite group @xmath4 , the group of permutations of three elements .",
    "this non  abelian group allows for non  trivial analogues of the simplicity constraints . as it will be explained in more detail",
    ", the introduction of these constraints extends the phase space of standard lattice models .",
    "a key question is therefore whether this extension leads to any additional phases or fixed points .",
    "whereas we will not find an additional ( extended ) phase , we will encounter an additional fixed point , which incorporates the simplicity constraints .",
    "another task is to identify relevant variables or parameters , as this knowledge may help to develop coarse graining techniques for the full spin foam models . here",
    "we will see that the dynamics of the models is determined by the weights for intertwiners , that appear in the construction of the models .",
    "this information will help to design coarse graining algorithms for the full models in future work .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ spinnets ]",
    "we introduce the so  called spin net models and describe its relation with spin foams . in section [ coarse ]",
    "we explain the algorithms that we employ to coarse grain our spin net models . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we particularize our study to models based on the simplest non - abelian group , namely the group of permutations of three elements .",
    "we will describe the different fixed points and phases encountered with our numerical coarse graining approach .",
    "our numerical analysis reveals the existence of a new fixed point , which is outside the initial space of models we consider",
    ". we will describe it in detail in section [ ffp ] . in section [ emb ]",
    "we characterize the different phases by using the concept of isometric embedding maps .",
    "we end with a discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "three appendices with technical details about recoupling theory have been added for sake of clarity .",
    "in this section we will describe the class of models that we will be considering .",
    "this choice of models is motivated by two considerations .",
    "first of all we want to consider models for which numerical simulations are feasible . it is not even clear which coarse graining methods are best suited yet , hence the models should be simple enough to develop new techniques and to adjust existing ones .",
    "for this reason we employ two main simplifications : we reduce the 4 dimensional spin foam models to 2 dimensional so  called spin net models .",
    "furthermore we reduce the lie groups ( which would require infinite summations ) to finite groups .",
    "the first reduction is motivated ( apart again by feasibility ) by an interesting similarity in statistical properties that exist between lattice gauge theories in 4 dimensions and corresponding ` edge ' models ( i.e. weights are on edges ) in 2 dimensions @xcite .",
    "spin foams and spin nets are an extension of the class of lattice gauge theories and edge models respectively , so it is not guaranteed that this analogy still holds .",
    "this would have to be tested by simulating 4d spin foams .",
    "nevertheless , spin foam and spin net models are described by the same dynamical ingredients , which gives us hope that the similarity between statistical properties may still hold .    there is another more direct relationship between spin nets and spin foams : the partition function of a spin net is equal to the partition function of a spin foam with two vertices and all faces just having two edges .",
    "thus the local gauge invariance of spin foams , represented on the two vertices , is converted into a global symmetry .",
    "we will comment more on this relationship below .",
    "a second reduction , motivated by amenability to numerical techniques and the issue of divergencies in spin foams @xcite , is to replace the lie groups , which would involve summation over an infinite range of indices ( representation labels ) by a finite group . for the models to capture non  trivial simplicity constraints this finite group needs to be non ",
    "an alternative is to consider @xmath5 at the root of unity , for which similar models can be defined @xcite .",
    "this will be subject for future work .",
    "( as mentioned earlier , we expect similar results for the quantum group @xmath2 as for @xmath4 . )",
    "another possibility one could consider , to make summation over representation labels finite , is a cut ",
    "off on the @xmath0 representations ( spin labels ) . indeed one might expect that under coarse graining larger and larger spin labels appear , so that one can reconstruct the vertex amplitude for very large spins .",
    "this line of thought is however not very promising : introducing a cut - off ( or a so  called heat kernel regularization ) leads to face weights used in lattice gauge theories describing yang mills like theories .",
    "the confinement conjecture states that these theories ( with a non  abelian structure group ) flow to the strong coupling limit under coarse graining .",
    "the strong coupling limit corresponds to the phase with degenerate geometries ( where geometric expectation operators have vanishing eigenvalues ) .",
    "thus it is unlikely that one will find a suitable geometric phase with such cut  off models , see also @xcite . for finite groups",
    "a phase transition between the strong and weak coupling limit ( deconfining and confining phase ) does occur and indeed we will argue that this is the physically most interesting region to consider .",
    "the construction of spin net models follows very closely that of the full spin foam models , in which the so  called simplicity constraints play a central role .",
    "spin foams take the topological @xmath3 theory as a starting point .",
    "this theory corresponds to the weak coupling limit of lattice gauge theory . in the spin representation ( usually employed for the strong coupling expansion )",
    "this fixed point appears as a configuration where the partition function includes the sum over all possible representation labels  that is the statistical weights associated to the different representation are equal ( modulo dimension factors that depend on conventions ) .",
    "the simplicity constraints select a certain subclass of representations and forbid the remaining ones .",
    "this leads to a breaking of topological invariance - as one should expect for 4d gravity .",
    "we will formulate the models in the holonomy representation developed in @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to generalize the models into the different directions which we have in mind .",
    "we will first describe the spin foam models , the switch to spin nets will be immediate . to start with",
    "we consider ( standard ) lattice gauge theories , which are defined on a ( oriented ) two  complex , i.e. a discrete structure with vertices @xmath6 , edges @xmath7 and faces ( plaquettes ) @xmath8 .",
    "the partition functions for lattice gauge theories are of the form [ p1 ] z=_e dg_e _ f _ f ( g_e_1 g_e_n ) .",
    "that is we associate group elements to the edges and for integration use the left and right invariant normalized measure ( assuming compact semi  simple lie groups ) . for a finite group this would be the normalized counting measure .",
    "the weights are associated to the faces and are given by class functions evaluated at the holonomy , i.e. the oriented product of group elements associated to the edges belonging to the face .",
    "@xmath3 theory ( the weak coupling limit of lattice gauge theory ) is obtained by setting the face weight @xmath9 equal to the delta function on the group .",
    "thus the partition function obtains only contribution from flat holonomies .",
    "the strong coupling limit is obtained with @xmath10 which weights all configurations ( in the group representation ) equally .",
    "standard lattice gauge theories involve non  trivial face weights , which depend on the coupling , but also on the area of the face .",
    "later - on we will refer to models which can be rewritten into such a form , i.e. with face weights only , as standard lattice gauge models .    to build models which do not depend on the background metric ( via the areas of the faces ) we proceed as in @xcite .",
    "this will lead to a space of models that encompasses current spin foam models .",
    "we split each group element in two , thus obtaining an assignment @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) of group elements per vertex ",
    "edge pair ( half edges ) .",
    "this step represents just a doubling of the number of variables , which however can be reabsorbed into variable redefinitions , that is the partition function is not changed .",
    "furthermore we associate group elements @xmath13 to every edge  face pair .",
    "these will be inserted into the face weights , which are taken as delta function .",
    "the partition function is given as [ p2 ] z=_(ve ) dg_ve _ ( ef ) dh_ef _ ( ef ) e(h_ef ) _ f ( g_v_1 e_1 h_e_1f g_e_1v_2 g_v_2 e_2 h_e_2f g_e_n v_1 ) .",
    "thus whereas the face holonomy @xmath14 is forced to be flat , the effective face holonomy @xmath15 can take non  trivial values .",
    "indeed we can introduce effective face weights [ p3 ] _f(g_e_n v_1 g_v_1 e_1 , g_e_1v_2",
    "g_v_2 e_2 ,  ) : = _ e f dh_ef _ e f e(h_ef ) _ f ( g_v_1 e_1 h_e_1f g_e_1v_2 g_v_2 e_2 h_e_2f g_e_n v_1 ) which are the analogs of the face weights in standard gauge theory .",
    "note however that ( a ) @xmath16 is not a class function in general and ( b ) depends not just on the ( effective ) face holonomy but in general on all pairs @xmath17 . thus the parameter space will be larger than for standard gauge theory , where it is given by the space of class functions over one copy of the group .",
    "the insertion of the @xmath18 weights describe the implementation of the so  called simplicity constraints , which are central to the dynamics of 4d spin foam models .",
    "indeed the group elements @xmath13 can be understood as lagrange multipliers , the integration over which enforces the constraints . in this sense",
    "different choices for @xmath18 parametrize different ways to implement the simplicity constraints ( basically the exponentiated version of the term @xmath19 in the plebanski lagrangian @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "current spin foam models ( barrett crane , eprl , bo @xcite ) can be described in this way with the following restriction on the edge functions @xmath18 :    * @xmath18 is invariant under conjugation under elements of a subgroup @xmath21 : @xmath22 .",
    "* @xmath18 is invariant under inversion of the argument : @xmath23 . *",
    "the barrett crane model has a special invariance , @xmath18 is invariant under left and right multiplication of elements of the subgroup @xmath24 : @xmath25 .",
    "note that if @xmath18 is invariant under conjugation from the full group @xmath26 , we can define an effective face weight @xmath16 , which is a class function and only depends on the effective face holonomy @xmath27 .",
    "thus this case reduces to standard lattice gauge theory ( where face weights might depend on the number of edges in a given face ) . as this subset of @xmath18-functions describes standard gauge theories we will be especially interested in @xmath18 functions which do not satisfy this property .",
    "also we see that choosing @xmath28 will give @xmath3 theory again , whereas @xmath29 gives the strong coupling limit . for @xmath30 , the subgroup under which the @xmath18function is invariant ,",
    "being a normal subgroup , one reduces to a ( standard ) gauge theory of the quotient group @xmath31",
    ".      we will now define analogue models to spin foams that live on 1complexes , i.e. graphs or nets , instead of 2complexes .",
    "these will be parametrized with the same algebraic ingredients , just that these ingredients are associated to building blocks which have one dimension less . in the spin foam models",
    "there are two group elements @xmath32 associated to every edge . for the spin net models we associate two group elements @xmath33 per vertex .",
    "furthermore we have variables @xmath13 associated to edge  face pairs in spin foams , which now become variables @xmath34 associated to vertex ",
    "edge pairs .",
    "thus the partition function for a spin net model will be defined as [ p4 ] z=_(v ) dg_vl dg_vr _ ( ve ) dh_ve _ ( ve ) e(h_ve ) _ e ( g^-1_vl h_ve g^-1_vr g_vr h_ve g_vl ) .",
    "we can define effective edge weights [ p5 ] _e(g_vlg^-1_vl , g_vr^-1 g_vr)=dh_1 dh_2 e(h_1 ) e(h_2 ) ( g^-1_vl h_1 g^-1_vr g_vr h_2 g_vl ) .",
    "we see that this effective edge weight is equal to an effective spin foam face weight for a face with two edges and hence two vertices .",
    "the role of the vertices in the spin foam face is taken over by the ( global ) indice @xmath35 , whereas the edges in the spin foam now correspond to the vertices .",
    "hence if we consider a larger spin net it corresponds to a spin foam with only two vertices named @xmath35 connected by many two valent faces .",
    "this configuration is also known as dipole .",
    "the local gauge symmetry of spin foams , which acts on the vertices , is replaced by the global symmetry of spin nets , represented by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    to obtain the partition function with effective face weights we integrate out the variables",
    "alternatively we can solve each of the delta functions associated to an edge @xmath7 for @xmath34 . doing a variable transformation and using the invariance of @xmath18 under inversion of",
    "the argument one arrives at a vertex model representation [ p6 ] z=_e dh_e _ v c_v(h_1,,h_n ) , where [ p7 ] c_v(h_1 , , h_n ) = dg_l dg_r _ i=1^n e(g_l h_i g_r ) , assuming @xmath38 edges adjacent to the vertex @xmath6 .",
    "vertex models are already in the form of a tensor network as in the partition function we sum/ integrate over variables associated to edges and the weight at an @xmath38valent vertex can be seen as tensor of rank @xmath38 .",
    "contraction over indices of tensors then corresponds to gluing vertices along edges and summing over the variables associated to the inner edges .",
    "the group averaging in ( [ p7 ] ) leads to a global symmetry under multiplication from the left and the right of all the open edges in a tensor network .",
    "now @xmath28 corresponds to the phase with @xmath26 order ( for the ising or potts models associated to the low temperature fixed point and having a @xmath39times degenerate ground state ) and @xmath29 to the disordered phase ( with unique ground state , associated to the high temperature fixed point ) .",
    "as mentioned before we have also the analog of the @xmath40 fixed point for @xmath30 a normal subgroup , i.e. an @xmath31group ordered phase .",
    "as we are interested in spin nets as analogues of spin foams we might refer to the fixed points in the spin foam interpretation , i.e. as @xmath3 ( low temperature fixed point ) or geometrically degenerate phases ( high temperature fixed point ) .      in the tensor network / vertex model representation we can associate hilbert spaces to the edges and understand the contraction of indices as taking the inner product of two functions ( i.e. two tensors with all other indices",
    "held fixed ) .",
    "in the group representation this hilbert space is @xmath41 , the space of square integrable functions over the group @xmath26 . for the class of groups we are considering",
    "this space is unitarily equivalent to [ p8 ] l^2(g ) & & _",
    "( v_v_^ * ) where the sum is over ( equivalence classes of ) all irreducible unitary representations and @xmath42 is the dual representation to @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath44 denotes the representation space associated to @xmath43 .",
    "thus the inner products are connected by .",

    "@xmath45 are magnetic indices , i.e. labelling the matrix elements of the representation matrix @xmath43 ( or a basis in @xmath44 and @xmath46 respectively ) and @xmath47 is the dimension of @xmath43 . to apply this transformation to the integrations associated to the spin net edges we have to decide how to assign the @xmath48 and @xmath49transformation to the adjacent vertices . for this reason we have to introduce an orientation for the edges .",
    "this leads to the partition function [ p11 ] z=__e , a_e , b_e _ v c_v ( \\{_e,a_e,b_e}_v = s(e ) , \\{_e^*,a_e,b_e}_v = t(e ) ) , where [ p12 ] & & c_v ( \\{_e , a_e , b_e}_s(e)=v , \\{_e^*,a_e , b_e}_t(e)=v)= + & & _",

    "the advantage of this representation is that it is more efficient than the group representation : only those entries which are allowed by the ( representation ) coupling rules are non  zero .",
    "going to the spin representation is also advantageous for the diagonalization of an associated matrix , that we will need to do as a step of our tensor network contraction scheme .",
    "furthermore , in order to perform this diagonalization we will change to a recoupling basis where the edges of the tensor are paired in two and where we take a tensor product of the corresponding representation spaces .    to be concrete",
    "we will specialize to four - valent tensors as depicted in figure [ fig:4-vertex ] .",
    "coupling the edges @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively we can express the vertex weight ( [ p12 ] ) in the recoupling basis .",
    "the transformation between the tensor in the recoupling basis @xmath54 and the original basis @xmath55 is given by [ p13 ] & & c_v ( \\{_e , a_e , b_e}_e=1,2 , \\{_e^*,a_e , b_e}_e=3,4 ) + & & = _ _ 5,_5,a_5,b_5 ( c^_1_2|_5_a_1 a_2 |a_5 |c^_1_2|_5_b_1 b_2|b_5 ) c(_1,_2,^*_3,^*_4 , _",

    "@xmath57 are clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients also defined in the appendix .",
    "@xmath58 is the group fourier transform of @xmath18 as used in ( [ p12 ] ) .",
    "here we assume multiplicity free groups , otherwise we have to introduce indices describing these additional intertwiner degrees of freedom .    .",
    "[ fig:4-vertex],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    let us describe the meaning of ( [ p13],[p14 ] ) in more detail .",
    "the tensor @xmath59 is invariant under group multiplication from the left and from the right .",
    "thus the fourier transformed tensor @xmath60 describes intertwiners @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "a basis of intertwiners is labeled by the representation labels @xmath63 and @xmath64 , corresponding to the channel of @xmath65 to both @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and @xmath66 to both @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus @xmath67 describes a combination of these intertwiners .",
    "an alternative viewpoint is to see @xmath67 as the matrix m_a=\\{_e , a_e , b_e}_e=1,2,b=\\{_e^*,a_e , b_e}_e=3,4 & = & c_v ( \\{_e , a_e , b_e}_e=1,2 , \\{_e^*,a_e , b_e}_e=3,4 ) expressed in a new ( recoupling ) basis .",
    "this new basis replaces the indices @xmath68 and @xmath69 by @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the matrix expressed in this basis is diagonal in the indices @xmath72 , i.e. [ p15 ] m_ab ~__5,_5 _ _5,_5 _ a_5,a_5 _ b_5,b_5 .",
    "this is due to the global symmetry of the model .",
    "hence we have blocks along the ` diagonal ' in the indices @xmath72 ( which therefore only appear once as variables in @xmath73 ) .",
    "these blocks do not actually depend on @xmath74 , therefore we can label blocks @xmath75 just by @xmath76 , and each of such blocks will appear @xmath77 times .    to diagonalize @xmath78 ( which is needed for the coarse graining scheme that we will employ ) , we just need to diagonalize the blocks , and any eigenvalue of a given block will have at least a degeneracy @xmath77 .",
    "the rows and columns of a given block @xmath75 can be indexed by pairs of representations @xmath79 such that @xmath80 include @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the decomposition into irreducible representations .",
    "if @xmath18 is a class function ( i.e. we are considering a standard lattice gauge theory type model ) , then these blocks will only have non  zero entries for @xmath81 and furthermore the blocks factorize , that is we have only one non  vanishing eigenvalue per block .",
    "thus we will have a maximum of @xmath82 eigenvalues for the matrix @xmath78 , which are partitioned in a certain degeneracy pattern .    for proper spin net models , non  vanishing blocks with @xmath83 will appear .",
    "furthermore the blocks might not factorize completely  the second equation in ( [ p14 ] ) implies a certain weaker factorization property . in this sense",
    "the spin net models are more complex than the standard models , as more eigenvalues ( or singular values ) will appear .",
    "indeed we will see that the number of eigenvalues will determine the size of the cut  off ( bond dimension ) that we have to choose , to make the numerical treatment feasible",
    ".    for the @xmath3 analog spin net , every block with @xmath84 is appearing , and each block has an eigenvalue ( after proper normalization ) @xmath85 ( which appears @xmath86 times ) .",
    "the imposition of simplicity constraints leads to + ( a ) some blocks with @xmath84 are vanishing , i.e. we have constraints on representation labels , + ( b ) some blocks with @xmath87 will appear , + ( c ) there might be more than one eigenvalue per block and the eigenvalues might not be equal to one .    the high temperature / disordered fixed point will just have the block @xmath88 with one non  vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "a tensor network is naturally suitable for coarse graining : we can partition a given network into regions such that the boundary of these regions cut only through edges ( and not through vertices ) . to every region we can associate a new effective tensor , which can be understood to provide the so  called amplitude map for this region in the language of @xcite .",
    "the rank of this effective tensor is given by the number of edges cutting through the boundary , and the tensor entries are given by the summation over all indices on the internal edges .",
    "we can partition the indices of the effective tensor and summarize the indices into a smaller number of ( super ) indices , which corresponds to summarize edges into effective edges .",
    "however in doing so , one notices that the range of indices is growing exponentially .    therefore , to keep the contraction of these tensors a feasible task we have to introduce some truncation .",
    "this truncation is implemented by isometric embeddings that act on the hilbert space associated to the edges .",
    "that is , given a partition function described as a tensor network z=_a , ",
    "t_abcd t_abad , we can introduce on any edge a unity in the form of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a unitary matrix .",
    "such an insertion leads a priori just to a field redefinition ( also known as weak gauge transformations in the context of vertex models ) .",
    "a truncation can be obtained by choosing @xmath90 such that it sorts the degrees of freedom represented in the index @xmath91 from more relevant to less relevant and then reducing the sum only to a certain range of the index @xmath91 ( defining the bond dimension @xmath92 ) .",
    "this choice should be done such that the approximation error in the partition function is minimal .",
    "@xmath93 can then be understood as an isometric embedding map .",
    "algorithms differ in how to make this choice precise and at which step in the iterative procedure one inserts the truncation",
    ". below we will present two possibilities .",
    "we want to point out another understanding of the truncation via the isometries @xmath90 , which is related to the concept of embedding maps and cylindrical consistency @xcite , as used in loop quantum gravity . in the description above we associated effective tensors to regions ( of space time in the spin foam interpretation ) .",
    "the effective indices are associated to the boundary and can be taken as variables in the boundary wave function or ( the dual ) amplitude map associated to the region .",
    "the map @xmath94 gives an isometric embedding mapping from a coarser to a finer boundary description .",
    "it can be interpreted in the following way : given a state in the coarse boundary hilbert space , how does a typical state look like in the finer boundary hilbert space ?",
    "such embeddings are pre  determined in the kinematical set up of loop quantum gravity and define the so  called kinematical ( continuum ) vacuum .",
    "these embeddings correspond to the high temperature/ strong coupling limit . thus getting information on the embeddings",
    "will tell us whether we should possibly change the kinematical embeddings to some dynamically determined embeddings .",
    "furthermore we can study how the maps @xmath95 respect the simplicity constraints  for the full gravitational models this will determine whether the coarse graining dynamically induced by the models corresponds to any geometric understanding of coarse graining or not .",
    "the choice of the maps @xmath90 is motivated by the following heuristic consideration .",

    "that is we assume that the tensor network can be split into two parts which are only connected by the edge labeled with the index @xmath96 . if we furthermore assume that @xmath97 we will minimize the summation error by performing a singular value decomposition ( svd ) on @xmath78 [ d2 ] m_aa= _ i v_ai _ i ( u^)_ia , and taking only the @xmath92 largest singular values ( sv s ) into account .",
    "the embedding maps are then given by the @xmath95 matrices in ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "thus the relative error is of the order @xmath98 , assuming that the ( by definition positive ) sv s are ordered from the largest to the smallest one .",
    "of course this procedure is not practical as one has to contract almost all indices in the tensor network to define @xmath78 .",

    "also instead of performing a svd of a matrix one can attempt to find an analogue decomposition for tensors directly @xcite .",
    "however , having in mind applications to more and more complicated models we will rather go for the simplest algorithms .    the main question is whether a truncation to a finite bond dimension leads to a good approximation or not .",
    "this is connected with the entanglement ( in the boundary wave function ) between regions , which scales with the number of edges ( times the bond dimension ) crossing the boundary , see for instance @xcite for a discussion .",
    "we mainly employed the gu - wen contraction scheme @xcite , which is a variant for a four  valent lattice of the original algorithm for a hexagonal lattice @xcite . here the four  valent tensor network is first rewritten into a three  valent tensor network .",

    "the truncation is then performed on this connecting edge and the resulting three ",

    "this scheme leads qualitatively to the same results as the gu - wen scheme ( is in 2d however less computationally effective ) .",
    "here we employed this scheme to determine and interpret the embedding isometries for which we needed only lower bond dimensions ( @xmath104 ) .    .",
    "from its svd , @xmath105 , we extract the embedding map @xmath106 , which is graphically represented on the right .",

    "note that the indices carried by thicker edges run from 1 to the bond dimension @xmath92 considered in the svd that determines the embedding maps .",
    "[ fig : coarse],scaledwidth=80.0% ]      the tensor network in the spin representation has special properties due to the global invariance under left and right group multiplication .",
    "it pays off to design a coarse graining algorithm that preserves this symmetry explicitly @xcite , for a number of reasons    * we discussed that the singular values or eigenvalues will typically be degenerate .",
    "the symmetry preserving algorithm will count a set of degenerate eigenvalues ( coming from the same intertwiner channel ) only once into the bond dimension , which is usually fixed from the outset .",
    "thus we can obtain a larger effective bond dimension .",
    "this saving effect scales with the dimensions of the representations involved .",

    "the contraction of tensors is the most time consuming effect .",
    "again this time saving effect scales with the dimension of the representations involved .",
    "furthermore , applying recoupling rules , one can identify from the outside combinations of representation labels that will not contribute to the contraction or will lead to zero entries in the resulting tensor .",

    "* this algorithm will associate singular values to representation and intertwiner labels .",
    "we can also reconstruct the embedding isometries with the help of these representation labels .",
    "this information will characterize the fixed points .",

    " valent tensors are expanded into contractions of three  valent ones , it will be natural to use recoupling theory , where three  valent vertices are the basic building blocks .",

    "in the scheme that we have implemented , this bond dimension does not take the multiplicity of the blocks into account , that is a singular value from a given block is counted only once into the bond dimension .",

    "[ fig : nongauge - b0],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in section [ emb ] we will describe the actual fixed point tensor appearing at this additional fixed point in more detail .",
    "the fine tuning , that is necessary to reach this fixed point ( for lower bond dimension ) indicates that unstable directions exist around this fixed point .",
    "the fact that we do not flow to this fixed point for higher bond dimension might then be due to these unstable directions which are taken into account for higher bond dimension , but were neglected for the lower bond dimension .",
    "these unstable directions lead to a flow either to the high temperature or low temperature phase .",

    "this phase transition line might have even more structure , as the appearance of the additional fixed point for low bond dimension , indicates .    the number of iterations necessary to reach a fixed point increases near a phase transition line . as we will comment below this",

    "in particular the so  called face weights influence greatly whether divergencies appear @xcite or not .",
    "monte carlo simulations , which have been performed with the bc model @xcite , showed similarly that it is essential to fine - tune these weights in order not to flow immediately to a geometrically degenerate phase ( which corresponds here to the high temperature / disordered fixed point ) or to the @xmath3 phase ( here low temperature / ordered phase ) .",
    "standard lattice gauge theories are just formulated with face weights , hence the fine tuning can be understood as making sure that the model is not dominated by the dynamics imposed from these face weights , which drives the system either to low or high temperature .",
    "surprisingly we found in our analogue model that there might be more structure hidden exactly at the transition between these behaviours .",
    "however , as a note of caution , in our case the models on the phase transition line can not be understood as arising from the barrett crane analogue model by just changing the ( analogue ) face weights . to reach the phase transition line we also need to deform the simplicity constraints of the bc model , i.e. the @xmath18function is changed in a way , that can not be absorbed by changing the ( analogue ) face weights only .",

    "moreover one notices that the sign representation @xmath185 does not appear at all .",
    "it will help to understand first the @xmath4 ordered fixed point @xmath219 ( in the representation basis ) .",

    "one can contract two three  valent tensors in two different ways to obtain a four  valent tensor ( the two ways are connected by a so  called 22 pachner move ) , however both ways will result in the same tensor , see figure [ fig : pachner ] .",

    "interestingly we found a fixed point where this sign representation does not appear either .",
    "this model is however outside the space of initial models we considered .",
    "we leave the generalization to other groups and the definition of corresponding spin foam models for future research .",
    "for a coarse graining procedure one usually has to specify a map from finer configurations to coarser ones . in the tensor network scheme one rather has to specify ( isometric ) embedding maps from the set of coarser configurations into the set of finer ones .",
    "this is due to the fact that the procedure is not just a coarse graining of the bulk , but can be interpreted as coarse graining systems with boundary .",
    "the considerations that led to the density matrix renormalization group @xcite show that the treatment of boundary conditions is indeed crucial .",
    "the embedding maps in the tensor network scheme describe how coarser boundary data are mapped into finer ones .",
    "the finer boundary data describe a region with also more fine grained bulk data . using the pull back of the embedding we can map the amplitudes ( also known as boundary wave function @xcite ) for the fine grained regions to amplitudes for regions with coarser boundary data , see @xcite for more explanation and a corresponding classical procedure .",
    "one can also try to read the embedding maps ` backwards ' and interpreted these as coarse graining maps , i.e. as mappings from the finer configurations to the coarser ones .",
    "however in this case certain finer configurations will be mapped to zero , one has therefore to be careful with this interpretation .",
    "the embedding maps are chosen due to dynamical considerations : the association of finer to coarser variables is constructed such that the most relevant modes ( specified by the singular values ) are selected .",
    "the map @xmath95 in ( [ d2 ] ) provides such a map @xmath232 , which allows the coarse graining of two edges into one edge .",
    "the representation labels for spin foam models carry a geometric interpretation , i.e. for the full models the representation labels specify the eigenvalues of the area operator .",
    "one important question for the consistency of the models will be whether the embedding maps induced by the dynamics lead to geometric sensible results",
    ". more specifically we can ask whether the simplicity constraints hold also for the coarse grained models or will be weakened .",
    "the embedding maps are well known in the loop quantum gravity context : they appear in the construction of the loop quantum gravity kinematical hilbert space via projective methods @xcite .",
    "this allows to construct the continuum hilbert space out of a family of hilbert spaces based on discrete structures ( graphs ) .",
    "the embeddings are essential and allow to pull back observables from the continuum hilbert space to the hilbert space based on an appropriate graph .",
    "this construction is however performed on the kinematical level and based on the kinematical vacuum .",
    "all geometric operators have vanishing expectation values in this kinematical vacuum , i.e. the measure describing this state is concentrated on the trivial representation ( which leads to vanishing expectation values for geometric operators ) .",
    "this kinematical vacuum corresponds therefore to the @xmath4unordered phase / high temperature fixed point .",
    "one would expect a different vacuum to arise from the dynamics of a quantum gravity model .",
    "this can be either around a phase transition with non  trivial fixed points .",
    "starting from a point in the phase diagram near a phase transition the number of iterations to reach a fixed point will increase .",
    "in particular the embedding maps will be almost constant over a large number of iterations .",
    "scale invariance emerges - the description of how to map coarse triangulation to finer triangulations does not change over a range of scales ( defined by the number of iterations ) . in this range",
    "the embedding maps will therefore not depend on the iteration number .",
    "the corresponding embedding maps can be understood to define ( the continuum limit of ) the ` dynamical vacuum ' as they encode the following information : given a coarse configuration what are the most likely configurations of the fine degrees of freedom ?",
    "apart from the phase transitions we can also consider the fixed points in table ( [ table1 ] ) with an @xmath4 , @xmath178 or @xmath181 order .",
    "one will notice that the singular values for these fixed points are all equal to unity .",
    "thus the splitting of the four  valent fixed point tensors into the three  valent fixed point tensors is given by the isometries itself . in the previous section [ ffp ] we discussed this splitting for the four  valent fixed points , as it defines three  valent triangulation independent models . thus the embedding maps are actually given by the three  valent fixed point tensors discussed in section [ ffp ] .",
    "the embedding maps act on @xmath233 .",
    "two factors of the embedding maps are therefore given by the clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients for the @xmath43 and for the @xmath234 labels .",
    "this just follows from the fact that we consider a model with global symmetry and implement a coarse graining procedure that respects this global symmetry .",

    "it is often suggested to regulate this sum by a ( simple ) cut  off or a heat kernel .",

    "the implementation of simplicity constraints leads to singular values with @xmath193 .",

    "this would lead to a large variation of physics with scale , whereas one rather might expect a ( nearly or exactly ) triangulation and therefore coarse graining invariant model .",
    "the latter feature would be expected due to the notion of diffeomorphism symmetry , that is conjectured to be equivalent to triangulation independence in discrete models @xcite . in contrast models near a ( second order )",
    "phase transition need a large number of iterations to converge to a fixed point .",
    "the coarse graining flow shows a plateau like behaviour : we have seen that the isometric embedding maps and the singular values are constant along a certain range of iterations . in this sense",
    "it is encouraging that ( a ) a phase transition occurs in the space of models we considered and ( b ) that this phase transition is ` near ' the bc analogue model .",
    "the existence of an additional fixed point outside the space of models we considered suggest to take into account even a more general space of models .",
    "interestingly this fixed point respects the simplicity constraints for the bc model and at the same time is triangulation invariant .",
    "we will leave it for future research to investigate whether such a fixed point can be also found for other groups and models .    in this work we performed several simplifications , to be able to reach explicit numerical results .",
    "future work should aim to go back to the full models , using as guidance the lessons learned here .",
    "as already mentioned , quantum groups @xcite at roots of unity suggest themselves as another means to deal with only finite summations . as quantum groups",
    "are suggested to take into account a cosmological constant , this would allow spin net models which in their algebraic data fully agree with the gravitational spin foam models .",
    "the coarse graining algorithm employed here , allowed the definition of corresponding quantum group spin net models @xcite .",
    "we mentioned that the results for the @xmath4 models should be similar to the results for the @xmath2 quantum group as the recoupling symbols agree modulo signs .",
    "dominate , these signs will not matter , as the coarse graining formulas involve a recoupling symbol for the @xmath43 and the @xmath234 values , which square for @xmath256 . ]    for going to higher dimensions and for applications to spin foams versions of the anisotropic algorithm explained in figures [ fig : embbeding],[fig : coarse ] might be the most straightforward one to adopt .",
    "indeed it leads to encouraging results for 3d spin net models @xcite .",
    "given the state of knowledge on the phase structure of spin foams , another important point is to develop and test reliable approximations and truncations .",
    "we suggested that the parametrization of the degrees of freedom by pairs of representation labels @xmath191 employed here might capture the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the coarse graining formulas ( [ p26],[p27 ] ) can be taken as a starting point to investigate more severe truncations . here starting with the initial space of models ,",
    "one will find that after one round of iterations , one has left the space of initial models .",
    "thus one can either extend the space of models or find a way to project back to the initial space of models .",
    "the second possibility would give a iteration formula , defining a coarse graining flow .",
    "such a truncation has been suggested for the abelian models in @xcite and leads to the migdal kadanoff coarse graining formula .",
    "this formula is known to fail giving i.e. the order of phase transitions correctly .",
    "it however requires much less work for its implementation and thus is useful to generate conjectures on the phase structure of the full models .",
    "the migdal kadanoff coarse graining formula can indeed be applied to the @xmath4 models without non  trivial simplicity constraints ( i.e. for parameters @xmath169 ) for which it reproduces the three phases we found and the phase transitions .",
    "the question would be to extend this to the models with non  trivial simplicity constraints . this would allow to generate a preliminary impression of the phase space structure for the higher dimensional models , that would have to be confirmed with more reliable methods , for instance tensor network algorithms .",
    "another possibility is to study linearizations of the coarse graining formulas ( [ p26],[p27 ] ) around the fixed points we found , which would specify more in detail the relevant and irrelevant directions .",
    "here we summarize some basics on clebsch  gordan coefficients and recoupling symbols .    given three irreducible unitary representations @xmath258 of the group @xmath26 , which couple to the trivial representation , we define the clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients by [ app1 ] |_3 a_3 & = & _ a_1,a_2 c^_1_2|_3_a_1 a_2|a_3    @xmath259 , labeled by a magnetic index @xmath260 , in each of the representation spaces @xmath261 .",

    "thus we can go to the recoupling basis @xmath268 and @xmath269 respectively . in this way we obtain tensor components in the recoupling basis @xmath270 and @xmath271 .    for fixed @xmath272 we will again obtain an intertwining map between the representation spaces involved . according to schur s",
    "lemma this map is the zero map for @xmath273 and proportional to the identity map for @xmath274 .",
    "thus we will just need to consider the tensor components for @xmath274 and @xmath275 and moreover we know that the dependence on @xmath276 will be trivial .",
