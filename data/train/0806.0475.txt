    "the use of charm quarkonia produced in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) probes has a rich tradition , starting with the seminal paper by matsui and satz  @xcite , which predicted the suppression of @xmath4 production in a qgp . at rhic , phenix has measured the @xmath4 production in a - a collisions at @xmath5 . the suppression as a function of the number of participants",
    "is found to be similar to the one at lower energy at sps  @xcite even though the energy in the center of mass differs by an order of magnitude , leading to different cold nuclear effects ( cnm ) as well as the melting of other excited charmonium states . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger energy and charm quark densities created at rhic may allow regeneration of the @xmath4 via recombination of uncorrelated charm quarks during the collision  @xcite . moreover , phenix recently published results  @xcite indicate that the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 is smaller at forward rapidity than at mid - rapidity .",
    "this may come from the amount of cnm effects that may be different for each rapidity  @xcite , or from coalescence of charm quarks which would enhance the @xmath4 production further at mid - rapidity .",
    "studying other observables , such as the azimuthal anisotropy of the produced particles might give additional information on how these particles are produced  @xcite .",
    "in non - central heavy ion collisions , the distribution of the colliding matter is not isotropic around the beam direction . in the thermodynamic picture ,",
    "the asymmetric distribution of initial energy density causes a pressure gradient which is larger in the shortest direction of the ellipsoidal medium .",
    "therefore , the momentum distribution of produced particles can also be anisotropic .",
    "phenix measured a positive elliptic flow for heavy ( c , b ) quarks via the study of so called non photonic electrons for a transverse momentum higher than 1  gev / c  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 are produced from @xmath7 recombination in a deconfined phase  @xcite , they should inherit their flow . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath4 directly produced by hard qcd processes early in the collision can not be sensitive to collective phenomena . therefore measuring a positive @xmath4 elliptic flow",
    "would indicate the level of recombination that takes part in the @xmath4 production mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow is quantified by the second fourier coefficient @xmath2 of the @xmath4 azimuthal angle distribution  @xcite : @xmath8\\ ] ] with @xmath9 the azimuthal angle of the particle with respect to an arbitrary axis ( oj ) , and @xmath10 , the reaction plane angle ( plane defined by the impact parameter vector and the beam axis ) with respect to ( oj ) .    the reaction plane of each event is measured using the azimuthal distribution of a limited subset of particles produced in the collision .",
    "its resolution depends on the number of particles detected , the strength of their flow , and the resolution of the detector .",
    "therefore , the elliptic flow measurement is corrected so that this resolution is reflected on the true @xmath2 measurement : @xmath11 .",
    "+ starting from 2007 , phenix uses two new reaction plane detectors ( rxnp ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rxnp_fig ] ) to measure the reaction plane of each collision following methods described in  @xcite .",
    "it improves the reaction plane resolution , and thus gives a correction @xmath12 twice better than what was achieved previously with the beam beam counters ( bbc ) , or what can be measured with the muon piston calorimeters ( mpc ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rxnp ] ) .",
    "reaction plane resolution as a function of centrality , measured with the rxnp ( top ) , the mpc ( middle ) , or the bbc ( squares ) . ]",
    "reaction plane resolution as a function of centrality , measured with the rxnp ( top ) , the mpc ( middle ) , or the bbc ( squares ) . ]    the phenix experiment is designed to detect heavy quarkonia at forward rapidity ( @xmath13 ) via the @xmath14 decay channel and at mid - rapidity ( @xmath15 ) via the @xmath16 decay channel  @xcite . at forward rapidity ,",
    "cathode strip tracking chambers and alternating layers of steel absorber and iarocci tubes allow muons to be identified and tracked over an acceptance of @xmath17 . at mid - rapidity drift chambers , ring imaging erenkov detectors and electromagnetic calorimeters",
    "are used to detect electrons in two arms covering @xmath18 each . during the 2007 run at the relativistic heavy ion collider ,",
    "phenix recorded au+au collisions and @xmath19 events are analysed here ( 42% of the total luminosity ) .    the forward measurement of @xmath4 elliptic flow benefits from three times more @xmath4 than at mid - rapidity but with a poorer resolution ( 150  mev vs. 80  mev ) and signal over background ratio ( 1/6 vs. 1/3 ) .",
    "in addition , at mid - rapidity both rxnp detectors can be used leading to an optimal measurement of @xmath2 . a challenge to",
    "the forward rapidity measurement comes from the overlapping acceptances of the rxnp with the muon arms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rxnp_fig ] ) .",
    "the two muons and all possible accompanying fragmentation products might go through the rxnp , which may introduce non - flow effects and auto - correlations between the reaction plane and the @xmath4 azimuthal angle . to limit this bias on the @xmath2 measurement , the best configuration uses the rxnp located in the muon arm opposite to the @xmath4 .",
    "the drawback is that the resolution of the reaction plane measurement is worse than when using both forward and backward rxnp detectors . on the other hand , using both rxnp or restricting to the one where the muons go ( and thus possibly biasing the measurement ) could be used to estimate the magnitude of the bias .",
    "@xmath4 @xmath2 results are still underway at forward rapidity even though the @xmath6 has been measured  @xcite and is compatible with published results  @xcite .",
    "the method consists in extracting the number of @xmath4 counts in bins of @xmath9-@xmath10 , transverse momentum @xmath20 and centrality using mixed event background subtraction .",
    "the @xmath21 is extracted from the fit of the invariant yield with eq .",
    "[ v2 fourrier ] in each @xmath20 and centrality bin , and is corrected with @xmath22 . a similar method was also applied for mid - rapidity , but the result presented here uses an alternate method based on the additivity of the elliptic flow  @xcite , which provides a more precise handling of the background elliptic flow : @xmath23 @xmath24 is the @xmath2 of the foreground , from same event unlike sign pairs , in [ 2.9 , 3.3 ]  gev/@xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the number of counts in the @xmath4 mass range from mixed event pairs .",
    "@xmath27 is the number of measured @xmath4 , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the contribution from the combinatorial background estimated using event mixing , and @xmath30 the remaining contribution of the background ( physical processes or uncertainty on the mixed background normalization ) fitted with an exponential .",
    "@xmath31 is fitted outside the @xmath4 mass to @xmath32 , and extrapolated to [ 2.9 , 3.3 ]  gev/@xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath2 at mid - rapidity for 42% of the run-7 statistics is shown for three @xmath20 bins in the centrality range [ 20,60% ] on fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] . statistical errors and point to point uncorrelated systematic errors coming from the signal extraction are drawn with vertical bars .",
    "systematic errors correlated between the @xmath20 bins appear with boxes .",
    "these errors account for the @xmath2 extraction and are estimated by the difference on the @xmath2 value when fitting with eq .",
    "[ v2 fourrier ] or using directly @xmath33",
    ". they also account for the background @xmath2 shape , estimated with a fit to the background distributions with a constant , linear or quadratic polynomial . global systematic errors to account for the technique used to determine the reaction plane angle and resolution are written on the figure .",
    "@xmath4 @xmath2 at @xmath15 for [ 20,60% ] in centrality , as a function of @xmath20 , using 42% of 2007 au+au statistics , with some predictions .",
    "error bars are statistical errors uncorrelated point to point , boxes are systematic errors correlated between each @xmath20 bins , and a global systematic error is written ( see text).,width=529 ]    the measurements shown on fig .  [",
    "fig : v2 ] have big uncertainties mostly due to lack of statistics and to the poor signal / background ratio .",
    "the @xmath2 integrated over all @xmath20 is compatible with 0 : @xmath34% ) .",
    "some theoretical scenarios appear on fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] to illustrate different production mechanisms predictions . when only initially produced @xmath4 ( no regeneration ) are considered  @xcite with normal suppression from inelastic collisions with spectators and anomalous suppression from collisions with gluons in a qgp , the prediction is slightly positive but reaches at most 0.02 for @xmath35 .",
    "models with partial or full charm quark or charmonium thermalization should have larger @xmath2 than this .",
    "the addition of recombination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 during or at the term of the partonic phase should enhance the charmonium production and affect the elliptic flow .",
    "for instance , full regeneration of the @xmath4 at freeze out is studied in @xcite and in a transport model description in @xcite .",
    "those models predict a steep increase of the @xmath4 @xmath2 , reaching 0.2 at @xmath38  gev / c .",
    "if the production is a mixture of regeneration and initial production as in @xcite , the predicted @xmath2 has a more moderate slope and reaches intermediate values .",
    "finally , comover interactions  @xcite leave the @xmath4s with no @xmath2 within errors , slightly positive at @xmath39  gev / c , and negative at @xmath40  gev / c .",
    "the mid - rapidity @xmath4 @xmath2 measurement obtained with less than half of the potential 2007 statistics does not allow to distinguish between predictions .",
    "work is ongoing to process the remaining statistics and to reduce the systematic uncertainties at mid and forward rapidities .",
    "future rhic au+au runs will provide more statistics which is crucial for this measurement .",
    "the experimental study of @xmath4 @xmath2 will be complementary to other studies of @xmath4 suppression and will provide valuable information about the early stage of high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
