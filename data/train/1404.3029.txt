    "etc_. moreover , various 1d systems are also proposed to host mfs.@xcite importantly , high magnetic field , which breaks the time reversal symmetry , is essential for the appearance of mfs in most of these strategies .",

    ", topological insulators driven by external time - dependent perturbations have stimulated great scientific interests.@xcite specifically , for the time - periodic driven systems , it is convenient to use floquet theory to characterize their topological phases.@xcite for example , with shinning spatial modulating irradiation on a semiconductor quantum well , which is initially in the trivial phase , topological nontrivial edge states can be induced in floquet bands.@xcite additionally , with circularly polarized light , a nontrivial gap is opened and edge states emerge in hexagonal lattices , such as graphene and silicene.@xcite importantly , mikael et al . , detected photonic floquet edge states in photonic lattices experimentally.@xcite and , with the help of time - resolved arpes , wang et al . , have observed the floquet states on the surface of a topological insulator.@xcite    more recently , a new concept of floquet majorana fermions ( fmfs ) is brought in cold - atom systems , such as driven cold - atom quantum wires@xcite and so on .",
    "furthermore , fmfs can also encode quantum information when the periodic driving potential does not break fermion parity conservation.@xcite however , there are few studies focusing on fmfs in condensed matter systems .",
    "especially , with circularly polarized light , hexagonal lattices have been proved to be topological nontrival systems hosting floquet edge states.@xcite one natural question is whether fmfs can exist in those systems .",
    "in fact , the hexagonal lattices possess unique advantages due to the existence of antiferromagnetic order",
    ". in particular , the antiferromagnetic phase can coexist with superconductivity , breaking the time - reversal symmetry without external magnetic field .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that there exists the layer - antiferromagnetic(laf ) phase in bilayer graphene.@xcite and the antiferromagnetic phase has been also theoretically predicted existing in monolayer hexagonal lattices , such as graphene.@xcite considering these advantages , the hexagonal lattices provide a promising platform for realizing fmfs .    in this work ,",

    "based on the effective hamiltonian , we calculate the chern numbers  the number of chiral floquet majorana edge states to be 8 , 4 and 0 , respectively , corresponding to the three different topological phases . moreover , the number of those edge states is also confirmed by solving energy spectra in the ribbon geometry .",
    "notably , in narrow ribbons , due to the finite size confinement , there exist another two cases with edge states numbers 6 and 2 . furthermore",
    ", this proposal of generating chiral fmfs is generalized to other hexagonal lattices , such as the single - layer graphene and silicene . in silicene ,",

    "the bilayer graphene with laf is put in proximity to an s - wave superconductor . meanwhile , a beam of right - handed circularly polarized light is projected perpendicularly to the plane of bilayer graphene ( left - handed rotation can be discussed similarly ) . thus , the effective tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath10 can be written as : @xmath11 \\nonumber\\\\        &    & + v\\sum_{i , s}\\ [ s(b^\\dagger_{i , s,1}b_{i , s,1}-b^\\dagger_{i , s,2}b_{i , s,2})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath13 on site @xmath14 in layer @xmath15 on sublattice @xmath2 ( an equivalent definition is used for sublattice b ) , as shown in fig.1(b ) . in @xmath10 , the first two terms denote intrinsic hopping in bilayer graphene , where @xmath16 in the first term is the nearest - neighbor hopping energy , and @xmath5 in the second term stands for the hopping energy between atom @xmath6 and @xmath7 in different layers .",

    "the off - resonant light modifies the electron via virtual photon absorption process , and results in a chiral next nearest - neighbour hopping ( see app.a for details ) , where @xmath17 denotes the next nearest - neighbor hopping energy , and @xmath18 corresponds to clockwise ( anti - clockwise ) hopping . for graphene systems , the off - resonant condition requires photon energies larger than band width , which lies in the range of soft x - ray regime.@xcite recently , the circularly light induced gap has been detected in the surface state of topological insulator , which is consistent with the effective model.@xcite the last term in eq.1 stands for laf , which is spontaneously generated by electron - electron interaction in bilayer graphene around half filling , and @xmath19 is the laf strength.@xcite the laf and superconductivity come from different orgin , and may coexist in the interface graphene layers .",
    "previously , the coexistent of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity has been investigated theoretically and experimentally.@xcite in general , the circularly polarized light gives rise to the nontrivial topology , and the laf term lifts the spin degeneracy .",
    "the combination of these two effects leads to abundant topological phases in hexagonal lattices as discussed in the following parts .    considering the proximity effect of an s - wave superconductor as shown in fig.1(a ) , the bogoliubov@xmath0de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian of the proposed system can be obtained in the momentum space : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 denotes the superconducting order parameter and @xmath23 . here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for @xmath26 atom in upper and lower layer , respectively .",

    "firstly , we investigate the topological phase diagram of the proposed system by calculating the topological invariant : chern number .",
    "since the topological invariant can not change without closing the bulk energy gap , the gap - closing condition of @xmath32 gives out possible topological phase transition points .",
    "based on the diagonalization of @xmath32 in eq.2 , we find the bulk energy band closes exactly at the dirac points . in specific , the energy levels at dirac points are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which means the bulk energy gap closes at two critical conditions : @xmath35 and @xmath36 . consequently , there may exist three topological phases which can be distinguished by different chern numbers .     respectively .",

    "that is to say , one can change @xmath17 by tuning the amplitude @xmath2 or frequency @xmath3 of the induced circularly polarized light , in order to precisely make the system go through three topological phases in experiments with fixed laf amplitude @xmath19 and superconducting order parameter @xmath22 . considering the band - width of bilayer graphene ,",
