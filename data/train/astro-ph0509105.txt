    "general relativity ( gr ) is the least tested theory of the four fundamental forces of nature .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath2 massive black hole ( mbh ) in the galactic center ( gc ) and the stars around it ( @xcite ; @xcite ) provide a unique laboratory for detecting post - newtonian ( pn ) effects and for probing gr ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "long - term astrometric and spectroscopic monitoring of stars orbiting the mbh allow the derivation of their orbital elements .",
    "the stars are observed at periapse distances as small as @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) with velocities as high as @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the relativistic parameter at periapse , @xmath7 is a few times higher than that on the surface of a white dwarf .",
    "this is an unexplored regime of celestial mechanics . for comparison , the high precision confirmation of gr predictions in the hulse - taylor binary pulsar ( psr 1913 + 16 ) was for masses of @xmath8 with @xmath9 at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that although some accretion processes occur at @xmath11 , the complex physics of accretion and its many uncertainties severely limit the usefulness of accretion emission as a probe of gr .    at present all the observed orbits can be adequately modeled in terms of newtonian physics . with improved resolution ,",
    "higher precision and a longer baseline , deviations from keplerian orbits may be detectable . in this _",
    "letter _ we examine the future detectability of leading order ( @xmath0 ) pn effects with _ existing _ instrumental capabilities .",
    "we show that such effects can be detected in the observed stellar doppler shift curves ( note that the doppler shift is no longer equivalent to the radial velocity when pn effects are included ) .    the measurement of stellar proper motions and accelerations in the inner arcsecond ( @xmath12 ) of the gc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) preceded by more than a decade the measurement of radial velocities for these stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , most theoretical studies of the detectability of pn orbital effects focused on those that affect the proper motions , such as the periapse shift ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , with the advent of adaptive - optics - assisted ir imaging spectroscopy ( e.g. vlt / sinfoni ; @xcite ) , it is now the observed doppler shifts rather than the proper motions that provide the tightest constraints on deviations from newtonian orbits .",
    "the current quality of stellar spectroscopy in the gc allows the determination of the doppler shift , @xmath13 , to within @xmath14 , or @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed doppler shift curve @xmath16 can be expanded in terms of the 3d source velocity @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the light emission and arrival times , respectively , @xmath20 as shown in ",
    "[ s : effects ] , two effects contribute to the 2nd - order term ( @xcite ) , @xmath21 : the special relativistic transverse doppler effect , with @xmath22 , and the gr gravitational redshift , with @xmath23 .",
    "it then follows that the 2nd - order pn effects are detectable with existing instruments , since @xmath24 .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : effects ] we discuss the properties of the @xmath0 terms and the implications for their detectability . in  [ s : simulations ] we demonstrate the detectability of these effects by simulated observations .",
    "we discuss our results in ",
    "[ s : conclusion ] .",
    "when @xmath25 the orbit is keplerian to a good approximation and the orbital energy equation ( the vis viva equation ) is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the orbital semi - major axis .",
    "for an eccentric orbit @xmath28 and so near periapse @xmath29 .",
    "two effects contribute to the @xmath0 term of the doppler shift expansion ( eq . [ e : z ] ) .",
    "one is the gr gravitational redshift , @xmath30 which also contributes a constant to the 0th order term of the @xmath13-expansion , @xmath31 ( eq . [ e : b2 ] ) .",
    "the second is the full relativistic doppler shift of a moving source seen by an observer at rest ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the angle between the velocity vector and the line of sight .",
    "the newtonian doppler shift , @xmath34 , is the 1st- order term in the @xmath13-expansion .",
    "the special - relativistic transverse doppler effect , @xmath35 , contributes to the 2nd - order term in the @xmath13-expansion .",
    "the light travel time from the star to the observer changes with the orbital phase in an inclined orbit .",
    "we include this effect , known as the rmer delay , by relating the observed doppler shift @xmath16 to the actual velocity at emission @xmath36/c\\}$ ] , @xmath37 is the angle between @xmath38 and the line of sight and @xmath39 is the distance to the mbh .",
    "it is crucial to do so because the phase dependence of the light travel time also contributes to the 2nd order term ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational redshift and the transverse doppler shift affect only the measured doppler shifts , but not the astrometric proper motions .",
    "these are treated here as newtonian , since astrometric pn effects are below the current astrometric precision .",
    "figure [ f : effects ] shows the 2nd - order pn effects that are predicted for the star s2 , based on the orbital elements derived for it from a newtonian fit to the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "as expected , the pn effects near periapse are a few percents of the total measured doppler shift , since for @xmath40,@xmath41    @xcite studied the detectability of the gravitational redshift and transverse doppler shift effects in binary pulsar timing data .",
    "they show that radial velocity data alone are not enough to detect these effects , since to leading order they can be absorbed in a purely newtonian solution by very small modifications of the orbital elements @xmath42 ( radial velocity amplitude ) , @xmath43 ( argument of the periapse ) and @xmath44 ( the line - of - sight center - of - mass velocity ) . to break the degeneracy they suggest using the gr periapse shift ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "while this may be feasible for a binary pulsar , where the orbital period is very short and the timing is extremely accurate , a different approach is required for the orbits around the galactic mbh . in this context",
    "there are two possibilities to break the degeneracy .",
    "one is to use the astrometric data , which can constrain both @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "another is to use the fact that the stars all orbit a common center - of - mass and share the same @xmath44 .",
    "thus , a combined solution of the astrometric and radial - velocity orbits for all the stars can break the degeneracy and reveal the 2nd - order pn effects .",
    "best - fit newtonian orbital elements and their errors are usually obtained by a @xmath46 fit of newtonian orbits to the data .",
    "we extend this procedure by introducing a new parameter , @xmath47 , which quantifies the strength of the 2nd - order pn effects , so that the gr gravitational redshift term is parametrized as @xmath48 and the full relativistic doppler term as @xmath49 for newtonian physics , @xmath50 , whereas for pn gr , @xmath51 .",
    "values other than zero or one are also possible in principle and would indicate deviations from the predictions of both theories .",
    "the @xmath47 parametrization is chosen here for its simplicity , but is neither general nor unique .",
    "for example , it arbitrarily presupposes that deviations from gr ( expressed by @xmath52 ) are related in a specific way to deviations from special relativity ( expressed by @xmath53 ) .",
    "if future data quality or candidate alternative theories warrant it , the fit procedure can be easily generalized to include multiple pn parameters .",
    "we looked for evidence of pn effects in the existing orbital data by applying the pn fit procedure to the orbits of the 6 stars s1 , s2 , s8 , s12 , s13 and s14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain a best - fit value of @xmath54 , which appears to exclude pn gr at a @xmath55 confidence level and newtonian physics at a @xmath56 confidence level .",
    "the number of currently available doppler shift measurements is very small , and the astrometric data is not homogeneous . it is conceivable that these results are strongly influenced by systematic effects .",
    "future observations will settle this question .",
    "we performed a suite of simulations to investigate the detectability of 2nd - order pn effects in the doppler shift data with existing instrumental capabilities and with realistic astrometric and spectroscopic precision . since the relative strength of the pn effects scales with @xmath57 ( eq . [ e : pn ] ) , we focus on stars that pass through deep ( high velocity ) periapse during the monitoring period .",
    "this has actually happened in the period 20002003 ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ f : orbits ] ) for the two stars s2 ( with period @xmath58 , eccentricity @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) and s14 ( with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "unfortunately , at that time precise stellar spectroscopy of the inner gc was just becoming available , and only a few doppler measurements of s2 were obtained ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to make the simulations realistic",
    ", we used the @xmath66 orbits that were actually monitored and solved by @xcite .",
    "we generated synthetic orbits based on the published newtonian orbital elements .",
    "the simulated datasets consisted of one observation per month ( @xmath67 astrometric coordinates and one doppler shift per star ) , for 6 consecutive months per year ( the gc is observable only part of the year ) .",
    "the starting point was the year 2000 , so the first @xmath68 years already cover the periapse passage of s2 and s14 ( fig .",
    "[ f : orbits ] ) .",
    "to each measurement we added uncorrelated random gaussian errors , with a standard deviation of @xmath69 for the radial velocities and @xmath70 per coordinate for the astrometry , which are representative of the measurement errors for s2 .",
    "the mbh s astrometric position and proper motion were assumed to be known , since frequent accretion flares can reveal the mbh s location ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these assumptions are somewhat optimistic , since s2 is better measured than most stars , and since accurate localization of the mbh by the flares is still challenging . however , judging by the continuing improvement in the data acquisition , it is not unreasonable to expect such data quality in the near future .",
    "we generated progressively longer datasets , starting from @xmath68 years and up to @xmath71 years .",
    "we repeated the entire procedure twice , both with and without the pn effects .",
    "we then applied the pn orbital fit procedure to the simulated datasets , and recorded the best - fit values of @xmath47 , as well as those of @xmath72 and @xmath39 .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ f : sim ] shows the derived values of @xmath47 for both newtonian and pn simulated orbits of the 6 stars ( of which only s2 and s14 go through deep periapse ) .",
    "the errors on @xmath47 clearly improve with longer monitoring .",
    "the two hypotheses can be decisively distinguished by the data at a @xmath73 confidence level after @xmath74 years of monitoring .",
    "the lower panel translates the errors on @xmath47 into expected detection significance for @xmath75 ( s2 only ) , @xmath67 ( s2 and s14 ) , and all @xmath66 stars .",
    "these confidence levels reflect the assumed measurement errors .",
    "the effect of a change in the assumed errors can be easily assessed by noting that a global scaling of all errors simply scales the confidence interval by the same factor .",
    "we demonstrated that leading order pn effects in the doppler shifts of stars orbiting the galactic mbh can be decisively detected in about a decade of astrometric and spectroscopic monitoring with existing instruments .",
    "we added to the usual set of keplerian orbital elements a simple pn parameter , @xmath47 , which quantifies the strength of the pn effects .",
    "this pn parameter can be easily generalized to a set of pn parameters to describe any extension of newtonian physics .",
    "it is important to optimize the observing strategy to improve the chances of detecting pn effects .",
    "generally , the observational program should focus on deep periapse passages and include as many stellar orbits as possible to better constrain the parameters and break the newtonian / pn degeneracy .",
    "our simulations were all based on the currently observed orbits and assumed optimal observing conditions .",
    "however , future observations will include additional orbits and be carried under varying observing conditions , which were not considered here .",
    "a comprehensive study of a range of orbital configurations , measurement errors and observational resources allocation strategies remains to be done .",
    "radial velocity information allows the unambiguous derivation of both the mbh mass , @xmath72 , and distance to the gc , @xmath39 , without prior assumptions ( @xcite ) .",
    "if ignored , the pn effects can introduce systematic errors in the best - fit values of these parameters .",
    "for example , the inclusion of the gravitational redshift , transverse doppler and rmer effects ( not taken into account in previous orbital solutions ) in the orbital fitting of existing data changes the best - fit values from @xmath76 to @xmath77 and from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "these changes are not yet statistically significant .",
    "however , our simulations indicate that once doppler shift measurements are available , the discrepancies can become highly significant .",
    "for example , the neglect of the pn effects in the orbital solutions of the simulated data of @xmath66 stars monitored for a decade results in @xmath80 discrepancies in the derived values of @xmath72 and @xmath39 .",
    "another closely related post - newtonian effect is phase - dependent stellar flux variability .",
    "this is due to the combined effects of relativistic beaming and the doppler shift . to leading order",
    ", beaming causes the bolometric flux to scale as @xmath81 ( @xcite , eq . 4.97b ) .",
    "however , since the infrared bands lie in the rayleigh - jeans part of typical s - star spectra , the flux in the emitted spectral range that is observed after being doppler - shifted scales as @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the total variability scales as @xmath83 , which translates to an expected variability near periapse of order @xmath84 .",
    "we note that the effects of any dark distributed mass around the mbh on the doppler shift is likely to be small , but perhaps not completely negligible .",
    "the change in the doppler shift at periapse , @xmath85 , due to the retrograde periapse shift , @xmath86 , that is induced by the gravitational potential perturbation of the dark mass ( see @xcite ) is of the order @xmath87 .",
    "this perturbation can be neglected as long as @xmath88 . the periapse shift due to",
    "the hypothesized particle dark matter cusp is completely negligible ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the periapse shift in the orbit of s2 due to the observed luminous stellar mass ( @xcite ) is only @xmath89 .",
    "the possible shift due to an extreme case of mass segregation of stellar black holes ( @xcite ) may be as high as @xmath90 .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that recent advances in infrared stellar spectroscopy allow the decisive detection of @xmath0 post - newtonian effects in the doppler shift curves with existing instruments after about a decade of observations .",
