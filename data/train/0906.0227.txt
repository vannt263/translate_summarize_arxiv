    "it is one of the biggest questions why the temperature of molecular gas in the cmz is much higher than that of dust .",
    "many molecular line observations have revealed that the temperature of molecular gas is higher than that of dust in the galactic center region ( nagayama et al .",
    "2007 , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is inconsistent with the standard molecular gas heating model because there interstellar gas is mainly heated up by hot dust .",
    "surveys in nh@xmath0 @xmath1 = ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines have revealed that this inconsistency is not confined to small regions ; in fact , it extends over the entire molecular cloud complex in the galactic center , called the cmz .",
    "this implies that a gas heating process over a hundred parsec scale differs from that in the galactic disk .    to address this problem ,",
    "the abundance ratio of ortho - nh@xmath0 to para - nh@xmath0 , ortho - to - para ratio , is a key .",
    "an nh@xmath0 molecule has two different structures .",
    "one is called ortho - nh@xmath0 , and the other para - nh@xmath0 which are different in relative orientation of the three hydrogen spins with respect to the nitrogen spin .",
    "ortho - nh@xmath0 emits @xmath3 @xmath4 lines while para - nh@xmath0 emits @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) lines .",
    "ortho - nh@xmath0 and para - nh@xmath0 are kept for a long time ( @xmath7 yr ) because no collisional or fast radiative process can transform between these two configurations of nh@xmath0 .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio is expected to be the statistical equilibrium value of 1.0 when nh@xmath0 molecules are formed in the processes of gas phase reactions under high temperature .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio is expected to be larger than unity when nh@xmath0 molecules adsorbed on cold dust grain surfaces are released into the gas phase with excess desorption energy , which is comparable to the energy difference between the ortho and para states ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the ortho - to - para ratio indicates the physical conditions in which nh@xmath0 molecules are formed .",
    "moreover , nh@xmath0 molecules formed on a dust grain surface colder than 100 k can not be released to interstellar gas without the heating of dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "nh@xmath0 molecules with a low formation temperature indicate that dust should be heated up by some process such as the passage of a shock wave ( @xcite ) .    in the cmz ,",
    "the ( 3,3 ) emission is stronger than the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emissions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that ortho - nh@xmath0 is overabundant as compared to para - nh@xmath0 .",
    "however , the ortho - to - para ratio of nh@xmath0 over the entire cmz has not yet been obtained .",
    "we aim to clarify the formation mechanism of molecular gas in the cmz by simultaneous observations in nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines and by estimating the ortho - to - para ratio .",
    "we present large - scale maps of the cmz in the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines . in section 2",
    ", we describe our observations in detail .",
    "the observed data are presented in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss the physical conditions of the cmz through measurements of the rotational temperature and the ortho - to - para ratio in nh@xmath0 lines . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the distance to the galactic center is 8.5 kpc and we use the direction on the sky based on the galactic coordinates .",
    "we conducted a large - scale survey using the kagoshima 6 m telescope of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) from september 2005 to march 2007 .",
    "we made simultaneous observations in the nh@xmath0 @xmath1 = ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines at rest frequencies of 23.694495 , 23.722633 , and 23.870129 ghz , respectively . at 23 ghz ,",
    "the telescope beamwidth was and the main beam efficiency ( @xmath8 ) was 0.54 .",
    "we used a @xmath9-band hemt amplifier whose system noise temperature was 200300 k. all spectra were obtained using a 8192-channel fx - type software - based spectrometer developed by the kagoshima university and the national institute of information and communications technology ( nict ) .",
    "the bandwidth and frequency resolution of the spectrometer are 256 mhz and 31.25 khz , respectively . at the nh@xmath0 frequencies , these correspond to a velocity coverage and velocity resolution of 3200 km s@xmath10 and 0.39 km s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we obtained 471 nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) spectra at @xmath11 and @xmath12 with a spacing of .",
    "the surveyed area corresponds to @xmath13 pc .",
    "the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) data presented in this paper were newly observed , although we have already observed them , as shown in @xcite . to obtain intensity ratios from ( 2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) to ( 1,1 ) accurately , we simultaneously observed three lines .",
    "the data shown in @xcite are not included the analysis in this paper .",
    "all data were obtained by position switching between the target positions and reference positions .",
    "the reference positions are at the galactic latitude @xmath14 , where no nh@xmath0 emission was detected .",
    "we integrated at least 30 min at each point .",
    "the relative pointing error was better than , which was verified by the observations of several h@xmath15o ( frequency ; 22.235080 ghz ) maser sources .",
    "data reduction was performed using the ultrastar package developed by the radio astronomy group at the university of tokyo ( @xcite ) . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the obtained spectra are smoothed to a velocity resolution of 5 or 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the rms noise level after smoothing to 5 km s@xmath10 is typically 0.030 k in unit of the main beam brightness temperature defined by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the antenna temperature calibrated by the chopper wheel method ( @xcite ) .",
    "this sensitivity is better than that in the data shown in @xcite by a factor of 2.7 . in this paper ,",
    "the intensities are presented in the main beam temperature .      in order to conduct an investigation of the `` wing feature '' , which is a high - velocity wing at @xmath18 at higher resolution ( see section 4.5.5 ) , we observed the area at @xmath19 and @xmath20 with a spacing of .",
    "this observation was made using the beam of the kashima 34 m telescope of nict from may to november in 2007 .",
    "the spectra in the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines were obtained by the same method as that used in the kagoshima 6 m telescope survey .",
    "we integrated at least 5 min at each point .",
    "the rms noise level after 5 km s@xmath10 smoothing is typically 0.064 k in @xmath21 .",
    "direct information about the observed lines can be seen in each line profile .",
    "significant nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) emissions for which the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds 3 were detected for 101 , 84 , and 97 positions out of 157 observed positions , respectively .",
    "the observed profiles in the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines toward four prominent positions [ sgr c @xmath22 , sgr a @xmath23 , sgr b @xmath24 , and region @xmath25 are shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the ( 2,2 ) line is the weakest , and the ( 3,3 ) line is the strongest at most positions , especially near the velocity of peak intensity .",
    "the line shapes of the three transitions are similar .",
    "although an nh@xmath0 line profile has five quadruple hyperfine lines , we can not separate these components due to the large internal motion of the gas in an observed beam .",
    "the line shapes reflect the violent motion of the gas .      to figure out the nh@xmath0 gas distribution on the sky over the entire cmz , the velocity integrated intensity distribution is useful for comparison with the maps observed in radio and infrared continuum emissions .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the @xmath26-@xmath27 maps of intensities , velocity - integrated in the range of @xmath28 to 200 km s@xmath10 , covering the nh@xmath0 emission .",
    "the observed area is extended to @xmath29 from the previous survey ( @xcite ) along the galactic plane .",
    "the distributions in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are consistent with those shown in @xcite ; in addition , fainter peaks and diffuse emission were detected because of the improved sensitivity .",
    "the total integrated intensities in the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines of the entire observed area are 1693 , 1159 , and 2120 k km s@xmath10 , respectively",
    ".    the ( 3,3 ) line is emitted by the ortho - nh@xmath0 .",
    "the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are emitted by the para - nh@xmath0 .",
    "ortho and para - nh@xmath0 can not be transformed by collisional or fast radiative process in the interstellar gas .",
    "this implies that the ortho- and para - nh@xmath0 molecules can be dealt with as different molecular species .",
    "therefore , the similarity of the intensity distribution in the ( 3,3 ) line with those in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines should contain some astrophysical information .",
    "the @xmath26-@xmath27 maps in the nh@xmath0 lines appear similar to other molecular lines such as those of co ( @xcite ) and cs ( @xcite ) .",
    "this similarity is not only in the sky distribution but in the @xmath26-@xmath30 domain .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows @xmath26-@xmath30 diagrams of three transitions integrated over the observed latitudes and figure [ fig:4 ] shows the @xmath26-@xmath30 diagrams at a fixed latitude . even for @xmath31 km s@xmath10 ,",
    "the nh@xmath0 lines are not affected by foreground absorption ; in contrast , the effect is significant in the co line . due to the difference of the critical densities",
    ", the co line traces lower - density gas whereas the nh@xmath0 line traces only higher - density gas , @xmath32(h@xmath15 ) @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the nh@xmath0 and co lines trace the different density gas microscopically .",
    "therefore , morphological similarity suggests that the flux ratio of core to envelope in an observed beam is almost uniform over the cmz .",
    "moreover , the fairly large optical depths in both lines ( @xmath35 24 ) may reduce the morphological difference , because both lines mainly trace the outer envelope of the cloud complex .      to investigate the gas properties at various locations in the cmz",
    ", we divide the intensity distribution into several small regions and define a _ cloud _ as a single peak in the @xmath26-@xmath30 and @xmath27-@xmath30 distributions , with the intensities stronger than the 3 @xmath36 level ( @xmath37 k in @xmath21 ) in all three lines .",
    "based on this definition , we identified 13 clouds .",
    "the total integrated intensity of these 13 clouds is 3447 k km s@xmath10 , which corresponds to 69% of the integrated intensity of the entire observed area .",
    "therefore , the majority of the nh@xmath0 gas in the cmz is traced by these clouds .",
    "the peak positions , apparent sizes , and line widths of these clouds are listed in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we defined their sizes and widths ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ) as apparent full widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the main - beam temperature without beamsize deconvolution .",
    "the integrated intensities of the clouds are shown in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "four major clouds of the cmz are seen in the nh@xmath0 maps ( from west to east : the sgr a 20 km s@xmath10 cloud at @xmath41 , the sgr a 40 km s@xmath10 cloud at @xmath42 , the sgr b cloud at @xmath43 , and the region cloud at @xmath44 ) .",
    "these clouds were also detected in the previous observation ( @xcite ) , and their locations and extents are found to be the same with those of the previous ones . in our new map , we clearly detected the nh@xmath0 clouds associated with the sgr c h region at @xmath45 and a part of the expanding molecular ring ( emr ) at @xmath46 .",
    "both had been marginally detected in the previous observation .",
    "the intensity ratio of the ( 2,2 ) line to the ( 1,1 ) line , @xmath47 , is determined by the optical depth , @xmath48 , and the kinetic temperature , @xmath49 , of the gas . with a given optical depth",
    ", the rotational temperature of the transition , @xmath50 , can be derived from the @xmath47 and it gives the gas kinetic temperature .",
    "therefore , the changing line ratios indicate the differences of the rotational temperature .",
    "figure [ fig:5](a ) shows the histograms of ratio for the integrated intensity over the entire observed area with 3 @xmath36 detection in both the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines after smoothing to 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 ranges between 0.4 and 1.5 .",
    "the mean value and standard deviation of @xmath47 are derived to be 0.70 and 0.15 , respectively .",
    "the nh@xmath0 integrated intensity with @xmath510.8 and @xmath52 are 82% and 18% of the total nh@xmath0 integrated intensity , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the results described in @xcite .",
    "the intensity ratio of the ( 3,3 ) line to the ( 1,1 ) line , @xmath53 , is determined by the relative abundance of the ortho - to - para nh@xmath0 , @xmath54 , and the kinetic temperature . in the case",
    "that ortho - nh@xmath0 and para - nh@xmath0 have the same kinetic temperature , @xmath53 increases with @xmath54 . in the case that the ortho - to - para ratio is uniform , @xmath53 increases with the kinetic temperature .",
    "we can estimate the ortho - to - para ratio using the kinetic temperature obtained by the @xmath47 .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio depends on the temperature when nh@xmath0 molecules are formed .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio increases in the case that nh@xmath0 molecules are produced in low temperature conditions ( e.g. , more than 10 at 5 k ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath53 is the direct observed value that is related to the ortho - to - para ratio , and therefore , it should be studied in detail .",
    "the ( 3,3 ) emission is stronger than the ( 1,1 ) emission at most observed positions .",
    "the nh@xmath0 integrated intensity for @xmath55 is 90% of the total nh@xmath0 intensity .",
    "the histogram of @xmath53 is shown in figure [ fig:5](b ) .",

    ", we show the @xmath26-@xmath30 diagrams of @xmath47 and @xmath53 superimposed on the ( 1,1 ) emission integrated over the entire observed latitude in figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath47 and @xmath53 vary with the location .",
    "the high - ratio region is common in both the ratios .",
    "although the kinematical timescale significantly depends on the galactocentric distance , neither ratio exhibits any systematic structure dependent on the distance from the galactic center .",
    "overall , the distributions of @xmath47 and @xmath53 are similar . however , some regions such as the sgr c cloud near @xmath56 exhibit a much lower @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath49 derived from the @xmath47 is thought to be the current temperature of the gas . the temperature derived from the ortho - to - para ratio corresponds to the temperature when the nh@xmath0 molecules were formed ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two temperatures can be obtained from the nh@xmath0 observations . in the case",
    "that the entire interstellar matter is under thermal equilibrium and in a steady state , the two temperatures are the same .",
    "we derived the @xmath49 of the gas under the cases of optically thin ( @xmath57 ) and thick ( @xmath58 ) using the same method as that described in @xcite .",
    "the gas is warmer than the dust ( @xmath5922 k ; @xcite ) at most observed positions , which is consistent with the conclusion shown in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath600.8 and @xmath61 correspond to @xmath6280 k and @xmath63 k , respectively .",
    "the gases corresponding to @xmath49 values of 2080 k and @xmath64 k contain 82% and 18% of the total nh@xmath0 integrated intensity in the entire observed area , respectively . the higher ratio ( @xmath65 ) components are located at @xmath56 , , , and ( figure [ fig:6](a ) ) .",
    "these locations coincide with those of high co @xmath66 32/@xmath66 10 ratios ( @xmath67 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this supports the notion that the components with higher @xmath47 values trace the high - temperature gas .",
    "@xmath65 corresponds to @xmath68 k in the optically thin case and @xmath69 k in the optically thick case ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath70 k , which is derived from a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) calculation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high @xmath53 value in the cmz indicates that the ortho - nh@xmath0 is overabundant as compared to para - nh@xmath0 . to obtain the ortho - to - para ratio , we estimated the column densities using the rotation diagram method under the optically thin assumption .",
    "we derived the column densities of each level from the integrated intensities .",
    "the procedure is based on @xcite .",
    "although the optical depth of the nh@xmath0 lines in the cmz is moderate ( @xmath71 24 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . and the ortho - to - para ratio changes with the optical depth , the value obtained under the optically thin assumption can provide the lower limit of the ortho - to - para ratio ( @xmath72 at @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath73 at @xmath74 ) .    because of the absence of emission lines from molecules at the ( 0,0 ) level , we can not obtain the column density of the ( 0,0 ) level directly .",
    "however , we can derive the column density of the nh@xmath0 at the ( 0,0 ) level under the assumption that the ortho- and para - nh@xmath0 molecules are thermalized at the same rotational temperature derived from the @xmath47 .",
    "this assumption is a better approximation than using the rotational temperature between ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) , because the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) levels are between the ( 0,0 ) and ( 3,3 ) levels .",
    "the energies of the ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) levels are 124.5 k and 412.4 k above the ground state , respectively .",
    "the large energy difference between the ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) levels suggests that the ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) emissions originate from different components .",
    "we calculated the column densities of ortho - nh@xmath0 and para - nh@xmath0 by the formulas @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the column densities of the levels higher than ( 4,4 ) are less than 2% of those of the ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) levels when the rotational temperature is 36 k , which is estimated from the mean @xmath77 .",
    "we considered only the metastable states ( @xmath78 ) , because transitions from non - metastable states ( @xmath79 ) to metasable states are generally quite rapid .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows histograms of the ortho - to - para ratio for the integrated intensity over the entire observed area with 10 @xmath36 detection in the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines after smoothing to 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the mean value and the standard deviation of @xmath54 are derived to be 2.0 and 0.6 , respectively . to investigate the spatial distributions of the ortho - to - para ratio ,",
    "we have plotted the ortho - to - para ratio on the @xmath26-@xmath30 plane , as shown in figure [ fig:8 ] .",
    "we found that the ortho - to - para ratio varies with the location , and it does not exhibit systematic structures dependent on the distance from the galactic center nor the core / envelope of clouds .",
    "the distributions of @xmath47 and @xmath53 appear similar on the @xmath26-@xmath30 plane ( figure [ fig:6 ] ) . to see this correlation",
    "quantitatively , we made a correlation plot of @xmath47 and @xmath53 , as shown in figure [ fig:9 ] .",
    "@xmath53 depends on both @xmath54 and @xmath50 , although @xmath47 depends on only @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we can draw curves of constant @xmath54 values on the @xmath47-@xmath53 domain ( figure [ fig:9 ] ) .",

    "this suggests that the entire cmz should be under physical conditions as similar to an intense starforming core .",
    "it has been reported that the ortho - to - para ratios of nearby external galaxies are as high as that of the cmz",
    ". the ortho - to - para ratios of maffei 2 , arp 220 , and ngc 253 are 2.6 , 1.7 , and 6.2 , respectively ( @xcite ; 2002 ; 2005 ) .",

    "ic 342 exhibits lower @xmath54 as compared to that of other galaxies .",
    "however , @xmath54 of ic 342 is calculated to be @xmath83 from the data obtained using the nro 45 m telescope ( s. takano , 2008 private communication ) .",
    "therefore , ic 342 may actually have a high @xmath54 value .",
    "m82 also shows low @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite suggests that the evolutionary stage of the starburst in m 82 is different from those of ngc 253 and ic 342 .",
    "this difference may relate to the low ortho - to - para ratio in m 82 .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio is @xmath84 for the cmz and most of external galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the ortho - to - para ratio of the cmz and the central region of the galaxies is higher than that of galactic disk .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio is related to the temperature when nh@xmath0 molecules are formed .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio approaches unity when nh@xmath0 molecules are produced under high temperature ( @xmath69 k ) conditions .",
    "this ratio increases when nh@xmath0 molecules are produced and equilibrated at low temperature ( e.g. , more than 10 at 5 k ) .",
    "this is because most of molecules then reside in the lowest state , or the ( 0,0 ) ortho level .",
    "the relationship between the ortho - to - para ratio and the formation temperature is shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "our observation shows the ortho - to - para ratio is 1.53.5 for 95% of the total integrated intensity of the entire cmz ( figure [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "this ratio corresponds to a formation temperature of 1120 k. this is much lower than the gas kinetic temperature derived from @xmath47 .",
    "the low formation temperature of nh@xmath0 suggests that most of the nh@xmath0 in the cmz was not produced by a gas - phase reaction .",
    "if nh@xmath0 were produced with a formation temperature of @xmath85 k , that is , the current gas temperature , the ortho - to - para ratio should be @xmath86 .",
    "only 5% of the total integrated intensity shows @xmath87 .",
    "it should be noted that the formation temperature of nh@xmath0 is similar to the dust temperature in the cmz , which is estimated to be @xmath88 1522 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the observed nh@xmath0 molecules were formed on the surface of cold dust grains .    at the observed formation temperature , i.e. , 1120 k",
    ", nh@xmath0 molecules can not be released from the dust surface into a gas phase .",
    "therefore , the dust should be heated up to 100 k to release the nh@xmath0 from the dust to the gas phase , because the ice at 100 k can release nh@xmath0 within a few years ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transition timescale of ortho - nh@xmath0 and para - nh@xmath0 is @xmath7 yr in the interstellar gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the observed ortho - to - para ratio is larger than the statistical equilibrium value , nh@xmath0 would be released from the dust within the transition timescale .",
    "therefore , the dust must be heated within @xmath89 yr .      in the previous section",
    ", we suggested that the bulk of nh@xmath0 gas in the cmz must be released from the dust that was previously heated up .",
    "we attribute this heating process to the followings possibilities : interstellar shocks , direct dust collisions , a starburst , and ambipolar diffution . considering these mechanisms",
    ", we suggest that the interstellar shocks caused by a supernova and the direct dust collisions would be possible mechanisms for our transient dust heating scenario .",
    "we first consider the passage of an interstellar shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "for galactic disk objects , the enhancement of the ortho - to - para ratio due to an interstellar shock is supported by the nh@xmath0 observations of the active and massive star - forming regions ( figure [ fig:9 ] ) . in such a source ,",
    "a strong bipolar outflow is produced , and it creates a strong shock , although the shocked region is much more compact than the cmz .",
    "the interstellar shock can heat the interstellar gas directly . although the gas can hardly heat the interstellar dust , accelerated electrons",
    "can heat the dust grain .    in the cmz , there is considerable evidence suggesting the presence of an extended shocked region .",
    "the ubiquity of the intense thermal sio lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and many shell structures on the @xmath26-@xmath30 map observed in the cs line ( @xcite ) are attributed to be caused by the strong shocks passing through the entire cmz .",
    "these shocks can transiently heat the dust .    what is the origin of the shock ?",
    "multiple supernovae ( sn ) shocks are the first possibility .",
    "we estimated the timescale at which sn shocks blow through the cmz to be @xmath33 yr using the multi - phase interstellar gas model of @xcite . in this estimation",
    ", we used an sn rate of @xmath90@xmath91 pc@xmath92 yr@xmath10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the h atom density at the sn remnant interior of @xmath93 @xmath34 ( @xcite ) . in the galactic center region ,",
    "the h atom density of the ambient interstellar medium is larger than that in the galactic disk region , the h atom density at the sn remnant interior may also be larger .",
    "however , even if @xmath94 @xmath34 , the timescale is @xmath95 yr .",
    "galactic bar shock is the second possibility .",
    "the molecular gas in the cmz should be strongly affected by a non - axisymmetric potential .",
    "the gas forms a bar - like structure , and is undergoing a strong non - circular motion ( @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case , a strong shock is expected at the leading edge of the bar ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this shock is observed in extra galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we estimated the timescale at which the galactic bar shock passes through the entire cmz to be @xmath96 yr which is half of the rotation period at a radius of 250 pc and a velocity of 200 km s@xmath10 .",
    "however , the absence of systematic structure in the ortho - to - para ratio suggests that the galactic bar does not produce the fresh nh@xmath0 .",
    "cloud - cloud collisions are also a possible trigger of the shock wave .",
    "the energy of turbulent motions in the clouds within 300 pc of the center is @xmath97 erg ( @xcite ) .",
    "this energy is larger than the thermal energy required to heat the dust to 100 k , @xmath98 erg , which is estimated from the total dust mass in the central 400 pc of @xmath99 ( @xcite ) , and the specific heat of graphite of @xmath100 erg k@xmath10 g@xmath10 .",
    "cloud - cloud collisions may heat the dust surface by the transfer of energy through the shock wave .",
    "however , the timescale of cloud - cloud collisions is one order of magnitude longer than the transition timescale of nh@xmath0 , @xmath7 yr , as shown below .",
    "the collision timescale is estimated by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the number density of clouds , @xmath103 is the collisional cross section , and @xmath104 is the relative velocity . the number density of clouds is estimated from the total molecular mass in the entire cmz of ( 38 ) @xmath105 ( e.g. @xcite ) and a cloud mass of @xmath106 .",
    "we use a cloud radius of 1 pc and a h@xmath15 number density of @xmath107 @xmath34 in this estimation because clouds with a size of several pc are observed in the cs maps of @xcite , and the critical density of cs is @xmath108 @xmath34 .",
    "the collisional cross section is @xmath109 @xmath110 at a cloud radius of 1 pc .",
    "the relative velocity of clouds is assumed to be @xmath111 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the timescale of cloud - cloud collisions is estimated to be @xmath112 yr from these values .",
    "the comparison of the timescales suggests that cloud - cloud collisions can not heat the dust frequently enough .",
    "the direct collision of dust particles is the second mechanism .",
    "the dust surface is heated to @xmath113 k when all of the collisional energy is transferred to the heating energy of dust . in this mechanism",
    ", the dust particles must collide within the conversion timescale of ortho - nh@xmath0 and para - nh@xmath0 .",
    "the collision timescale is estimated by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the number density of dust particles , @xmath116 is the collisional cross section , and @xmath117 is the turbulent velocity . the total dust mass within the central 400 pc is @xmath99 ( @xcite ) , and the mass of a dust particle is estimated to be @xmath118 g for a dust particle radius of 1 @xmath119 m and mass density of charcoal powder of 1.5 g @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the number density is estimated to be @xmath120 @xmath34 .",
    "this is an average value over the entire cmz .",
    "the collisional cross section is @xmath121 @xmath110 at a radius of 1 @xmath119 m .",
    "the turbulent velocity is assumed to be @xmath122 km s@xmath10 . using these values",
    ", we estimated @xmath123 yr .",
    "this timescale is upper limit .",
    "if the dust is concentrated in the core of each cloud with the same turbulent motion , @xmath115 is larger and it gives shorter @xmath124 . before the grains collide directly , the gas clouds that contain dust particles collide with each other . in this case",
    ", the dust particles can slow down before the direct collision .",
    "however they are also affected by gas drag , which heats up the dust .",
    "therefore , the conclusion remains valid , unless the dust particles are tightly bounded in the molecular clouds by the gas drag . in this case",
    ", the discussion should be the same as that of cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "the comparison of timescales suggests that the direct collision of dust particles is a possible heating mechanism .",
    "another heating mechanism is a transient starburst .",
    "when a dust particle is heated up to 100 k by strong uv radiation , nh@xmath0 molecules are released in the interstellar space .",
    "there is substantial evidence that indicates a burst of star formation in the galactic center .",
    "however , this occurred @xmath125@xmath126 years ago ( @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "this timescale is much longer than the transition timescale of nh@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a transient starburst could not have heated the dust .",
    "the last mechanism is an ambipolar diffusion .",
    "@xcite suggested that the gas can be heated up to @xmath127 200 k by collisions between neutrals and ions under a magnetic field strength of 500 @xmath119 g .",
    "however , this mechanism does not work well in our transient heating scenario .",
    "the energy of collision between the dust particle and an ion is fifteen order of magnitude smaller than that of direct dust collision .",
    "the collisional energy is too small to heat the dust to a sufficient temperature to release the nh@xmath0 , 100 k. therefore , the dust could not been heated by ambipolar diffusion ,    our model requires the heating to have occurred within @xmath89 yr .",
    "therefore , sn shocks , galactic shocks , and direct dust collisions are possible .",
    "however , our estimation of the cooling timescale of molecular gas , which is described in the next subsection , indicates that the timescale should be @xmath95 yr .",
    "therefore , a galactic shock that occurred @xmath7 yr ago is not preferable .",
    "we therefore conclude that sn shocks and direct dust collisions would be possible mechanisms for our transient dust heating scenario , and both mechanisms can produce fresh nh@xmath0 from the dust grains .",
    "we expect that there should be the difference of the spatial distributions in the sn shocks and the direct dust collisions .",
    "in the case of the sn shocks , the dust would be heated in the shocked layer . in the case of the direct dust collisions ,",
    "individual heating spot is the fairly smaller scale of dust particles .",
    "these minor heated dusts are mixed with the major cool dusts in the observed beam , therefore they are uniformly observed as cold dusts .",
    "submillimeter wave observations with very high resolution could find the differences of the distributions between two mechanisms .",
    "nh@xmath0 is released from the dust grains to the gas - phase at a sublimation temperature of @xmath128 k. therefore , the dust should be heated up to to @xmath128 k in the case that nh@xmath0 molecules are released from the dust .",
    "the observed gas temperature is close to this temperature .",
    "however , the observed dust temperature is much lower .    to resolve this discrepancy",
    ", we hypothesize that the interstellar matter in the galactic center region is not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the dust is believed to heat the gas through the photoelectric process , however , the gas can not heat the dust .",
    "therefore , our hypothesis would be confirmed if the cooling timescale of gas is much longer than that of dust .",
    "we estimated the timescale in which the gas is cooled from 100 to 10 k. the main cooling process of the gas in this temperature range is co emission .",
    "the cooling timescale of gas is estimated to be @xmath129 yr from the thermal energy of @xmath130 erg and the co cooling rate of @xmath131 erg s@xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimated the timescale in which the dust is cooled from 100 to 10 k. the major cooling process of the dust in this temperature range is black body radiation .",
    "the thermal energy of the dust with temperature @xmath132 at time @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 denote the radius , density , and specific heat of dust .",
    "the cooling rate of the dust by the black body radiation is given by @xmath138 ^ 4 \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "using these equations , we found the cooling timescale of dust from 100 to 10 k to be @xmath139 yr for @xmath140 m , @xmath141 g @xmath34 as the mass density of charcoal powder , and @xmath142 erg k@xmath10 g@xmath10 as the specific heat of the graphite .",
    "the cooling timescale of the gas is 7 orders of magnitude longer than that of the dust .",
    "therefore , transient heating of the interstellar matter occurred in the past , and the observed temperature difference between the gas and the dust can be observed soon after the heating .",
    "this may explain why temperature of molecular gas is much higher than that of the dust .",
    "we estimated the physical parameters of the identified 13 clouds under the optically thin assumption .",
    "the calculated rotational temperatures , column densities , and ortho - to - para ratios are listed in table [ tab:3 ] .    with regard to the clouds in the cmz",
    ", the virial masses observed in the co line are one order of magnitude larger than the mass derived from the co luminosity with a standard conversion factor ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the clouds in the cmz may not be gravitationally bound and are instead in pressure equilibrium with the hot gas or magnetic field in this region .",
    "however , the cloud observed in the nh@xmath0 line may not be affected by the external pressure because the nh@xmath0 line would trace a different density range .",
    "therefore , we investigate the virial mass and luminosity mass in the nh@xmath0 line . using the abundance ratio of @xmath143(nh@xmath0 ) = @xmath91 ( @xcite ) and spherically symmetric geometry ,",
    "the h@xmath15 number densities are derived from the luminosity masses to be @xmath32(h@xmath15 ) @xmath144@xmath107 @xmath34 , as given in table [ tab:3 ] .",
    "these values are consistent with the nh@xmath0 critical density , suggesting that the estimated luminosity masses are valid .",
    "we estimated the luminosity mass , @xmath145 , from the integration of the column densities , and the virial mass , @xmath146 , from the apparent size with the beam deconvolution and the observed line width .",
    "we summarize these values of the 13 clouds in table [ tab:3 ] and show the @xmath145-@xmath146 plot in figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "the luminosity mass and virial mass of nine clouds are consistent with an order of magnitude .",
    "this implies that most of the molecular clouds traced by the nh@xmath0 line are roughly in virial equilibrium .",
    "the external pressure affects only the less dense gas traced by the co line .",
    "only four clouds ( i d 1 , 3 , 6 , and 8) appear to not be in the virial equilibrium , although there are reasons in each case , as given below . in the @xmath26-@xmath30 diagram , these clouds do not lie on the main ridge that indicates the main rotating component of the milky way galaxy .",
    "the rotational temperature and the ortho - to - para ratio of these clouds are different from those of the other clouds .",
    "we summarize the features of these four unvirialized clouds as follows .",
    "cloud 1 is located at the western edge of the observed area and at @xmath147 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the velocity and angular extent suggest that cloud 1 may be located in the galactic disk .",
    "the annihilation source 1e1740.7 - 2942 is located close to the cloud in the sky . @xcite",
    "assumed that the source is not associated to the 0 km s@xmath10 component because it should not be in the galactic center region .",
    "however , the rotational temperature of @xmath148 k is higher than that of the disk clouds and close to that of the clouds in the galactic center . therefore , we conclude that cloud 1 may be located at the galactic center region . in a higher - resolution map in the cs line ( @xcite ) ,",
    "two clouds are observed at the position of cloud 1 . in the case that these clouds are gravitationally unbound , our estimation of the virial mass is overestimated and the large discrepancy between the two masses is not real .",
    "cloud 3 is located at sgr c in the sky .",
    "the peak velocity in the nh@xmath0 line of @xmath149 km s@xmath10 is close to the central velocity in the h91@xmath150 and h109@xmath150 recombination lines of @xmath151 km s@xmath10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the sgr c h region is physically associated .",
    "it interacts with the molecular cloud and ionizes a part of it .",
    "the rotational temperature of @xmath152 k is higher than that of other clouds in the cmz .",
    "this suggests that cloud 3 is heated by the h region and it is expanding rapidly due to the active star formation .",
    "cloud 6 is located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath153 ) at @xmath154 km s@xmath10 .",
    "it is redshifted approximately 60 km s@xmath10 from the sgr a 50 km s@xmath10 cloud , which is located at the same longitude .",
    "this cloud appears as a shell - like structure on the @xmath26-@xmath30 map in the cs line ( @xcite ) .",
    "soft x - ray ( 13 kev ) emission is detected at the position of this cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "these suggest that this cloud is associated with a newly identified supernova remnant",
    ". the large virial mass should be due to expansion of this sn remnant .",
    "the kinetic energy is @xmath98 erg when cloud 6 is expanding with a mass of @xmath155 and an expansion velocity of @xmath156 = 17 km s@xmath10 .",
    "this energy is comparable to the kinetic energy of the stellar wind from a 60100 star ( @xcite ) and less than that of a hypernova explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "cloud 8 is the same structure reported in @xcite .",
    "the rotational temperature and the number density of this cloud are higher than those of other clouds .",
    "the location of this cloud is close to that of the anomaly reported from the observation in co line ( @xcite ) .",
    "the features of high temperature and density are similar to the anomaly .",
    "although the highly blue - shifted component ( @xmath157 km s@xmath10 ) is detected in co line , we could not detect this component .",
    "this cloud is unresolved by the kagoshima 6 m telescope beam .",
    "however , it could be resolved by a high resolution observation using the kashima 34 m telescope .",
    "figures [ fig:11 ] and [ fig:12 ] show the @xmath26-@xmath30 and @xmath27-@xmath30 maps obtained using the kashima 34 m telescope . in this higher - resolution observation ,",
    "the cloud is resolved into three components .",
    "the peak positions , apparent sizes , and line widths of these components are shown in table [ tab:4 ] .",
    "we call these three components 8a , 8b , and 8c in the order of the galactic longitude",
    ". cloud 8 has a large virial mass because it is an unbound system .",
    "the rotational temperatures of all components are similar , and they are higher than the mean temperature of the cmz . the location and velocity of components 8c is close to the high velocity compact cloud , co 0.88@xmath1580.08 ( @xcite )",
    ". these would be the same structure .",
    "however , the component 8a and 8b are not detected in co line ( @xcite ) .",
    "this would be because the co line is affected by foreground absorption .",
    "we summarize the physical parameters of three components that have been obtained under the optically thin assumption in table [ tab:5 ] .",
    "their virial masses are the same as their luminosity masses within a factor of @xmath159 .",

    "our observations are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we obtained the ortho - to - para ratio of nh@xmath0 in the cmz to be 1.53.5 using the rotation diagram method .",
    "this ratio is higher than that of galactic disk clouds , and as same as those of the active and massive star forming regions and the centers of nearby external galaxies . 2 .",
    "an ortho - to - para ratio of 1.53.5 corresponds to a formation temperature of 1120 k. the formation temperature is very close to the temperature of dust .",
    "nh@xmath0 in the cmz has been produced on the cold dust grains and released into the gas phase by sn shocks or direct dust collisions .",
    "3 .   the discrepancy between warm molecular gas and cold dust can be explained by transient heating of the interstellar media in the cmz on a timescale @xmath2 years .",

    "<S> it is an open question why the temperature of molecular gas in the galactic center region is higher than that of dust . to address this problem , we made simultaneous observations in the nh@xmath0 @xmath1 = ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines of the central molecular zone ( cmz ) using the kagoshima 6 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the ortho - to - para ratio of nh@xmath0 molecules in the cmz is 1.53.5 at most observed area . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is higher than the statistical equilibrium value , and suggests that the formation temperature of nh@xmath0 is 1120 k. this temperature is similar to the dust temperature estimated from the submillimeter and infrared continuum . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the nh@xmath0 molecules in the cmz were produced on dust grains with the currently observed temperature ( 1120 k ) , and they were released into the gas phase by supernova shocks or collisions of dust particles . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between warm molecular gas and cold dust can be explained by the transient heating of the interstellar media in the cmz approximately @xmath2 years ago when the nh@xmath0 molecules were released from the dust . </S>"
