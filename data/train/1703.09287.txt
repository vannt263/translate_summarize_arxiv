    "jets are ideal probes of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) because they originate from hard - scattered partons created early in the collision , prior to the formation of the medium .",
    "these partons are modified in the presence of a medium through collisional energy loss and induced gluon radiation .",
    "this modification is observed at both lhc and rhic energies via the suppression of high - momentum particles @xcite .",
    "a suppression is also seen for high @xmath1 di - hadron correlations @xcite .    by reconstructing jets , ideally , a more complete picture of how lost energy is redistributed and how the effects of jet quenching emerge can be obtained .",
    "this article will discuss the status of azimuthal correlations of reconstructed jets binned relative to the event plane with charged hadrons in alice .",
    "clusters measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) and charged hadrons measured with the central tracking system allow alice to study fully reconstructed jets @xcite .",
    "charged hadrons are reconstructed from their tracks using information from the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the inner tracking system ( its ) .",
    "tracks are reconstructed over the full azimuthal range and come from mid - rapidity in a range of @xmath20.7 when reconstructed in a jet , and @xmath20.9 for the associated charged hadrons .",
    "the emcal has an acceptance window of @xmath20.7 and @xmath3=107@xmath4 . for a complete description of the alice detector ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the data used for the correlation analysis was collected by the alice experiment in 2011 during the 2.76 tev pb  pb collision data taking .",
    "this work uses events which fired the gamma trigger used by the alice emcal @xcite .",
    "in addition , a cluster constituent of the trigger jet was required to be matched to the fired trigger patch of the event .",
    "jets are reconstructed with a resolution parameter of r=0.2 using the anti-@xmath5 jet - finding algorithm from the fastjet package @xcite .",
    "jets reconstructed in this analysis require a leading cluster to have @xmath66.0 gev , which exceeds the trigger threshold .",
    "the jets are reconstructed with constituent tracks of @xmath73.0 gev/@xmath8and clusters of @xmath63.0 gev .",
    "since the primary goal of jet finding is to reconstruct the jet axis accurately , this high constituent cut limits the influence of background on jet finding .",
    "we define the jet - hadron correlation function in heavy - ion collisions by eq .",
    "[ correlation_eqn_pbpb ] .",
    "@xmath9    here the first term represents the same event pairs which are divided by an acceptance correction , a , provided by mixed events .",
    "mixed events are used to correct for the limited detector efficiency and acceptance for track pairs .",
    "the single track reconstruction efficiency of associated particles is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "[ correlation_eqn_pbpb ] is the combinatorial heavy - ion background where @xmath11 is the background level and the @xmath12 terms are the fourier coefficients of the trigger jet and associated particles .",
    "the trigger jets in this analysis are binned in angle relative to the event plane to explore the path length dependence of medium modifications .",
    "the orientations are defined such that in - plane is @xmath13 , mid - plane is @xmath14 , and out - of - plane is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the angular difference between the trigger jet and the reconstructed event plane .      when the trigger jet is restricted relative to the event plane , both the background level and @xmath17 are modified and will contain a dependence on the reaction plane resolution @xmath18 .",
    "the derivation of the event plane dependent background equations are given in @xcite .",
    "the reaction plane resolution corrects for the difference between the reconstructed event plane and the underlying symmetry plane , @xmath19 .",
    "various background subtraction methods were developed in @xcite and applied to the azimuthal correlation functions .",
    "the primary method is the reaction plane fit ( rpf ) .",
    "the rpf method works under the assumption that the signal is negligible in the large @xmath20 and small @xmath21 region .",
    "the 2d correlations are projected over 0.8@xmath221.2 to define the background dominated region , while the signal+background region is defined to be @xmath230.6 . to ensure",
    "as much information as possible is going into the fit by constraining the shape and level of the background , the in - plane , mid - plane , and out - of - plane orientations are simultaneously fit up to fourth order in @xmath17 and required to have the same fit parameters .",
    "the background dominated region is fit over the region @xmath24 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpffitdata1.5 - 2.0 ] .",
    "we see from the blue band that the rpf fit models the data quite well , even at low @xmath1 where the background is large .",
    "the higher order fourier coefficents clearly matter , as the background for trigger jets mid - plane has four peaks , consistent with a @xmath25 dependence .",
    "this method does not require independent measurements of @xmath17 and is able to extract the signal with smaller errors while requiring fewer assumptions and less bias than prior subtraction methods .",
