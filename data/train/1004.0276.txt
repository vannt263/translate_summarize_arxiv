    "the optical variability of quasars has been recognized since they were first identified ( matthews & sandage 1963 ) . indeed , most quasars are variable ( @xmath090% at the 0.03 mag rms level ; sesar et al .  2007 ) , and the variations in brightness are aperiodic and on the order of 20% on time scales of months to years ( e.g. , hook et al .  1994 ; vanden berk et al .",
    "furthermore , the smooth power spectra suggest a chaotic , or stochastic , origin for the variability . a range of models have been advanced to describe quasar variability , including supernova bursts , microlensing , and accretion disk instabilities ( aretxaga et al .",
    "1997 ; hawkins  1993 ; kawaguchi et al .  1998 ; trvese & vagnetti  2002 ) .",
    "these models are discussed and compared in hawkins  ( 2007 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping studies ( e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "2005 ) show that the broad emission lines respond to continuum fluctuations , therefore providing strong evidence that the variability is intrinsic to the quasars .",
    "a number of studies have utilized standard accretion disk models to demonstrate that the optical - uv variability of quasars could be driven by a variable accretion rate ( e.g. , pereyra et al .",
    "2006 ; li & cao 2008 ; liu et al .",
    "blackburne & kochanek ( 2010 ) find evidence in the light curves of microlensed quasars that the optical variability is caused by a change in the effective area of the accretion disk .",
    "recently , kelly et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter kbs09 ) proposed a model where the optical variability is described by a damped random walk ( a self - correcting term added to a random walk model that acts to push any deviations back towards the mean value ) .",
    "they proposed that the variability time scale might be identified with the thermal time scale of accretion disks , as also proposed by collier & peterson  ( 2001 ) .",
    "a thermal origin of the variability would explain why quasars become bluer as they brighten ( e.g. , giveon et al .  1999 ; trvese et al .",
    "2001 ; geha et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "although the physical causes have yet to be proven , it has been established by kbs09 and kozowski et al .",
    "( 2010a , hereafter koz10 ) that a damped random walk can statistically explain the observed light curves of quasars . using 100 well - sampled single - band light curves compiled from the literature , kbs09 show that this stochastic process is capable of modeling complex quasar light curves at an impressive fidelity level ( 0.01 - 0.02 mag ) .",
    "koz10 applied the model to the ogle light curves ( udalski et al .",
    "1997 ; udalski et al .",
    "2008 ) of mid - infrared - selected quasars behind the magellanic clouds from kozowski & kochanek ( 2009 ) .",
    "their analysis shows that this stochastic model is robust enough to efficiently select quasars from other variable sources ( see schmidt et al .",
    "2010 for a different method of selecting quasars based on variability ) .",
    "the model has only three free parameters : the mean value of the light curve , the driving amplitude of the stochastic process , and the damping time scale .",
    "the predictions are only statistical , and the random nature reflects our uncertainty about the details of the physical processes .    instead of applying a model to observed light curves for individual quasars , numerous studies have looked at the ensemble variability of quasars , particularly in samples where individual light curves are not available .",
    "significant progress in the description of quasar variability has been made by employing the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter vb04 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter i04 ; de vries et al .  2005 ; wilhite et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2008 ; sesar et al .",
    "for example , the size and quality of the sample analyzed by vb04 ( two - epoch photometry for 25,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ) allowed them to constrain how quasar variability in the rest frame optical / uv regime depends upon rest - frame time lag ( up to @xmath02 years ) , luminosity , rest wavelength , redshift , the presence of radio and x - ray emission , and the presence of broad absorption line systems . using repeated sdss photometric observations , wilhite et al .",
    "( 2008 ) confirmed the result of wold et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that variability is correlated with black hole mass , and show that this is independent of the anti - correlation between variability and luminosity established by many studies .",
    "this led them to suggest that the amplitude of variability may be driven by the quasar s eddington ratio , implying differences in accretion rate .",
    "these studies typically quantify the observed optical variability of quasars using a structure function ( sf ) analysis ( see also hughes et al .  1992 ; collier & peterson 2001 ; bauer et al .",
    "2009 ; kozowski et al .",
    "2010b ) , where the sf is the root - mean - square ( rms ) magnitude difference as a function of the time lag ( @xmath5 ) between measurements .",
    "this autocorrelation - like function is less sensitive to aliasing and other time - sampling problems than a power spectral distribution . by studying the magnitude difference distribution for appropriately chosen subsamples with fixed values of absolute i - band magnitude ( @xmath6 ) , rest - frame time lag ( @xmath7 , in days ) , and wavelength ( @xmath8 , in  ) ,",
    "the mean dependence of the sf on these quantities was inferred by i04 to be @xmath9 \\left(\\frac{\\delta    t_{rf}}{\\lambda_{rf}}\\right)^c \\rm mag , \\label{eq : i04}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "a qualitatively similar result was obtained by vb04 .",
    "kozowski et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , in the first large study of the mid - ir structure functions of quasars , also found lower variability for higher luminosities and longer wavelengths , but the temporal slope of the ensemble structure functions were significantly steeper than in the optical .",
    "in addition , there is evidence for a turnover in the sf on long time lags ( i04 ; rengstorf et al .",
    "2006 ; wold et al .",
    "studies by de vries et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and sesar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using sdss combined with earlier palomar observatory sky survey measurements for 40,000 sdss quasars constrained quasar continuum variability on time scales of 10 to 50 years in the observer s frame .",
    "they report that the characteristic time scale , which in this context is the time lag above which the sf flattens to a constant value , is of order 1 year in the quasar rest frame . using a shot - noise light curve model , de vries et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found evidence for multiple variability time scales in long - term ensemble variability measurements , while collier & peterson ( 2001 ) found a wide range of different time scales in their analysis of individual light curves , and even evidence for multiple time scales in a single active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "these analyses of ensemble variability are based on a fundamental assumption that photometric observations at two epochs for a large number of quasars will reveal the same statistical properties as well - sampled light curves for individual objects .",
    "this assumption has been tested by macleod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) using light curves for spectroscopically confirmed quasars observed roughly 50 times over 8 years in sdss stripe 82 ( s82 ) .",
    "they found that while the mean sf for individual sources is consistent with eq .",
    "[ eq : i04 ] , the contribution of the mean trends to the observed dispersion in variability properties is minor compared to an intrinsic stochasticity of unknown origin .",
    "further investigation of this stochastic behavior is one of the main goals of this study .    in order to better understand the relationship between the two types of data analyses ( individual versus ensemble quasar variability ) , and to begin linking to physical models , we apply the damped random walk model to the @xmath13 light curves of @xmath09,000 spectroscopically confirmed sdss s82 quasars .",
    "this large sample greatly benefits from the robust , accurate , five - band sdss photometry .",
    "we estimate the variability parameters following koz10 , who demonstrated that their approach is more statistically powerful than the forecasting methods used by kbs09 .",
    "we also note that both the koz10 and kbs09 approaches are much faster than that used by schmidt et al .",

    "we also estimate the sensitivity of our results to variations in the slope of the model power spectrum on long time scales . in section  [ sec :",
    "trends ] , we describe the relationship between the long - term variability parameters and physical parameters such as wavelength , absolute magnitude , black hole mass , and eddington ratio . using these results , we also provide a prescription for simulating mock quasar light curves . in section  [ sec :",

    "we model the time variability of quasars as a stochastic process described by the exponential covariance matrix @xmath15 between times @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "as detailed by kbs09 and koz10 , this corresponds to a damped random walk ( more specifically , an ornstein - uhlenbeck process ) with a damping time scale @xmath2 , also called the characteristic time scale , and a long - term standard deviation of variability used here is related to the @xmath18 used in kbs09 ( @xmath19 ) and the parameter @xmath20 used in koz10 as @xmath21 . ]",

    ", we express the long - term variability in terms of the structure function ( sf ) in order to relate to our previous studies and to those of two - epoch samples . the first order",

    "1992 ) , where the autocorrelation function for a damped random walk is @xmath23 ( eq .",
    "a6 in kbs09 ) .",
    "this acf results in the structure function fit to the long - term sdss - poss data in sesar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , see their eq .  5 , is similar but not identical to the functional form given by eq .",
    "[ eq : sfdt ] . ] : @xmath24 asymptotic values of the sf at large and small @xmath5 are @xmath25 the form @xmath26 is equivalent to a power spectral distribution @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( see appendix of bauer et al .  2009 ; kbs09 ) .",
    "the sf at small time lags is therefore equivalent to a power spectral distribution @xmath29 .",
    "we adopt @xmath3 and @xmath2 as our two main variability model parameters .",
    "equipped with a statistical description of quasar variability , we generate well - sampled light curves in order to 1 ) demonstrate the relationship between our variability parameters and the traditional sf analyses of many previous works , and 2 ) to estimate the systematic effects that the sampling rate and light curve length have on the fitted parameters .",
    "the latter is especially important because the s82 data are fairly sparse . as shown below and in section  [ sec : tests ] , these indeed have a large impact .",
    "a light curve is generated using only three input parameters : @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and the mean value of the light curve , @xmath30 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath31 at a given timestep @xmath5 from a previous value @xmath32 is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean and variance given by @xmath33 ( eqs .",
    "a4 and a5 in kbs09 ) .",
    "the asymptotic variance of the time series is then @xmath34 . the top panel of figure  [ fig : splittest ] shows a segment of a well - sampled light curve generated using @xmath35 days , @xmath36 mag , and a time sampling of @xmath37 .",
    "the structure function , @xmath38 , is computed by collecting the differences in magnitude for all points in the light curve separated by a given time lag , @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of magnitude differences ( @xmath39 ) is gaussian by construction , and the rms of the @xmath39 distribution is the @xmath40 value for that time lag .    when fitting values for @xmath3 and @xmath2 for a given light curve , the length of time that it spans plays an important role .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : splittest ] , the sf computed for the full light curve length of @xmath41 ( 82 years ) is much smoother than that computed for three equal sections , each spanning 27 years .",
    "therefore , the determination of variability parameters for s82 quasars will be affected by their light curve lengths , which are typically @xmath42 . when the light curve is too short , it is easy to overestimate @xmath2 because there is no information on the time scale of the break ( where @xmath38 flattens to @xmath3 ) .",
    "the model will reproduce the observed variance in the light curve by overestimating @xmath43 , and therefore @xmath44 is the more robustly estimated model parameter when @xmath2 can not be well - determined .      before interpreting the form of @xmath38 , we summarize the major differences between our s82 analysis and previous studies based on ensemble structure functions .",
    "the ensemble structure function is computed using only a few observations of many quasars , combining all magnitude differences to find @xmath38 .",
    "using an ensemble approach is beneficial because it enables one to constrain the average variability properties when it is difficult to constrain such quantities for individual quasars . indeed ,",
    "even with well - sampled light curves , spurious breaks in the individual sfs are common ( emmanoulopoulos , mchardy , & uttley 2010 ) . however , in previous works ( e.g. , i04 ; de vries et al .",
    "2005 ) , the characteristic time scale is defined as the time lag at which the ensemble @xmath38 flattens to a constant value , and thus it represents some complex average over the intrinsic @xmath2 distribution . in contrast , by applying a stochastic model to the individual s82 light curves , we are relatively insensitive to time sampling issues ( for details , see kbs09 ) , and we obtain a model fit for every quasar in each filter described by the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 .    a power law fit to @xmath38 has previously been a common way to describe @xmath38 , and even to reject certain classes of models ( e.g. , kawaguchi et al .",
    "1998 ; vb04 ; i04 ) .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : splittest ] shows that the best - fit power law index is extremely sensitive to the fitted range of @xmath45 .",
    "for example , for @xmath46 , @xmath38 is well fit by a power law with an index of @xmath00.5 , while for @xmath47 , we obtain a strongly biased power law index of @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , each quasar has its own values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the ensemble structure function is a convolution of the individual structure functions with their distribution in parameters , @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( eq .  [ eq : sfdt ] ) is the structure function at time @xmath5 for a quasar with variability parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the ensemble structure function is only indirectly related to the structure function for any particular quasar , and results based on fitting a power law to observed ensemble structure functions should be interpreted with caution .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) provides homogeneous and deep ( @xmath51 ) photometry in five passbands ( @xmath13 , fukugita et al .",

    "these data were obtained in yearly `` seasons '' about 2 - 3 months long over the last decade , and the cadence effectively samples time scales from days to years .",
    "the light curve lengths are effectively shorter than the actual period of the survey because the better - sampled supernova observations begin about 5 years into the survey . because some observations were obtained in non - photometric conditions , improved calibration techniques have been applied to sdss s82 data by ivezi et al .",

    "masses were estimated from emission line widths ( h@xmath59 for @xmath60 , mgii for @xmath61 , and civ for @xmath62 ) .",

    "2009 ) .",
    "the damped random walk model was fit to all available @xmath13 light curves for @xmath63 s82 quasars .",
    "summed over 5 bands , there are @xmath64 best - fit values of the characteristic ( damping ) time scale @xmath2 and long - term structure function @xmath3 . for further analysis , we select light curves that satisfy the following criteria :    1 .",
    "first , we remove light curves with fewer than 10 observations .",
    "the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : cuts ] shows the distribution of the number of observations ( @xmath65 ) per light curve before this cut , which reduces our sample to @xmath66 . at a given @xmath65 ,",
    "the distribution of the ratio of light curve length to @xmath2 is similar to that at all other values of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , any systematic effects of @xmath65 on derived parameter distributions should be small .",
    "we then require that the stochastic model must provide a better fit than uncorrelated noise .",
    "following koz10 , we select light curves with a likelihood improvement over simply broadening the measurement errors of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the likelihood of the stochastic model and @xmath69 is that for the noise solution where @xmath70 .",
    "the top - right panel of figure  [ fig : cuts ] shows the distribution of @xmath71 before this cut , which removes 14% of @xmath57 and @xmath58 light curves , whose photometric errors are larger . about 7% of our light curves ( 82% of which are @xmath57 or @xmath58 band )",
    "are removed in this step , reducing our total to @xmath72 .",
    "3 .   finally , we remove cases where @xmath2 is merely a lower limit due to the length of the light curve .",
    "we define @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the likelihood that @xmath75 , indicating that the light curve length is too short to accurately measure @xmath2 .",
    "the bottom - left panel shows a peak at @xmath76 , and we exclude these objects by requiring that @xmath77 .",
    "most ( 95% ) of the rejected light curves have lengths @xmath78 ; 76% have @xmath79 days , and 64% have @xmath80 mag .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that as the @xmath2 value becomes long and uncertain , the model will necessarily overestimate @xmath3 in order to keep the overall light curve rms fixed ( see section  [ sec : modellcs ] ) .",
    "+ the rejected light curves tend to be higher redshift quasars because stronger time dilation leads to shorter rest - frame light curve lengths , making it increasingly difficult to constrain long rest - frame @xmath2 . this criterion removes 22% of our sample , leaving a total of @xmath81 values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . because we are limited by the duration of the s82 survey ,",
    "this is a significant loss , and therefore our final @xmath2 distribution is biased low , but the bias should not be significant considering our results in section  [ sec : tests ] .",
    "the resulting light curves are well - fit by the stochastic model , as can be seen from the distribution of @xmath82 shown in the bottom - right panel in figure  [ fig : cuts ] , where @xmath83 is the number of degrees of freedom . the expected gaussian distribution with rms @xmath84 is also shown in the panel , where we have averaged over the @xmath83 distribution of the light curves .",
    "the observed distribution is centered at @xmath85 .",
    "this difference is some combination of errors in the estimated errors , outliers in the light curves , and any poorly modeled physics .",
    "koz10 noted a similar difference in their analysis of ogle light curves .",
    "only 5% of the light curves have @xmath86 , confirming that most quasars are variable ( at the @xmath87 level ) , and that a damped random walk is a good description of quasar variability .",
    "we assume the variability to be intrinsic to the quasars and convert the time scales to the rest frame ( dividing by @xmath88 ) before further analysis .",
    "the long - term structure function should be independent of redshift other than through evolution in physical parameters , and this view is confirmed by kbs09 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pardist ] shows the distributions in @xmath3 and rest - frame @xmath2 found for the s82 quasars . if we consider only the brighter ( @xmath89 ) quasars , based on the best - fit mean magnitude , the distributions are generally similar but biased towards lower asymptotic amplitudes ( peaked at 0.12 mag ) .",
    "the distributions are consistent with what was found in kbs09 and koz10 ; however , in these studies , there are not as many objects with runaway ( @xmath75 ) time scales because of the improved time sampling of the ogle survey and many of the light curves in the kbs09 sample .",
    "also , the observed - frame @xmath2 distribution lacks many of the short time scales observed in koz10 ; this is likely due to either the better time sampling of the ogle light curves or unrecognized stellar contamination in their sample .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : pardist ] shows that the best - fit variability parameters are highly correlated with each other , indicating that quasars with larger asymptotic amplitudes of variability also have longer characteristic time scales .",
    "we fit a power law slope of @xmath90 dex / dex for all 33,112 data points , and this trend persists within each @xmath13 band as well .",
    "note that a correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is expected even if @xmath2 is independent of the driving amplitude of short - term variations , @xmath44 .",
    "since the power law slope of @xmath91 is steeper than that expected if @xmath2 and @xmath20 are independent ( @xmath00.2 , see below ) , the time scale must also be correlated with the amplitude of short - term variability .",
    "we confirm that this correlation is intrinsic , rather than an artifact of short light curve lengths , in section  [ sec : tests ] .",
    "the approximate values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 can often be guessed from light curves by simple visual inspection .",
    "figure  [ fig : lceg1 ] shows representative light curves from several regions of @xmath92 space , indicated by stars in figure  [ fig : pardist ] .",
    "the weighted average of all model light curves consistent with the data is also shown , and the `` error snake '' is the @xmath93 range of those light curves about this mean .",
    "the top panel shows a light curve with a relatively short @xmath2  this is due to the large amount of variability within each season ( i.e.  each grouping of points ) , as compared to that in the second panel , which shows a curve with a much larger @xmath2 .",
    "the third panel shows a light curve with a relatively low @xmath3 , while the bottom panel shows one with a larger @xmath3 , as can be seen by the larger difference in median @xmath55 band magnitude between about 10 and 11 years .",
    "note the outlier in the third panel : outliers such as these are generally responsible for higher values of @xmath82 .",
    "the ( data@xmath94model ) brightness difference provides a convenient way to identify outliers , and they may be an indicator of variability behavior not captured by the damped random walk model",
    ". however , they may also be caused by occasional non - gaussian photometric errors and thus their analysis requires a detailed and careful study ( e.g. , by utilizing control samples of appropriately chosen nearby non - variable stars ) .",
    "since the model provides satisfactory fits for the overwhelming majority of objects ( see section  [ sec : cuts ] ) , we do not further investigate such outliers in this work .",
    "we have also searched for periodic signals in observed light curves and did not find any convincing cases .",
    "this analysis is summarized in the appendix .",
    "there are three contributions to the scatter in the best - fit variability parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "first , the fitting errors , including those due to insufficient time sampling and light curve length , will introduce some scatter .",
    "second , trends with physical parameters ( see section  [ sec : trends ] ) result in a certain distribution width",
    ". there may also be scatter due to other sources of variability that are not captured by the model , such as flares , or other activity related to radio emission , for example . here , we carry out two tests in order to understand how the best - fit parameters are affected by the limited data sampling of s82 .    since the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 seen in figure  [ fig : pr_tau_sf ]",
    "might be expected if the light curves are not sampled over sufficiently long periods of time ( see section  [ sec : modellcs ] ) , we first test whether the correlation is real or simply an artifact .",
    "we generated light curves as described in section  [ sec : modellcs ] using the time sampling and photometric uncertainties of the s82 data .",
    "for each object , the input parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution in @xmath97 and @xmath98 limited by the dotted rectangle in the left panel of figure  [ fig : sftau_fake ] .",
    "these artificial light curves are then fit to obtain @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and the resulting distribution is shown by the contours in figure  [ fig : sftau_fake ] .",
    "the open circles show data points that do not satisfy @xmath87 ( 3% of all input points )  these are concentrated at small @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the closed circles show those that do not satisfy @xmath77 ( 21% of all input points )  these have been smeared to large values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 . after omitting points with @xmath101 and @xmath102 ,",
    "the distribution of the output estimates is similar to the input distribution and shows no strong correlation between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this suggests that the correlation in figure  [ fig : pr_tau_sf ] is largely real , and not an artifact of sampling and fitting procedures .",
    "these results also justify the selection cuts outlined in section  [ sec : cuts ] .",

    "however , for the s82 sampling , it is difficult to distinguish between the red and blue lines ( @xmath114 and @xmath112 ) , and the ( input ) observed distribution is similar to both",
    ". therefore , within the limited s82 sampling , we are unable to distinguish reliably between a damped random walk and a @xmath126 psd on long time scales .",
    "next , we discuss correlations between each of the variability parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the four available physical parameters : rest - frame wavelength ( @xmath8 ) , redshift ( @xmath58 ) , absolute i - band magnitude ( @xmath6 ) , and black hole mass ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "it is important to fit a multiple regression to each of the physical parameters , functions of the form @xmath128 , because of the correlations between physical parameters .",
    "for example , when searching for a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath127 , one must take into account that a more luminous quasar hosts a more massive black hole ( e.g. , kollmeier et al .",

    "a similar example is the well - known luminosity - redshift ( @xmath129@xmath58 ) degeneracy seen in flux - limited samples of quasars .",
    "magnitude limits result in the illusion that only the most luminous quasars are seen at high @xmath58 , and therefore the observed @xmath129 increases with @xmath58 independent of reality .",
    "having a large sample size helps to alleviate these degeneracies .",
    "for example , one can look for trends using 2-dimensional grids in any two physical parameters of interest .",
    "the numbers of data points per two - dimensional bin of @xmath6 and redshift , and similarly for @xmath6 and @xmath127 , are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : hiddensys ] .",
    "the two left panels of figure  [ fig : hiddensys ] show the selection effect that quasars at higher redshift must have higher luminosities to be included in the survey . from the two - dimensional distribution in the top - left panel",
    ", we can see that this @xmath129@xmath58 degeneracy is essentially independent of @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore , shorter rest - frame wavelengths are probed at higher redshifts for two reasons : first , quasars emitting at shorter rest wavelengths must be at higher redshifts in order to be observed within the @xmath13 filters , and second , quasars at high redshifts are closer to their eddington limit as a result of the @xmath129@xmath58 degeneracy , and possibly cosmological downsizing ( e.g. , kollmeier et al .",
    "therefore , any dependence of variability on wavelength must be accounted for when considering a dependence with redshift ( or luminosity ) .",
    "when fitting power laws to a large number of data points throughout this paper , we fit to the median values in each bin of the independent variable , where all bins have the same number of data points @xmath1 .",
    "the errors in the medians are computed as 0.93(iqr)@xmath130 , where iqr is the 25% ",
    "75% interquartile range , and these constrain our formal errors in the power law slopes .",
    "we start by examining the wavelength dependence of the variability parameters .",
    "since there are multiple bands for each quasar , this dependence can be determined for individual sources for which @xmath58 , @xmath6 , and @xmath127 are fixed .",
    "the rest - frame wavelength is found by dividing the observed bandpasses ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135   for @xmath13 , respectively ) by @xmath88 .",

    "this suggests an additional source of variability , such as a dependence on luminosity or on @xmath127 in addition to the dependence on @xmath181 .",
    "moreover , if we ignore this additional source , the result that @xmath3 depends on @xmath181 supports a scenario where the amplitude of the optical variability is determined by the accretion rate ( see discussion in wilhite et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "if the eddington ratio is a proxy for the quasar s age ( e.g. , martini & schneider 2003 ) , then a lower eddington ratio , and thus a larger amplitude of variability , could indicate a dwindling fuel supply and a more variable rate at which it is supplied to the black hole .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the observed variability is due to fluctuations in the external fuel supply to the disk , because the fluctuation time scales of 10  10,000 days are very short compared to the viscous time scales of @xmath120 ",
    "@xmath187 days that should control large scale changes in the accretion rate .",
    "moreover , these fluctuations in the fueling rate will also be smoothed out and damped as they travel inward , and will likely have effectively disappeared by the time they reach the optical emitting region ( e.g. , see discussion in churazov et al .",
    "2001 ) . instead , the origin of the fluctuations is probably more local .",
    "another possibility is that the dependence on @xmath181 may simply be a reflection of the dependence on wavelength , which in turn depends on the disk radius .",
    "if a higher @xmath181 means a hotter disk , then the optical flux originates at a larger radius . assuming that longer wavelengths are emitted further out in the disk , the lower @xmath3 at longer wavelengths would lead to the anti - correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath181 . in thin disk theory ( e.g. , see frank , king , & raine 2002 ) , the characteristic radius for emission at wavelength @xmath8 scales as @xmath188 , and the thermal time scale is related to the orbital time scale as @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , under the assumption that @xmath2 is related to the thermal time scale , and that variability at wavelength @xmath8 is dominated by the scale @xmath190 , @xmath2 scales with @xmath8 , @xmath127 , and @xmath129 as : @xmath191 since @xmath192 , this means @xmath2 scales as @xmath193 which does not match the observed scaling of @xmath194 .",

    "the variability time scale simply does not show the strong dependence on @xmath8 , @xmath127 , and @xmath129 expected from these simple scalings .",
    "therefore , using this naive scaling , we are not able to relate the observed @xmath2 to either a thermal or viscous time scale of the radius associated with the wavelength of the variability . however , in reality there is a range of radii , which corresponds to a range in time scales , contributing to the observed flux in each band , and this will cause some degree of smoothing . also , the radial regions might overlap for each band , causing a single radius to contribute flux in multiple bandpasses , and this might attenuate some of the dependencies on @xmath8 , @xmath127 , and @xmath129 . finally , our observed power law indices may be biased due to the uncertainty in the bolometric correction .      given the success of the damped random walk model in explaining a large body of observations , it represents a simple quantitative framework for generating mock quasar light curves .",

    "quasars with similar physical parameters can have different characteristic time scales for variability .",
    "it is now clear that the distribution of @xmath2 accounts for most of the scatter in the structure function on short time scales for quasars with similar luminosity , rest wavelength , and time lag , which explains the puzzling results from macleod et al .",
    "results from fitting a power law to observed ensemble structure functions should be interpreted with caution .",
    "the variability time scale is correlated with the long - term rms variability with a slope of @xmath255 dex / dex .",
    "quasars that have large long - term variability amplitudes generally vary on longer characteristic time scales . the amplitude of short term variations is also correlated with @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is unaffected by any time sampling issues in the s82 dataset .",
    "the damped random walk corresponds to a psd proportional to @xmath113 at frequencies @xmath110 , flattening to a constant at lower frequencies . at large @xmath119 ,",
    "the data are in great agreement with @xmath256 . in terms of the structure function",

    "the rest - frame variability parameters show a negligible trend with redshift , suggesting that they are intrinsic to the quasars , and these properties do not evolve over cosmic time for fixed physical parameters of the quasar ( @xmath127 , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 ) .",
    "7 .   for fixed luminosity and black hole mass",
    ", @xmath2 increases with increasing rest - frame wavelength with a power law index of @xmath144 , and @xmath3 decreases with a power law index of @xmath261 .",
    "the latter result is similar to previous findings ( e.g. , macleod et al .",
    "2008 , vb04 ) .",
    "koz10 also observed that the variability increases to shorter @xmath262 , but they kept @xmath2 fixed in their fits . if wavelength is a proxy for radius in the accretion disk , this implies that the characteristic time scales are longer and the variability amplitudes are smaller in the outer regions than in the inner regions .",
    "the long - term variability @xmath3 is strongly anti - correlated with luminosity as found in previous studies such as vb04 , wilhite et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and references therein . by studying the median @xmath3 in the plane of absolute magnitude and black hole mass , we can separate the anti - correlation of amplitude with luminosity from the positive correlation with black hole mass . as suggested in wilhite",
    "et al .  (",
    "2008 ) , these trends may be largely explained if the amplitude of variability is tied to changes in the accretion rate in the disk , and is simply related to the eddington ratio . however , despite the strong anti - correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath181 ( which accounts for most of the dependence on @xmath6 and @xmath127 ) , the exact dependence with @xmath6 and @xmath127 is not consistent with @xmath181 as the sole driver of quasar variability .",
    "the damping time scale @xmath2 appears to be nearly independent of luminosity and correlated with @xmath127 with a power law index of @xmath150 .",
    "the mild discrepancy with the kbs09 result ( 1.0@xmath40.4 ) may be due to the different range of sampled luminosity and black hole mass , as well as contamination by host galaxy emission in many of the very low luminosity systems they consider ( see koz10 ) .",
    "while the mean variability parameters can be related to physical parameters , for fixed values of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath127 , there is still a large scatter around the mean values , similar to the variance of the observed distributions .",
    "some of that scatter can be attributed to measurement and fitting errors ( @xmath060% for @xmath2 and @xmath070% for @xmath3 ) , but there is enough evidence for residual stochastic nature of quasar variability .",
    "therefore , it can not be assumed that quasars with similar @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath127 will necessarily have similar variability properties .",
    "the radio - loudest quasars have systematically larger variability amplitude by about 30% , while the distribution of their characteristic time scale is indistinguishable from that of the full sample .",
    "there are no statistically robust differences in the characteristic time scale and variability amplitude between the full sample and a small subsample of quasars detected by rosat .    with this paper , and results from kbs09 and koz10 ,",
    "the ability of the damped random walk model to quantitatively describe quasar variability is well - established . as emphasized by koz10",
    ", this means that variability studies can become fully quantitative because the entire process of identifying and assigning parameters to quasars can be simulated to allow estimates of completeness and parameter biases .",
    "in particular , an important next step is to determine the variability equivalents of luminosity functions , i.e. , the intrinsic distributions of the variability parameters .",
    "while our results represent a good first step in this direction , we caution that a non - negligible fraction of the s82 quasars have indeterminately long time scales .",
    "if , following kbs09 , we identify the characteristic time scale with the thermal time scale , then the next question is whether there are additional time scales ( such as the dynamical or viscous time scale ) , or sources of variability .",
    "for example , blackburne & kochanek  ( 2010 ) recently found evidence for changes in disk size with changes in luminosity using gravitational microlensing .",
    "such searches for additional sources of variability will likely require better sampled light curves and over a longer time scale .",
    "the prospect of advancing these studies of quasar variability now faces a bottleneck .",
    "the s82 quasars have the advantage of sample size , wavelength coverage , and spectroscopy , but the light curves have poor sampling and modest overall lengths , leading to significant problems for accurately estimating @xmath2 when it is long .",
    "the quasars behind the magellanic clouds ( kozowski & kochanek 2009 ) are a smaller sample without spectroscopic confirmation , but have superb , long term light curves that continue to be extended because of the continuing microlensing projects . improving on our present results in the short term",
    "depends on either reviving the monitoring of s82 or spectroscopically confirming the magellanic cloud quasars .",
    "resuming the monitoring of stripe 82 is challenging with the decommissioning of the sdss imaging system .",
    "the best short - term prospects are the pan - starrs project ( kaiser et al .",
    "2002 ) , the palomar - quest project ( schweitzer et al .  2006 ) , or using the decam being built for the dark energy survey ( honscheid et al .",
    "2008 ) . since the challenge is to constrain long time scales , the presence of a multiple - year gap is mainly a complication for ensuring that problems in matching photometric bands are not interpreted as a form of long - term variability .",
    "obtaining spectra of the magellanic cloud quasars is in some ways easier , because the quasar magnitudes and densities are well - suited to the aaomega fiber spectrograph on the aat and , to a lesser degree , the imacs spectrograph on magellan .",
    "the more general , northern monitoring projects such as pan - starrs and palomar - quest will slowly build light curves for essentially all the sdss quasars , but at present their cadences are not ideal ( see schmidt et al .",
    "2010 ) and it will take nearly a decade to build the long duration light curves needed for the analysis . in the long term , observations will be significantly improved with the advent of next - generation sky surveys .",
    "most notably , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , ivezi et al . 2008 ) will obtain accurate , well - sampled light curves for millions of agn .",
    "the observed distribution of rest - frame characteristic time scales for s82 quasars spans the range from about 10 days to 1000 days ( c.f.figure  [ fig : pardist ] ) . to probe the time scales as short as @xmath263 , and assuming a characteristic redshift of 2 , the light curves should be sampled every 3 days in the observer s frame , which is in good agreement with the baseline cadence of lsst . with a 10 year - long survey",
    ", the length of the light curves will be in the range ( 1 - 200)@xmath2 .",
    "a combination of the sdss , pan - starrs , des , and lsst data for @xmath010,000 stripe 82 quasars would span well over two decades , with multi - band photometry obtained for hundreds of epochs , and would represent the best sample to date for studying the optical continuum variability of quasars .",
    "in particular , such a dataset would enable a robust measurement of the low - frequency behavior of their psd ( c.f .",
    "point 5 above ) . for illustration ,",
    "the lsst photometric errors in the @xmath55 band will be @xmath264 mag for @xmath265 , and there are roughly 2 - 3 million agn with @xmath265 in the 20,000 sq .",
    "deg .  covered by the main lsst survey ( see table 10.2 in the lsst science book ; abell et al .  2009 ) . each of these objects will be observed about 1000 times , yielding a database of over 2 billion photometric measurements .",

    "aj , 120 , 1579    although a stochastic process has proven to be an accurate statistical description of quasar light curves , any discovery of periodic behavior ( even of a single source ) would have interesting physical implications .",
    "however , a periodogram can only be used as an indicator of significant periodicity in a signal as compared to pure white noise ( i.e. , having no signal at all ) .",
    "since quasars are genuinely variable , as described by a damped random walk ( i.e. , a red noise process ; see kbs09 ) , one can only evaluate the significance of the periodicity when also allowing for the signal covariance that is also present ( see markwardt et al .",
    "2009 ; gotz et al .  2009 ; cenko et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , as a quick test for outstanding cases of periodicity among the s82 light curves , we analyzed 8,863 light curves for evidence of periodicity using the lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) .",
    "the threshold for considering the strongest peak in the periodogram as candidate evidence for periodicity was set following horne & baliunas ( 1986 ) , with an adopted false alarm probability of 0.05 .",
    "however , this is the threshold for ruling out white noise in favor of periodicity , and therefore provides no information on how a periodic description compares to a colored noise process such as a damped random walk . to determine the latter ,",
    "a different threshold is needed ( see koz10 ) . when adopting the threshold for ruling out white noise in favor of periodic variability , we identify 88 light curves as good candidates .",
    "a close inspection of the period distribution for the full sample and the selected 88 candidates shows important differences : while the full sample displays a fairly flat distribution ranging from 100 days to values exceeding 10,000 days , the period distribution for 88 candidates is bimodal .",
    "the first peak with 22 objects corresponds to aliasing at roughly one - year sampling cadence , while the second peak is centered on periods of about 6 - 7 years , similar to the total length of observations .",
    "we have visually inspected the light curves and phased light curves for all 88 candidates .",
    "it turns out that candidates with proposed periods of the order one year have light curves consistent with aliasing , while those with longer periods typically have only one observed `` oscillation '' that might not be used as robust evidence for periodicity ( six examples are shown in figure  [ fig : periodic_phg ] ) .",
    "therefore , our search for periodic light curves in the s82 quasar sample has not yielded any convincing cases .",
    "again , it is important to note that in cases such as in figure  [ fig : periodic_phg ] , the periodogram indicates that these sources with long @xmath2 are likely to be periodic , not because they show true periodicity , but because it computes the likelihood relative to the wrong null hypothesis ( white noise rather than colored noise ) .",
    "moreover , the fact that @xmath2665% of the light curves exceed the threshold for periodicity being a better description than pure white noise is a further indication that the periodogram is not a very powerful statistic for poorly sampled light curves , since it is clear from the previous sections that quasar light curves are not white noise , but rather are well described by a damped random walk .",
    "in fact , the single `` oscillation '' observed for the best candidate long period objects is entirely expected from colored noise processes such as a damped random walk ( see right panels of figure  [ fig : periodic_phg ] ) .",
    "therefore , this analysis is further evidence that a damped random walk is a good description of quasar light curves ."
