    "during recent years , a new class of experiments in ultracold gases emerged , dedicated to the study of atoms excited to rydberg states @xcite which interact strongly via dipole - dipole or van - der - waals forces .",
    "the most intriguing manifestation of this interaction is the rydberg blockade mechanism @xcite which prevents the excitation of a rydberg atom in the vicinity of an already excited one . on the theory side",
    ", this blockade has been thoroughly studied in the context of quantum information processing @xcite for it is a natural implementation of a state dependent interaction which is essential to devise two qubit gates . moreover",
    ", it has been theoretically shown that the long - ranged character of the interaction can be employed to manipulate whole atomic ensembles by just a single control atom @xcite .",
    "very recently , the state - dependent dynamics between two rydberg atoms , spatially separated by several micrometers , was observed experimentally @xcite .    in the context of gases , a first experimental indication of the strong rydberg - rydberg interaction was the non - linear behavior of the number of excited atoms as a function of increasing laser power and atomic density @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown that , in the case of a dense gas , the rydberg blockade gives rise to the formation of coherent collective excitations - so - called superatoms @xcite . due to the strong interaction , the timescale of the excitation dynamics of a rydberg gas is typically much shorter than those of the external dynamics . as a consequence , such gases can be considered frozen @xcite in a given configuration and the evolution of rydberg excitations is usually described by a spin model @xcite , where the spin up / down state represents a rydberg / ground state atom . unlike in a typical solid state system , there are no significant dissipative processes which make the system assume its ground state over the typical experimental timescale .",
    "therefore , one can regard the dynamics as fully coherent @xcite and the time - evolution of quantities like the mean number of rydberg excitations is expected to depend crucially on the initial state .",
    "an experiment , however , consists of many successive measurements which are performed for different configurations ( initial states ) of the atomic gas , i.e. changing positions of the atoms . hence , the results of many experimental realizations have to be averaged in order find expectation values of physical quantities .    in the present work we study the excitation properties of a rydberg gas in a particularly structured and symmetric scenario . in our setup , a large number @xmath0 of ground state atoms per site",
    "are homogeneously distributed over a ring lattice @xcite . at most a single rydberg atom per site",
    "can be excited via a resonant laser that is switched on instantaneously . due to the underlying lattice",
    "the atomic configuration remains unchanged for any experimental realization and no averaging in the above sense is required .",
    "the atomic motion is considered frozen on relevant time scale . in the framework of the perfect blockade regime , we study the temporal evolution of the rydberg excitation number , the formation of correlations in the rydberg density and the entanglement properties in lattices with up to 25 sites .",
    "we demonstrate that the dynamics of this system is divided into short and long time domains which are , respectively , independent and dependent on the lattice size .",
    "our calculations are numerically exact in the limit of the perfect rydberg blockade and therefore might serve as reference for numerical methods that are developed for treating effectively one - dimensional many - particle systems .",
    "effects that go beyond this regime are treated by second order perturbation theory , i.e. by a hamiltonian which is obtained by adiabatically eliminating highly excited energy levels .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] we derive an effective hamiltonian which describes the rydberg excitation dynamics of atoms confined to a ring lattice . section [ sec : symmetries ] is dedicated to the discussion of the symmetry properties of the system and the consequent arising simplification of the numerical calculation .",
    "the regime of the perfect blockade is thoroughly studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : perfect ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : non - perfect ] we discuss the adiabatic elimination procedure which we use to account for effects that go beyond the perfect blockade and perform a comparison of the results obtained by both approaches .",
    "the conclusion and outlook are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a gas of bosonic atoms that is confined to a large spacing optical ring lattice with @xmath1 sites with periodicity @xmath2 .",
    "such lattices have been proposed to be created by means of two interfering laser beams with @xmath1 being typically of the order of 20 @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is also a way to create a ring lattice approximatively in a standard rectangular large spacing optical lattice @xcite which is generated by crossed laser beams . to this end",
    "one can remove atoms from unwanted sites by employing the electron beam technique presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , thereby cutting out a ring .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume an uniform and large atomic density , i.e. the same number of ground state atoms @xmath0 per site .",
    "the atoms populate the ground state of each lattice site , which for the @xmath3-th one is described by the wannier function @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents the spatial coordinates .",
    "we assume no hopping and hence no particle exchange between the sites .",
    "the atoms are modeled as a two - level system : the ground state @xmath6 and the rydberg state @xmath7 .",
    "experimentally these two levels are usually coupled by a two - photon transition . here , we assume , without any loss of generality , that they are coupled resonantly by a laser of rabi frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) represent the creation ( annihilation ) of a ground and a rydberg state atom at the @xmath3-th site , respectively . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the rydberg atoms experience the same trapping potential than the ground state atoms .",
    "this requirement is , however , not crucial as the typical timescale of the electronic excitation dynamics which we are going to study is much smaller than the dephasing time due to different trapping potentials experienced by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "since we are working in the limit of a large number of ground state atoms , @xmath14 , contained in each site , they can be treated as a classical field and we can replace @xmath10 and @xmath12 by @xmath15 .",
    "this yields the hamiltonian @xmath16 where we assume a relative phase equal to @xmath17 between the condensates confined to different sites .",
    "moreover , we neglect radiative decay .",
    "this is justified because the typical timescale of the excitation dynamics is given by the inverse of the collective rabi frequency @xmath18 which can easily exceed tens of mhz .",
    "we will later see that due to the rydberg blockade at most @xmath19 rydberg atoms will be excited on the ring . as a consequence , the time for the first emission of a photon scales in the worst case like @xmath20 , with the single rydberg atom decay rate @xmath21 .",
    "thus , for the ring sizes under consideration the condition @xmath22 can be met .",
    "let us now discuss the interaction between the rydberg atoms .",
    "we focus here on the van - der - waals interaction which is given as @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the interparticle distance .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that even this short - ranged , i.e. quickly decaying , interaction can significantly affect the excitation dynamics of atoms which are several @xmath25 m apart .",
    "this is rooted in the large value of the coefficient @xmath26 , which grows proportional to @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the principal quantum number of the excited level @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the rydberg particle number operator and @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the spatial extension of the wannier functions @xmath32 is much smaller than the lattice spacing @xmath33 . in this case",
    "we can write @xmath34 , where we make the assumption that the range of interactions is much smaller than the radius of the ring lattice . moreover",
    ", we assume that the on - site interaction is much larger than any other in the system , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that a double occupancy of a single site is ruled out and hence @xmath36 has the two eigenvalues @xmath17 and @xmath37 .",
    "within these approximations and after introducing the energy scale @xmath38 the hamiltonian reads @xmath39\\label{eq : working_hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the maximal range of the interactions is given by @xmath41 , with @xmath42 a positive integer .",
    "the value of @xmath42 depends on the features of the considered system , such as the lattice spacing and the strength of the interaction .",
    "if the interaction rapidly decays as the distance is enhanced only a few neighboring sites interact .",
    "since for the van - der - waals potential @xmath43 is 64 times smaller than @xmath44 , our study is focused on the @xmath45 case .    without the possibility of a double occupancy",
    ", the operator @xmath46 can be interpreted to create a superatom on the @xmath3-th site , i.e. a symmetric superposition of all possible single atom excitations on that site .",
    "this is done with a rate @xmath47 . in this spirit",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] ) describes the local dynamical creation and annihilation of such superatoms and their interaction .",
    "this hamiltonian can be equivalently formulated as a spin model as it is done in refs .",
    "our goal is to study the dynamics of this system with the vacuum state @xmath48 ( such that @xmath49 ) serving as initial state . to that purpose",
    ", we have to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] ) and we perform this task by making use of a basis composed by all possible configurations in the ring . for an increasing site number @xmath1 ,",
    "the exact solution of this problem becomes quickly intractable as the dimension of total the hilbert grows as @xmath50 . by exploiting the symmetries of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] ) we can show , however , that the dimension of the subspace in which the evolution takes place is significantly reduced .",
    "there are two symmetry operations on a ring lattice which are of interest in our system : cyclic shifts by @xmath51 sites and the reversal of the order of the lattice sites .",
    "the former is represented by the operators @xmath52 with @xmath53 where @xmath54 , while the latter operation is the parity and is denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "the action of these operations on the creation and annihilation operators is defined through @xmath56 from which follows that @xmath55 and all @xmath52 are unitary , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under these operations , i.e. @xmath59=\\left[h , r\\right]=0 $ ] .",
    "let us now focus on the vacuum state @xmath48 , where no rydberg atom is excited .",
    "this is an eigenstate of _ all _ cyclic shifts and the reversal operator with eigenvalue 1 : @xmath60 only a small subset of the @xmath50 states , spanning the whole hilbert space , actually has these properties .",
    "each of these maximally symmetric states can be understood as a superposition of all states that are equivalent under rotation and reversal of the sites .",
    "since the hamiltonian conserves the symmetries of the initial state , the evolution of the system will take place in the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the maximally symmetric states . by using these states ,",
    "the dimension of the problem is dramatically reduced .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 the dimension of the basis decreases from @xmath62 down to @xmath63 . for our computations",
    "we need an algorithm to quickly generate the maximally symmetric states among which the evolution takes place .",
    "such an algorithm is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , these states are called bracelets , and are recursively generated in an optimal way .",
    "the amount of cpu time grows only proportional to the number of bracelets produced .",
    "we will consider from now on the case @xmath45 if not explicitly said otherwise , i.e. only neighboring sites interact .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] ) is then governed by two energy scales : the one associated to the laser excitation @xmath64 , i.e. the collective rabi frequency @xmath38 and the one related to the rydberg - rydberg interaction @xmath65 , given by @xmath66 .    ) for @xmath45 .",
    "the spectrum consists of highly degenerate subspaces which are labeled by @xmath67 energetically separated by @xmath68 .",
    "the laser ( @xmath64 ) causes an energy splitting of the degenerate levels .",
    "in addition , it couples states belonging to a given @xmath67-subspace and connects subspaces with @xmath69.,width=188 ]    the spectrum of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath65 decomposes into @xmath70 degenerate subspaces of energy @xmath71 with @xmath72 counting the number of pairs of neighboring excitations .",
    "the laser hamiltonian @xmath64 is switched on instantaneously and drives the dynamics within a given @xmath67-subspace and couples subspaces with @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "the timescale associated with the evolution inside a @xmath67-subspace is @xmath74 , whereas the typical time of inter - subspace transitions is given by @xmath75 .",
    "we consider here the regime in which @xmath76 , i.e. , the interaction energy of two neighboring rydberg atoms is much larger than the collective rabi frequency and hence @xmath77 . for the van - der - waals case , this condition is @xmath78 .",
    "the physical initial state is the vacuum , @xmath79 which belongs to the subspace with @xmath80 . in our approximation",
    "we neglect the coupling between this subspace and those including higher excitations .",
    "this is the perfect blockade approach , which is valid for @xmath81 , i.e. the time it takes to perform a transition between adjacent @xmath67-subspaces .",
    "the restriction to the @xmath80 subspace leads to a further reduction of the dimension of hilbert space in which the temporal evolution takes place .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 the number of states to be considered in the basis set expansion decreases from @xmath63 to @xmath82 . this is to be compared to the @xmath83 states which span the entire hilbert space of the system .",
    "the laser hamiltonian @xmath64 couples states in the hilbert space whose number of excitations differ by one .",
    "the corresponding maximally symmetric states and the coupling between them by means of @xmath64 can be graphically illustrated as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "the way these states are coupled is qualitatively similar for different lattice sizes so , for simplicity reasons , we discuss here the lattice with @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] the states are denoted by the number of rydberg excitation , and a subscript is added when more than one configuration with the same excitation number is possible .",
    "note that , for an even ( odd ) number of sites the maximal number of rydberg atoms in one of these states is @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , e.g. @xmath86 for @xmath87 sites .",
    "in which the time - evolution takes place . in each column a subspace of a given number of rydberg excitations is shown , see text for further information .",
    "the laser ( hamiltonian @xmath64 ) couples only states belonging to adjacent subspaces .",
    "the coupling strength ( transition probability ) between the individual states is encoded in the colors.,width=321 ]    starting from the vacuum , there are several excitations paths with different probabilities that connect the states .",
    "the larger the amount of rydberg atoms , the more constraints are found to allocate the next excitation . as a consequence , we encounter several excitation paths that do not reach the state with the maximal number of rydberg excitations , but end in others , such as the @xmath88 and @xmath89 states for @xmath61 .",
    "the features of these frustrated states strongly depend on the lattice size , and their amount increases as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "in particular , their existence provokes quantitative differences in the dynamics of two lattices with different @xmath1-value for large times .",
    "this is reflected in the time - evolution of all quantities we are going to study throughout this work .",
    "the dynamics can be always divided into two different domains . for short times , @xmath90 the behavior is universal , i.e. , independent of the size of the lattice , whereas for longer times a dependence on @xmath1 is observed .      the reduced density matrix of two neighboring sites is needed to investigate the temporal evolution of local properties such as the mean density of rydberg atoms or the entanglement between two adjacent sites .",
    "since the wavefunction @xmath91 is spanned in the subspace of fully symmetric states , all sites are indistinguishable and we can take @xmath37 and @xmath92 as representative adjacent lattice sites .",
    "the two - sites reduced density matrix is obtained from the density matrix of the full system @xmath93 by performing the partial trace over all the remaining sites , @xmath94 the basis for the two - sites states is @xmath95 .",
    "the restriction to the fully symmetric subspace imposes @xmath96 and @xmath97 , while the perfect blockade prevents the excitation of atoms in two neighboring sites and hence the entries @xmath98 and @xmath99 are zero for @xmath100 . as a consequence",

    "we thereby derive an effective hamiltonian by dividing the eigenstates of @xmath65 into two sets , characterized by their respective quantum number @xmath67 .",
    "the first set of states is formed by the subspace @xmath80 , whereas the second one contains the rest of energetically high - lying excitations . in this framework",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the projectors on the subspaces with energy @xmath80 and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "a general wavefunction can be decomposed as @xmath193 and the time - dependent schrdinger equation reads : @xmath194 due to the large energetic gap between the different subspaces and since the initial state is the vacuum , the transition probability to states with @xmath195 is very small .",
    "thus , we can introduce an approximation assuming that the time variation of @xmath196 is very small and can therefore be neglected , i.e. @xmath197 .",
    "hence , the equation of motion ( [ eq : sch1_ad ] ) is reduced to @xmath198 note that , in this expression , @xmath199 is the hamiltonian within the perfect blockade regime .",
    "whereas , the second term provides the first correction to this hamiltonian and represents the contribution of the couplings between the @xmath80 and @xmath188 subspaces . in practice , @xmath64 only couples the @xmath80 subspace and those with @xmath200 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath201 where the subscript @xmath55 denotes the energetic levels with @xmath202 , and the @xmath203 represent the part of the hamiltonian that couples the states of the subspaces with @xmath204 and @xmath205 . in expression ( [ eq : h_ad ] ) , @xmath206 can be decomposed into the sum of a diagonal matrix , @xmath207 , including the interaction between the subspaces , and a full matrix containing the couplings @xmath208 , @xmath209 the inverse of this matrix can be approximated by @xmath210 where we have used the neumann series @xmath211 for a square matrix @xmath212 whose norm satisfies that @xmath213 . since @xmath214 for any @xmath215 , this condition is accomplished for @xmath216 . finally , we obtain the following expression for the effective hamiltonian @xmath217 where we only consider the first three terms and neglect higher order corrections .",
    "let us now discuss the regime of validity of the approximate hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_effective ] ) . to this end",
    "it is instructive to study a case in which the full hamiltonian ( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] ) is numerically tractable .",
    "this however , can only be done for a small number of sites . in the absence of the laser the eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] )",
    "are those of @xmath65 , i.e. the highly degenerate @xmath67-manifolds .",
    "as soon as the laser is turned on this degeneracy is lifted and all the @xmath67 manifolds split up . however ,",
    "if @xmath187 is sufficiently large the manifolds are still well separated .    ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath218 .",
    "the parameters are chosen such that the individual @xmath67-manifolds are still recognizable .",
    "the inset shows a magnified view of the manifolds with @xmath219 , which are broadened by the interaction with the laser .",
    ", width=321 ]    this regime is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] where we show a histogram of the eigenenergies ( density of states ) for a lattice with @xmath220 and @xmath218 . since in this case",
    "the system can contain at most @xmath221 pairs of consecutive rydberg atoms , we observe @xmath222 manifolds , i.e. @xmath223 . the energetic separation between the central states of two neighboring subspaces is given by @xmath187 . a magnified view of the spectral structure for the low - lying excitations is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] . within the framework of the adiabatic elimination",
    "the contribution of the @xmath224 and @xmath92 manifolds is included up to order @xmath225 in the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_effective ] ) .",
    "the validity of this approximation is restricted to parameter regimes in which states belonging to different manifolds are energetically well - separated , e.g. two adjacent manifolds must not overlap . for @xmath220 , @xmath218 is the minimal value needed to ensure this separation . for",
    "larger lattices sizes , the value of @xmath187 has to be increased since with growing @xmath1 the @xmath67-manifolds contain more and more states and thus become successively broader .",
    "for example , the width of the @xmath80 manifold scales proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of a ring with @xmath226 sites in the framework of the adiabatic elimination using @xmath227 and @xmath228 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : adiabatic ] and [ fig : g2_adiabatic ] we show the rydberg density and a density - density correlation function ( for @xmath140 ) and compare them with the results obtained within the perfect blockade approximation .",
    "the occurring deviations are small .",
    "only minor differences are observed at large times , and we encounter relative errors below @xmath229 and @xmath230 for @xmath227 and @xmath228 , respectively .     computed with the perfect blockade treatment , and with the adiabatic elimination scheme using @xmath231.,width=321 ]     as a function of time for @xmath226 computed with the perfect blockade treatment , and with the adiabatic elimination scheme using @xmath231.,width=321 ]    the results show that the approximated inclusion of higher @xmath67-subspaces in the dynamics does only lead to small quantitative changes in the behavior of the investigated quantities . as anticipated ,",
    "the deviations reduce significantly as @xmath187 is increased .",
    "more qualitative differences are expected to occur if the @xmath232-tail of the rydberg - rydberg interaction is properly accounted for .",
    "in this work we have performed a numerical analysis of the laser - driven rydberg excitation dynamics of atoms confined to a ring lattice . by exploiting the symmetry properties of the system and employing the assumption of a perfect rydberg blockade we were able to perform numerically exact calculations in lattices with up to n=25 sites .",
    "our findings show that the temporal evolutions of the physical quantities , e.g. the rydberg density and the density - density correlations , can be divided into two domains . for short times",
    ", one observes an n - independent universal behavior with large amplitude oscillations . for longer times , the dynamics is crucially determined by the lattice size and the analyzed quantities appear to assume a quasi steady state with only small temporal fluctuations .",
    "moreover , we studied the evolution of the entanglement as well as the quantum and classical correlation of two neighboring sites . by separating the quantum and classical part of the two - party correlation we showed that quantum correlations between neighboring sites decay rapidly as time passes .",
    "in addition , the entanglement between neighboring sites turned out to be weak in the long time limit after a quick initial increase .",
    "we eventually relaxed the perfect blockade condition by taking into account higher excitation subspaces via adiabatic elimination . propagating the initial vacuum state with",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonian has only small effect on the time evolution of the investigated quantities .",
    "more quantitative changes are expected when including the long - ranged tails of the interatomic interaction potential .",
    "this however requires more powerful numerical methods , such as t - dmrg @xcite , which goes beyond the scope of this work .    in the present work we have been focusing on the dynamical properties of this system .",
    "a next step would be to investigate the corresponding static properties , such as eigenstates and eigenvalues .",
    "however , since physically the system is at @xmath233 in the vacuum state it remains an open question how the eigenstates can be actually accessed , for instance via an adiabatic passage incorporating a time - dependent change of the laser detuning and its rabi frequency .",
    "in addition , a rather natural extension would be to analyze the dynamics of these many - particle systems by means of a two dimensional description . certainly , it is also of interest to explore lattices with different geometries , e.g. square or triangle .",
    "the different underlying symmetries are expected to significantly affect the time evolution of these systems .    financial support by the spanish projects fis2008 - 02380 ( mec ) and fqm0207 , fqm481 , fqm2445 and p06-fqm-01735 ( junta de andaluca ) is gratefully appreciated .",
