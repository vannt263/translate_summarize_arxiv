    "starbursts play a major role in the global process of galaxy formation and evolution . however , despite two decades of intense research on starburst galaxies , our present knowledge of the intrinsic starburst properties is still rather poor and fundamental questions remain to be answered . for example , what is the duration of starbursts ? which type of stellar population is formed during these events ?",
    "is the proportion of massive stars higher in starbursts than in more `` quiet '' star - forming regions ?",
    "observationaly , answering these questions is not an easy task . in this respect the so - called `` wolf - rayet ( w - r ) galaxies",
    "'' may be the ideal laboratories since these objects harbour the most massive stars known , o stars and their descendents w - r stars , which allow to probe the upper part of the initial mass function ( imf ) and the youngest stellar populations .",
    "w - r galaxies are usually defined as `` those galaxies in whose integrated spectra a broad emission feature at  attributed to w - r stars has been detected '' @xcite . in practice , the detection of a broad emission feature at @xmath3 ( the so - called `` w - r bump '' , which possibly includes additional emission lines , cf .",
    "below ) attributed to w - r stars is often simply used .",
    "whereas the initial compilation of conti  @xcite includes 37 galaxies , to date at least 100 such objects are known ( see the compilation of schaerer & contini , 1998 ) .",
    "w - r galaxies are found among emission - line galaxies .",
    "however , the class of w - r galaxies encompasses a wide range of properties and galaxy types . while most of them fall in the category of  galaxies , broad w - r emission lines",
    "have also been detected in more `` exotic '' objects like luminous infrared galaxies ( armus , 1988 ) , seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g.  heckman , 1997 ) and giant cd galaxies , located in the centre of galaxy clusters with strong cooling flows @xcite .",
    "the mere presence of w - r stars in these objects indicates recent ( @xmath4 myr ) star formation and the existence of massive stars ( @xmath5 , cf .",
    "maeder & conti , 1994 ) ; this provides already interesting information about star formation in these objects .",
    "quantitative analysis of the  emission or the w - r bump show that star formation must have occurred over short timescales compared to the lifetime of massive stars @xcite , and have allowed to derive the absolute number of w - r stars present in these regions ( @xmath6 , e.g.  vacca & conti 1992 , hereafter vc92 ) .",
    "this blue w - r bump is often blended with nearby nebular emission lines of he , fe , or ar , and can show several broad stellar emission components ( , , ) difficult to separate in most low or medium - resolution spectra .",
    "their origin can a priori be due to w - r stars of wn and/or wc subtypes , which has been a question of some earlier dispute ( cf .",
    "osterbrock & cohen , 1982 ; sargent & filippenko , 1991 ; with kunth & schild , 1986 ; conti , 1991 ) .    the strongest emission line of wc stars is  which is very weak in wn stars .",
    "this `` red w - r bump '' has quite rarely been observed so far .",
    "although conti @xcite claimed the absence of convincing evidence for carbon features in w - r galaxies ( cf .",
    "also kunth & schild , 1986 ) there is no doubt about their existence anymore ( e.g.  ngc 4861 : dinerstein & shields , 1986 ; ngc 4214 : sargent & fillipenko , 1991 , kobulniky & skillman , 1996 ; ngc 2363 : gonzalez - delgado , 1994 ; mrk 996 : thuan , izotov & lipovetsky , 1996 ; mrk 475 , mrk 1450 : izotov , 1994 ; ngc 7714 : garcia - vargas , 1997 ; i zw 18 : izotov , 1997 , legrand , 1997b ) . where the data is available ,  is generally weaker than . in our recent compilation",
    "@xcite we find @xmath2 15 objects with a fairly well established detection of broad .",
    "the presence of wc stars , although possibly less numerous than wn stars , is indeed expected both from observations of w - r populations in the local group ( e.g.  massey & johnson , 1998 ) and from stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "the predictions are that , depending on the evolutionary model and metallicity , @xmath7 % of young starburst should show an important wc population ( meynet , 1995 ; schaerer & vacca , 1998 ; hereafter sv98 ) .",
    "most surprisingly the homogenenuous , fairly high signal - to - noise spectra from the sample of vc92 containing 12 regions with  detections ( and 10 upper limits ) revealed only one  detection ( in he 2 - 10 a ) .",
    "if true , this would certainly contradict the predictions from synthesis models ( meynet , 1995 ; sv98 ) using high mass loss stellar evolution models , which otherwise compare well to observations in the local group @xcite .    to verify if this apparent discrepancy really holds we have initiated a search for wc stars in well - known w - r galaxies .",
    "we observed five objects ( ngc  3049 , he 2 - 10 , ngc  3125 , ngc  5253 , tol  89 ) , three of them are in common with vc92 .",
    "a first account of our observations of ngc  5253 was given in schaerer @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we report the successful discovery of both wn and wc stars in all of the objects , which supports our initial hypothesis of an observational bias ( i.e.  a too low signal - to - noise ratio around 5800  ) against their detection in the vc92 sample , and ( at least partly ) relieves the aforementioned discrepancy .",
    "we then use both the wn and wc signatures to constrain the burst properties and stellar evolution models .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the observations and reductions are described in sect .  2 .",
    "a spatial analysis of the emission lines is shown in sect .",
    "we describe the properties of the w - r regions and their massive star content in sect .  4 .",
    "constraints on the evolutionary tracks and the properties of the starburst regions ( age , burst duration , imf ) are derived in sect .  5 from a comparison with evolutionary synthesis models .",

    "spectra of he - ar calibration lamp were obtained immediately before and after the galaxy integrations in order to accurately calibrate the wavelength scale .",
    "the slit was oriented in order to cover regions with previous detections of w - r stars and others bright optical regions in galaxies .",
    "the slit width was 1.6  for the galaxy observations and 5   for the standard stars .",
    "the total integration time for each galaxy is given in table  [ global ] .",
    "we took multiple exposures of 1200 s in duration , short enough to avoid saturation of the bright nebular lines (   and ) and to recognize cosmic ray impacts .",
    "the seeing was relatively stable during the observations with a mean spatial resolution of about 1 , as measured by the la silla seeing monitor .",
    "the spectra were acquired at low airmass ( @xmath20 1.1 , except for ngc  3049 observed with an airmass @xmath2 1.3 ) and no correction for the loss of blue light due to atmospheric dispersion was made .",
    "the spectra were reduced according to standard reduction procedures using the midas package long .",
    "a bias level was subtracted from each frame using the overscan region of the ccd chip .",
    "a combination of flat field images from the twilight sky and a continuum quartz lamp were divided into each frame to correct for pixel to pixel variations along spatial and dispersion axes respectively .",
    "after wavelength calibration , transformation to equal wavelength intervals along the dispersion axis and flux calibration using standard stars observations , spectra from the same galaxy were combined to average frames and reject cosmic ray events .",
    "care was taken to discriminate between cosmic rays and the high peaks of strong emission lines which might also be confused with cosmic ray events . tracking with",
    "the autoguider was sufficiently good that no shifting or registration of the frames was required prior to the combine procedure .",
    "emission - lines from the night sky were then subtracted using a linear fit to at least 50 `` sky '' pixels on either side of the galaxy .",
    "we first use our long - slit spectroscopic observations to compare , for each galaxy , the spatial distributions of nebular and w - r emission - line intensities and the stellar continuum emission . for this purpose , we extracted one - dimensional spectra along the slit by adding 3 pixels to match the seeing of our observations ( @xmath2 1 ) .",
    "we choose one pixel of overlap between two adjacent spectra to maximize signal - to - noise ratio while still maintaining a good spatial resolution .",
    "depending on the spatial extent we performed between 80 and 180 extractions per galaxy , such that the brightest emission - lines (  and ) were strong enough to be measured with reliability .",
    "we then measured , for each individual spectrum , the parameters ( central wavelength , fwhm , flux and equivalent width ) of the brightest nebular emission lines ( , , , ,  and ) , the broad emission lines due to w - r stars ( blue w - r bump : blend of  and , ; red w - r bump : ) together with the continuum flux under each emission line .",

    "we show a velocity curve derived from the measured central wavelength of nebular emission lines along the slit . the mean radial heliocentric velocity has been derived using the brightest nebular lines , i.e. , ,  and , since no systematic variation in the velocity curves has been observed for the various emission lines .",
    "one of the most striking features which appear in figs .",
    "[ he0210_spat ] and [ tol89_spat ] is the difference between the distributions of stellar continuum and nebular lines in he  2 - 10 and tol  89 .",
    "the stellar continuum shows only one maximum whereas the distribution of nebular lines intensity is mostly double - peaked . moreover , the maximum intensity of nebular lines is shifted relative to the maximum intensity of stellar continuum , both for he  2 - 10 ( @xmath2 1  to the east ) and tol  89 ( @xmath2 2  to the south - west ) . in the other galaxies ,",

    "these results confirm the stellar origin of the broad w - r emission lines .",
    "given the good signal - to - noise ratio of our observations , it has been possible to detect the w - r lines over a large extension around the maximum intensity .",
    "the size of the `` w - r regions '' ranges from 2  ",

    "three starburst regions can be distinguished on the optical images of he  2 - 10 @xcite .",

    "regions a , b , and c are resolved into several knots on _ hst _ uv images @xcite .",
    "the presence of three starburst regions in the central part of he  2 - 10 is consistent with the spatial distribution of w - r emission lines along the slit ( @xmath2 4  long ) which shows a maximum in @xmath22 but extends also to the region @xmath24 , the secondary peak of nebular emission seen in fig.[he0210_spat ] .",
    "knot @xmath23 was not included in our slit .",
    "our long - slit spectrum of he  2 - 10 shows w - r features in regions a and c. however , the spectral signatures in region @xmath24 are too faint to be considered separately from region @xmath22 in the following analysis ( see sect .  [ w - rregions ] ) .      in ngc  3049 and ngc  3125 ,",
    "the w - r regions coincide with the peaks of the continuum emission and nebular lines distributions .",
    "ngc  3049 is a barred spiral galaxy belonging to the virgo cluster .",
    "this low - mass galaxy has a small bulge and a thin bar of constant surface brightness surrounded by an inner ring @xcite .",
    "the optical appearance of ngc  3125 is an amorphous elliptical shape with a bright central starburst region dominated by two bright knots ( regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) apparently connected by a bridge of fainter intensity .",
    "our observations of ngc  5253 have already been presented in schaerer et al .",
    "the spatial distribution of w - r stars in this object is complex ( see fig .",
    "[ n5253_spat ] ) .",
    "there are two w - r regions , labeled as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , located at the two peaks intensity of the continuum and nebular lines distributions .",
    "the brightest w - r region ( @xmath23 ) , however , corresponds to the faintest continuum and emission lines region . for this galaxy we made a distinction between the distribution of the  and  lines .",
    "there is indeed a third bright ``  region '' ( region @xmath25 in schaerer , 1997 ) located 6  north - east of the brightest w - r region @xmath23 .",
    "the spectrum of this region show a narrower  line than in others regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , probably of nebular origin @xcite .",
    "in fact , the core of the galaxy ( @xmath2 20  of diameter ) host a dozen blue stellar clusters as well as diffusely distributed massive stars ( meurer  1995 ; cf .  also calzetti , 1997 for a recent study of ngc  5253 ) .",
    "tol  89 is a giant  region located in one of the spiral arms of the barred spiral galaxy ngc  5398 , about 34  south - west of the nucleus .",
    "this object shows the largest shift between the spatial distribution of the continuum and nebular lines .",
    "the spatial distribution of the w - r lines is narrower than that of the nebular lines .",
    "w - r lines are found at the two regions where the continuum peaks .",
    "in this section , we present a spectroscopic analysis of the individual regions where spectral signatures from w - r stars have been detected .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted corresponding to the different regions by adding several columns along the slit .",
    "the size of the extraction window has been chosen for each region in order to obtain the best compromise between a high signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum ( around 4700   and 5800  ) and a good enough spatial resolution .",
    "we extracted one - dimensional spectra centered on the maximum intensity of w - r emission lines with an aperture of @xmath2 1.7   for ngc  5253 ( regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and tol  89 , @xmath2 2.0  for ngc  3049 , @xmath2 2.7  for he  2 - 10 and ngc  3125 ( regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "we thus obtained spectra for a total of seven regions , one per galaxy except for ngc  3125 and ngc  5253 in which two w - r regions have been identified . the full wavelength range ( @xmath26  , corrected for the doppler effect ) of the flux calibrated spectra ( not corrected for reddening ) of w - r regions are shown in fig .  [ specall ] .",
    "normalized spectra showing the region around the blue and red w - r bumps are given in figs .",
    "[ spec4700 ] and [ spec5800 ] respectively .",
    "given the complex structure and multiple blends around the blue w - r bump and the medium resolution of our spectra we adopt the following procedure to measure accurately the individual emission lines .",
    "we use a procedure of multi - gaussians fitting where the number of gaussians is the only fixed parameter ( central wavelength , intensity and fwhm are free to vary ) .",
    "the normalized spectra were obtained by dividing the spectra by a low - order polynomial fit on the line - free region of the continuum . in table",
    "[ data ] we report the measurements performed on the normalized spectra .",
    "the uncertainties are discussed next .",
    "there are three major sources of uncertainties in the measured fluxes and equivalent widths of emission lines .",
    "the first one is inherent to the measurement itself and depends mainly on the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra .",
    "these errors were computed directly when using the iraf task splot to derive the parameters of emission lines .",
    "the second source of errors comes from the extraction of an individual spectrum corresponding to a region in a galaxy . indeed , for some galaxies",
    "like he  2 - 10 and tol  89 , we observe a shift between the maximum emission of the stellar continuum and of the nebular lines ( see sect .  [ spatanal ] ) .",
    "thus , the measured line flux and equivalent width of the lines is sensitive to the size of the extraction window used to obtain one - dimensional spectra of the individual regions . to estimate this error",
    ", we measured the lines in extracted spectra from effective apertures sizes ranging from 1  to 4 . a third source of uncertainty exists for lines from the blue w - r bump .",
    "given the important slope of spectra and the complex structure in this region the line measurement also depends on the determination of the continuum level ( i.e.  the normalization ) .",
    "therefore measurements of emission lines in the w - r bumps were performed before and after normalization .",
    "the three sources of errors were propagated quadratically to obtain the final uncertainties reported in table  [ data ] for the dereddened line fluxes and for the equivalent widths . for the bright nebular emission lines ( like ,  and ) ,",
    "the relative uncertainty is generally smaller than 10% .",
    "however , it can reach a maximum of @xmath2 20% for the equivalent width and of @xmath2 30% for the relative flux of faintest broad emission lines from w - r stars .",
    "we find that generally errors due to the measurement itself ( which is @xmath27 s / n ) and to the extraction window are comparable",
    ". for emission lines from the blue w - r bump , the uncertainties due to the normalization are not negligible and can even be comparable in some cases .",
    "we note however some exceptions . for he  2 - 10 and tol  89 , which show a discrepancy between the nebular and the continuum emission , the uncertainty on the equivalent width of nebular lines ( and especially for ) is dominated by the error due to the size of the extraction window .",
    "we checked the absolute flux calibration (  flux ) , the relative line flux of ,  and  lines , and the equivalent width of   by comparing our measurements with previous observations reported in the literature : he  2 - 10 @xcite , ngc  3049 @xcite , ngc 3125 @xcite , ngc  5253 @xcite , and tol  89 @xcite .",
    "a good agreement was generally found for the absolute calibration and the relative fluxes of bright nebular lines , with relative errors @xmath28 20% .",
    "larger differences can be found for the broad w - r lines .",
    "comparing our data with vc92 , our measurements of   ( relative flux to  and equivalent width ) are found to be systematically larger by a factor of @xmath2 3 in ngc  3049 , and @xmath2 1.5 in he  2 - 10 and ngc  3125 , although a good agreement is found for the nebular lines .",
    "given the systematic differences , it is unlikely that different slit positions are responsible for this effect .",
    "to understand the origin of this discrepancy , we compared our spectra to those published in vc92 and kindly provided by william vacca .",
    "the comparison shows that the differences can mostly be understood in terms of differing signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "indeed , the measurement of the faint , broad w - r emission lines is strongly dependent on the signal - to - noise ratio , especially to fit the continuum level in the deblending process used to separate the w - r bump into the individual components . given the improved quality of our spectra ( s /",
    "n @xmath2 5070 around 4700 compared to s / n @xmath29 for vc92 ) , our measurements should be more reliable .",
    "in particular the improved s",
    "/ n also allows the detection of the weaker +  blend , barely detectable in the data of vc92 .    within the uncertainties , our new measurements of w - r emission lines in ngc  5253 are consistent with those given in schaerer  @xcite , which were obtained from a different reduction / analysis .      due to the limited spectral range",
    ", our observations do not include the  emission line commonly used to determine the internal reddening parameter .",
    "we therefore adopt values taken from the recent literature .",
    "we wish to remind that the determination of the amount of reddening is subject to two complications often not accounted for : 1 ) the value of the extinction coefficient can be wavelength dependent , and 2 ) variations of the extinction on small spatial scales can occur .",
    "the former is well illustrated by the case of he  2 - 10 , where  varies from @xmath2 0.4 in the optical @xcite to @xmath2 4.5 in the infrared @xcite and can even reach @xmath2 14 in the millimeter range @xcite .",
    "ngc  5253 is a good example showing large spatial variations of reddening @xcite .",
    "the adopted extinction coefficient is taken from regions corresponding as closely as possible to the ones studied here and derived from optical spectra , i.e.  from the balmer decrement .",
    "our adopted reddening values are given in table  [ data ] .",
    "for he  2 - 10 and ngc  3125 , we adopt the internal extinction coefficients given by vc92 , with different values for regions @xmath22 (  @xmath2 0.40 ) and @xmath23 (  @xmath2 0.64 ) of ngc  3125 . for ngc  3049",

    "our w - r region is indeed better identified in the spectroscopic observations of contini  @xcite .",

    "we adopt @xmath92  @xcite , and for @xmath89 , we use the estimated age of the starburst listed in table  [ starpop ] ( column 2 ) . the computed radius @xmath50 and expansion velocity @xmath51 of the bubble",
    "are given in the last two columns of table  [ starpop ] .",
    "comparing these values to the velocity differences observed in the w - r regions of galaxies ( from @xmath2 40 to 100 ) , we find that the observed and predicted bubble expansion speeds are in satisfactory agreement , especially when considering the extreme simplicity of the model and the observational uncertainties .",
    "the comparison of radius is more doubtful since , with long - slit spectra , we have some informations in only one spatial direction . the rough assessments of `` bubble '' radius from velocity curves are systematically lower by a factor two ( ngc 3049 ) to six ( he  2 - 10 ) than the values predicted by the model .",
    "the same trend has been observed using  images of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are certainly due to the difficulty to measure a `` radius '' from the velocity curves and to the simplicity of the model which assumes a pure spherical bubble expanding adiabatically .",
    "when looking deeply in  images of nearby galaxies , like ngc  5253 @xcite , one can see that the structure of expanding gas is much more chaotic , ranging from large scale ( @xmath2 1 kpc ) filaments to roughly circular shell nebulae of smaller size ( @xmath21 100 pc ) .",
    "it is thus very difficult and even meaningless to compare some predicted and observed bubble `` radius '' .    nevertheless , the size ( @xmath2 50 to 300 pc ) of expanding gas structures observed in w - r regions is significantly smaller than those derived from   images ( @xmath2 700 to 1500 pc ) of dwarf galaxies @xcite",
    ". this might reflect the different time scales of the gas dynamics , which depend on the age of the starburst responsible for the release of kinematical energy through stellar winds and supernovae explosions . in the w - r regions ,",
    "the starburst is one order of magnitude younger ( a few @xmath93 yr ) than the one ( a few @xmath94 yr ) derived from gas kinematics in older starburst regions @xcite .",
    "this could explain the smaller sizes of expanding `` bubbles '' in w - r regions .",
    "an additional effect may be the smaller energy injection expected from young regions where the sn rate is still small .",
    "in any case it is evident that the large population of massive stars derived in w - r regions strongly perturb the surrounding ism through the injection of their mechanical energy .",
    "all the observed w - r features and the most important nebular h and he lines have been modeled recently with synthesis models by sv98 .",
    "the aim of this section is to constrain the main burst parameters ( age , imf , star formation history ) as far as possible from the observed w - r signatures .",
    "finally the success or failure to reproduce the observed features also provides a test of the underlying evolutionary tracks .      in the following we consider two basic free model parameters : the imf slope and the duration of the star - forming event .",
    "the third model parameter , the metallicity @xmath83 , is adopted from the observations ( see values given below ) . a power law with a slope @xmath12 is adopted for the imf ( in our notation @xmath95 for a salpeter imf ) .",
    "the upper mass cut - off is generally set to @xmath96 120 ; the results discussed in this work are not affected by the choice of the lower mass cut - off .",
    "we consider burst models with different durations @xmath97 starting at time @xmath98 , with the limiting case of an instantaneous burst ( @xmath99 ) .    for the subsequent detailed comparison it is , however , useful to remind some assumptions or uncertainties of the models , which are not considered as proper free parameters .",
    "* most important is the set of stellar evolution models adopted .",
    "we use sv98 models based on the latest geneva stellar evolution tracks ( high mass loss models of meynet , 1994 ) , which have been extensively compared to observations ( see maeder & meynet 1994 ) and which in particular reproduce well massive star populations in the local group . only single star models are considered ( but see sect .  5.3 for binary stars ) . * the predicted fraction of wc stars ( wc / wr , and wc / wn ) is affected by the choice of interpolation techniques as briefly discussed in sect .  4.5 and sv98 . during the wr phase at ages",
    "@xmath100 4 myr the relative wc populations predicted by the meynet ( 1995 ) and sv98 models differ ; compared to the models used here ( sv98 ) , more wc stars are likely to exist at @xmath100 4 myr . * as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ masspop ] the predicted strength of the w - r lines is affected by the uncertainty of the intrinsic w - r line luminosity , which is the largest for . * to relate models with observations @xmath73 is conveniently used as an age indicator .",
    "this assumes that the models predict the correct number of ionizing photons ( i.e.  correct atmospheres , tracks ) , case b ( ionization bounded nebula ) is valid and the fraction of photons absorbed by the gas is correct ( sv98 adopt @xmath101 ) , and the continuum light is correctly predicted .",
    "all except the last point determine obviously the correctness of the nebular line intensity , whose strength is also used for comparisons with the wr lines ( see below ) .",
    "it is fairly difficult to verify how well the predicted @xmath73age relation ( cf .  copetti 1986 ) holds .",
    "empirical tests using recent models and observations of  regions and their stellar content in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds could be useful . the fact that very few  regions with observed @xmath73 as large as predicted by synthesis models for ages @xmath2 02 myr may indicate a difficulty in the @xmath73age relation ( e.g.  mas - hesse & kunth 1998 ) .    the comparison with the observations can be performed in two ways .",
    "one may compare relative line intensities of the w - r features with respect to the nebular  emission ( in short w - r/ ) , or use equivalent widths of the w - r lines .",
    "observationaly the determination of these quantities can mainly be `` perturbed '' by three effects :    * we do not count all the ionizing photons produced by massive stars .",
    "this may happen if the nebular emission from the  region of interest is not entirely included in the slit ( e.g. if the gaseous component is more extended than the ionizing star clusters ) , and/or if ionizing photons can escape from the  region ( i.e.  not ionization bounded nebula ) .",
    "* stars and gas suffer from a different extinction . *",
    "an underlying older population contributes additional continuum light .",
    "the relative intensities w - r/  are effected only by _ ( i ) _ and _ ( ii)_. effect _ ( i ) _ increase the relative wr/  intensities .",
    "the same holds for _ ( ii ) _ if the stellar light is less extincted than the gas ( cf .",

    "the equivalent widths are only affected by _ ( iii ) _ , which decreases the observed value . for the present paper the _ quantitative _ importance of these effects",
    "can not be asserted in general without additional observations . at least our spatial information ( see sect .",
    "[ w - rdistri ] ) can provide hints on _",
    "( i)_. from the work of mas - hesse & kunth ( 1998 ) we see that , if present , the differences in extinction between the gas and stars are typically @xmath102 0.05  0.1 .",
    "this implies that the stellar flux may be overestimated by a factor of @xmath2 1.2  1.4 , i.e.  @xmath103 , @xmath44 and hence @xmath104o have to be reduced by the same amount .",
    "although e.g.  the wc / wn ratio is in principle also modified , the effect is small ( @xmath2 4  8 % ) . for ngc  3125 ,",
    "ngc  5253 , and ngc  3049 an underlying population contributes to @xmath2 60 % of the light at 4630   ( mas - hesse 1998 , private communication ) , which would correspond to a downward correction by a factor of @xmath2 1.7 for e.g.  @xmath105 . in our observations",
    "the contribution from an underlying population is , however , most certainly smaller since they are taken with smaller apertures including the bulk of the young emission line regions ( cf .  also schaerer 1997 ) but only a smaller fraction of the continuum light .    given these potential difficulties both comparisons of relative line intensities w - r/  and w - r equivalent widths will be performed for all objects .",
    "significant differences between the two methods likely indicate some difficulty with _ ( d ) _ and/or effects _ ( i)(iii)_. in this case the simplest meaningful comparison is between the observed wr equivalent widths and the maximum value predicted by the models ( irrespectively of the age ) ; it only depends on _",
    "( iii)_.    it is well known that the w - r populations strongly depend on metallicity .",
    "we will therefore compare the observed regions to the models at the closest metallicity available .",

    "the following general comments can be made to figs .",
    "[ fig_ihb ] and [ fig_ew ] .    from object to object the observed line ratios vary by a much larger factor than the w - r equivalent widths .",
    "this can be explained by the more rapid decrease of the lyman continuum luminosity ( i.e.  the  intensity ) compared to the smaller variations in the optical continuum light in a short burst . with the exception of  in tol 89 ( cf .",
    "below ) , larger line ratios are found in objects with higher @xmath83 .",
    "this is to first order understood by the more rapid decline of the ionizing luminosity with increasing metallicity , whereas the increase of the w - r population is less important ( sv98 ) .",
    "these findings favor the picture of short burst periods ( compared to the lifetime of massive stars ) and support the predicted dependence of the ionizing population with metallicity found independently from other studies @xcite .",
    "w - r signatures are observed at  equivalent widths where the models indeed predict w - r stars .",

    "some difference seems , however , to be present for the appearance of wc signatures ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_ew_004 ] ) . given the uncertainty _",
    "( b ) _ in the models , this difference is not significant ( see below ) .    comparing the individual objects ( classified by metallicity ) with the model predictions , we find the following :      the predictions of the standard model ( instantaneous burst , salpeter imf ) for the high metallicity region in ngc 3049 show an excellent agreement with all observed w - r line strengths .",
    "this is also the case for the  feature ( not shown here ) which is only detected in ngc 3049 .      for he 2 - 10",
    "the comparison between the equivalent widths and the line ratios shows a somewhat different picture . while the observed equivalent widths are considerably smaller than the maximum value predicted by the models ( for the corresponding @xmath109 ) , the relative line intensities are close to the predicted maximum .",

    "the mere detection of w - r signatures in the integrated spectrum of galaxies reveals the presence of stars with ages generally between 1 and 8 myr ( meynet , 1995 ; sv98 ) , depending on the metallicity .",
    "these predictions , based on single star evolutionary models , apply for stars which have undergone `` normal '' mass loss .",
    "the possibility of additional mass loss through roche - lobe overflow in a close binary system is not considered here @xcite .",

    "this quantitative estimate is compatible with most studies of w - r galaxies which have so far clearly favoured instantaneous burst scenarios @xcite .",
    "what can be said about the imf slope ? as mentioned earlier the observations of the w - r features in ngc  3049 , he  2 - 10 , and ngc  5253 are quite compatible with a salpeter imf .",
    "however , the large observed values of @xmath105 in ngc  3125-a and tol 89 , and @xmath120 in tol 89 ( representing in principle already lower limits due to _ ( iii ) _ ) may require more w - r stars .",
    "this can be obtained by invoking a flatter imf , which increases the wr equivalent widths as shown in fig .",

    "more imf - sensitive are the features of wc stars , which descend on the average from more massive predecessors than wn stars and from a narrower range of initial masses .",
    "although the standard models show some deficiencies it is difficult to claim significant differences with respect to a salpeter imf for the following reasons : 1 ) the  predictions are not very sensitive to the imf slope .",
    "furthermore the prediction of this line is uncertain ( see _ ( c ) _ , and the observed line may also be contaminated by nebular emission ( e.g.  in ngc  3125-a , sect .  [ masspop ] ) .",
    "2 ) most of the wc signatures from the discrepant objects are within the range of the model predictions for a salpeter imf .",
    "we therefore conclude that within the uncertainties our observations are compatible with a salpeter imf .",

    "the high mass loss models of meynet @xcite are clearly favoured from our comparison ( see also maeder & meynet , 1994 ) .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained from comparisons of new evolutionary tracks with the observed w - r population in the extremely metal - poor galaxy i zw 18 @xcite , showing the usefulness of such observations to constrain evolutionary scenarios in environments ( i.e.  extreme metallicities ) inaccessible in the local group .",
    "our successful finding of wc stars in w - r galaxies opens the door to new systematic studies of massive star populations in starbursts .",
    "in addition to the subjects addressed in the present paper the study of wc stars in starburst regions is of interest for several other reasons : _ 1 ) _ wc stars may contribute to a harder ionizing spectrum which has implications on the observed nebular properties ( e.g.  terlevich & melnick 1985 , schaerer 1996 ) . _ 2 ) _ regions which harbour wc stars during their lifetimes are expected to produce ejecta of significantly different composition ( cf .",

    "<S> we report the detection of wc stars in five wolf - rayet ( w - r ) galaxies : he 2 - 10 , ngc 3049 , ngc 3125 , ngc 5253 and tol 89 . </S>",
    "<S> the faint broad  line requires sufficiently high s / n ( @xmath0 40 ) to be detected explaining the non - detection of this wc feature in previous observations . from the measurement of w - r emission lines ( + , , and ) </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that all w - r regions contain a mixed population of wnl , and early wc stars . </S>",
    "<S> the exception is the high - metallicity region ngc  3049 where late wc stars prevail .    a spatial offset between the multiple peaks of the nebular emission and the stellar light in he 2 - 10 and tol 89 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> these nebular emission structures are likely due to the existence of bubbles and loops , owing to the injection of mechanical energy in the ism through the w - r winds and/or supernovae . due to age differences and likely smaller energy deposition </S>",
    "<S> the structures around the w - r regions are possibly smaller than the ones predominantly energized by sne . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of w - r stars closely follows the stellar continuum with no significant distinction between wn and wc stars .    from the luminosity of the w - r signatures </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the absolute number of w - r stars of the different subtypes . </S>",
    "<S> the wc / wn number ratios have typical values between 0.2  0.4 , and show no clear trend with metallicity . for low - metallicity objects ( @xmath1 ) , these values are larger than the observed wc / wn ratios in local group objects , but are compatible with expectations for star forming events with short duration if stellar evolution models with high mass loss are used .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive ages for the starburst regions in the range of 3 to 6 myr and confirm that the burst duration must not exceed @xmath2 24 myr to account for the high population of w - r stars observed in starburst regions , even if emission line stars similar to those observed in r136 and ngc  3603 are common in starbursts . within the uncertainties </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the observed quantities is reasonably reproduced by models with a salpeter imf . </S>",
    "<S> although some w - r lines in few regions are stronger than predicted by the models no clear case requiring a significantly flatter imf is found . </S>",
    "<S> imf slopes much steeper than salpeter may , however , not be compatible with our data . </S>"
