    "two recent experiments , cast@xcite and pvlas@xcite searching for an ultralight axion - like pseudoscalar particle ( denoted by @xmath0 ) with coupling of the form @xmath1 have given apparently contradictory results .",
    "the cast@xcite experiment looked for @xmath0-particles from the sun produced in the reaction @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the plasmon in the solar plasma and @xmath4 is a real photon .",
    "it found that in a wide mass range that includes the milli - electron - volt ( mev ) mass , there was no signal for @xmath0 giving an upper limit on its two photon coupling that implies @xmath5 gev . on the other hand in a laboratory experiment , known as pvlas@xcite a birefringence effect where the plane of polarization of a photon beam incident on a static magnetic field is rotated ,",
    "was observed .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of this appears to be in terms of the production of a pseudo - scalar axion like particle with mass between 1.7 - 2 mev with the corresponding coupling scale in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath6 gev . in the context of simple axion models@xcite , there appears to be no way to reconcile these two results@xcite and several alternative mechanisms involving new particles have been suggested@xcite to resolve this puzzle .",
    "this experimental observation has also stimulated a great deal of discussion on possible new properties and tests for such particles@xcite , new ways to search for them@xcite as well as their astrophysical implications@xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this brief note to present a new model where the sub - gev scale effective lagrangian consists of two light scalars fields @xmath7 and a light pseudoscalar @xmath0 ( @xmath0 being the mev particle of interest ) and a modified form for the @xmath0-photon ( @xmath8 ) interaction . with this , we seem to be able to reconcile these two experimental results provided we assume the existence of a low temperature phase transition .",
    "recall that the main challenge of the axion like interpretation of the above experiments is to prevent the axion production in the sun in @xmath9 collision without affecting the same in the laboratory .",
    "our basic idea is to avoid this problem by introducing an interaction of the form @xmath10 rather than a direct @xmath11 interaction and assuming the field @xmath12 to have the following properties : ( i ) it has a non - zero vev , which is induced by a field @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 kev where @xmath16 is a function of the parameters of the model which we will show later to be of order @xmath17 giving @xmath18 gev ; ( ii ) the field @xmath12 has a mass of order of 20 - 50 mev .",
    "it then follows that in environments having temperature below a kev as in the laboratory , we have the effective interaction @xmath19 ( since @xmath20 gives @xmath21 ) with an effective coupling @xmath22 whereas in hot environments @xmath23 kev , as in the core of the sun , we have @xmath24 giving @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that the effective interaction inside the sun has the form @xmath26 type only and not @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath12 mass is far above the solar temperature , this avoids not only @xmath0 production via the process @xmath28 but also the process @xmath29 . as we will see below , if @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 mev , the model is consistent with cosmological , astrophysical as well as laboratory observations , providing a viable way to reconcile the pvlas and cast observations .",
    "we also advance a preliminary speculation on the possible origin of the effective interaction in terms of new physics .",
    "our model consists of the neutral spin zero fields , three real scalars @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath32 and one real pseudo - scalar @xmath0 , which are singlets under the sm gauge group and have the effective interaction lagrangian below gev scale given by @xmath33 we have displayed only those terms in the lagrangian which are relevant to our discussion and omitted others .",
    "we assume all parameters to be positive and couplings to be of order one and take as a working example , the masses @xmath34 gev , @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 gev , @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 kev . at zero temperature",
    ", this lagrangian has the property that @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 kev .",
    "we see from the lagrangian that when @xmath20 it induces a vev of @xmath12 of order @xmath41 we assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we find that for @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 gev .",
    "when the system is in an environment where @xmath47 , we have phase transition which gives @xmath48 and hence @xmath49 .    in this framework",
    ", we can easily see how to reconcile the pvlas and cast results . in the laboratory , @xmath50",
    "and we have @xmath51 gev giving @xmath52 coupling with @xmath53 gev which explains the pvlas result . when temperature of an environment @xmath54 kev as in the core of the sun , there is phase transition in the @xmath13 field and we get @xmath55 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath56 .",
    "thus in the sun , @xmath57 ( since @xmath58 ) and as a result there is no direct axion - two - photon interaction .",
    "there is of course @xmath59 interaction ; but since @xmath35 mev or so , @xmath60 interaction can produce the @xmath61 final state only from the `` tail '' of the thermodynamic distribution of the photons .",
    "the cross section is then proportional to @xmath62 gev@xmath63 which is negligible and obviously well below the present cast bound for the @xmath0 production rate .",
    "this provides a reconciliation between the cast and pvlas results .",
    ", width=192,height=192 ]",
    "before considering the phenomenological implications of this effective lagrangian model , let us make sure that the theory after symmetry breaking is consistent i.e. all scalar fields have positive @xmath64 . to check this ,",
    "let us write down the scalar field mass matrix for the @xmath65 system in the basis @xmath66 after shifting the fields by their vevs .",
    "we assume that there is a fine tuning between the two entries in the @xmath68 element of the mass matrix in such a way that the eigenvalues of this mass matrix are positive .",
    "for this to happen , we must assume that @xmath69 .",
    "this is the same assumption for the parameters that we used earlier .",
    "\\(i ) first point to note is that our interaction leads to light by light scattering @xmath70 with a strength @xmath71 arising from a one loop diagram involving the @xmath72 intermediate state in the loop ( see fig .",
    "this is much smaller than the electron contribution to this process which goes like @xmath73 by a factor @xmath74 .",
    "the contribution of this to @xmath75 of muon and electrons depends on the ultraviolet behavior of the theory .",
    "if we assume that above a @xmath76 gev , the theory is strongly damped by form factors giving effectively @xmath77 gev as the cutoff then its contribution to @xmath78 of muons and electrons is safely consistent with the present experiments .",
    "\\(ii ) in the presence of this interaction , there will be new contribution to @xmath79 annihilation of type @xmath80 as displayed in figure @xmath81 . since @xmath12 has a decay width of approximately @xmath82 gev ( or lifetime of about @xmath83 sec . )",
    ", it will decay within a detector to 2 photons plus an @xmath0 particle .",
    "thus the signal will look like @xmath84 . for @xmath85,the cross section for this process",
    "is @xmath86 which for @xmath87 gev is of order @xmath88 pico barns which is smaller than the predicted standard model background process @xmath89 by one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "( iii)the new interaction could also lead to the quarkonium ( such as @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) decay @xmath92 since we have @xmath93 . in our model ,",
    "the branching ratio for the radiative decay of @xmath94 into axion and @xmath12 is @xmath95 this is about two order of magnitude below the experimental limit @xmath96 and is safely consistent with our assumptions .",
    "\\(iv ) second point to note is that this four particle interaction also does not lead to new channels for rapid energy loss from the supernova .",
    "this is because the @xmath97 scattering has a strength of order @xmath98 gev@xmath63 which is of the same order as the fermi constant @xmath99 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath0 and the @xmath12 particles produced in the @xmath100 collision will get trapped in the supernova core and will therefore contribute to the energy loss from supernova by approximately the same amount as a single neutrino species .",
    "this possibility is not ruled out by the sn1987a observations , which has considerable uncertainty as to how much total energy is emitted in neutrinos compared to the total energy generated in supernova core collapse .",
    "\\(v ) to see if this new interaction affects considerations of big bang nucleosynthesis , we note that above @xmath101 gev in the early universe , the @xmath12 and @xmath0 were in thermal equilibrium with the rest of the primordial plasma .",
    "as the universe cools below @xmath102 , the @xmath12 particle decays since its decay rate is bigger than the hubble expansion rate at @xmath103 .",
    "thus at the bbn epoch , in addition to the standard model particles the only two new particles in equilibrium are @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "together they contribute @xmath104 .",
    "this appears to be consistent with latest bbn results@xcite .",
    "\\(vi ) finally , we advance a preliminary speculation on the possible origin of the higher dimensional @xmath26 interaction .",
    "consider extending the standard model by adding a vector like pair of fermions @xmath105 which are leptonic and have electric charge @xmath106 ( or equivalently @xmath107 and @xmath108 100 gev .",
    "let there be a neutral pseudo - scalar particle @xmath109 with mass @xmath110 few gev with an interaction of the form @xmath111 in this model the familiar triangle diagram will induce an effective @xmath112 interaction with approximate strength @xmath113 .",
    "the tree level exchange of @xmath109 will then generate an effective lagrangian below the gev scale of the form we have been discussing .",
    "the parameters of the theory can be so chosen as to give @xmath114 gev ( e.g @xmath115 gev ) .",
    "this would provide a renormalizable version of our model . of course one could perhaps interpret @xmath109 as an axion corresponding to a different strongly interacting theory ( technicolor ? ) .",
    "further discussion of this model as well as its detailed implications is postponed to a future publication .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented an effective lagrangian below the gev scale which seems to be able to reconcile the cast and the pvlas experiments in a way that is different from other existing explanations .",
    "we find the model to be compatible with all laboratory , astrophysical as well as cosmological observations .",
    "we also advance a preliminary speculation on a possible origin of this effective lagrangian .",
    "detailed phenomenological and astrophysical implications of this model are currently under investigation .",
