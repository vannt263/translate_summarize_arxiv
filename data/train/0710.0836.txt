    "recent experimental studies of magnetic nanoarrays  @xcite revealed the giant magnetoresistance ( mr ) effect . at low temperatures",
    "the hysteresis of the magnetization was found to lead to a splitting of the resistance peak  @xcite whereas at temperatures above @xmath0k the magnetization hysteresis disappears and the mr shows a single peak at zero external magnetic field .",
    "the interest in these systems is motivated both , by the important technological promise  @xcite and by the opportunity of applying the ideas developed for granular materials for the description of doped manganite systems  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the giant mr of magnetic nanoarrays and develop a model for the field and temperature dependent magnetization hysteresis and the sample resistivity .",
    "we consider temperatures below the curie temperature of the individual grains , @xmath1 . for @xmath2",
    "the nanoarray can be either in a _",
    "( sfm ) state with the magnetic moments of the grains aligned by ferromagnetic interactions and the systems has a multidomain structure  @xcite , or , at higher temperatures , in a _ superparamagnetic _ ( spm )",
    "state , where magnetic moments of individual grains ( superspins ) are mutually disoriented by thermal fluctuations . in real systems the ferromagnetic coupling can appear due to a competition of exchange and dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the former is always present which favors ferromagnetic order , whereas the latter alone would lead to an antiferromagnetic order or a striped phase depending on the orientation of the ( super- ) spins .",
    "recently a detailed analysis of nano - granular arrays of magnetic particles revealed that short - ranged exchange interaction stabilize the superferromagnet and the ferromagentic interaction is provided by  glue particles ",
    ", which are basically remains of the sample preparation process of nearly atomic size  @xcite .",
    "the electronic transport within a single domain in the sfm state or in the spm state is controlled by the average mutual alignment of the superspins  @xcite [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq.sigma ] ) below ] .",
    "in addition , in the sfm state the contribution of the domain wall dynamics in an applied magnetic field and the associated change of the size of domains with different bulk magnetizations on the mr has to be taken into account .",
    "magnetoresistance in granular materials was studied theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite before . however , these considerations were classical , using a spin - dependent scattering approach with a phenomenological spin - diffusion length , which is defined as the distance a spin - polarized conduction electron travels before it undergoes a spin - flip collision , for regular arrays of monodisperse spherical grains .",
    "in contrast to these previous considerations , we take coulomb blockade effects , multiple electron co - tunneling , and domain wall dynamics into account in the present paper . moreover , our approach is applicable for arrays with position disorder , size distribution of the grains , quenched mesoscopic disorder due to impurities within the grains as well as in the embedding matrix .",
    "on top of the imperfections of the system , also annealed disorder in the form of thermal fluctuations of the magnetic moments is included .",
    "of the two domains have opposite signs .",
    "the bold wavy line shall only illustrate the model of an elastic string which represents the real domain wall . in general domain walls",
    "are several grains thick where the average orientation of the superspins changes gradually from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the domain wall is described by an elastic object driven by the external magnetic field @xmath5 moving in the @xmath6-direction . ]",
    "we consider two- and three - dimensional arrays of conducting magnetic nano - size granules , weakly coupled via tunnel junctions .",
    "granularity gives rise to coulomb blockade effects , controlling the low temperature conductivity at @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the charging energy of a single granule , with @xmath9 being the electron charge , @xmath10 is the sample dielectric constant , and @xmath11 is the granule size",
    ". it can be as large as several hundred kelvins which is exactly the experimentally relevant temperature interval )  .",
    "here we discuss the experimentally important case where @xmath12 .",
    "then the conductivity of a nanogranular array composed of superspins in a _",
    "single _ super - domain in the sfm ( or in the spm ) state is given by  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the tunneling conductance of the spm state with no magnetic field , @xmath15 the polarization factor of the grains , @xmath16 the normalized bulk magnetization ( @xmath17 is the angle between the magnetic moments of adjacent superspins and @xmath18 stand for averaging over a single domain ) , and @xmath19 $ ] with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the characteristic energy scale and the inelastic localization length , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ eq.sigma ] ) describes the contribution from the co - tunneling processes governing hopping conductivity in granular materials  @xcite which holds as long as the electron hopping distance exceeds the size of a single grain , @xmath11 , i.e. as long as @xmath22 .",
    "the mr in nanogranular magnets ( see fig .  [ fig.model ] ) stems from ( i ) the field dependent bulk magnetization and ( ii ) the domain wall motion in the sfm state .",
    "normally the thickness of the domain walls is negligible as compared to the domain size itself , allowing to model their dynamics under the external magnetic field by an elastic membrane driven through a random medium  @xcite .",
    "we also exclude domain nucleation processes within a domain involved and assume that the domain walls are sufficiently spatially separated or the external magnetic field changes fast enough in order to avoid effects of domain wall interaction ( for more details , see discussion at the end of the paper ) .",
    "thus , only the change of domain sizes associated with the domain walls dynamics contribute to the electron transport but not to the electron scattering at the walls  ) the conductivity @xmath23 can decrease by about a factor of @xmath24 if @xmath25 changes from @xmath26 ( in a domain ) to @xmath27 .",
    "this is approximately the case at a domain wall ( in the worst case ) : inside the domain we can assume that @xmath28 , i.e. it has the best conductivity , and at the domain wall the average change of angles @xmath17 is at most @xmath29 if the wall contains at least one grain ( a direct jump from the domain @xmath3 to the domain @xmath4 is unphysical ) .",
    "the highest possible resistivity within the wall is therefore @xmath30 from which we can estimate the linear resistance of a singe domain wall of width @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "since we assume that the average domain size @xmath33 is much larger than @xmath31 and the linear resistance of a domain is @xmath34 it follows immediately that the contribution of the domain wall to the total system resistance can be neglected .",

    "the double peak structure in the resistivity was observed in several experiments  @xcite , with @xmath140 in the range @xmath141 to @xmath142 , which is in good agreement with our results .",
    "however , mostly the single peak in the giant magnetorestance in the spm state at high temperatures ( from @xmath143k to room temperature ) has been studied  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to compare our predictions for the magnetoresistance @xmath144 to more precise measurements at low temperatures near the sample curie temperature .",
    "there are several characteristic length scales in the present problem .",

    "the weak random forces accumulate to a value comparable to the elastic force . on smaller",
    "length scales the domain - wall is essentially flat and above the interface becomes rough .",
    "therefore the domain size @xmath33 in nanogranular magnets should be larger than @xmath148 in order to use the model for domain wall dynamics .",
    "thus , our consideration is valid for the following sequence of length scales , @xmath149 . on the other hand",
    "the relevant length scale for electron conductivity is the hopping length @xmath150 . since the energy scale @xmath151 the hopping length can not be smaller than the size of a single grain , @xmath152 . at the same time",
    "the relation between @xmath153 and @xmath154 is arbitrary .",
    "the mapping of simulation temperature and magnetic field slightly depends on the rate of change of the external driving force @xmath155 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.motion ] ) - if it is changed more slowly , hysteresis effects will become smaller .",
    "if the external driving force @xmath155 is changed faster and the domain wall motion becomes non - adiabatic - in the sense that e.g. the velocity hysteresis becomes pronounced  @xcite  several effects should be mentioned  @xcite : first the magnetization hysteresis gets wider since the domain wall can not follow the changes of the magnetic field anymore , leading to a greater separation of the double peaks of @xmath156 .",
    "furthermore the change in the magnetization from @xmath157 to @xmath158 will become smeared out leading to a broadening of the resistivity peaks .",
    "in addition to these _ visual _ effects a phase shift between the magnetic field and magnetization appears .",
    "the shape of the magnetization curves near the saturation points depends also on boundary effects - in the simulation @xmath6 was simply restricted by the system border , but no additional surface pinning effects were taken into account .",
    "the qualitative picture remains , however , the same .",
    "in our model we consider only one domain wall .",
    "therefore , we comment under which conditions this model is justified , in particular why dipolar domain wall interaction can be neglected . since the dipolar interaction between walls is of coulomb type it is proportional to @xmath159 ( in 2d ) , where @xmath63 is the typical distance between domain walls  @xcite . from this",
    "we can introduce a typical time scale for the domain wall interaction as @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the charge of the walls . if the frequency of the external magnetic field is larger than @xmath162 the contribution of domain wall interaction can be neglected .",
    "in other words if domain wall fluctuations due to interaction are slow ( e.g. for large spatial distances between them ) compared to the motion induced by the driving force , the former motion has no influence on the sample resistivity .",
    "we assume this in our model and therefore consider only one domain wall . the spiked domain structure observed in lmoke micrographs in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be described in detail by our model .",
    "however , the effect of these structures on the magnetoresistance can be assumed to be small such that a coarse grained picture with only one wall will describe the transport correctly , at least on a qualitative level .",
    "we remark , that samples with a single domain wall can be created , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite where an ultrathin pt / co / pt film was prepared with one moving wall , and model ( [ eq.motion ] ) was successfully applied to describe the magnetic susceptibility of nanogranular magnets  @xcite .    in general , also",
    "dipolar interactions within one domain wall have to be considered in the hamiltonian for the wall , leading to an additional term in eq .",
    "( [ eq.motion ] ) .",
    "this term describes the interaction between dipoles via coulomb forces . since the dipolar axis is usually parallel to the wall this additional term represents only a renormalization of the elastic term which can be seen in eq .",
    "( 25 ) of ref .",
    "therefore its influence is hidden in our phenomenological constant @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.motion ] ) .    in conclusion , we have studied the giant magnetoresistance of nanogranular magnets in the presence of an external magnetic field and finite temperature .",
    "we have shown that the magnetization of arrays of nanogranular magnets has hysteretic behaviour at low temperatures leading to a double peak in the magnetoresistance which coalesces in the spm state to a single one .",
