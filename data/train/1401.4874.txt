    "we believe this strategy to be inherently more suited to disordered systems  the results presented here show that the accuracy of tsdrg is already comparable to vmps without including any additional variational updates .",

    "we have checked that tsdrg , just as the sdrg of hikihara,@xcite is also able to model random fm / afm couplings that create large effective spins as the renormalization progresses . as such it may be possible to use our approach to study higher spin systems given a suitably high @xmath38 .",
    "it should also be fairly simple to extend the tsdrg method to periodic systems by introducing a bond between the first and last mpo tensor , which is effectively taking a trace over the mpo .",
    "we note that implementation of _ on - site disorder _ , such as in the random transverse field ising model,@xcite does not appear to have a natural implementation using the local rg outlined in section [ sec : nsdrg ] . here",
    "it may be possible to implement a tensor network with a different structure , but at the moment it is not clear to us how this would be performed .",
    "the tensor network approach makes finding other expectation values , i.e.  in addition to those studied here , straightforward as they are simply the contraction of the set of isometries with a matrix operator .",
    "an example is the _ _ string order parameter__@xcite that is used to find a hidden topological order in the ground state.@xcite if the entanglement entropy can be found , so too can the entanglement spectrum , which has become a popular means of characterising many - body wave functions,@xcite for better or for worse.@xcite excited states can be found by diagonalising the top tensor and instead of keeping the lowest energy eigenvector , one keeps a suitable set of higher energy eigenvectors .",
    "this will only be accurate for low energy excitations as at each step of the renormalization process only the low energy components are kept while information about higher energy modes is discarded .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that when moving far away from the ground state the geometry of the network is no longer appropriate .",
    "our local rg procedure selects spin pairs based on energy gaps .",
    "it is tempting to reformulate this based on the local entanglement content of such pairs .",
